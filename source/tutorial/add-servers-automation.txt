Procedure
---------

Install the {+mdbagent+} on each host that you want |mms| to manage.

MongoDB without a package manager, use an archive to install the
{+mdbagent+}.

Next Steps

Once you have installed the {+mdbagent+} to all your hosts, you can
deploy your first :doc:`replica set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>`,
