What’s New in MongoDB 2.4
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB 2.4 represents hundreds of improvements and features driven
by user requests. MongoDB 2.4 builds on the momentum of 2.2 by
introducing new features that enable greater developer productivity,
easier operations, improved performance and enhanced security. MongoDB
2.4 is available for `download on MongoDB.org
<http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>`_.

Developer Productivity
----------------------

- Aggregation Framework refinements include an overhaul of the
  underlying engine introduced in MongoDB 2.2 making it easier to
  leverage real-time, in-place analytics. MongoDB 2.4 includes
  significant performance improvements, additional support for binary
  data, support for :operator:`$geoWithin` and :operator:`$near` geospatial
  queries, improved string concatenation with the new :expression:`$concat`
  operator, and improved date calculation semantics.

- Geospatial enhancements support new use cases with support for
  polygon intersection queries (with :operator:`$geoIntersects`),
  support for :term:`GeoJSON`, and an improved spherical model. Learn
  more about :ref:`geospatial improvements in 2 <2.4-release-geospatial>`.

- Text Search provides a simplified, integrated approach to
  incorporating search functionality into apps with support for
  language specific stemming and stop words in 15 languages and real
  time indexes. Text search is beta for 2.4 and is not
  recommended for production use. Learn more about :ref:`text search
  <2.4-release-text-indexes>`.

- New update semantics for arrays with the :operator:`$push` update
  operator. Applications can now use :operator:`$slice` to maintain
  fixed size arrays, and use :operator:`$sort` to maintain sorted
  arrays. Learn more about :ref:`capped arrays
  <2.4-fixed-size-arrays>`.

- New :operator:`$setOnInsert` update operator supports specifying
  fields to add only on insert and :term:`upsert` operations.

Ease of Operations
------------------

- Hashed indexes and shard keys provide simple, even distribution for
  reads and writes. Learn more about :ref:`hashed indexes and shard
  keys <2.4-release-hashed-indexes>`.

- New :dbcommand:`serverStatus` metrics including a working set
  analysis tool makes capacity planning easier for operations
  teams. Learn more about the new :ref:`serverStatus metrics
  <2.4-release-server-status>` including the :ref:`working set
  analyzer <server-status-workingset>`.

- More control for operators with the ability to terminate indexing
  operations with automatic resource cleanup.

Improved Performance
--------------------

- V8 JavaScript engine offers better performance and concurrency with
  JavaScript based actions including those using the
  :operator:`$where` query operator as well as :dbcommand:`mapReduce`
  and :dbcommand:`eval`. Learn more about :ref:`MongoDB on V8
  <2.4-release-javascript-change>`, and
  :doc:`/release-notes/2.4-javascript`.

- Improvements to :dbcommand:`count` provide dramatically faster count
  operations. Counting is now up to 20 times faster for low cardinality
  index based counts.

- Significant optimizations to :operator:`$elemMatch` when using a
  multi-key index.

More Robust Security
--------------------

- Role-Based privileges allow organizations to assign more granular
  security policies for server, database and cluster
  administration. Learn more about :doc:`role based access control in
  MongoDB </reference/user-privileges>`.

- Kerberos authentication mechanism in MongoDB Enterprise.

MongoDB Enterprise
------------------

MongoDB Enterprise is a commercial edition of MongoDB that includes
enterprise-grade capabilities, such as advanced security features,
management tools, software integrations and certifications. Available
as part of the MongoDB Enterprise Subscription, this edition includes
10gen’s most comprehensive SLA and a commercial license. Continue
