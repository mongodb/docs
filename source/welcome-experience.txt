The Getting Started tutorial guides you through possible ways of beginning
your use of |charts|. New |charts-short| users or users who have not
previously used dashboards in |charts-short| are prompted to walk
through the Getting Started tutorial. Refer to the following sections for
information on the possible paths that the Getting Started tutorial offers:

- :ref:`Connect Your Data Sources <welcome-connect-data>`

- :ref:`Explore with Sample Data <welcome-explore-data>`

- :ref:`welcome-skip-to-dashboards`

.. _welcome-connect-data:

Connect Your Data Sources
-------------------------

Use the :guilabel:`Connect Your Data` path to connect your existing
|service| deployments to |charts| and visualize your data. 

Requirements & Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You must have an existing |service| deployment.

  .. include:: /includes/deployment-description.rst

  If you do not have an
  existing |service| deployment, you can 
  :ref:`Explore Charts with Sample Data <welcome-explore-data>`.

- You must have read access in your project role to connect
  |charts-short| to your data. To learn more about |service| project
  roles, see :atlas:`Atlas Project Roles
  </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>`

.. _welcome-explore-data:

Explore with Sample Data
------------------------

|charts| provides a :ref:`Sample Dashboard <sample-dashboard>` that uses movie data to show
examples of possible charts you can create. You can also use the
:ref:`sample data source <charts-sample-data>` to create your own charts on
other dashboards. 

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/sample-dashboard.rst

.. note::
  
   If you remove the :guilabel:`Sample Dashboard`, you can add it back
   through the :ref:`Dashboards <sample-dashboard>` page. 

.. _welcome-skip-to-dashboards:

Skip to Shared Data Sources or Dashboards
-----------------------------------------

If you have already been granted access to data sources or dashboards
prior to completing the Getting Started tutorial, you can bypass the tutorial
and immediately begin viewing your shared data sources and
dashboards.

To exit the Getting Started tutorial and begin exploring your shared
data sources and dashboards, click
:guilabel:`Skip selection and view` at the bottom of the tutorial view.
