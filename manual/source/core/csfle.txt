Introduction
------------

{+csfle+} ({+csfle-abbrev+}) is a feature that enables you to encrypt data in your
application before you send it over the network to MongoDB. With {+csfle-abbrev+}
enabled, no MongoDB product has access to your data in an unencrypted form.

You can set up {+csfle-abbrev+} using the following mechanisms:

- Automatic Encryption: Enables you to perform encrypted read and
  write operations without having to add explicit calls to encrypt and decrypt 
  fields.
- {+manual-enc-title+}: Enables you to perform encrypted read and write
  operations through your MongoDB driver's encryption library. You must
  specify the logic for encryption with this library throughout your
  application.

Considerations
--------------

When implementing an application that uses {+csfle+}, consider the points listed in :ref:`Security Considerations <qe-csfle-security-considerations>`.

For limitations, see :ref:`{+csfle-abbrev+} limitations
<csfle-reference-encryption-limits>`.
