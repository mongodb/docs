  .. admonition:: Recommend Using |tls-ssl| with |ldap|
     :class: warning

     By default, |ldap| traffic is sent as plain text. This means that
     credentials (username and password) are exposed to basic network
     threats like sniffers and replay. Use |ldaps| (|ldap| over 
     |tls-ssl|) to encrypt authentication. Many modern directory 
     services, such as Active Directory, require encrypted  
     connections.
