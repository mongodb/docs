   If your source replica set is running a MongoDB version 4.4 or 5.0 and you are 
   migrating to a destination replica set running MongoDB 6.0, you can the legacy 
   live migration options described in this section to migrate to destination 
   {+clusters+} in |service|.

   For legacy migration, you use the {+atlas-ui+} to either pull a MongoDB replica set
   into an |service| replica set, or push data from a source replica set
   monitored in |mms| to a destination in |service|.

   If you must use legacy live migration (push) to migrate a source sharded
   {+cluster+}, upgrade it to MongoDB 6.0 or later, and then migrate it to |service| 
   using :ref:`this live migration (push) procedure <c2c-push-live-migration>`.

   You can also use self-managed tools to migrate manually, load files, and
   seed or import data.
