title: "Configure {{mechanism}} for the Agents."
content: |

  You can enable more than one authentication mechanism for your MongoDB
  deployment, but the |mms| Agents can only use *one* authentication
  mechanism. Select {{mechanism}} to connect to your MongoDB deployment.

  a. Select {{mechanism}} from the :guilabel:`Agent Auth Mechanism`
     drop-down menu.

  b. For each Agent, provide:

     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 30 70

        * - Setting
          - Value

        * - :guilabel:`<Agent> Kerberos Principal`
          - Enter the Kerberos Principal.

        * - :guilabel:`<Agent> Keytab path`
          - Provide the path for the Agent's Keytab.

        * - :guilabel:`<Agent> LDAP Group DN` 
          - Enter the Distinguished Name for the Agent's LDAP Group.

            The LDAP Group DN is then created as a role in MongoDB to
            grant the Agent the appropriate privileges.

            .. note:: 
               You only need to provide the Agent's LDAP Group DN if you
               use LDAP Authorization.

  c. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

  Only configure the Agents you installed.

  .. example::
     If you did not install the Backup Agent, do not configure the
     Backup agent.
