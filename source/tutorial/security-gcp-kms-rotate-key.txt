|service| does *not* automatically rotate the Key Version Resource ID
used for |gcp| key management.

|service| automatically creates an
:alert:`encryption key rotation alert <GCP encryption key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days>`
to remind you to rotate your GCP Key Version Resource ID every 90 days
by default when you :ref:`enable Encryption at Rest <security-gcp-kms>`
for |a-service| project.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must create a new Service Account Key in the |gcp| account
associated with your |service| project.

Procedure
---------

The following procedure documents how to rotate your |service| project Key Identifier by specifying a new Key Version Resource ID in |service|.

.. include:: /includes/steps/rotate-gcp-encryption-key.rst

Alerts
------

:alert:`encryption key rotation alert <GCP encryption key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days>`
timer at the completion of this procedure.
