==================
A->B->C Migrations

Syntax 
------

To perform an A->B->C migration, run the following commands when starting 
:ref:`mongosync <c2c-mongosync>`: 

.. code-block:: shell

   ./bin/mongosync \
         --cluster0 <cluster-A-connection-string> \
         --cluster1 <cluster-B-connection-string> \
         --migrationName <string>

   ./bin/mongosync \
         --cluster0 <cluster-B-connection-string> \
         --cluster1 <cluster-C-connection-string> \
         --migrationName <string>

To start the sync operation between the source and destination clusters, see 
:ref:`c2c-quickstart-synchronize`.

Behavior 
--------

The first migration (A->B) must finish :ref:`committing <c2c-api-commit>` 
before the second migration (B->C) starts committing. 

.. warning:: 

   If the second migration starts committing before the first migration 
   finishes, you may experience data loss.

   Before you use any experimental {+c2c-beta-program-short+} features, 
   review the :ref:`{+c2c-full-beta-program+} Disclaimer 
   <c2c-beta-program>`.


For better performance, ensure that the first migration (A->B) reaches 
``change event application`` before the second migration (B->C) starts. To 
see if a migration reached ``change event application``, check the ``info`` 
field in the :ref:`c2c-api-progress` response document.

Cluster B Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writes from cluster A and reads from cluster C can result in heavy loads for
cluster B. Ensure that cluster B is sufficiently sized and can handle simultaneous
read and write loads.

Example 
-------

The following example performs two consecutive migrations that:

#. Connect a source cluster running on port ``27000`` with a destination 
   cluster running on port ``27001``.

#. Use the destination cluster running on port ``27001`` as a source cluster 
   for the second migration. 

#. Connect the source cluster on port ``27001`` with a destination cluster 
   running on port ``27002``.

The command also sets ``--migrationName`` to describe the operations and store 
migration metadata for each sync.

.. code-block:: shell

   ./bin/mongosync \
         --cluster0 "mongodb://localhost:27000" \
         --cluster1 "mongodb://localhost:27001" \
         --migrationName "cluster_27000_to_cluster_27001_sync"

   ./bin/mongosync \
         --cluster0 "mongodb://localhost:27001" \
         --cluster1 "mongodb://localhost:27002" \
         --migrationName "cluster_27001_to_cluster_27002_sync"
