      * - Field

        - Contents

      * - :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>`

        - Type in one or more hosts in the ``<hostname:port>`` format
          that comprise the blockstore database.

          - If the blockstore database is a Replica Set or Sharded
            Cluster, type a comma-separated list of :program:`mongod`
            instances (for a Replica Set) or :program:`mongos`
            instances (for a Sharded Cluster).

            .. example::

               .. code-block:: sh

                  host1.example.com:27017,
                  host2.example.com:27017,
                  host2.example.com:27018

          - If the blockstore database is a standalone MongoDB
            instance, type the ``hostname:port`` of the instance.

      * - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Username` (Optional)

        - If the S3 blockstore database uses Username and Password
          (SCRAM-SHA-1) authentication, type the name of the user
          authorized to access the S3 blockstore database.

          Blockstore databases only support Username and Password
          (SCRAM-SHA-1) authentication.

          To enable Username and Password (SCRAM-SHA-1) authentication
          on your blockstore database, see :manual:`how to configure
          your database for SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication 
          </core/security-scram-sha-1>` in the MongoDB manual.

      * - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password` (Optional)

        - If the database uses Username and Password (SCRAM-SHA-1)
          authentication, type the password associated with the
          username that can access the blockstore database.

      * - :guilabel:`Encrypted Credentials` (Optional)

        - Select if the Username and Password for the database were encrypted
          using the ``credentialstool``. For details on the
          ``credentialstool``, see :ref:`encrypt-mongodb-user-credentials`.

      * - :guilabel:`Use TLS/SSL` (Optional)

        - Select if the blockstore database only accepts connection
          encrypted using :abbr:`TLS (Transport Layer Security)`.

          To enable TLS on the blockstore database, see 
          :manual:`Configure mongod and mongos for TLS/SSL </tutorial/configure-ssl>`.

      * - :guilabel:`Connection Options` (Optional)

        - Type any additional :manual:`configuration file options </reference/configuration-options>`
          for the MongoDB instance. This field supports unescaped values only.

      * - :guilabel:`Assignment Labels` (Optional)

        - Type a comma-separated list of labels to assign the
          blockstores to specific groups.

      * - :guilabel:`Blockstore Max Capacity (GB)` (Optional)

        - Type a maximum size for a blockstore.

      * - :guilabel:`Load Factor` (Optional)

        - Type any positive integer that expresses how much backup work
          you want this snapshot store to perform compared to another
          snapshot store.

          .. important::
             If you do not have more than one snapshot store, skip this
             setting.

          Backup work includes running backups, restoring snapshots or
          :term:`grooming <groom>` blockstores. The term of backup work
          ratio assigned to a single snapshot store is called its *Load
          Factor*.

          By default, |mms| assigns each snapshot store a
          :guilabel:`Load Factor` of ``1``. This means each snapshot
          store would perform the same amount of backup work.

          As a snapshot store's :guilabel:`Load Factor` increases, it
          performs more backup work compared to another snapshot store.
          If the :guilabel:`Load Factor` of snapshot store ``A`` is set
          to ``2`` and the :guilabel:`Load Factor` of snapshot store
          ``B`` is set to ``1``, ``A`` performs two times the backup
          work of ``B``.

          .. example:: **How to estimate Load Factor**

             Consider a five-shard sharded cluster with the
             following backup storage configuration:
             
             - File system store (``F``) manages the backup work for
               one shard in the cluster. ``F`` is running on a single
               two-core physical server.

             - Blockstore (``B``) manages the backup work for four
               shards in the cluster. ``B`` is running as a four-node
               sharded cluster on four physical servers with two cores
               on each server.

             In this example, ``B`` has four times the capability of
             ``F``. ``B`` should receive the greater part of the ratio
             of backup work: ``4:1``. For every one backup task ``F``
             performs, ``B`` performs ``4``. 

             Set the Load Factors of ``B`` to ``4`` and ``F`` to ``1``.

          Snapshot stores with greater compute or storage performance
          should be given a greater :guilabel:`Load Factor`:

          - A file system store with 16-cores and 128 GB of RAM can
            back up more databases in less time than a file system
            store with only 2 cores and 8 GB of RAM.

          - A blockstore backed by a 10-node sharded cluster can back
            up more databases and groom more databases than a
            blockstore backed by a single replica set.

          :guilabel:`Load Factor` can be set to ``0``. When one 
          snapshot store's :guilabel:`Load Factor` is set to ``0``, it
          performs no backup work at all. If a snapshot store's
          :guilabel:`Load Factor` is changed while backup work is in
          progress, all jobs or tasks running on that snapshot store
          are allowed to finish. All future backup work then is re-
          distributed among the remaining snapshot stores with a
          :guilabel:`Load Factor` of ``1`` or greater and have
          :guilabel:`Assignment Enabled` selected.

      * - :guilabel:`Write Concern`

        - Select your preferred :manual:`Write Concern</core/write-concern/>`:

          .. list-table::
             :widths: 30 70
             :stub-columns: 1
 
             * - Default
               - The write is not acknowledged.
             * - Journaled
               - A primary or standalone database acknowledged the write and
                 wrote that write to their on-disk :term:`journals <journal>`.
             * - Acknowledged
               - A primary or standalone acknowledged the write.
             * - Replica Acknowledged
               - More than one of the replica set members acknowledged the write.
             * - Majority
               - A majority of the replica set members acknowledged the write.
