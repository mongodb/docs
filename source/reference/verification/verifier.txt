Migration Verifier connects to the source and destination clusters and performs
a series of verification checks, comparing documents, views, and indexes to
confirm the sync was successful.

Unlike other verification methods, Migration Verifier can run concurrently with
``mongosync``, checking documents on the destination cluster as they sync. This
can reduce the amount of time needed to verify the success of the sync before
transferring your application load from the source to the destination cluster.

About This Task
---------------

.. note::

   Migration Verifier does not support DDL operations. Do not run any DDL 
   operations on the source cluster while verifying data with Migration Verifier. 

For installation instructions and usage limitations, see
`GitHub <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/migration-verifier>`__.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Sync Clusters

      Sync the source and destination clusters using ``mongosync``. For more 
      information, see :ref:`c2c-quickstart`.

   .. step:: Wait for ``mongosync`` to reach CEA 

      Before you can start verification checks with Migration Verifier,
      you must wait until ``mongosync`` reaches the Change Event Application
      (CEA) phase.

      To check that ``mongosync`` has reached the CEA phase, send the
      :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>` command and check that the
      ``progress.info`` field returns ``change event application``.

      .. io-code-block::

         .. input:: 
            :language: bash

            curl localhost:27182/api/v1/progress -XGET

         .. output::
            :language: json
            :emphasize-lines: 7

            {
               "progress":
                  {
                     "state":"RUNNING",
                     "canCommit":true,
                     "canWrite":false,
                     "info":"change event application",
                     "lagTimeSeconds":0,
                     "collectionCopy":
                        {
                           "estimatedTotalBytes":694,
                           "estimatedCopiedBytes":694
                        },
                     "directionMapping":
                        {
                           "Source":"cluster0: localhost:27017",
                           "Destination":"cluster1: localhost:27018"
                        }
                  }
            }
   .. step:: Start Migration Verifier

      Start the ``migration-verifier`` process:

      .. code-block:: bash

         migration-verifier --verifyAll \
            --srcURI example.net:27020 \
            --destURI example.net:27021 \
            --metaURI example.net:27017

   .. step:: Start the Verification Checks

      To start the verification checks, use cURL to send the ``check`` command to
      Migration Verifier:

      .. code-block:: bash

         curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
             -X POST -d '{}' http://127.0.0.1:27020/api/v1/check

   .. step:: Signal Sync Completion

      When the sync is complete and ``mongosync`` has 
      reached the ``COMMITTED`` state, use cURL to send the ``writesOff`` 
      command to Migration Verifier:

      .. code-block:: bash

         curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
             -X POST -d '{}' http://127.0.0.1:27020/api/v1/writesOff

   .. step:: Check Progress

      To view the results, use cURL to send the ``progress`` command to
      Migration Verifier.

      .. io-code-block::

         .. input::
            :language: bash

            curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
               -X GET http://127.0.0.1:27020/api/v1/progress

         .. output::
            :language: json

            {
               "progress": {
                  "phase": "idle",
                  "error": null,
                  "verificationStatus": {
                     "totalTasks": 1,
                     "addedTasks": 0,
                     "processingTasks": 0,
                     "failedTasks": 0,
                     "completedTasks": 0,
                     "metadataMismatchTasks": 0,
                     "recheckTasks": 0
                  }
               }
            }


      When the ``phase`` field is ``idle``, the verification checks are
      complete. If the ``failedTasks`` field returns 0, the sync was successful.
