         contains your desired project from the
         :guilabel:`Organizations` menu in the navigation bar.
      #. If it is not already displayed, select your desired project
         from the :guilabel:`Projects` menu in the navigation  bar.
      #. If the :guilabel:`Database Deployments` page is not already

         .. include:: /includes/default-fts-index-name.rst 

      #. In the :guilabel:`Database and Collection` section, find the 
         ``sample_mflix`` database, and select the ``movies``
         collection.

   .. step:: Define the |fts| index. 

      a. Replace the default definition with the following.

         The following index definition indexes the ``title`` field as
         the following types:  
          
         - :ref:`token <bson-data-types-token>` type for sorting, which  
           uses the ``lowercase`` normalizer to convert the indexed term
           to lowercase. 
         - :ref:`string <bson-data-types-string>` type for querying
           the field.

         .. code-block:: json 
            :copyable: true 
            :linenos: 

            {
              "mappings": {
                "dynamic": false,
                "fields": {
                  "title": [{
                    "type": "token",
                    "normalizer": "lowercase"
                  },{
                    "type": "string"
                  }]
                }
              }
            }

      #. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create Search Index`.

      A modal window displays to let you know that your index is building.

   .. step:: Close the :guilabel:`You're All Set!` modal window by clicking :guilabel:`Close` and wait for the index to finish building. 

      The index should take about one minute to build. While it is
      building, the :guilabel:`Status` column reads :guilabel:`Initial
      Sync`. When it is finished building, the :guilabel:`Status` column
      reads :guilabel:`Active`.
