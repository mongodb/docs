Manual Installation
-------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-osx-manual.rst

Run MongoDB
-----------

Set Up the Data Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you start :binary:`~bin.mongod` for the first time, you will need to
create the data directory. By default, :binary:`~bin.mongod` writes data to
the :file:`/data/db/` directory.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-set-up-dbpath-osx.rst

You can specify an alternate path for data files using the
:option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option to :binary:`~bin.mongod`. If
you use an alternate location for your data directory, ensure that the
alternate directory has the appropriate permissions.

Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start :binary:`~bin.mongod`, run the executable :binary:`~bin.mongod` at the
system prompt.

For example, if your ``PATH`` includes the location of the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` binary, enter ``mongod`` at the system prompt.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod

If your ``PATH`` does not include the location of the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
binary, enter the full path to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary.

The previous command starts a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that writes
data to the ``/data/db/`` directory. To specify an alternate data
directory, start :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the :option:`--dbpath <mongod
--dbpath>` option:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --dbpath <some alternate directory>

Whether using the default :file:`/data/db/` or an alternate directory,
ensure that the user account running :binary:`~bin.mongod` has read and
write permissions to the directory.

Stop MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To stop the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, press ``Control+C`` in the
terminal where the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is running.
