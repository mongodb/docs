==============================
Restore from a Stored Snapshot
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

With |backup|, you can restore from a stored snapshot or
build a :doc:`custom snapshot
</tutorial/restore-from-point-in-time-snapshot>` reflecting a
different point in the last 24 hours. For all backups, restoring from
a stored snapshot is faster than restoring from a custom snapshot in the
last 24 hours.

|backup| automatically takes and stores a snapshot every 6 hours. These
snapshots are available for restores following the snapshot
retention policy. For more information about the snapshot retention policy, as
well as setting your own retention policy, see :ref:`the MMS Backup FAQ
<faq-backup>`.

For replica sets, you will receive one ``.tar.gz`` file containing your data; for
sharded clusters, you will receive a series of ``.tar.gz`` files.
