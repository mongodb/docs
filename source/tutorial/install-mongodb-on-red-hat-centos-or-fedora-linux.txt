Install MongoDB on Red Hat Enterprise, CentOS, Fedora, or Amazon Linux

Overview
--------

Use this tutorial to install MongoDB on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS
Linux, Fedora Linux, or a related system. The tutorial uses ``.rpm``
packages to install. While some of these distributions include their own
MongoDB packages, the official MongoDB packages are generally more up to
date.

.. The following include includes two h2 headers:
.. Packages and Control Scripts

.. |init-script-path| replace:: ``/etc/rc.d/init.d/mongod``

.. include:: /includes/list-mongodb-org-packages.rst

.. warning::

   With the introduction of ``systemd`` in Fedora 15, the control scripts
   included in the packages available in the MongoDB downloads repository
   are not compatible with Fedora systems. A correction is
   forthcoming, see :issue:`SERVER-7285` for more information, and in
   the mean time use your own control scripts *or* install using the
   procedure outlined in :doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-linux`.

Considerations
--------------

For production deployments, always run MongoDB on 64-bit systems.

The default ''/etc/mongodb.conf'' configuration file supplied by the 2.6 series
''.rpm'' package has ''bind_ip'' set to ''127.0.0.1'' by default. Ensure that this
is changed to the appropriate value for your environment before activating a
:term:`replica set <replica set>`.

Run MongoDB
-----------

.. important:: You must configure SELinux to allow MongoDB to start on
   Fedora systems. Administrators have two options:

   - enable access to the relevant ports (e.g. 27017) for SELinux. See
     :ref:`security-port-numbers` for more information on MongoDB's
     :doc:`default ports </reference/default-mongodb-port>`.

   - disable SELinux entirely. This requires a system reboot and may have
     larger implications for your deployment.

The MongoDB instance stores its data files in ``/var/lib/mongo``
and its log files in ``/var/log/mongo``, and runs using the ``mongod``
user account. If you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you
**must** modify the access control rights to the ``/var/lib/mongodb`` and
``/var/log/mongodb`` directories.
