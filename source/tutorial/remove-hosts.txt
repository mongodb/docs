Remove Hosts
============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can remove hosts that you no longer use, but when you do they are
hidden permanently. If you run the instance again, MMS will not discover
it. If you choose to :doc:`add </tutorial/add-hosts-to-monitoring>` the
host again, MMS will **not** display it.

.. only:: classic or cloud

   Only `MMS Support <https://mms.mongodb.com/links/support>`_ can
   undelete it.

.. only:: onprem

   Only a global administrator can undelete the host so that it will again
   display if added. The administrator can add the host back through the
   :guilabel:`Deleted Hosts` page in the MMS :guilabel:`Admin` interface.

Instead of removing a host, you can optionally disable alerts for the
host, which does not remove it from the monitoring pages. See
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-host-alerts`.
