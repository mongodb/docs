.. method:: rs.status()

   Returns the replica set status from the point of view of the member
   where the method is run. 

   .. |dbcommand| replace:: :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` command
   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongo-shell-method-alt

   This output reflects the current status of the replica set, using
   data derived from the heartbeat packets sent by the other members
   of the replica set.

Output
------

For an example and details on the output, see :ref:`replSetGetStatus
<rs-status-output>`.

- Starting in MongoDB 4.2.1
      If you run :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell helper
      :method:`rs.status()` (or the :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus`
      command) on a member during its :ref:`initial sync
      <replica-set-initial-sync>` (i.e. :replstate:`STARTUP2` state),
      the command returns :data:`replSetGetStatus.initialSyncStatus`
      metrics.
      
      Once the member completes its initial sync, the
      :data:`replSetGetStatus.initialSyncStatus` metrics becomes
      unavailable.
      
- In earlier versions (3.4.x-4.2.0)
      To return :ref:`initial sync <replica-set-initial-sync>` status
      information, you must the :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` command
      with the ``initialSync: 1`` option on a secondary member or a
      member in :replstate:`STARTUP2` state:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand( { replSetGetStatus: 1, initialSync: 1 } )

      The :data:`replSetGetStatus.initialSyncStatus` metrics remains
      available after the member completes its initial sync. That is,
      you can run the :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` command with the
      ``initialSync: 1`` on the secondary member to return its initial
      sync information.

      You cannot specify ``initialSync: 1`` in the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
      shell helper :method:`rs.status()`.
