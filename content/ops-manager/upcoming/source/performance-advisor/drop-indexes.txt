The Performance Advisor suggests dropping unused, redundant, and hidden 
indexes to improve write performance and increase storage space. 

.. seealso::

   To learn more about the impact of unnecessary indexes, see 
   :ref:`indexes-anti-pattern`.

Unused Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An index is unused if it doesn't support any queries.

The Performance Advisor flags an index as unused if it hasn't supported 
a query in 7 or more days after it was created or the server was 
restarted.

Redundant Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An index is redundant if another index supports any query that it could.

The Performance Advisor flags an index as redundant if it matches the 
prefix of another index in the same collection.

.. example::

   If a collection contains the indexes:

   - ``{ a: 1 }``
   - ``{ b: -1 }``
   - ``{ a: 1, b: -1 }``
   
   ``{ a: 1 }`` is redundant because it matches the prefix 
   ``{ a: 1, b: -1 }``.

   ``{ b: -1 }`` is not redundant because it does not match any prefix.

In the Performance Advisor, redundant indexes are marked with a red 
``Redundant`` badge. Below each redundant index, the Performance 
Advisor displays the related indexes that cover it.

.. note::
  
   Related indexes are displayed for you to verify that the redundant 
   index can be dropped safely. Related indexes are not recommended 
   for removal.

.. _hidden-indexes:

Hidden Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*New in MongoDB version 4.4*

Hidden indexes aren't used to support queries. They still impact write 
performance and consume storage space.

Hiding an index is useful for evaluating the impact of removing an 
index before doing so. Unhiding an index is much easier than 
rebuilding a deleted index.

.. seealso::

   To learn more about hidden indexes, see 
   :manual:`Hidden Indexes </core/index-hidden/>` in the MongoDB manual.

To hide an index with the Performance Advisor, see 
:ref:`Drop or Hide an Index <pa-drop-index-procedure>`.

To unhide an index, see 
:manual:`Unhide an Existing Index </core/index-hidden/#unhide-an-existing-index>` 
in the MongoDB manual.

The Performance Advisor always recommends dropping hidden indexes. 
After you are confident a hidden index is unnecessary, drop it.

Drop or Hide an Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   MongoDB recommends hiding indexes before you 
   drop them. :ref:`Hidden Indexes <hidden-indexes>` are available in 
   MongoDB version 4.4 and higher.
