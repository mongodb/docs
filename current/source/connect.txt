Overview
--------

This page contains code examples that show how to connect your C++ application
to MongoDB with various settings.

.. tip::

  To learn more about the connection options on this page, see the link
  provided in each section.

To use a connection example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <cpp-connect-sample>` or your own application.
Be sure to replace all placeholders in the code examples, such as ``<hostname>``, with
the relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.

Connection
----------

Atlas
~~~~~

The following code shows how to connect to a MongoDB Atlas deployment:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-atlas
    :end-before: end-atlas

To learn more about connecting to an Atlas deployment, see :ref:`cpp-connection-atlas`
in the Connection Targets guide.

Local Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to connect to a local MongoDB deployment:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-local
    :end-before: end-local

To learn more about connecting to a local deployment, see :ref:`cpp-connection-local`
in the Connection Targets guide.

Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to connect to a replica set deployment:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-replica-set
    :end-before: end-replica-set

To learn more about connecting to a replica set, see :ref:`cpp-connection-replica-set`
in the Connection Targets guide.

Transport Layer Security (TLS)
------------------------------

Enable TLS
~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to enable TLS for the connection to your
MongoDB instance:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-enable-tls
    :end-before: end-enable-tls

To learn more about enabling TLS, see :ref:`cpp-enable-tls` in
the TLS configuration guide.

Specify a Certificate Authority (CA) File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to specify the path to your CA file
for the connection to your MongoDB instance:

.. include:: /includes/connect/ca-file-tabs.rst

To learn more about specifying a CA file, see :ref:`cpp-specify-ca-file` in
the TLS configuration guide.

Disable OCSP Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to prevent the driver from contacting
the OCSP endpoint:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-disable-ocsp
    :end-before: end-disable-ocsp

To learn more about disabling OCSP checks, see :ref:`cpp-disable-ocsp` in
the TLS configuration guide.

Specify a Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to instruct the driver to verify the server's 
certificate against a CRL:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-crl
    :end-before: end-crl

To learn more about specifying a CRL, see :ref:`cpp-crl` in the TLS
configuration guide.

Present a Client Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to specify the client certificate that
the driver presents to your MongoDB deployment:

.. include:: /includes/connect/client-cert-tabs.rst

To learn more about specifying a client certificate, see :ref:`cpp-client-cert` in
the TLS configuration guide.

Provide a Certificate Key File Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to specify the password for your
client certificate:

.. include:: /includes/connect/key-file-password.rst

To learn more about providing a key file password, see :ref:`cpp-key-file-password` in
the TLS configuration guide.

Allow Insecure TLS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to disable certificate verification:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-insecure-tls
    :end-before: end-insecure-tls

To learn more about allowing insecure TLS, see :ref:`cpp-insecure-tls` in
the TLS configuration guide.

Disable Certificate Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to disable certificate validation:

.. include:: /includes/connect/disable-cert-validation-tabs.rst

To learn more about disabling certificate validation, see :ref:`cpp-insecure-tls` in
the TLS configuration guide.

Disable Hostname Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to disable hostname verification:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-disable-hostname
    :end-before: end-disable-hostname

To learn more about disabling hostname verification, see :ref:`cpp-insecure-tls` in
the TLS configuration guide.

Network Compression
-------------------

Compression Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to enable compression for the connection
to your MongoDB instance by specifying each compression algorithm:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-compression-all
    :end-before: end-compression-all

To learn more about specifying compression algorithms, see
:ref:`cpp-enable-compression` in the Network Compression guide.

zlib Compression Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to specify the ``zlib`` compression algorithm
and set its compression level:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-compression-zlib
    :end-before: end-compression-zlib

To learn more about setting the zlib compression level, see
:ref:`cpp-enable-compression` in the Network Compression guide.

{+stable-api+}
--------------

The following code shows how to enable the {+stable-api+} for the
connection to your MongoDB instance:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-stable-api
    :end-before: end-stable-api
