`Public Preview: please provide feedback at <https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/930808-atlas-cli>`_: Returns all legacy backup restore jobs for one cluster in the specified project.

To use this resource, the requesting API Key must have the Project Read Only role.


Effective 23 March 2020, all new clusters can use only Cloud Backups. When you upgrade to 4.2, your backup system upgrades to cloud backup if it is currently set to legacy backup. After this upgrade, all your existing legacy backup snapshots remain available. They expire over time in accordance with your retention policy. Your backup policy resets to the default schedule. If you had a custom backup policy in place with legacy backups, you must re-create it with the procedure outlined in the Cloud Backup documentation. If you use the BATCH-ID query parameter, you can retrieve all restore jobs in the specified batch. When creating a restore job for a sharded cluster, MongoDB Cloud creates a separate job for each shard, plus another for the config server. Each of those jobs are part of a batch. However, a batch can't include a restore job for a replica set.

This command is autogenerated and corresponds 1:1 with the Atlas API endpoint https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Legacy-Backup/operation/listLegacyBackupRestoreJobs.

For more information and examples, see the referenced API documentation linked above.

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Required
     - Description
   * - --batchId
     - string
     - false
     - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies the batch of restore jobs to return. Timestamp in ISO 8601 date and time format in UTC when creating a restore job for a sharded cluster, Application creates a separate job for each shard, plus another for the config host. Each of these jobs comprise one batch. A restore job for a replica set can't be part of a batch.
   * - --clusterName
     - string
     - true
     - Human-readable label that identifies the cluster with the snapshot you want to return.
   * - --envelope
     - envelope
     - false
     - Flag that indicates whether Application wraps the response in an envelope JSON object. Some API clients cannot access the HTTP response headers or status code. To remediate this, set envelope=true in the query. Endpoints that return a list of results use the results object as an envelope. Application adds the status parameter to the response body.
   * - --groupId
     - string
     - true
     - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project. Use the [/groups](#tag/Projects/operation/listProjects) endpoint to retrieve all projects to which the authenticated user has access.
       
       **NOTE**: Groups and projects are synonymous terms. Your group id is the same as your project id. For existing groups, your group/project id remains the same. The resource and corresponding endpoints use the term groups.

     - false
     - help for listLegacyBackupRestoreJobs
   * - --includeCount
     - 
     - false
     - Flag that indicates whether the response returns the total number of items (**totalCount**) in the response.
   * - --itemsPerPage
     - int

   * - --output-file
     - string
     - false
     - file to write the api output to. This flag is required when the output of an endpoint is binary (ex: gzip) and the command is not piped (ex: atlas command > out.zip)
   * - --pageNum
     - int
     - false
     - Number of the page that displays the current set of the total objects that the response returns.
   * - --pretty
     - 
     - false
     - Flag that indicates whether the response body should be in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prettyprint</a> format.
   * - --version
     - string
