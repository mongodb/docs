You can use the ``vectorSearch`` type to index fields for running 
:pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries. You can define the index for the
vector embeddings that you want to query and any additional fields
that you want to use to :ref:`pre-filter <avs-types-filter>` your data. 
Filtering your data is useful to narrow the scope of your semantic search 
and ensure that certain vector embeddings are not considered for comparison, 
such as in a multi-tenant environment.

You can use the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, 
{+atlas-cli+}, {+mongosh+}, or a supported :driver:`MongoDB Driver </>`
to :ref:`create <avs-create-index>` your {+avs+} index. 

.. note:: 

   You can't use the deprecated :ref:`knnBeta <knn-beta-ref>` operator to query
   fields indexed using the ``vectorSearch`` type index definition. 

.. _avs-types-vector-search-considerations:

Considerations 
--------------

In a ``vectorSearch`` type index definition, you can index arrays with
only a single element. You can't index embedding fields inside arrays of documents
or embedding fields inside arrays of objects. You can index embedding fields inside
documents using the dot notation. The same embedding field can't be indexed 
multiple times in the same index defintion.

Before indexing your embeddings, we recommend converting your embeddings
to |bson| :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` vectors with
subtype ``float32``, ``int1``, or ``int8`` for efficient storage
in your {+cluster+}.  To learn more, see :ref:`how to convert
your embeddings to BSON vectors <avs-bindata-vector-subtype>`. 

.. |search-type| replace:: {+avs+}

.. include:: /includes/search-shared/fact-fts-avs-index-resource-consumption.rst

To learn more about sizing considerations for your indexes, 
see :ref:`avs-index-memory-requirements`.

If you make changes to the collection for which you defined {+avs+} 
index, the latest data might not be available immediately for queries.
However, ``mongot`` monitors the change streams and updates stored
copies of data, making {+avs+} indexes eventually consistent. You can
view the number of indexed :guilabel:`Documents` in the {+atlas-ui+} 
to verify that changes to the collection are reflected in the index.

Alternatively, you can create a new index after adding new documents to
your collection and wait for the index to become queryable. You can also
implement a polling logic similar to the following to ensure that the
index is ready for querying before attempting to use it.

.. example:: 

   .. code-block:: 

      console.log("Polling to check if the index is ready. This may take up to a minute.")
      let isQueryable = false;
      while (!isQueryable) {
        const cursor = collection.listSearchIndexes();
        for await (const index of cursor) {
          if (index.name === result) {
            if (index.queryable) {
              console.log(`${result} is ready for querying.`);
              isQueryable = true;
            } else {
              await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
            }
          }
        }
      }

     ]
   }

.. _avs-types-vector-search-options:

{+avs+} Index Fields
----------------------------------

The {+avs+} index definition takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 15 15 45
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Type 
     - Necessity
     - Purpose

   * - ``fields``
     - Array of field definition documents 
     - Required 
     - Definitions for the vector and filter fields to index, one definition per document.
       Each field definition document specifies the ``type``, ``path``, and other configuration options for the field to index. 
       
       The ``fields`` array must contain at least one ``vector``-type field definition. You can add additional
       ``filter``-type field definitions to your array to pre-filter your data. 
       
   * - | ``fields.``
       | ``type``
     - String 
     - Required 
     - Field type to use to index fields for :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`.
       You can specify one of the following values:  
       
       - ``vector`` - for fields that contain vector embeddings.
       - ``filter`` - for additional fields to filter on. You
         can filter on {+avs-filter-types+}.

       To learn more, see :ref:`avs-types-vector` and :ref:`avs-types-filter`.

   * - | ``fields.``
       | ``path``
     - String 
     - Required 
     - Name of the field to index. For nested fields, use dot notation
       to specify path to embedded fields.

   * - | ``fields.``
       | ``numDimensions``
     - Int
     - Required
     - Number of vector dimensions that {+avs+} enforces at index-time and
       query-time. You can set this field only for ``vector``-type fields.
       You must specify a value less than or equal to ``8192``.
       
       For indexing quantized vectors or :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>`,
       you can specify one of the following values:

       - ``1`` to ``8192`` for ``int8`` vectors for ingestion.
       - Multiple of ``8`` for ``int1`` vectors for ingestion.
       - ``1`` to ``8192`` for ``binData(float32)`` and
         ``array(float32)`` vectors for automatic scalar quantization.
       - Multiple of ``8`` for ``binData(float32)`` and
         ``array(float32)`` vectors for automatic binary quantization.
       
       The embedding model you choose determines the number of dimensions
       in your vector embeddings, with some models having multiple options 
       for how many dimensions are output. To learn more, see :ref:`choose-embedding-method`. 

   * - | ``fields.``
       | ``similarity``
     - String
     - Required
     - .. _fields-similarity:
      
       Vector similarity function to use to search for top K-nearest 
       neighbors. You can set this field only for ``vector``-type fields.
       
       You can specify one of the following values:

       - ``euclidean`` - measures the distance between ends of vectors. 
       - ``cosine`` - measures similarity based on the angle between 
         vectors. 
       - ``dotProduct`` - measures similarity like ``cosine``, but takes 
         into account the magnitude of the vector.  
         
       To learn more, see :ref:`avs-similarity-functions`.

   * - | ``fields.``
       | ``quantization``
     - String
     - Optional
     - .. _fields-quantization:

       Type of automatic vector quantization for your vectors. Use
       this setting only if your embeddings are ``float`` or ``double``
       vectors. 
       
       You can specify one of the following values:  

       - ``none`` - Indicates no automatic quantization for the vector
         embeddings. Use this setting if you have pre-quantized vectors
         for ingestion. If omitted, this is the default value. 
       - ``scalar`` - Indicates scalar quantization, which transforms
         values to 1 byte integers.    
       - ``binary`` - Indicates binary quantization, which transforms
         values to a single bit. To use this value,
         ``numDimensions`` must be a multiple of 8. 
         
         If precision is critical, select ``none`` or ``scalar`` instead
         of ``binary``. 

       To learn more, see :ref:`avs-quantization`.

   * - | ``fields.``
       | ``hnswOptions`` 
     - Object 
     - Optional 
     - Parameters to use for |hnsw| graph construction. If omitted, uses
       the default values for the ``maxEdges`` and ``numEdgeCandidates``
       parameters. 

       :gold:`IMPORTANT:` This is available as a Preview feature. Modifying 
       the default values might negatively impact your {+avs+} index and queries.

   * - | ``fields.`` 
       | ``hnswOptions.`` 
       | ``maxEdges``
     - Int
     - Optional 
     - Maximum number of edges (or connections) that a node can have in
       the |hnsw| graph. Value can be between ``16`` and ``64``, both 
       inclusive. If omitted, defaults to ``16``. For example, for a
       value of ``16``, each node can have a maximum of sixteen outgoing
       edges at each layer of the |hnsw| graph.

       A higher number improves :term:`recall` (accuracy of search
       results) because the graph is better connected. However, this
       slows down query speed because of the number of neighbors to
       evaluate per graph node, increases the memory for the |hnsw| graph because each
       node stores more connections, and slows down indexing because
       {+avs+} evaluates more neighbors and adjusts for every new node
       added to the graph. 

   * - | ``fields.``
       | ``hnswOptions.``
       | ``numEdgeCandidates``
     - Int
     - Optional
     - Analogous to ``numCandidates`` at query-time, this parameter
       controls the maximum number of nodes to evaluate to find the
       closest neighbors to connect to a new node. Value can be between
       ``100`` and ``3200``, both inclusive. If omitted, defaults to
       ``100``. 

       A higher number provides a graph with high-quality connections,
       which can improve search quality (recall), but it can also
       negatively affect query latency. 

.. _avs-types-vector:

About the ``vector`` Type 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your index definition's ``vector`` field must contain an array of numbers of 
*one* of the following types: 

- |bson| ``double`` 
- |bson| :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` ``vector``
  subtype ``float32``  
- |bson| :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` ``vector``
  subtype ``int1`` 
- |bson| :manual:`BinData </reference/method/BinData/>` ``vector``
  subtype ``int8`` 

.. note:: 

   To learn more about generating |bson| :manual:`BinData
   </reference/method/BinData/>` vectors with subtype ``float32``
   ``int1`` or ``int8`` for your data, see 
   :ref:`avs-bindata-vector-subtype`.

You must index the vector field as the ``vector`` type inside the
``fields`` array.

The following syntax defines the ``vector`` field type: 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true 
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 4-12

   {
     "fields":[ 
       {
         "type": "vector",
         "path": <field-to-index>,
         "numDimensions": <number-of-dimensions>,
         "similarity": "euclidean | cosine | dotProduct",
         "quantization": "none | scalar | binary",
         "hnswOptions": {
           "maxEdges": <number-of-connected-neighbors>,
           "numEdgeCandidates": <number-of-nearest-neighbors>
         }
       },
       ...
     ]
   }

.. _avs-similarity-functions:

About the Similarity Functions 
``````````````````````````````

{+avs+} supports the following similarity functions: 

- ``euclidean`` - measures the distance between ends of vectors. This
  value allows you to measure similarity based on varying dimensions. To
  learn more, see :wikipedia:`Euclidean <Euclidean_distance>`.  
- ``cosine`` - measures similarity based on the angle between  vectors.
  This value allows you to measure similarity that isn't scaled by
  magnitude. You can't use zero magnitude vectors with ``cosine``. To
  measure cosine similarity, we recommend that you normalize your
  vectors and use ``dotProduct`` instead.  
- ``dotProduct`` - measures similarity like ``cosine``, but takes into
  account the magnitude of the vector. If you normalize the magnitude,
  ``cosine`` and ``dotProduct`` are almost identical in measuring
  similarity.   
         
  To use ``dotProduct``, you must normalize the vector to unit length at
  index-time and query-time.  

The following table shows the similarity functions for the various types:

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 25 25 25 25 
   :header-rows: 1 

   * - Vector Embeddings Type
     - ``euclidean``
     - ``cosine``  
     - ``dotProduct``

   * - ``binData(int1)`` :icon-fa5:`star`
     - √
     - 
     - 

   * - ``binData(int8)`` :icon-fa5:`star`
     - √
     - √
     - √

   * - ``binData(float32)`` :icon-fa5:`asterisk`
     - √
     - √
     - √

   * - ``array(float32)`` :icon-fa5:`asterisk`
     - √
     - √
     - √

:icon-fa5:`star` For vector ingestion.

:icon-fa5:`asterisk` For automatic scalar or binary quantization.

For best performance, check your embedding model to determine which
similarity function aligns with your embedding model's training
process. If you don't have any guidance, start with ``dotProduct``.
Setting ``fields.similarity`` to the ``dotProduct`` value allows you
to efficiently measure similarity based on both angle and magnitude.
``dotProduct`` consumes less computational resources than ``cosine``
and is efficient when vectors are of unit length. However, if your
vectors aren't normalized, evaluate the similarity scores in the
results of a sample query for ``euclidean`` distance and ``cosine``
similarity to determine which corresponds to reasonable results. 

.. _avs-types-filter:

About the ``filter`` Type 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can optionally index additional fields to pre-filter your data. 
You can filter on {+avs-filter-types+}. Filtering your data is useful to
narrow the scope of your semantic search and ensure that not all vectors
are considered for comparison. It reduces the number of documents
against which to run similarity comparisons, which can decrease query
latency and increase the accuracy of search results. 

You must index the fields that you want to filter by using the
``filter`` type inside the ``fields`` array. 

The following syntax defines the ``filter`` field type: 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true 
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 8-9

   {
     "fields":[ 
       {
         "type": "vector",
         ...
       },
       {
         "type": "filter",
         "path": "<field-to-index>"
       },
       ...

      The page displays the following details for the indexes on the page: 

      .. list-table:: 
         :stub-columns: 1 
         :widths: 20 80

         * - Name 
           - Label that identifies the index. 

         * - Index Type
           - Label that indicates a |fts| or {+avs+} index. Values
             include:  
     
             - ``search`` for |fts| indexes.
             - ``vectorSearch`` for {+avs+} indexes.

         * - Index Fields
           - List that contains the fields that this index indexes.

         * - Status
           - Current state of the index on the primary node of the
             {+cluster+}. For valid values, see
             :ref:`avs-node-status-ref`. 

         * - Size
           - Size of the index on the primary node.

         * - Documents 
           - Number of indexed documents out of the total number of
             documents in the collection.

         * - Required Memory
           - Approximate amount of memory required to run 
             vector search queries.

         * - Actions 
           - Actions that you can take on the index. You can:
     
             - :ref:`avs-edit-index`
             - :ref:`avs-delete-index`

             You can't run queries in the :guilabel:`Search Tester` UI
             against indexes of the ``vectorSearch`` type. If you click the
             :guilabel:`Query` button, {+avs+} displays a sample
             :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` that you can copy, modify, and run
             in {+atlas-ui+} and using other
             :ref:`supported clients <vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-clients>`.

.. _avs-edit-index:

Edit a {+avs+} Index
-----------------------------------

You can change the :ref:`index definition <avs-types-vector-search>`
of an existing {+avs+} index from the {+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, 
{+atlas-cli+}, {+mongosh+}, or a supported :driver:`MongoDB Driver </>`. 
You can't rename an index or change the index type. If you need to
change an index name or type, you must create a new index and delete the old one.

.. important::

   After you edit an index, {+avs+} rebuilds it. 
   While the index rebuilds, you can continue to run vector 
   search queries by using the old index definition. 
   When the index finishes rebuilding, the old index is automatically 
   replaced. This process is similar to |fts| indexes. To learn more,
   see :ref:`index-create-and-update`.

Index Status
------------

When you create the {+avs+} index, the :guilabel:`Status` column shows 
the current state of the index on the primary node of the cluster. 
Click the :guilabel:`View status details` link below the status to view 
the state of the index on all the nodes of the cluster.

When the :guilabel:`Status` column reads :guilabel:`Active`, the index
is ready to use. In other states, queries against the index may return
incomplete results.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Status
     - Description

   * - Not Started 
     - |service| has not yet started building the index.

   * - Initial Sync 
     - |service| is building the index or re-building the 
       index after an edit. When the index is in this state:
       
       - For a new index, {+avs+} doesn't serve queries until the 
         index build is complete. 
       - For an existing index, you can continue to use the old index 
         for existing and new queries until the index rebuild 
         is complete.

   * - Active
     - Index is ready to use.

   * - Recovering
     - Replication encountered an error. This state commonly occurs 
       when the current replication point is no longer available on the 
       |mongod| oplog. You can still query the existing index until it 
       updates and its status changes to :guilabel:`Active`. Use the 
       error in the :guilabel:`View status details` modal window to 
       troubleshoot the issue. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`Fix Issues <atlas-search-alerts>`.

   * - Failed 
     - |service| could not build the index. Use the error  
       in the :guilabel:`View status details` modal window to 
       troubleshoot the issue. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`Fix Issues <atlas-search-alerts>`.

   * - Delete in Progress
     - |service| is deleting the index from the cluster nodes.

While |service| builds the index and after the build completes, the 
:guilabel:`Documents` column shows the percentage and number of 
documents indexed. The column also shows the total number of documents 
in the collection.
