|service| provides an option to deploy one ``M0`` Free Tier replica set 
per project. You can :doc:`upgrade </scale-cluster>` an ``M0`` 
Free Tier cluster to an ``M2+`` paid cluster at any time.

``M2`` and ``M5`` instances are low-cost shared starter clusters with
the same features as and functionality as ``M0``, but with increased
storage and the ability to deploy into a subset of regions on Amazon Web
Service (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.

   Support for ``M2`` and ``M5`` clusters is available as a Beta 
   feature. These clusters do not yet support backups.

The following table highlights key differences between an ``M0`` Free 
Tier cluster, an ``M2`` or ``M5`` shared starter cluster, and an 
``M10+``  dedicated cluster.
