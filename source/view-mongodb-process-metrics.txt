   :description: Access and view metrics for specific MongoDB processes in Cloud Manager, including status, hardware, and database statistics.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 2
   :class: singlecol

To view the metrics for a specific MongoDB process in a
|mms| deployment:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
   
   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-deployment.rst

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-processes.rst
    
   .. step:: Go to the process.

      Click the process.
    
The |mms| process view displays the following tabs for monitoring 
metrics for the process:

- The :guilabel:`Status` tab displays the process metrics |mms|
  collects from the selected :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` or
  :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>` process.

- The :guilabel:`Hardware` tab displays hardware metrics for
  the host machine supporting the selected
  :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` or :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>`
  process.

- The :guilabel:`DB Stats` tab displays the database metrics for the
  selected database.

.. include:: /includes/fact-cluster-metrics.rst

|mms| retrieves database metrics every 20 minutes by default but
adjusts frequency when necessary to reduce the impact on database
performance. If the collection of database statistics still affects
performance, you can disable collection:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
   
   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-project-settings.rst

   .. step:: Disable the setting.

      Toggle :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics` to 
      :guilabel:`Off`.

The view for each tab has three distinct sections:

Chart Controls

|mms| provides the following controls for the :guilabel:`Status`,
