You can pause and resume archiving from the {+atlas-cli+},
{+atlas-ui+}, and |api|. When you pause, previously archived documents
continue to be available on the cloud object storage for querying, but
archiving activity for the collection on your |service| cluster is
stopped until you resume archiving. You will continue to incur costs for
storage on the cloud object storage and for reading data. When you
resume archiving, data that meets the criteria for archiving is archived
and archived data that meets the deletion age limit is deleted. 

|service| won't pause data expiration if you pause your
{+Online-Archive+} or |service| cluster. |service| will delete expired
data. 

You can pause an online archive and create another online archive for 
the same namespace. However, this second online archive cannot contain the same 
partition fields as the paused online archive. Additionally, only one online 
archive can be ``Active``. If you try to resume a paused online archive when 
another online archive for the same namespace is ``Active``, the resume 
operation fails. You must either delete or pause the ``Active`` online 
archive to resume archiving for the paused online archive.

Required Access
---------------

To update, pause, or resume an online archive, you must have
:authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` access or higher to the project.

Pausing and Resuming Through the API
------------------------------------

To pause an active online archive or resume a paused online 
archive through the |api|, send a ``PATCH`` request to the 
:oas-atlas-tag:`onlineArchives <Online-Archive>` endpoint with the 
unique ID of the online archive to pause or resume. To learn more about 
the syntax and options, see :oas-atlas-op:`API 
</updateOnlineArchive>`.
