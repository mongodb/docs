For example, US-ASCII characters are encoded using one byte. Characters
with diacritic markings and additional Latin alphabetical characters
(i.e. Latin characters outside of the English alphabet) are encoded
using two bytes. Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters typically
require three bytes, and other planes of unicode (emoji, mathematical
symbols, etc.) require four bytes.
