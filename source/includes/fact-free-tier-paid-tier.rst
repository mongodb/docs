|service| provides an option to deploy one Free Tier replica set per project.
Free Tier clusters use |service| ``M0`` instances and are an ideal development
sandbox, providing access to a subset of |service| features and functionality.
Paid clusters use |service| ``M10+`` instances and provide full access to
|service| features, configuration options, and operational capabilities. An
|service| :ref:`project <create-project>` can have multiple ``M10+`` MongoDB
clusters. 

The following table highlights key differences between an ``M0`` Free Tier
cluster and an ``M10+`` paid cluster. For a complete list of Free Tier
limitations, see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`. You can :doc:`upgrade
</scale-cluster>` an ``M0`` Free Tier cluster to an ``M10+`` paid cluster at
any time.
