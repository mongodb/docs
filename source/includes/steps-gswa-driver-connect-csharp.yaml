  The following sample application connects to your |service|
  cluster with your connection string and sends a ping to 
  confirm a successful connection. To test the sample application:
  
  a. Create a new directory called ``connect`` and 
     initialize your project by using the ``dotnet new`` command.

     .. code-block:: shell

        mkdir connect
        cd connect
        dotnet new console

  #. Run the following command to add the .NET/C# Driver to your project 
     as a dependency:

     .. code-block:: shell

        dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver
  
  #. Replace the contents of the ``Program.cs`` file with the following code.
     Make sure to replace the placeholder with your updated connection
     string:

     .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect.cs
        :language: csharp
        :linenos:
        :emphasize-lines: 7

  #. To run your application, use the following command:

     .. io-code-block::

        .. input::
           :language: bash

           dotnet run Program.cs
        
        .. output::
           :language: none
