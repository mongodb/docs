  a. Install the ``.deb`` package on each |application| and Backup
     Daemon host. Issue the following command, where  ``<version>`` is
     the version of the ``.deb`` package:

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo dpkg -i mongodb-mms_<version>_x86_64.deb

  b. When prompted whether to overwrite the currently installed version
     of ``mms.conf``, you should type ``Y`` to replace the existing file.

  c. If you :doc:`modified the ports </tutorial/manage-ports>` or the
     JVM settings that Ops Manager uses, you need to re-apply those
     changes to the ``mms.conf`` file after |onprem| is upgraded.

     .. include:: /includes/admonitions/warning/unredacted-secrets-from-mms-conf.rst

     The upgrade to |onprem| 4.1 and 4.2 removed the ``-d64`` flag from
     the ``JAVA_MMS_UI_OPTS`` parameter.
