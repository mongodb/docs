msgid "As chunks grow beyond the :ref:`specified chunk size <sharding-chunk-size>` a :program:`mongos` instance will attempt to split the chunk in half. Splits may lead to an uneven distribution of the chunks for a collection across the shards. In such cases, the :program:`mongos` instances will initiate a round of migrations to redistribute chunks across shards. See :doc:`/core/sharding-balancing` for more details on balancing chunks across shards."
