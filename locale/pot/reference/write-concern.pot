msgid ":term:`Write concern` describes the guarantee that MongoDB provides when reporting on the success of a write operation. The strength of the write concerns determine the level of guarantee. When inserts, updates and deletes have a *weak* write concern, write operations return quickly. In some failure cases, write operations issued with weak write concerns may not persist. With *stronger* write concerns, clients wait after sending a write operation for MongoDB to confirm the write operations."

msgid "MongoDB provides different levels of write concern to better address the specific needs of applications. Clients may adjust write concern to ensure that the most important operations persist successfully to an entire MongoDB deployment. For other less critical operations, clients can adjust the write concern to ensure faster performance rather than ensure persistence to the entire deployment."
