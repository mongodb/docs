Overview
--------

As part of normal operation, MongoDB maintains a running log of events,
including entries such as incoming connections, commands run, and issues
encountered. Generally, log messages are useful for diagnosing issues,
monitoring your deployment, and tuning performance. 

Structured Logging
------------------

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :binary:`~bin.mongod` / :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances output all log messages in :ref:`structured JSON format
<log-message-json-output-format>`. Log entries are written as a series
of key-value pairs, where each key indicates a log message field type,
such as "severity", and each corresponding value records the associated
logging information for that field type, such as "informational".
Previously, log entries were output as plaintext.

.. example::

   The following is an example log message in JSON format as it would
   appear in the MongoDB log file:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-01T15:16:17.180+00:00"},"s":"I", "c":"NETWORK", "id":12345, "ctx":"listener", "msg":"Listening on","attr":{"address":"127.0.0.1"}}

   JSON log entries can be :ref:`pretty-printed
   <log-message-pretty-printing>` for readability. Here is the same log
   entry pretty-printed:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      {
        "t": {
          "$date": "2020-05-01T15:16:17.180+00:00"
        },
        "s": "I",
        "c": "NETWORK",
        "id": 12345,
        "ctx": "listener",
        "msg": "Listening on",
        "attr": {
          "address": "127.0.0.1"
        }
      }

   In this log entry, for example, the key ``s``, representing
   :ref:`severity <log-severity-levels>`, has a corresponding value of
   ``I``, representing "Informational", and the key ``c``, representing
   :ref:`component <log-message-components>`, has a corresponding value
   of ``NETWORK``, indicating that the "network" component was
   responsible for this particular message. The various field types are
   presented in detail in the :ref:`log-message-field-types` section.

Structured logging with key-value pairs allows for efficient parsing
by automated tools or log ingestion services, and makes programmatic
search and analysis of log messages easier to perform. Examples of
analyzing structured log messages can be found in the
:ref:`log-message-parsing` section.

.. _log-message-json-output-format:

JSON Log Output Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With MongoDB 4.4, all log output is now in JSON format. This includes
log output sent to the *file*, *syslog*, and *stdout* (standard out)
:ref:`log destinations <log-message-destinations>`, as well as the
output of the :dbcommand:`getLog` command.

Each log entry is output as a self-contained JSON object which follows
the :doc:`Relaxed Extended JSON v2.0 </reference/mongodb-extended-json>`
specification, and has the following layout and field order:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
     "t": <Datetime>, // timestamp
     "s": <String>, // severity
     "c": <String>, // component
     "ctx": <String>, // context
     "id": <Integer>, // unique identifier
     "msg": <String>, // message body
     "attr": <Object> // additional attributes (optional)
     "tags": <Array of strings> // tags (optional)
     "truncated": <Object> // truncation info (if truncated)
     "size": <Integer> // original size of entry (if truncated)
   }

- **Timestamp** - Timestamp of the log message, in ``ISO-8601``
  format. See :ref:`log-message-timestamp`.

- **Severity** - String representing the short severity code of the log
  message. See :ref:`log-severity-levels`.

- **Component** - String representing the full component string of the
  log message. See :ref:`log-message-components`.

- **Context** - String representing the name of the thread issuing the
  log statement.

- **id** - Integer representing the unique identifier of the log
  statement. See :ref:`log-message-parsing-example-filter-id` for an
  example.

- **Message** - String representing the raw log output message as passed
  from the server or driver. This message is :ref:`escaped as needed
  <log-message-json-escaping>` according to the JSON specification.

- **Attributes** - *(optional)* Object containing one or more
  key-value pairs for any additional attributes provided. If a log
  message does not include any additional attributes, this object is
  omitted. Attribute values may be referenced by their key name in the
  *message* body, depending on the message. Like **message**, attributes
  are :ref:`escaped as needed <log-message-json-escaping>` according to
  the JSON specification.

- **Tags** - *(optional)* Array of strings representing any tags
  applicable to the log statement, for example: ``["startupWarnings"]``.

- **Truncated** - *(if truncated)* Object containing information
  regarding :ref:`log message truncation <log-message-truncation>`, if
  applicable. This object will only be present if the log entry contains
  at least one **attribute** that was truncated.

- **Size** - *(if truncated)* Integer representing the original size of
  a log entry if it has been :ref:`truncated <log-message-truncation>`.
  This field will only be present if the log entry contains
  at least one **attribute** that was truncated.

.. _log-message-json-escaping:

Escaping
````````

The **message** and **attributes** fields will escape control
characters as necessary according to the
:doc:`Relaxed Extended JSON v2.0 </reference/mongodb-extended-json>`
specification:

.. include:: /includes/fact-json-escape-sequences.rst

An example of message escaping is provided in the
:ref:`examples section <log-message-json-examples>`.

.. _log-message-truncation:

Truncation
``````````
Any **attributes** that exceed the maximum size defined with
:parameter:`maxLogSizeKB` (default: 10 KB) are truncated. Truncated
attributes omit log data beyond the configured limit, but retain the
JSON formatting of the entry to ensure that the entry remains parsable.

Here is an example of a log entry with a truncated attribute:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 10-12
   :copyable: false

   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-19T18:12:05.702+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"SHARDING", "id":22104,   "ctx":"conn33",
   "msg":"Received splitChunk request","attr":{"request":{"splitChunk":"config.system.sessions",
   "from":"production-shard1","keyPattern":{"_id":1},"epoch":{"$oid":"5ec42172996456771753a59e"},
   "shardVersion":[{"$timestamp":{"t":1,"i":0}},{"$oid":"5ec42172996456771753a59e"}],"min":{"_id":{"$minKey":1}},
   "max":{"_id":{"$maxKey":1}},"splitKeys":[{"_id":{"id":{"$uuid":"00400000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"}}},
   {"_id":{"id":{"$uuid":"00800000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"}}},

   ...
   
   {"_id":{"id":{"$uuid":"26c00000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"}}},{"_id":{}}]}},
   "truncated":{"request":{"splitKeys":{"155":{"_id":{"id":{"type":"binData","size":21}}}}}},
   "size":{"request":46328}}

In this case, the ``request`` attribute has been truncated and the
specific instance of its subfield ``_id`` that triggered truncation
(i.e. caused the attribute to overrun :parameter:`maxLogSizeKB`) is
printed without data as ``{"_id":{}}``. The remainder of the ``request``
attribute is then omitted.

Log entries containing one or more truncated attributes include a
``truncated`` object which provides the following information for each
truncated attribute in the log entry:

- the attribute that was truncated
- the specific subobject of that attribute that triggered truncation, if
  applicable.
- the data ``type`` of the truncated field
- the ``size`` of the truncated field

Log entries with truncated attributes may also include an additional
``size`` field at the end of the entry which indicates the original
size of the attribute before truncation, in this case ``46328`` or about
46KB. This final ``size`` field is only shown if it is different from
the ``size`` field in the ``truncated`` object, i.e. if the total object
size of the attribute is different from the size of the truncated
subobject, as is the case in the example above.

Padding
```````

When output to the *file* or the *syslog* log destinations, padding is
added after the **severity**, **context**, and **id** fields to increase
readability when viewed with a fixed-width font.

The following MongoDB log file excerpt demonstrates this padding:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:12.724+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"CONTROL",  "id":23285,   "ctx":"main","msg":"Automatically disabling TLS 1.0, to force-enable TLS 1.0 specify --sslDisabledProtocols 'none'"}
   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:12.734+00:00"},"s":"W",  "c":"ASIO",     "id":22601,   "ctx":"main","msg":"No TransportLayer configured during NetworkInterface startup"}
   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:12.734+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"NETWORK",  "id":4648601, "ctx":"main","msg":"Implicit TCP FastOpen unavailable. If TCP FastOpen is required, set tcpFastOpenServer, tcpFastOpenClient, and tcpFastOpenQueueSize."}
   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:12.814+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"STORAGE",  "id":4615611, "ctx":"initandlisten","msg":"MongoDB starting","attr":{"pid":10111,"port":27001,"dbPath":"/var/lib/mongo","architecture":"64-bit","host":"centos8"}}
   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:12.814+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"CONTROL",  "id":23403,   "ctx":"initandlisten","msg":"Build Info","attr":{"buildInfo":{"version":"4.4.0","gitVersion":"328c35e4b883540675fb4b626c53a08f74e43cf0","openSSLVersion":"OpenSSL 1.1.1c FIPS  28 May 2019","modules":[],"allocator":"tcmalloc","environment":{"distmod":"rhel80","distarch":"x86_64","target_arch":"x86_64"}}}}
   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:12.814+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"CONTROL",  "id":51765,   "ctx":"initandlisten","msg":"Operating System","attr":{"os":{"name":"CentOS Linux release 8.0.1905 (Core) ","version":"Kernel 4.18.0-80.11.2.el8_0.x86_64"}}}

.. _log-message-pretty-printing:

Pretty Printing
```````````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-use-jq-with-structured-logging.rst

You can use ``jq`` to pretty-print log entries as follows:

- Pretty-print the entire log file:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     cat mongod.log | jq

- Pretty-print the most recent log entry:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     cat mongod.log | tail -1 | jq

More examples of working with MongoDB structured logs are available in
the :ref:`log-message-parsing` section.

.. _log-message-destinations:

Configuring Log Message Destinations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB log messages can be output to *file*, *syslog*, or *stdout*
(standard output).

To configure the log output destination, use one of the following
settings, either in the :doc:`configuration file
</reference/configuration-options>` or on the command-line:

**Configuration file:**
  - The :setting:`systemLog.destination` option for *file* or *syslog*

**Command-line:**
  - the :option:`--logpath <mongod --logpath>` option for
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` for *file*
  - the :option:`--syslog <mongod --syslog>` option for
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` for *syslog*
  - the :option:`--logpath <mongos --logpath>` option for
    :binary:`~bin.mongos` for *file*
  - the :option:`--syslog <mongos --syslog>` option for
    :binary:`~bin.mongos` for *syslog*

Not specifying either *file* or *syslog* sends all logging output to
*stdout*.

For the full list of logging settings and options see:

**Configuration file:**
  - :ref:`systemLog options list <systemlog-options>`

**Command-line:**
  - :ref:`Log options list <mongod-log-options-section>` for
    :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  - :ref:`Log options list <mongos-log-options-section>` for
    :binary:`~bin.mongos`

.. note::

   Error messages sent to ``stderr`` (standard error), such as fatal
   errors during startup when not using the *file* or *syslog* log
   destinations, or messages having to do with misconfigured logging
   settings, are not affected by the log output destination setting, and
   are printed to ``stderr`` in plaintext format.

.. _log-message-field-types:

Log Message Field Types
-----------------------

.. _log-message-timestamp:

Timestamp
~~~~~~~~~

The timestamp field type indicates the precise date and time at which
the logged event occurred.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 2-4

   {
     "t": {
       "$date": "2020-05-01T15:16:17.180+00:00"
     },
     "s": "I",
     "c": "NETWORK",
     "id": 12345,
     "ctx": "listener",
     "msg": "Listening on",
     "attr": {
       "address": "127.0.0.1"
     }
   }

When logging to *file* or to *syslog* [#syslog-ts]_, the default
format for the timestamp is ``iso8601-local``. To modify the
timestamp format, use the :option:`--timeStampFormat <mongod
--timeStampFormat>` runtime option or the
:setting:`systemLog.timeStampFormat` setting.

See :ref:`log-message-parsing-example-filter-timestamp` for log parsing
examples that filter on the timestamp field.

.. note::

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the ``ctime`` timestamp format is no longer
   supported.

.. [#syslog-ts]

   If logging to *syslog*, the ``syslog`` daemon generates timestamps
   when it logs a message, not when MongoDB issues the message. This
   can lead to misleading timestamps for log entries, especially when
   the system is under heavy load.

.. _log-severity-levels:

Severity
~~~~~~~~

The severity field type indicates the severity level associated with the
logged event.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 5

   {
     "t": {
       "$date": "2020-05-01T15:16:17.180+00:00"
     },
     "s": "I",
     "c": "NETWORK",
     "id": 12345,
     "ctx": "listener",
     "msg": "Listening on",
     "attr": {
       "address": "127.0.0.1"
     }
   }

Severity levels range from "Fatal" (most severe) to "Debug" (least
severe):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Level
     - Description

   * - ``F``
     - Fatal

   * - ``E``
     - Error

   * - ``W``
     - Warning

   * - ``I``
     - Informational, for :ref:`verbosity level
       <log-messages-configure-verbosity>` ``0``

   * - ``D1`` - ``D5``
     - Debug, for :ref:`verbosity levels
       <log-messages-configure-verbosity>` > ``0``

       Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB indicates the specific
       :ref:`debug verbosity level <log-messages-configure-verbosity>`.
       For example, if verbosity level is 2, MongoDB indicates ``D2``.

       In previous versions, MongoDB log messages specified ``D``
       for all debug verbosity levels.

You can specify the verbosity level of various components to determine
the amount of **Informational** and **Debug** messages MongoDB outputs.
Severity categories above these levels are always shown. [#slow-oplogs]_
To set verbosity levels, see :ref:`log-messages-configure-verbosity`.

.. _log-message-components:

Components
~~~~~~~~~~

The component field type indicates the category a logged event is a
member of, such as **NETWORK** or **COMMAND**.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   {
     "t": {
       "$date": "2020-05-01T15:16:17.180+00:00"
     },
     "s": "I",
     "c": "NETWORK",
     "id": 12345,
     "ctx": "listener",
     "msg": "Listening on",
     "attr": {
       "address": "127.0.0.1"
     }
   }

Each component is individually configurable via its own
:ref:`verbosity filter <log-messages-configure-verbosity>`. The
available components are as follows:

.. data:: ACCESS

   Messages related to access control, such as authentication. To
   specify the log level for :data:`ACCESS` components, use the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.accessControl.verbosity` setting.

.. data:: COMMAND

   Messages related to :doc:`database commands </reference/command>`,
   such as :dbcommand:`count`. To specify the log level for
   :data:`COMMAND` components, use the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.command.verbosity` setting.

   Messages related to control activities, such as initialization. To
   specify the log level for :data:`CONTROL` components, use the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.control.verbosity` setting.

.. data:: ELECTION

   Messages related specifically to replica set elections. To specify
   the log level for :data:`ELECTION` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.election.verbosity`
   parameter.

   :data:`REPL` is the parent component of :data:`ELECTION`. If
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.election.verbosity` is
   unset, MongoDB uses the :data:`REPL` verbosity level for
   :data:`ELECTION` components.

.. data:: FTDC

   .. versionadded:: 3.2
   
   Messages related to the diagnostic data collection mechanism, such 
   as server statistics and status messages. To specify the log level
   for :data:`FTDC` components, use the 
   :setting:`systemLog.component.ftdc.verbosity` setting.

.. data:: GEO

   Messages related to the parsing of geospatial shapes, such as
   verifying the GeoJSON shapes. To specify the log level for
   :data:`GEO` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.geo.verbosity` parameter.

.. data:: INDEX

   Messages related to indexing operations, such as
   creating indexes. To specify the log level for
   :data:`INDEX` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.index.verbosity` parameter.

.. data:: INITSYNC

   Messages related to initial sync operation. To specify the log level
   for :data:`INITSYNC` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.initialSync.verbosity`
   parameter.

   :data:`REPL` is the parent component of :data:`INITSYNC`. If
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.initialSync.verbosity` is
   unset, MongoDB uses the :data:`REPL` verbosity level for
   :data:`INITSYNC` components.

.. data:: JOURNAL

   Messages related specifically to storage journaling activities. To
   specify the log level for :data:`JOURNAL` components, use the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.storage.journal.verbosity` setting.

   :data:`STORAGE` is the parent component of :data:`JOURNAL`. If
   :setting:`systemLog.component.storage.journal.verbosity` is
   unset, MongoDB uses the :data:`STORAGE` verbosity level for
   :data:`JOURNAL` components.

.. data:: NETWORK

   Messages related to network activities, such as accepting
   connections. To specify the log level for :data:`NETWORK`
   components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.network.verbosity` parameter.

.. data:: QUERY

   Messages related to queries, including query planner activities.
   To specify the log level for :data:`QUERY` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.query.verbosity` parameter.

.. data:: RECOVERY

   Messages related to storage recovery activities. To specify the log
   level for :data:`RECOVERY` components, use the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.storage.recovery.verbosity` setting.

   :data:`STORAGE` is the parent component of :data:`RECOVERY`. If
   :setting:`systemLog.component.storage.recovery.verbosity` is
   unset, MongoDB uses the :data:`STORAGE` verbosity level for
   :data:`RECOVERY` components.

.. data:: REPL

   Messages related to replica sets, such as initial sync, heartbeats,
   steady state replication, and rollback. [#slow-oplogs]_ To specify
   the log level for :data:`REPL` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.verbosity` parameter.

   :data:`REPL` is the parent component of the :data:`ELECTION`,
   :data:`INITSYNC`, :data:`REPL_HB`, and :data:`ROLLBACK` components.

.. data:: REPL_HB

   Messages related specifically to replica set heartbeats. To specify
   the log level for :data:`REPL_HB` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.heartbeats.verbosity`
   parameter.

   :data:`REPL` is the parent component of :data:`REPL_HB`. If
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.heartbeats.verbosity` is
   unset, MongoDB uses the :data:`REPL` verbosity level for
   :data:`REPL_HB` components.

.. data:: ROLLBACK

   Messages related to :ref:`rollback<replica-set-rollbacks>`
   operations. To specify the log level for :data:`ROLLBACK` components,
   set the :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.rollback.verbosity`
   parameter.

   :data:`REPL` is the parent component of :data:`ROLLBACK`. If
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.rollback.verbosity` is
   unset, MongoDB uses the :data:`REPL` verbosity level for
   :data:`ROLLBACK` components.

.. data:: SHARDING

   Messages related to sharding activities, such as the startup of
   the :binary:`~bin.mongos`. To specify the log level for
   :data:`SHARDING` components, use the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.sharding.verbosity` setting.

.. data:: STORAGE

   Messages related to storage activities, such as processes involved
   in the :dbcommand:`fsync` command. To specify the log level for
   :data:`STORAGE` components, use the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.storage.verbosity` setting.

   :data:`STORAGE` is the parent component of :data:`JOURNAL` and
   :data:`RECOVERY`.

.. data:: TXN

   .. versionadded:: 4.0.2

   Messages related to :doc:`multi-document transactions
   </core/transactions>`. To specify the log level for :data:`TXN`
   components, use the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.transaction.verbosity` setting.

.. data:: WRITE

   Messages related to write operations, such as :dbcommand:`update`
   commands. To specify the log level for :data:`WRITE` components,
   use the :setting:`systemLog.component.write.verbosity` setting.

.. data:: -

   Messages not associated with a named component. Unnamed components
   have the default log level specified in the
   :setting:`systemLog.verbosity` setting. The
   :setting:`systemLog.verbosity` setting is the default setting for
   both named and unnamed components.

See :ref:`log-message-parsing-example-filter-component` for log parsing
examples that filter on the component field.

.. _log-messages-client-data:

Client Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

`MongoDB drivers <https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/>`_ and
client applications (including :binary:`~bin.mongosh`) have the
ability to send identifying information at the time of connection to the
server. After the connection is established, the client does not send
the identifying information again unless the connection is dropped
and reestablished.

This identifying information is contained in the **attributes**
field of the log entry. The exact information included varies by client. 

Below is a sample log message containing the client data document as
transmitted from a :binary:`~bin.mongosh` connection. The client
data is contained in the ``doc`` object in the **attributes** field:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-20T16:21:31.561+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"NETWORK",  "id":51800,   "ctx":"conn202","msg":"client metadata","attr":{"remote":"127.0.0.1:37106","client":"conn202","doc":{"application":{"name":"MongoDB Shell"},"driver":{"name":"MongoDB Internal Client","version":"4.4.0"},"os":{"type":"Linux","name":"CentOS Linux release 8.0.1905 (Core) ","architecture":"x86_64","version":"Kernel 4.18.0-80.11.2.el8_0.x86_64"}}}}

When secondary members of a
:doc:`replica set </core/replica-set-members/>` initiate
a connection to a primary, they send similar data. A sample log message
containing this initiation connection might appear as follows. The
client data is contained in the ``doc`` object in the **attributes**
field:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-20T16:33:40.595+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"NETWORK",  "id":51800,   "ctx":"conn214","msg":"client metadata","attr":{"remote":"127.0.0.1:37176","client":"conn214","doc":{"driver":{"name":"NetworkInterfaceTL","version":"4.4.0"},"os":{"type":"Linux","name":"CentOS Linux release 8.0.1905 (Core) ","architecture":"x86_64","version":"Kernel 4.18.0-80.11.2.el8_0.x86_64"}}}}

See the :ref:`examples section <log-message-json-examples>` for a
:ref:`pretty-printed <log-message-pretty-printing>` example showing
client data.

.. _log-message-verbosity-levels:

Verbosity Levels
----------------

You can specify the logging verbosity level to increase or decrease
the the amount of log messages MongoDB outputs. Verbosity levels can be
adjusted for all components together, or for specific
:ref:`named components <log-message-components>` individually.

Verbosity affects log entries in the :ref:`severity
<log-severity-levels>` categories **Informational** and **Debug** only.
Severity categories above these levels are always shown.

You might set verbosity levels to a high value to show detailed logging
for debugging or development, or to a low value to minimize writes to
the log on a vetted production deployment. [#slow-oplogs]_

View Current Log Verbosity Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the current verbosity levels, use the
:method:`db.getLogComponents()` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getLogComponents()

Your output might resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
    "verbosity" : 0,
    "accessControl" : {
       "verbosity" : -1
    },
    "command" : {
       "verbosity" : -1
    },
    ...
    "storage" : {
       "verbosity" : -1,
       "recovery" : {
          "verbosity" : -1
       },
       "journal" : {
           "verbosity" : -1
       }
    },
    ...

The initial ``verbosity`` entry is the parent verbosity level for all
components, while the individual :ref:`named components
<log-message-components>` that follow, such as ``accessControl``,
indicate the specific verbosity level for that component, overriding the
global verbosity level for that particular component if set.

A value of ``-1``, indicates that the component inherits the verbosity
level of their parent, if they have one (as with ``recovery`` above,
inheriting from ``storage``), or the global verbosity level if they do
not (as with ``command``). Inheritance relationships for verbosity
levels are indicated in the :ref:`components section
<log-message-components>`.

.. _log-messages-configure-verbosity:

Configure Log Verbosity Levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the verbosity level using: the
:setting:`systemLog.verbosity` and
``systemLog.component.<name>.verbosity`` settings, the
:parameter:`logComponentVerbosity` parameter, or the
:method:`db.setLogLevel()` method. [#slow-oplogs]_

``systemLog`` Verbosity Settings
````````````````````````````````

To configure the default log level for all :ref:`components
<log-message-components>`, use the :setting:`systemLog.verbosity`
setting. To configure the level of specific components, use the
``systemLog.component.<name>.verbosity`` settings.

For example, the following configuration sets the
:setting:`systemLog.verbosity` to ``1``, the
:setting:`systemLog.component.query.verbosity` to ``2``, the
:setting:`systemLog.component.storage.verbosity` to ``2``, and the
:setting:`systemLog.component.storage.journal.verbosity` to ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   systemLog:
      verbosity: 1
      component:
         query:
            verbosity: 2
         storage:
            verbosity: 2
            journal:
               verbosity: 1

You would set these values in the :doc:`configuration file
</reference/configuration-options>` or on the command line for your
:binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

All components not specified explicitly in the configuration have a
verbosity level of ``-1``, indicating that they inherit the verbosity
level of their parent, if they have one, or the global verbosity level
(:setting:`systemLog.verbosity`) if they do not.

``logComponentVerbosity`` Parameter
```````````````````````````````````

To set the :parameter:`logComponentVerbosity` parameter, pass a
document with the verbosity settings to change.

For example, the following sets the :setting:`default verbosity level
<systemLog.verbosity>` to ``1``, the :setting:`query
<systemLog.component.query.verbosity>` to ``2``, the :setting:`storage
<systemLog.component.storage.verbosity>` to ``2``, and the
:setting:`storage.journal
<systemLog.component.storage.journal.verbosity>` to ``1``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( {
      setParameter: 1,
      logComponentVerbosity: {
         verbosity: 1,
         query: {
            verbosity: 2
         },
         storage: {
            verbosity: 2,
            journal: {
               verbosity: 1
            }
         }
      }
   } )

You would set these values from :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

``db.setLogLevel()``
````````````````````

Use the :method:`db.setLogLevel()` method to update a single component
log level. For a component, you can specify verbosity level of ``0`` to
``5``, or you can specify ``-1`` to inherit the verbosity of the
parent. For example, the following sets the
:setting:`systemLog.component.query.verbosity` to its parent verbosity
(i.e. default verbosity):

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.setLogLevel(-1, "query")

You would set this value from :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-slow-oplog-log-message-footnote.rst

.. _log-message-slow-ops:

Logging Slow Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Client operations (such as queries) appear in the log if their duration
exceeds the :ref:`slow operation threshold <slowms-threshold-option>` or
when the :ref:`log verbosity level <log-message-verbosity-levels>` is 1
or higher. [#slow-oplogs]_ These log entries include the full command
object associated with the operation.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-log-query-shapes-plan-cache-key.rst

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, :ref:`slow operation
<database-profiling-specify-slowms-threshold>` log messages include a 
``remote`` field specifying client IP address.

The following example output includes information about
a slow :doc:`aggregation </aggregation>` operation:

.. _log-message-parsing:

Parsing Structured Log Messages
-------------------------------

Log parsing is the act of programmatically searching through and
analyzing log files, often in an automated manner. With the introduction
of structured logging in MongoDB 4.4, log parsing is made simpler and
more powerful. For example:

- Log message fields are presented as key-value pairs. Log parsers can
  query by specific keys of interest to efficiently filter results.

- Log messages always contain the same message structure. Log parsers
  can reliably extract information from any log message, without needing
  to code for cases where information is missing or formatted
  differently.

The following examples demonstrate common log parsing workflows when
working with MongoDB JSON log output.

Log Parsing Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-use-jq-with-structured-logging.rst

These examples use ``jq`` to simplify log parsing.

Counting Unique Messages
````````````````````````

The following example shows the top 10 unique message values in a given
log file, sorted by frequency:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq -r ".msg" /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10

Monitoring Connections
``````````````````````
Remote client connections are shown in the log under the "remote" key
in the attribute object. The following counts all unique connections
over the course of the log file and presents them in descending order by
number of occurrences:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq -r '.attr.remote' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log | grep -v 'null' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r

Note that connections from the same IP address, but connecting over
different ports, are treated as different connections by this command.
You could limit output to consider IP addresses only, with the following
change:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq -r '.attr.remote' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log | grep -v 'null' | awk -F':' '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r

Analyzing Driver Connections
````````````````````````````

The following example counts all remote `MongoDB driver
<https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/>`__ connections, and
presents each driver type and version in descending order by number
of occurrences:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq -cr '.attr.doc.driver' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log | grep -v null | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn    

Analyzing Client Types
``````````````````````

The following example analyzes the reported :ref:`client data
<log-messages-client-data>` of remote `MongoDB driver
<https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/>`__
connections and client applications, including :binary:`~bin.mongosh`,
and prints a total for each unique operating system type that
connected, sorted by frequency:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq -r '.attr.doc.os.type' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log | grep -v null | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

The string "Darwin", as reported in this log field, represents a macOS
client.

Analyzing Slow Queries
``````````````````````

With :ref:`slow operation logging <log-message-slow-ops>` enabled, the
following returns only the slow operations that took above
2000 milliseconds:, for further analysis:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq '. | select(.attr.durationMillis>=2000)' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

Consult the `jq documentation <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/>`_
for more information on the ``jq`` filters shown in this example.

.. _log-message-parsing-example-filter-component:

Filtering by Component
``````````````````````

Log components (the third field in the :ref:`JSON log output format
<log-message-json-output-format>`) indicate the :ref:`general category
<log-message-components>` a given log message falls under. Filtering by
component is often a great starting place when parsing log messages for
relevant events.

The following example prints only the log messages of
:ref:`component <log-message-components>` type **REPL**:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq '. | select(.c=="REPL")' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

The following example prints all log messages *except* those of
:ref:`component <log-message-components>` type **REPL**:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq '. | select(.c!="REPL")' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

The following example print log messages of
:ref:`component <log-message-components>` type **REPL** *or*
**STORAGE**:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq '. | select( .c as $c | ["REPL", "STORAGE"] | index($c) )' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

Consult the `jq documentation <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/>`_
for more information on the ``jq`` filters shown in this example.

.. _log-message-parsing-example-filter-id:

Filtering by Known Log ID
`````````````````````````

Log IDs (the fifth field in the :ref:`JSON log output format
<log-message-json-output-format>`) map to specific log events, and can
be relied upon to remain stable over successive MongoDB releases.

As an example, you might be interested in the following two log events,
showing a client connection followed by a disconnection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {"t":{"$date":"2020-06-01T13:06:59.027-0500"},"s":"I", "c":"NETWORK", "id":22943,"ctx":"listener","msg":"connection accepted from {session_remote} #{session_id} ({connectionCount}{word} now open)","attr":{"session_remote":"127.0.0.1:61298","session_id":164,"connectionCount":11,"word":" connections"}}
   {"t":{"$date":"2020-06-01T13:07:03.490-0500"},"s":"I", "c":"NETWORK", "id":22944,"ctx":"conn157","msg":"end connection {remote} ({connectionCount}{word} now open)","attr":{"remote":"127.0.0.1:61298","connectionCount":10,"word":" connections"}}

The log IDs for these two entries are ``22943`` and ``22944``
respectively. You could then filter your log output to show only these
log IDs, effectively showing only client connection activity, using the
following ``jq`` syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq '. | select( .id as $id | [22943, 22944] | index($id) )' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

Consult the `jq documentation <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/>`_
for more information on the ``jq`` filters shown in this example.

.. _log-message-parsing-example-filter-timestamp:

Filtering by Date Range
```````````````````````

Log output can be further refined by filtering on the timestamp field,
limiting log entries returned to a specific date range. For example, 
the following returns all log entries that occurred on April 15th, 2020:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq '. | select(.t["$date"] >= "2020-04-15T00:00:00.000" and .t["$date"] <= "2020-04-15T23:59:59.999")' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

Note that this syntax includes the full timestamp, including
milliseconds but excluding the timezone offset. 

Filtering by date range can be combined with any of the examples above,
creating weekly reports or yearly summaries for example. The following
syntax expands the "Monitoring Connections" example from earlier to
limit results to the month of May, 2020:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq '. | select(.t["$date"] >= "2020-05-01T00:00:00.000" and .t["$date"] <= "2020-05-31T23:59:59.999" and .attr.remote)' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

Consult the `jq documentation <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/>`_
for more information on the ``jq`` filters shown in this example.

Log Ingestion Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Log ingestion services are third-party products that intake and
aggregate log files, usually from a distributed cluster of systems, and
provide ongoing analysis of that data in a central location.

The :ref:`JSON log format <log-message-json-output-format>`, introduced
with MongoDB 4.4, allows for more flexibility when working with log
ingestion and analysis services. Whereas plaintext logs generally
require some manner of transformation before being eligible for use
with these products, JSON files can often be consumed out of the box,
depending on the service. Further, JSON-formatted logs offer more
control when performing filtering for these services, as the
key-value structure offers the ability to specifically import only the
fields of interest, while omitting the rest.

Consult the documentation for your chosen third-party log ingestion
service for more information.
