  Selecting :guilabel:`M0` automatically locks the remaining 
  configuration options. If you cannot select the :guilabel:`M0`
  instance size, return to the previous step and select a
  :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region` that supports ``M0`` Free Tier
  clusters.

  Once |service| finishes creating your Free Tier cluster, click the
  :guilabel:`Connect` button for the cluster. From the :guilabel:`Connect`
  dialog, do the following:
    
  a. Check that the IP address of the client you want to connect from
     is included under :guilabel:`Check the IP Whitelist`. You can
     add your current IP address to the :ref:`security-ip-whitelist` by
     clicking :guilabel:`Add Current IP Address`.
     
     If you want to connect from a different machine, click 
     :guilabel:`Add Entry` and input the specific IP address for that machine.
     
  #. Select :guilabel:`Connect with the Mongo Shell`. 
  
     The :guilabel:`Connect` dialog displays operating system-specific
     instructions for downloading the :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell.
     Follow the instructions in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog to download and
     install the shell.
     
  #. Connect with the :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell by following the
     remaining instructions in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog. You will need
     the password for the administrative user you created when configuring the
     Free Tier cluster.
     
  #. Insert a document into the ``test.foo`` collection:
     
     .. class:: copyable-code
     .. code-block:: javascript
     
         db.getSiblingDB("test").getCollection("foo").insert( { "msg" : "My First Document" } )
  
  #. Find all documents in the ``test.foo`` collection:
    
     .. class:: copyable-code
     .. code-block:: javascript
     
        db.getSiblingDB("test").getCollection("foo").find()
  
  Once you have confirmed your cluster is available and accessible, continue
  to the following section.
