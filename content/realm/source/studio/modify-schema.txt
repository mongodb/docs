Overview
--------

Realm Studio gives you tools to make non-breaking changes to your schema. You 
can:

- :ref:`Add classes to the schema<realm-studio-add-class-to-schema>`
- :ref:`Add properties to classes<realm-studio-add-property-to-class>`

.. important::

   If you make changes to your schema in Realm Studio, you must migrate 
   the realm file when you use it in your client app.

After you make schema changes, you can :ref:`add values <realm-studio-modify-an-object>` 
to the new properties and classes from within Realm Studio. You can also
:ref:`create new objects <realm-studio-create-an-object>` based on your 
new classes and properties. This gives you a graphical user interface 
(GUI) tool to experiment with changes to your schema until you get the 
object model you need.

When you've completed your changes, you can :ref:`export your model 
definitions <realm-studio-export-model-definitions>` from Realm Studio. 
This gives you new class definitions in your language of choice, which 
you can drop into your code.

You can also :ref:`save an updated version of the realm file 
<realm-studio-save-data>` to use in your app. When you save a realm 
file with an updated schema, you must :ref:`perform a migration 
<realm-studio-perform-migration>` to use it in your app.

.. _realm-studio-add-class-to-schema:

Add a Class to the Schema
-------------------------

To add a new class to your schema:

- Press the :guilabel:`+` button next to the :guilabel:`Classes` header
  in the upper-left hand corner of the Realm Studio window
- Name your new class
- Designate a primary key (Optional)
- Press the :guilabel:`Add class` button

You'll now see a new class in the class list displayed in the left-hand
sidebar.

.. _realm-studio-add-property-to-class:

Add a Property to the Class
---------------------------

To add properties to a class:

- Select the class where you want to add properties in the left-hand sidebar
- Press the :guilabel:`+` button under the :guilabel:`Create {Class Name}`
  button in the upper-right hand corner of the Realm Studio window
- Name your new property
- Select a type for your new property from the drop-down selector
- Click the checkboxes to select :guilabel:`Make this a list of strings` 
  and :guilabel:`Optional: Allow a null value` if needed
- Press the :guilabel:`Add property` button

You'll see your new property displayed alongside the other class properties.

If you already have objects in your class, you can add values for this 
property by clicking into the property's field for each value. If this is
a new class with no objects, you can create new objects in the class.

.. _realm-studio-export-model-definitions:

Save Model Definitions
----------------------

After you've made changes to your schema, you can export your new schema 
as class definitions.

.. include:: /includes/realm-studio-export-class-definitions.rst 

This is a great tool to iterate on your schema. You can also export class 
definitions in multiple languages for cross-platform development.

.. _realm-studio-perform-migration:

Perform a Migration
-------------------

After you make changes to your schema, you can :ref:`add values to new 
properties <realm-studio-modify-an-object>` and even :ref:`create new 
objects <realm-studio-create-an-object>`. If you want to then use this 
updated realm file in your app, you can :ref:`save the data <realm-studio-save-data>`. 
Before you can use it in your client app, though, you'll need to perform 
a migration.

Realm requires you to increment the version monotonically when 
you change the schema. If you try to open a realm with an updated object 
schema without migrating, your client will throw an error.

For instructions on how to complete this migration, consult your SDK's 
migration guide.
