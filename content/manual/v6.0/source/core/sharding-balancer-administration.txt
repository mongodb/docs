The MongoDB balancer is a background process that monitors the amount of
data on each :term:`shard` for each sharded collection. When the amount 
of data for a sharded collection on a given shard reaches specific 
:ref:`migration thresholds <sharding-migration-thresholds>`, the balancer 
attempts to automatically migrate data between shards and reach an even 
amount of data per shard while respecting the :ref:`zones 
<zone-sharding>`. By default, the balancer process is always enabled. 

The balancing procedure for :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` 
is entirely transparent to the user and application layer, though there 
may be some performance impact while the procedure takes place.

The balancer runs on the primary of the config server replica set
(CSRS).

Balancer Internals
------------------

Range migrations carry some overhead in terms of bandwidth and
workload, both of which can impact database performance. 
The :term:`balancer` attempts to minimize the impact by:

- Restricting a shard to at most one migration at any given time.
  Specifically, a shard cannot participate in multiple data migrations
  at the same time. The balancer migrates ranges one at a time.

  MongoDB can perform parallel data migrations, but a shard can
  participate in at most one migration at a time. For a sharded cluster
  with *n* shards, MongoDB can perform at most *n/2* (rounded down)
  simultaneous migrations.

  See also :ref:`range-migration-queuing`.

- Starting a balancing round only when the **difference in the amount 
  of data** between the shard with the most data for a sharded collection 
  and the shard with the least data for that collection reaches the 
  :ref:`migration threshold <sharding-migration-thresholds>`.

You can disable the balancer temporarily for maintenance, but leaving
the balancer disabled for extended periods of time can degrade cluster
performance. For more information, see
:ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporally`.

You can also limit the window during which the balancer runs to prevent
it from impacting production traffic. See :ref:`Schedule the Balancing
Window <sharding-schedule-balancing-window>` for details.

.. note::

   The specification of the balancing window is relative to the local
   time zone of the primary of the config server replica set.

Adding and Removing Shards from the Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding a shard to a cluster creates an imbalance, since the new
shard has no data. While MongoDB begins migrating data to the new
shard immediately, it can take some time before the cluster balances. 
See the :ref:`Add Shards to a Cluster <sharding-procedure-add-shard>` 
tutorial for instructions on adding a shard to a cluster.

Removing a shard from a cluster creates a similar imbalance, since data
residing on that shard must be redistributed throughout the cluster. 
While MongoDB begins draining a removed shard immediately, it can take 
some time before the cluster balances. *Do not* shutdown the servers 
associated to the removed shard during this process. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-remove-shard-balance-order.rst

See the :ref:`Remove Shards from a Cluster 
<remove-shards-from-cluster-tutorial>` tutorial for instructions on 
safely removing a shard from a cluster.

.. _chunk-migration-procedure:
.. _range-migration-procedure:

Range Migration Procedure
-------------------------

All range migrations use the following procedure:

#. The balancer process sends the :dbcommand:`moveRange` command to
   the source shard.

#. The source starts the move when it receives an internal 
   :dbcommand:`moveRange` command. During the migration process, 
   operations to the range are sent to the source shard. The source 
   shard is responsible for incoming write operations for the range.

#. The destination shard builds any indexes required by the source
   that do not exist on the destination.

#. The destination shard begins requesting documents in the range and
   starts receiving copies of the data. See also
   :ref:`range-migration-replication`.

#. After receiving the final document in the range, the
   destination shard starts a synchronization process to ensure that it
   has the changes to the migrated documents that occurred during the
   migration.

#. When fully synchronized, the source shard connects to the
   :term:`config database` and updates the cluster metadata with the new
   location for the range.

#. After the source shard completes the update of the metadata,
   and once there are no open cursors on the range, the source shard
   deletes its copy of the documents.

   .. note::

      If the balancer needs to perform additional chunk migrations from
      the source shard, the balancer can start the next chunk migration
      without waiting for the current migration process to finish this
      deletion step. See :ref:`chunk-migration-queuing`.

.. _sharding-migration-thresholds:

Migration Thresholds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To minimize the impact of balancing on the cluster, the
:term:`balancer` only begins balancing after the distribution of
data for a sharded collection has reached certain thresholds. 

A collection is considered balanced if the difference in data between 
shards (for that collection) is less than three times the configured
:ref:`range size <tutorial-modifying-range-size>` for the collection.
For the default range size of ``128MB``, two shards must have a data 
size difference for a given collection of at least ``384MB`` for a 
migration to occur.

   :method:`sh.balancerCollectionStatus()`


.. _chunk-migration-queuing:
.. _range-migration-queuing:
.. _asynchronous-chunk-migration-cleanup:

Asynchronous Range Migration Cleanup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To migrate data from a shard, the balancer migrates the
data one range at a time. However, the balancer does not wait for the 
current migration's delete phase to complete before starting the next 
range migration. See :ref:`sharding-range-migration` for the range
migration process and the delete phase.

This queuing behavior allows shards to unload data more quickly in
cases of heavily imbalanced cluster, such as when performing initial
data loads without pre-splitting and when adding new shards.

This behavior also affects the :dbcommand:`moveRange` command, and
migration scripts that use the :dbcommand:`moveRange` command may
proceed more quickly.

In some cases, the delete phases may persist longer. Range migrations 
are enhanced to be more resilient in the event of a failover during the 
delete phase. Orphaned documents are cleaned up even if a replica set's 
primary crashes or restarts during this phase.

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/sharding/waitForDelete-warning.rst

For more information, see :ref:`wait-for-delete-setting`.

.. note::

   Range deletion is a resource intensive operation that can
   result in significant cache and I/O stress as the cluster
   deletes the documents.

   In cases where you plan to move a large amount of data, such
   as when adding shards to a cluster or during the initial
   distribution of a sharded collection across multiple shards,
   consider resharding the collection instead. Resharding
   operations don't require range cleanup, which makes them 
   much less stressful on the cluster.

   For more information, see :ref:`sharding-resharding`.

.. _chunk-migration-replication:
.. _range-migration-replication:

Range Migration and Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During range migration, the ``_secondaryThrottle`` value determines
when the migration proceeds with next document in the range.

In the :data:`config.settings` collection:

- If the ``_secondaryThrottle`` setting for the balancer is set to a
  :term:`write concern`, each document moved during range migration must receive
  the requested acknowledgment before proceeding with the next
  document.

- If the ``_secondaryThrottle`` setting is unset, the migration process
  does not wait for replication to a secondary and instead continues
  with the next document.

To update the ``_secondaryThrottle`` parameter for the balancer, see
:ref:`sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle` for an example.

Independent of any ``_secondaryThrottle`` setting, certain phases of
the range migration have the following replication policy:

- MongoDB briefly pauses all application reads and writes to the 
  collection being migrated to on the source shard before updating the
  config servers with the range location. MongoDB resumes application
  reads and writes after the update. The range move requires all writes 
  to be acknowledged by majority of the members of the replica set both 
  before and after committing the range move to config servers.

- When an outgoing migration finishes and cleanup occurs, all
  writes must be replicated to a majority of servers before further
  cleanup (from other outgoing migrations) or new incoming migrations
  can proceed.

To update the ``_secondaryThrottle`` setting in the
:data:`config.settings` collection, see
:ref:`sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle` for an example.

Maximum Number of Documents Per Range to Migrate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _range-deletion-performance-tuning:

Range Deletion Performance Tuning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can tune the performance impact of range deletions
with :parameter:`rangeDeleterBatchSize` and
:parameter:`rangeDeleterBatchDelayMS` parameters. For example:

- To limit the number of documents deleted per batch, you can set
  :parameter:`rangeDeleterBatchSize` to a small value such as ``32``.

- To add an additional delay between batch deletions, you can set
  :parameter:`rangeDeleterBatchDelayMS` above the current default of
  ``20`` milliseconds.

.. note::

   If there are ongoing read operations or open cursors on the
   collection targeted for deletes, range deletion processes may
   not proceed.

Change Streams and Orphan Documents

.. _sharding-shard-size:

Shard Size
----------

By default, MongoDB attempts to fill all available disk space with
data on every shard as the data set grows. To ensure that the cluster
always has the capacity to handle data growth, monitor disk
usage as well as other performance metrics.

See the :ref:`sharded-cluster-config-max-shard-size` tutorial for
instructions on setting the maximum size for a shard.
