|service| supports deploying {+clusters+} and {+serverless-instances+} onto
Amazon Web Services (AWS). |service| supports all |aws| regions 
other than some regions in China and US GovCloud.

|service| supports the following |aws| regions. While all of the 
following regions support {+dedicated-clusters+} (``M10+``), 
some regions don't support free and {+shared-clusters+} 
(``M0/M2/M5``) or {+serverless-instances+}. 
The |service| :doc:`API </api/>` uses the corresponding 
:guilabel:`Atlas Region`.

This page provides reference material related to |service| {+cluster+}
deployments on |aws|. The following options do not apply to {+serverless-instances+}.

.. _amazon-aws-configuration-options:

{+Cluster+} Configuration Options
----------------------------------

Each |service| {+cluster+} tier comes with a default set of resources. |service|
provides the following resource configuration options:

Custom Storage Size
   The size of the server root volume. |service| clusters deployed onto
   |aws| use general purpose |ssd|\s [#amazon-disk-docs]_.

   .. include:: /includes/note-ram-availability.rst

   The following cluster tiers are available:

   .. include:: /includes/list-tables/instance-types/aws.rst

   .. include:: /includes/cluster-settings/cluster-naming-conventions.rst

   .. include:: /includes/fact-multi-cloud-low-cpu.rst

   Workloads typically require less than ``2TB``.

Custom Storage Speed
   The input/output operations per second (IOPS) the system can perform.

   Each {+cluster+} has a default |iops| rate. You can also choose to
   provision your tier's |iops| rate to meet your particular needs.

   The selected {+cluster+} tier and custom storage size dictate the maximum
   |iops| for each storage speed.

Encrypted Storage Volumes
   Encrypts the root volume for data at rest inside the volume and all data
   moving between the volume and the {+cluster+}. |service| uses
   `Amazon EBS encryption
   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html>`_.

.. _amazon-aws-availability-zones:

Amazon Availability Zones
-------------------------

Each |aws| region includes a set number of
independent availability zones. Availability Zones consist of one or more
discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking and connectivity,
housed in separate facilities. For regions that have at least three
availability zones (3AZ), |service| deploys {+clusters+} across three availability
zones. For regions that only have two availability zones (2AZ), |service|
deploys {+clusters+} across two availability zones.

The |service| :doc:`Add New {+Cluster+} </tutorial/create-new-cluster>` form marks regions
that support at least three availability zones as :guilabel:`Recommended`, as
they provide higher availability.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-no-node-restriction-aws.rst

For more information on the number of availability zones in a
given region, see the Amazon documentation on `global infrastructure
<https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/>`_.

For more information on |aws| regions and
availability zones, see the Amazon documentation on `using regions and
availability zones
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-
zones.html>`_

Regions with at Least Three Availability Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| {+clusters+} deployed in regions with at least three availability zones
are split across three availability zones. For example, a three node replica
set {+cluster+} would have one node deployed onto each availability zone.

.. figure:: /images/amazon-aws-3az.svg
   :alt: A 3-node replica set deployed across a 3-availability zone AWS region.
   :figwidth: 500px

:abbr:`3AZ (Three Availability Zone)` {+clusters+} have higher availability
compared to :abbr:`2AZ (Two Availability Zone)` clusters. However, not all
regions support :abbr:`3AZ (Three Availability Zone)` {+clusters+}.

Regions with Only Two Availability Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| {+clusters+} deployed in regions with two availability zones are split
across the two availability zones. For example, a three node replica set
{+cluster+} would have two nodes deployed to one availability zone and the
remaining node deployed to the other availability zone.

.. figure:: /images/amazon-aws-2az.svg
   :alt: A 3-node replica set deployed across a 2-availability zone AWS region.
   :figwidth: 500px

:abbr:`2AZ (Two Availability Zone)` {+clusters+} have a higher chance of loss of
availability in the event of the loss of an availability zone than :abbr:`3AZ
(Three Availability Zone)` {+clusters+}. However, where latency or location are a
priority, a region that supports :abbr:`2AZ (Two Availability Zone)` {+clusters+}
may be preferred.
