We recommend following these best practices to ensure optimal
performance and a smooth user experience.

:ref:`mongodb-service-limitations`.

Atlas Cluster Configuration
---------------------------

Use a dedicated Atlas cluster
  Production Apps should use, at minimum, an ``M10`` dedicated cluster.
  Depending on your use case, you may need to upgrade to a higher tier
  for optimal performance.

  If you use a shared cluster, like an ``M0``, ``M2``, or ``M5``, you
  may experience performance issues due to limited resources and
  contention with other users. If you upgrade from a shared tier to a
  dedicated tier after you go to production, you will need to
  :ref:`terminate Device Sync <pause-or-terminate-sync>` and reset or
  re-install all client applications.

Atlas oplog
  Device Sync requires access to a :atlas:`time-based oplog 
  </reference/atlas-oplog>` for your synced cluster. All new Atlas clusters 
  provide this by default. For best results, keep 48 hours of oplog for 
  a cluster using Device Sync.

MongoDB version
  Use the latest version of MongoDB, if possible. Some Device Sync
  optimizations use new MongoDB version features and enhancements.

NVMe minimum MongoDB version
  If your cluster runs on hardware that uses :ref:`NVMe storage <nvme-storage>`, 
  it must use MongoDB version 6.0 or later for Device Sync production 
  applications.

Disable or manage built-in schema validation
  A schema in App Services is **not the same** as :ref:`MongoDB's
  built-in schema validation <schema-validation-overview>`. Device Sync
  may interact with your cluster in a way that is incompatible with a
  built-in schema.

  If you use schema validation on your cluster, you should either
  disable it in favor of App Services schemas or manage the two schema
  validation layers so that they're compatible. For more information,
  see :ref:`App Services Schema vs Built-In Schema Validation
  <schema-app-services-vs-built-in>`.

App Services Configuration
--------------------------

Deployment model and geographic regions
  Use a :ref:`local deployment model <local-deployment>` when building a
  Device Sync application. Configure your App and MongoDB data source
  to run within the same geographic region and cloud provider.

Define a client maximum offline time
  The App Services backend uses a history of changes to underlying
  data to synchronize clients. Configure a :ref:`client maximum offline time
  <client-maximum-offline-time>` to control the number of days of
  history stored by your App. Clients that have not synchronized in
  more than that number of days must perform a client reset the next
  time they connect to the backend.

Client Application Code
-----------------------

Define a client reset handler
  To recover from a serious error conditions where the client and server
  histories diverge, you should define a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>`
  handler when you open each synced realm with an SDK.

Data Model and Schema
---------------------

Avoid breaking changes
  Once you've enabled Sync, there are limitations on how you can modify your
  data model. Specifically, Sync does not support :ref:`breaking changes 
  <breaking-change-quick-reference>` to your object types such as changing 
  a given property's type. If you want to make a breaking change you 
  need to terminate and re-enable Sync with the updated data models.

App Services schema data consistency
  If you create or modify Device Sync documents using another tool, such as the
  `mongosh shell <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/>`__ or MongoDB Compass, 
  be sure the documents validate against the App Services Schema for the collection. 
  For more information, see :ref:`Unsynced Documents <unsynced-documents>`.

Performance Best Practices
---------------------------

Production load testing
  Measure performance and identify issues in a scaled-up production
  deployment with :ref:`sync-production-load-testing`.

Write transaction size
  When writing large amounts of data, consider using multiple small
  write transactions instead of a single larger transaction. Depending
  on your Atlas cluster version and configuration, write transactions
  greater than 16MB may be rejected by MongoDB and cause the sync
  operation to fail.
