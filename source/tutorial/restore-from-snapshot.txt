==============================
Restore from a Stored Snapshot
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

With |backup|, you can restore from a stored snapshot or
build a :doc:`custom snapshot
</tutorial/restore-from-point-in-time-snapshot>` reflecting a
different point in the last 24 hours. For all backups, restoring from
a stored snapshot is faster than restoring from a custom snapshot in the
last 24 hours.

By default, |backup| automatically takes and stores a snapshot every 6
hours. Snapshots remain available for restoration following the
:ref:`snapshot retention policy <snapshot-frequency-and-retention>`.

For replica sets, you will receive one ``.tar.gz`` file containing your data; for
sharded clusters, you will receive a series of ``.tar.gz`` files.
