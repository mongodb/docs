Overview
--------

.. note::

   The MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism is available for MongoDB
   deployments on MongoDB Atlas.

The ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism uses your Amazon Web Services
Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) credentials to authenticate your
user. To learn more about configuring MongoDB Atlas, see the
:atlas:`Set Up Passwordless Authentication with AWS IAM Roles </security/passwordless-authentication/#set-up-passwordless-authentication-with-aws-iam-roles>`
guide.

To instruct the driver to use this authentication mechanism, you can specify
``MONGODB-AWS`` as a parameter in the connection string or by using
the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method.

Code Placeholders 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code examples on this page use the following placeholders:

* ``awsKeyId`` - value of your AWS access key ID
* ``awsSecretKey`` - value of your AWS secret access key
* ``atlasUri`` - network address of your MongoDB Atlas deployment
* ``hostname`` - hostname of your MongoDB Atlas deployment
* ``port`` - port of your MongoDB Atlas deployment
* ``awsSessionToken`` - value of your AWS session token

.. _kotlin-mongodb-aws-sdk:

AWS SDK 
-------

You can use one of the AWS SDK for Java v1 or v2 to specify your credentials.
This method offers the following features:

- Multiple options for obtaining credentials
- Credential caching which helps your application avoid rate limiting
- Credential provider management for use with the `Elastic Kubernetes Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html>`__.

To use the AWS SDK for Java for ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication, you must
perform the following:

1. Specify the authentication mechanism
#. Add the SDK as a dependency to your project
#. Supply your credentials using one of the methods in the credential
   provider chain

To specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential``,
use the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method
and add the ``MongoCredential`` instance to your ``MongoClient`` as shown
in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/AuthTest.snippet.aws-credential.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 9

To specify the authentication mechanism in the connection string, add
it as a parameter as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/AuthTest.snippet.aws-connection-string.kt
   :language: kotlin

To add the AWS SDK as a dependency to your project, see the following
AWS documentation for the version you need:

- For the **AWS SDK for Java v2**, see the `Setting Up <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/setup.html>`__
  guide.
- For the **AWS SDK for Java v1**, see the `Getting Started <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/getting-started.html>`__
  guide.

.. note::

   For the AWS SDK for Java v2, the Java driver currently tests using the
   ``software.amazon.awssdk:auth:2.30.31`` dependency.

   For the AWS SDK for Java v1, the Java driver currently tests using the
   ``com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-core:1.12.782`` dependency.

To supply your credentials, see the following AWS documentation for the
version you need:

- To learn more about the **AWS SDK for Java v2** class the driver uses to
  get the credentials, see the `DefaultCredentialsProvider <https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/auth/credentials/DefaultCredentialsProvider.html>`__
  API documentation.

  Learn how to supply your credentials to this class from the
  `Use the default credential provider chain <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-chain>`__
  section.

- To learn more about the **AWS SDK for Java v1** class the driver uses to
  get the credentials, see the `DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html>`__
  API documentation.

  Learn how to supply your credentials to this class from the
  `Using the Default Credential Provider Chain <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default>`__
  section.

.. note::

   If you include both v1 and v2 of the AWS SDK for Java in your project,
   you must use the v2 methods to supply your credentials.

.. _kotlin-mongodb-aws-env-variables:

Specify Your Credentials in the Environment
-------------------------------------------

You can provide your AWS IAM credentials by instructing the driver to
use the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism and by setting the
appropriate environment variables.

To use the environment variables to supply your credentials, you must perform
the following:

1. Specify the authentication mechanism
#. Add the appropriate environment variables

You can specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential``
or on the connection string.

To specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential``,
use the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method and add the
``MongoCredential`` instance to your ``MongoClient`` as shown in the following
example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/AuthTest.snippet.aws-credential.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 9

To specify the authentication mechanism in the connection string, add it as a
parameter as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/AuthTest.snippet.aws-connection-string.kt
   :language: kotlin

The next examples show how to provide your credentials by setting environment
variables for the following types of authentication:

- Programmatic access keys
- ECS container credentials
- EC2 container credentials

The following example shows how you can set your **programmatic access keys**
in environment variables by using ``bash`` or a similar shell:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<awsKeyId>
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<awsSecretKey>
   export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<awsSessionToken>

Omit the line containing ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` if you don't need an AWS
session token for that role.

To authenticate by using **ECS container credentials**, set the ECS
endpoint relative URI in an environment variable by using ``bash`` or
a similar shell as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI=<your ECS endpoint>

To authenticate using **EC2 container credentials**, make sure none of the
aforementioned environment variables are set. The driver obtains the
credentials from the default IPv4 EC2 instance metadata endpoint.

.. _kotlin-mongodb-aws-mongoclient-configuration:

Specify Your Credentials in a MongoCredential
---------------------------------------------

You can supply your AWS IAM credentials to a ``MongoClient`` by using a
``MongoCredential`` instance. To construct the ``MongoCredential`` instance
for ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication,  use the `createAwsCredential() <{+core-api+}/MongoCredential.html#createAwsCredential(java.lang.String,char%5B%5D)>`__
factory method.

You can supply only programmatic access keys to the
``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` method. If you need to supply ECS
or EC2 container credentials, use the instructions in
:ref:`<kotlin-mongodb-aws-env-variables>` or :ref:`<kotlin-mongodb-aws-sdk>`.

To use the ``MongoCredential`` for ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication, you
must perform the following:

1. Specify the authentication mechanism
#. Supply the credentials

To specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential``,
use the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method
and add the ``MongoCredential`` instance to your ``MongoClient`` as shown
in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/AuthTest.snippet.aws-credential-mongo-cred.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 9

If you need to specify an AWS session token, pass it to the
`withMechanismProperty() <{+core-api+}/MongoCredential.html#withMechanismProperty(java.lang.String,T)>`__
method as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/AuthTest.snippet.aws-credential-session-token.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 2, 10

To refresh your credentials, you can declare a ``Supplier`` lambda expression
that returns new credentials as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/AuthTest.snippet.aws-refresh-credentials.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :emphasize-lines: 4-6, 9

If you must provide AWS IAM credentials in a connection string, you can add 
it to your ``MongoClientSettings`` by calling the `applyConnectionString() <{+core-api+}/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyConnectionString(com.mongodb.ConnectionString)>`__
method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/AuthTest.snippet.aws-connection-string-session-token.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :emphasize-lines: 2, 5
