# 921987e0f00e4ce09dde671be6b1ed91
msgid "A memory-mapped file is a file with data that the operating system places in memory by way of the ``mmap()`` system call. ``mmap()`` thus *maps* the file to a region of virtual memory. Memory-mapped files are the critical piece of the storage engine in MongoDB. By using memory mapped files MongoDB can treat the contents of its data files as if they were in memory. This provides MongoDB with an extremely fast and simple method for accessing and manipulating data."

A \"hard\" page fault refers to situations when MongoDB must access a disk to access the data. A \"soft\" page fault, by contrast, merely moves memory pages from one list to another, such as from an operating system file cache. In production, MongoDB will rarely encounter soft page faults."
