Authentication verifies the identity of a user. The process uses either
something you *have* or something you *know*. You *know* your password.
You *have* an app that gives you a one-time token. Multi-factor
authentication (MFA) uses both.

.. important::

   To use |mfa|, an :authrole:`Organization Owner` must enable it for
   their organization. All members of that organization must enable
   |mfa| for their accounts. Those members who haven't enabled |mfa|
   can't access the organization.

When enabling |mfa|, |service| requests two forms of identification:
your password and one of the following factors:

- Okta Verify Mobile App
- WebAuthn
- Google Authenticator
- Email
- SMS

You can set up one, some, or all of these methods. When |service|
requires |mfa|, it offers you the choice of which method to use.

.. warning::

   Enable a minimum of two methods. You can access your account if
   you lose access to one method.
