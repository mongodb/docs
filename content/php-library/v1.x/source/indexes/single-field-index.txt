Overview
--------

Single field indexes are indexes with a reference to a single field of a
document in a collection. These indexes improve single field query and
sort performance. They also support :manual:`TTL Indexes </core/index-ttl>`
that automatically remove documents from a collection after a certain
amount of time or at a specified clock time.

When creating a single-field index, you must specify the following
details:

- The field on which to create the index
- The sort order for the indexed values as either ascending or
  descending

.. note::

   The default ``_id_`` index is an example of a single-field index.
   This index is automatically created on the ``_id`` field when a new
   collection is created.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``movies`` collection in the
``sample_mflix`` database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets
</sample-data>`. To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and
load the sample datasets, see the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas
</getting-started>` guide.

Create Single-Field Index
-------------------------

Use the ``MongoDB\Collection::createIndex()`` method to create a single
field index. The following example creates an index in ascending order on the
``title`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.php
   :start-after: start-index-single
   :end-before: end-index-single
   :language: php
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

The following is an example of a query that is covered by the index
created in the preceding code example:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/indexes/indexes.php
      :start-after: start-index-single-query
      :end-before: end-index-single-query
      :language: php
      :dedent:
   
   .. output::
      :visible: false

      {"_id":...,"plot":"A musical comedy duo...",
      "genres":["Musical"],...,"title":"Sweethearts",...}
