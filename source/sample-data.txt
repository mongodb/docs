|service| provides sample data you can load into your |service|
{+database-deployments+}. You can use this data to quickly get started
experimenting with data in MongoDB and using tools such as the
:ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui>` and :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>`.

For a list of datasets in the sample and a description of each, see
:ref:`available-sample-datasets`. Each dataset page contains
information on the databases, collections, and indexes in the dataset.

You can also generate synthetic data that aligns to your real data's
schema. To learn more, see :ref:`synthetic-data`.

To import your own data, see :ref:`import-strategies`.

Load Sample Data
----------------

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To load sample data, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project.

.. include:: /includes/atlas-roles/org-owners-add-project.rst

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To utilize the sample data provided by |service|, you must create
an |service| {+database-deployment+} to load data into. To learn more, 
see :ref:`create-new-database-deployment`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

You can load sample data into your |service| {+database-deployment+} from the {+atlas-cli+} or the :ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui>`.

Select the appropriate tab based on how you would like to load
sample data:
  
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli
 
      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-sampleData-load.rst

      After you run the command to load sample data, you can use
      the following {+atlas-cli+} commands to monitor the status of the
      sample data load job:

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-sampleData-describe-and-watch.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      .. tabs::
        
         .. tab:: Clusters View
            :tabid: clusters-view

            To load sample data into your {+database-deployment+} from
            the :guilabel:`Clusters` view:
         
            .. include:: /includes/steps-load-sample-data-clusters.rst

         .. tab:: Collections View
            :tabid: collections-view

            .. important::
         
               You can load sample data through the
               :guilabel:`Collection View` only if you have 
               :guilabel:`Data Explorer` :ref:`enabled 
               <disable-data-explorer>` and you don't have 
               any data already in your collection.
         
               To load sample data into your {+database-deployment+} from the :guilabel:`Collections View`:
         
               .. include:: /includes/steps-load-sample-data-de.rst

Sample Data Namespaces
----------------------

When you load the sample data, |service| creates the following
namespaces on your {+database-deployment+}:

.. warning::

   If any of these namespaces already exist on your 
   {+database-deployment+} when you attempt to load the sample data, 
   the operation will fail and no sample data will be loaded into your 
   {+database-deployment+}.

.. list-table::

|service| Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`atlas-getting-started` tutorial walks through setting up
an |service| {+cluster+} and populating that {+cluster+} with sample 
data.

|fts| Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`fts-tutorial-ref`
  Create an |fts| index using data from the
  :ref:`sample_mflix <sample-mflix>` sample database and run queries 
  against the movies collection in the sample database.
