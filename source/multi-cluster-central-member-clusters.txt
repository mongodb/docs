MongoDB recommends that you identify one cluster to act as a **central cluster**.
The central cluster hosts the |k8s-op-short| and acts as the control plane
for the multi-cluster deployment. This central cluster can also host
replica set members. This documentation refers to other |k8s| clusters
that host replica set members as **member clusters**.

Communication between replica set members occurs over a service mesh,
which means that your database doesn't rely on the central cluster to function.
Note that if the central cluster fails, you can't use the |k8s-op-short|
to change your deployment until access to this cluster is restored or
until you redeploy the |k8s-op-short| to an available |k8s| cluster.

You can host your application on any |k8s| cluster in the service mesh.
Your application can be co-located on a member cluster with one of the
replica set nodes that you deployed using the |k8s-op-short|, or you can
host your application on a cluster that doesn't host replica set nodes
or the |k8s-op-short|.
