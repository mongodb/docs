Construct the Chart
-------------------

To discover which directors of films represented in this dataset have
won the most awards, use the ``directors`` and ``awards.wins`` database
fields in your chart. Additionally, you can see which genres the
award-winning films belong to stacking the ``genres`` field in the
columns. A :ref:`column chart <column-bar-chart-ref>` makes it easy to
sort and compare fields with numerical values, so it is a good choice
for this use case.
