Overview
--------

|mms| supports safe automatic MongoDB version upgrades and downgrades
of managed MongoDB deployments while maximizing the availability of
your deployment. |mms| can upgrade and downgrade :term:`sharded
clusters <sharded cluster>`, :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, and
:term:`standalone MongoDB instances <standalone>`.

:doc:`/tutorial/configure-available-mongodb-version` describes how
to choose which versions of MongoDB are available to |mms|.

If |mms| does not manage your deployment, you need to change the
version of MongoDB manually. The MongoDB Manual provides upgrade
tutorials with each :manual:`release </release-notes>`.

.. note::

   |mms| automatically deploys config servers as replica sets for all
   new sharded cluster deployments using MongoDB 3.2 or later.

Prerequisites
-------------

Remove Incompatible MongoDB Features when Downgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the MongoDB deployment has set its 
:guilabel:`Feature Compatibility Version` to the same release series 
as its :guilabel:`Version`, you must first downgrade the 
:manual:`featureCompatibilityVersion</reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>` 
of the instance manually.
