Updates to ``RealmObjects`` must occur within write transactions. For more 
information about write trasactions, see: :ref:`Write Transactions 
<flutter-write-transactions>`.

The SDK supports update and upsert operations. An **upsert** operation either 
inserts a new instance of an object or updates an existing object that meets 
certain criteria. For more information, refer to the **Upsert Objects**
section on this page.

You cannot update asymmetric objects. This is because asymmetric objects 
are special write-only objects that do not persist to the database. For 
information on how to use asymmetric objects in your application, refer to 
:ref:`flutter-stream-data-to-atlas`.

Update Objects
--------------

The examples on this page use two object types, ``Person`` and ``Team``.

Update Object Properties
''''''''''''''''''''''''

To modify an object's properties, update the properties in a write transaction 
block.

.. _flutter-upsert-objects:

Upsert Objects
''''''''''''''

To upsert an object, call :flutter-sdk:`Realm.add() <realm/Realm/add.html>`
with the optional ``update`` flag set to ``true`` inside a transaction block.
The operation inserts a new object with the given primary key
if an object with that primary key does not exist. If there's already an object
with that primary key, the operation updates the existing object for that 
primary key.
