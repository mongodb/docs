================================================================
Rolling Update of x.509 Cluster Certificates that Contain New DN
================================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb



Members of a replica set or a sharded cluster can use :ref:`x.509
certificates for membership authentication <internal-auth-x509>` to
identify each other as memers of the same deployment.

To identify each others as members of the same deployment, the
Organization attributes (``O``\'s), the Organizational Unit attributes
(``OU``\'s), and the Domain Components (``DC``\'s) from the
certificates must match.

In some situations, you may need to update the member certificates to
new certificates with the new Distinguished Name (``DN``), such as if
an organization changes its name. Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB
provides a new :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` parameter to
set an alternative ``DN`` to use in matching. Using this parameter, you
can perform a rolling update of the certificates to new certificates
with different ``DN``.

The following tutorial describes the process to update the
certificates for a replica set without downtime. 

Consider a replica set where each member's certificates
(:setting:`~net.tls.clusterFile` and
:setting:`~net.tls.certificateKeyFile`) with ``DN`` value that contains
``"OU=10gen Server,O=10gen"`` (additional attributes are not considered
as part of the comparison):

.. code-block:: yaml

   net.tls.mode: requireTLS
   net.tls.certificateKeyFile: "./mycerts/10gen-server1.pem"
   net.tls.CAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

   security.clusterAuthMode: x509
   net.tls.clusterFile:  "./mycerts/10gen-cluster1.pem"
   net.tls.clusterCAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

The following procedure updates the members' certificates
(:setting:`~net.tls.clusterFile` and
:setting:`~net.tls.certificateKeyFile`) to new certificates that have a
``DN`` value with ``"OU=MongoDB Server,O=MongoDB"``.

.. note::

   The following procedure assumes that the new x.509 certificates meet
   membership certificate all other requirements. For details, see
   :ref:`x509-member-certificate-requirements`

Procedure
---------

0. Optional. Set Override Parameter on Running Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The procedure requires that all members of the deployment be
restarted. As the settings will not take into consideration until
you restart all members, your instances may log messages until the
procedure completes.

To avoid these messages, you can set the override parameter on
running members.

Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell directly to each member of the
deployment and set the :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride`
parameter to the new certificate ``DN``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setParameter: 1, tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride: "OU=MongoDB Server,O=MongoDB" } )

1. Modify the Configuration of ALL Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify each member's configuration:

- Update :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile` to the new certificate.

- Update :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile` to the new certificate.

- Set :parameter:`tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride` parameter to the new
  certificate ``DN``.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   net.tls.mode: requireTLS
   net.tls.certificateKeyFile: "./mycerts/mongodb-server1.pem"
   net.tls.CAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

   security.clusterAuthMode: x509

   net.tls.clusterFile:  "./mycerts/mongodb-cluster1.pem"
   net.tls.clusterCAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

   setParameter:
      tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride: "OU=MongoDB Server,O=MongoDB"

The settings will not take into consideration until you restart each
member (see next step).

2. Restart Each Member
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have modified the configuration for all the members,
restart each secondary and then the primary.

**For each secondary member**, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the
member and:

a. Use the :method:`db.shutdownServer()` method to shut down the member:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use admin
      db.shutdownServer()

b. Restart the member. 

   Ensure the member has reached :replstate:`SECONDARY` state before
   restarting the next secondary.

**For the primary**, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the member and

a. Use :method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the member:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.stepDown()

#. Use the :method:`db.shutdownServer()` method to shut down the member:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use admin
      db.shutdownServer()

#. Restart the member.

3. Remove the ``tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride`` Setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once all the members have been restarted with the new certificate,
you can remove the ``tlsX509ClusterAuthDNOverride`` parameter from
the configuration.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   net.tls.mode: requireTLS
   net.tls.certificateKeyFile: "./mycerts/mongodb-server1.pem"
   net.tls.CAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

   security.clusterAuthMode: x509

   net.tls.clusterFile:  "./mycerts/mongodb-cluster1.pem"
   net.tls.clusterCAFile: "./mycerts/ca.pem"

The settings will not take into consideration until you restart each
member.
