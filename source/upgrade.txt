Overview
--------

This page describes the changes you must make to your application
when you upgrade to a new version of the {+driver-short+}.

Before you upgrade, perform the following actions:

- Ensure the new {+driver-short+} version is compatible with the {+mdb-server+} versions
  your application connects to and the C++ standard version your
  application compiles with. For version compatibility information, see the
  :ref:`{+driver-short+} Compatibility <cpp-compatibility>`
  page.
- Address any breaking changes between the driver version
  your application is using and your planned upgrade version in the
  :ref:`Breaking Changes <cpp-breaking-changes>` section.

.. tip::

   To ensure compatibility across {+mdb-server+} versions when
   upgrading driver versions, use the
   :ref:`{+stable-api+} <cpp-stable-api>`.

.. _cpp-breaking-changes:

Breaking Changes
----------------

.. note::

   The {+driver-short+} follows :wikipedia:`semantic versioning. <Software_versioning#Schemes>`
   The driver may break build system or package compatibility in any release.
   Patch releases may revert accidental API breaking changes.

   For more information, see :ref:`<cpp-api-abi-versioning>`.

A breaking change is a change of a convention or a behavior starting in a specific
version of the driver. This type of change may prevent your application from working
properly if not addressed before upgrading the driver.

The breaking changes in this section are categorized by the driver version that introduced
them. When upgrading driver versions, address all the breaking changes between the current
and upgrade versions.

.. example:: Upgrading from Version 3.0

  If you're upgrading the {+driver-short+} from version 3.0 to version 3.10,
  address all breaking changes listed for versions 3.1 to 3.10, if any.

.. _version-3.11-breaking-changes:

Version 3.11 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Drops support for {+mdb-server+} v3.6.
- Requires MongoDB C Driver v1.28.0 or later.
- Removes export of the following private member functions in the bsoncxx
  ABI:
   
  - ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::value::value(const uint8_t*, uint32_t, uint32_t, uint32_t)``
  - ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::view::_init(void*)``
  - ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::view::view(const uint8_t*, uint32_t, uint32_t, uint32_t)``
  - ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::view::view(void*)``

- Removes export of the following private member functions in the mongocxx
  ABI:
   
  - ``mongocxx::v_noabi::options::change_stream::as_bson()``
  - ``mongocxx::v_noabi::options::aggregate::append(bsoncxx::v_noabi::builder::basic::document&)``
  - ``mongocxx::v_noabi::options::index::storage_options()``
   
- Declare all exported functions symbols with ``__cdecl`` when compiled with
  MSVC. This is an ABI breaking change if you use an alternative
  default calling convention when building projects.

.. _version-3.10-breaking-changes:

Version 3.10 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This driver version introduces the following breaking changes:

- Drops support for ``find_package(libbsoncxx)`` and ``find_package(libmongocxx)``.
  Use ``find_package(bsoncxx)`` and ``find_package(mongocxx)``
  instead.
- Drops support for the ``LIBBSONCXX_*`` and ``LIBMONGOCXX_*`` CMake variables
  provided by the legacy CMake package config files. Use the ``mongo::bsoncxx_*`` and
  ``mongo::mongocxx_*`` CMake targets instead.
- Removes the experimental C++ standard library (``BSONCXX_POLY_USE_STD_EXPERIMENTAL``) as a
  polyfill option.

.. _version-3.9-breaking-changes:

Version 3.9 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This driver version introduces the following breaking changes:

- Removes support for exported targets from the CMake project build tree
- Drops support for macOS 10.14, macOS 10.15, and Ubuntu 14.04
- Requires MongoDB C Driver v1.25.0 or later
- Requires CMake v3.15 or later

Version 3.8 and Earlier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For driver versions 3.8 and earlier, see the
release notes and associated JIRA tickets for each release
on `GitHub. <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/releases>`__
