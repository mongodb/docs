Install |onprem| on Windows
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

This tutorial describes how to install the :ref:`mms-application-package`,
which monitors MongoDB deployments, and the optional :ref:`MMS Backup
Daemon <backup-daemon>`, which creates and stores deployment snapshots.
This tutorial installs to Windows servers.

Prerequisites
-------------

Prior to installation you must:

- Configure Windows servers that meet the :doc:`hardware and software
  requirements </core/requirements>`. Configure as many servers as needed for
  your deployment. For deployment diagrams, see :doc:`/core/deployments`.

- Deploy the dedicated MongoDB instances that store the
  :ref:`mms-application-database` and :ref:`mms-backup-blockstore-database`.
  Do not use MongoDB instances that store other data. Ensure that
  firewall rules allow access to the :doc:`ports </reference/on-prem>` the
  instances runs on. See :doc:`/tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances`.

- Optionally install an SMTP email server.

  .. todo:: The SMTP email server is optional, right?

Procedures
----------

You must have administrative access on the machines to which you install.

Next Steps
----------

To set up a replica set for a test environment, see
:doc:`/tutorial/test-new-deployment`. The tutorial populates the replica set
with test data, registers a user, and installs the Monitoring and Backup
Agents on a client machine in order to monitor the test replica set.

To download the Monitoring and Backup Agents to a client machine, see
:doc:`/user-guide`.
