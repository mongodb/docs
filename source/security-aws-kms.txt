You can configure your |service| project to use an |aws| `IAM role 
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html>`__ 
for accessing your |aws| KMS keys for encryption at rest. You can 
either use an existing role or create a new role when you enable 
encryption at rest for your project.

This page covers configuring customer key management on your |service| 
project for role-based access.

If you have not yet enabled encryption at rest for your new or existing 
|service| project, follow the :ref:`aws-kms-enable-project` procedure 
to enable encryption at rest for your |service| project. If you have an 
|service| project for which you have already enabled encryption at rest 
and configured credentials-based access to your encryption keys, follow 
the :ref:`aws-kms-switch-project` procedure to switch to role-based 
access to your encryption keys.

You must configure customer key management for the |service| project
before enabling it on clusters in that project.

Prerequisites
-------------

To enable customer-managed keys with |aws| |kms| for a MongoDB
project, you must:

.. include:: /includes/fact-aws-kms-prereqs.rst

.. _aws-kms-enable-project:

Enable Role-Based Access to Your Encryption Key for a Project
-------------------------------------------------------------

   .. tab:: API

.. _aws-kms-switch-project:

Switch to Role-Based Access to Your Encryption Key for a Project
----------------------------------------------------------------

.. important:: 

   If you switch your |service| project from credentials-based access 
   to role-based access to your encryption keys, you cannot undo the 
   role-based access configuration and revert to credentials-based 
   access for that project.

      To update your encryption key management with the public API, use
      the same steps outlined in the :ref:`above procedure
      <aws-kms-enable-project>`.

.. _aws-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest:

Enable Customer Key Management for an |service| Cluster
-------------------------------------------------------

After you :ref:`aws-kms-enable-project`, you must enable customer key
management for each |service| cluster that contains data that you want
to encrypt.

.. note::

   You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner <Project Owner>` role to
   enable customer key management for clusters in that project.

For new clusters, toggle the
:doc:`Manage your own encryption keys </cluster-config/encryption/>`
setting to :guilabel:`Yes` when you create the cluster. 

For existing clusters:
