title: "Configure the |k8s-op-short| in a new cluster."
level: 4
stepnum: 1
ref: recover-om-new-cluster
content: |

  Follow the instructions to :ref:`install the Kubernetes Operator 
  <install-k8s>` in a new |k8s| cluster.

  .. note:: 

     If you plan to re-use a member cluster, ensure that the 
     appropriate service account and role exist. These values can overlap
     and have different permissions between the central cluster and member
     cluster.

     To see the appropriate role required for the 
     |k8s-op-short|, refer to the :github:`sample in the public repository
     </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/blob/master/samples/multi-cluster-cli-gitops/resources/rbac/namespace_scoped_central_cluster.yaml>`.

title: "Retrieve the backed-up resources from the failed |onprem| resource."
level: 4
stepnum: 2
ref: recover-om-retrieve-backups
content: |

  Copy the |k8s-obj| specification for the failed |onprem| resource and
  retrieve the following resources, replacing the placeholder text with 
  your specific |onprem| resource name and namespace.

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 40 60
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Resource Type
       - Values

     * - Secrets
       - - ``<om-name>-db-om-password``
         - ``<om-name>-db-agent-password``
         - ``<om-name>-db-keyfile``
         - ``<om-name>-db-om-user-scram-credentials``
         - ``<om-namespace>-<om-name>-admin-key``
         - ``<om-name>-admin-secret``
         - ``<om-name>-gen-key``
         - |tls| certificate secrets (optional)

     * - ConfigMaps
       - - ``<om-name>-db-cluster-mapping``
         - ``<om-name>-db-member-spec``
         - Custom CA for |tls| certificates (optional)

     * - OpsManager
       - - ``<om-name>``

  Then, paste the specification that you copied into a new file and 
  configure the new resource by using the preceding values. To 
  learn more, see :ref:`deploy-om-container`.

title: "Re-apply the |onprem| resource to the new cluster."
level: 4
stepnum: 3
ref: recover-om-re-apply-resource
content: |

  Use the following command to apply the updated resource: 

  .. code-block:: sh

      kubectl apply \
        --context "$MDB_CENTRAL_CLUSTER_FULL_NAME" \
        --namespace "mongodb" 
         -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/master/samples/ops-manager/ops-manager-external.yaml

  To check the status of your |onprem| resource, use the following command:

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl get om -o yaml -w

  Once the central cluster reaches a ``Running`` state, you can 
  re-scale the Application Database to your desired 
  distribution of member clusters.

  At this point, the newly restored |k8s-op-short| should pick up management of
  the existing Application Database.
  
  - The :ref:`ConfigMap <create-k8s-project>` used to create the initial project.

  - The :ref:`secrets <create-k8s-credentials>` used in the previous |k8s-op-short| 
    instance.

  - The ``MongoDB`` or ``MongoDBMulticluster`` |k8s-custom-resource| at its last 
    available state on the source cluster, including any |k8s-annotations| 
    added by the |k8s-op-short| during its lifecycle.

  .. note::
  
     If the Application Database replica set has lost some nodes and is
     unable to form a voting majority, :ref:`forcibly reconfigure the replica set <recover-appdb-forced-reconfig>`.
     This adds new replica set nodes that will form a voting majority allowing
     the replica set to elect a primary.
