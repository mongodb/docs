title: "Run an |fts| facet query that groups the genre and year fields
       into buckets."
content: |

  a. Create a file named ``facet-query.go``. 
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the
     ``facet-query.go`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:
      
     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Uses the following searchMeta clauses to query the collection: 

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/fts-facet-constant-desc.rst 

     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.
        
     .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts-tutorial/facet/tutorial.go
        :language: go
        :linenos:
        :dedent:

  #. .. include:: /includes/fact-fts-driver-connection-string.rst
  #. Run the following command to query your collection: 
  
     .. code-block:: sh 

        go run facet-query.go

  When you run ``facet-query.go``, the program prints 
  the following documents to your terminal:

  .. code-block:: none 
     :copyable: false 
      
     [{count [{lowerBound 23026}]} 
       {facet [
         {genresFacet [
           {buckets [
             [{_id Drama} {count 13527}] 
             [{_id Comedy} {count 6922}] 
             [{_id Romance} {count 3615}] 
             [{_id Crime} {count 2649}] 
             [{_id Thriller} {count 2603}] 
             [{_id Action} {count 2505}] 
             [{_id Documentary} {count 2041}] 
             [{_id Adventure} {count 2016}] 
             [{_id Horror} {count 1662}] 
             [{_id Biography} {count 1373}]]}]} 
         {yearFacet [
           {buckets [
             [{_id 1910} {count 23}] 
             [{_id 1920} {count 89}] 
             [{_id 1930} {count 308}]]}]}]}]
