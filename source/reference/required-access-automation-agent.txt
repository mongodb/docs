If your MongoDB deployment enforces access control, the |mms|
Automation Agent must authenticate to MongoDB as a user with the proper
access.

If you use :ref:`Automation <automation>`, |mms| takes care of this for
you. If you do not use Automation, follow the instructions on this
page.

To authenticate, create a user with the appropriate roles in MongoDB.
The following tutorials include instructions and examples for creating
the MongoDB user:

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-automation-agent-for-cr`.

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-automation-agent-for-ldap`.

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-automation-agent-for-kerberos`.

MongoDB user roles are separate from |mms|
:doc:`user roles </reference/user-roles>` and are described in the
MongoDB manual beginning with the
:manual:`Authorization </core/authorization>` page.

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/considerations-agent-access-control.rst

.. important::

   The Automation Agent user must be defined consistently for all
   processes in your |mms| deployment.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. include:: /includes/prerequisites-create-user-for-agent.rst

.. _access-control-automation-agent-2.6:

To automate MongoDB instances, the automation agent must authenticate
to the database as a user with the following access:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Required Role
     - Database
   * - :authrole:`clusterAdmin`
     - ``admin``
   * - :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase`
     - ``admin``
   * - :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`
     - ``admin``
   * - :authrole:`dbAdminAnyDatabase`
     - ``admin``
   * - :authrole:`backup`
     - ``admin``
   * - :authrole:`restore`
     - ``admin``

Authentication Mechanisms
-------------------------

To authenticate, create the user in MongoDB with the appropriate
access. The authentication method that the MongoDB deployment uses
determines how to create the user as well as determine any additional
agent configuration:
