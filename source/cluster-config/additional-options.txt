You can configure the following :binary:`~bin.mongod` runtime options
on ``M10+`` paid tier clusters.

To view these settings, open the :guilabel:`More Configuration Options`
under :guilabel:`Additional Settings` in the cluster form.

.. _set-oplog-size:

Set Oplog Size
--------------

Modify the :term:`oplog` size of the cluster. For sharded
cluster deployments, this modifies the oplog size of each
shard in the cluster. This option corresponds to modifying
the :setting:`replication.oplogSizeMB <replication.oplogSizeMB>`
configuration file option for each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the
cluster.

Specify your desired :guilabel:`Oplog Size` in megabytes in the
input box.

You can check the oplog size by connecting to your cluster
via the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and authenticating as a user
with the :authrole:`Atlas admin` role. Run the
:method:`rs.printReplicationInfo() <rs.printReplicationInfo>`
method to view the current oplog size and time.

.. warning::

   Reducing the size of the oplog requires removing data from the
   oplog. |service| cannot access or restore any oplog
   entries removed as a result of oplog reduction. Consider the
   ramifications of this data loss before reducing the oplog.

Allow Server-Side JavaScript
----------------------------

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/changed-javascript-enabled-mongos.rst

Set Minimum TLS Protocol Version
--------------------------------

Sets the minimum TLS version the cluster accepts for incoming
connections. This option corresponds to configuring the
:setting:`net.ssl.disabledProtocols` configuration file option
for each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the cluster.

.. admonition:: TLS 1.0 Deprecation
   :class: note

   For users considering this option as a method for enabling the
   deprecated Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 protocol version, please read
   :ref:`faq-tls-1.0-deprecation` before proceeding. |service|
   deprecation of TLS 1.0 improves your security of data-in-transit
   and aligns with industry best practices. Enabling TLS 1.0 for any
   |service| cluster carries security risks. Consider enabling TLS
   1.0 only for as long as required to update your application stack
   to support TLS 1.1 or later.

Require Indexes for All Queries
-------------------------------

Enable or disable the execution of queries that require a collection
scan to return results. This option corresponds to modifying the
:parameter:`notablescan <param.notablescan>` parameter via the
:dbcommand:`setParameter` command for each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in
the cluster.

Considerations
--------------

|service| performs uses a rolling deployment process
to apply modifications to the :guilabel:`Oplog Size` and
:guilabel:`Minimum TLS Protocol Version` options. For sharded clusters,
this involves a rolling restart of all shards and the config
server replica set. To learn more about how |service| supports
high availability during maintenance operations, see
:ref:`high-availability`.
