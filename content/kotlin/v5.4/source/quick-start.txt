Introduction
------------

This guide shows you how to create an application that uses the **{+driver-short+}**
to connect to a **MongoDB Atlas cluster**. If you prefer to connect to
MongoDB by using a different driver or programming language, see the
:driver:`list of official MongoDB drivers <>`.

The {+driver-short+} lets you connect to and communicate with MongoDB clusters
from a Kotlin application.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your data
on MongoDB clusters. In this guide, you can learn how to get started with your
own free cluster.

.. tip::

   To view another example that demonstrates how to build an
   application in Kotlin that connects to MongoDB Atlas, see the
   :website:`Getting Started with the {+driver-long+}
   </developer/products/mongodb/getting-started-kotlin-driver/>`
   developer tutorial.

Set up Your Project
-------------------

Install Kotlin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure that your system has Kotlin installed and running on JDK 1.8 or later.
For more information on getting started with Kotlin/JVM development,
refer to `Get started with Kotlin/JVM <{+kotlin-docs+}/docs/jvm-get-started.html>`__
in the Kotlin language documentation.

Create the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide shows you how to add the MongoDB Kotlin driver dependencies
by using Gradle or Maven. We recommend that you use an integrated development
environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse IDE to configure
Gradle or Maven to build and run your project.

If you are not using an IDE, see the
`Creating New Gradle Builds
<https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/>`__ guide 
or the `Building Maven
<https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-building-maven.html>`__ guide
for more information on how to set up your project.

.. _kotlin-get-started-install-bom:

Add the Driver Bill of Materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sharedinclude:: dbx/jvm/bom.rst

   .. replacement:: gradle-filename

      ``build.gradle.kts``

.. _add-mongodb-dependency:

Add MongoDB as a Dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__ to manage your
packages, add the following entry to your ``build.gradle.kts``
dependencies list:

.. include:: /includes/kotlin-driver-coroutine-gradle-versioned.rst

If you are using `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ to manage your
packages, add the following entry to your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:

.. include:: /includes/kotlin-driver-coroutine-maven-versioned.rst

Because you installed the BOM, you can omit a version in the
{+driver-short+} dependency entry. The version you specify in the
BOM determines the dependency versions to install.

After you configure your dependencies, ensure that they are available to your
project by running the dependency manager and refreshing the
project in your IDE.

Add Serialization Library Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable the driver to convert between Kotlin objects and BSON, the
data format for documents in MongoDB, you must also add one or both of the
following serialization packages to your application:

- ``bson-kotlinx`` *(Recommended)*
- ``bson-kotlin``

If you are using Gradle to manage your packages, add one of the following
entries to your ``build.gradle.kts`` dependencies list: 

.. include:: /includes/serialization-libs-gradle-versioned.rst

If you are using Maven to manage your packages, add one of the following
entries to your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:

.. include:: /includes/serialization-libs-maven-versioned.rst

After you configure your dependencies, ensure that they are available to your
project by running the dependency manager and refreshing the
project in your IDE.

To learn more about these packages, see
:ref:`fundamentals-kotlin-serialization`.

Create a MongoDB Cluster
------------------------

After setting up your Kotlin project dependencies, create a MongoDB cluster
in which you can store and manage your data. Complete the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started?jmp=docs_driver_kotlin>` tutorial
to set up a new Atlas account, create and launch a free tier MongoDB cluster,
and load sample datasets.

After you complete the steps in the Get Started with Atlas tutorial, you
have a new MongoDB cluster deployed in Atlas, a new database user, and
sample data loaded into your cluster.

Connect to your Cluster
-----------------------

This step shows how to create and run an application that uses the
{+driver-short+} to connect to your MongoDB cluster and run a query on
the sample data.

First, you must specify how the driver connects to your MongoDB cluster
by including a *connection string* in your code. This string includes
information on the hostname or IP address and port of your cluster,
authentication mechanism, user credentials, and other connection
options.

If you are connecting to an instance or cluster that is not hosted on Atlas,
see the :ref:`Other Ways to Connect to MongoDB
<kotlin-other-ways-to-connect>` section of the Connection Guide for
instructions on how to format your connection string.

To retrieve your connection string for the cluster and user you created in
the previous step, log into your Atlas account and navigate to the
:guilabel:`Database` page under Deployment and click the
:guilabel:`Connect` button for your cluster, which is shown in the following
image:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas_connection_select_cluster.png
   :alt: Atlas Connection GUI cluster selection screen

Select the :guilabel:`Drivers` option for connection and select
:guilabel:`Kotlin` from the list of drivers and :guilabel:`4.10 or
later` from the version dropdown.

Next, click the :guilabel:`Copy` icon, which is highlighted in the
following image, to copy your *connection string* to
your clipboard:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas_connection_copy_string_kotlin.png
   :alt: Atlas Connection GUI connection string screen

Save your Atlas connection string in a safe location that you can access
for the next step.

Query Your MongoDB Cluster from Your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, create a file called ``QuickStartDataClassExample.kt`` in your
project.

Copy the following sample code into the file and replace the value of
the ``uri`` variable with your MongoDB Atlas connection string that you
saved in the preceding step. Replace the ``"<password>"`` placeholder of
your connection string with the password you set for your user that has
**atlasAdmin** permissions:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/QuickStartDataClassExample.snippet.quick-start-data-class.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :caption: QuickStartDataClassExample.kt

.. note::

   This example uses a Kotlin data class to model MongoDB data.

When you run the ``main`` function, the application prints the details
of a movie document that matches the query, as shown in the following output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Movie(
      title=Back to the Future,
      year=1985,
      cast=[Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover]
   )

.. tip:: Data Classes

   To learn more about using data classes to store and retrieve data,
   see the :ref:`fundamentals-data-classes` guide.

If you don't see any output or receive an error, check whether you
included the proper connection string in your application. Also, confirm
that you successfully loaded the sample dataset into your MongoDB Atlas cluster.

.. important:: Known connection issue when using TLS v1.3

   If you encounter the following error while connecting to your MongoDB
   instance, you must update your JDK to the latest patch release:

   .. code-block:: none
      :copyable: false

      javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: extension (5) should not be presented in certificate_request

   This exception is a known issue when using the TLS 1.3 protocol with
   specific versions of JDK, but this issue is fixed for the following
   JDK versions:

   - JDK 11.0.7
   - JDK 13.0.3
   - JDK 14.0.2

   To resolve this error, update your JDK to one of the preceding patch
   versions or a newer one.

After completing this step, you have a working application that uses
the {+driver-short+} to connect to your MongoDB cluster, run a query on the
sample data, and print out the result.

Working with the Document Class (Alternative)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preceding section demonstrates how to run a query on a sample
collection to retrieve data by using a Kotlin data class. This section
shows how to use the `Document <{+api-root+}/bson/org/bson/Document.html>`__ class 
to store and retrieve data from MongoDB.

In a new file called ``QuickStartDocumentExample.kt``, paste the following sample
code to run a query on your sample dataset in MongoDB Atlas. Replace the
value of the ``uri`` variable with your MongoDB Atlas connection string:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/QuickStartDocumentExample.snippet.quick-start-document.kt
   :caption: QuickStartDocumentExample.kt
   :language: kotlin

When you run the ``main`` function, the application prints the details
of a movie document that matches the query, as shown in the following output:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     _id: ...,
     plot: 'A young man is accidentally sent 30 years into the past...',
     genres: [ 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi' ],
     ...
     title: 'Back to the Future',
     ...
   }

If you don't see any output or receive an error, check whether you
included the proper connection string in your application. Also, confirm
that you successfully loaded the sample dataset into your MongoDB Atlas cluster.
