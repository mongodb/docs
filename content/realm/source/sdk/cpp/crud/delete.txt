.. _cpp-delete-realm-objects:

Delete Realm Objects
--------------------

Deleting Realm Objects must occur within write transactions. For
more information about write trasactions, see: :ref:`Write Transactions 
<cpp-write-transactions>`.

Delete an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete an object from a realm, pass the object to
:cpp-sdk:`Realm.remove() function <structrealm_1_1db.html>`
inside of a write transaction.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.delete-an-object.cpp
   :language: cpp

.. _cpp-delete-inverse-relationship:

Delete an Inverse Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can't delete an inverse relationship directly. Instead, an 
inverse relationship automatically updates by removing the relationship 
through the related object.

In this example, a ``Person`` has a to-one relationship to a ``Dog``,
and the ``Dog`` has an inverse relationship to ``Person``.
Setting the ``Person.dog`` relationship to ``nullptr`` removes the inverse
relationship from the ``Dog`` object.

   :language: cpp

Model
`````

This example uses the following model:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/relationships.snippet.define-inverse-relationship.cpp
   :language: cpp

.. _cpp-delete-map:

Delete Map Keys/Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a :cpp-sdk:`map key <structrealm_1_1managed_3_01std_1_1map_3_01std_1_1string_00_01T_01_4_00_01void_01_4.html>`, 
pass the key name to ``erase()``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.delete-map-value.cpp
   :language: cpp

.. _cpp-delete-set-values:

Delete Set Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete a :cpp-sdk:`set element 
<structrealm_1_1managed_3_01std_1_1set_3_01T_01_5_01_4_01_4.html>` 
with ``erase()``, or remove all elements from a set with ``clear()``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.delete-set.cpp
   :language: cpp
