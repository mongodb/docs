This task page shows you how to connect to your MongoDB deployment using
the {+intellij-full+}.

.. note:: MongoDB Atlas

   If you need to create a MongoDB host, consider using 
   `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__.
   Atlas is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service which requires no 
   installation, offers a free tier to get started, and provides a 
   copyable URI to easily connect the {+intellij-short+} to your 
   deployment.

Prerequisites
-------------

Ensure that an instance of MongoDB is running and the {+intellij-short+}
is installed.

Steps
-----

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Show the Database tab.

      To show the :guilabel:`Database` tab, click the Database Explorer 
      icon on the far-right menu bar of IntelliJ.
      
      .. image:: /images/connect/intellij-database-explorer.png 
         :alt: Click the Database Explorer icon.

   .. step:: Select MongoDB as the data source.

      Click the :guilabel:`+` icon, then click :guilabel:`Data Source`
      and select :guilabel:`MongoDB` from the drop-down menu.

      .. image:: /images/connect/intellij-select-data-source.png
         :alt: Click the + button > Data Source > MongoDB.

   .. step:: Enter your connection string.

      Paste your :manual:`connection string 
      </reference/connection-string/>` directly in the 
      :guilabel:`URL` field near the bottom of the 
      :guilabel:`Data Sources and Drivers` tab.
      
      Ensure that your connection string specifies the port that your
      instance is running on. 
      
      Click OK.

   .. step:: (*Optional*) Select databases to load.

      You should see the connected MongoDB data source in Database 
      Explorer. 

      You can load as many databases as youâ€™d like by clicking on 
      ``1 of 11`` text as shown below:

      .. image:: /images/connect/intellij-select-databases-to-load.png
         :alt: Select the databases to load.

   .. step:: Select a data source using the Connections Toolbar.

      The Connections Toolbar is a feature of the {+intellij-full+} that 
      allows you to select a data source associated with your application
      from within the editor window.
      
      When you open a file that contains MongoDB code, a toolbar appears at 
      the top of the file as shown in the image below.
      
      .. image:: /images/connect/intellij-connections-toolbar.png
         :alt: The Connections Toolbar appears at the top of the file.
      
      This toolbar has a drop-down that allows you to select a data source 
      associated with your application. 
      
      For the best experience, the data source you select should 
      contain the following:
      
      - All of the databases, collection, and fields your application code 
        uses.
      - All of the indexes used by your queries. 

   .. step:: (*Optional*) Launch Playgrounds.

      To launch the Playgrounds, click the highlighted button in 
      Database Explorer.
