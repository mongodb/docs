==================================
Remove the Backup Agent from |mms|
==================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

|mms| displays active Backup Agents on the :guilabel:`Agents` page in in the
:guilabel:`Administration` tab. The page displays agents that have been active
in the last 24 hours. If an agent fails to report to |mms| for more than 24
hours, |mms| removes the agent from the :guilabel:`Agents` page.

To remove a Backup Agent **from |mms|**, :ref:`stop the agent
<stop-backup-agent>` and then wait 24 hours.

To delete the Backup Agent **from a Linux or OSX server**, :ref:`stop the
agent <stop-backup-agent>` and then remove the ``mongodb-mms-backup-agent``
file from the ``/usr/bin`` directory. If you installed the agent using a
``tar.gz`` file, the agent will be in the directory you chose during
installation.

To delete the Backup Agent **from a Windows server**, :ref:`stop the agent
<stop-backup-agent-windows>` and then use the Windows program uninstaller to
remove the ``MMS Backup Agent`` program.
