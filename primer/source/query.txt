Query MongoDB for Data
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Queries are requests sent from a client to a MongoDB instance that
return data. In response to a query, MongoDB returns results in the
form of a :term:`cursor`, which is an iterable object that yields
documents.

All queries in MongoDB have the scope of a :term:`collection` and
consist of 0 or more query conditions. These conditions limit the
result set to matching documents. Consider the following diagram of the
query process:

.. include:: /images/crud-query-stages.rst

The :method:`~db.collection.find()` method is the primary way that
clients issue queries.

Considerations
--------------

The ``_id`` values in your queries will differ from the examples in
these documents.

Prerequisite
------------

The examples in this section query the ``orders`` collection in the
``test`` database.

Additional Information
----------------------

See the :manual:`Cursor methods </reference/method/js-cursor>` that
allow you to modify a cursor to limit the size of the result set or to
return sorted results. Also consider the reference on the
:manual:`Query and Projection Operators </reference/operator/query>`
that MongoDB provides.
