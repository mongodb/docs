Manage Email/Password Users - C++ SDK

When you enable the :ref:`email/password provider <email-password-authentication>` 
in your Atlas App Services App, you can handle user authentication from client code
by registering and logging in new user.

.. _cpp-register-email-password-user:

Register a New User
-------------------

You can register a new user by calling the :cpp-sdk:`App.register_user() <classrealm_1_1App.html>`
member function with the desired username and password.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/authentication.snippet.register-user.cpp
   :language: cpp

The C++ SDK does not yet support user confirmation or password reset, so you
must configure the email/password provider to :ref:`automatically confirm users 
<auth-automatically-confirm-users>`. We do not recommend automatically confirming
users in a production environment.

.. _cpp-authenticate-user:

Log In or Log Out a User
------------------------

After you register a user, it is a separate step to log the user in.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/authentication.snippet.log-user-in.cpp
   :language: cpp

You can log out an authenticated user.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/authentication.snippet.log-user-out.cpp
   :language: cpp
