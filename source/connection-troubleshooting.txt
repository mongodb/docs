This page offers potential solutions to issues you might see when
connecting to a MongoDB instance or replica set while using the
{+driver-long+}.

.. note::

   This page lists only connection issues. If you are having any other issues
   with MongoDB, consider the following resources:

   - The :ref:`Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) <kotlin-faq>` for the {+driver-short+}
   - The :ref:`Issues & Help <kotlin-issues-and-help>` topic for information about
     reporting bugs, contributing to the driver, and additional resources
   - The `MongoDB Community Forums <https://community.mongodb.com>`__ for
     questions, discussions, or general technical support

Connection Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following error message is a general message indicating that the driver
cannot connect to a server on the specified hostname or port:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017

If you receive this error, try the following methods to resolve the issue.

.. _kotlin-connection-string-port:

Check Connection String
-----------------------

Verify that the hostname and port number in the connection string are both
accurate. In the sample error message, the hostname is ``127.0.0.1`` and the
port is ``27017``. The default port value for a MongoDB instance is
``27017``, but you can configure MongoDB to communicate on another port.

.. _kotlin-connection-firewall:

Configure Firewall
------------------

Assuming that your MongoDB deployment uses the default port, verify that your
firewall has port ``27017`` open. If your deployment is using a different port,
verify that port is open in your firewall.

.. important::

   Do not open ports in your firewall unless you are sure that is the port used
   by your MongoDB instance.

Authentication Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+driver-short+} can fail to connect to a MongoDB instance if
the authorization is not configured correctly. This often results in an error
message similar to the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Command failed with error 18 (AuthenticationFailed): 'Authentication failed.' on server localhost:27017.

If you receive this error, try the following methods to resolve the issue.

.. _kotlin-connection-string-auth:

Check Connection String
-----------------------

An invalid connection string is the most common cause of authentication
issues when attempting to connect to MongoDB.

.. note::

   For more information about using connection strings with the {+driver-short+},
   see :ref:`Connection URI <connection-uri>` in the Connection Guide.

If your connection string contains a username and password, ensure that they
are in the correct format.

.. note::

   If the username or password includes any of the following characters, they
   must be `percent encoded <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1>`__:

   .. code-block:: none

      : / ? # [ ] @


If your MongoDB deployment is on MongoDB Atlas, you can check your connection
string by using the :ref:`Atlas Connection Example <connect-atlas-kotlin-driver>`.
Make sure to replace the connection string in the example with yours.

When connecting to a replica set, you should include all of the hosts
in the replica set in your connection string. Separate each of the hosts
in the connection string with a comma. This enables the driver to establish a
connection if one of the hosts is unreachable.

.. _kotlin-connection-admin:

Verify User Is in Authentication Database
-----------------------------------------

To successfully authenticate a connection by using a username and password,
the username must be defined in the authentication database. The default
authentication database is the ``admin`` database. To use a different database
for authentication, specify the ``authSource`` in the connection string. The
following example instructs the driver to use ``users`` as the authentication
database:

.. code-block:: kotlin
   :copyable: false

   val mongoClient =
   MongoClient.create("mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>/?authSource=users")
   
.. _kotlin-error-sending-message:

Error Sending Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you send a request through the driver and it is unable to send the command,
it often displays the following general error message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   com.mongodb.MongoSocketWriteException: Exception sending message

If you receive this error, try the following methods to resolve the issue.

Check Connection String
-----------------------

Verify that the connection string in
your app is accurate. This is described under :ref:`Connection Error <kotlin-connection-string-port>`
and :ref:`Authentication Error <kotlin-connection-string-auth>`.

Verify User Is in Authentication Database
-----------------------------------------

The user needs to be recognized in your
authentication database. This is described under :ref:`Authentication
Error <kotlin-connection-admin>`.

Configure Firewall
------------------

The firewall needs to have an open port for communicating with the MongoDB
instance. This is described under :ref:`Connection Error <kotlin-connection-firewall>`.

.. _kotlin-connection-number-connections:

Check the Number of Connections
-------------------------------

Each ``MongoClient`` instance supports a maximum number of concurrent open
connections in its connection pool. The configuration parameter ``maxPoolSize``
defines this value and is set to ``100`` by default. If there are already a
number of open connections equal to ``maxPoolSize``, the server waits until
a connection becomes available. If this wait time exceeds the ``maxIdleTimeMS``
value, the driver responds with an error.

Timeout Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes when you send messages through the driver to the server, the messages
take a while to respond. When this happens, you might receive an error message
similar to one of the following error messages:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Timed out after 30000 ms while waiting for a server that matches ReadPreferenceServerSelector{readPreference=primary}.

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   No server chosen by ReadPreferenceServerSelector{readPreference=primary} from cluster description

If you receive one of these errors, try the following methods to resolve the
issue.

Set ``maxConnectionTimeoutMS``
------------------------------

The ``maxConnectionTimeoutMS`` option indicates the amount of time the
{+driver-short+} waits for a connection before timing out. The default
value is ``10000``. You can increase this value or set it to ``0`` if
you want the driver to never timeout.

Set ``maxConnectionLifeTime`` and ``maxConnectionIdleTime``
-----------------------------------------------------------

Consider setting ``maxConnectionLifeTime`` and
``maxConnectionIdleTime``. These parameters configure how long a connection
can be maintained with a MongoDB instance. For more information about these
parameters, see :ref:`Connection Pool Settings <mcs-connectionpool-settings>`.

Check the Number of Connections
-------------------------------

You might have too many open connections. The solution to this is described
under :ref:`Error Sending Message <kotlin-error-sending-message>`.

Additional Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While not related to a specific error message, this section includes
additional information that can be useful when attempting to troubleshoot
connection issues.

Get Log Information for TLS/SSL
-------------------------------

When using TLS/SSL, you can use the ``-Djavax.net.debug=all`` system property
to view additional log statements. This can help when attempting to debug any
connection issues. See `the Oracle guide to debugging TLS/SSL connections
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/ReadDebug.html>`__
for more information.
