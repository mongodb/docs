stepnum: 1
ref: install-bi-server
level: 4
pre: |
  Download the Business Intelligence Connector for your version of Red Hat
  Enterprise Linux or CentOS from the
  `MongoDB Download Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center>`_.

  You can check your operating system version with the following command:

  .. code-block:: sh

     cat /etc/redhat-release

  Extract the tarball you downloaded, and install the containing RPM packages:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    sudo yum install *.rpm

stepnum: 2
ref: create-users
level: 4
pre: |
  Replace ``biuser`` in the following command with your desired Business
  Intelligence username, and fill in the :ref:`connection string <mongodb-uri>`
  that points to your MongoDB instance.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
     mongobiuser create biuser mongodb://your.mongodbhost.com:27017/db1

  :program:`mongobiuser` will prompt you to set a password for ``biuser`` by
  default.

title: Generate your schema definition file.
stepnum: 3
ref: generate-schema
level: 4
pre: |
  Provide a MongoDB server hostname, replace ``dbname`` with the name of your
  database, and optionally replace ``collname`` with the name of a collection.
  If you do not specify a collection, :program:`mongodrdl` will generate a
  schema from all collections in ``dbname``.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongodrdl --host your.mongohost.com -d dbname [-c collname] -o schema.drdl
post: |
  You can examine the generated ``schema.drdl`` file, and remove any fields or
  tables that are not part of your intended schema.

title: Load the generated schema into the Business Intelligence Connector.
stepnum: 4
ref: load-schema
level: 4
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongobischema import biuser schema.drdl
