|service| lets you export your {+Cloud-Backup+} snapshots to an object
storage service.

To learn how to manage automated backup policies and schedules, see
:ref:`configure-backup-policy`.

.. _snapshot-export-supported-storage:

Supported Storage Services
--------------------------

|service| currently supports the following object
storage services:

- |aws| |s3| buckets
- {+az-bs+}
- {+gcs+} buckets

Additionally, {+service+} supports exporting snapshots to {+aws+} |s3|
buckets using PrivateLink.

How |service| Exports Snapshots 
-------------------------------

.. note::

   If you export backups to |aws| |s3|, you can enable 
   `AWS S3 Object Lock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-configure.html>`__ 
   to ensure the immutability of your backup files required 
   for compliance and security. Object locks prevent deletions 
   and modifications of exported backup files.

You can manually export individual snapshots or set up an export 
policy for automatic export of your snapshots. For automatic exports, 
you must specify a frequency in your export policy: 

- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Yearly

|service| automatically exports any backup snapshot with the
frequency type that matches the export frequency. The exported result 
is a full backup of that snapshot.

.. example::

   Consider the following: 

   - A backup policy that sets a weekly and monthly snapshot schedule 
   - An export policy that sets a monthly export frequency

   Suppose, at the end of the month, the weekly and monthly snapshots 
   happen on the same day. There would be ``4`` snapshots of which 
   ``3`` would be weekly snapshots and the fourth snapshot, although 
   treated as a weekly snapshot by |service|, would also be the monthly 
   snapshot because it happened on the same day. |service| will export 
   the monthly snapshot only because the export frequency matches the 
   snapshot frequency for that snapshot. To export the weekly snapshots 
   as well, update the export policy to export weekly snapshots also. 
   If the export frequency is set to weekly, |service| would export all 
   ``4`` snapshots.

As the export progresses, you may see partial results in your object
storage service.

|service| persists documents in snapshots irrespective of
:manual:`Time to Live </tutorial/expire-data>` settings. You can access these
documents from your snapshot past their Time to Live deadline.

To learn about snapshot export pricing, see :ref:`Snapshot Export Costs
<snapshot-export-costs>`.

Files |service| Uploads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| uploads an empty file to ``/exported_snapshots/.permissioncheck`` 
when you:

- Add a new :ref:`object store <snapshot-export-supported-storage>` for export
- Start an export

After |service| finishes exporting, |service| uploads a metadata file 
named ``.complete`` and a metadata file named ``metadata.json`` for 
each collection. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: .complete File 
      :tabid: complete

      |service| uploads the metadata file named ``.complete`` in the 
      following path on your object store: 

      .. code-block:: shell
         :copyable: false

         /exported_snapshots/<orgUUID>/<projectUUID>/<clusterName>/<initiationDateOfSnapshot>/<timestamp>/

      .. note:: 

         By default, |service| uses organization and project UUIDs in 
         the path for the metadata files. To use organization and 
         project names instead of UUIDs, set the 
         ``useOrgAndGroupNamesInExportPrefix`` flag to ``true`` via the 
         :oas-bump-atlas-op:`API 
         <updategroupclusterbackupschedule>`. |service| 
         replaces any spaces with underscores (``_``) and removes any 
         :aws:`characters that might require special handling 
         </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>` and 
         :aws:`characters to avoid 
         </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>` from the 
         organization and project names in the path.

      The ``.complete`` metadata file is in |json| format and contains 
      the following fields: 

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 35 65 

         * - Field
           - Description 

         * - ``orgId``
           - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies the 
             |service| organization.

         * - ``orgName``
           - Name of the |service| organization. 

         * - ``groupId``
           - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies the 
             project in the |service| organization.

         * - ``groupName``
           - Name of the |service| project. 

         * - ``clusterUniqueId``
           - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies the 
             |service| cluster.

         * - ``clusterName``
           - Name of the |service| project.

         * - ``snapshotInitiationDate``
           - Date when snapshot was taken.

         * - ``totalFiles``
           - Total number of files uploaded to the object store.

         * - ``labels``
           - Labels of the {+cluster+} whose snapshot was exported.

         * - ``customData``
           - Custom data, if any, that you specified when creating the 
             export job.

      .. example:: 

         .. code-block:: json

                }
              ]
            }

   .. tab:: metadata.json File 
      :tabid: metadata

      |service| uploads the ``metadata.json`` file for each collection 
      in the following path on your object store: 

      .. code-block:: shell
         :copyable: false

         /exported_snapshots/<orgUUID>/<projectUUID>/<clusterName>/<initiationDateOfSnapshot>/<timestamp>/<dbName>/<collectionName>/metadata.json

      .. note:: 

         By default, |service| uses organization and project UUIDs in 
         the path for the metadata files. To use organization and 
         project names instead of UUIDs, set the 
         ``useOrgAndGroupNamesInExportPrefix`` flag via the 
         :oas-bump-atlas-op:`API 
         <updategroupclusterbackupschedule>` to true. 
         |service| replaces any spaces with underscores (``_``) and 
         removes any :aws:`characters that might require special 
         handling </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>` and 
         :aws:`characters to avoid 
         </AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html>` from the 
         organization and project names in the path.

      The metadata file is in |json| format and contains the following 
      fields: 

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 35 65 

         * - Field
           - Description 

         * - ``collectionName``
           - Human-readable label that identifies the collection.

         * - ``indexes``
           - List of all the indexes on the collection in the format 
             returned by :manual:`db.collection.getIndexes 
             </reference/method/db.collection.getIndexes/#output>` 
             command. 

         * - ``options``
           - Configuration options defined on the collection. To learn 
             more about the options, see :manual:`db.createCollection() 
             </reference/method/db.createCollection/>` command.

         * - ``type``
           - (Optional) Type of collection. This field is only supported
	     for time series collections, with a value of ``timeseries``.
	     Leave this field unset for standard collections.

             |service| doesn't support export of ``view`` type
	     collections.

         * - ``uuid``
           - Collection's UUID. To learn more about UUID, see 
             :manual:`UUID </reference/method/UUID/>`.

      .. example:: 

         .. code-block:: json 
            :copyable: false 

            {
              "options":{

              "collectionName":"somecol"
            }

If an export job fails: 

- |service| doesn't automatically try to export again.
- |service| doesn't remove any partial data in your object store.

Exported Data Format
--------------------

|service| uploads ``gzip``-compressed :manual:`Extended JSON (v2) </reference/mongodb-extended-json>`
documents. |service| doesn't upload these documents in order. The following is
the path to the files on your :ref:`object store <snapshot-export-supported-storage>`:

.. code-block:: sh 
   :copyable: false 

   /exported_snapshots/<orgName>/<projectName>/<clusterName>/<initiationDateOfSnapshot>/<timestamp>/<dbName>/<collectionName>/<shardName>.<increment>.json.gz

Where: 

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 35 65

   * - ``<orgName>``
     - Name of your |service| organization.

   * - ``<projectName>``
     - Name of your |service| project.

   * - ``<clusterName>``
     - Name of your |service| cluster.

   * - ``<initiationDateOfSnapshot>``
     - Date when snapshot was taken.

   * - ``<timestamp>``
     - Timestamp when the export job was created.

   * - ``<dbName>``
     - Name of the database in the |service| cluster.

   * - ``<collectionName>``
     - Name of the |service| collection.

   * - ``<shardName>``
     - Name of the replica set. For sharded collections, this is the
       name of the :manual:`primary shard </core/sharded-cluster-shards/#primary-shard>`.

   * - ``<increment>``
     - Count that is incremented as chunks are uploaded. Starts at 
       ``0``.

Limitations 
-----------

You can't perform the following actions:

- Export :ref:`fallback snapshots <cps-fallback-snapshots>`.
- Have more than one active export per snapshot.
- Export :manual:`view collections </core/views>`, or
  :manual:`system collections </reference/system-collections>`,
  with the exception of ``<database>.system.js`` collections.
- Export snapshots from {+clusters+} in |a-service| project
  with IP-restricted :ref:`Encryption at Rest
  <security-kms-encryption>` enabled.
- Export snapshots from {+clusters+} hosted on |azure| or {+gcs+}
  in projects configured for
  :ref:`Private Endpoints <atlas-configure-private-endpoint>`.

Required Access
---------------

To manage your {+Cloud-Backup+} snapshots, you must have
:authrole:`Project Backup Manager` or :authrole:`Project Owner` access 
to the project.

Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves as 
a ``Project Backup Manager`` or ``Project Owner`` to the project before 
they can manage {+Cloud-Backup+} snapshots.

      :authrole:`Project Owner` role.

   .. selected-content::
      :selections: none, public, atlas-api

      Create One Export Bucket 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      To grant access to an object store for exporting snapshots, send
      a ``POST`` request to the Cloud Backups
      :oas-bump-atlas-op:`endpoint
      <creategroupbackupexportbucket>`. This enables the object store
      to receive |service| Cloud Backup snapshots. When sending the
      request to grant access, you must provide the following
      information:

   .. selected-content::
      :selections: aws, none, atlas-api

      - Unique 24-hexadecimal character string that identifies the
	unified AWS access role ID that |service| must use to 
	access the |aws| |s3| Bucket. To learn more, see
	:ref:`set-up-unified-aws-access`.

   .. selected-content::
      :selections: aws, private-link, atlas-api

      Create One PrivateLink Export Bucket
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To enable snapshot export over an |aws| Private Link connection,
      perform the following procedure:

      .. include:: /includes/backup/export-procedure-aws-pl.rst

      Update One Export Bucket to a PrivateLink Bucket
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      :gold:`IMPORTANT:` This feature is only available for |aws| |s3|
      export buckets.

      To update the ``requirePrivateNetworking`` value of an existing
      |aws| |s3| bucket to which |service| exports snapshots, send a
      ``PATCH`` request to the :oas-bump-atlas-op:`endpoint
      <updategroupbackupexportbucket>`:

   .. selected-content::
      :selections: azure, none, atlas-api

      - Unique 24-hexadecimal character string that identifies the
	|azure| Service Principal that |service| must use to
	access the {+az-bs+}. To learn more, see
	:ref:`manage-azure-access`. 
      - Service endpoint of your {+az-bs+} account. To learn more,
	see :azure:`Azure Documentation </storage/common/storage-account-get-info?tabs=azure-cli#get-service-endpoints-for-the-storage-account>`.

   .. selected-content::

   .. selected-content::
      :selections: none, none, atlas-api

      List All Export Buckets 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To retrieve all the |aws| |s3| Buckets, {+az-bs+} Containers, or
      {+gcs+} buckets to which |service| exports snapshots, send a
      ``GET`` request to the Cloud Backups
      :oas-bump-atlas-op:`endpoint <listgroupbackupexportbuckets>`.
      
      Delete One Export Bucket
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      To delete an Export Bucket, you must first disable automatic
      export of snapshots to the |aws| |s3| Bucket, {+az-bs+}
      Container, or {+gcs+} bucket for all {+clusters+} in the project
      and then send a ``DELETE`` request to the Cloud Backups
      :oas-bump-atlas-op:`endpoint <deletegroupbackupexportbucket>`
      with the ID of the Export Bucket. If necessary, send a ``GET``
      request to the :oas-bump-atlas-op:`endpoint
      <listgroupbackupexportbuckets>` to retrieve the export Bucket
      ID.

      Create Snapshot Export Job
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To export one |service| backup snapshot to an |aws| |s3| Bucket,
      {+az-bs+} Container, or {+gcs+} bucket, send a ``POST`` request
      to the Cloud Backups :oas-bump-atlas-op:`endpoint
      <creategroupclusterbackupexport>` with the ID of the snapshot to
      export and the ID of the |aws| |s3| Bucket, {+az-bs+} Container,
      or {+gcs+} bucket.

      Retrieve Snapshot Export Job 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To retrieve one snapshot export job by its ID, send a ``GET``
      request to the Cloud Backups :oas-bump-atlas-op:`endpoint
      <getgroupclusterbackupexport>` with the ID of the export job.

      To retrieve all running snapshot export jobs, send a ``GET``
      request to the Cloud Backups :oas-bump-atlas-op:`endpoint
      <listgroupclusterbackupexports>`.
