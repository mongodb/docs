ref: install
content: |
  On servers where there was only a Backup Daemon, this will be
  a new install of the |onprem| package, which is installed to the
  ``/opt/mongodb/mms/`` directory.

  a. Install the ``.deb`` package to each server by issuing the following
     command, where ``<version>`` is the version of the ``.deb`` package:

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo dpkg -i mongodb-mms_<version>_x86_64.deb

  b. When prompted whether to overwrite the currently installed version of
     conf-mms.properties, type ``N``, to keep the currently installed version.

     When the install completes, the ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/`` directory has
     both your current version, ``conf-mms.properties``, and the new version,
     ``conf-mms.properties.dpkg-dist``.
