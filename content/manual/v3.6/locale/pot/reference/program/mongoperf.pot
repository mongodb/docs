msgid ":binary:`~bin.mongoperf` is a utility to check disk I/O performance independently of MongoDB."
msgstr ""

msgid "It times tests of random disk I/O and presents the results. You can use :binary:`~bin.mongoperf` for any case apart from MongoDB. The :setting:`~mongoperf.mmf` ``true`` mode is completely generic. In that mode it is somewhat analogous to tools such as `bonnie++ <http://sourceforge.net/projects/bonnie/>`_ (albeit mongoperf is simpler)."
