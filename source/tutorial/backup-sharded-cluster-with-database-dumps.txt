Starting in MongoDB 7.1 (also available starting in 7.0.2,
6.0.11, and 5.0.22), you can back up data on sharded clusters
using :program:`mongodump`.

About this Task
---------------

:program:`mongodump` is a utility that creates a binary export of database
content. You can use the ``mongodump`` utility to take self-managed backups of
a sharded cluster.

To back up a sharded cluster with ``mongodump``, you must stop
the balancer, stop writes, and stop any schema transformation
operations on the cluster. This helps reduce the likelihood of
inconsistencies in the backup.

MongoDB provides backup and restore operations that can run with the balancer
and running transactions through the following services:

- `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database?tck=docs_server>`_

- `MongoDB Cloud Manager <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager?tck=docs_server>`_

- `MongoDB Ops Manager <https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager?tck=docs_server>`_

Before you Begin
----------------

This task uses :program:`mongodump` to back up a sharded cluster. Ensure
that you have a cluster running that contains data in sharded collections.

Version Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure requires a version of MongoDB that supports fsync
locking from :program:`mongos`.

.. |fsyncLockUnlock| replace:: the :dbcommand:`fsync` and
   :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` commands
.. include:: /includes/fsync-mongos

Admin Privileges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use this procedure, your MongoDB user must have the
:authaction:`fsync` authorization, which can be available
through a custom role or using the built-in
:authrole:`hostManager` role.

With this authorization you can run the :dbcommand:`fsync`
and :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` commands.


Steps
-----

To take a self-managed backup of a sharded cluster, complete the following
steps:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Find a Backup Window

      To find a good time to perform a backup, monitor your
      application and database usage to find a time when chunk
      migrations, resharding, and schema transformation
      operations are unlikely to occur. 

      .. note::

         These steps can only produce a consistent backup if
         they are followed exactly and no operations are in
         progress when you begin.

      For more information, see :ref:`sharded-schedule-backup`.

   .. step:: Stop the Balancer

      To prevent chunk migrations from disrupting the backup, connect to
      :program:`mongos` and use the :method:`sh.stopBalancer` method to stop
      the balancer:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.stopBalancer()

      If a balancing round is in progress, the operation waits for balancing to
      complete.

      To verify that the balancer is stopped, use the
      :method:`sh.getBalancerState` method:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         use config
         while( sh.isBalancerRunning().mode != "off" ) {
            print( "Waiting for Balancer to stop..." );
            sleep( 1000 );
         } 

   .. step:: Lock the Cluster

      The sharded cluster must remain locked during the backup process to protect
      the database from writes, which may cause inconsistencies in the backup.

      To lock a sharded cluster, connect to :program:`mongos` and use the
      :method:`db.fsyncLock` method:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.getSiblingDB("admin").fsyncLock()

      To confirm the lock, on :program:`mongos` and the primary
      :program:`mongod` of the config servers, run the following
      aggregation pipeline and ensure that all the shards are
      locked:

      .. io-code-block::

         .. input::
            :language: javascript

            db.getSiblingDB("admin").aggregate( [
               {  $currentOp: { } },
               {  $facet: {
                  "locked": [
                     { $match: { $and: [
                        { fsyncLock: { $exists: true } }
                     ] } }],
                   "unlocked": [
                     { $match: { fsyncLock: { $exists: false } } }
                   ]
               } },
               {  $project: {
                  "fsyncLocked": { $gt: [ { $size: "$locked" }, 0 ] },
                  "fsyncUnlocked": { $gt: [ { $size: "$unlocked" }, 0 ] }
               } }
             ] )

         .. output::
            :language: json

            [ { fsyncLocked: true }, { fsyncUnlocked: false } ]

   .. step:: Take Backup

      To back up the sharded cluster, use ``mongodump`` to connect to
      :program:`mongos` and perform the backup:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mongodump \
            --host mongos.example.net \
            --port 27017 \
            --username user \
            --password "passwd" \
            --out /opt/backups/example-cluster-1

   .. step:: Unlock the Cluster

      After the backup completes, you can unlock the cluster to allow writes
      to resume.

      To unlock the cluster, use the :method:`db.fsyncUnlock` method:

      .. code-block:: bash

         db.getSibling("admin").fsyncUnlock()

      To confirm the unlock, on :program:`mongos` and the primary
      :program:`mongod` of the config servers, run the following
      aggregation pipeline and ensure that all shards are unlocked:

      .. io-code-block::

         .. input::
            :language: javascript

            db.getSiblingDB("admin").aggregate( [
               {  $currentOp: { } },
               {  $facet: {
                  "locked": [
                     { $match: { $and: [
                        { fsyncLock: { $exists: true } }
                     ] } }],
                   "unlocked": [
                     { $match: { fsyncLock: { $exists: false } } }
                   ]
               } },
               { $project: {
                  "fsyncLocked": { $gt: [ { $size: "$locked" }, 0 ] },
                  "fsyncUnlocked": { $gt: [ { $size: "$unlocked" }, 0 ] }
               } }
             ] )

         .. output::
            :language: json

            [ { fsyncLocked: false }, { fsyncUnlocked: true } ]

   .. step:: Restart the Balancer

      To restart the balancer, use the :method:`sh.startBalancer` method:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.startBalancer()

      To confirm that the balancer is running, use the
      :method:`sh.getBalancerState` method:

      .. io-code-block::

         .. input::
            :language: javascript

            sh.getBalancerState()

         .. output::
            :language: javascript

            true

      The command returns ``true`` when the balancer is running.

Next Steps
----------

You can restore data from a :program:`mongodump` backup using :program:`mongorestore`.

- To migrate to a replica set or standalone server, execute ``mongorestore``
  against :program:`mongod`.

- To restore to a sharded cluster, execute ``mongorestore`` against
  :program:`mongos` with :option:`--nsExclude <mongorestore --nsExclude>` set
  to exclude the ``config`` database: 

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongorestore --nsExclude='config.*' /data/backup 

.. important:: 
  
  ``mongorestore`` does not shard restored collections on the destination cluster. 

  To ensure that a restored collection is sharded on the destination cluster, 
  create a collection with the same namespace on the destination cluster then 
  :ref:`shard the collection <sharding-shard-key-creation>` before running ``mongorestore``.
  The :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` will eventually spread the restored documents
  across the shards of the destination cluster.
