.. method:: db.collection.renameCollection()

   :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` provides a helper for
   the :dbcommand:`renameCollection` :term:`database command` in the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to rename existing collections.

   :param string target: Specifies the new name of the
                         collection. Enclose the string in quotes.

   :param boolean dropTarget: Optional. If ``true``, :binary:`~bin.mongod`
                              will drop the `target` of
                              :dbcommand:`renameCollection` prior to
                              renaming the collection.

   Call the :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method on a
   collection object, to rename a collection. Specify the new name of
   the collection as an argument. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.rrecord.renameCollection("record")

   This operation will rename the ``rrecord`` collection to
   ``record``. If the target name (i.e. ``record``) is the name of an
   existing collection, then the operation will fail.

   Consider the following limitations:

   - :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` cannot move a
     collection between databases. Use :dbcommand:`renameCollection`
     for these rename operations.

   - :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` cannot operation on
     sharded collections.

   The :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method operates
   within a collection by changing the metadata associated with a
   given collection.

   Refer to the documentation :dbcommand:`renameCollection` for
   additional warnings and messages.

   .. warning::

      The :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()` method and
      :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command will invalidate open
      cursors which interrupts queries that are currently returning
      data.
