Overview
--------

The ``priority`` settings of replica set members affect both the timing
and the outcome of :doc:`elections </core/replica-set-elections>` for
primary. Use this setting to ensure that some members are more likely
to become primary and that others can never become primary. Consider
assigning higher priorities to replica set members with better
hardware, better network connections, or geolocation value. This
creates a chain of succession, allowing for more predictable
performance in the event of an election.

The value of the member's
:rsconf:`~members[n].priority` setting determines the
member's :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` in elections. The higher the number,
the higher the priority.

Considerations
--------------

To modify priorities, you update the :rsconf:`members`
array in the replica configuration object. The array index begins with
``0``. Do **not** confuse this index value with the value of the replica
set member's :rsconf:`members[n]._id` field in the
array.

The value of :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` can be any
floating point (i.e. decimal) number between ``0`` and ``1000``. The
default value for the ``priority`` field is ``1``.

To block a member from seeking election as primary, assign it a priority
of ``0``. :ref:`Hidden members <replica-set-hidden-members>` and
:ref:`delayed members <replica-set-delayed-members>` have
``priority`` set to ``0``. 

For :doc:`arbiters </core/replica-set-arbiter>`, the default
``priority`` value is ``1``; however, arbiters cannot
become primary regardless of the configured value.

Adjust priority settings during a scheduled maintenance window.
Reconfiguring priority can force the current primary to step down,
leading to an election. Before an election, the primary closes all open
:term:`client` connections.
