Overview
--------

Atlas App Services provides various resources for getting help with your App.

Professional Support
--------------------

MongoDB offers professional support for App Services and Atlas. Paid
support includes help with training, upgrades, and general technical
support for issues in your database or app. We strongly recommend
MongoDB's professional support for production apps and mission-critical
use cases.

To learn more about professional support, see `Atlas Support &
Subscriptions <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/pricing/support-subscriptions?tck=docs_realm>`__.

The official `MongoDB Community Forums
<https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/c/realm/9>`__ are a great
place to meet other developers, ask and answer questions, and stay
up-to-date with the latest App Services features and releases. You can also
interact with MongoDB employees, like our community team, engineers, and
product managers, who are active forum contributors.

MongoDB monitors & answers questions with the ``realm`` tag on Stack
Overflow, a forum to ask programming questions and get help with
specific errors. `Ask an App Services- or Realm-related question
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=realm>`_ or read through
