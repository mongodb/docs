================================
Replica Set Data Synchronization
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In order to maintain up to date copies of the shared data set, members
of a replica set :term:`sync` or replicate data from other
members. MongoDB uses two forms of data synchronization: :ref:`initial
sync <replica-set-initial-sync>` to populate new members with the full
data set, and the replication to apply ongoing changes to the entire
set.

.. _replica-set-initial-sync:

Initial Sync
------------

Replica set members use initial sync to import the set's data before
beginning to replicate. Initial sync occurs when a new member joins a
set. Members perform an initial sync when they cannot use the oplog
replication to become current. For example, if a member is offline for
a long period of time and rejoins the set, it may perform a new
initial sync before resuming replication.

.. commenting following sentence out because it doesn't make sense. --sk

   By default, the member syncs from the *closest* member of the set that
   is either the primary or another secondary with more recent oplog
   entries than the member itself. As a result, two secondaries cannot
   sync from each other.

.. _replica-set-replication:

Replication
-----------

Replica set members replicate data continuously after the initial
sync. This process keeps the members up to date with all changes to
the replica set's data. In most cases, secondaries synchronize from
the primary. Secondaries may automatically change their *sync targets*
if needed based changes the ping time and state of other members'
replication.

.. COMMENT: 2013-05-23 > Removed following internal mechanics information.

   In MongoDB 2.0, secondaries will change sync targets only if the
   connection the sync target drops or produces an error.
   Secondaries will stop syncing from a member if
   the connection used to poll oplog entries is unresponsive for 30
   seconds. If a connection times out, the member may select a new
   member to sync from.

   If you have two secondary members in one data center and a primary in
   a second facility, and if you start all three instances at roughly
   the same time (i.e. with no existing data sets or oplog), both
   secondaries will likely sync from the primary, as neither secondary
   has more recent oplog entries.
   If you restart one of the secondaries, then when it rejoins the set
   it will likely begin syncing from the other secondary because of
   proximity.

   If you have a primary in one facility and a secondary in an
   alternate facility, and if you add another secondary to the alternate
   facility, the new secondary will likely sync from the existing
   secondary because it is closer than the primary.

.. END-COMMENT

For a member to sync from another, the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].buildIndexes` setting for both
members must have the same value/
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].buildIndexes` must be either
``true`` or ``false`` for both members.

Beginning in version 2.2, secondaries will avoid syncing from
:ref:`delayed members <replica-set-delayed-members>` and :ref:`hidden
members <replica-set-hidden-members>`.

Consistency and Durability
--------------------------

.. TODO continue

In a replica set, only the primary can accept write operations. Writing
only to the primary provides :term:`strict consistency` among members.

:term:`Journaling <journal>` provides single-instance write durability.
Without journaling, if a MongoDB instance terminates
ungracefully, you should assume that the database is in a corrupt or
inconsistent state.

.. _replica-set-internals-multi-threaded-replication:

Multithreaded Replication
-------------------------

MongoDB applies write operations in batches using multiple threads to
improve concurrency. MongoDB groups batches by namespace and applies
operations using a group of threads, but always applies the write
operations to a namespace in order.

While applying a batch, MongoDB blocks all reads. As a result,
secondaries can never return data that reflects a state that never
existed on the primary.

Pre-Fetching Indexes to Improve Replication Throughput
------------------------------------------------------

To help improve the performance of applying oplog entries, MongoDB
fetches memory pages that hold affected data and indexes. This
*pre-fetch* stage minimizes the amount of time MongoDB holds the write
lock while applying oplog entries. By default, secondaries will
pre-fetch all :ref:`indexes`.

Optionally, you can disable all pre-fetching or only pre-fetch
the index on the ``_id`` field. See the :setting:`replIndexPrefetch`
setting for more information.
