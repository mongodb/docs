  a. Create a file named ``SimpleQuery.kt``. 
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the ``SimpleQuery.kt`` 
     file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:

     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Searches for the word ``baseball`` in
       the ``plot`` field. It includes a: 
       
       - :manual:`$limit </reference/operator/aggregation/limit>` stage 
         to limit the output to 5 results 
       - :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` 
         stage to exclude all fields except ``title`` and ``plot``

     - Prints the documents that match the query from the ``AggregateFlow`` instance.
