Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the different settings to control
the behavior of your ``MongoClient``.

The following sections describe commonly used settings:

- :ref:`MongoClient Settings <mcs-settings>`
- :ref:`Cluster Settings <mcs-cluster-settings>`
- :ref:`Socket Settings <mcs-socket-settings>`
- :ref:`Connection Pool Settings <mcs-connectionpool-settings>`
- :ref:`Server Settings <mcs-server-settings>`
- :ref:`TLS/SSL Settings <mcs-ssl-settings>`

.. _mcs-settings:

MongoClient Settings
--------------------

You can control the behavior of your ``MongoClient`` by creating and passing
in a `MongoClientSettings <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.html>`__
object to the `MongoClients.create() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/MongoClients.html#create(com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings)>`__
method.

To create a ``MongoClientSettings`` object, use the
``MongoClientSettings.builder()`` method and chain methods to specify your
settings. After chaining them, use the ``build()`` method to create the
``MongoClientSettings`` object.

The following table describes the methods you can chain to modify your
connection behavior:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``addCommandListener()``
     - Adds a listener for :ref:`command events <command-events-java>`.

   * - ``applicationName()``
     - Sets the logical name of the application using the ``MongoClient``.

   * - ``applyConnectionString()``
     - Applies the settings from the given ``ConnectionString`` to the
       builder. If you omit this method, the driver attempts to connect to
       ``localhost``.

   * - ``applyToClusterSettings()``
     - Applies the ``ClusterSettings.Builder`` block and then sets the
       :ref:`cluster settings <mcs-cluster-settings>`.

   * - ``applyToConnectionPoolSettings()``
     - Applies the ``ConnectionPoolSettings.Builder`` block and then sets the
       :ref:`connection pool settings <mcs-connectionpool-settings>`.

   * - ``applyToLoggerSettings()``
     - Applies the ``LoggerSettings.Builder`` block and then sets the
       :ref:`logger settings <mcs-logger-settings>`.

   * - ``applyToServerSettings()``
     - Applies the ``ServerSettings.Builder`` block and then sets the
       :ref:`server settings <mcs-server-settings>`.

   * - ``applyToSocketSettings()``
     - Applies the ``SocketSettings.Builder`` block and then sets the
       :ref:`socket settings <mcs-socket-settings>`.

   * - ``applyToSslSettings()``
     - Applies the ``SslSettings.Builder`` block and then sets the
       :ref:`TLS/SSL settings <mcs-ssl-settings>`.

   * - ``autoEncryptionSettings()``
     - | Sets the :ref:`auto-encryption settings <csfle-fundamentals-automatic-encryption>`.
       |
       | If you omit ``keyVaultClient`` or set
         ``bypassAutomaticEncryption`` to false in your
         ``AutoEncryptionSettings``, the driver creates a separate,
         internal ``MongoClient``.
       |
       | The internal ``MongoClient`` configuration differs from the
         parent ``MongoClient`` by setting the ``minPoolSize`` to  0 and
         omitting the ``AutoEncryptionSettings``.

   * - ``codecRegistry()``
     - Sets the :ref:`codec registry <codecs-codecregistry>`.

   * - ``commandListenerList()``
     - Sets the :ref:`command listeners <command-events-java>`.

   * - ``compressorList()``
     - Sets the :ref:`compressors <compression>` to use for compressing
       messages to the server.

   * - ``credential()``
     - Sets the :ref:`credential <authentication-mechanisms-java>`.

   * - ``readConcern()``
     - Sets the :manual:`read concern </reference/read-concern/>`.

   * - ``readPreference()``
     - | Sets the :manual:`read preference </core/read-preference/>`.
       |
       | **Default**: ``primary``

   * - ``retryReads()``
     - | Whether the driver performs :manual:`retry reads </core/retryable-reads/>`
         if a network error occurs.
       |
       | **Default**: ``true``

   * - ``retryWrites()``
     - | Whether the driver performs :manual:`retry writes </core/retryable-writes/>`
         if a network error occurs.
       |
       | **Default**: ``true``

   * - ``serverApi()``
     - Sets the :ref:`server API <stable-api-java>` to use when sending
       commands to the server.

   * - ``transportSettings()``
     - Sets `TransportSettings <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/TransportSettings.html>`__.

   * - ``uuidRepresentation()``
     - Sets the UUID representation to use when encoding instances of UUID
       and decoding BSON binary values with subtype of 3.

   * - ``writeConcern()``
     - | Sets the :manual:`write concern </reference/write-concern/>`.
       |
       | **Default**: ``WriteConcern#ACKNOWLEDGED``. For more information about
         the default value, see :manual:`Implicit Default Write Concern </reference/write-concern/#implicit-default-write-concern>`.

.. _connection-string-example:

Example
~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates specifying a ``ConnectionString``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin ConnectionString
   :end-before: end ConnectionString
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3
   :dedent:

.. note:: Chain Order

   Some options in the settings map to a connection string option.
   If you specify the same options in your settings and connection
   string, the order you chain them determines which option the driver
   uses. The driver uses the **last** setting it reads.

   For example, this snippet contains settings with the following times
   for the driver to connect to an available socket:

   - The connection string specifies within ``2 SECONDS``
   - The :ref:`socket settings <mcs-socket-settings>` specifies within
     ``5 SECONDS``

   .. code-block:: java
      :emphasize-lines: 2,4

      MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(
         MongoClientSettings.builder().applyConnectionString(new ConnectionString("mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>/<auth db>?connectTimeoutMS=2000"))
            .applyToSocketSettings(builder ->
            builder.connectTimeout(5L, SECONDS))
            .build());

   Since the driver reads the socket settings options last, the driver
   expects to connect to an available socket within ``5 SECONDS`` before
   timing out.

.. tip:: Log Your Settings

   To log the ``MongoClient`` instance settings,
   set the ``org.mongodb.driver.client`` named
   logger to the ``INFO`` level.

   To learn more about logging with the {+driver-long+}, see the 
   :ref:`java-fundamentals-logging` guide. 

.. _mcs-cluster-settings:

Cluster Settings
----------------

Chain the `applyToClusterSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToClusterSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
method to modify the driver's behavior when interacting with your
MongoDB cluster.

The following table describes the methods you can chain to your
settings to modify the driver's behavior:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ``applyConnectionString()``
     - Uses the settings from a ``ConnectionString`` object.

   * - ``applySettings()``
     - Uses the cluster settings specified in a ``ClusterSettings`` object.

   * - ``hosts()``
     - Sets all the specified locations of a Mongo deployment.

   * - ``localThreshold()``
     - | Sets the amount of time that a serverâ€™s round trip can take and still
         be eligible for server selection.

   * - ``requiredClusterType()``
     - Sets the type of cluster required for the cluster.

   * - ``requiredReplicaSetName()``
     - Sets the replica set name required for the cluster.

   * - ``serverSelectionTimeout()``
     - | Sets the maximum time to select a primary node before throwing a
         timeout exception.
       |
       | **Default**: ``30 seconds``

   * - ``serverSelector()``
     - Adds a server selector to apply before server selection.
  
   * - ``srvHost()``
     - | Sets the host name to use to look up an SRV DNS record to find the
         MongoDB hosts. 
       | 
       | If you want to enable the processing of TXT records associated with the host, 
         specify the SRV host in the connection string 
         using the ``applyConnectionString()`` method.
       |
       | For example:
       
       .. code-block:: java
          :emphasize-lines: 3
     
              MongoClient mongoClient = 
                MongoClients.create(MongoClientSettings.builder()
                .applyConnectionString(new ConnectionString("mongodb+srv://host1.acme.com")))

   * - ``srvMaxHosts()``
     - | Sets the maximum number of hosts the driver can connect to when using
         the DNS seedlist (SRV) connection protocol, identified by the
         ``mongodb+srv`` connection string prefix.
       |
       | Throws an exception if you are not using the SRV connection protocol.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example specifies for the driver to connect directly to a server,
regardless of the type of MongoDB cluster it's a part of:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin ClusterSettings
   :end-before: end ClusterSettings
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3-4
   :dedent:

.. tip::

   This is analogous to the ``directConnection`` parameter you can specify
   in your connection URI. See :ref:`<connection-options>` for more
   information.

.. _mcs-connectionpool-settings:

Connection Pool Settings
------------------------

Chain the `applyToConnectionPoolSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToConnectionPoolSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
method to modify the way the driver manages its connection pool.

The following table describes the methods you can chain to your
settings to modify the driver's behavior:

     - | Sets the maximum number of connections associated with a connection
         pool.
       |
       | **Default**: ``100``

   * - ``maxWaitTime()``
     - | Sets the maximum time to wait for an available connection.
       |
       | **Default**: ``2 minutes``

   * - ``minSize()``
     - | Sets the minimum number of connections associated with a connection
         pool.
       |
       | **Default**: ``0``


.. note::

   This ``maxSize`` and ``minSize`` settings apply to each server
   in the cluster you connect the driver to.

   For example, assume you connect the driver to a cluster with three
   ``mongos`` servers. This means that there can be at most ``maxSize``
   connections and at least ``minSize`` connections to each ``mongos`` server.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example specifies the following driver behavior in a pool of
``Connection`` types:

- The thread to wait at most ``10 SECONDS`` for an available connection
- To have at most ``200`` connections associated with the pool
