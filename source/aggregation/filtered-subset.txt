   :description: Learn to use the MongoDB Node.js Driver to create an aggregation pipeline that filters, sorts, and formats a subset of documents in a MongoDB collection.

Introduction
------------

In this tutorial, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to
construct an aggregation pipeline, perform the
aggregation on a collection, and print the results by completing and
running a sample app. This aggregation performs the following operations:

- Matches a subset of documents by a field value
- Formats result documents

.. tip::

   You can also query for a subset of documents in a collection by using the
   Query API. To learn how to specify a query, see the 
   :ref:`Read Operations guides <node-read-operations>`.

Aggregation Task Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial demonstrates how to query a collection for a specific
subset of documents in a collection. The results contain
documents that describe the three youngest people who are engineers.

This example uses one collection, ``persons``, which contains
documents describing people. Each document includes a person's name,
date of birth, vocation, and other details.

Before You Get Started
----------------------

Before you start this tutorial, complete the
:ref:`node-agg-tutorial-template-app` instructions to set up a working
Node.js application.

After you set up the app, access the ``persons`` collection by adding the
following code to the application:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/filtered-subset.js
   :language: javascript
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: start-collection
   :end-before: end-collection
   :dedent:

Delete any existing data in the collections and insert sample data into
the ``persons`` collection as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/filtered-subset.js
   :language: javascript
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: start-insert-persons
   :end-before: end-insert-persons
   :dedent:

Tutorial
--------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Add a match stage for people who are engineers

      First, add a :manual:`$match
      </reference/operator/aggregation/match>` stage that finds documents in which
      the value of the ``vocation`` field is ``"ENGINEER"``:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/filtered-subset.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: start-match
         :end-before: end-match
         :dedent:

   .. step:: Add a sort stage to sort from youngest to oldest

      Next, add a :manual:`$sort
      </reference/operator/aggregation/sort>` stage that sorts the
      documents in descending order by the ``dateofbirth`` field to
      list the youngest people first:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/filtered-subset.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: start-sort
         :end-before: end-sort
         :dedent:

   .. step:: Add a limit stage to see only three results

      Next, add a :manual:`$limit </reference/operator/aggregation/limit>`
      stage to the pipeline to output only the first three documents in
      the results.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/filtered-subset.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: start-limit
         :end-before: end-limit
         :dedent:

   .. step:: Add an unset stage to remove unneeded fields

      Finally, add an :manual:`$unset
      </reference/operator/aggregation/unset>` stage. The
      ``$unset`` stage removes unnecessary fields from the result documents:
            
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/filtered-subset.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: start-unset
         :end-before: end-unset
         :dedent:

      .. tip::

         Use the ``$unset`` operator instead of ``$project`` to avoid
         modifying the aggregation pipeline if documents with
         different fields are added to the collection.

   .. step:: Run the aggregation pipeline

      Add the following code to the end of your application to perform
      the aggregation on the ``persons`` collection:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/filtered-subset.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: start-run-agg
         :end-before: end-run-agg
         :dedent:

      Finally, run the following command in your shell to start your
      application:

      .. code-block:: bash
      
         node agg_tutorial.js

   .. step:: Interpret results

      The aggregated result contains three documents. The documents
      represent the three youngest people with the vocation of ``"ENGINEER"``,
      ordered from youngest to oldest. The results omit the ``_id`` and ``address``
      fields.

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

         {
           person_id: '7363626383',
           firstname: 'Carl',
           lastname: 'Simmons',
           dateofbirth: 1998-12-26T13:13:55.000Z,
           vocation: 'ENGINEER'
         }
         {
           person_id: '1723338115',
           firstname: 'Olive',
           lastname: 'Ranieri',
           dateofbirth: 1985-05-12T23:14:30.000Z,
           gender: 'FEMALE',
           vocation: 'ENGINEER'
         }
         {
           person_id: '6392529400',
           firstname: 'Elise',
           lastname: 'Smith',
           dateofbirth: 1972-01-13T09:32:07.000Z,
           vocation: 'ENGINEER'
         }
