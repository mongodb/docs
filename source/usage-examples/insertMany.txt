=========================
Insert Multiple Documents
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can insert a multiple documents into a collection in a single
operation by calling the ``insertMany()`` method on a ``MongoCollection``
object. To insert them, add your ``Document`` objects that contain the
fields and values that you want to store to a ``List`` and pass it to
your call to ``insertMany()``. If you call the ``insertMany()`` method on
a collection that does not exist yet, the server creates it for you.

For more information on inserting data using MongoDB with the Java driver,
see our guide (TODO: Fundamentals > CRUD Operations > Write Operations)
on inserting documents.

Upon successful insert, ``insertMany()`` returns an instance of
``InsertManyResult``. You can retrieve information such as the ``_id``
fields of the documents you inserted by calling the ``getInsertedIds()``
method on the ``InsertManyResult``.

If your insert operation fails, the driver raises an exception. For more
information on the types of exceptions raised under specific conditions,
see the API documentation for ``insertMany()``, linked at the bottom of
this page.

Example
-------

The following snippet inserts a multiple documents into the ``movies``
collection.

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/InsertMany.java
   :language: java

If you are using the **legacy API**, see (TODO: FAQ ?) to determine what
changes you need to make to this code example.

When you run the example, you should see output that resembles the following
with the inserted document ``ObjectId`` in each of the value fields:

.. code-block:: none

   Inserted document ids: {0=BsonObjectId{value=...}, 1=BsonObjectId{value=...}}
