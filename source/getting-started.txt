Overview
--------

|service-fullname| provides an easy way to host and manage your data in
the cloud. This tutorial guides you through creating an |service|
{+cluster+}, connecting to it, inserting a document, and loading sample 
data.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create an |service| account.

      :doc:`Register for an Atlas account
      </tutorial/create-atlas-account>` using your Google Account or
      an email address.

   .. step:: Deploy a {+free-cluster+}.

      :doc:`Create and deploy a {+free-cluster+} 
      </tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster>`. You can use |service|
      {+free-clusters+} as a small-scale development
      environment to host your data. {+Free-clusters+} never expire, and
      provide access to a :ref:`subset <atlas-free-tier>` of |service| 
      features.

   .. step:: Add your connection IP address to your IP access list.

      :doc:`Add your IP address to a list of trusted IP addresses
      </security/add-ip-address-to-list>`. An |ipaddr| uniquely 
      identifies a device connecting to a network. In |service|, you 
      can connect to a {+cluster+} only from a trusted IP address. 
      Within |service|, you can create a list of trusted IP addresses, 
      referred to as an IP access list. An IP accesss list defines 
      the IP addresses that can connect to your {+cluster+} and access 
      your data.

   .. step:: Create a databse user for your {+cluster+}.

      :doc:`Create a database user to access your {+cluster+}
      </tutorial/create-mongodb-user-for-cluster>`. For
      security purposes, |service| requires clients to authenticate as 
      MongoDB database users to access {+clusters+}.

   .. step:: Connect to your {+cluster+}.

      :doc:`Connect to your {+cluster+} 
      </tutorial/connect-to-your-cluster>` using the {+mongosh+}, the 
      :driver:`Node.js driver </node/>`, the :driver:`PyMongo driver
      </python/>`, or :compass:`Compass </>`.

   .. step:: Insert and view a document.

      :doc:`Insert a document into your cluster
      </tutorial/insert-data-into-your-cluster>` using one of the 
      supported :driver:`MongoDB Drivers </>`. MongoDB drivers let you 
      interact with your databases programmatically with a supported 
      programming language. 

   .. step:: Load sample data.

      :ref:`Load sample data into your Atlas {+clusters+} 
      <sample-data>`. |service| provides sample data that you can load 
      into your |service| {+clusters+}. You can use this data to 
      quickly get started experimenting with data in MongoDB and using 
      tools such as the :ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui>` and 
      :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>`.
