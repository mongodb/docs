   With :ref:`keyfile <internal-auth-keyfile>` authentication, the
   {{components}} in the {{deployment}} use the contents of the keyfile as the
   shared password for authenticating other members in the deployment. Only
   {{components}} with the correct keyfile can join the {{deployment}}.
   
   The content of the keyfile must be the same for all members of the
   {{deployment}}.

   You can generate a keyfile using any method you choose. The contents
   of the keyfile must be between 6 and 1024 characters long. 

   .. note::

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/keyfile-file-permission.rst

   The following operation uses ``openssl`` to generate a complex
   pseudo-random 1024 character string to use for a keyfile. It then
   uses ``chmod`` to change file permissions to provide read permissions
   for the file owner only:

   Copy the keyfile to each server hosting the {{deployment}} members. For
   simplicity in configuration and maintenance, save the keyfile to a
   consistent location for each server, such as the file path specified in
   the {{programs}} :setting:`storage.dbPath` setting.

   .. important::
     
      If the {{programs}} cannot access the keyfile, they cannot communicate
      with the {{deployment}}. Avoid storing the keyfile on storage mediums
      that can be easily disconnected from the hardware hosting the
      {{programs}}, such as a USB drive or a network attached storage device.

   Ensure that the user running the {{programs}} can access the keyfile.

  On UNIX systems, the keyfile must not have group or world
  permissions. On Windows systems, keyfile permissions are not checked.
