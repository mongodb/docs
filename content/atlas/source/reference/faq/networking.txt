.. _faq-public-ip-changes:

Do |service| {+cluster+}\'s public IPs ever change?
---------------------------------------------------

The factors that determine if and when |a-service| {+cluster+}\'s public IP 
address changes depends on the cluster tier.

.. note::

    This section applies to ``M10`` or larger {+dedicated-clusters+} only 
    unless specified.

|A-service| {+cluster+}\'s public IP addresses must change when you:

- Vertically scale an :ref:`NVMe-backed <nvme-storage>` cluster on
  :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>` or :ref:`Microsoft Azure
  <microsoft-azure>`.
- :ref:`Convert a replica set to a sharded cluster <scale-cluster-sharding>`.
- :ref:`Add shards to a sharded cluster <scale-cluster-shardNum>`.
- :ref:`Change the region into which a cluster is deployed <scale-cluster-region>`.
- :ref:`Scale <scale-cluster-open-dialog>` an ``M0`` or {+Flex-cluster+}
  to an ``M10`` or larger {+cluster+}.
- :ref:`Terminate <terminate-cluster>` then re-deploy a 
  {+cluster+} with the same name *but in a different tier* within 
  36 hours.
- :ref:`Enable Encryption at Rest 
  <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>` on a {+cluster+} with a 
  lifetime less than 12 hours.

|A-service| {+cluster+}\'s public IPs don't change when you:

- Vertically scale a {+cluster+} on :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  <amazon-aws>` or :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>` that is not
  backed by an :ref:`NVMe SSD <nvme-storage>`, or vertically
  scale a {+cluster+} from any tier on :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`.
- Unpause the {+cluster+}.
- :ref:`Terminate <terminate-cluster>` and then re-deploy a {+cluster+}
  with a lifetime of 12 hours or more within 12-36 hours.
- Experience a maintenance or a healing event on your {+cluster+}.

To find the public IP address for any node in your {+cluster+}, use the
``nslookup`` tool from the command line. The IP address is shown in the
``Address`` portion of the output.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ nslookup ds-shard-00-00-17jcm.mongodb-dev.net

    Address: 34.226.104.79

.. _faq-atlas-side-hostnames:

Can I specify my own VPC for my |service-fullname| project?
-----------------------------------------------------------

No. An |service| project, and its clusters, are associated with a
region-specific |vpc|.

|service| creates a |vpc| when you deploy the first ``M10+`` dedicated
paid cluster to a given provider and region. For multi-region clusters,
|service| creates one |vpc| per region if there is not already a |vpc|
for that region.

*(AWS deployments only)* |service| also creates a |vpc| when you create
a :doc:`VPC peering connection </security-vpc-peering>` to an |aws|
|vpc|. |service| creates the |vpc| in the same region as the peered
|vpc|.

To use a different |vpc| (that is, on the customer's own cloud
infrastructure accounts), you would need to use |mms-full|
or Ops Manager.

How do I find my Atlas-side hostnames to open up my outbound firewall?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If your firewall blocks outbound network connections, you must configure 
outbound access from your application environment to |service-fullname|.

Automatically Resolve IP Addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :ref:`SRV Connection String Format <connections-dns-seedlist>`, 
which automatically resolves to the appropriate IP addresses for 
|service-fullname| services and clusters.

Retrieve Specific IP Addresses for Outbound Firewall Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application environment requires configuring outbound firewall rules 
using specific IP addresses, you can retrieve a list of IP addresses associated 
with all clusters and services in your project using the 
:oas-bump-atlas-op:`Return All IP Addresses for One Project <getgroupipaddresses>` 
API endpoint.

.. note::

   These IP addresses are dynamic and subject to frequent changes. 
   Use this option only if your application can programmatically 
   integrate these IP addresses into your orchestration automation, 
   enabling frequent updates to your firewall rules.

.. _faq-cross-region:

How many cross-region network permissions does |service| support?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/facts/cross-region-limits.rst

If you would exceed the cross-region permissions limit when creating a
cluster through the {+atlas-admin-api+}, the |api| returns the following
error:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "error" : 403,
     "detail" : "Cannot have more than 40 cross-region network permissions.",
     "reason" : "Forbidden"
   }

.. _atlas-faq-aws-transit-gateway:

Can Atlas be used with AWS Transit Gateway?
-------------------------------------------

Yes. |aws| PrivateLink powers |service| Private Endpoints. This allows
for transitive connectivity. You can use the
:aws:`AWS Transit Gateway </vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-getting-started.html>`
with your |vpc| if you connected your |vpc| to |service| via |aws|
PrivateLink.

.. _atlas-faq-aws-direct-connect:

Can Atlas be used with AWS Direct Connect?
------------------------------------------

Yes. |aws| PrivateLink powers |service| Private Endpoints. This allows
for transitive connectivity. You can use :aws:`AWS Direct Connect </whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/aws-direct-connect-network-to-amazon.html>` with your
|vpc| if you connected your |vpc| to |service| via |aws| PrivateLink.
