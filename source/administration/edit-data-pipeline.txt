You can make changes to your {+dl+} pipelines through the |service| 
|ui|, {+dl+} Pipelines |api|, and the {+atlas-cli+}, including:

- Edit the data extraction schedule
- Edit the dataset retention policy
- Edit the data storage region
- Change the fields to exclude from your {+dl+} datasets

Procedure
---------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-dataLakePipelines-update.rst
   
   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      .. _adl-edit-dataset-pipeline-api:

      To edit a pipeline through the |api|, send a ``PATCH`` request to the 
      :oas-atlas-tag:`{+dl+} </Data-Lake-Pipelines>` ``pipelines`` endpoint 
      with the name of the pipeline that you want to edit. To learn more 
      about the ``pipelines`` endpoint syntax and parameters for updating a 
      pipeline, see :oas-atlas-op:`Update One Data Lake Pipeline 
      </updatePipeline>`.

      .. tip:: 

         You can send a ``GET`` request to the 
         :oas-atlas-op:`availableSchedules 
         </listPipelineSchedules>` endpoint to retrieve the 
         list of backup schedule policy items that you can use to change the 
         schedule of your {+dl+} pipelines of type ``PERIODIC_DPS``.
   
   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      .. _adl-edit-dataset-pipeline-ui:

      .. procedure:: 
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Log in to `MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`__.

         .. step::  Select :guilabel:`Data Lake` under :guilabel:`Deployment` on the left-hand navigation.

         .. step:: Click :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` in the :guilabel:`Actions` column for the pipeline that you wish to modify.

         .. step:: (Optional) Configure a :guilabel:`Dataset Retention Policy`.

            A dataset retention policy can help manage your {+dl+} storage
            by automatically deleting old datasets after a duration you specify.

            To configure a dataset retention policy for a pipeline, toggle
            :guilabel:`Dataset Retention Policy` to ``ON`` and enter a time value,
            in days, weeks, or months.

            .. important::

               Changes to your pipeline's dataset retention policy take effect immediately.
               If you lower the retention duration for a pipeline with existing datasets,
               then datasets that are beyond the new duration expire immediately.

         .. step:: (Optional) Make changes to your data extraction schedule. 

            Before making changes to your :guilabel:`Basic Schedule`, ensure 
            that your desired data extraction frequency is similar to your 
            current backup schedule. For example, if you wish to switch to 
            ``Daily``, you must have a ``Daily`` backup schedule configured 
            in your policy. Or, if you want to switch to a schedule of once a 
            week, you must have a ``Weekly`` backup schedule configured in 
            your policy. To learn more, see :atlas:`Backup Scheduling 
            </backup/cloud-backup/overview/#backup-scheduling--retention--and-on-demand-backup-snapshots>`. 
            You can also send a ``GET`` request to the {+dl+} 
            :oas-atlas-op:`availableSchedules 
            </returnAvailableSchedulesForPipeline>` endpoint to retrieve the 
            list of backup schedule policy items that you can use to change 
            the schedule of your {+dl+} pipeline.

         .. step:: (Optional) Make changes to your data storage region.

            {+adl+} provides optimized storage in the following |aws| regions:

            .. include:: /includes/list-table-supported-aws-regions.rst

         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Continue`.

         .. step:: (Optional) Make changes to the fields excluded from your {+dl+} datasets.

            - Click :guilabel:`Add Field` and specify :guilabel:`Field Name` 
              to add fields to the excluded fields list.

            - Click :guilabel:`Delete All` to remove all the fields from the 
              excluded fields list. 

            - Click :icon:`trash-alt` next to a field to remove that  
              field from the excluded fields list.

         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Review Changes` to review the changes to your pipeline.

         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Apply Changes` for the changes to take effect.
