	We are introducing new {+Flex-clusters+} in a phased approach. Once your 
	org has the ability to create {+Flex-clusters+}, you will no longer be 
	able to create M2 and M5 clusters or {+Serverless-instances+} in the 
	{+atlas-ui+}.

	We will also be seamlessly migrating existing M2 and M5 clusters to 
	{+Flex-clusters+} in a phased manner. There will be no downtime and 
	you will not need to make any changes to your configuration during this 
	migration.
