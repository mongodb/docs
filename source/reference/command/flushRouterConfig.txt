.. dbcommand:: flushRouterConfig

   :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` clears the cached routing table in a
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance. Subsequent commands against that 
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` will repopulate the routing table cache from 
   the :term:`config server` as they execute.

   Use this command to force the routing table cache to be refreshed 
   from the :term:`config server` if it contains more recent data. In 
   most cases, this happens automatically. You should need to run 
   :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` only after :dbcommand:`movePrimary` 
   has been run.

   .. seealso::

      For when and why :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` is run, see 
      **Considerations** on the :dbcommand:`movePrimary` page.

   .. warning::

      Do not modify the routing table data except when it is 
      explicitly documented.

   :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` is an administrative command that is
   only available for :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

   To run the command, you must issue the command against the ``admin``
   database:

   .. example::

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.adminCommand("flushRouterConfig")
