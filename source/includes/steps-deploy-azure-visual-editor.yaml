  In the :guilabel:`Configure Azure Blob Storage` page, you must
  configure |azure| Storage Account credential delegation and Storage
  Container access. To do these: 

  a. Enter your Storage Account Resource ID in the :guilabel:`Storage
     Account Credential Delegation` field.

     To learn more, see `Get the resource ID for a storage account
     <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-get-info?tabs=portal>`__. 

  #. Copy and run the command from the :guilabel:`Storage Account
     Credential Delegation` step in your |azure| PowerShell 
     to set up the credentials delegation. 

  #. Specify whether the storage container allows :guilabel:`Read only`
     or :guilabel:`Read and write` operations.

     |service| can only query :guilabel:`Read-only` containers; if you 
     wish to query and save query results to your {+az-bs+} container,
     choose :guilabel:`Read and write`.

     {+adf+} doesn't support writes to your {+az-bs+} container using
     :ref:`adf-out-stage`. 

  #. Enter your Storage Container name.
  
  #. Copy and run the command shown from the :guilabel:`Storage
     Container Access` step in your |azure| PowerShell to set up blob
     container access. 

  #. Click :guilabel:`Continue`.

     To add additional paths to data on your {+az-bs+} container, click 
     :guilabel:`Add Data Source` and enter the path. To learn more about 
     paths, see :ref:`adf-path-syntax`.

     |json| configuration setting.

  #. **Optional**. Specify the partition fields that {+df+} should use
     when searching the files in the {+az-bs+} container and the field
     value type. 
     
     If omitted, {+df+} does a recursive search for all files from the
     root of the {+az-bs+} container. If you don't select a specific field
     value type, {+df+} adds any value in that path in all queries.

     Corresponds to :datalakeconf-azure:`stores.[n].prefix` and
     :datalakeconf-azure:`databases.[n].collections.[n].dataSources.[n].path`
     |json| configuration settings.
