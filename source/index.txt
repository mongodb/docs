.. admonition:: What's New in |service|
   :class: note

   - Updates to the UI design.

   - Separation of group-level and user-level settings.

     The :guilabel:`Settings` view in the left-hand navigation bar now
     contains only the group-level settings. To access user-specific
     settings, click on your user name in the upper-right hand corner
     and select :guilabel:`Account`.

   - The :guilabel:`Users` view (i.e. |service| users who belong to the
     group, i.e. not the MongoDB users) is now available directly from
     the left-hand navigation bar.

   - Group Name Improvements:

     - Remove restriction that required a globally unique Group Name.

     - Ability to :doc:`rename Group <group-settings>` by the Group owner.

   - |service| Free Tier. See :doc:`/create-new-cluster` for details.

   `Tutorial Series [Video]: Getting Started with MongoDB Atlas
   <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4RCxklHWZ9tr6Tlj8x6jtSO97d1044mf>`_

`MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com?jmp=docs>`_ is a cloud
service for running, monitoring, and maintaining MongoDB deployments,
including the provisioning of dedicated servers for the MongoDB
instances. In addition, |service| provides the ability to
:doc:`introspect collections <data-explorer>`, :doc:`query backups
<query-backup>`, and :doc:`migrate data from existing MongoDB replica
set </import/live-import>` into an |service| cluster.

MongoDB Deployments
-------------------

MongoDB deployments, or "clusters" in |service|, can be either a
:term:`replica set` or a :term:`sharded cluster`.

MongoDB Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-mongodb-version.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-auto-index.rst

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

|service| deploys each cluster across :doc:`availability zones
</reference/amazon-aws>` and with mandatory :ref:`security
<overview-security>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-aws-instance.rst

|service| Group
---------------

Your |service| group manages your MongoDB deployments. An |service|
group can have multiple MongoDB clusters.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-vpc-per-group.rst

.. _overview-security:

Security
--------

|service| secures your deployments through the use of :ref:`TLS/SSL
<security-tls>`, :ref:`virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet
<security-vpc>` with :ref:`IP whitelists <add-to-whitelist>`, and
:ref:`user authentication and authorization <mongodb-users>`.

Support
-------

|service| provides support for the use of the service itself. Support
for development and performance of the database itself requires a
MongoDB subscription. For details, `contact MongoDB Inc.
<https://www.mongodb.com/contact?jmp=docs>`_.
