Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to build a {+qe+} enabled
application using Amazon Web Services (AWS) {+kms-abbr+}.

After you complete the steps in this guide, you should have:

- A {+cmk-long+} hosted on an AWS KMS instance.
- A working client application that inserts encrypted documents
  using your {+cmk-long+}.
