.. _sca-changes:

Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) Changes
--------------------------------------------

|sca| is a new European regulatory requirement to reduce fraud and make
online payments more secure. All payment service providers are required
to build additional authentication into their checkout flow once |sca|
goes into effect. Customers in
`European Economic Area (EEA) <https://www.efta.int/eea>`__ may be
required to authenticate their credit cards depending on the card's
issuer, starting 14 September 2019. If your credit card issuer
requires authentication, review the following :ref:`sca-auth-process`
to continue paying for |service-fullname| seamlessly with a credit
card.

Marketing emails will be sent out to affected customers announcing the
policy change and the steps necessary to comply with |sca|.

.. _sca-auth-process:

Authentication Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections cover different ways to authenticate your credit
card to comply with Strong Customer Authentication.

Deploy a Paid Database as a New User
````````````````````````````````````

New |service| users who do not have a payment method saved can
authenticate a new credit card when paying for a {+database-deployment+} on 
the :guilabel:`Create a Database Deployment` page. To learn more, see
:ref:`create-new-database-deployment`.

Edit Payment Method
```````````````````

Existing users can edit their :guilabel:`Payment Method` to
authenticate a new credit card or reauthenticate an existing credit
card to comply with |sca|:

.. include:: /includes/steps/billing-payments-edit.rst

Once you update your credit card information and authenticate, you will
be automatically charged for all existing failed payments.

Failed Payment Email
````````````````````

|service| sends an email after a payment failure with a link to your
invoices. Existing users can authenticate a credit card when retrying a
failed payment. To retry the failed payment from the failed payment
email:

.. include:: /includes/steps/billing-payments-retry-from-email.rst

Retry Failed Payment

Existing users can authenticate a credit card when retrying a failed
payment. To retry the failed payment from within |service|:
