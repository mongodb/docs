Definition
----------

.. expression:: knnBeta 

   The ``knnBeta`` operator uses |hnsw| algorithm to perform semantic 
   search. You can use |fts| support for :abbr:`kNN (K-nearest 
   neighbors)` query to search similar to a selected product, search 
   for images, etc.

.. _knn-beta-syntax:

Syntax 
------

``knnBeta`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

   {
     $search: {
       "index": "<index name>", // optional, defaults to "default"
       "knnBeta": {
         "vector": [<array-of-numbers>],
         "path": "<field-to-search>",
         "filter": {<filter-specification>},
         "k": <number>,
         "score": {<options>}
       }
     }
   }

.. _knn-beta-options:

Options 
-------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 60 10 

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Necessity

   * - ``filter``
     - document
     - Any |fts| :ref:`operator <operators-ref>` to filter the 
       documents based on metadata or certain search criteria, which 
       can help narrow down the scope of vector search.
     - Optional

   * - ``k``
     - number
     - Number of nearest neighbors to return. You can specify a number 
       higher than the number of documents to return 
       (:pipeline:`$limit`) to increase accuracy. 
     - Required

   * - ``path``
     - string
     - Indexed :ref:`bson-data-types-knn-vector` type field to search. 
       See :ref:`Path Construction <ref-path>` for more information.
     - Required

   * - ``vector``
     - array of numbers
     - Array of numbers of |bson| types ``int`` or ``double`` that 
       represent the query vector. The array size must match the number 
       of vector ``dimensions`` specified in the :ref:`index 
       <bson-data-types-knn-vector>` for the field.
     - Required

.. _knn-beta-behavior:

Behavior 
--------

You can run :abbr:`kNN (K-nearest neighbors)` queries against fields 
that were indexed as |fts| type :ref:`bson-data-types-knn-vector` only.

You can use :pipeline:`$skip` and :pipeline:`$limit` after the 
:pipeline:`$search` stage to paginate the ``knnBeta`` query results. 
However, the value that you specify for ``k`` must be greater than or 
equal to the sum of the numbers you specify for :pipeline:`$skip` and 
:pipeline:`$limit`. 

.. example:: 

   The following query finds ``150`` nearest neighbors to the query, 
   skips the first ``100`` results, and limits the remaining number of 
   results to ``50``. 

   .. code-block:: json 
      :copyable: false 
      :linenos:

      db.<collection>.aggregate({
        "$search": {
          "knnBeta": {
            "vector": <array-of-numbers-to-search>,
            "path": <indexed-field-to-search>,
            "k": 150
          }
        } 
      },
      {
        "$skip": 100
      },
      {
        "$limit": 50
      })

   For the preceding query, the value of ``k`` (on line 6) shouldn't be 
   less than the sum of the number of documents skipped (on line 11), 
   which is ``100``, and the number of documents returned (on line 14), 
   which is ``50``.

.. _knn-beta-usage:

Usage 
~~~~~

You can use ``knnBeta`` within the :ref:`compound-ref` operator to 
perform a hybrid of keyword search and semantic search. ``knnBeta`` 
always returns only ``k`` results, which is the number of nearest 
neighbors. Therefore, if you use ``knnBeta`` inside the 
:ref:`compound-ref` operator ``must`` clause with other operators, 
|fts| uses the other operators for post-filtering of the semantic 
search results. For pre-filtering, you can use the ``filter`` option 
inside ``knnBeta``. On sharded clusters, |fts| returns ``k`` results 
from each shard, but you can use :pipeline:`$limit` to limit the total 
number of results.

|fts| scores the results for :abbr:`kNN (K-nearest neighbors)` queries 
in a fixed range from ``0`` to ``1`` only. You can customize the 
default score for your keyword and semantic subqueries using 
:ref:`scoring-boost` and other :ref:`scoring options <scoring-ref>`. 

.. _knn-beta-egs:

Examples 
--------

The following queries search the sample ``cheese_varieties`` collection 
using the ``knnVector`` operator. If you added the sample collection to 
a database on your |service| cluster and created the :ref:`sample index 
definition <knn-vector-egs>` for the collection, you can switch to the 
database where you added this collection and run the following queries 
against the collection. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Basic Example 
      :tabid: basic 

      The following query searches the ``egVector`` field using the 
      ``knnVector`` operator for ``vector`` dimensions and requests up 
      to ``3`` nearest neighbors in the results.

      The following query filters the documents for cheese produced 
      before or in (``≤``) the year ``2021``, then searches the 
      ``egVector`` field in the filtered documents for ``vector`` 
      dimensions, and requests up to ``3`` nearest neighbors in the 
      results. The query also specifies a :pipeline:`$project` stage 
      to: 

      - Exclude all fields except ``name``, ``egVector``, 
        ``yearProduced``, and ``_id`` in the results.
      - Add a field named ``score`` in the results.

            ]

      |fts| filters the documents based on the ``yearProduced`` field 
      value that is lesser than or equals to ``2021``. It scores 
      document with ``"_id": 2`` higher because it matches the search 
      criteria in the ``filter`` option and also the ``vector`` 
      dimensions in the query.

   .. tab:: Compound Example 
      :tabid: compound

      The following query uses the :ref:`compound-ref` operator to run 
      subqueries using the ``knnVector`` and ``text`` operators. The 
      query uses the ``should`` clause to search the following fields:
      
      - ``egVector`` field for ``vector`` dimensions and requests up to 
        ``3`` nearest neighbors in the results.
      - ``countryOfOrigin`` field for the term ``italy``.
      
      The query also specifies a :pipeline:`$project` stage 
      to: 

      - Exclude all fields except ``name``, ``description``, 
        ``egVector``, ``countryOfOrigin``, and ``_id`` in the results.
      - Add a field named ``score`` in the results.
