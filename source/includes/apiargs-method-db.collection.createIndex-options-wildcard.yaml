  Allows users to include or exclude specific field paths from
  a :ref:`wildcard index <wildcard-index-core>` using the
  ``{ "$**" : 1}`` key pattern. This option is only 
  valid if creating a :ref:`wildcard index <wildcard-index-core>` on
  all document fields. You cannot specify this option if creating
  a wildcard index on a specific field path and its subfields, e.g.
  ``{ "path.to.field.$**" : 1 }``

  The ``wildcardProjection`` option takes the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     wildcardProjection: {
       "path.to.field.a" : <value>,
       "path.to.field.b" : <value>
     }

  The ``<value>`` can be either of the following:

  - ``1`` or ``true`` to include the field in the wildcard index.

  - ``0`` or ``false`` to exclude the field from the wildcard index. 

  A ``wildcardProjection`` *cannot* contain *both* include and exclude
  specifications, with the exception of including the ``_id`` field
  while excluding other fields.
