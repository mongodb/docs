.. _restore-access-google-accounts:

How do I restore lost access to organizations and projects?
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you created your |service| account using a Gmail or Google Apps
account, the following can cause you to lose access to your
organizations and projects:

- The Google email address with which you signed up differs from the
  email address associated to your account. This is most often the case
  with Gmail or Google Apps aliases.
- Your username or email domain has changed in Google Apps.

To re-gain access to your organizations and projects:

- Ask |a-service| user with the :authrole:`Organization Owner` to
  invite you to the organization to which you lost access, or
- Contact |mdb-support|.

You can remove a project if:

- You have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role for the project.

- The project has no outstanding invoices.

- The project has no active {+database-deployments+}.

To delete a project for an organization, you can delete from the
organization's :guilabel:`Projects` view or the project's
:guilabel:`Project Setting` view. For details, see 
:ref:`delete-project`.

How do I delete my |service| account?
-------------------------------------

To delete your |service| account, see :ref:`delete-atlas-account`.

.. note::

   |service| requires a few business days to fully process an account deletion. 
   Until then, you can't create a new |service| account with the email address 
   associated with your deleted account.
