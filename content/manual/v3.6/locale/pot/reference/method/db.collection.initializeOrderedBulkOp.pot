msgid "Execution of Operations"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-bulk-operation-ordered-list.rst:1
msgid "When executing an :method:`ordered <db.collection.initializeOrderedBulkOp()>` list of operations, MongoDB groups the operations by the :data:`operation type <batchType>` and contiguity; i.e. *contiguous* operations of the same type are grouped together. For example, if an ordered list has two insert operations followed by an update operation followed by another insert operation, MongoDB groups the operations into three separate groups: first group contains the two insert operations, second group contains the update operation, and the third group contains the last insert operation. This behavior is subject to change in future versions."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-bulk-operation-batches.rst:1
msgid "Each group of operations can have at most :limit:`1000 operations <Write Command Operation Limit Size>`. If a group exceeds this :limit:`limit <Write Command Operation Limit Size>`, MongoDB will divide the group into smaller groups of 1000 or less. For example, if the bulk operations list consists of 2000 insert operations, MongoDB creates 2 groups, each with 1000 operations."

msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-bulk-operation-sharded-cluster.rst:1
msgid "Executing an :method:`ordered <db.collection.initializeOrderedBulkOp()>` list of operations on a sharded collection will generally be slower than executing an :method:`unordered <db.collection.initializeUnorderedBulkOp()>` list since with an ordered list, each operation must wait for the previous operation to finish."
