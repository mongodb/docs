Config servers store the metadata for a :term:`sharded cluster`. The metadata
reflects state and organization for all data and components within the
sharded cluster. The metadata includes the list of chunks on every shard and
the ranges that define the chunks.

The :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances cache this data and use it to route
read and write operations to the correct shards. :binary:`~bin.mongos`
updates the cache when there are metadata changes for the cluster, such
as :ref:`adding a shard <sharding-procedure-add-shard>`. Shards also read 
chunk metadata from the config servers.

The config servers also store :ref:`authentication` configuration
information such as :ref:`Role-Based Access
Control <authorization>` or :ref:`internal
authentication <replica-set-security>` settings for the cluster.

MongoDB also uses the config servers to manage distributed locks.

Each sharded cluster must have its own config servers. Do not use the
same config servers for different sharded clusters.

.. warning::

   Administrative operations conducted on config servers may have significant
   impact on sharded cluster performance and availability. Depending on the
   number of config servers impacted, the cluster may be read-only or
   offline for a period of time.

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, you can configure a config server to store
application data in addition to the usual sharded cluster metadata. The
config server is then known as a *config shard*. You'll learn more later
on this page in the :ref:`sharded-cluster-config-server-config-shards`
section.

Replica Set Config Servers
--------------------------

.. _config-server-read-write-ops:

Read and Write Operations on Config Servers
-------------------------------------------

The ``admin`` database and the ``config`` database exist on the config 
servers.

Writes to Config Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``admin`` database contains the collections related to the
authentication and authorization as well as the other :ref:`system.*
collections <metadata-system-collections>` for internal use.

The ``config`` database contains the
collections that contain the sharded cluster metadata. MongoDB writes
data to the ``config`` database when the metadata changes, such as after 
a :ref:`chunk migration <sharding-balancing>` or a :ref:`chunk split
<sharding-data-partitioning>`.

Users should avoid writing directly to the config database in the
course of normal operation or maintenance.

When writing to the config servers, MongoDB uses a :ref:`write concern
<wc-w>` of ``"majority"``.

Reads from Config Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB reads from the ``admin`` database for authentication and
authorization data and other internal uses.

MongoDB reads from the ``config`` database when a :binary:`~bin.mongos`
starts or after a change in the metadata, such as after a chunk
migration. Shards also read chunk metadata from the config servers.

When reading from the replica set config servers, MongoDB uses a
:ref:`<read-concern>` level of :readconcern:`"majority"`.

Metadata Views Must be Up-to-Date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/sharded-cluster-metadata-up-to-date.rst

.. _config-server-availability:

Config Server Availability
--------------------------

If the config server replica set loses its primary and cannot elect a
primary, the cluster's metadata becomes *read only*. You can still read
and write data from the shards, but no chunk migration or chunk splits
will occur until the replica set can elect a primary. 

In a sharded cluster, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances
monitor the replica sets in the sharded cluster (e.g. shard replica
sets, config server replica set).

If all config servers become unavailable, the cluster can become
inoperable. To ensure that the config servers remain available and
intact, backups of config servers are critical. The data on the config
server is small compared to the data stored in a cluster, and the
config server has a relatively low activity load.

See :ref:`sharding-config-servers-and-availability` for more
information.

.. _sharding-internals-config-database:

Sharded Cluster Metadata
------------------------

Config servers store metadata in the ``config`` database.

.. important::

   Always back up the ``config`` database before doing any
   maintenance on the config server.

To access the ``config`` database, issue the following command in
:binary:`~bin.mongosh`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use config

In general, you should *never* edit the content of the ``config``
database directly. The ``config`` database contains the following
collections:

- :data:`~config.changelog`
- :data:`~config.chunks`
- :data:`~config.collections`
- :data:`~config.databases`
- :data:`csrs.indexes <config.csrs.indexes>`
- :data:`~config.mongos`
- :data:`~config.settings`
- :data:`~config.shards`
- :data:`~config.version`

For more information on these collections and their role in sharded
clusters, see :ref:`<config-database>`. See
:ref:`config-server-read-write-ops` for more information about reads
and updates to the metadata.

Sharded Cluster Security
------------------------

Use :ref:`<inter-process-auth>` to enforce intra-cluster
security and prevent unauthorized cluster components from accessing the
cluster. You must start each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the cluster with the
appropriate security settings in order to enforce internal authentication.

.. include:: /includes/intra-cluster-authentication.rst

See :ref:`<deploy-cluster-with-keyfile-auth>` for a tutorial on 
deploying a secured sharded cluster.

.. _sharded-cluster-config-server-config-shards:

Config Shards
-------------

.. include:: /includes/config-shard-introduction.rst

You cannot use the same config shard for multiple sharded clusters.

Commands
~~~~~~~~

To configure a dedicated config server to run as a config shard, run the
:dbcommand:`transitionFromDedicatedConfigServer` command. 

To configure a config shard to run as a dedicated config server, run the
:dbcommand:`transitionToDedicatedConfigServer` command.

Users
~~~~~

A user created on a config shard has the same behavior as a user created
on a dedicated config server.
