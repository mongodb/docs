Two-Factor Authentication
-------------------------

Missed |sms| Authentication Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Use Authenticator Apps When Possible

   Authenticator applications are the preferred method to |sms| for
   two-factor authentication. |sms| is an older protocol with many
   known security vulnerabilities. The U.S.
   :abbr:`NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology)`
   advised abandoning |sms| for |2fa| in section `5.1.3.2`_ of its
   `Digital Identity Guidelines`_.

If are using |sms|, but do not receive the authentication tokens via
|sms|:

1. Refer to the :doc:`/core/two-factor-authentication`
   page for more details about using two-factor authentication. This
   page includes any limitations which may affect |sms| delivery times.

2. Enter the |sms| phone number with country code first followed by the
   area code and the phone number.

   If you are outside of the United States or Canada, include ``011``
   and the `country code <https://countrycode.org/>`__  because |mms|
   uses the U.S.-based `Twilio <https://www.twilio.com>`_ to send text
   messages. As an alternative to your non-U.S. telephone number, use
   a `Google Voice <https://voice.google.com>`__ telephone number.

   .. example::

      For New Zealand enter ``01164`` before the phone number. 

   If you do not receive the authentication token in a reasonable
   amount of time `contact Support <https://cloud.mongodb.com/links/support>`_
   to rule out |sms| message delivery delays.

   .. seealso::

      To learn more about limits of |sms| for |2fa|, see 
      :ref:`SMS delivery considerations <sms-delivery-considerations>`.

Delete or Reset Two-Factor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete or reset two-factor authentication, go to
`<https://account.mongodb.com/account/reset/mfa/cloud>`__.
The reset button deletes your existing two-factor authentication
settings and provides the option to create new ones.

Restore Lost Access to Organizations and Projects
-------------------------------------------------

If you created your |mms| account using a Gmail or Google Apps
account, the following can cause you to lose access to your
organizations and projects:

- The Google email address with which you signed up differs from the
  email address associated to your account. This is most often the
  case with Gmail or Google Apps aliases.
- Your username or email domain has changed in Google Apps.

To re-gain access to your organizations and projects:

- Ask a user with the :authrole:`Organization Owner` to invite you 
  to the organization to which you lost access, or
- :website:`Contact MongoDB Support </contact>`.
