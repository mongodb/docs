Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to configure the driver logger which is responsible
for reporting events that occur while your application is running. You can
set the logger level, specify logging settings for individual classes, and
provide a custom logger implementation.

You should read this guide if you need to customize the default behavior of the
driver logger or want to explore the information provided by the logger.

Log Levels
----------

You can configure the driver to report logger messages at three different
levels as shown in the following table.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Logger Level
     - Description

   * - ``debug``
     - The most verbose logger level which shows all logger messages reported
       by the driver including those reported in the ``info`` and ``error``
       levels.

   * - ``info``
     - Include informational messages reported by the driver including those
       reported in the ``error`` level.

   * - ``error``
     - Only include error messages reported by the driver. This is the default
       setting.

The following example demonstrates how to set the logger to the ``debug``
level:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/logging/levels.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: begin-ex
   :end-before: end-ex
   :dedent: 4

This snippet should output a few lines of logging information that
resemble the following:

.. code-block:: none

   [DEBUG-Db:63846] 1585699200000 executing command {"isMaster":true} against sample_mflix.$cmd with options [{"readPreference":{"mode":"primary"}}] {
     type: 'debug',
     message: 'executing command {"isMaster":true} against sample_mflix.$cmd with options [{"readPreference":{"mode":"primary"}}]',
     className: 'Db',
     ...,
   }
   [DEBUG-Server:63846] 1585699200000 executing command [{"ns":"sample_mflix.$cmd","cmd":{"isMaster":true},"options":{}}] against myClusterHostname:27017:27017 {
     ...
   }
   [DEBUG-Server:63846] 11585699200000 executing command
   [{"ns":"admin.$cmd","cmd":{"endSessions":[{"id":"DQLUQ1/LRKOYMy2CD13iLQ=="}]},"options":{}}] against myClusterHostname:27017 {
     ...
   }


Filter on a Specific Class
--------------------------

You can set the Logger to only produce log messages generated by specific
classes by defining a filter on it. The following example demonstrates how to
apply a filter to log messages from the ``Db`` class only.

.. code-block:: js

     // Set debug level
     Logger.setLevel("debug");

     // Only log statements on "Db" class
     Logger.filter("class", ["Db"]);

     const db = client.db("sample_mflix");

     // Execute command { isMaster: true } against db
     await db.command({ isMaster: true });
   }

The logger output of the code above is similar to the prior example, but
excludes logging from classes other than ``Db`` such as ``Server`` and
resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none

   [DEBUG-Db:63846] 1585699200000 executing command {"isMaster":true} against sample_mflix.$cmd with options [{"readPreference":{"mode":"primary"}}] {
     type: 'debug',
     message: 'executing command {"isMaster":true} against sample_mflix.$cmd with options [{"readPreference":{"mode":"primary"}}]',
     className: 'Db',
     ...

You can specify any number of the following driver classes in the logging
filter array to control what information is passed to the Logger:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Class name
     - Description

   * - ``Db``
     - Information related to calls on a db instance

   * - ``Server``
     - Information related to a server instance (standalone instance,
       ``mongos`` instance, or replica set member).

   * - ``ReplSet``
     - Information related to a replica set.

   * - ``Mongos``
     - Information related to a ``mongos`` instance.

   * - ``Cursor``
     - Information related to a cursor.

   * - ``Pool``
     - Information related to a connection pool.

   * - ``Connection``
     - Information related to a single-instance connection.

   * - ``Ping``
     - Information related to a replica set ping operation.

You can add your own classes to the logger by creating your own logger
instances as shown in the following sample code.

.. code-block:: js

   const { Logger } = require("mongodb");

   class A {
     constructor() {
       this.logger = new Logger("A");
     }

     doSomething() {
       if (this.logger.isInfo()) {
         this.logger.info("logging A", {});
       }
     }
   }

   // Execute A to produce logging messages
   const a = new A();
   a.doSomething();

The logging message is triggered when ``doSomething()`` is called and is
presented in the following format:

.. code-block:: none

   [INFO-A:65156] 1585699200000 logging A {
     type: 'info',
     message: 'logging A',
     className: 'A',
     ...
   }


Custom Logger
-------------

You can configure the behavior and format of the messages reported by the
logger by passing in a **logger callback function** which allows you
to access and modify the message and metadata of the logger message.

The following example demonstrates how to define a logger callback
function and add custom logic to it.

.. code-block:: js

   // Set debug level
   Logger.setLevel("debug");

   // Set our own logger
   Logger.setCurrentLogger((msg, context) => {
     // Add your custom logic here
     context['foo'] = 'bar';
     msg = "Hello, World! " + msg;

     console.log(msg, context);
   });

   const db = client.db("sample_mflix");

   // Run a command to produce logger messages
   await db.command({ isMaster: true });

The code example above adds additional information in the callback function.
The output of the example resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none

   Hello, World! [DEBUG-Db:65873] 1585699200000 executing command {"isMaster":true} against sample_mflix.$cmd with options [{"readPreference":{"mode":"primary"}}] {
     type: 'debug',
     message: 'executing command {"isMaster":true} against sample_mflix.$cmd with options [{"readPreference":{"mode":"primary"}}]',
     className: 'Db',
     foo: 'bar',
     ...
   }

:node-api:`Logger API documentation <Logger.html>`.
