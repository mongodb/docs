Log Forwarder Configuration Files
=================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You define log forwarder configuration files in the ``/log_forwarders``
directory.

.. code-block:: none
   
   app/
   └── log_forwarders/
       └── <Name>.json

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: log_forwarders/<name>.json
   
   {
     "name": "<name>",
     "log_types": [ "<type>", ... ],
     "log_statuses": [ "<status>", ... ],
     "policy": { batching policy },
     "action": { action configuration }
   }

   * - Field
     - Description
    
   * - | ``name``
       | ``string``
     - A unique name for the log forwarder.
    
   * - | ``log_types``
       | ``string[]``
     - An array of one or more log types that the forwarder should
       send to a service. Atlas App Services only forwards a log if its type is
       listed *and* its status is listed in ``log_statuses``.

       The array may contain the following log types:

       .. include:: /includes/log-forwarder-types.rst
    
   * - | ``log_statuses``
       | ``string[]``
     - An array of one or more log statuses that the forwarder should
       send to a service. App Services only forwards a log if its type is
       listed *and* its type is listed in ``log_types``.

       The array may contain the following log statuses:
       
       .. include:: /includes/log-forwarder-statuses.rst
    
   * - | ``policy``
       | ``object``
     - An object that configures the forwarder's batching policy.
       
       To forward logs individually:
       
       .. code-block:: json
          
          { "type": "single" }
       
       To group logs into batches:
       
       .. code-block:: json
          
          { "type": "batch" }
    
   * - | ``action``
       | ``object``
     - An object that configures where and how the forwarder sends logs.
       
       To forward logs to a linked MongoDB collection:
       
       .. code-block:: json

          {
            "type": "collection",
            "data_source": "<data source name>",
            "database": "<database name>",
            "collection": "<collection name>"
          }
       
       To forward logs with a custom function:
       
       .. code-block:: json
          
          {
            "type": "function",
            "name": "<function name>"
          }
