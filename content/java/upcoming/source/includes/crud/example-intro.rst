.. note:: Example Setup

    This example connects to an instance of MongoDB by using a
    connection URI. To learn more about connecting to your MongoDB
    instance, see the :ref:`java-connect-to-mongodb` guide. This example
    also uses the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database
    included in the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. You
    can load them into your database on the free tier of MongoDB Atlas
    by following the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas Guide
    </getting-started/#atlas-getting-started>`.
