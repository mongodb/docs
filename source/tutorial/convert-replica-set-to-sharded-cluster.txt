|mms| provides the ability to convert a :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` to
a :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/convert-replica-set-to-sharded-cluster.rst

After you convert a replica set to a sharded cluster, you can enable
sharding for a database and shard collections.

To learn how to shard collections, see :manual:`Shard a Collection </tutorial/convert-replica-set-to-replicated-shard-cluster/#10.-shard-a-collection>`.

If you need to add additional shards to support greater capacity, click
on the wrench menu for the sharded cluster to create additional shards.

.. note:: Effects on Backup after Converting

   The converted shard (original replica set) has:

   - Backup enabled
   - Previous snapshots retained
   - Ability to restore snapshots to this shard only

   After converting, you should
   :doc:`enable Backup </tutorial/enable-backup>` for the entire
   sharded cluster. On databases running MongoDB
   :manual:`FCV </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`
   4.0 or earlier, activating Backup causes |mms| to start an initial
   sync on the config servers and the converted shard. Restores to the
   entire sharded cluster should use snapshots taken after conversion
   only.
