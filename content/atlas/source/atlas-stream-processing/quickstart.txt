This tutorial takes you through the steps of setting up {+atlas-sp+}
and running your first stream processor.

.. _atlas-sp-tutorial-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial you need:

- An {+service+} project with an empty cluster. This cluster serves as
  the data sink for your stream processor.

- A database user with the  :atlasrole:`atlasAdmin` role to create
  and run stream processors

- An {+service+} user with the  :authrole:`Project Owner` or
  the :authrole:`Project Stream Processing Owner` role to manage a
  {+SPW+} and Connection Registry

  .. note::
     
     The :authrole:`Project Owner` role allows you to create database 
     deployments, manage project access and project settings, manage 
     IP Access List entries, and more.

     The :authrole:`Project Stream Processing Owner` role enables 
     {+atlas-sp+} actions such as viewing, creating, deleting, and 
     editing {+spw+}s, and viewing, adding, modifying, 
     and deleting connections in the connection registry. 

     See :ref:`Project Roles <project-roles>` to learn more about the 
     differences between the two roles.

.. _atlas-sp-tutorial-procedure:

Procedure
---------

This tutorial guides you through creating an {+spw+},
connecting it to an existing {+service+} cluster, and setting up a
stream processor to ingest sample data from solar streaming devices and
write the data to your connected cluster.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create a {+SPW+}.

      a. .. include:: /includes/nav/list-stream-processing.rst

      #. Click :guilabel:`Create a workspace`. 

      #. On the :guilabel:`Create a stream processing workspace` 
         page, configure your workspace as follows:

         - :guilabel:`Tier`: ``SP30``
         - :guilabel:`Provider`: ``AWS``
         - :guilabel:`Region`: ``us-east-1``
         - :guilabel:`Workspace Name`: ``tutorialWorkspace``

      #. Click :guilabel:`Create`.

   .. step:: Add a sink connection to the connection registry.

      Add a connection to an existing empty {+service+} cluster to your
      connection registry. Your stream processor will use this
      connection as a streaming data sink.

      a. In the pane for your {+spw+}, click :guilabel:`Manage`.

      #. In the :guilabel:`Connection Registry` tab, click
         :guilabel:`+ Add Connection` in the upper right.

      #. From the :guilabel:`Connection Type` drop-down list, click
         :guilabel:`Atlas Database`.
      
      #. In the :guilabel:`Connection Name` field, enter ``mongodb1``.

      #. From the :guilabel:`Atlas Cluster` drop-down list, select an
         {+service+} cluster without any data stored on it.

      #. From the :guilabel:`Execute as` drop-down list, select
         :guilabel:`Read and write to any database`. 

      #. Click :guilabel:`Add connection`.

   .. step:: Verify that your streaming data source emits messages.

      Your {+spw+} comes preconfigured with a connection to a sample
      data source called ``sample_stream_solar``. This source
      generates a stream of reports from various solar power
      devices. Each report describes the observed wattage and
      temperature of a single solar device at a specific point in
      time, as well as that device's maximum wattage. 
      
      The following document represents a report from this data source:
      
      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: true

         {
           device_id: 'device_8',
           group_id: 7,
           timestamp: '2024-08-12T21:41:01.788+00:00',
           max_watts: 450,
           event_type: 0,
           obs: {
             watts: 252,
             temp: 17
           }
         }

      To verify that this source emits messages, create a stream
      processor interactively using {+mongosh+}: 

      a. Connect to your {+spw+}.

         Use the connection string associated with your {+spw+}
         to connect using {+mongosh+}.

         i. In the pane for your {+spw+}, click :guilabel:`Connect`.

         #. In the workspace connection dialog, click
            :guilabel:`Choose a connection method`, then
            select the :guilabel:`Shell` tab.

         #. Copy the connection string displayed in the dialog. It has
            the following format, where
            ``<atlas-stream-processing-url>`` is the URL of your {+spw+}
            and ``<username>`` is the username of a database user with
            the :atlasrole:`atlasAdmin` role:

            .. code-block:: sh

               mongosh "mongodb://<atlas-stream-processing-url>/" 
               --tls --authenticationDatabase admin --username <username>  
               --password <password>   

         #. Paste the connection string into your terminal and replace
            the ``<password>`` placeholder with the credentials for the
            user. 
            
            Press Enter to run it and connect to your {+spw+}.

      #. In the {+mongosh+} prompt, use the :method:`sp.process()`
         method to create the stream processor interactively. 

         .. code-block::
            :copyable: true

            sp.process([{"$source": {
               "connectionName": "sample_stream_solar"
            }}])

         Verify that data from the ``sample_stream_solar`` 
         connection displays to the console, and terminate 
         the process.

         Stream processors you create with ``sp.process()`` don't
         persist after you terminate them.

   .. step:: Create a persistent stream processor.

      A persistent stream processor continuously ingests, processes, and
      writes streaming data to a specified data sink until you drop the
      processor. The following stream processor is an :ref:`aggregation
      pipeline <aggregation-pipeline-intro>` that derives the maximum
      temperature and the average, maximum, and minimum wattages
      of each solar device across 10-second intervals, then writes the
      results to your connected empty cluster.

      Select one of the following tabs to create a stream processor
      using the {+atlas-ui+} or {+mongosh+}:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
            :tabid: atlas-ui 

            .. include:: /atlas-stream-processing/steps-getting-started-create-stream-processor-ui.rst

         .. tab:: {+mongosh+}
            :tabid: mongosh

            .. include:: /atlas-stream-processing/steps-getting-started-create-stream-processor-mongosh.rst

   .. step:: Start the stream processor. 

      .. tabs:: 
         
         .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
            :tabid: atlas-ui 

            In the list of stream processors for your {+spw+}, click the
            :guilabel:`Start` icon for your stream processor.

         .. tab:: {+mongosh+}
            :tabid: mongosh

            Use the :method:`sp.processor.start()` method in {+mongosh+}:

            .. code-block:: sh

               sp.solarDemo.start()

   .. step:: Verify the output of the stream processor.

      .. tabs:: 
         
         .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
            :tabid: atlas-ui 

            To verify that the stream processor is writing data to your
            {+service+} cluster:

            a. .. include:: /includes/nav/list-db-deployments-page.rst
            
            #. .. include:: /includes/nav/list-data-explorer.rst

            #. View the ``MySolar`` collection.

         .. tab:: {+mongosh+}
            :tabid: mongosh

            To verify that the processor is active, use the
            :method:`sp.processor.stats()` method in {+mongosh+}:

            .. code-block:: sh
               :copyable: true

               sp.solarDemo.stats()

            This method reports operational statistics of the 
            ``solarDemo`` stream processor. 

            You can also use the :method:`sp.processor.sample()` method
            in {+mongosh+} to return a sampling of processed documents
            in the terminal.

            .. io-code-block:: 
                :copyable: 
               
                .. input:: 
                   :language: shell
                   
                   sp.solarDemo.sample()

                .. output:: 
               	   :language: json
                   :visible: false
                   
                   {
                     _id: 10,
                     max_temp: 16,
                     avg_watts: 232,
                     max_watts: 414,
                     min_watts: 73
                   }

            .. note::

               The preceding output is a representative example. Streaming
               data are not static, and each user sees distinct
               documents.

   .. step:: Drop the stream processor.

      .. tabs:: 
         
         .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
            :tabid: atlas-ui 

            In the list of stream processors for your {+spw+}, click the
            :guilabel:`Delete` (:icon:`trash-alt`) icon for your stream
            processor. 

            In the confirmation dialog that appears, type the name of the
            stream processor (``solarDemo``) to confirm that you want to
            delete it, and then click :guilabel:`Delete`.

         .. tab:: {+mongosh+}
            :tabid: mongosh

            Use the :method:`sp.processor.drop()` method in {+mongosh+} to
            drop ``solarDemo``:

            .. code-block:: sh
               :copyable: true

               sp.solarDemo.drop()

            To confirm that you have dropped ``solarDemo``, use the
            :method:`sp.listStreamProcessors()` method to list all your
            available stream processors:

            .. code-block:: sh
               :copyable: true

               sp.listStreamProcessors()
