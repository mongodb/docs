Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: logout

   .. deprecated:: 5.0

   If you enabled auditing, an attempt to use the :dbcommand:`logout`
   command will create an entry in the audit log.
   
   This command will be removed in a future release.   

   .. note::

      This command was used when you could log in as multiple users on a
      single logical connection. Because this is no longer possible,
      running ``logout`` is no longer supported. Going forward, you can
      achieve the same results by closing your connection.  

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      { 
        logout: 1 
      }
   )


Example
-------

.. |operation-name| replace:: :dbcommand:`logout`
.. include:: /includes/note-logout-namespace.rst

.. example::

  .. include:: /includes/fact-change-database-context.rst

  When you have set the database context and ``db`` object, you
  can use the |operation-name| to log out of database as in the
  following operation:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { logout: 1 } )
