.. important:: Live Migration (push) Deprecated or Not Supported for Deployments Managed or Monitored by |onprem|

   - For source deployments running MongoDB {+c2c-version+} or later, where the deployments are
     managed or monitored by |onprem|, live migration (push) is not supported.
   - For source deployments running any MongoDB before {+c2c-version+}, where the deployments
     are managed or monitored by |onprem|, live migration (push) is deprecated.

     Use the following alternative ways to migrate your source deployments
     that are managed or monitored by |onprem| into |service|:

     - :cloudmgr:`Add your deployment to monitoring in Cloud Manager </tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes>`
       and use live migrate (push). See :ref:`<c2c-push-live-migration>`
       for MongoDB {+c2c-version+} or later, or the procedures in this section
       for MongoDB before {+c2c-version+}.
     - Use live migration (pull). See :ref:`c2c-pull-live-migration`
       for MongoDB {+c2c-version+} or later, and :ref:`live-migration-pre60`
       for MongoDB before {+c2c-version+}.
     - Use standalone |mongosync|.

If your source deployment runs MongoDB before {+c2c-version+} and is monitored by |com|,
you can use the procedures linked from this section to live migrate data
into |service| using the live migration service through the |service| UI.
