The |k8s-op-full| can use X.509 certificates to authenticate your
client applications to your MongoDB deployments.

This guide instructs you on how to configure:

- X.509 authentication from clients to your MongoDB instances.
- |tls| to encrypt connections between MongoDB hosts in a replica set
  or sharded cluster.
- |tls| to encrypt connections client applications and MongoDB
  deployments.
