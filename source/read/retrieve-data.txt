Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-long+} to retrieve
data from a MongoDB collection by using read operations. 

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:ref:`<java-rs-getting-started>`.

.. _java-rs-retrieve-find:

Find Documents
--------------

The {+driver-short+} includes one method for retrieving documents from a collection:
``find()``.

This method takes a **query filter** and returns one or more matching documents.
A query filter is an object that specifies the documents you want to retrieve in
your query. 

To learn more about query filters, see the :ref:`java-rs-specify-query` guide.

.. _java-rs-retrieve-find-one:

Find One Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find a single document in a collection, chain the ``first()`` method to your
``find()`` method call and pass a query filter to the ``find()`` method call
that specifies the criteria of the document you want to find. If more than one document matches the query
filter, the ``find().first()`` construct returns the *first* matching document from the retrieved
results. If no documents match the query filter, the construct returns ``None``.

.. tip::
   
   The ``find().first()`` construct is useful when you know there's only one matching document,
   or you're interested only in the first match.  

The following example uses the ``find().first()`` construct to find the first document where
the ``"cuisine"`` field has the value ``"Bakery"``:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   Publisher<Document> findDocPublisher = restaurants.find(
       eq("cuisine", "Bakery")).first();
   Mono.from(findDocPublisher)
           .doOnNext(System.out::println)
           .blockLast();
   
.. tip:: Sort Order

   If you do not specify a sort order, the ``find().first()`` construct returns the first document in 
   :manual:`natural order </reference/glossary/#std-term-natural-order>`
   on disk.

To learn more about sorting, see the :ref:`<java-rs-specify-documents-to-return>` guide.

.. _java-rs-retrieve-find-multiple:

Find Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find multiple documents in a collection, pass a query filter to the ``find()``
method that specifies the criteria of the documents you want to retrieve.

The following example uses the ``find()`` method to find all documents where
the ``"cuisine"`` field has the value ``"Spanish"``:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   FindPublisher<Document> findDocPublisher = restaurants.find(
           eq("cuisine", "Spanish"));
   Flux.from(findDocPublisher)
           .doOnNext(System.out::println)
           .blockLast();   

.. note:: Find All Documents

   To find all documents in a collection, pass no parameters to the ``find()`` method:

   .. code-block:: java

      Publisher<Document> findAllPublisher = restaurants.find();
      Flux.from(findAllPublisher)
              .doOnNext(System.out::println)
              .blockLast();
      

Modify Find Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``find()`` method by chaining other methods
to it. The following table describes commonly used methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Argument
     - Description

   * - ``batchSize(int batchSize)`` 
     - | The maximum number of documents within each batch returned in a query result. By default, the ``find`` 
         command has an initial batch size of ``101`` documents and a maximum size of 16 mebibytes (MiB)
         for each subsequent batch. This option can enforce a smaller limit than 16 MiB, but not a larger
         one. If you set ``batchSize`` to a limit that results in batches larger than
         16 MiB, this option has no effect. 
         
       | A ``batchSize`` of ``0`` means that the cursor will be established, but no documents 
         will be returned in the first batch.

   * - ``collation(Collation collation)`` 
     - | Sets the collation options as an instance of the ``Collation`` class. 

   * - ``comment(String comment)`` 
     - | Attaches a string to the query. This can help you trace and interpret the
         operation in the server logs and in profile data. To learn more about query comments, 
         see the :manual:`cursor.comment() </reference/method/cursor.comment/>` page in
         the {+mdb-server+} manual.
   
   * - ``hint(Bson hint)`` 
     - | Gets or sets the index to scan for documents. 
         For more information, see the :manual:`hint statement </reference/command/delete/#std-label-deletes-array-hint>`
         in the MongoDB Server manual.

The following example uses the ``find()`` method to find all documents where
the ``"cuisine"`` field has the value ``"Italian"`` and sets a comment:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   FindPublisher<Document> findDocPublisher = restaurants.find(
           eq("cuisine", "Italian")).comment("Find operation");
   Flux.from(findDocPublisher)
           .doOnNext(System.out::println)
           .blockLast();

For a full list of available arguments, see the
`API documentation <{+rs-driver-api+}/FindPublisher.html>`__
for the ``FindPublisher`` interface.
