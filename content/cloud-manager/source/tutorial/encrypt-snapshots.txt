|mms| can encrypt any backup job that it had stored in a snapshot
store. The snapshot must come from a database that ran
:product:`MongoDB Enterprise <mongodb-enterprise-advanced>` 4.2
or later with:

- |fcv-link| 4.2 or later and
- :ref:`WiredTiger <encrypted-storage-engine>` storage engine.

To encrypt backups, you use a master key that a |kmip|-compliant
key management appliance generates and maintains. This master key
encrypts key that encrypts the database.
