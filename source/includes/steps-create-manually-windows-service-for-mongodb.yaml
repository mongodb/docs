  If you have not created the data and log directories for your 
  MongoDB server, you must create them before running |mdb-edition| as 
  a Windows service.

title: Create a MongoDB configuration file.
stepnum: 2
ref: create-configuration-file
content: |
  Using your preferred text editor, create a MongoDB configuration
  file. The default location and filename are:

  .. code-block:: bat

     C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\mongod.cfg

  .. note::
     MongoDB configuration files use the
     `YAML <http://yaml.org>`__ file format. Per the `YAML 1.2
     specification <http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2777534>`__,
     all indents must use spaces to maintain portability. To ensure no
     parsing errors, enclose all values in double quotation marks
     (``"``) and escape any backslash characters (``\``).

  The file *must* set :setting:`systemLog.path`. Include additional
  :doc:`configuration options </reference/configuration-options>` as
  needed.

  .. example::

     Create a file at ``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\mongod.cfg``
     that specifies both :setting:`systemLog.path` and
     :setting:`storage.dbPath`:

     .. code-block:: yaml

        systemLog:
          destination: "file"
          path: "c:\\data\\log\\mongod.log"
        storage:
          dbPath: "c:\\data\\db"

title: Create the MongoDB service.
stepnum: 3
ref: create-mongodb-service
content: |

  Invoke the following command in the :guilabel:`Command Interpreter` 
  to create the service:  
  
  .. code-block:: bat

      sc.exe create MongoDB ^
        binPath= "\"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin\mongod.exe\" ^
        --service --config=\"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\mongod.cfg\"" ^
        DisplayName= "MongoDB" start= "auto"

  .. note::
      ``sc.exe`` requires a space between "``=`` " and the 
      configuration values (i.e. ``binPath= ``) as well as using
      `` "\"`` and ``\""`` to escape a double-quoted string.
  
  If successfully created, the following message is written to the 
  log:
  
  .. code-block:: bat

      [SC] CreateService SUCCESS

  Check your MongoDB log file for the following line:

  You may see non-critical warnings in the process
  output. As long as you see this message in the MongoDB log, you can 
  safely ignore these warnings during your initial evaluation of 
  MongoDB.

title: Connect to the MongoDB server.
stepnum: 6
ref: connect
content: |
  To connect to MongoDB through the 
  :binary:`mongo.exe <~bin.mongo>`
  shell, open another :guilabel:`Command Interpreter`.
  
  .. code-block:: bat

      "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin\mongo.exe"
