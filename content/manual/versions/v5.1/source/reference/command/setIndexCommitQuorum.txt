.. dbcommand:: setIndexCommitQuorum

   Changes the minimum number of data-bearing members (i.e commit
   quorum), including the primary, that must complete an in-progress
   :ref:`simultaneous index build <index-operations-simultaneous-build>`
   before the primary marks those indexes as ready.

   The command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand({ 
        setIndexCommitQuorum: <string>,
        indexNames: [ <document> ],
        commitQuorum: <int> | <string>,
        comment: <any>
      })

   The command takes the following parameters:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 60

      * - Field
        - Type
        - Description

      * - :ref:`setIndexCommitQuorum <setIndexCommitQuorum-cmd-coll>`

        - ``string``
        
        - .. _setIndexCommitQuorum-cmd-coll:
          
          The name of the collection for which the indexes are being 
          built.

      * - :ref:`indexNames <setIndexCommitQuorum-cmd-indexNames>`

        - ``array``

        - .. _setIndexCommitQuorum-cmd-indexNames:
        
          An array of in-progress index builds to modify. Each 
          element of the array must be the *name* of the index. 
         
          The indexes specified to ``indexNames`` must be the entire set
          of in-progress builds associated to a given index builder,
          i.e. the indexes built by a single :dbcommand:`createIndexes`
          or :method:`db.collection.createIndexes()` operation.

      * - :ref:`commitQuorum <setIndexCommitQuorum-cmd-commitQuorum>`

        - ``int`` or ``string``

        - .. _setIndexCommitQuorum-cmd-commitQuorum:
        
          The minimum number of data-bearing voting replica
          set members (i.e. commit quorum), including the primary, that
          must report a successful :ref:`index build
          <index-operations-replicated-build>` before the primary
          marks the ``indexes`` as ready. A "voting" member is any
          replica set member where :rsconf:`members[n].votes` is
          greater than ``0``.
          
          Starting in MongoDB v5.0 it is possible to resume some
          :ref:`interupted index builds<index-operations-build-failure>`
          when the commit quorum is set to ``"votingMembers"``. 
          
          The ``"votingMembers"`` commit quorum cannot be used if any 
          voting replica set node is configured with 
          :rsconf:`members[n].buildIndexes` set to ``false``. Either 
          configure all nodes with :rsconf:`members[n].buildIndexes` set 
          to ``true`` or select a commit quorum that requires fewer 
          votes. 

          Supports the following values:

          - ``"votingMembers"`` - all data-bearing voting replica set
            members. (*Default*)

          - ``"majority"`` - a simple majority of data-bearing voting
            replica set members.

          - ``<int>`` - a specific number of data-bearing voting 
            replica set members. Specify an integer greater than 
            ``0``.

          - A replica set :doc:`tag name
            </tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets>`.


      * - ``comment``

        - any

        - .. include:: /includes/extracts/comment-content.rst
       
          .. versionadded:: 4.4


Behavior
--------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-index-builds-simultaneous-fcv.rst

Issuing :dbcommand:`setIndexCommitQuorum` has no effect on index builds
started with :ref:`commitQuorum <createIndexes-cmd-commitQuorum>` of
``0``. 

Examples
--------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-index-builds-simultaneous.rst

The following operation starts an index build of two indexes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("examples").invoices.createIndexes(
     [
       { "invoices" : 1 },
       { "fulfillmentStatus" : 1 }
     ]
   )

By default, index builds use ``"votingMembers"`` commit quorum, or all
data-bearing voting replica set members. The following operation
modifies the index build commit quorum to ``"majority"``, or a 
simple majority of data-bearing voting members:. 

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("examples").runCommand(
     {
       "setIndexCommitQuorum" : "invoices", 
       "indexNames" : ["invoices_1", "fullfillmentStatus_1"], 
       "commitQuorum" : "majority"
     }
   )

- The indexes specified to ``indexNames`` must be the entire set
  of in-progress builds associated to a given index builder, 
  i.e. the :method:`~db.collection.createIndexes()` operation. 

- The ``indexNames`` field specifies the *names* of the indexes. Since
  the indexes were created without an explicit name, MongoDB generated
  an index name by concatenating the names of the indexed fields and the
  sort order.
