title: Disable the balancer process.
stepnum: 1
ref: disable-balancer
pre: |
   Disable the :term:`balancer` process that equalizes the distribution of
   data among the :term:`shards <shard>`. To disable the balancer, use the
   :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` method in the :program:`mongo` shell. For
   example:
action:
   language: javascript
   code: |
      use config
      sh.setBalancerState(false)
post: |
   For more information, see the
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily` procedure.

   .. warning::

      If you do not stop the balancer, the backup could have duplicate
      data or omit data as :term:`chunks <chunk>` migrate while recording
      backups.

title: Lock replica set members.
stepnum: 2
ref: lock-replica-set-members
pre: |
   Lock one member of each replica set in each shard so that your backups
   reflect the state of your database at the nearest possible
   approximation of a single moment in time. Lock these :program:`mongod`
   instances in as short of an interval as possible.

   To lock or freeze a sharded cluster, you shut down one member of each
   replica set. Ensure that the :term:`oplog` has sufficient capacity to
   allow these secondaries to catch up to the state of the primaries after
   finishing the backup procedure. See :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing` for
   more information.
---
title: Backup one config server.
stepnum: 3
ref: backup-config-server
pre: |
   Use :program:`mongodump` to backup one of the :ref:`config servers
   <sharding-config-server>`. This backs up the cluster's metadata. You
   only need to back up one config server, as they all hold the same data.

   Use the :program:`mongodump` tool to capture the content of the config
   :program:`mongod` instances.

   Your config servers must run MongoDB 2.4 or later with the
   :option:`--configsvr <mongod --configsvr>` option and the
   :program:`mongodump` option must include the :option:`--oplog
   <mongodump --oplog>` to capture a consistent copy of the config
   database:
action:
   language: sh
   code: |
      mongodump --oplog --db config
---
title: Backup replica set members.
stepnum: 4
ref: backup-replica-set-members
pre: |
   Back up the replica set members of the shards that shut down using
   :program:`mongodump` and specifying the
   :option:`--dbpath <mongodump --dbpath>` option. You may back up the
   shards in parallel. Consider the following invocation:
action:
   language: sh
   code: |
      mongodump --journal --dbpath /data/db/ --out /data/backup/
post: |
   You must run :program:`mongodump` on the same system where the
   :program:`mongod` ran. This operation will create a dump of all the
   data managed by the :program:`mongod` instances that used the
   :setting:`~storage.dbPath` ``/data/db/``.  :program:`mongodump`
   writes the output of this dump to the ``/data/backup/``
   directory.
---
title: Restart replica set members.
stepnum: 5
ref: restart-replica-set-members
pre: |
   Restart all stopped replica set members of each shard as normal and
   allow them to catch up with the state of the primary.
---
title: Re-enable the balancer process.
stepnum: 6
ref: reenable-balancer-process
pre: |
   Re-enable the balancer with the :method:`sh.setBalancerState()`
   method.

   Use the following command sequence when connected to the
   :program:`mongos` with the :program:`mongo` shell:
action:
   language: sh
   code: |
      use config
      sh.setBalancerState(true)
...
