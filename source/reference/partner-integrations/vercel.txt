You can connect your |service| {+clusters+} to applications that you
deploy using |vercel|.

Use this page to complete the following tasks:

- Connect Vercel users and teams to organizations in |service|.
- Create links from Vercel projects for these users and teams to
  |service| {+clusters+}.

|vercel| integrates with the Next.js network. To learn more about 
using Next.js with MongoDB, including deploying in |vercel| without 
this official integration, you can also see 
`Integrate MongoDB Into Your Next.js App <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/nextjs-with-mongodb/>`__.

- :ref:`Accounts in Vercel (Personal or Team) <vercel-personal-team-accounts>`
- :ref:`Vercel Projects <vercel-projects>`
- :ref:`IP Access Lists in Atlas and IP Allow Lists in Vercel <vercel-access-lists>`


.. _vercel-personal-team-accounts:

Accounts in Vercel (Personal or Team)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The integration with |vercel| requires that you:

- `Create a new personal account <https://vercel.com/new>`__ or
  `create a new team <https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/teams/overview>`__
  in Vercel.
- Use an existing personal or team account in Vercel.

.. note::

   You can add a Vercel integration as a personal account user and then
   add another Vercel integration as a team user.

   You can't change the scope of an existing integration from a personal
   account to a team level account in Vercel. 
   
   If you use a personal Vercel account for your MongoDB integration,
   and want to switch to an integration for a team to the same |service|
   organization, you must :ref:`disconnect an existing integration
   <disconnect-vercel>` in |service|, and
   :ref:`add a new integration with a team scope
   <vercel-add-integration>`.

.. _vercel-projects:

Projects in Vercel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can link one |service| {+cluster+} to more than one project in |vercel|.

To configure the integration, you must have one or more projects in your
personal or team |vercel| account.

The list of Vercel projects that you can choose for the integration
depends on the user or team scope.

.. _vercel-access-lists:

IP Access Lists in |service| and IP Allow Lists in Vercel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|vercel| deployments use |vercel-dynamic|.

To connect to |a-service| {+cluster+}, the :doc:`IP access list
</security/ip-access-list/>` of your |service| {+cluster+} must allow all
IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0).
If |service| doesn't find an entry for 0.0.0.0/0 in your |service|
project's IP access list, |service| adds it on your behalf, as part of
the integration workflow.

When you set up the integration, |service| performs these actions to
secure your Vercel connections to the {+cluster+}:

- Creates a ``MONGODB_URI`` environment variable that serves as the |service|
  {+cluster+}\'s connection string for all Vercel projects that you link
  this {+cluster+} to.

  When your application doesn't specify a database, the ``MONGODB_URI``
  variable uses ``/myFirstDatabase`` as the default database name.
  Replace this name with your database name, or if you use a library to
  interface with MongoDB, ensure that your application's code specifies
  your database name.

- Creates a database user, ``vercel-admin-user``, in the admin database
  and grants the built-in :manual:`readWriteAnyDatabase
  </reference/built-in-roles/#mongodb-authrole-readWriteAnyDatabase>`
  MongoDB database role to all other non system databases in the {+cluster+}.

.. _vercel-add-integration:

Add a Vercel Integration
-------------------------

This procedure allows you to create a new account in |service| with its
organization, project, and user role, and then create a new {+cluster+},
or use an existing |service| account, organization, project, and |service|
{+cluster+} for integration with |vercel|.

To integrate Vercel applications with |service| {+clusters+}, you begin 
in the |vercel| UI.

.. procedure::
   style: connected

   .. step:: Navigate to the MongoDB |service| integration.

      Go to |vercel-mdb| and click :guilabel:`Add integration`.

   .. step:: Choose the scope of your integration (user or team).

      a. Choose one of the Vercel scopes from the drop-down menu:

         - :guilabel:`Personal Account`
         - :guilabel:`Team`

         After you set the scope for your integration, you can't change
         it. To switch to a scope that differs from your chosen scope,
         :ref:`disconnect <disconnect-vercel>` one integration and create
         another one using this procedure.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Continue`.

   .. step:: Select Vercel projects to link to |a-service| {+cluster+}.

      You can choose specific projects or all projects. You can later edit
      the integration to change the projects. The project list depends on
      the user or team scope that you specified in the previous step.

      Select one of the following options:

      - :guilabel:`All Projects`
      - :guilabel:`Specific Projects`

   #. Click :guilabel:`Add Integration`.

   .. step:: Create your MongoDB Account, if you don't already have one.

      a. Choose one of the following options:

         - If you're using your :ref:`Google Accounts <google-accounts>`,
           follow the steps for signing into it, or create a new Google account.
         - If you're using your email, it's already filled in and grayed out.
         - If your company uses :doc:`federated authentication
           </security/federated-authentication>`, use your company's
           email address. Proceed with the verification steps required
           for your federated user access.
         - If you already have |a-service| account, click :guilabel:`Log in now`.
           See :ref:`Log in to Your Atlas Account <atlas-account-login>`.

      #. Enter your first and last names, and choose a password. A password
         must contain at least 8 characters, contain unique characters,
         numbers, or symbols, and not contain your email address.
         See :ref:`Register a new Atlas Account <atlas-register-account>`.

      #. Click the checkbox :guilabel:`I accept the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service`.

         Review the :website:`Terms of Service </cloud-terms-and-conditions>`
         and the :legal:`Privacy Policy </privacy-policy>`.

   .. step:: Select |a-service| organization to integrate with Vercel.

      a. Select |a-service| organization from the drop-down, or
         :ref:`create a new Atlas organization <create-organization>`.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Continue`.

      #. Confirm access to your |service| organization.

         |service| creates an organization for you. Click
         :guilabel:`I Acknowledge` to confirm that you grant Vercel
         access to your |service| organization.

         To remove access from this Vercel integration to your MongoDB
         |service| organization, you must :ref:`disconnect <disconnect-vercel>`
         this integration.
      
      #. Select |a-service| project to integrate with Vercel from the
         drop-down, or :ref:`create a new project <create-project>`.

   .. step:: Create a new free tier {+cluster+}, or link an existing {+cluster+} to one or more Vercel projects.
      
      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Link an existing {+cluster+}
            :tabid: link-existing

            If you already have |a-service| account, you can choose an existing
            organization and project, and then choose an existing {+cluster+}.

            Ensure that you have the |service| :authrole:`Project Owner`
            role.

            a. Choose |a-service| {+cluster+} from the drop-down on the
               left side of the mapping.

            #. Choose one or more Vercel projects from the drop-down on
               the right side. You can map one |service| {+cluster+} to
               one or more Vercel projects.
               The drop-down menu shows one project, or all projects,
               depending on what you chose for this integration earlier
               in this procedure. You can later
               :ref:`link more Vercel projects <edit-remove-links-vercel>`
               to the same |service| {+cluster+} in this integration.

            If the selected project doesn't have the 0.0.0.0./0 entry in
            the |service| access list, |service| asks you to acknowledge
            that you are creating |a-service| {+cluster+} with full access
            due to |vercel-dynamic| in |vercel|. |service| sends you an
            email with this information.

         .. tab:: Create a new free tier {+cluster+}
            :tabid: create-new

            a. :doc:`Create a new cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster>`
               if you don't have |a-service| {+cluster+}. You can later
               :ref:`modify the cluster that you created <scale-cluster>`.

               Ensure that you have the |service| :authrole:`Project Owner`
               role.

               |service| creates a new free tier {+cluster+}, and links it
               to the Vercel projects you selected. You can later
               :ref:`link more Vercel projects <edit-remove-links-vercel>`
               to the same |service| {+cluster+}.

            #. Click :icon-fa5:`check` to acknowledge these statements:
         
               - The IP Access list contains 0.0.0.0/0, which opens inbound
                 access to |service| {+clusters+} within selected |service|
                 projects to all IP addresses.

               - Your |vercel| deployment requires this access because it
                 uses |vercel-dynamic| to connect to |service|.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Return to Vercel` and review the integration's details.

      |service| sends you a confirmation email with the details of your
      integration. The integration window closes and you return to the
      Vercel UI where you can update the Vercel projects in this
      integration.

Manage a Vercel Integration in the {+atlas-ui+}
-----------------------------------------------

To manage the integration with |vercel|, use the :guilabel:`Integrations`
page for your :ref:`organization <organization-settings>` in |service|.

.. procedure::
   style: connected

   .. step:: Select your organization from the :icon-mms:`office` :guilabel:`Organizations` menu in the navigation bar.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Integrations` in the sidebar and then select :guilabel:`Vercel`.

      From here, you can perform these tasks:

      - :ref:`Link additional Atlas {+clusters+} with projects in Vercel
        <add-links-vercel>`
      - :ref:`Edit or remove the linking from your Atlas {+cluster+} to
        one or all projects in Vercel <edit-remove-links-vercel>`
      - :ref:`Disconnect your Vercel integration <disconnect-vercel>`

.. _add-links-vercel:

Link Additional |service| {+Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To link additional {+clusters+} in your organization to projects in |vercel|,
use the :guilabel:`Link clusters` button on the |service| :guilabel:`Integrations`
page for Vercel.

.. note:: Use this procedure for an already configured integration. To
   configure an initial integration, see :ref:`vercel-add-integration`.

.. procedure::
   style:: connected

   .. step:: Go to your organization.
   
      Select your organization from the :icon-mms:`office`
      :guilabel:`Organizations` menu in the navigation bar.

   .. step:: Go to your Vercel integration.
   
      a. Click :guilabel:`Integrations` in the sidebar.
      
      #. Select :guilabel:`Vercel`.

   .. step:: Link another |service| {+cluster+} to one or more Vercel projects.
   
      Click :guilabel:`Link Clusters`.
      
      The :guilabel:`Add Another Cluster Link with Vercel` window opens
      and shows your |service| organization.

      #. Select |a-service| project.
      
      #. In the left drop-down list, select a {+cluster+} not linked to Vercel.
         If your project doesn't have another |service| {+cluster+}, you
         can :doc:`create one </tutorial/create-new-cluster>`.

      #. In the right drop-down list, select one or more Vercel projects.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

      You receive a confirmation email from |service| with the details
      of your integration.

      A new linked |service| {+cluster+} appears in the linked {+clusters+} list.

To link a {+cluster+} from another |service| project in your organization
to Vercel, repeat this procedure for that project.

.. _edit-remove-links-vercel:

Edit or Remove Links to |service| {+Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add or remove Vercel projects that you linked to |a-service| {+cluster+}.

.. procedure::
   style:: connected

   .. step:: Go to your Vercel integration.
   
      Click :guilabel:`Integrations` in the sidebar.
      
      #. Select :guilabel:`Vercel`.

   .. step:: To add or remove some Vercel projects, click :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` :guilabel:`Edit` next to the linked |service| project.

      |service| displays existing linked Vercel projects.

      To edit existing links, in the right-side list, choose a project
      from the drop-down. You can:

      - Click :icon-fa5:`check` next to a Vercel project in the list
        to add it to this {+cluster+}'s integration.

      - Click :icon-fa5:`times-circle` to remove some Vercel projects
        from this integration.

   .. step:: To remove links to all Vercel projects, click :icon-fa5:`unlink` :guilabel:`Unlink` next to the linked |service| project.

      |service| asks you to confirm that you want to unlink the {+cluster+}
      from the projects. To confirm, click  :guilabel:`Unlink`.
      |service| removes the environment variables for Vercel projects
      that it created when you linked the projects to |a-service| {+cluster+}.

      If you unlink all projects, |service| behaves as follows. It:
      
      - Doesn't remove your data, database users,
        or IP access lists that you created for this integration.

      - Doesn't delete the {+cluster+}, or the integration, even though
        the {+atlas-ui+} might show that you have no linked {+clusters+}
        in your integration. To disable the integration,
        you must :ref:`disconnect Vercel <disconnect-vercel>`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. _disconnect-vercel:

Disconnect a Vercel Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you disconnect |vercel| projects from |service| {+clusters+},
to avoid downtime to any applications connected to the same |service|
{+clusters+}, verify that the {+cluster+}\'s users and network access
rules don't share other projects and applications connected to this
|service| {+cluster+}.

.. procedure::
   style:: connected

   .. step:: Go to your Vercel integration in the {+atlas-ui+}.

      a. Click :guilabel:`Integrations` in the sidebar.

      #. Select :guilabel:`Vercel`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Disconnect Vercel`.

      In this step, click :icon-fa5:`check` to request |service| to do
      these optional tasks for you:
      
      - :guilabel:`Delete the database users created as part of this
        integration`
      - :guilabel:`Delete the network access rules created as part of this
        integration`

   .. step:: Confirm that you want to disconnect this Vercel integration.

      |service| asks you to confirm that you want to disconnect your
      |service| organization from Vercel.

      Disconnecting the integration may result in downtime for your Vercel
      applications and any other applications connecting to the |service|
      {+clusters+} that you linked to Vercel.
      
      To confirm, enter the words ``Disconnect Vercel`` in capital
      letters and then click :guilabel:`Disconnect Vercel`.

      |service| removes the integration by removing the environment
      variables for Vercel projects that it created when you linked the
      projects to |a-service| {+cluster+}.

      Vercel also removes the integration and it no longer displays in
      the Vercel UI.

   After you disconnect the Vercel integration, if you haven't deleted the
   MongoDB database users and IP access rules, you can
   :ref:`delete database users <delete-mongodb-users>` and
   :ref:`delete IP access lists <delete-ip-access-list-entry-ui>`
   now.

   .. note::
      When you remove an integration in the Vercel UI, |service| also
      removes the integration and you don't need to
      :ref:`disconnect the integration <disconnect-vercel>` in the
      {+atlas-ui+}.
