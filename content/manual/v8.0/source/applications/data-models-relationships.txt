MongoDB's flexible data model gives you multiple options to map
relationships between different entities in your schema.

Generally, your choice of data model depends on whether you want to
:ref:`embed related data <data-modeling-embedding>` in the same
collection or use :ref:`references <data-modeling-referencing>` to
connect related data that exists in separate collections. Before you
choose a relationship pattern, review :ref:`embedding-vs-references` to
understand the advantages of each approach.

These pages show examples of different data relationships and how to
apply them in a MongoDB schema:

- :ref:`data-modeling-example-one-to-one`

- :ref:`data-modeling-example-one-to-many`

- :ref:`data-modeling-publisher-and-books`

- :ref:`data-modeling-example-many-to-many`
