.. note:: Release notes mention only releases with feature changes

   MongoDB releases {+adl+} every two weeks, continuously improving
   {+adl+} performance and stability. These release notes capture only
   those releases that contain feature changes. If a particular {+adl+}
   release contains only performance and stability improvements, it is not
   included in these release notes. To identify which release version you
   are using, check the release version string for the release date.

.. This is a comment.
   The following include file is empty as of Jan 24th, 2023. This is
   because the two releases that took place in 2023 had no feature changes,
   they only had performance and stability improvements.
   Please update the following include file only for releases that have
   feature changes. Also, once you add the first entry to the include file,
   add the title to this section, 2023 Releases.
