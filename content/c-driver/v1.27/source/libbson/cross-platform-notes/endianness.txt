.. _bson_endianness:

==========
Endianness
==========

The BSON specification dictates that the encoding format is in little-endian. Many implementations simply ignore
endianness altogether and expect that they are to be run on little-endian. Libbson supports both Big and Little
Endian systems. This means we use ``memcpy()`` when appropriate instead of dereferencing and properly convert to
and from the host endian format. We expect the compiler intrinsics to optimize it to a dereference when possible.
