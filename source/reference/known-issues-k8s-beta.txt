Known Issues in the |k8s-op-full| Beta

Disable Backups before Deleting a Resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When deleting a resource that has backup configured, you must disable backup first.

Configure Persistent Storage Correctly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there are no
`persistent volumes <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/>`__
available when you create a resource, the resulting |k8s-pod| stays in
transient state and the Operator fails  (after 20 retries) with the
following error:

.. code-block:: sh

   Failed to update Ops Manager automation config: Some agents failed to register

To prevent this error, either:

- Provide `persistent volumes <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/>`__ or
- Set ``persistent : false`` for the resource

For testing only, you may also set ``persistent : false``. This
*must not be used in production*, as data is not preserved between
restarts.

Remove Resources before Removing |k8s|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes |onprem| can diverge from |k8s|. This mostly occurs when
|k8s| resources are removed manually. |onprem| can keep displaying an
Automation Agent which has been shut down.

If you want to remove deployments of MongoDB on |k8s|, use the
resource specification to delete resources first so no dead Automation
Agents remain.

Create Separate Namespaces for |k8s-op-short| and MongoDB Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best strategy is to create |k8s-op-short| and its resources in
different namespaces so that the following operations would work
correctly:

.. code-block:: sh

   kubectl delete pods --all

or

.. code-block:: sh

   kubectl delete namespace mongodb

If the |k8s-op-short| and resources sit in the same ``mongodb``
|k8s-ns|, then operator would also be removed in the same operation.
This would mean that it could not clean the configurations, which
would have to be done in the |application|.

Difficulties with Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, the |k8s-op-short| can stop receiving change events. As
this problem is hard to reproduce, the recommended workaround is to
delete the operator pod. |k8s| starts the new |k8s-op-short|
automatically and starts working correctly:

.. code-block:: sh

   kubectl get pods;
   kubectl delete pod mongodb-enterprise-operator-<podId>`

.. cond:: onprem
