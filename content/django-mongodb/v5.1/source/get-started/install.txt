in your development environment.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Install the dependencies

      Before installing {+django-odm+}, ensure you have `Python 3.10 or later <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
      installed in your development environment.

   .. step:: Create a virtual environment

      Select the tab corresponding to your operating system and run the following commands
      to create and activate a virtual environment in which to install {+django-odm+}:

      .. tabs::

          .. tab:: macOS / Linux
             :tabid: mac-linux-venv

             .. code-block:: bash

                python -m venv venv
                source venv/bin/activate

          .. tab:: Windows
             :tabid: windows-venv

             .. code-block:: bash

                python -m venv venv
                . venv\Scripts\activate

      .. tip::

         In the preceding commands, you might need to replace
         ``python`` with the command that points to your Python
         3.10+ interpreter.

   .. step:: Install {+django-odm+}

      With the virtual environment activated, run the following command to install
      the Django integration:

      .. code-block:: bash

         pip install django-mongodb-backend

      This command also installs the following dependencies:

      - PyMongo version {+pymongo-version+} and its dependencies
      - Latest {+framework+} {+django-version+}.x version and its dependencies

After you complete these steps, you have {+django-odm+} and its
dependencies installed in your development environment.
