Overview
--------

.. short-description::
   
   Create and insert documents into MongoDB.

In this guide, you will insert data into MongoDB.

.. time:: 15

What You'll Need
----------------

.. include:: /includes/prereqs_read_CRUD.rst

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-selector:: drivers

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Connect to your MongoDB instance.

      .. include:: /includes/drivers_insert_connect.rst

   .. step:: Get the database and collection.

      Switch to the database and collection you want to work with. In
      this case you will be using the ``{+guides-db+}`` database and
      ``comets`` collection. 

      .. include:: /includes/bind_db_insert.rst

   .. step:: Insert documents into the ``comets`` collection.

      Create and insert three new documents for the ``comets``
      collection. Each document consists of the following
      information about the comet:

      - The name
      - The official name
      - The orbital period in years
      - The radius in miles
      - The mass in kilograms

      .. include:: /includes/insert_documents.rst

      .. tip:: 
         
         If you omit the ``_id`` field, the driver 
         automatically generates a unique ``ObjectId`` value for the 
         ``_id`` field.

   .. step:: Display your results.

      Many write operations in MongoDB return a result object that
      contains information about the operation. 
      
      .. include:: /includes/insert_display.rst

   .. step:: Check your results.

      Here is the complete code followed by sample output.

      .. note:: 

         Your ``ObjectId`` values will differ from those shown.
