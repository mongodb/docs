Solution Overview
-----------------

Airport ground operations support over 40 million flights annually and
involve numerous tasks like baggage handling, refueling, catering, and
maintenance. This complexity is compounded by less-experienced staff,
which increases the likelihood of human error, threatens safety, and
leads to costly flight delays. For instance, a 15-minute delay for an
Airbus A321 can `cost airlines around €3,030
<https://ansperformance.eu/economics/cba/standard-inputs/latest/chapters/cost_of_delay>`__
(approximately $3500).

This solution uses Dataworkz, Google Cloud and MongoDB Atlas to power an
agentic voice assistant for airport ground operations. This assistant
guides operators through essential checklists, retrieves real-time
answers from embedded manuals via Dataworkz’s :abbr:`RAG
(Retrieval-Augmented Generation)` application, and logs actions for
audit and optimization. The system enables hands-free interaction by
using Vertex AI for speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and :abbr:`NLP
(Natural Language Processing)`, and uses Atlas Vector Search for
context-aware retrieval. Staff can use the voice assistant as an
intelligent knowledge base, which ensures compliance, increases
operational efficiency, and reduces the training time for ground crews.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

This solution has the following architecture:

   :alt: Intelligent airport ground operations architecture
   
   Figure 1. Intelligent airport ground operations architecture

As shown in Figure 1, this solution uses the following technologies:

- **Dataworkz for RAG and agentic AI:** Dataworkz is a managed RAG
  platform that provides an agentic AI framework and an AI-optimized
  data layer. It facilitates seamless data integration into MongoDB
  Atlas and manages the end-to-end RAG workflow by ingesting and
  embedding technical manuals and regulations with Voyage AI models.
  Dataworkz's RAG builder integrates the voice assistant with complex
  information from safety manuals that it stores in MongoDB. After the
  end-to-end workflow completes, Dataworkz then executes queries with
  MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for accurate information retrieval.

- **MongoDB Atlas as the core database:** MongoDB Atlas serves as
  the application's centralized data store. Its flexibility and
  scalability allows it to store large volumes of unstructured data that
  are common in AI workloads. Additionally, its aggregation framework
  simplifies data processing for AI application development. Atlas also
  stores session activity logs and raw and vectorized text data from
  embedded manuals, which Dataworkz queries using Vector Search.

- **Google Cloud for speech and NLP:** Vertex AI from Google Cloud
  provides essential speech-to-text, text-to-speech and NLP
  capabilities, enabling natural interactions with the agentic voice
  assistant for ground crew. For example, if an operator asks an
  aircraft question, such as *What do you mean by nose gear torsion?*
  Vertex AI performs speech-to-text conversion and sends the information
  to Dataworkz, which intelligently queries MongoDB using Vector Search.

- **Voice assistant functionality:** The agentic voice assistant
  dynamically feeds checklist items to operators. The system provides
  instant validation, reads next steps, and offers additional context
  from manuals if it detects discrepancies. Dataworkz enables
  intelligent querying of embedded manuals via MongoDB Atlas Vector
  Search, delivering context-specific answers in real-time.

Data Model Approach
-------------------

MongoDB's flexible document model supports the unstructured data used in
AI development, such as data from complex monitoring and logging systems
in the airport environment. MongoDB Atlas stores agent memory, including
the current state of checklists, individual steps, and RAG-generated
logs. These logs help track queries for training, and audit trails for
security compliance. 

The code snippet below shows how the ``logs`` collection records NLP
queries.

.. code-block:: json  
   :copyable: true  

   {
      "_id": {
         "$oid": "686ffc11d66babf8cd958229"
      },
      "sessionId": "efc07eac-ef36-4487-adc0-5c0f82eddfe7",
      "logs": [
         {
            "timestamp": "2025-07-10T17:44:48.838Z",
            "toolName": "consultManual",
            "type": "call",
            "details": {
               "name": "consultManual",
               "args": {
                  "query": "What is a tow bar operation?"
               }
            }
         }
      ]
   }

The solution logs and stores each ground operation as a JSON document in
MongoDB Atlas for audit and optimization. Each document has a unique
``sessionId``, which you can use to update the documents as necessary.

Build the Solution
------------------

You can replicate this solution by following the ``README`` in the
`GitHub repository
<https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/aircraft-groundops-sync>`__,
which guides you through the following steps.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Set up the prerequisites

      Install the following dependencies:

      - Node.js 20+

      - Next.js

      - MongoDB Atlas cluster with an ``admin`` role for your database

      - GCP account with Vertex AI enabled and API access

      - Dataworkz account with API key access to your LLM

   .. step:: Clone the GitHub repository

      Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine with the
      following command: 

      .. code-block:: sh  
         :copyable: true  

         git clone https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/aircraft-groundops-sync.git

   .. step:: Install required dependencies

      Navigate to the cloned directory and run the following command to
      install dependencies:

      .. code-block:: sh  
         :copyable: true  

         npm install

   .. step:: Configure your Dataworkz setup

      Create a ``.env.local`` file in the root directory of the solution
      and add your environment variables. These include your MongoDB
      connection string, Dataworkz API keys, and Google Cloud Project
      details. 
      
   .. step:: Install required dependencies

      Log into your Dataworkz account to set up the RAG application, as
      follows:

      a. Create a new RAG application.
      
      #. Configure the knowledge base by ingesting aircraft operations
         documents, technical manuals, and regulations.
        
      #. For your environment variables file, configure and obtain your
         ``DATAWORKZ_SYSTEM_ID`` and ``DATAWORKZ_LLM_PROVIDER_ID``
        
      #. You can use `Voyage AI
         <https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings>`__ text embedding
         models for your RAG application.

   .. step:: Run the application

      Execute the application in development mode by running this command:

      .. code-block:: sh  
         :copyable: true

      Then, open ``http://localhost:3000`` in your browser to access the
      aircraft ground operations dashboard.
      
      Alternatively, run the application in production mode with the
      following command:   

      .. code-block:: sh  
         :copyable: true  

         npm run build

Key Learnings
-------------

- **Reduction in training time and cognitive load:** With this solution,
  ground crews do not need to memorize every detail of extensive
  manuals. The voice assistant acts as an intelligent knowledge base
  that delivers context-aware answers in real-time, and reduces the
  cognitive burden of keeping track of the operation steps and aircraft
  manuals. 

- **Enhanced error prevention and compliance:** The compliance checklist
  provides immediate access to correct procedures, minimizes the risks
  of human error due to forgotten steps, and enhances safety and
  compliance through session activity logs. 

- **Data-driven optimization:** Analyze and audit your data by using
  session activity logs stored in MongoDB Atlas. These logs enable
  continuous optimization by providing data-driven insights which
  identify areas that need additional training or improvements in manual
  content.

- **Flexible and scalable AI-powered guidance:** MongoDB’s flexible
  document model, real-time processing capabilities, and advanced vector
  search can be integrated to build an agentic voice assistance system.
  This architecture helps AI applications handle complex operational
  environments by seamlessly integrating structured and unstructured
  data.
