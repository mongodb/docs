.. important:: You Can't Disable a {+bcp+}

   After you enable a {+bcp+}, only MongoDB support can disable it with 
   a request from the security or legal representative specified for 
   the {+bcp+}. Only the security or legal representative specified for 
   the {+bcp+} can make this request.
   
   To disable a {+bcp+}, the security or legal representative 
   specified for the {+bcp+} must :ref:`request support 
   <request-support>` and complete an extensive verification process.

   Before you enable a {+bcp+}, carefully review the 
   :ref:`prohibited actions <bcp-prohibited-actions>` and 
   :ref:`considerations <bcp-considerations>`. You can re-enable a 
   {+bcp+} at any time.
