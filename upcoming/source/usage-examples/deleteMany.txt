You can delete multiple documents in a collection by calling the
``delete()`` method on an object collection or a query builder.

To delete multiple documents, pass a query filter to the ``where()``
method. Then, delete the matching documents by calling the ``delete()``
method.

.. tip::

   To learn more about deleting documents with the {+odm-short+}, see
   the :ref:`laravel-fundamentals-delete-documents` section of the Write
   Operations guide.

Example
-------

Select from the following :guilabel:`Eloquent` and :guilabel:`Query
Builder` tabs to view usage examples for the same operation that use
each corresponding query syntax:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Eloquent
      :tabid: eloquent-model-count

      This example performs the following actions:
      
      - Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies``
        collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database 
      - Deletes documents from the ``movies`` collection that match a
        query filter
      - Prints the number of deleted documents
      
      The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:
      
      - ``where()``: Matches documents in which the value of the
        ``year`` field is less than or equal to ``1910``
      - ``delete()``: Deletes the matched documents and returns the
        number of documents successfully deleted
      
      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true
      
         .. input:: ../includes/usage-examples/DeleteManyTest.php
            :start-after: begin-eloquent-delete-many
            :end-before: end-eloquent-delete-many
            :language: php
            :dedent:
      
         .. output::
            :language: console
            :visible: false
      
            Deleted documents: 7

   .. tab:: Query Builder
      :tabid: query-builder-count

      This example performs the following actions:
      
      - Accesses the ``movies`` collection by calling the ``table()``
        method from the ``DB`` facade
      - Deletes documents from the ``movies`` collection that match a
        query filter
      - Prints the number of deleted documents
      
      The example calls the following query builder methods:
      
      - ``where()``: Matches documents in which the value of the
        ``year`` field is less than or equal to ``1910``
      - ``delete()``: Deletes the matched documents and returns the
        number of documents successfully deleted
      
      .. io-code-block::
      
         .. input:: ../includes/usage-examples/DeleteManyTest.php
            :start-after: begin-qb-delete-many
            :end-before: end-qb-delete-many
            :language: php
            :dedent:
      
         .. output::
            :language: console
            :visible: false
      
            Deleted documents: 7
