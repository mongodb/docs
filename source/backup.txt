|backup| is a system that creates backups of
MongoDB replica sets and sharded clusters. A lightweight agent runs
within your infrastructure and captures data from your MongoDB
deployment using the same mechanism as replication.
|backup| hosts the backup data and snapshots using its own
infrastructure.

This manual describes the process for registering and activating
|backup|, the process for installing the Backup Agent, and the basic
procedures for enabling backups and restoring from a backup.
