Atlas Device SDK for Flutter version 2.0.0 introduces several breaking changes
that impact existing apps upgrading from an earlier version.

Notably, this version of the SDK:

- Changes the part builder and how the SDK generates files for
  your data model classes. This change impacts all apps upgrading from an
  earlier version of the SDK. Refer to the :ref:`flutter-v2-builder-breaking-changes`
  section on this page for information and instructions.

- Removes or replaces several classes and members. These changes may or may not impact your
  app. Refer to the :ref:`flutter-v2-removed-classes` section
  on this page for information and instructions for impacted apps.

Builder Changes
---------------

.. important::

   This change impacts all apps upgrading from an earlier version of the SDK.

Flutter SDK version 2.0.0 updates the SDK's ``realm_generator`` to use a
``PartBuilder`` instead of a ``SharedPartBuilder``.
This updated builder generates ``RealmModel`` data model files with a new
``.realm.dart`` file extension:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50

   * - Version
     - File Extension
     - Example Part Directive

   * - SDK v2.0.0 and later
     - ``.realm.dart``
     - .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/migrate_parts.snippet.part-directive-new.dart
        :language: dart

   * - SDK v1.9.0 and earlier
     - ``.g.dart``
     - .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/migrate_parts.snippet.part-directive-old.dart
        :language: dart

.. tip::

    The update from ``SharedPartBuilder`` to ``PartBuilder`` makes it easier
    to use multiple builders in your app. For example, combining ``realm_dart``
    with a serialization package builder such as ``dart_mappable`` or
    ``json_serializable``.

What Do I Need to Do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you upgrade an existing app from an earlier version of the Flutter SDK to
version 2.0.0 or later, you *must* update any existing part declarations, then
regenerate the object models with the new ``.realm.dart`` file extension:

.. procedure::

    .. step:: Update Your Existing Part Declarations

       Update all of the ``RealmObject`` part declarations in your app to
       use the new naming convention:

       .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/migrate_parts.snippet.migrate-model-dart-new.dart
           :language: dart
           :emphasize-lines: 3-5

    .. step:: Regenerate Your Object Models

       .. tabs::

          .. tab:: Flutter
              :tabid: flutter

              After you update all of your declarations, regenerate your
              object models with the new ``.realm.dart`` file extension.
              You can safely delete any ``.g.dart`` files from your project.

              .. code-block::

                dart run realm generate

          .. tab:: Dart Standalone
              :tabid: dart

              After you update all of your declarations, regenerate your
              object models with the new ``.realm.dart`` file extension.
              You can safely delete any ``.g.dart`` files from your project.

              .. code-block::

                dart run realm_dart generate

.. _flutter-v2-removed-classes:

Removed Classes and Members
---------------------------

Flutter SDK version 2.0.0 also removed or replaced several classes, members, and properties
from the SDK. These changes may or may not impact your app.

The following table outlines what was removed and why, as well as a recommended solution
when upgrading an app that used the removed class or member, if any:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 33 33 33

   * - Removed Class or Member
     - Reason
     - Solution

   * - ``AppConfiguration.localAppName`` and ``AppConfiguration.localAppVersion``
     - Unused in SDK.
     - Remove any instances.

   * - ``ClientResetError.isFatal``
     - Not needed. Always ``true``.
     - Remove any instances.

   * - ``ClientResetError.sessionErrorCode``
     - Consolidated into ``SyncErrorCode`` in SDK v1.6.0.
     - Use ``SyncErrorCode`` enum. See also the
       :flutter-sdk:`SyncError <realm/SyncErrorCode.html>` API reference.

   * - ``Realm.logger.level``
     - Replaced by ``Realm.logger.setLogLevel``.
     - Replace any instances. See also :ref:`flutter-logging`.

   * - ``RealmProperty.indexed``
     - Replaced by ``RealmProperty.indexType``.
     - Replace any instances.

   * - ``RealmValue.type``
     - Changed to an enum of ``RealmValueType``.
     - Replace any instances. See also :ref:`RealmValue Data Type <flutter-realm-value>`.

   * - ``RealmValue.uint8List``
     - Renamed to ``RealmValue.binary``.
     - Replace any instances. See also :ref:`RealmValue Data Type <flutter-realm-value>`.

   * - ``SchemaObject.properties``
     - ``SchemaObject`` changed to an iterable collection of ``SchemaProperty``.
     - Replace any instances. See also the
       :flutter-sdk:`SchemaObject <realm/SchemaObject-class.html>` API reference.

   * - ``SyncError`` constructor and ``SyncError.create`` factory
     - Sync errors should only be created internally by the SDK.
     - Remove any instances.

   * - ``SyncClientError``, ``SyncConnectionError``, ``SyncSessionError``,
       ``SyncResolveError``, ``SyncWebSocketError``, and ``GeneralSyncError``
     - Consolidated into ``SyncError`` in SDK v1.6.0.
     - Use ``SyncError`` or its subclasses. See also the
       :flutter-sdk:`SyncError <realm/SyncErrorCode.html>` API reference.

   * - ``SyncErrorCategory``, ``SyncClientErrorCode``, ``SyncConnectionErrorCode``,
       ``SyncSessionErrorCode``, ``SyncResolveErrorCode``,``SyncWebsocketErrorCode``,
       and ``GeneralSyncErrorCode``
     - Consolidated into ``SyncErrorCode`` in SDK v1.6.0.
     - Use ``SyncErrorCode`` enum. See also the
       :flutter-sdk:`SyncError <realm/SyncErrorCode.html>` API reference.

   * - ``SyncError.codeValue``, ``SyncError.category``, and ``SyncError.detailedMessage``
     - Consolidated into ``SyncError`` in SDK v1.6.0. Messages were unused.
     - Remove any category or message instances. Replace ``SyncError.codeValue``
       with ``SyncError.code.code``. See also the
       :flutter-sdk:`SyncError <realm/SyncErrorCode.html>` API reference.

   * - ``SyncProgress.transferredBytes`` and ``SyncProgress.transferableBytes``
     - Reported transferred and transferable values were incorrect. Consolidated
       into a new ``SyncProgress.progressEstimate`` metric.
     - Use ``SyncProgress.progressEstimate``. See also :ref:`flutter-monitor-sync-progress`.

   * - ``User.provider``
     - Provider is associated with each identity, so value was incorrect
       for users with more than one identity.
     - Remove any instances.
