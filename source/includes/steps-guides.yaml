title: "Add guides to your sphinx extensions."
ref: add-guides
content: |
  Add ``guides`` to the extensions list in ``conf.py`` in your repo
  root.

  .. code-block:: sh

     extensions = [
       'sphinx.ext.extlinks',
       'sphinx.ext.todo',
       'mongodb',
       'directives',
       'intermanual',
       'testcode',
       'tabs',
       'markdown',

       'source_constants',
       'icon'
       'guides'
     ]

title: Copy the guides directive template into a file in your repo.
ref: copy-guide
content: |
  Copy the following directive template into a file to begin
  writing your guide. Make sure it's under the source directory and
  give it a ``.txt`` extension. Otherwise it won't build.

  .. note::

     While the spacing makes this example look a bit like a ``.yaml``
     file, it's really a Sphinx directive. This guide should compile
     as-is.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     .. guide::

  Now it's time to fill in the fields in the template to create your

  (``tabs-drivers``) to toggle.

     :widths: 10 20 70

title: Document the content with steps required to complete the tutorial
ref: make-steps
content: |
  Document the steps required for your guide. If you'd like content
  with numbered steps, use a step file.

  Step files are ``.yaml`` files that get converted during the build
  process to ``.rst`` files and are included as
  ``/<dir>/steps/<something>.rst``. When you create the ``.yaml`` step
  file, name it according to the convention:

  .. note::

     Guides use headings to delineate sections. If you would like to
     provide subsections for your guides sections, use subheadings.

  .. code-block:: sh

     <dir>/steps-<something>.yaml

  Here is an example of a ``.yaml`` steps file.

  .. note::

     You can nest ``include`` directives within the ``step`` content if
     you wish.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     title: Find the ``mongo`` Shell
     ref: mongo-shell
     content: |

       The ``mongo`` shell is packaged with the MongoDB Server
       Community and Enterprise distributions, and is also available
       for users of Atlas as a client-only download.

       If you do not have ``mongo`` shell installed, follow the
       install directions for your environment.

       .. include:: /includes/guides/download-shell-tabs.rst

     title: Connect to your MongoDB instance
     ref: connect
     content: |

       .. include:: /includes/guides/mongo-shell-platform-connect-np.rst

title: Add What's Next and See Also (optional) sections
ref: whats-next
content: |

  The **What's Next** and **See Also** sections are important for
  leading the reader to the next step in their learning.

  Add links to other tutorials in the **What's Next** section and
  save **See Also** for content that links out of the tutorial format
  such as in-depth manual content and reference material.

  If you have ``:manual:`` in your ``conf.py`` as an extlink map, you
  can use:

  .. code-block:: sh

     :manual:`short description </reference/blah>`

  Or for content that lives in your own repo, feel free to use:

  .. code-block:: sh

     :doc:`Some Local Content </localdir/localcontent>`

  External links or links referenced from outside of a repo with
  shortcuts configured can be referenced using the fully qualified url:

  .. code-block:: sh

     `Site to link to <http://fully.qualified.domain/stuff>`__.

title: Add the Guide to a Table of Contents
ref: add-to-toc
content: |

  To add the guide to a table of contents, use the same method you
  would use for any standard docs content.

  In the ``.txt`` file for the TOC in question, add the link.

  .. code-block:: rst

     .. toctree::
        :titlesonly:

        /images-guide
        /tutorials/screencapture-tool
        /tutorials/tabbed-content
        /tutorials/version-bumping
        /tutorials/generating-a-browser-list
        /error-kb
        /tutorials/guide
