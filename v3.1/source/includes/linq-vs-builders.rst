.. tip:: LINQ or Builders?

   If you're used to programming in {+language+}, consider using LINQ because of its similar feel
   to programming in native {+language+}. If you have prior experience with other MongoDB drivers,
   consider using ``Builder`` classes because of their consistency with other drivers.

   We encourage experimenting with both approaches to determine the most suitable mechanism
   for your purposes.
