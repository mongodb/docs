   .. step:: Create a file named ``create-embeddings.go`` and paste the following code.
            
      Use the following code to generate embeddings from an existing
      collection in |service|. Specifically, this code does the following:

      - Connects to your |service| {+cluster+}.

      - Gets a subset of documents from the 
        ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`` collection that 
        have a non-empty ``summary`` field.

      - Generates embeddings from each document's ``summary`` field
        by using the ``GetEmbeddings`` function that you defined.

      - Updates each document with a new ``embeddings`` field 
        that contains the embedding value by using the MongoDB 
        :driver:`Go Driver </go/>`.

   .. step:: Create a file that contains Go models for the collection.

      To simplify marshalling and unmarshalling Go objects to and from BSON,
      create a file that contains models for the documents in this collection.

      a. Move into the ``common`` directory.
