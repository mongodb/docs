To enable `BI Connector for Atlas

toggle :guilabel:`Enable Business Intelligence Connector (M10 and
up)` to :guilabel:`Yes`.

If enabled, select the node type from which |bic|
should read.

Read Preferences
----------------

The following table describes the available read preferences for
|bic-short| and their corresponding
:manual:`readPreference </reference/read-preference>` and
:manual:`readPreferenceTag </core/read-preference-tags>`
connection string options.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 30 20 30

   * - |bic-short-no-link| Read Preference
     - Description
     - readPreference
     - readPreferenceTags

   * - Primary
     - Read from the :term:`primary` node.
     - ``primary``
     - None

   * - Secondary
     - Read from :term:`secondary` nodes.
     - ``secondary``
     - ``{ nodeType : ELECTABLE }`` or ``{ nodeType : READ_ONLY }``

   * - Analytics
     - Read from :term:`analytics nodes <analytics node>`.
     - ``secondary``
     - ``{ nodeType : ANALYTICS }``

Node Types
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``nodeType`` read preference tag dictates the type of node |bic|
connects to. The possible values for this option are as follows:

- ``ELECTABLE`` restricts |bic-short| to the :term:`primary` and
  electable :term:`secondary` nodes.

- ``READ_ONLY`` restricts |bic-short| to connecting to
  non-electable :term:`secondary` nodes.

- ``ANALYTICS`` restricts |bic-short| to connecting to
  :ref:`analytics nodes <analytics-nodes-overview>`.

  .. tip::

     When using the :guilabel:`Analytics` read preference, |service|
     places |bic| on the same hardware as the analytics nodes from which
     |bic| reads.

     By isolating electable data-bearing nodes from the |bic|, electable
     nodes do not compete for resources with |bic|, thus improving
     cluster reliability and performance.

For high traffic production environments, connecting to the
:guilabel:`Secondary Node(s)` or :guilabel:`Analytics Node(s)` may
be preferable to connecting to the :guilabel:`Primary Node`.

For clusters with one or more
:ref:`analytics nodes <analytics-nodes-overview>`, select
:guilabel:`Analytics Node` to isolate |bic| queries from
your operational workload and read from dedicated, read-only
analytics nodes. With this option, electable nodes do not compete
for resources with |bic|, thus improving cluster reliability and
performance.

Sampling Settings
-----------------

The |bic-short-no-link| generates a relational schema by
:bic:`sampling data </schema/cached-sampling/>` from MongoDB. The
following sampling settings are configurable:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 10 65
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - |bic-short-no-link| Option
     - Type
     - Description

   * - Schema Sample Size
     - integer
     - *Optional.* The number of documents that the BI Connector
       samples for each database when gathering schema information.
       For more information, see the
       :bic:`BI Connector documentation </reference/mongosqld/#cmdoption-mongosqld-samplesize>`.

   * - Sample Refresh Interval
     - integer
     - *Optional.* The frequency, in seconds, at which the BI
       Connector re-samples data to recreate the schema. For more
       information, see the
       :bic:`BI Connector documentation </reference/mongosqld/#cmdoption-mongosqld-samplerefreshintervalsecs>`.
