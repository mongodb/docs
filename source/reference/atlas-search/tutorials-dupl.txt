The following tutorials take you through the steps of setting up and 
querying an |fts| index. 

Prerequisites 
-------------

To complete these tutorials, you must have the following: 

- An |service| cluster with MongoDB version 4.2 or higher.

- The :doc:`sample datasets </sample-data>` loaded into your |service| 
  cluster. You will use a collection with movie data from the |service| 
  sample dataset.

- {+mongosh+} on your local machine.

About the Tutorials 
-------------------

- The :ref:`autocomplete-tutorial` tutorial describes how to create and 
  query an |fts| index configured with an ``autocomplete`` field using 
  the ``autocomplete`` operator. We will create the |fts| index on the 
  ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection and index the ``title`` field text 
  values for autocompletion. We will run |fts| queries using 
  the ``autocomplete`` operator to search the indexed field for a 
  sequence of characters.

- The :ref:`facet-tutorial` tutorial describes how to create an index 
  with a facet definition for the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection 
  and run queries against the faceted fields for results grouped by 
  values and ranges in the specified, faceted fields, including a 
  count for each of those groups.

- The :ref:`synonyms-tutorial` tutorial describes how to add a 
  collection that configures words as synonyms, create an index that 
  defines synonym mappings on the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection, 
  and run |fts| queries against the ``title`` field using words that 
  are configured as synonyms.
