":program:`mongoreplay` is a traffic capture and replay tool for MongoDB "

":program:`mongoreplay` can help you preview how your MongoDB deployment "
"will perform a production workload under a different environment, such as"
" with a different storage engine, on different hardware, or with a "
"different operating system configuration. :program:`mongoreplay` can also"
" help reproduce and investigate an issue by recording and replaying the "
"operations that trigger the issue. Finally, :program:`mongoreplay` serves"
" as a more flexible version of the legacy ``mongosniff`` tool to help you"
