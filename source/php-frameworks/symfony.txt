Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the Symfony MongoDB integration and
how to use this framework to build a simple PHP web application. You can
read about the benefits of using Symfony to build
web applications with MongoDB as your database and practice using libraries
that simplify querying MongoDB.

`Symfony <https://symfony.com/>`__ is a flexible and highly configurable
framework for building PHP applications. You can use this framework to
create reusable components to streamline your web app.

The :ref:`php-symfony-qs` section of this guide contains a tutorial
which you can follow to build a single page app that accesses data from
a MongoDB collection.

The :ref:`php-symfony-resources` section contains links to resources and
documentation for further learning.

Why Use MongoDB in a Symfony Application?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By using MongoDB as a data store in a Symfony web application, you can
leverage the document data model to build rich query expressions,
allowing you to easily interact with data. You can also customize your
connections to persist and access data to and from multiple databases
and collections.

In your applications, you can implement the **Doctrine MongoDB ODM**,
which is an Object-Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB and PHP. It
provides a way to work with MongoDB in Symfony, using the same
principles as Doctrine ORM for relational databases.

Doctrine ODM allows you to map PHP objects to MongoDB documents
and query MongoDB by using a builder API. This mapping enables you to
use other MongoDB features such as flexible schema design and advanced
searches. To learn more about this library, see the
:ref:`php-symfony-resources` section.

Quick Start
-----------

This tutorial shows you how to build a web application by using Symfony, a
PHP framework. It includes instructions on connecting to a MongoDB cluster hosted
on MongoDB Atlas and accessing and displaying data from your database.

By using MongoDB as a data store in a Symfony web application, you can
leverage the document data model to build rich query expressions,
allowing you to easily interact with data.

.. tip::

   If you prefer to connect to MongoDB by using the MongoDB PHP Library without
   Symfony, see `Connecting to MongoDB
   <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current/tutorial/connecting/>`__
   in the MongoDB PHP Library documentation.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your
MongoDB deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card
required) MongoDB Atlas deployment by following the steps in this guide.

This guide uses Doctrine ODM to allow you to map PHP objects to
MongoDB documents and query MongoDB by using a builder API. 

Follow the steps in this guide to create a sample Symfony web application
that connects to a MongoDB deployment and performs a query on the
database.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create the Quick Start application, you need the following software
installed in your development environment:

- `PHP <https://www.php.net/downloads>`__
- `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/download/>`__
- `Symfony CLI <https://symfony.com/download>`__
- A terminal app and shell. For MacOS users, use Terminal or a similar app.
  For Windows users, use PowerShell.

.. _php-symfony-atlas-cluster:

Create a MongoDB Atlas Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must create a MongoDB cluster where you can store and manage your
data. Complete the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>`
guide to set up a new Atlas account and create a free tier MongoDB
cluster. This tutorial also demonstrates how to load sample datasets
into your cluster, including the data that is used in this tutorial.

You provide instructions to the driver on where and how to connect to your
MongoDB cluster by providing it with a connection string. To retrieve
your connection string, follow the instructions in the :atlas:`Connect
to Your Cluster </tutorial/connect-to-your-cluster/>` tutorial in the
Atlas documentation.

.. tip::

   Save your connection string in a secure location.

Install MongoDB Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To learn more about installing the MongoDB extension, see the `Get
Started with the PHP Library
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current/get-started/#download-and-install>`__ tutorial.

Initialize a Symfony Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following command to create a skeleton Symfony project called
``restaurants``:

.. code-block:: bash

   composer create-project symfony/skeleton restaurants

Install PHP Driver and Doctrine ODM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enter your project directory, then add the MongoDB PHP driver and the
Doctrine ODM bundle to your application. The bundle integrates
the ODM library into Symfony so that you can read from and write objects
to MongoDB. Installing the bundle also automatically adds the driver to
your project. To learn more, see the :ref:`php-symfony-resources` section
of this guide.

Run the following commands to install the ODM:

.. code-block:: bash

   composer require doctrine/mongodb-odm-bundle

.. tip::

   After running the preceding commands, you might see the
   following prompt:

   .. code-block:: bash
      :copyable: false

      Do you want to execute this recipe?

   Select ``yes`` from the response options to add the ODM library to your
   application.

To ensure that Doctrine ODM is enabled in your project, verify that your
``config/bundles.php`` file contains the highlighted entry in the
following code:

.. code-block:: php
   :caption: config/bundles.php
   :emphasize-lines: 3
   
   return [
       // ...
       Doctrine\Bundle\MongoDBBundle\DoctrineMongoDBBundle::class => ['all' => true],
   ];

Configure the ODM
`````````````````

In the ``config/packages`` directory, replace the contents of your
``doctrine_mongodb.yaml`` file with the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/php-frameworks/symfony/doctrine_mongodb.yaml
   :caption: config/packages/doctrine_mongodb.yaml
   :language: yaml

Install Frontend Dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project uses ``twig``, the default template engine for Symfony, to
generate templates in this application. Run the following command to
install the ``twig`` bundle:

.. code-block::

   composer require symfony/twig-bundle

.. note::

   This step might result in an error message about unset environment
   variables, but this issue is resolved in the following steps.

Modify Project Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section demonstrates how to modify the files in your
``restaurants`` project to create a Symfony web application that displays
restaurants that match the specified criteria.

Set Environment Variables
`````````````````````````

In the root directory, navigate to the ``.env`` file and define the
following environment variables to set your connection string and target
database:

.. code-block:: none
   :caption: .env

   ...

   MONGODB_URL=<your Atlas connection string>
   MONGODB_DB=sample_restaurants

To retrieve your connection string, see the
:ref:`php-symfony-atlas-cluster` step.

Create Restaurant Entity and Controller
```````````````````````````````````````

Create the ``Restaurant.php`` file in the ``src/Document`` directory and
paste the following code to create an entity that represents documents in
the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/php-frameworks/symfony/Restaurant.php
   :caption: src/Document/Restaurant.php
   :language: php

Next, create the ``RestaurantController.php`` file in the
``src/Controller`` directory and paste the following code to handle the
endpoints in your application:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/php-frameworks/symfony/RestaurantController.php
   :caption: src/Controller/RestaurantController.php
   :language: php

The controller file defines the ``index()`` method, which displays text on
the web app's front page. The file also defines the ``browse()`` method,
which finds documents in which the ``borough``
field is ``'Queens'`` and the ``name`` field contains the string ``'Moon'``.
This method then displays the documents at the ``/restaurant/browse/`` route. The
``browse()`` method uses the ``QueryBuilder`` class to construct the query.

Customize Templates
```````````````````

Next, create templates to customize the web app's appearance.

Create the ``templates/restaurant`` directory and populate it with the
following files:

- ``index.html.twig``
- ``browse.html.twig``

Paste the following code into the ``index.html.twig`` file:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/php-frameworks/symfony/index.html.twig
   :caption: templates/restaurant/index.html.twig
   :language: html

Paste the following code into the ``browse.html.twig`` file:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/php-frameworks/symfony/browse.html.twig
   :caption: templates/restaurant/browse.html.twig
   :language: html

Start your Symfony Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following command from the application root directory to start
your PHP built-in web server:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   symfony server:start

After the server starts, it outputs the following message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [OK] Web server listening
        The Web server is using PHP FPM 8.3.4
        http://127.0.0.1:8000

Open the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/restaurant/browse in your web browser.
The page shows a list of restaurants and details about each of them, as
displayed in the following screenshot:

.. figure:: /includes/php-frameworks/symfony/app_render.png
   :alt: Restaurants web app screenshot

Congratulations on completing the Quick Start tutorial!

After you complete these steps, you have a Symfony web application that
connects to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on the sample data,
and renders a retrieved result.
