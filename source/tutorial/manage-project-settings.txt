View/Modify Project Settings
----------------------------

Project settings apply to all the users in the project
[#user-settings]_. The :guilabel:`Project ID` displayed at the top of
the page is used by the Atlas |api|.

You can set the following:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting

     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Project`

     - Sets your project's name.

       .. note::

          Only a user with ``Owner`` role for the project or the
          ``Organization Owner`` role for the project's organization
          can edit the project name.

   * - :guilabel:`Project Time Zone`

     - Sets your project's time zone. This does not affect the
       timezones set for individual user accounts. [#user-settings]_

   * - :guilabel:`Connect via Peering Only (GCP and Azure)`

     - Allows you to enable or disable connections between MongoDB |service| dedicated clusters 
       and public |ipaddr| addresses outside of the peered |vpc|/VNet. You can only disable 
       this setting when there are no active dedicated GCP or Azure clusters in your Project.

   * - :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics`

     - Allows you to enable or disable the collection of database
       statistics in :doc:`cluster metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics>`.


   * - :guilabel:`Set Preferred Cluster Maintenance Start Time`

     - Set which hour of the day that |service| should start weekly
       maintenance on your cluster.

       If you toggle to :guilabel:`On`, click :icon:`pencil-alt` to set
       the :guilabel:`Maintenance Start Time`. |service| displays this
       time in the time zone you set in your :guilabel:`Profile`.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-urgent-maintenance.rst

       When maintenance is required, a banner appears in your cluster
       list showing the day and time when the maintenance is
       scheduled. With this information, you can choose
       one of three options:

       1. Do nothing. The maintenance occurs during your scheduled
          maintenance window.
       2. :guilabel:`Begin Maintenance Now`. The scheduled maintenance
          starts immediately. If you choose this option, you are asked to confirm it in a 
          separate modal.
       3. :guilabel:`Defer Maintenance for One Week`. The scheduled
          maintenance starts during your preferred maintenance window
          one week after the given scheduled maintenance date and
          time. If you choose this option, you are asked to confirm it
          in a separate modal.

   * - :guilabel:`Real Time Performance Panel`

     - Allows you to see real time metrics from your MongoDB database.

   * - :guilabel:`Data Explorer`

     - Allows you to query your database with an easy to use interface.

   * - :guilabel:`Performance Advisor`

     - Allows you to analyze database logs to recommend performance improvements.

   * - :guilabel:`Delete Project`

     - The ``DELETE`` button allows you to delete a project.

   * - :guilabel:`PagerDuty Service Key`

     - Sets a default service key for alert notifications sent to a
       `PagerDuty <http://www.pagerduty.com/?utm_source=mongodb&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partner>`_
       account. |service| enters the key by default when you add a
       PagerDuty notification to an :doc:`alert configuration
       </monitoring-alerts>`. If you add PagerDuty notifications and if
       the key used to send the notifications becomes invalid,
       |service| sends an email to the project owner and eventually
       removes the key.

       You can add PagerDuty notifications only for alerts that require
       user acknowledgement. Informational alerts, such as the alert
       that a user has joined a project, cannot use this notification
       method.

       Users can acknowledge PagerDuty alerts only from the PagerDuty
       dashboard.

   * - :guilabel:`Flowdock Settings`

     - Sets default values for alert notifications sent to Flowdock.
       |service| enters the values by default when you add a Flowdock
       notification to an
       :doc:`alert configuration </monitoring-alerts>`. If you add
       Flowdock notifications, and if credentials to send notifications
       become invalid, |service| sends an email to the project owner
       and eventually removes the credentials.

       Set the following:

       .. list-table::
          :widths: 20 80

          * - :guilabel:`Org Name`

            - The Flowdock organization name in lower-case letters.
              This is the name that appears after
              ``www.flowdock.com/app/`` in the URL string.

          * - :guilabel:`Flow Name`

            - The flow name in lower-case letters. The flow name
              appears after the organization name in the URL string:

              ``www.flowdock.com/app/<organization-name>/<flow-name>``

          * - :guilabel:`API Token`

            - Your Flowdock "personal API token" found on the
              `<https://www.flowdock.com/account/tokens>`_ page of your
              Flowdock account.

   * - :guilabel:`HipChat Settings`

     - Sets a default room and API token for alert notifications sent
       to a HipChat account. |service| enters the values by default
       when you add a HipChat notification to an :doc:`alert
       configuration </monitoring-alerts>`. If you add HipChat
       notifications and the token used to send notifications becomes
       invalid, |service| sends an email to the project owner and
       eventually removes the token.


   * - :guilabel:`Slack Settings`

     - Sets a default channel and token for alert notifications sent to
       a Slack account. You can use either an API token or a Bot token.
       To create an API token, see the `<https://api.slack.com/web>`_
       page in your Slack account. For information on Bot users in
       Slack, see `<https://api.slack.com/bot-users>`_.

       |service| enters these values by default when you add a Slack
       notification to an :doc:`alert configuration
       </monitoring-alerts>`. If add Slack notifications and the token
       used to send notifications becomes invalid, |service| sends an
       email to the project owner and eventually removes the token.

   * - :guilabel:`Webhook Settings`

     - Adds a :guilabel:`Webhook URL` endpoint to which |service| can
       send alert notifications for programmatic processing. |service|
       sends an alert notification as an HTTP POST request. The request
       body contains a JSON document that uses the same format as the
       Public API's ``Alerts`` resource.

       |service| adds a request header called ``X-MMS-Event`` to
       distinguish between various alert states. The possible values
       for this header are:

       .. list-table::
          :widths: 30 70

          * - ``alert.open``

            - The alert was just opened.

          * - ``alert.close``

            - The alert was resolved.

          * - ``alert.update``

            - A previously opened alert is still open.

          * - ``alert.acknowledge``

            - The alert was acknowledged.

          * - ``alert.cancel``

            - The alert became invalid and was canceled.

          * - ``alert.inform``

            - Represents an informational alert, which is a
              point-in-time event, such as "Primary Elected."

       If you specify a key in the :guilabel:`Webhook Secret` field,
       |service| adds the ``X-MMS-Signature`` request header, which
       contains the hex-encoded HMAC signature of the request body. The
       signature is created using the provided secret.

       To send alert notifications to a Webhook, select the Webhook
       notification option when creating or editing an :doc:`alert
       </monitoring-alerts>`. If you add a Webhook notification and the
       URL or optional key becomes invalid, |service| sends an email to
       the project owner and eventually removes the Webhook settings.

   * - :guilabel:`VictorOps Settings`

     - Sets an API key and Routing key for alert notifications sent
       to a VictorOps account. This will be used as the default VictorOps settings 
       when configuring alerts. 

       Enter the following information from your VictorOps account. If
       you do not have an existing VictorOps account, you can sign up
       using `<https://help.victorops.com/knowledge-base/new-user-sign/>`_.

       - VictorOps API Key
       - VictorOps Routing Key (optional)


   * - :guilabel:`OpsGenie API Key`

     - Sets an API key for alert notifications sent to an OpsGenie account. This will 
       be used as the default OpsGenie API key when configuring alerts. 

       Enter the following information from your OpsGenie account. If
       you do not have an existing OpsGenie account, you can sign up
       using `<https://www.opsgenie.com/signup>`_ :

       - OpsGenie API Key

   * - :guilabel:`New Relic Settings`

     - Configures |service| to send metric data about your deployment
       to `New Relic <http://newrelic.com/>`_ for viewing through the
       New Relic MongoDB plugin. You can also use Insights for New
       Relic to run analytics on the collected data. |service| sends
       New Relic the same metric data as displayed in |service|
       :doc:`cluster metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics>`.

       Enter the following information from your New Relic account. If
       you do not have an existing New Relic account, you can sign up
       using `<http://newrelic.com/mongodb>`_.

       - Account ID
       - License Key
       - Insights API Insert Key
       - Insights API Query Key

       If any of the keys later become invalid, |service| sends an
       email to the project owner and eventually removes the invalid
       credentials.

   * - :guilabel:`Datadog Settings`

     - Configures |service| to send metric data about your deployment
       to |datadog|. You can view these metrics in your Datadog
       dashboards. For a detailed list of all |service| metrics
       that Datadog tracks, refer to the
       :ref:`Datadog Integration <datadog-integration>` page.

       Enter your :guilabel:`Datadog API Key` to have Datadog begin
       tracking your |service| metric data. If you do not have an
       existing Datadog account, you can sign up at
       `<https://app.datadoghq.com/signup>`__.
