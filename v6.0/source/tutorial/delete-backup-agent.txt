View Active Agents
------------------

To view your active Backup Agents, click :guilabel:`Deployment`, then the
:guilabel:`Agents` tab, then :guilabel:`All Agents`.
The page displays agents that have been active
in the last 24 hours. If an agent fails to report to |mms| for more than 24
hours, |mms| removes the agent from this page.

Remove from |mms|
-----------------

To remove a Backup Agent from |mms|, :ref:`stop the agent
<stop-backup-agent>` and then wait 24 hours.

Delete from the Server
----------------------

To delete the Backup Agent **from a Linux or OSX server**, :ref:`stop the
agent <stop-backup-agent>` and then remove the ``mongodb-mms-backup-agent``
file from the ``/usr/bin`` directory. If you installed the agent using a
``tar.gz`` file, the agent will be in the directory you chose during
installation.

To delete the Backup Agent **from a Windows server**, :ref:`stop the agent
<stop-backup-agent-windows>` and then use the Windows program uninstaller to
remove the ``MongoDB Backup Agent`` program.
