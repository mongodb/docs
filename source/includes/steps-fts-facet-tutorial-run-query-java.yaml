title: "Run an |fts| facet query that groups the genre and year fields
       into buckets."
content: |
  
  a. Create a file named ``FacetQuery.java``.
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the ``FacetQuery.java`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:

     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Uses the following searchMeta clauses to query the collection: 

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/fts-facet-constant-desc.rst 

     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.
     
     .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts-tutorial/facet/tutorial.java
        :language: java
        :linenos:
        :dedent:

     .. note:: 

        To run the sample code in your Maven environment, add the 
        following above the import statements in your file.

        .. code-block:: 

           package com.mongodb.drivers;

  #. .. include:: /includes/fact-fts-driver-connection-string.rst
  #. Compile and run ``FacetQuery.java`` file.

     .. code-block:: shell 

        javac FacetQuery.java
        java FacetQuery

  When you run ``FacetQuery.java``, the program prints 
  the following documents to your terminal:
  
  .. code-block:: json 
     :copyable: false 

     {"count": {"lowerBound": 23026}, 
      "facet": {
        "genresFacet": {
          "buckets": [
            {"_id": "Drama", "count": 13527}, 
            {"_id": "Comedy", "count": 6922}, 
            {"_id": "Romance", "count": 3615}, 
            {"_id": "Crime", "count": 2649}, 
            {"_id": "Thriller", "count": 2603}, 
            {"_id": "Action", "count": 2505}, 
            {"_id": "Documentary", "count": 2041}, 
            {"_id": "Adventure", "count": 2016}, 
            {"_id": "Horror", "count": 1662}, 
            {"_id": "Biography", "count": 1373}]}, 
        "yearFacet": {
          "buckets": [
            {"_id": 1910, "count": 23}, 
            {"_id": 1920, "count": 89}, 
            {"_id": 1930, "count": 308}]}}}
