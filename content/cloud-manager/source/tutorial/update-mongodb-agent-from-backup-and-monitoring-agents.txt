===================================================

.. meta::
   :description: Update your MongoDB deployment to the MongoDB Agent from legacy Backup and Monitoring Agents, ensuring compatibility with Cloud Manager.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You have a project with monitored and backed up MongoDB deployments
that Automation did not manage and want to update to the {+mdbagent+}.

.. include:: /includes/fact-check-prereq-before-updating-to-mongodb-agent.rst

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/choice-update-mongodb-agent-backup-and-monitoring.rst

Next Steps
----------

After the {+mdbagent+} update completes:

- If Automation did not previously manage your Monitoring and/or
  Backup Agents, activate :ref:`{+bagent+} <activate-backup>`
  and/or :ref:`{+magent+} <activate-monitoring>` on your MongoDB
  deployment.

- If Automation did previously manage your Monitoring and/or Backup
  Agents, they are now activated. To verify that they
  are activated:
  
  .. procedure::
     :style: normal

     .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-deployment.rst

     .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-servers.rst

- If you want to activate {+aagent+},
  :ref:`add a deployment <activate-automation>` to your MongoDB
  project.

- :ref:`Stop <stop-monitoring-agent>` and
  :doc:`remove </tutorial/delete-monitoring-agent>` the legacy
  Monitoring Agent.

- :ref:`Stop <stop-backup-agent>` and
  :doc:`remove </tutorial/delete-backup-agent>` the legacy Backup
  Agent.
