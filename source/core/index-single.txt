MongoDB provides complete support for indexes on any field in a
:term:`collection` of :term:`documents <document>`. By default, all
collections have an index on the :ref:`_id field <index-type-id>`, and
applications and users may add additional indexes to support important
queries and operations.

This document describes ascending/descending indexes on a single field.

Create an Ascending Index on a Single Field
-------------------------------------------

Consider a collection named ``records`` that holds documents that
resemble the following sample document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id": ObjectId("570c04a4ad233577f97dc459"),
     "score": 1034,
     "location": { state: "NY", city: "New York" }
   }

The following operation creates an ascending index on the ``score``
field of the ``records`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.createIndex( { score: 1 } )

.. include:: /includes/fact-index-specification-field-value.rst

The created index will support queries that select on the field
``score``, such as the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.find( { score: 2 } )
   db.records.find( { score: { $gt: 10 } } )

.. index:: index; embedded fields
.. _index-embedded-fields:
.. _index-subdocuments:
.. _index-embedded-documents:

Create an Index on an Embedded Field
------------------------------------

You can create indexes on fields within embedded documents, just as you
can index top-level fields in documents. Indexes on embedded fields
differ from :ref:`indexes on embedded documents <index-embedded-documents>`,
which include the full content up to the maximum :limit:`index size
<Index Key>` of the embedded document in the index. Instead, indexes on
embedded fields allow you to use a "dot notation," to introspect into
embedded documents.

Consider a collection named ``records`` that holds documents that
resemble the following sample document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id": ObjectId("570c04a4ad233577f97dc459"),
     "score": 1034,
     "location": { state: "NY", city: "New York" }
   }

The following operation creates an index on the ``location.state``
field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.createIndex( { "location.state": 1 } )

The created index will support queries that select on the field
``location.state``, such as the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.find( { "location.state": "CA" } )
   db.records.find( { "location.city": "Albany", "location.state": "NY" } )

Create an Index on Embedded Document
------------------------------------

You can also create indexes on embedded document as a whole.

Consider a collection named ``records`` that holds documents that
resemble the following sample document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id": ObjectId("570c04a4ad233577f97dc459"),
     "score": 1034,
     "location": { state: "NY", city: "New York" }
   }

The ``location`` field is an embedded document, containing the embedded fields
``city`` and ``state``. The following command creates an index on the ``location``
field as a whole:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.createIndex( { location: 1 } )

The following query can use the index on the ``location`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.find( { location: { city: "New York", state: "NY" } } )

.. note:: Although the query can use the index, the result set does not
   include the sample document above. When performing equality matches on
   embedded documents, field order matters and the embedded documents
   must match exactly. See :ref:`query-embedded-documents` for more
   information regarding querying on embedded documents.
