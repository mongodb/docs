      * - :guilabel:`Take snapshots every ... hours and save for ... days`

        - Sets how frequently, in hours, |mms| takes a base snapshot of
          the deployment and the number of days |mms| retains base
          snapshots.

          .. include:: /includes/extracts/snapshot-schedule-changes-and-pricing.rst

      * - :guilabel:`Create cluster checkpoint every ... minutes`
          (Sharded Clusters only)

        - Sets how frequently, in minutes, |mms| creates a
          :ref:`checkpoint <checkpoint>` in between snapshots of a
          sharded cluster. Checkpoints provide restore points that you
          can use to create custom *point-in-time* snapshots.

          See :ref:`checkpoint`.

      * - :guilabel:`Store daily snapshots for`

        - Sets the number of days that |mms| retains daily snapshots.

      * - :guilabel:`Store weekly snapshots for`

        - Sets the number of weeks that |mms| retains weekly snapshots.

      * - :guilabel:`Store monthly snapshots for`

        - Sets the number of months that |mms| retains monthly snapshots.

      * - :guilabel:`Allow point-in-time restores going back`

        - Sets the number of days that |mms| retains oplogs alongside snapshots.

          See :doc:`/core/restore-overview` for how snapshots and point-in-time
          restores work.

      * - :guilabel:`Reference Time of Day (UTC)`

        - Sets the time of day at `UTC
          <https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html>`_ from which the
          snapshot schedule starts.

          .. note::
             If you change this value to a time of day that is before the
             current time of day, snapshots are skipped until the next day at
             this new time.

             .. example::

                It is currently 13:00 UTC. If you change the
                :guilabel:`Reference Time of Day (UTC)` to 10:00 UTC, all
                snapshots are suspended until tomorrow at 10:00 UTC.

             Snapshots in progress are unaffected. Only snapshots made after
             you change this value are affected.
