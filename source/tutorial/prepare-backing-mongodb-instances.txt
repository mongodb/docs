Preparing Backing MongoDB Instances
===================================

.. default-domain:: mms

Overview
--------

Backing MongoDB databases store the |mms| application data needed for operations. All
backing MongoDB databases must be running MongoDB 2.4.9 or later.

MMS Application Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install and run MMS Monitoring we recommend a single three-node
MongoDB replica set, at least 2 :program:`mongod` that hold data and one arbiter,
to store:

- Monitoring data collected from monitoring agents.

- Meta data for MMS users, groups, hosts, monitoring data, and backup state.

For up to 400 monitored hosts, the MMS Application Database requires 200 GB of storage space.
For up to 2000 monitored hosts, the MMS Application Database requires 500 GB of storage space.
If you have more than 2000 monitored hosts, please contact your MongoDB Account Manager.

This database is referenced in the ``<install_dir>/conf/conf-mms.properties`` file as follows:

.. code-block:: ini

   mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://host1:40000,host2:40000,host3:40000/?maxPoolSize=100
   mongo.replicaSet=mmsreplset

See :doc:`/reference/configuration` for more information on

You may run the MMS Application Server on the same physical server as
one node of the MMS Application Database replica set.

For reference: an AWS EC2 Standard Extra Large (i.e. m1.xlarge) with a
provisioned 500 IOP/s EBS volume may support the 400-host configuration
above. An AWS EC2 High I/O Quadruple Extra Large (hi1.4xlarge)
may support the 2000 host configuration above.

For the best results use SSD-backed storage. A MongoDB standalone may also be used in
please of a replica set, but this is not recommended for production deployments.

Optional: MMS Backup Blockstore Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install and run MMS Backup you will additionally need a second
MongoDB replica set in which to store the backup snapshot data. This
system should have enough capacity to store 2 to 3 times the total
backed up data size.

Prior to installing MMS Backup we strongly recommend that you contact
your MongoDB Account Manager to arrange a sizing consultation for the
MMS Backup database.

This database is referenced in the
``<install_dir>/conf/conf-mms.properties`` file as follows:

.. code-block:: ini

   mongo.backupdb.mongoUri=mongodb://host1:50000,host2:50000,host3:50000/?maxPoolSize=100
   mongo.backupdb.replicaSet=mmsbackupreplset

See :doc:`/reference/configuration` for more information on

A MongoDB standalone may also be used in  place of a replica set, but this is not
recommended for production deployments.

Prerequisites
-------------

Read the :manual:`MongoDB Production Notes
</administration/production-notes>` before installing
MongoDB and other software on your servers. If you are deploying MMS
on Amazon AWS, please see ::doc:`/tutorial/configure-aws-hosts`.

Setup and Install Replica Sets
------------------------------

To create replica sets, start the :program:`mongod` instances for each
member of a new replica set, configure the replica set, then add the
:program:`mongod` instances to the replica set.

The :manual:`Deploy a Replica Set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>` guide
has step by step details how to setup and deploy replica sets for use as
backing MongoDBs for MMS.

We recommend that both MMS Application Database and the MMS Backup Database
be configured as 3-node replica sets: two data nodes, and one arbiter.
