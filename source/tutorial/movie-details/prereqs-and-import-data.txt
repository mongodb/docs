Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial you will need a
`MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`_ cluster. Refer
to the :atlas:`Create a Cluster </create-new-cluster/>` documentation
for instructions on creating an |service| cluster.

Load the Sample Data into Your |service| Cluster
------------------------------------------------

|service| provides sample data you can load into your |service|
cluster. To load sample data into your cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/load-sample-data.rst

The dataset required for this tutorial is ``sample_mflix``. 
The following is a sample document from the dataset:

       count, and turned into one of his thralls, protecting him during his sea voyage to London. 
       After sucking the blood and turning the young Lucy Weston into a vampire, Dracula turns his
       attention to her friend Mina Seward, daughter of Dr. Seward who then calls in a specialist, 
       Dr. Van Helsing, to diagnose the sudden deterioration of Mina's health. Van Helsing, 
       realizing that Dracula is indeed a vampire, tries to prepare Mina's fiance, John Harker,

       Mina from becoming one of the undead.",

Now that you have a data source in |charts-short|, you
can :ref:`Create a New Dashboard <movie-data-new-dash>` which will
hold the visualizations.
