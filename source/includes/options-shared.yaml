  localhost:27017
directive: option
description: |
  Specifies a resolvable hostname for the :program:`mongod` to which to
  connect. By default, the {{program}} attempts to connect to a MongoDB
  instance running on the localhost on port number ``27017``.

  To connect to a replica set, specify the
  :setting:`~replication.replSetName` and a seed list of set members, as in
  the following:

  .. code-block:: none

     <replSetName>/<hostname1><:port>,<hostname2><:port>,<...>

  You can always connect directly to a single MongoDB instance by
  specifying the host and port number directly.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0.0
     If you use IPv6 and use the ``<address>:<port>`` format, you must
     enclose the portion of an address and port combination in
     brackets (e.g. ``[<address>]``).

  {{verb}} IPv6 support and allows {{program}} to connect to the

  TLS/SSL support enabled.

program: _shared
name: sslCAFile
# These are for the tools -- do not use these for the mongod/mongos/mongo shell

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains the root certificate chain
  from the Certificate Authority. Specify the file name of the
  :file:`.pem` file using relative or absolute paths.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-ssl-supported.rst

  .. warning::

     For SSL connections (``--ssl``) to :program:`mongod` and
     :program:`mongos`, if the {{program}} runs without the
     {{role}}, {{program}} will not attempt
     to validate the server certificates. This creates a vulnerability
     to expired :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` certificates as
     well as to foreign processes posing as valid :program:`mongod` or
     :program:`mongos` instances. Ensure that you *always* specify the
     CA file to validate the server certificates in cases where
     intrusion is a possibility.

program: _shared

# These are for the tools -- do not use these for the mongod/mongos/mongo shell

  .. versionadded:: 2.6

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains both the TLS/SSL certificate
  and key. Specify the file name of the :file:`.pem` file using relative
  or absolute paths.

  This option is required when using the :option:`--ssl` option to connect
  to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` that has
  :setting:`~net.ssl.CAFile` enabled *without*
  :setting:`~net.ssl.allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates`.

program: _shared

# These are for the tools -- do not use these for the mongod/mongos/mongo shell

description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.6

  Specifies the password to de-crypt the certificate-key file (i.e.
  :option:`--sslPEMKeyFile`). Use the {{role}} option only if the
  certificate-key file is encrypted. In all cases, the {{program}} will
  redact the password from all logging and reporting output.

  If the private key in the PEM file is encrypted and you do not specify
  the {{role}} option, the {{program}} will prompt for a passphrase. See
  :ref:`ssl-certificate-password`.

  .. versionadded:: 2.6

  Bypasses the validation checks for server certificates and allows
  the use of invalid certificates. When using the
  :setting:`~net.ssl.allowInvalidCertificates` setting, MongoDB logs as a
  warning the use of the invalid certificate.

program: _shared

# These are for the tools -- do not use these for mongod/mongos

  Disables the validation of the hostnames in TLS/SSL certificates. Allows
  {{program}} to connect to MongoDB instances even if the hostname in their
  certificates do not match the specified hostname.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-ssl-supported.rst
optional: true
