Prerequisites
-------------

To create the Quick Start application by using {+ror+} 8, you need the
following software installed in your development environment:

- `{+language+} language. <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/>`__
  Rails requires {+language+}  v3.1.0 or later. Use the latest version
  to prevent version conflicts.
- :rubygems:`RubyGems package manager. <pages/download>`
- A terminal app and shell. For MacOS users, use Terminal or a similar app.
  For Windows users, use PowerShell.

Download and Install the {+odm+} and Framework Gems
---------------------------------------------------

In {+language+}, packages are called **gems**.

Complete the following steps to install and add the {+odm+} and Rails
gems to your web application.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Install Rails

      Install the ``rails`` gem, which provides a command-line
      interface to create a basic application structure and application
      components.

      Run the following command to install ``rails``:

      .. code-block:: bash
         
         gem install rails

   .. step:: Create a Rails app with default scaffolding

      Run the following commands to create a new Rails application
      directory with default scaffolding and enter the application:

      .. code-block:: bash

         rails new {+quickstart-rails-app-name+} --skip-active-record
         cd {+quickstart-rails-app-name+}

      The ``--skip-active-record`` flag instructs Rails to not add
      Active Record as a dependency. You don't need this
      dependency because you will use {+odm+} instead.

      .. tip:: MacOS Installation Issue
      
         If you are using macOS, you might encounter issues when creating a
         new Rails app during the automatic bundle installation step.
         First, make sure that your macOS and `Xcode
         <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`__ versions are up to
         date. If you receive an error message similar to the following,
         you must update or configure your build tools:
      
         .. code-block:: none
            :copyable: false
      
            The compiler failed to generate an executable file.
            ...
            (RuntimeError) You have to install development tools first.
      
         Run the following commands to install Xcode command line tools:
      
         .. code-block:: bash
      
            xcode-select --install
            xcodebuild -license accept

         Then, try to run the ``bundle install`` command again.

   .. step:: Add the {+odm+} gem

      Open the ``Gemfile`` in your application and add the following
      entry:

      .. code-block:: ruby

         gem 'mongoid'

   .. step:: Install gems

      Run the following command to install the gems into your
      application:

      .. code-block:: bash

         gem install bundler
         bundle install

      When the command runs successfully, the output in your
      shell contains a ``Bundle complete!`` message and describes the
      number of new gems installed.

      After completing these steps, you have a new Rails web application with
      {+odm+} installed.
