|charts| offers several customization options which modify the
representation of a chart's X and Y value axes without affecting the
formatting of the data points in the visualization.

.. note::
  
   This page illustrates the value axis customization options which are
   available for most :ref:`chart types <chart-type-reference>`. Some
   chart types have other customization options which are noted on their
   individual documentation pages.

To access value axis customization options, expand the :guilabel:`Axes`
section of the :guilabel:`Customize` tab.

.. note::

   A value axis shows a continuous scale of values. Charts such as
   :ref:`Bar/Column <column-bar-chart-ref>` and
   :ref:`Discrete Line/Area <discrete-charts>` have just one
   value axis. :ref:`Continuous line and area <continuous-charts>`
   and :ref:`scatter <scatter-chart-ref>` charts have two value
   axes.

.. _max-min-options:

Max and Min
-----------

The :guilabel:`Max` and :guilabel:`Min` value axis options allow
you to specify maximum and minimum values to display on a chart.
Any data points with values outside the specified limits appear at
the boundaries of the chart. Setting a maximum display value
is useful for removing outlying data from the chart and
allowing the viewer to focus on more relevant information.

.. note::

   Changing the minimum for bar and column charts from the default
   of zero is not recommended. Doing so means the length of the
   bars is no longer proportional to the data point values.

The following chart types can use max and min: 

- all :ref:`Bar/Column <column-bar-chart-ref>` except 100% stacked
- :ref:`Discrete and Continuous Line <line-area-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Discrete and Continuous Area <discrete-charts>`
- :ref:`Scatter <scatter-chart-ref>`

.. _logarithmic-scale:

Logarithmic Scale
-----------------

Toggling the :guilabel:`Logarithmic Scale` switch to the
:guilabel:`On` position causes your chart
to use a logarithmic scale instead of a linear scale for data
values. Using a logarithmic scale is helpful for showing
the percentage change from one value to the next and for charts
with a large value differential from smallest to largest. Data sets
such as stock market movements, earthquake strength measurements, and
global population sizes are good use cases for a logarithmic scale
chart.

Logarithmic Scale Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use the :guilabel:`Logarithmic Scale` option only with chart data
  that consists of either all positive values or all negative values.
  If the chart includes a mix of positive and negative values, or if
  it includes the value ``0``, the chart will not render.

- Bar and column charts normally have a baseline of ``0``, but
  logarithmic scale charts have a baseline of ``1`` because
  ``log(0)`` is undefined. As a result, charts with data points between
  ``0`` and ``1`` do not render well. You can mitigate this effect by
  setting the :ref:`axis minimum <max-min-options>` of the chart to
  a value greater than zero but smaller than the lowest value in the
  data set.

The following chart types can use logarithmic scale: 

- :ref:`Grouped and Colored Bar/Column <column-bar-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Discrete and Continuous Line <line-area-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Scatter <scatter-chart-ref>`

.. _axes-label-override:

Label Override
--------------

The :guilabel:`Label Override` field allows you to create a
custom axis label. Custom labels can be more descriptive
than the default labels and help chart viewers quickly grasp
the significance of chart data.

The Label Override customization option is available on the ``X``
or ``Y`` value axis for charts in which the author has encoded multiple
data series by mapping more than one field on a given axis.
To customize the axis label for charts that have a single field mapped,
use the Label Override option within that field's customization
options.

The following chart types can use label override:

- :ref:`Bar/Column <column-bar-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Line <line-area-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Area <line-area-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Scatter <scatter-chart-ref>`

.. _secondary-y-axis:

Secondary Y Axis
----------------

If you map multiple :guilabel:`Aggregation` or :guilabel:`Value` fields
to the :guilabel:`Y axis`, you can plot one set of values on a secondary
Y axis. This customization option is useful for comparing two data series
with significantly different scales using the same chart.

   :figwidth: 251px
   :alt: Secondary Y axis customization

Usage
~~~~~

You can plot a secondary Y axis on the following chart types:

- :ref:`Grouped column <column-bar-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Discrete line <line-area-chart-ref>`
- :ref:`Continuous line <continuous-charts>`
- :ref:`Continuous area <continuous-charts>`

To plot a field on a secondary Y axis:

1. Click the :guilabel:`Customize` tab above the :ref:`encoding channels
   <encoding-channels>` in the :doc:`Chart Builder </build-charts>`.
#. Expand the :guilabel:`Fields` section of the :guilabel:`Customize` tab.
#. Select the field you want to plot on a secondary Y axis from the
   dropdown menu.
#. Set the :guilabel:`Plot on Secondary Axis` toggle switch to
   :guilabel:`On`.

After the secondary Y axis is enabled, you can customize its :ref:`value
axis options <value-axis-options>`.

When the secondary Y axis is used for at least one series, two separate
legends appear for the left Y axis and the right Y axis, each showing the
series mapped to that legend.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following chart uses the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix``
database. The ``metacritic`` field rates movies on a scale of 0-100, while
the ``tomatoes.critic`` field uses a scale of 0-10. This chart shows the
total scores for all movies for ten directors, with the ``metacritic``
totals on the left Y axis and the ``tomatoes.critic`` totals on the right.

The chart shows that Woody Allen gets better ratings from the Rotten Tomatoes
reviewers, while Steven Soderbergh does better with the Metacritic reviewers.
