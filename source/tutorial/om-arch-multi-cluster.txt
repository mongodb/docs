This section describes specific considerations for deploying the |application|
and the {+appdb+} on multiple |k8s| clusters, where you set
:opsmgrkube:`spec.topology` and :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.topology`
to ``MultiCluster``.

This section addresses the following areas:

- :ref:`Single- and Multi-Cluster Mode <mode-multi-or-single>`
- :ref:`Limitations <om-multi-k8s-limitations>`
- :ref:`Differences between Single and Multi-cluster Deployments <multi-vs-single-om-diffs>`

.. note::

  For actual deployment steps, see :ref:`deploy-om-multi-cluster`.

.. _mode-multi-or-single:

Single- and Multi-Cluster Mode
-------------------------------

The following settings in the :ref:`k8s-om-specification` define the mode
in which you deploy the |application| and the {+appdb+} custom
resources:

- Multi-cluster mode. To deploy the |application| and the {+appdb+}
  on multiple |k8s| clusters, set :opsmgrkube:`spec.topology` and
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.topology` to ``MultiCluster``.

  If you define :opsmgrkube:`spec.topology` and :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.topology`
  as ``MultiCluster``, this allows you to begin with a single-member |k8s| cluster
  and scale your multi-cluster deployment as needed. In particular:

  - You can create a deployment in a multi-cluster mode that has only one member cluster.
  - You can have the replica set of a minimum 3 |mongod| processes for the
    {+appdb+} deployed on a single member cluster in a multi-cluster
    mode. To increase resilience of the {+appdb+}, you can expand
    the replica set to span across multiple |k8s| clusters and redeploy
    the configuration.

  - You can have a single |application| instance deployed on a single member
    cluster in a multi-cluster mode. To increase resilience of the |application|,
    you can add more |k8s| clusters, add the |application| instances on them
    and redeploy the configuration.

- Single cluster mode. To deploy the |application| and the {+appdb+}
  on a single |k8s| cluster, omit specifying the values for the following
  settings, or set :opsmgrkube:`spec.topology` and
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.topology` to ``SingleCluster``.

.. _om-multi-k8s-limitations:

Limitations
------------

Deploying the |application| and the {+appdb+} on multiple |k8s|
clusters has the following limitations:

- You can't change the topology of an existing |onprem| deployment from
  single to multi-cluster. You can set :opsmgrkube:`spec.topology` and
  :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.topology` to ``MultiCluster``
  only for new deployments of the |application|.

- You can't use the |k8s-op-short| to deploy the |application| and the
  {+appdb+} without a service mesh. To learn more, see
  :ref:`om-service-mesh`.

- You can't use |hashicorp-vault| in any multi-cluster |k8s| deployments.
  This includes multi-cluster deployments of |onprem| resources,
  the {+appdb+} resources, and |mongodb-multis|.

Differences between Single and Multi-Cluster |onprem| Deployments
------------------------------------------------------------------

The following table lists the differences between single and multi-|k8s|
cluster deployments of the |application| and the {+appdb+}.
All other features not listed in this table are equivalent for single and
multi-cluster deployments.

   * - Capability or Requirement
     - Single-Cluster Deployment
     - Multi-Cluster Deployment

   * - You must install the |k8s-op-short| in the same cluster as the |application|
       and the {+appdb+}.
     - Yes
     - No. The operator cluster can also host the |application|, the
       {+appdb+} and the Backup Daemon. To learn more,
       see :ref:`om-multi-k8s-diagram`.

   * - You must configure the |k8s-op-short| for :ref:`single or multi-cluster mode <mode-multi-or-single>`.
     - No.
     - Yes

   * - :ref:`Service mesh is required <om-service-mesh>` for |k8s| clusters
       hosting the |application| and the {+appdb+}.
     - No
     - Yes

   * - Alternative Secret Storage (|hashicorp-vault|) is supported.
     - Yes
     - No. To learn more, see :ref:`om-multi-k8s-limitations`.

   * - All backup mechanisms are supported.
     - Yes
     - No. Only |s3|-compatible Oplog and snapshot storage backups are supported.
       To learn more, see :opsmgrkube:`spec.clusterSpecList[*].backup`.`

   * - |kmip| encryption
     - Yes
     - With :ref:`limitations <kmip-limitations>`.
