Production deployments of MongoDB should have a strategy for
capturing and restoring backups to aid recovery in the case of
power failure, hardware failure, or human error. The best backups
provide flexible restoration options and minimize the impact on the
running system.

MongoDB provides backup methods to support backups
for different kinds of deployments. When developing a backup strategy,
consider the requirements of your deployment and the backup
methods addressed in this document.

Backup Methods

MMS Backup
~~~~~~~~~~

The `MongoDB Management Service
<https://mms.10gen.com/?pk_campaign=MongoDB-Org&pk_kwd=Backup-Docs>`_
supports :mms:`backup and restore for MongoDB deployments </backup>`.

Operation
`````````

Replica Sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^

MMS backups for replica sets uses a lightweight backup agent that runs
within a deployment to copy data to the Backup service. Internally,
MMS Backup operates like a secondary.

The agent first performs a process that resembles the
:ref:`initial sync for new replica set members
<replica-set-initial-sync>`. The agent *always* collects :term:`oplog`
entries and, just like :doc:`replication
</core/replication-introduction>`, applies those operations to the
backup snapshots. MMS Backup uses this oplog to build point-in-time
snapshots of the replica set.

If MMS cannot reach the backup agent, MMS automatically sends an
alert. MMS also alerts if the MMS Backup service falls too far behind
the deployment.

See the :mms:`tutorial for enabling backup with MMS
</backup/tutorial/enable-backup-for-replica-set/>` to begin using MMS
Backup.

Sharded Clusters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each shard in a production sharded cluster is a replica set. MMS
Backup treats each shard like all other replica sets.

To create a backup of a sharded cluster, MMS Backup temporarily
disables all :ref:`balancing operations <sharding-balancing>`
and inserts a synchronization token into the oplog of all shards. MMS
Backup uses these tokens to produce snapshots of the cluster.

MMS Backup produces these cluster wide backups on a regular schedule,
and can restore the sharded cluster to one of these points in time.

See the :mms:`tutorial for enabling backup for sharded clusters with MMS
</backup/tutorial/enable-backup-for-sharded-cluster/>` to begin
backing up a sharded cluster with MMS Backup.

Restoration
^^^^^^^^^^^

MMS Backup provides restorations in the form of MongoDB data
files. MMS can either provide from the remote MMS servers or push a
set of MongoDB data files onto a local directory on a server.

See :mms:`Restore from a Stored Snapshot
</backup/tutorial/restore-from-snapshot/>` and :mms:`Restore a Replica
set from a Point in the Last 24 Hours
</backup/tutorial/restore-from-point-in-time-snapshot/>`.

Benefits
````````

MMS simplifies the set up and configuration of a backup
system. The Backup agent has no dependencies and minimal
configuration. See the :mms:`Backup agent installation
</backup/tutorial/install-and-start-backup-agent/>` and :mms:`Backup
agent configuration </backup/tutorial/configure-backup-agent>`
tutorials for a description of this process.

MMS replicates from secondaries, which minimizes the load on the
primary.

For replica sets, oplog tracking ensures your ability to restore to
any point in time within the past 24 hours. Regular snapshots for
replica sets and sharded clusters ensure your ability to restore to
specific earlier states as well.

Considerations
``````````````

MMS can only back up replica sets and sharded cluster config
servers.

The Backup agent must be able to contact the MMS server.

Filesystem Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operation
``````````

If the volume where MongoDB stores data files supports point in time
snapshots, you can use these snapshots to create backups of a MongoDB
system.

The mechanics of snapshots depend on the underlying volume management
system. Any system that uses a copy-on-write or comparable
strategy is effective for creating backups of MongoDB:
MongoDB supports backups using LVM snapshots on Linux
system and Amazon's EBS snapshots for Amazon EC2 users.

For more information, see the
:doc:`/tutorial/backup-and-restore-with-filesystem-snapshots` and
:doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-filesystem-snapshots` for
complete instructions on using LVM to create snapshots. Also see
:ecosystem:`Back up and Restore Processes for MongoDB on Amazon EC2
</tutorial/backup-and-restore-mongodb-on-amazon-ec2>`.

Benefits
````````

Snapshots capture the state of the database at a specific point in
time. With journaling enabled, if the journal resides on the same
volume as the data files, you can create a snapshot while maintaining
write availability for the :program:`mongod` instance.

For systems like LVM, snapshot creation completes quickly and has
limited impact on system performance while migrating the data off of
the system.

Considerations
``````````````

To take file system snapshots, MongoDB's data files must reside on a
volume manager that supports snapshots. Without journaling, or if the
journal is not on the same volume as the data files, you must stop all
writes while creating the snapshot.

Because snapshots capture the data and indexes, snapshots are not
space efficient backups.

MongoDB Dump and Restore Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operation
`````````

The :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore` tools read data
from a MongoDB database and create high fidelity files with the
data.

:program:`mongodump` creates backups by querying all data in all
collection and writing that data to a file. :program:`mongorestore`
can take the output of :program:`mongodump` and write that data to a
MongoDB deployment.

See :doc:`/tutorial/backup-and-restore-with-binary-database-dumps`,
:doc:`/tutorial/backup-small-sharded-cluster-with-mongodump`,
and :doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps`
for more information.

Benefits
````````

:program:`mongodump` does not capture indexes and stores only the
documents that it backs up. The resulting backup is space efficient.

:program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore` tools have two modes
of operation: client, or *online* mode; and direct file access, or
*offline* mode.

As a client, :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore` connect
to a MongoDB instance over a network to read or write data. With
direct file access, :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore`
read and write directly to the :program:`mongod` data files.

When connected to a running :program:`mongod`, the
:option:`mongodump --oplog` creates a consistent point in time
backup. Use the corresponding :option:`mongorestore --oplogReplay`
options to restore these backups. Applications may continue modifying
data while running :program:`mongodump` with the :option:`--oplog
<mongodump --oplog>` option.

Considerations
``````````````

When connected to a MongoDB instance, :program:`mongodump` and
:program:`mongorestore` use standard query and write operations. These
operations affect the :term:`working set`. The performance of
these operations depend on other operations and activity within the
:program:`mongod` instance.

When using :program:`mongorestore`, the :program:`mongod` must build
indexes in addition to restoring the data.

:program:`mongodump` does not back up the :ref:`local database
<replica-set-local-database>` unless explicitly specified.

:program:`mongodump` cannot create a point-in-time backup of a
standalone :program:`mongod` instance because standalone instances lack
an :term:`oplog`.

Deployment Considerations
-------------------------

All Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To facilitate a robust backup strategy, all MongoDB deployments
should:

- use MMS Backups.

- run all production deployments with journaling enabled. By default,
  MongoDB enables journaling. The journal can facilitate snapshots and
  provides robust durability for :program:`mongod` instances.

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For replica sets, create backups from secondary members to minimize
the impact on the :doc:`primary </core/replica-set-primary>` with
backup operations. Consider using a :doc:`hidden member
</core/replica-set-hidden-member>` as a dedicated backup instance.

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any approach to sharded cluster backups must ensure data consistency
between shards. To create a backup of a sharded cluster you must
:doc:`turn off the balancer
</tutorial/schedule-backup-window-for-sharded-clusters>`.

Additionally, your backup method must synchronize the snapshots of all
shards. MMS uses a synchronization token, but you can accomplish the
same effect by stopping all write operations while capturing backups.

When backing up any sharded cluster, you must also :doc:`back up the
config server metadata </tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-metadata>`.

Testing and Restoring Backups
-----------------------------

A backup system is only useful if it is possible to restore and
recover data using the backup. *Always* test backups to ensure that
restorations are viable, and include recovery testing as part of your
larger backup strategy.

Consider the following restoration tutorials:

- :doc:`/tutorial/restore-replica-set-from-backup`
- :doc:`/tutorial/restore-single-shard`
- :doc:`/tutorial/restore-sharded-cluster`.
