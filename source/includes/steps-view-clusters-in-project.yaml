title: "Review the {+database-deployment+}'s' details."
content: |

  The |service| consoles displays the following for {+database-deployments+} in the
  selected project:

  - Metadata:

    .. include:: /includes/list-tables/per-project-cluster-list.rst

  - High-level :doc:`metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics/>`:

    - Read / write operations per second.

    - Number of open connections to the {+database-deployment+}.

    - Logical size of {+database-deployment+} data.

    - {+Database-deployment+} disk |iops| (*Available on M10+ {+clusters+}*).

  .. note::

     |service| pauses monitoring for these metrics on ``M0``
     {+clusters+} without connection activity for seven days. |service|
     indicates which {+clusters+} fell into this state in the
     :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployment+} Detail` view. |service| limits details
     displayed for these {+clusters+}.

     To resume monitoring, make a successful connection to the {+cluster+}
     using:

     - The {+atlas-admin-api+},
     - A :doc:`Driver </driver-connection>`,
     - {+mongosh+}, or
     - The :doc:`{+atlas-ui+} </atlas-ui>`.
