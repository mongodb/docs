  - ``must`` clause with the :ref:`text-ref` operator to search for the 
    term ``snow`` in the ``title`` field and modify the score using 
    arithmetic expressions.

  - ``should`` clause with the :ref:`text-ref` operator to query 
    for the term ``snow`` in the ``title`` field and alter the 
    ``score`` with the ``function`` option. The ``function`` option 
    adds the following using an arithmetic expression: 
        
    - The relevance score of the query for the search term
    - The value of the numeric field named ``imdb.rating`` or the 
      number ``2`` for those documents that do not have the ``imdb.rating`` 
      field.
