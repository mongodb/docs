Use this procedure to deploy a replica set in a |multi-cluster| without
using a service mesh for establishing external connectivity between member
|k8s| clusters.

As an alternative to using this procedure, you can use the
:ref:`multi-cluster-quick-start-ref`, which uses a service mesh.

Before You Begin
----------------

- Learn about :ref:`multi-Kubernetes-cluster deployments <multi-cluster-overview-ref>`.
- Review the list of :ref:`multi-Kubernetes-cluster services and tools <multi-cluster-services-tools-ref>`.

- Complete the :ref:`prerequisites <multi-cluster-prereqs>`, but don't set up a service mesh.
  Instead, :ref:`decide whether you need a service mesh <mc_plan_external_connectivity>`.
  If you choose to deploy without a service mesh,
  :ref:`use external domains and configure DNS to enable external connectivity <dns-and-external-domain>`.
- As part of completing the prerequisites, generate valid certificates for
  |tls| encryption. To learn more, see :ref:`multi-cluster-tls-prereqs`.
- Deploy the |onprem| resources.
- Install the |k8s-op-short| in a |multi-cluster|. See :ref:`multi-cluster-quick-start-ref`.

Overview
---------

In a |multi-cluster| without a service mesh, use the following
|mongodb-multi| settings:

- Use the :ref:`spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalService <multi-spec-clusterspeclist-externalservice>`
  setting so that the |k8s-op-short| creates an external service, and as part of
  its default configuration, configures a load balancer with default settings.
  Configure the load balancer to serve as the TCP proxy with a |tls| passthrough
  (no TLS termination in the load balancer).

- Customize external services that the |k8s-op-short| creates for each Pod
  in the |k8s| cluster. Use the global "all-clusters" configuration in the
  :ref:`spec.externalAccess <multi-spec-externalaccess>` settings and
  |k8s| cluster-specific overrides in the :ref:`spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalService
  <multi-spec-clusterspeclist-externalservice>` settings.

- Specify cloud provider-specific annotations for the load balancer in
  the :ref:`spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalService.annotations <multi-spec-clusterspeclist-annotations>`
  for each |k8s| cluster.

- Specify an external domain in :ref:`spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalDomain <multi-spec-clusterspeclist-externaldomain>`.
  This allows the |k8s-op-short| to register ``mongod`` processes by using
  the domain suffix. This enables external connections to the ``mongod`` processes
  in a |multi-cluster|.

Deploy a ``MongoDBMultiCluster`` Resource  without a Service Mesh
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The following procedure establishes |tls|-encrypted connections between
MongoDB hosts in a replica set, and between client applications and
MongoDB deployments.
