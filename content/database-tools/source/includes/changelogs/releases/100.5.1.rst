100.5.1 Changelog
-----------------

*Released 2021-10-12*

This release fixes an issue where certain ``config`` collections which
should generally be ignored were included by :binary:`~bin.mongodump`
and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`. This release also ensures that any
operations on these collections will not be applied during the oplog
replay phase of :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`.
