The shard key is either an indexed :term:`field` or indexed
:term:`compound <compound index>` fields that determines the
distribution of the collection's :term:`documents <document>` among the
cluster's :term:`shards <shard>`.

Specifically, MongoDB divides the span of shard key values (or hashed
shard key values) into non-overlapping ranges of shard key values (or
hashed shard key values). Each range is associated with a
:term:`chunk`, and MongoDB attempts to distribute chunks evenly among
the shards in the cluster.

.. include:: /images/sharding-range-based.rst

The shard key has a direct relationship to the effectiveness of chunk
distribution. See :ref:`sharding-shard-key-selection`.

.. _sharding-shard-key-creation:

Shard Key Specification
-----------------------

You must specify the shard key when you shard the collection. You can
use the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
:method:`sh.shardCollection()` to shard a collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection(<namespace>, <key>) // Optional parameters omitted

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - ``namespace``
   
     - Specify the full namespace of the collection (i.e.
       "<database>.<collection>") to shard.

   * - ``key``

     - Specify a document ``{ <shard key field1>: <1|"hashed">, ... }`` where

       - ``1`` indicates :doc:`range-based sharding </core/ranged-sharding>`

       - ``"hashed"`` indicates :doc:`hashed sharding </core/hashed-sharding>`.

.. note:: Shard Key Fields and Values

   Existence
      Starting in version 4.4, documents in sharded collections can be
      missing the shard key fields. A missing shard key falls into the
      same range as a ``null``-valued shard key. See
      :ref:`shard-key-missing`.

      In version 4.2 and earlier, shard key fields must exist in every
      document for a sharded collection.

   Update Field's Value
      .. include:: /includes/limits-sharding-shardkey-document-immutable.rst

      For details on updating the shard key, see :ref:`update-shard-key`.

For more information on the sharding method, see
:method:`sh.shardCollection()`.

.. _shard-key-refine:

Refine a Shard Key
------------------

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can use
:dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` to refine a collection's shard
key. The :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` adds a suffix field
or fields to the existing key to create the new shard key.

For example, you may have an existing ``orders`` collection with the
shard key ``{ customer_id: 1 }``. You can change the shard key by
adding a suffix ``order_id`` field to the shard key so that ``{
customer_id: 1, order_id: 1 }`` becomes the new shard key. For more
information, see the :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command.

Refining a collection's shard key allows for a more fine-grained
data distribution and can address situations where the existing key
has led to :ref:`jumbo (i.e. indivisible) chunks <jumbo-chunks>` due
to insufficient cardinality.

In MongoDB 4.2 and earlier, the choice of shard key cannot be changed
after sharding.

.. _sharding-internals-shard-key-indexes:
.. _sharding-shard-key-indexes:

Shard Key Indexes
-----------------

All sharded collections **must** have an index that supports the
:term:`shard key`; i.e. the index can be an index on the shard key or a
:term:`compound index` where the shard key is a :ref:`prefix
<compound-index-prefix>` of the index.

- If the collection is empty, :method:`sh.shardCollection()` creates
  the index on the shard key if such an index does not already exists.

- If the collection is not empty, you must create the index first
  before using :method:`sh.shardCollection()`.

If you drop the last valid index for the shard key, recover by
recreating an index on just the shard key.

.. _sharding-shard-key-unique:

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB can enforce a uniqueness constraint on a ranged shard key index.
Through the use of a unique index on the shard key, MongoDB enforces
uniqueness on the entire key combination and not individual components
of the shard key.

For a ranged sharded collection, only the following indexes can be
:doc:`unique </core/index-unique>`:

- the index on the shard key

- a :term:`compound index` where the shard key is a :ref:`prefix
  <compound-index-prefix>`

- the default ``_id`` index; **however**, the ``_id`` index only
  enforces the uniqueness constraint per shard **if** the ``_id`` field
  is **not** the shard key or the prefix of the shard key.

  .. important:: Uniqueness and the ``_id`` Index

     If the ``_id`` field is not the shard key or the prefix of the
     shard key, ``_id`` index only enforces the uniqueness constraint
     per shard and **not** across shards.

     For example, consider a sharded collection (with shard key ``{x:
     1}``) that spans two shards A and B. Because the ``_id`` key is
     not part of the shard key, the collection could have a document
     with ``_id`` value ``1`` in shard A and another document with
     ``_id`` value ``1`` in shard B.

     If the ``_id`` field is not the shard key nor the prefix of the
     shard key, MongoDB expects applications to enforce the uniqueness
     of the ``_id`` values across the shards.

The unique index constraints mean that:

- For a to-be-sharded collection, you cannot shard the collection if
  the collection has other unique indexes.

- For an already-sharded collection, you cannot create unique indexes
  on other fields.

- A unique index stores a null value for a document missing the
  indexed field; that is a missing index field is treated as another
  instance of a ``null`` index key value. For more information, see
  :ref:`unique-index-and-missing-field`.

To enforce uniqueness on the shard key values, pass the ``unique``
parameter as ``true`` to the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/shard-collection-unique-restriction-method.rst

You cannot specify a unique constraint on a :ref:`hashed index
<index-type-hashed>`.

Choosing a Shard Key
--------------------

The choice of shard key affects the creation and :ref:`distribution of
the chunks <sharding-balancing>` across the available :term:`shards
<shard>`. This affects the overall efficiency and performance of
operations within the sharded cluster.

The ideal shard key allows MongoDB to distribute documents evenly throughout
the cluster. See also :ref:`sharding strategy <sharding-strategy>`.

At minimum, consider the consequences of the
:ref:`cardinality<shard-key-range>`, :ref:`frequency<shard-key-frequency>`, and
:ref:`monotonicity<shard-key-monotonic>` of a potential shard key.

.. note::

   - Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can use
     :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` to refine a collection's
     shard key. The :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` adds a suffix
     field or fields to the existing key to create the new shard key.
     
   - In MongoDB 4.2 and earlier, once you shard a collection, the
     selection of the shard key is immutable.

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For restrictions on shard key, see :ref:`limits-shard-keys`.

Collection Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When sharding a collection that is not empty, the shard key can
constrain the maximum supported collection size for the initial
sharding operation only. See 
:limit:`Sharding Existing Collection Data Size`.

.. important::

   A sharded collection can grow to any size after successful sharding.

.. _shard-key-range:
.. _sharding-shard-key-cardinality:
.. _shard-key-cardinality:

Shard Key Cardinality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`cardinality` of a shard key determines the maximum number of chunks
the balancer can create. This can reduce or remove the effectiveness of
horizontal scaling in the cluster.

A unique shard key value can exist on no more than a single chunk at any
given time. If a shard key has a cardinality of ``4``, then there can
be no more than ``4`` chunks within the sharded cluster, each storing
one unique shard key value. This constrains the number of effective
shards in the cluster to ``4`` as well - adding additional shards would
not provide any benefit.

The following image illustrates a sharded cluster using the field
``X`` as the shard key. If ``X`` has low cardinality, the distribution of
inserts may look similar to the following:

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-ranged-distribution-low-cardinal.rst

The cluster in this example would *not* scale horizontally, as incoming writes
would only route to a subset of shards.

Choosing a shard key with high cardinality does not, on its own, 
guarantee even distribution of data across the sharded cluster. The 
:ref:`frequency <shard-key-frequency>` and 
:ref:`monotonicity <shard-key-monotonic>` of the shard key also 
contribute to data distribution. Take each factor into account when 
choosing a shard key.

If your data model requires sharding on a key that has low cardinality,
consider using a :term:`compound index` using a field that
has higher relative cardinality.

.. _shard-key-frequency:

Shard Key Frequency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider a set representing the range of shard key values - the ``frequency``
of the shard key represents how often a given value occurs in the data. If the
majority of documents contain only a subset of those values, then the chunks
storing those documents become a bottleneck within the cluster. Furthermore,
as those chunks grow, they may become :ref:`indivisible chunks <jumbo-chunks>`
as they cannot be split any further. This reduces or removes the effectiveness
of horizontal scaling within the cluster.

The following image illustrates a sharded cluster using the field ``X`` as the
shard key. If a subset of values for ``X`` occur with high frequency, the
distribution of inserts may look similar to the following:

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-ranged-distribution-frequency.rst

Choosing a shard key with low frequency does not, on its own, guarantee 
even distribution of data across the sharded cluster. 
The :ref:`cardinality <shard-key-cardinality>` and 
:ref:`monotonicity <shard-key-monotonic>` of the shard key also 
contribute to data distribution. Take each factor into account when 
choosing a shard key.

If your data model requires sharding on a key that has high frequency
values, consider using a :term:`compound index` using a unique or
low frequency value.

.. _shard-key-monotonic:

Shard Key Monotonicity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A shard key on a value that increases or decreases monotonically is more
likely to distribute inserts to a single shard within the cluster.

This occurs because every cluster has a chunk that captures a range with an
upper bound of :doc:`maxKey</reference/bson-types>`. ``maxKey`` always
compares as higher than all other values. Similarly, there is a chunk that
captures a range with a lower bound of :doc:`minKey</reference/bson-types>`.
``minKey`` always compares as lower than all other values.

If the shard key value is always increasing, all new inserts are routed to the
chunk with ``maxKey`` as the upper bound. If the shard key value is always
decreasing, all new inserts are routed to the chunk with ``minKey`` as the
lower bound. The shard containing that chunk becomes the bottleneck for write
operations.

The following image illustrates a sharded cluster using the field ``X``
as the shard key. If the values for ``X`` are monotonically increasing, the
distribution of inserts may look similar to the following:

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-monotonic-distribution.rst

If the shard key value was monotonically decreasing, then all inserts would
route to ``Chunk A`` instead.

Choosing a shard key that does not change monotonically does not, on 
its own, guarantee even distribution of data across the sharded cluster. 
The :ref:`cardinality<shard-key-cardinality>` and
:ref:`frequency<shard-key-frequency>` of the shard key also contribute
to data distribution. Take each factor into account when choosing a 
shard key.

If your data model requires sharding on a key that changes
monotonically, consider using :doc:`/core/hashed-sharding`.

.. _update-shard-key:

Change a Document's Shard Key Value
-----------------------------------

.. note:: When updating the shard key value

   - You :red:`must` run on a :binary:`~bin.mongos`. Do :red:`not`
     issue the operation directly on the shard.

   - You :red:`must` run either in a :doc:`transaction
     </core/transactions>` or as a :doc:`retryable write
     </core/retryable-writes>`.

   - You :red:`must` include an equality condition on the full shard
     key in the query filter. For example, if a collection messages
     uses ``{ activityid: 1, userid : 1 }`` as the shard key, to update
     the shard key for a document, you must include ``activityid: <value>,
     userid: <value>`` in the query filter. You can include additional
     fields in the query as appropriate.

   See also the specific write command/methods for additional
   operation-specific requirements when run against a sharded
   collection.

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, you can update a document's shard key value
unless the shard key field is the immutable ``_id`` field. To update,
use the following operations to update a document's shard key value:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Command
     - Method

   * - :ref:`update <command-update-shard-key-modification>` with ``multi: false``
     - | :ref:`db.collection.replaceOne() <replaceOne-shard-key-modification>`
       | :ref:`db.collection.updateOne() <updateOne-shard-key-modification>`
       | :ref:`db.collection.update() <method-update-shard-key-modification>` with ``multi: false``

   * - :ref:`findAndModify <cmd-findAndModify-sharded-collection>`
     - | :ref:`db.collection.findOneAndReplace() <findOneAndReplace-shard-key-modification>`
       | :ref:`db.collection.findOneAndUpdate() <findOneAndUpdate-shard-key-modification>`
       | :ref:`db.collection.findAndModify() <method-findAndModify-sharded-collection>`

   * -
     - | :method:`db.collection.bulkWrite()`
       | :method:`Bulk.find.updateOne()`

       If the shard key modification results in moving the document to
       another shard, you cannot specify more than one shard key
       modification in the bulk operation; i.e. batch size of
       1.

       If the shard key modification does not result in moving the
       document to another shard, you can specify multiple shard
       key modification in the bulk operation.

.. include:: /includes/shard-key-modification-warning.rst

.. _shard-key-missing:

Missing Shard Key
-----------------

Starting in version 4.4, documents in sharded collections can be
missing the shard key fields.

Chunk Range and Missing Shard Key Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Missing shard keys fall within the same chunk range as shard keys with
null values. For example, if the shard key is on the fields ``{ x: 1, y: 1
}``, then:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 60 60 

   * - Document Missing Shard Key

     - Falls into Same Range As

   * - ``{ x: "hello" }``
     - ``{ x: "hello", y: null }``

   * - ``{ y: "goodbye" }``
     - ``{ x: null, y: "goodbye" }``

   * - ``{ z: "oops" }``
     - ``{ x: null, y: null }``

.. _shard-key-missing-read-write-ops:

Read/Write Operations and Missing Shard Key Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To target documents with missing shard key fields, you can use the
:query:`{ $exists: false } <$exists>` filter condition on the shard key
fields. For example, if the shard key is on the fields ``{ x: 1, y: 1
}``, to find the documents with missing shard key fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.shardedcollection.find( { $or: [ { x: { $exists: false } }, { y: { $exists: false } } ] } )

If you specify an :doc:`null equality match
</tutorial/query-for-null-fields>` filter condition (e.g. ``{ x: null
}``), the filter matches :red:`both` those documents with missing shard
key fields :red:`and` those with shard key fields set to ``null``.

Some write operations, such as a write with an ``upsert``
specification, require an equality match on the shard key. In those
cases, to target a document that is missing the shard key, include
another filter condition in addition to the ``null`` equality match.
For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: <value>, <shardkeyfield>: null } // _id of the document missing shard key

.. _shard-key-missing-set:

Set the Missing Shard Key Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set missing shard key fields (which is different from :ref:`changing
the value of an existing shard key field <update-shard-key>`), you can
use the following operations on a :binary:`~bin.mongos`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Command
     - Method
     - Description

   * - | :ref:`update <command-update-shard-key-modification>` with
       | ``multi: true``

     - | :ref:`db.collection.update() <method-update-shard-key-modification>` with
       | ``multi: true``

     - - Can be used to set the missing key value to ``null`` only.
     
       - Can be performed inside or outside a transaction.

       - Can be performed as a retryable write or not.

       - For additional requirements, refer to the specific
         command/method.

     - | :ref:`db.collection.replaceOne() <replaceOne-missing-shard-key>`
       | :ref:`db.collection.updateOne() <updateOne-missing-shard-key>`
       | :ref:`db.collection.update() <method-update-shard-key-modification>` with 
       | ``multi: false``

     - - Can be used to set the missing key value to ``null`` or any
         other value.

       - To set to a non-``null`` value, :red:`must` be performed either

       | :ref:`db.collection.findOneAndUpdate() <findOneAndUpdate-missing-shard-key>`
       | :ref:`db.collection.findAndModify() <method-findAndModify-missing-shard-key>`

     - - Can be used to set the missing key value to ``null`` or any
         other value.

       - To set to a non-``null`` value, :red:`must` be performed either

       - :red:`Must` include in the query filter an equality condition
         on the shard key. Since a missing key value is returned as part
         of a ``null`` equality match, to avoid updating a null-valued

         appropriate.

       - For additional requirements, refer to the specific
         command/method.

       | :method:`Bulk.find.replaceOne()`
       | :method:`Bulk.find.updateOne()`
       | :method:`Bulk.find.update()`

     - - To set to a ``null`` value,  you can specify multiple shard
         key modifications in the bulk operation.

       - To set to a non-``null`` value, you can specify a single shard
         key modification in the bulk operation; i.e. batch size of 1.

       - To set to a non-``null`` value, :red:`must` be performed either
         inside a transaction or as a retryable write.
