Overview
--------

In this section, you can identify essential changes you must make to your
application when you upgrade your provider to a new version.

Before you upgrade, perform the following actions:

- Ensure the new version is compatible with the {+mdb-server+} version
  your application connects to and the {+language-dotnet+} version your
  application runs on. See the :ref:`Compatibility <entity-framework-compatibility>`
  section for this information.
- Address any breaking changes between the current version of the provider
  your application is using and your planned upgrade version in the
  :ref:`Breaking Changes <entity-framework-breaking-changes>` section.

Breaking Changes
----------------

A breaking change is a modification of a convention or a behavior starting in
a specific version of the provider. This type of change might prevent your application from
working properly if not addressed before upgrading the provider.

The breaking changes in this section are categorized by the provider version that
introduced them. When upgrading provider versions, address all the breaking
changes between the current and upgrade versions. For example, if you
are upgrading the provider from v8.0 to v8.5, address all breaking changes from
the version after v8.0, including any listed under v8.5.

Version 9.0.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 9.0.0 of the {+provider-short+} includes the same breaking changes as
version 8.3.0 of the {+provider-short+}.

For more information about the breaking changes in version 9.0.0 and how to
address them, see the :ref:`entity-framework-breaking-changes-v8.3` section.

.. _entity-framework-breaking-changes-v8.3:

Version 8.30.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 8.3.0 of the {+provider-short+} introduces a breaking change that
corrects the handling of nullable properties configured with an alternative BSON
representation. In previous versions, configurations set by the
``[BsonRepresentation]`` attribute or the ``HasBsonRepresentation()`` fluent API
were not applied. 

You can take action to address this discrepency in one of two ways:

- If using the alternative BSON representation is not critical, remove the
  configuration from your application before it starts.

- Alternatively, you can update the affected elments to the new representation.
  As part of your upgrade process, use the ``updateMany`` method for each
  affected MongoDB collection to rewrite any affected nullable properties or
  elements into the desired BSON representation using the ``$convert``
  operation.

  For example, you can convert a ``dateOfBirth`` element in a collection named
  ``people`` from a BSON ``date`` into BSON ``int`` as shown in the following
  code:

  .. code-block:: csharp

      db.people.updateMany(
        { dateOfBirth: {$type: "date" } },
        [
          { $set: { 
              dateOfBirth: 
                { $convert: 
                  { input: "$dateOfBirth", 
                    to: "int", 
                    onNull: null 
                  } 
                } 
            } 
          }
        ]
      )

.. _entity-framework-breaking-changes-v8.2:

Version 8.2.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 8.2.0 of the {+provider-short+} does not directly introduce any breaking
changes. However, the underlying {+csharp-driver-short+} introduces many
potentially breaking changes in the v3.0 release, which might affect your
application. To learn more about the breaking changes in v3.0 of the
{+csharp-driver-short+}, see the `Upgrade to Version 3.0 guide
<{+driver-docs-root+}/upgrade/v3/>`__ 
in the {+csharp-driver-short+} documentation.


.. _entity-framework-breaking-changes-v8.1:

Version 8.1.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated the {+provider-short+} to run all changes as MongoDB transactions. If your
  application uses {+mdb-server+} earlier than v5.0, or does not run in a
  replica set, you must make the following changes to your application:

  - If your application is configured for a {+mdb-server+} version earlier than v5.0, you
    must upgrade to {+mdb-server+} v5.0 or later.
  - If your application runs on a standalone server, you must reconfigure your
    standalone server to a single-instance replica set. To learn more about how
    to reconfigure your standalone server, see
    :manual:`Convert a Standalone Self-Managed mongod to a Replica Set </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set>` in the
    {+mdb-server+} manual.
  - If your application runs in a container environment, switch to a
    single-instance replica set container if one is available.

  To avoid snapshot issues during transactions, call the ``EnsureCreated()`` or
  ``EnsureCreatedAsync()`` method during your application start-up, rather than
  creating the collection or database
  implicitly.

  .. note::

     Calling the ``EnsureCreated()`` or ``EnsureCreatedAsync()`` method throws
     an error if your application is running on a
     :atlas:`shared cluster </reference/free-shared-limitations/>`.
     Applications running on free and shared clusters should not call these
     methods. 

  If you don't want to ensure :wikipedia:`optimistic concurrency
  <Optimistic_concurrency_control>` with transactions, you can
  disable automatic transactions by setting ``Database.AutoTransactionBehavior =
  AutoTrasactionBehavior.Never`` on your ``DbContext`` subclass during your
  application setup.

- Changed the default GUID storage format from ``CSharpLegacy`` binary format
  to ``Standard`` format. If your database contains existing GUIDs that are not
  in ``Standard`` format, we recommend converting them to ``Standard`` format.

- The ``CamelCaseElementNameConvention`` converts the casing of owned entities
  based on their property name instead of their class name. If your application
  uses the ``CamelCaseElementNameConvention``, the casing of your data might change.

For more information about the breaking changes in this version, see the
:github:`Breaking Changes
<mongodb/mongo-efcore-provider/blob/main/BREAKING-CHANGES.md>` section
of the provider repository on GitHub.
