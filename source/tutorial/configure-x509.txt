Authenticate with x.509 Certificate
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 2.6

MongoDB supports x.509 certificate authentication for use with a secure
:doc:`SSL connection </tutorial/configure-ssl>`. The x.509
authentication allows :ref:`clients to authenticate to servers with
certificates <x509-client-authentication>` instead of with username and
password. The x.509 authentication also allows sharded cluster members
and replica set members to use x.509 certificates to :ref:`verify their
membership to the cluster or the replica set
<x509-internal-authentication>` instead of using :doc:`keyfiles
</core/authentication>`. The membership authentication is
an internal process.

.. _x509-client-authentication:

Use x.509 for Client Authentication
-----------------------------------

Client x.509 Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The client certificate must have the following
properties:

- A single Certificate Authority (CA) must issue the certificates
  for both the client and the server.

- Client certificates must contain the following fields:

  .. code-block:: none

     keyUsage = digitalSignature
     extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth

Configure MongoDB Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure the MongoDB server from the command line, as in the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslMode requireSSL --sslPEMKeyFile <path to SSL certificate and key PEM file> --sslCAFile <path to root CA PEM file>

You may also specify these options in the :doc:`configuration file
</reference/configuration-options>`:

.. code-block:: none

   sslMode = requireSSL
   sslPEMKeyFile = <path to SSL certificate and key PEM file>
   sslCAFile = <path to the root CA PEM file>

Include any additional options, SSL or otherwise, that are required for
your specific configuration.

.. _addX509SubjectUser:

Add x.509 Certificate ``subject`` as a User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To authenticate with a client certificate, you must first add the value
of the ``subject`` from the client certificate as a MongoDB user.

#. You can retrieve the ``subject`` from the client certificate with
   the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      openssl x509 -in <pathToClient PEM> -inform PEM -subject -nameopt RFC2253

   The command returns the ``subject`` string as well as certificate:

   .. code-block:: sh

      subject= CN=myName,OU=myOrgUnit,O=myOrg,L=myLocality,ST=myState,C=myCountry
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      # ...
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----

#. Add the value of the ``subject``, omitting the spaces, from the
   certificate as a user.

   For example, in the :program:`mongo` shell, to add the user with
   both the ``readWrite`` role in the ``test`` database and the
   ``userAdminAnyDatabase`` role which is defined only in the ``admin``
   database:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("$external").runCommand(
        {
          createUser: "CN=myName,OU=myOrgUnit,O=myOrg,L=myLocality,ST=myState,C=myCountry",
          roles: [
                   { role: 'readWrite', db: 'test' },
                   { role: 'userAdminAnyDatabase', db: 'admin' }
                 ],
          writeConcern: { w: "majority" , wtimeout: 5000 }
        }
      )

   In the above example, to add the user with the ``readWrite`` role in
   the ``test`` database, the role specification document specified
   ``'test'`` in the ``db`` field. To add ``userAdminAnyDatabase``
   role for the user, the above example specified ``'admin'`` in the
   ``db`` field.

   .. note::
      Some roles are defined only in the ``admin`` database, including:
      ``clusterAdmin``, ``readAnyDatabase``, ``readWriteAnyDatabase``,
      ``dbAdminAnyDatabase``, and ``userAdminAnyDatabase``. To add a
      user with these roles, specify ``'admin'`` in the ``db``.

See :doc:`/tutorial/add-user-to-database` for details on adding a user
with roles.

Authenticate with a x.509 Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To authenticate with a client certificate, you must first add a MongoDB
user that corresponds to the client certificate. See
:ref:`addX509SubjectUser`.

To authenticate, use the :method:`db.auth()` method in the
``$external`` database, specifying ``"MONGODB-X509"`` for the
``mechanism`` field, and the :ref:`user that corresponds to the client
certificate <addX509SubjectUser>` for the ``user`` field.

For example, if using the :program:`mongo` shell,

1. Connect :program:`mongo` shell to the :program:`mongod` set up for
   SSL:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo --ssl --sslPEMKeyFile <path to CA signed client PEM file>

#. To perform the authentication, use the :method:`db.auth()` method in
   the ``$external`` database. For the ``mechanism`` field, specify
   ``"MONGODB-X509"``, and for the ``user`` field, specify the user, or
   the ``subject``, that corresponds to the client certificate.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("$external").auth(
        {
          mechanism: "MONGODB-X509",
          user: "CN=myName,OU=myOrgUnit,O=myOrg,L=myLocality,ST=myState,C=myCountry"
        }
      )

.. _x509-internal-authentication:

Use x.509 for Replica Set/Sharded Cluster Member Authentication
---------------------------------------------------------------

Member x.509 Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The member certificate, used for internal authentication to verify
membership to the sharded cluster or a replica set, must have the
following properties:

- A single Certificate Authority (CA) must issue all the x.509
  certificates for the members of a sharded cluster or a replica set.

- The member certificate's ``subject``, which contains the
  Distinguished Name (``DN``), must match the ``subject`` of the
  certificate on the other servers in the cluster, *starting from and
  including* the Organizational Unit (``OU``) of the certificate on the
  server.

- Either the Common Name (``CN``) or one of the Subject Alternative
  Name (``SAN``) entries must match the hostname of the server, used by
  the other members of the cluster.

For example, the certificates for a cluster could have the following
subjects:

.. code-block:: sh

   subject= CN=<myhostname1>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
   subject= CN=<myhostname2>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US
   subject= CN=<myhostname3>,OU=Dept1,O=MongoDB,ST=NY,C=US

Configure Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify the x.509 certificate for internal cluster member
authentication, append the additional SSL options
:option:`--clusterAuthMode` and :option:`--sslClusterFile`, as in the
following example for a member of a replica set:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --replSet <name> --sslMode requireSSL --clusterAuthMode x509 --sslClusterFile <path to membership certificate and key PEM file> --sslPEMKeyFile <path to SSL certificate and key PEM file> --sslCAFile <path to root CA PEM file>

Include any additional options, SSL or otherwise, that are required for
your specific configuration. For instance, if the membership key is
encrypted, set the :option:`--sslClusterPassword` to the passphrase to
decrypt the key or have MongoDB prompt for the passphrase. See
:ref:`ssl-certificate-password` for details.

.. note:: 
   You may also specify these options in the :doc:`configuration file
   </reference/configuration-options>`, as in the following example:

   .. code-block:: ini

      sslMode = requireSSL
      sslPEMKeyFile = <path to SSL certificate and key PEM file>
      sslCAFile = <path to root CA PEM file>
      clusterAuthMode = x509 
      sslClusterFile = <path to membership certificate and key PEM file>

.. _upgrade-to-x509-internal-authentication:

Upgrade from Keyfile Authentication to to x.509 Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade clusters that are currently using keyfile authentication to
x.509 authentication, use a rolling upgrade process.

Clusters Currently Using SSL
````````````````````````````

For clusters using SSL and keyfile authentication, to upgrade to x.509
cluster authentication, use the following rolling upgrade process:

#. For each node of a cluster, start the node with the option
   :option:`--clusterAuthMode` set to ``sendKeyFile`` and the option
   :option:`--sslClusterFile` set to the appropriate path of the node's
   certificate. Include other :doc:`SSL options
   </tutorial/configure-ssl>` as well as any other options that are
   required for your specific configuration. For example:
  
   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --replSet <name> --sslMode requireSSL --clusterAuthMode sendKeyFile --sslClusterFile <path to membership certificate and key PEM file> --sslPEMKeyFile <path to SSL Certificate and key PEM file>  --sslCAFile <path to root CA PEM file>
      
   With this setting, each node continues to use its keyfile to
   authenticate itself as a member. However, each node can now accept
   either a keyfile or an x.509 certificate from other members to
   authenticate those members. Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to
   this setting.

#. Then, for each node of a cluster, connect to the node and use the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to update the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode`
   to ``sendX509``. [#update-mode-alternative]_ For example,

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.getSiblingDB('admin').runCommand( { setParameter: 1, clusterAuthMode: "sendX509" } )

   With this setting, each node uses its x.509 certificate, specified
   with the :option:`--sslClusterFile` option in the previous step, to
   authenticate itself as a member. However, each node continues to
   accept either a keyfile or an x.509 certificate from other members
   to authenticate those members. Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to
   this setting.

#. Optional but recommended. Finally, for each node of the cluster,
   connect to the node and use the :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to
   update the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` to ``x509`` to only use the
   x.509 certificate for authentication. [#update-mode-alternative]_
   For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.getSiblingDB('admin').runCommand( { setParameter: 1, clusterAuthMode: "x509" } )

#. After the upgrade of all nodes, edit the :doc:`configuration file
   </reference/configuration-options>` with the appropriate x.509
   settings to ensure that upon subsequent restarts, the cluster uses
   x.509 authentication.

See :option:`--clusterAuthMode` for the various modes and their
descriptions.

Clusters Currently Not Using SSL
````````````````````````````````

For clusters using keyfile authentication but not SSL, to upgrade to
x.509 authentication, use the following rolling upgrade process:

#. For each node of a cluster, start the node with the option
   :option:`--sslMode` set to ``allowSSL``, the option
   :option:`--clusterAuthMode` set to ``sendKeyFile`` and the option
   :option:`--sslClusterFile` set to the appropriate path of the node's
   certificate. Include other :doc:`SSL options
   </tutorial/configure-ssl>` as well as any other options that are
   required for your specific configuration. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --replSet <name> --sslMode allowSSL --clusterAuthMode sendKeyFile --sslClusterFile <path to membership certificate and key PEM file> --sslPEMKeyFile <path to SSL certificate and key PEM file>  --sslCAFile <path to root CA PEM file>
      
   The :option:`--sslMode allowSSL <--sslMode>` setting allows the
   node to accept both SSL and non-SSL incoming connections. Its
   outgoing connections do not use SSL.
   
   The :option:`--clusterAuthMode sendKeyFile <--clusterAuthMode>`
   setting allows each node continues to use its keyfile to
   authenticate itself as a member. However, each node can now accept
   either a keyfile or an x.509 certificate from other members to
   authenticate those members.

   Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to these settings.

#. Then, for each node of a cluster, connect to the node and use the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to update the :parameter:`sslMode`
   to ``preferSSL`` and the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` to
   ``sendX509``. [#update-mode-alternative]_ For example:
   
   .. code-block:: sh

      db.getSiblingDB('admin').runCommand( { setParameter: 1, sslMode: "preferSSL", clusterAuthMode: "sendX509" } )

   With the :parameter:`sslMode` set to ``preferSSL``, the node accepts
   both SSL and non-SSL incoming connections, and its outgoing
   connections use SSL.

   With the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` set to ``sendX509``, each node
   uses its x.509 certificate, specified with the
   :option:`--sslClusterFile` option in the previous step, to
   authenticate itself as a member. However, each node continues to
   accept either a keyfile or an x.509 certificate from other members
   to authenticate those members.

   Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to these settings.

#. Optional but recommended. Finally, for each node of the cluster,
   connect to the node and use the :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to
   update the :parameter:`sslMode` to ``requireSSL`` and the
   :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` to ``x509``. [#update-mode-alternative]_
   For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.getSiblingDB('admin').runCommand( { setParameter: 1, sslMode: "requireSSL", clusterAuthMode: "x509" } )

   With the :parameter:`sslMode` set to ``requireSSL``, the node only uses
   SSL connections.
    
   With the :parameter:`clusterAuthMode` set to ``x509``, the node only
   uses the x.509 certificate for authentication.

#. After the upgrade of all nodes, edit the :doc:`configuration file
   </reference/configuration-options>` with the appropriate SSL and
   x.509 settings to ensure that upon subsequent restarts, the cluster
   uses x.509 authentication.

See :option:`--clusterAuthMode` for the various modes and their
descriptions.

.. [#update-mode-alternative] As an alternative to using the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command, you can also
   restart the nodes with the appropriate SSL and x509 options and
   values.
