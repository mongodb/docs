Introduction
------------

Atlas Hosting allows you to host, manage, and serve your application's
static media and document files. You can use Hosting to store individual
pieces of content or to upload and serve your entire client application.

To get started, :doc:`enable hosting </hosting/enable-hosting>` for your
application then start :doc:`uploading content
</hosting/upload-content-to-app-services>`.

Concepts
--------

Static Content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A file is *static* if you can serve it directly to clients without
requiring additional processing or logic to generate it. Static content
includes document files, such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as
media files like images, audio, and videos.

.. _default-hosting-domain:

Hosting Domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services hosts your application's content behind a unique domain
name. By default, App Services uses domains of the following form:

.. code-block:: none

   <Your App ID>.mongodbstitch.com

.. note::

   You can configure App Services to host content at a :doc:`custom domain
   name </hosting/use-a-custom-domain-name>` that you own in addition to
   the default hosting domain.

.. _hosting-resource-path:

Resource Paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A resource path is a string that uniquely identifies an uploaded file
based on its position in the file tree. You can access a hosted file
through a unique URL that consists of your application's hosting domain
followed by the file's resource path.

For example, a PNG image of a company's logo hosted in a directory named
``images`` would have the resource path ``/images/logo.png``. You could
access this image at a URL similar to the following:

.. code-block:: none

   myapp-abcde.mongodbrealm.com/images/logo.png

Constraints
-----------

App Services enforces constraints on static hosting across several dimensions
for each app. The following constraints apply to all
static content hosted by App Services:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Dimension
     - Constraint
   * - **Maximum File Size**
     - 25 megabytes
   * - **Maximum Total Storage**
     - 1 gigabyte
   * - **Maximum Total Files**
     - 20,000 files
   * - **Maximum CDN Flushes**
     - 25 flushes per hour
   * - **Maximum Bandwidth**
     - 100 gigabytes
