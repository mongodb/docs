.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. method:: db.upgradeCheck(<document>)

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   Performs a preliminary check for upgrade preparedness to 2.6. The
   helper, available in the 2.6 :program:`mongo` shell, can run
   connected to either a 2.4 or a 2.6 server.

   The method checks for:

   - documents with index keys :ref:`longer than the index key limit
     <2.6-index-key-length-incompatibility>`,

   - documents with :limit:`illegal field names
     <Restrictions on Field Names>`,

   - collections without an ``_id`` index, and

   - indexes with invalid specifications, such as an index key with an
     empty or illegal field name.

   The method can accept a document parameter which determine the scope
   of the check:

   .. include:: /reference/method/db.upgradeCheck-param.rst

   The optional scope document has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         collection: <string>
      }

   Additional 2.6 changes that affect compatibility with older versions
   require manual checks and intervention. See
   :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-compatibility` for details.

Behavior
--------

.. |method| replace:: :method:`db.upgradeCheck()`

Required Access
---------------

On systems running with :setting:`~security.authentication`, a user must have access that
includes the :authaction:`find` action on all collections, including
the :doc:`system collections </reference/system-collections>`.

Example
-------

The following example connects to a secondary running on ``localhost``
and runs :method:`db.upgradeCheck()` against the ``employees``
collection in the ``records`` database. Because the output from the
method can be quite large, the example pipes the output to a file.

.. code-block:: sh

   ./mongo --eval "db.getMongo().setSlaveOk(); db.upgradeCheck( { collection: 'employees' } )"  localhost/records | tee /tmp/upgradecheck.txt

.. include:: /includes/output-upgrade-check.rst
