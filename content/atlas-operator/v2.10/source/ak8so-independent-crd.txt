You can use |ak8so| to manage resources in an |service| project
without using |ak8so| to manage the project itself. In this
independent custom resource definition ("independent CRD") model, you
associate resources such as :ref:`atlasdeployment-custom-resource` and
:ref:`atlasdatabaseuser-custom-resource` with an |service| project
directly by its |service| :atlas:`ID </api/atlas-admin-api-ref/#project-id>`.

Independent CRDs allow you to use different programmatic
infrastructure management systems for your projects, while you use
|ak8so| to manage more frequently-altered resources such as database
users or individual deployments.

By separating the management of the |service| project from the
management of subresources such as users and deployments, independent
CRDs allow you to allocate these responsibilities to different
personnel or different teams within your organization as suits your
needs.

.. _ak8so-independent-crd-considerations:

Considerations
--------------

When you use |ak8so| to manage a project, you can either configure
{+atlas-admin-api+} authentication using the
``spec.connectionSecretRef.name`` parameter of the ``atlasProject``
resource, or leave this parameter unset to default to global |service|
:ref:`credentials <ak8so-secrets>`. When using independent CRDs, you
can specify a ``spec.connectionSecret.name`` for each resource. This
parameter, if set, takes precedence over
``spec.connectionSecretRef.name`` or global |service|
credentials.

Setting this parameter is required for any resource whose parent
resource is referenced using an |service| :atlas:`project ID
</api/atlas-admin-api-ref/#project-id>`, and optional otherwise.

.. example::

   You define an ``atlasDeployment`` CRD that references its parent
   project by |service| ID instead of an ``atlasProject``
   ``spec.name`` parameter.  You must define a
   ``spec.connectSecret.name`` for the ``atlasDeployment``
   resource, as in the following:

   .. code-block::

      apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
      kind: AtlasDeployment
      metadata:
	name: test-cluster-name
	namespace: mongodb-atlas-system
      spec:
	externalProjectRef:
	  id: 671998971c8520583f24f411
	connectionSecret:
	  name: my-atlas-key
	deploymentSpec:
	  clusterType: REPLICASET
	  name: service-name
	  tags: 
	  - key: "environment"
	    value: "production"
	  backupEnabled: true
	  replicationSpecs:
	    - zoneName: US-Zone
	      numShards: 3
	      regionConfigs:
		- regionName: CENTRAL_US
		  providerName: GCP
		  backingProviderName: GCP
		  priority: 7
		  electableSpecs:
		    instanceSize: M10
		    nodeCount: 3       

.. _ak8so-independent-crd-migrate:

Migration to Independent CRD
----------------------------

To migrate existing CRDs from ``atlasProject``-level management to
independent management:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Disable project reconciliation and edit subresource
      references

      1. Add the ``mongodb.com/atlas-reconciliation-policy: "skip"``
         annotation to the parent resource's ``metadata``. This
         prevents |ak8so| from attempting to reconcile the parent
         resource and its subresources. Consider the following:

	 .. code-block::
	    :emphasize-lines: 5-6

	    apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
	    kind: AtlasProject
	    metadata:
	     name: my-project
	     annotations: 
	       mongodb.com/atlas-reconciliation-policy: "skip"
	    spec:
	     name: Test project
	     connectionSecretRef:
	       name: my-atlas-key
	     projectIpAccessList:
	       - cidrBlock: "203.0.113.0/24"
		 comment: "CIDR block for Application Server B - D"     

         .. warning::

            If you do not apply this annotation, |ak8so| will continue
	    to attempt reconciliation as you modify your other
	    resources. For users with :ref:`<deletion-protection>`
	    disabled, this can result in |ak8so| removing the
	    |service| project when you remove the ``atlasProject``
	    resource, or entering a blocked state attempting to remove
	    a project with active subresources such as database users
	    or deployments.

      #. Modify the project reference to point to an |service|
         :atlas:`project ID </api/atlas-admin-api-ref/#project-id>` instead of an
         ``atlasProject`` name.

	 For example, to decouple an ``atlasDatabaseUser`` resource:

	 .. code-block::
	    :emphasize-lines: 9-10

	    apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
	    kind: AtlasDatabaseUser
	    metadata:
	     name: my-database-user
	    spec:
	     roles:
	       - roleName: readWriteAnyDatabase
		 databaseName: admin
	     externalProjectRef:
	       id: 671998971c8520583f24f411
	     username: theuser
	     passwordSecretRef:
	       name: the-user-password       

   .. step:: Wait for |ak8so| to sync the new resource status.

   .. step:: (Conditional) Remove the ``atlasProject`` CRD.

      To stop managing your project with |ak8so|, you can now remove
      the ``atlasProject`` CRD. To continue managing your project and
      attached subresources with |ak8so|, skip to the next step.
      
   .. step:: (Conditional) Remove the reconciliation policy annotation

      If you want to continue managing your project with |ak8so|, as in
      a scenario where you still have resources subordinate to your
      ``atlasProject``, reactivate reconciliation by removing the
      reconciliation policy annotation from the ``atlasProject`` CRD.
