This document addresses common questions regarding MongoDB's storage
system.

Storage Engine Fundamentals
---------------------------

What is a storage engine?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A storage engine is the part of a database that is responsible for
managing how data is stored, both in memory and on disk. Many databases
support multiple storage engines, where different engines perform better
for specific workloads. For example, one storage engine might offer
better performance for read-heavy workloads, and another might support a
higher throughput for write operations.

   :doc:`/core/storage-engines`

Can you mix storage engines in a replica set?
---------------------------------------------

Yes. You can have replica set members that use different storage
engines (WiredTiger and in-memory)

WiredTiger Storage Engine
-------------------------

Can I upgrade an existing deployment to WiredTiger?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. See:

- :doc:`/tutorial/change-standalone-wiredtiger`

- :doc:`/tutorial/change-replica-set-wiredtiger`

- :doc:`/tutorial/change-sharded-cluster-wiredtiger`

How much compression does WiredTiger provide?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ratio of compressed data to uncompressed data depends on your data
and the compression library used. By default, collection data in
WiredTiger use :term:`Snappy block compression <snappy>`; :term:`zlib`
and :term:`zstd` compression is also available. Index data use
:term:`prefix compression` by default.

.. _faq-wt-reclaim-disk-space:

How do I reclaim disk space in WiredTiger?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The WiredTiger storage engine maintains lists of empty records in data
files as it deletes documents. This space can be reused by WiredTiger,
but will not be returned to the operating system unless under very
specific circumstances.

The amount of empty space available for reuse by WiredTiger is reflected
in the output of :method:`db.collection.stats()` under the heading
``wiredTiger.block-manager.file bytes available for reuse``.

To allow the WiredTiger storage engine to release this empty space to the
operating system, you can de-fragment your data file. This can be achieved
using the :dbcommand:`compact` command. For more information on its behavior
and other considerations, see :dbcommand:`compact`.


Data Storage Diagnostics
------------------------

How can I check the size of a collection?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the statistics for a collection, including the data size, use
the :method:`db.collection.stats()` method from the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell. The following example issues :method:`db.collection.stats()` for
the ``orders`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.stats();

MongoDB also provides the following methods to return specific sizes
for the collection:

- :method:`db.collection.dataSize()` to return the uncompressed data
  size in bytes for the collection.

- :method:`db.collection.storageSize()` to return the size in bytes of
  the collection on disk storage. If collection data is compressed
  (which is the :option:`default for WiredTiger <mongod
  --wiredTigerCollectionBlockCompressor>`), the storage size reflects
  the compressed size and may be smaller than the value returned by
  :method:`db.collection.dataSize()`.

- :method:`db.collection.totalIndexSize()` to return the index sizes in
  bytes for the collection. If an index uses prefix compression
  (which is the :option:`default for WiredTiger <mongod
  --wiredTigerIndexPrefixCompression>`), the returned size reflects the
  compressed size.

The following script prints the statistics for each database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand("listDatabases").databases.forEach(function (d) {
      mdb = db.getSiblingDB(d.name);
      printjson(mdb.stats());
   })

The following script prints the statistics for each collection in each
database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand("listDatabases").databases.forEach(function (d) {
      mdb = db.getSiblingDB(d.name);
      mdb.getCollectionNames().forEach(function(c) { 
         s = mdb[c].stats();
         printjson(s);
      })
   })

How can I check the size of the individual indexes for a collection?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the size of the data allocated for each index, use the
:method:`db.collection.stats()` method and check the
:data:`~collStats.indexSizes` field in the returned document.

If an index uses prefix compression (which is the :option:`default for
WiredTiger <mongod --wiredTigerIndexPrefixCompression>`), the returned
size for that index reflects the compressed size.

.. _faq-tools-for-measuring-storage-use:

How can I get information on the storage use of a database?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :method:`db.stats()` method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell returns
the current state of the "active" database. For the description of the
returned fields, see :ref:`dbStats Output <dbstats-output>`.
