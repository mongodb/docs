Indexes are special data structures that improve query performance.
Indexes store a portion of a collection's data in an easy-to-traverse
form. The index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields,
ordered by the value of the field.

To improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often 
in queries and for all operations that 
:ref:`sort by a field <compass-query-bar-sort>`.

- Queries on an indexed field can use the index to limit the number of 
  documents that must be scanned to find matching documents.

- Sort operations on an indexed field can return documents pre-sorted 
  by the index.

To learn more about indexes, see :manual:`Indexes </indexes>`.

.. note:: Considerations

   Indexes have some negative performance impact on write operations. 
   For collections with high write-to-read ratio, indexes are expensive 
   since each insert must also update any indexes. For a detailed list 
   of considerations for indexes, see
   :ref:`Operational Considerations for Indexes <data-model-indexes>`.

Indexes Tab
-----------

The :guilabel:`Indexes` tab lists the existing indexes for a collection.

To access the :guilabel:`Indexes` tab for a collection, click on the
collection on the left hand pane and select the :guilabel:`Indexes` tab.

  :alt: Indexes view

For each index, |compass-short| displays the following information:

.. list-table::

   * - Name and Definition
     - The name of the index and keys.

   * - Type
     - Regular, text, geospatial or hashed index.

   * - Size
     - How large the index is.

   * - Usage
     - Number of times the index has been used in a lookup since the time
       the index was created or the last server restart.

   * - Properties

     - Any special properties (such as uniqueness, partial) of the
       index.

.. _compass-create-index:

Create an Index
---------------

.. include:: /includes/shared/steps/create-index.rst

Create an Atlas Search Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Atlas Search indexes let you query data in `Atlas Search
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/>`__. For more
information, see :ref:`compass-create-search-index`.

Create an Atlas Vector Search Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Atlas Vector Search indexes enable you to index vector data *and* other data 
types, which facilitates semantic searches on the indexed fields. For more
information, see :ref:`compass-create-vector-search`. 

.. _compass-wildcard-index:

Create a Wildcard Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create :manual:`wildcard indexes </core/index-wildcard/>` to
support queries against unknown or arbitrary fields. To create a
wildcard index in |compass-short|, manually type the wildcard index
field (``<field>.$**``) into the :guilabel:`Select a field name`
input.

.. example::

   Consider a collection where documents contain a ``userMetadata``
   object. The fields within the ``userMetadata`` object may vary
   between documents.

   You can create a wildcard index on ``userMetadata`` to account for
   all potential fields within the object. Type the following into
   the :guilabel:`Select a field name` input:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      userMetadata.$**

   Specify a type (``ascending`` or ``descending``) for your wildcard
   index, then click :guilabel:`Create Index`.

   |compass-short| shows the type of your new index as
   :guilabel:`Wildcard`.

Hide or Unhide an Index
-----------------------

You can :manual:`hide an index </core/index-hidden>` from the query planner to 
evaluate the potential impact of dropping an index without actually dropping the 
index.

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 
   
   .. step:: Hover over the index. 

      From the :guilabel:`Indexes` tab, hover over the index you want to hide.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Hide Index` button.

      Click the closed-eye icon on the right that appears when you hover over 
      your selected index.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Confirm`.
      
      In the dialog box, confirm the index you want to hide. After you confirm 
      your selection, a :guilabel:`Hidden` badge appears under the 
      :guilabel:`Properties` column.

      To unhide your index, repeat steps 1-3. After you unhide your index, 
      |compass-short| removes the :guilabel:`Hidden` badge from the 
      :guilabel:`Properties` column.


.. _compass-drop-index:
.. _compass-drop-an-index:

Drop an Index
-------------

.. include:: /includes/shared/steps/drop-index.rst

Limitations
-----------

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/readonly-not-permitted-indexes.rst

- The :guilabel:`Indexes` tab is not available if you are connected 
  to a :atlas:`Data Lake </data-lake>`. 

- You can manage Atlas Search indexes in |compass-short| if your deployment is
  local, has an Atlas cluster tier of M10 or larger, and runs MongoDB 7.0 
  or higher. 
  
  .. tip::

     For clusters running an earlier version of MongoDB, 
     you can manage your Atlas Search indexes using the Atlas UI, the 
     :ref:`Atlas CLI <atlas-cli>`, or the 
     :ref:`Atlas Administration API <atlas-admin-api>`.
