  sold from either the ``Denver``or ``New York`` store location where

  Your chart should now look something like this:

  .. figure:: /images/charts/order-tutorial-edit-add-filter-2.png
     :figwidth: 750px
     :alt: Edit Chart Add Filter

  Notice how the ``electronics`` tag now takes a larger slice of the
  distribution. You may continue to modify this chart with various
  filters or reset the chart to its initial state by clearing the
  filter.

  .. note::

     If you save your chart with a filter, update the title of your
     chart to reflect the filter. Using the example filter above,
     we can update our title to be:

     .. code-block:: none

        Frequency of Item Tags from Sales in Denver and New York with
        Price Threshold
