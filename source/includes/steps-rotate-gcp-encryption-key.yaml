  a. Click :guilabel:`Google Cloud KMS` if the 
     :guilabel:`Google Cloud KMS` tab is not already active.

  #. Expand :guilabel:`Encryption Key Credentials` if the 
     :guilabel:`Encryption Key Credentials` dialog is not already 
     displayed.

  #. Enter the GCP Key Version Resource ID in the 
     :guilabel:`Key Identifier` entry.

     Include the fully-qualified resource name for a
     :gcp:`CryptoKeyVersion </kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.keyRings.cryptoKeys.cryptoKeyVersions#CryptoKeyVersion>`.

     .. example::

        .. code-block:: sh
           :copyable: false

           projects/my-project-0/locations/us-east4/keyRings/my-key-ring-0/cryptoKeys/my-key-0/cryptoKeyVersions/1

     The encryption key **must** belong to the |gcp| Service Account Key
     configured for your |service| project. Click the :guilabel:`Service
     Account Key` section to view the currently configured Service 
     Account Key for the project.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Update Credentials`.

  |service| displays a banner in the |service| console during the 
  Key Identifier rotation process.
  
  .. warning::

     Do not delete or disable the original Key Version Resource ID until
     your changes have deployed.

  If the cluster uses :ref:`backup-cloud-provider`, do **not** delete
  or disable the original Key Version Resource ID until you
  ensure that no snapshots used that key for encryption.
