   If you are removing documents to save on storage costs, consider
   :atlas:`Online Archive </online-archive/manage-online-archive>` in
   `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud?tck=docs_server>`__. Online
   Archive automatically archives infrequently accessed data to
   fully-managed S3 buckets for cost-effective data
   tiering.

TTL indexes are special single-field indexes that MongoDB can use to
automatically remove documents from a collection after a certain amount
of time or at a specific clock time. Data expiration is useful for certain types of information
like machine generated event data, logs, and session information that
only need to persist in a database for a finite amount of time.

To create a TTL index, use the :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()`
method on a field whose value is either a :ref:`date
<document-bson-type-date>` or an array that contains :ref:`date values
<document-bson-type-date>`, and specify the ``expireAfterSeconds``
option with the desired TTL value in seconds.

For example, to create a TTL index on the ``lastModifiedDate`` field of
the ``eventlog`` collection, with a TTL value of ``3600`` seconds, use
the following operation in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.eventlog.createIndex( { "lastModifiedDate": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 } )

Behavior
--------

Expiration of Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TTL indexes expire documents after the specified number of seconds has
passed since the indexed field value; i.e. the expiration threshold is
the indexed field value plus the specified number of seconds.

If the field is an array, and there are multiple date values in the
index, MongoDB uses *lowest* (i.e. earliest) date value in the array to
calculate the expiration threshold.

If the indexed field in a document is not a :term:`date <bson types>`
or an array that holds a date value(s), the document will not expire.

If a document does not contain the indexed field, the document will not
expire.

Delete Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A background thread in :binary:`~bin.mongod` reads the values in the index
and removes expired :term:`documents <document>` from the collection.

When the TTL thread is active, you will see delete operations in the
output of :method:`db.currentOp()` or in the data collected by the
:ref:`database profiler <database-profiler>`.

Timing of the Delete Operation
``````````````````````````````

MongoDB begins removing expired documents as soon as the index
finishes building on the :term:`primary`. For more information on the
index build process, see :ref:`index-operations`.

Replica Sets
````````````

On :term:`replica set <replica set>` members, the TTL background thread *only*
deletes documents when a member is in state :term:`primary`. The TTL background
thread is idle when a member is in state :term:`secondary`. :term:`Secondary` members replicate
deletion operations from the primary.

Support for Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A TTL index supports queries in the same way non-TTL indexes do.

Restrictions
------------

- TTL indexes are a single-field indexes. :ref:`Compound indexes
  <index-type-compound>` do not support TTL and ignore the
  ``expireAfterSeconds`` option.

- The ``_id`` field does not support TTL indexes.

- You cannot create a TTL index on a :doc:`capped collection
  </core/capped-collections>` because MongoDB cannot remove documents
  from a capped collection.

- You cannot use :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` to change the
  value of ``expireAfterSeconds`` of an existing index. Instead use the
  :dbcommand:`collMod` database command in conjunction with the
  :collflag:`index` collection flag. Otherwise, to change the value of
  the option of an existing index, you must drop the index first and
  recreate.

- If a non-TTL single-field index already exists for a field, you
  cannot create a TTL index on the same field since you cannot create
  indexes that have the same key specification and differ only by the
  options. To change a non-TTL single-field index to a TTL index, you
  must drop the index first and recreate with the
  ``expireAfterSeconds`` option.
