$explain

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. EDITS to explain.txt must be carried over to the method
   cursor.explain.txt and vice versa

.. operator:: $explain

   The :operator:`$explain` operator provides information on the query
   plan. It returns a document that describes
   the process and indexes used to return the query. This may provide
   useful insight when attempting to optimize a query.
   For details on the output, see :doc:`/reference/method/cursor.explain`.

   You can specify the :operator:`$explain` operator in either of the
   following forms:

   .. code-block:: javascript

       db.collection.find()._addSpecial( "$explain", 1 )
       db.collection.find( { $query: {}, $explain: 1 } )

   You also can specify :operator:`$explain` through the
   :method:`~cursor.explain()` method in the :program:`mongo`
   shell:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find().explain()

Behavior
--------

:operator:`$explain` runs the actual query to determine the result.
Although there are some differences between running the query with
:operator:`$explain` and running without, generally, the performance
will be similar between the two. So, if the query is slow, the
:operator:`$explain` operation is also slow.

Additionally, the :operator:`$explain` operation reevaluates a set
of candidate query plans, which may cause the :operator:`$explain`
operation to perform differently than a normal query. As a result,
these operations generally provide an accurate account of *how*
MongoDB would perform the query, but do not reflect the length of
these queries.

To determine the performance of a particular index, you can use
:method:`~cursor.hint()` [#hint-override]_ in conjunction with
:method:`~cursor.explain()`, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.find().hint( { type: 1 } ).explain()

When you run :method:`~cursor.explain()` with :method:`~cursor.hint()`,
the query optimizer does not reevaluate the query plans except in cases
of index filters [#hint-override]_.

.. [#hint-override]
   .. |hint-object| replace:: :operator:`$hint`
   .. |index-filter| replace:: :ref:`index filter <index-filters>`
