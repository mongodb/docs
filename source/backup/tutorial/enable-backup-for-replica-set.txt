===================================
Activate |backup| for a Replica Set
===================================

.. start-content

Overview
--------

You can start, restart, and stop backups for replica sets. As appropriate, you
also can specify which instance to use for the initial sync, exclude
namespaces, authenticate, and change the snapshot schedule. If you use
two-factor authentication for login, you also will need to authenticate to
confirm your actions.

.. note::
   The replica set must be MongoDB version 2.0 or later.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/backup-activate-replica-set.rst

Your Backup agent will start polling the specified instance for this replica
set.

See the :doc:`/backup/faq/` page for more details about backup configuration,
namespaces, authentication, and snapshots.
