   These requirements are not enforced by the database. A failure to
   allocate enough resources can result in:

   - the database running out of space and shutting down
   - decreased performance
   - the operation taking longer than expected

   If your application has time periods with less traffic, perform this
   operation on the collection during that time if possible.
