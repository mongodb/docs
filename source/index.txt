Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the Java Driver, the official
MongoDB driver for synchronous Java applications. Download it using
`Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ or
`Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__, or set up a runnable project by
following our Quick Start guide.

If your Java application requires asynchronous stream processing, use the
:driver:`Reactive Streams Driver </reactive-streams/>` which uses Reactive
Streams to make non-blocking calls to MongoDB.


Quick Start
-----------

Learn how to establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas and begin
working with data in the :doc:`Quick Start </quick-start>` section.

Quick Reference
---------------

See driver syntax examples for common MongoDB commands in the
:ref:`Quick Reference <java-quick-reference>` section.

What's New
----------

For a list of new features and changes in each version, see the
:ref:`What's New <java-whats-new>` section.

Usage Examples
--------------

For fully runnable code snippets and explanations for common
methods, see the :doc:`Usage Examples </usage-examples>` section.
