  - Run {{copydb}} in the ``admin`` database of the destination
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, i.e. the instance receiving the copied
    data.

  - {{copydb}} creates the target database if it does not exist.

  - If the target database exists and no collection from the source database
    exists in the target database,  {{copydb}} copies the collections from
    the source database to the target database.  If any collection from the
    source database exists in the target database, {{copydb}} errors out and
    does not copy any remaining collections from the source database.

  - {{copydb}} requires enough free disk space on the host
    instance for the copied database. Use the :method:`db.stats()`
    operation to check the size of the database on the source
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

ref: _copydb-fromhost-authentication
content: |
  If copying from another :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance (``fromhost``)
  that enforces :setting:`access control <security.authorization>`,
  then you must authenticate to the ``fromhost`` instance by specifying
  the {{credentials}}.

  When authenticating to the ``fromhost`` instance, {{copydb}} uses the
  ``fromdb`` as the :ref:`authentication database
  <authentication-client-users>` for the specified user.
---
ref: _copydb-concurrency
content: |
  - {{copydb}} and :dbcommand:`clone` do not produce
    point-in-time snapshots of the source database. Write traffic to
    the source or destination database during the copy process will
    result in divergent data sets.

  - {{copydb}} does not lock the destination server during
    its operation, so the copy will occasionally yield to allow other
    operations to complete.
