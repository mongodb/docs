.. method:: sh.splitAt(namespace, query)

   :param string namespace: Specify the namespace
                            (i.e. "``<database>.<collection>``") of
                            the sharded collection that contains the
                            chunk to split.

   :param document query: Specify a query to identify a document in a
                          specific chunk. Typically specify the
                          :term:`shard key` for a document as the
                          query.

   Splits the chunk containing the document specified by the ``query``
   as if that document were at the "middle" of the collection, even if
   the specified document is not the actual median of the
   collection. Use this command to manually split chunks unevenly. Use
   the ":method:`sh.splitFind()`" function to split a chunk at the
   actual median.

   In most circumstances, you should leave chunk splitting to the
   automated processes within MongoDB. However, when initially
   deploying a :term:`sharded cluster` it is necessary to perform some
   measure of :term:`pre-splitting` using manual methods including
   :method:`sh.splitAt()`.
