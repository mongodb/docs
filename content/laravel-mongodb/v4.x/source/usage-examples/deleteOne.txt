You can delete a document in a collection by retrieving a single
Eloquent model and calling the ``delete()`` method, or by calling
``delete()`` directly on a query builder.

To delete a document, pass a query filter to the ``where()`` method,
sort the matching documents, and call the ``limit()`` method to retrieve
only the first document. Then, delete this matching document by calling
the ``delete()`` method.

.. tip::

   To learn more about deleting documents with the {+odm-short+}, see
   the :ref:`laravel-fundamentals-delete-documents` section of the Write
   Operations guide.

Example
-------

Select from the following :guilabel:`Eloquent` and :guilabel:`Query
Builder` tabs to view usage examples for the same operation that use
each corresponding query syntax:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Eloquent
      :tabid: eloquent-model-count

      This example performs the following actions:
      
      - Uses the ``Movie`` Eloquent model to represent the ``movies``
        collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database
      - Deletes a document from the ``movies`` collection that matches a
        query filter
      - Prints the number of deleted documents
      
      The example calls the following methods on the ``Movie`` model:
      
      - ``where()``: Matches documents in which the value of the
        ``title`` field is ``"Quiz Show"``
      - ``limit()``: Retrieves only the first matching document
      - ``delete()``: Deletes the retrieved document

            :language: php
            :dedent:
      
         .. output::
            :language: console
            :visible: false
      
            Deleted documents: 1

   .. tab:: Query Builder
      :tabid: query-builder-count

      This example performs the following actions:
      
      - Accesses the ``movies`` collection by calling the ``table()``
        method from the ``DB`` facade
      - Deletes a document from the ``movies`` collection that matches a
        query filter
      - Prints the number of deleted documents
      
      The example calls the following query builder methods:
      
      - ``where()``: Matches documents in which the value of the
        ``title`` field is ``"Quiz Show"``
      - ``limit()``: Retrieves only the first matching document
      - ``delete()``: Deletes the retrieved document

            Deleted documents: 1
