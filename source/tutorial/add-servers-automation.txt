Provision Servers for Automation
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| can automate operations for the MongoDB processes running on your
servers. |mms| can both discover existing processes and deploy new ones.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can provision servers for automation you must meet the
following prerequisites.

Server Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each server must meet the following requirements.

- At least 10 GB of free disk space plus whatever space is necessary to
  hold your MongoDB data.

- At least 4 GB of RAM.

- If you use Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, we recommend at
  least an ``m3.medium`` instance.

MongoDB Enterprise Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you will run :term:`MongoDB Enterprise`,
you must manually install a set of dependencies to each
server **before installing MongoDB**. The MongoDB manual provides the
appropriate command to install the dependencies. See the link for the
server's operating system:

.. include:: /includes/list-links-per-os-for-enterprise-dependencies.rst

Procedure
---------

Install the Automation Agent on each each server that you want |mms| to
manage. The following procedure applies to all operating systems. For
instructions for a specific operating system, see
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent`.

On Linux servers, if you installed MongoDB with a package manager, use the
same package manager to install the Automation Agent. If you installed
MongoDB without a package manager, use an archive to install the
Automation Agent.

Next Steps
----------

Once you have installed the agent to all your servers, you can deploy your
first :doc:`replica set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>`, :doc:`cluster
</tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster>`, or :doc:`standalone
</tutorial/deploy-standalone>`.
