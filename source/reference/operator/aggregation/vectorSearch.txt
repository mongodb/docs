$vectorSearch (aggregation)
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

``$vectorSearch`` performs a semantic search on data in your Atlas
cluster. If you store vector embeddings that are less than and equal to
2048 dimensions in width for any kind of data along with other data in
your collection on the Atlas cluster, you can seamlessly index the vector
data along with your other data. You can then use the
:pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage to pre-filter you data and perform
semantic search against the indexed fields. See:

- :atlas:`Index Vector Embeddings
  </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-type/>` to learn more about
  creating Atlas Vector Search indexes.
- :atlas:`Vector Search Queries
  </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage/>` to learn more about 
  :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` pipeline stage syntax and usage.

.. important:: 

   The ``$vectorSearch`` aggregation pipeline stage is only available
   for collections hosted on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` cluster tiers 
   running MongoDB version 6.0.11 or later. To learn more, see 
   :atlas:`Atlas Vector Search
   </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>`.
