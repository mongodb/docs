Definition
----------

.. versionadded:: 3.6

.. query:: $expr

   Allows the use of aggregation expressions within the query 
   language. 

   :query:`$expr` has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $expr: { <expression> } }

   The arguments can be any valid :ref:`expression 
   <aggregation-expressions>`. For more information on expressions, see
   :ref:`aggregation-expressions`.

Behavior
--------

- :query:`$expr` can build query expressions that compare fields 
  from the same document in a :pipeline:`$match` stage.

   - If the :pipeline:`$match` stage is part of a :pipeline:`$lookup`
     stage, :query:`$expr` can compare fields using ``let`` variables.
     See :ref:`lookup-multiple-joins` for an example. 

   - :query:`$expr` only uses indexes on the ``from`` collection for
     equality matches in a :pipeline:`$match` stage.

- :query:`$expr` does not support
  :ref:`multikey indexes <index-type-multikey>`.

Examples
--------

Compare Two Fields from A Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider an ``monthlyBudget`` collection with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "category" : "food", "budget": 400, "spent": 450 }
   { "_id" : 2, "category" : "drinks", "budget": 100, "spent": 150 }
   { "_id" : 3, "category" : "clothes", "budget": 100, "spent": 50 }
   { "_id" : 4, "category" : "misc", "budget": 500, "spent": 300 }
   { "_id" : 5, "category" : "travel", "budget": 200, "spent": 650 }

The following operation uses :query:`$expr` to find documents 
where the ``spent`` amount exceeds the ``budget``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.monthlyBudget.find( { $expr: { $gt: [ "$spent" , "$budget" ] } } )

The operation returns the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "category" : "food", "budget" : 400, "spent" : 450 }
   { "_id" : 2, "category" : "drinks", "budget" : 100, "spent" : 150 }
   { "_id" : 5, "category" : "travel", "budget" : 200, "spent" : 650 }


Using ``$expr`` With Conditional Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some queries require the ability to execute conditional logic when 
defining a query  filter. The aggregation framework provides the
:expression:`cond` operator for applying  conditional logic to a
pipeline stage. You can use :query:`$expr` with the :expression:`$cond` 
operator to query based on conditional modifications to the source data.

Consider a ``supplies`` collection with the following documents. Each 
document in the ``supplies`` collection represents an item, its 
quantity, and its price:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "item" : "binder", "qty" : 100 , "price" : 12 }
   { "_id" : 2, "item" : "notebook", "qty" : 200 , "price" : 8 }
   { "_id" : 3, "item" : "pencil", "qty" : 50 , "price" : 6 }
   { "_id" : 4, "item" : "eraser", "qty" : 150 , "price" : 3 }
   { "_id" : 5, "item" : "legal pad", "qty" : 42 , "price" : 10}

An application automatically applies a ``50%`` discount to the price of
any item  with a quantity of more than ``100``. Otherwise, the
application applies a ``25%``  discount to the price.

A user needs to know which items in the ``supplies`` collection have a
discounted  price of less than ``5``. The user writes a query that:

1. Uses conditional logic to identify the discount applicable to a given
   document.

2. Calculates that document's discounted price. 
  
3. Only returns documents whose discounted price is less than ``5``. 
  
The query returns only documents from the ``supplies`` collection whose 
discounted price is less than ``5``. 

The following operation implements the previous steps using the
:query:`$expr` operator  to access the :expression:`cond` and
:expression:`$lt` aggregation operators:

.. code-block:: javascript

    db.supplies.find( {
        $expr: { 
           $lt:[ { 
              $cond: {
                 if: { $gte: ["$qty", 100] },
                 then: { $multiply: ["$price", 0.50] },
                 else: { $multiply: ["$price", 0.75] }
               }
           }, 
           5 ] }
    } )


- :expression:`$cond` modifies the input document depending on the value
  of ``qty``.  Specifically, it compares the ``qty`` using
  :expression:`$gte` and modifies the price  using
  :expression:`$multiply`.

  - The document ``_id : 1`` has a ``qty`` of 100. :expression:`$cond`
    returns  the result of multiplying the ``price`` by ``0.50``,
    effectively applying a ``50%`` discount,  yielding a value of ``6``.

  - The document ``id : 3`` has a ``qty`` of ``50``. :expression:`$cond`
    returns the result of  multiplying the ``price`` by ``0.75``,
    effectively applying a ``25%`` discount, yielding a  value of ``4``.

- :expression:`$lt` compares the returned value to the provided value 
  ``5``. 

  - The document ``_id : 1`` returns ``6`` from :expression:`cond`.
    Since ``$lt [6, 5]``  evaluates to false, the expression does not 
    return the document.

  - The document ``_id : 3`` returns ``4`` from :expression:`cond`.
    Since ``$lt [4, 5]``  evaluates to true, the expression returns the
    document.

:method:`~db.collection.find()` continues to apply :expression:`$cond`
to each document in the  ``supplies`` collection. The operation returns
the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 2, "item" : "notebook", "qty": 200 , "price": 8 }
   { "_id" : 3, "item" : "pencil", "qty": 50 , "price": 6 }
   { "_id" : 4, "item" : "eraser", "qty": 150 , "price": 3 }

:expression:`$cond` modifies the input documents as part of the query
filtering but does  not persist the modifications to disk. The results
represent the matching  documents in their original state. The find
operation did not return the  ``binder`` or ``legal pad`` documents, as
their modified price was greater than  ``5``. Specifically:

- ``binder`` has a quantity of ``200``. The :expression:`$cond` logic
  applies a ``.75``  multiplier which resolves to ``6``. Since ``6`` is
  greater than ``5``,  :method:`~db.collection.find()` filters out the
  ``binder`` document.

- ``legal pad`` has a quantity of ``42``. The :expression:`$cond` logic
  applies a ``.50``  multiplier which resolves to ``5``. Since the
  operation used the :expression:`$lt`  operator, the modified price is
  not less than ``5`` and :method:`~db.collection.find()`  filters out 
  the ``legal pad`` document.
