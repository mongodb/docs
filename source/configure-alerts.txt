         When you configure an alert, you select how notifications are
         sent. You can select multiple notification methods, such as
         email, text message, or team collaboration tools.

         |service| supports Slack as a notification method. From the
         organization's :guilabel:`Settings` menu, click
         :guilabel:`Add to Slack` in :guilabel:`Slack` Settings and
         log in to your preferred Slack workspace.

         |service| supports configuring all of the following
         notification methods during alert configuration:

         - |service| Organization

         - |service| User

         - Email
      
         - SMS

         sent. You can select multiple notification methods, such as
         email, text message, or team collaboration tools.

         To use certain notification methods, you must first set up
         notification methods in the project's :guilabel:`Settings`.
         If the notification method's value becomes invalid, |service|
         sends an email to the project owner. The following
         notification methods require set up in the project's
         :guilabel:`Settings`:

         - |service| Project

         - |service| User

         - Email
