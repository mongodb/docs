  .. msetting:: sslRequireValidMMSServerCertificates

     *Type*: boolean

     Specifies if |mms| should validate SSL certificates.

     Set this option to ``false`` to disable certificate verification.

  .. warning::

     Setting this option to ``false`` is only recommended for testing
     purposes. It makes connections between |mms| and MongoDB
     databases susceptible to *man-in-the-middle* attacks.

  .. msetting:: sslServerClientCertificate

     *Type*: string

     Specifies the path to the file containing the client's private
     key, certificate, and optional intermediate certificates in
     ``PEM`` format. The Monitoring Agent uses the client certificate
     when connecting to |onprem| over SSL if |onprem| requires client
     certificates, such as when |onprem| runs with :setting:`Client
     Certificate Mode` set to ``Required for Agents Only`` or
     ``Required for All Requests``.

     .. seealso::
        See :setting:`Client Certificate Mode` in
        :doc:`/reference/configuration` for how to specify this
        setting in the |application|.

     .. code-block:: ini

        sslServerClientCertificate=/path/to/client.pem

  .. msetting:: sslServerClientCertificatePassword

     Specifies the password needed to decrypt the private key in
     the ``sslServerClientCertificate`` file. This setting is
     required when the client certificate ``PEM`` file is
     encrypted.

     .. code-block:: ini

        sslServerClientCertificatePassword=password
