Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform
**compound operations**.

Compound operations combine the functionality of read and write
operations into one :manual:`atomic </reference/glossary/#std-term-atomic-operation>` action. If you perform
a read operation and a write operation in sequence, someone might change
your target document between the operations, leading to unexpected
results. When you perform a compound operation, MongoDB prevents
intermediate data changes by placing a write lock on the document you
are modifying until the operation completes.

You can perform the following compound operations with the driver:

- Find and delete one document
- Find and update one document
- Find and replace one document

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Sample Data for Examples <rust-compound-sample-data>` presents
  the sample data that is used by the compound operation examples

- :ref:`Find and Delete a Document <rust-find-and-delete>` describes
  how to find and delete a document in a single operation

- :ref:`Find and Update a Document <rust-find-and-update>` describes
  how to find and update a document in a single operation

- :ref:`Find and Replace a Document <rust-find-and-replace>` describes
  how to find and replace a document in a single operation

- :ref:`Additional Information <rust-crud-compound-addtl-info>`
  provides links to resources and API documentation for types
  and methods mentioned in this guide

.. tip::

   To learn how to perform atomic read and write operations on more than one
   document at a time, see the :ref:`rust-transactions` guide.

.. _rust-compound-sample-data:

Sample Data for Examples
------------------------

The examples in this guide use the following sample documents. Each
document represents a student and contains information about their age
and the school that they attend:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   
   { "name": "Alex Johnson", "age": 8, "school": "Lakeside Elementary" },
   { "name": "Samara Khan", "age": 11, "school": "Rolling Hills Middle School" },
   { "name": "Ben Joseph", "age": 16, "school": "Aurora High School" },
   { "name": "Deanna Porowski", "age": 10, "school": "Lakeside Elementary" }

.. _rust-find-and-delete:

Find and Delete a Document
--------------------------

The ``find_one_and_delete()`` method finds and deletes the first document that
matches the specified query filter. If a document matches the filter
criteria, the method returns a ``Some`` type. If no documents match,
it returns a ``None`` type.

.. note:: 

   If you want to perform other operations between finding and deleting
   a document, you can call the ``find_one()`` method followed by the
   ``delete_one()`` method.

Modify Find and Delete Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can optionally modify the behavior of the ``find_one_and_delete()``
method by chaining option builder methods to ``find_one_and_delete()``. These
builder methods set ``FindOneAndDeleteOptions`` struct fields.

The following table describes the options available in
``FindOneAndDeleteOptions``:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Description

   * - ``max_time`` 
     - | The maximum amount of time in milliseconds that the query can
         run.
       |
       | Type: ``Duration``

   * - ``projection`` 
     - | The projection to use when returning results.
       |
       | Type: ``Document``
       | Default: ``None``

   * - ``sort``
     - | The sorting order to use when returning results. By default, the driver
         returns documents in their natural order, or as they appear in
         the database. To learn more, see :manual:`natural order </reference/glossary/#std-term-natural-order>`
         in the Server manual glossary.
       |
       | Type: ``Document``
       | Default: ``None``

   * - ``write_concern``
     - | The write concern for the operation. If you don't set this
         option, the operation inherits the write concern set for
         the collection. To learn more about write concerns, see
         :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>` in the
         Server manual.
       |
       | Type: ``WriteConcern``

   * - ``collation`` 
     - | The collation to use when sorting results. To learn more about collations,
         see the :ref:`rust-collations` guide.
       |
       | Type: ``Collation``
       | Default: ``None``

   * - ``hint`` 
     - | The index to use for the operation. To learn more about
         indexes, see :manual:`Indexes </indexes/>` in the Server
         manual. This option is available only when connecting to
         {+server+} versions 4.4 and later.
       |
       | Type: ``Hint``
       | Default: ``None``

   * - ``let_vars``
     - | A map of parameters and values. You can access these parameters
         as variables in aggregation expressions. This option is available
         only when connecting to {+server+} versions 5.0 and later.
       |
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``comment``
     - | An arbitrary ``Bson`` value tied to the operation to trace
         it through the database profiler, ``currentOp``, and
         logs. This option is available only when connecting to
         {+server+} versions 4.4 and later.
       |
       | Type: ``Bson``
       | Default: ``None``

.. TODO add links to guides for relevant options

.. note:: Setting Options
   
   You can set ``FindOneAndDeleteOptions`` fields by chaining option builder methods directly
   to the ``find_one_and_delete()`` method call. If you're using an earlier version of the driver,
   you must construct a ``FindOneAndDeleteOptions`` instance by chaining option builder methods
   to the ``builder()`` method. Then, pass your options instance as a parameter to ``find_one_and_delete()``.

The following code shows how to set the ``comment`` field by chaining
the ``comment()`` method to the ``find_one_and_delete()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/compound.rs
   :start-after: begin-find-delete-options
   :end-before: end-find-delete-options
   :language: rust
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Find and Delete Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``find_one_and_delete()`` method 
to match and delete the first document where the value of the ``age`` 
field is less than or equal to ``10``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/compound.rs
      :start-after: begin-find_one_and_delete
      :end-before: end-find_one_and_delete
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Deleted document:
      Some(Document({"_id": ObjectId("..."),
      "name": String("Deanna Porowski"), "age": Int32(10), "school":
      String("Lakeside Elementary")}))

.. _rust-find-and-update:

Find and Update a Document
--------------------------

The ``find_one_and_update()`` method finds and updates the first
document that matches the specified query filter. The operation updates
the document based on the specifications you provide in an update
document. If a document matches the filter criteria, the method returns
a ``Some`` type. If no documents match, it returns a ``None`` type.

.. note:: 

   If you want to perform other operations between finding and updating
   a document, you can call the ``find_one()`` method followed by the
   ``update_one()`` method.

Modify Find and Update Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can optionally modify the behavior of the ``find_one_and_update()``
method by chaining option builder methods to ``find_one_and_update()``. These
builder methods set ``FindOneAndUpdateOptions`` struct fields.

The following table describes the options available in
``FindOneAndUpdateOptions``:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option

     - | The set of filters specifying the array elements to which the
         update applies.
       |
       | Type: ``Vec<Document>``

   * - ``bypass_document_validation``
     - | If ``true``, allows the driver to perform a write that violates
         document-level validation. To learn more about validation, see
         :manual:`Schema Validation </core/schema-validation>` in the Server manual.
       |

Find and Update Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to perform the following actions:

- Call the ``find_one_and_update()`` method
- Pass a query filter to ``find_one_and_update()`` that matches a document where the
  value of ``school`` is ``"Aurora High School"``
- Pass an update document to ``find_one_and_update()`` that sets the ``school`` field to
  ``"Durango High School"`` and increments the ``age`` field by ``1``
- Chain the ``return_document()`` method to ``find_one_and_update()`` to return
  the matched document *after* the update

      "name": String("Ben Joseph"), "age": Int32(17), "school":
      String("Durango High School")}))

.. _rust-find-and-replace:

Find and Replace a Document
---------------------------

The ``find_one_and_replace()`` method finds and replaces the first
document that matches the specified query filter. The operation replaces
all the fields of the document except the ``_id`` field with fields
and values that you provide. If a document matches the filter criteria,
the method returns a ``Some`` type. If no documents match, it returns a
``None`` type.

.. note:: 

   If you want to perform other operations between finding and replacing
   a document, you can call the ``find_one()`` method followed by the
   ``replace_one()`` method.
