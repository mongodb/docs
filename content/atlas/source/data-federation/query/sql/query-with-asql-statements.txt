The page gives example {+asql+} queries.
You'll find basic examples that use SQL syntax to query collections,
as well more advanced ones that use ``FLATTEN`` and ``UNWIND`` to work with nested data.

Example Queries
---------------

Try running the following {+asql+} queries against the 
:ref:`sql-getting-started` sample {+fdi+}, or modify them to read your 
own data.

.. note::

   These examples use :ref:`short-form syntax <short-sql-syntax>`.

SELECT Statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: true

   SELECT * FROM sessions;

{+asql+} returns all documents from the ``Sessions`` collection.

LIMIT Statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: true
      
   SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 2;

{+asql+} returns two documents from the ``Users`` collection.

WHERE Statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: true
      
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Jon Snow';

{+asql+} returns documents from the ``Users`` collection where the user's ``name`` is ``Jon Snow``.

WITH Keyword 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``WITH`` keyword makes it easier to create derived data sources for
subsequent use.  

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: true

   WITH RecentSales AS (
     SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
     FROM sales
     WHERE sale_date > '2025-01-01'
     GROUP BY customer_id
   )
   SELECT customer_id, total_sales
   FROM RecentSales
   WHERE total_sales > 1000;

{+asql+} returns documents from the ``Sales`` collection that have
``customer_id`` with total sales greater than 1000 after January 1,
2025.  
 
.. _asql-flatten-and-unwind:

FLATTEN and UNWIND
------------------

This section covers two {+asql+} capabilities that make it easier to interact with document structures.
These are unique to {+asql+}.

FLATTEN
~~~~~~~

``FLATTEN`` flattens semi-structured data (name-value pairs in 
JSON) into separate columns. Field names become column names that hold 
all of the values for that field in rows.

The syntax for flattening nested documents is a ``FLATTEN`` function 
that can be used in the ``FROM`` clause in conjunction with a data 
source and options.

.. code-block::

   SELECT * 
   FROM FLATTEN(<data source> 
    WITH DEPTH => <integer>, 
    SEPARATOR => <string>
   )

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Variable
     - Necessity
     - Description

   * - <data source>
     - Required
     - Data source to flatten.

   * - ``DEPTH``
     - Optional
     - Positive integer indicating how many levels of subdocuments to 
       flatten. Defaults to flattening every level of subdocuments.

   * - ``SEPARATOR``
     - Optional
     - String to use as the delimiter when concatenating 
       field names. Defaults to ``_``.

.. _asql-flatten-example:
       
Flatten Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In an example scenario, a ``customerInfo`` collection contains 
documents that are structured as follows:

.. code-block:: json
   
   { 
     id: 1,
     location: "New York",
     customer: {
       age: 50,
       email: "customer@email.com",
       satisfaction: 5
     }
   }

If you run the query ``SELECT * FROM customerInfo``, 
{+asql+} returns documents with the following top-level fields:

.. list-table::

   * - ``id``
     - 1

   * - ``location``
     - "New York"

   * - ``customer``
     - { age: 50, email: "customer@email.com", satisfaction: 5 }

If you run the query ``SELECT * FROM FLATTEN(customerInfo)``, 
{+asql+} returns documents with the following top-level fields:

.. list-table::

   * - ``id``
     - 1

   * - ``location``
     - "New York"

   * - ``customer_age``
     - 50

   * - ``customer_email``
     - "customer@email.com"

   * - ``customer_satisfaction``
     - 5

When you use ``FLATTEN``, each flattened field from the original 
document becomes a top-level field in the result set. Nested fields are 
concatenated with their parent field names and separated by the default 
delimiter, ``_``.

UNWIND
~~~~~~

``UNWIND`` deconstructs an array field from the input data source to 
output one row for each item in that array. To learn more about 
unwinding, see the 
:manual:`$unwind </reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/>` aggregation 
stage documentation.

The syntax for unwinding array fields is an ``UNWIND`` function that 
can be used in the ``FROM`` clause in conjunction with a data source 
and options.

.. code-block::

   SELECT * 
   FROM UNWIND(<data source> 
    WITH PATH | PATHS => <array_paths>, 
    INDEX => <identifier>, 
    OUTER => <bool>
   )

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Variable
     - Necessity
     - Description

   * - <data source>
     - Required
     - Source of the array field to unwind.

   * - ``PATH`` | ``PATHS``
     - Required
     - Path to the field in the data source to 
       unwind. Use parentheses to specify multiple paths. 

   * - ``INDEX``
     - Optional
     - Name to assign the index column. If omitted, {+asql+} does 
       not create an index field.

   * - ``OUTER``
     - Optional
     - Flag that indicates whether documents with null, missing, or 
       empty array values are preserved. If ``true``, documents with 
       null, missing, or empty array values are preserved. Defaults to 
       ``false``.

Unwind Example: Top Level Fields 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In an example scenario, a ``customerInfo`` collection contains 
documents that are structured as follows:

.. code-block:: json
   
   { 
     id: 1,
     location: "New York",
     customer: {
       age: 50,
       email: "customer@email.com",
       satisfaction: 5
     },
     visits: [
       {
         year: 2020,
         score: 10
       },
       {
         year: 2021,
         score: 8
       },
       {
         year: 2022
         score: 7
       }
     ]
   }

If you run the query ``SELECT * FROM customerInfo``, 
{+asql+} returns documents with the following top-level fields:

.. list-table::

   * - ``id``
     - 1

   * - ``location``
     - "New York"

   * - ``customer``
     - { age: 50, email: "customer@email.com", satisfaction: 5 }

   * - ``visits``
     - [ { year: 2020, score: 10 }, { year: 2021, score: 8 }, { year: 2022, score: 7 } ]

If you run the query 
``SELECT * FROM UNWIND(customerInfo WITH PATH => visits, INDEX => idx)``, 
{+asql+} returns documents with the following top-level fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 22 26 26 26

   * - ``id``
     - 1
     - 1
     - 1

   * - ``location``
     - "New York"
     - "New York"
     - "New York"

   * - ``customer``
     - { age: 50, email: "customer@email.com", satisfaction: 5 }
     - { age: 50, email: "customer@email.com", satisfaction: 5 }
     - { age: 50, email: "customer@email.com", satisfaction: 5 }

   * - ``idx``
     - 0
     - 1
     - 2

   * - ``visits``
     - { year: 2020, score: 10 }
     - { year: 2021, score: 8 }
     - { year: 2022, score: 7 }
     
When you use ``UNWIND`` with ``PATH => visits``, each ``visits`` object 
becomes a table row.

Unwind Example: Nested and Sibling Arrays 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In an example scenario, a ``customerInfo`` collection contains 
documents that are structured as follows:

.. code-block:: json
   
   {  
     "id": 1,  
     "location": "New York",  
     "customer": {  
       "age": 50,  
       "email": "customer@email.com",  
       "satisfaction": 5  
     },  
     "visits": [  
       {  
         "year": 2020,  
         "score": 10  
       },  
       {  
         "year": 2021,  
         "score": 8  
       },  
       {  
         "year": 2022,  
         "score": 7  
       }  
     ],  
     "purchases": [  
       {  
         "transaction": "1A",  
         "transactions": [  
           {  
             "amount": 100  
           },  
           {  
             "amount": 150  
           }  
         ]  
       },  
       {  
         "transaction": "2B",  
         "transactions": [  
           {  
             "amount": 200  
           }  
         ]  
       }  
     ]  
   }  

Suppose you run the following query:

.. code-block:: javascript 

   SELECT v.year AS visit_year, v.score AS visit_score, p.transaction AS transaction_id, t.amount AS purchase_amount  
   FROM UNWIND(  
     customerInfo WITH PATHS => (  
       visits[INDEX => visit_idx],  
       purchases[OUTER => TRUE, INDEX => purchase_idx].transactions[]  
     ),  
     INDEX => idx,  
     OUTER => FALSE  
   )  

The preceding query does the following:

- Unwinds the ``visits`` array and assigns an index name ``visit_idx`` to
  track the index position inside the unwound array. 
- Unwinds the ``purchases`` array and unwinds the ``transactions`` array inside each ``purchases`` object. It
  also preserves any purchase with a missing or empty ``transactions``
  array by using ``OUTER => TRUE``.

{+asql+} returns documents with the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 22 26 26 26
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ``visit_year``
     - ``visit_score``
     - ``transaction_id``
     - ``purchase_amount``

   * - 2020
     - 10
     - 1A
     - 100

   * - 2020
     - 10
     - 2B
     - 150

   * - 2021
     - 8
     - 1A
     - 100

   * - 2021
     - 8
     - 2B
     - 150

In the results, each row contains data from a single ``visits`` entry
and a single ``transactions`` entry.

Combined FLATTEN and UNWIND Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example combines the ``FLATTEN`` and ``UNWIND`` functions.

In an example scenario, a ``customerInfo`` collection contains 
documents that are structured as follows:

.. code-block:: json
   
   { 
     id: 1,
     location: "New York",
     customer: {
       age: 50,
       email: "customer@email.com",
       satisfaction: 5
     },
     visits: [
       {
         year: 2020,
         score: 10
       },
       {
         year: 2021,
         score: 8
       },
       {
         year: 2022
         score: 7
       }
     ]
   }

If you run the query ``SELECT * FROM customerInfo``, 
{+asql+} returns documents with the following top-level fields:

.. list-table::

   * - ``id``
     - 1

   * - ``location``
     - "New York"

   * - ``satisfaction``
     - 5

   * - ``customer``
     - { age: 50, email: "customer@email.com", satisfaction: 5 }

   * - ``visits``
     - [ { year: 2020, score: 10 }, { year: 2021, score: 8 }, { year: 2022, score: 7 } ]

If you run the query 
``Select * from FLATTEN(UNWIND(customerInfo WITH PATH => visits, INDEX => idx))``, 
{+asql+} returns documents with the following top-level fields:

.. list-table::

   * - ``id``
     - 1
     - 1
     - 1

   * - ``location``
     - "New York"
     - "New York"
     - "New York"

   * - ``satisfaction``
     - 5
     - 5
     - 5

   * - ``customer_age``
     - 50
     - 50
     - 50

   * - ``customer_email``
     - "customer@email.com"
     - "customer@email.com"
     - "customer@email.com"

   * - ``idx``
     - 0
     - 1
     - 2

   * - ``visits_year``
     - 2020
     - 2021
     - 2022

   * - ``visits_score``
     - 10
     - 8
     - 7

When you use both the ``FLATTEN`` and ``UNWIND`` functions,
the ``visits`` array is unwound, and the resulting document is then
flattened.
