  Edit the agent configuration file to set the
  ``sslTrustedServerCertificates`` field to the path of a file containing
  one or more certificates in PEM format. For example:
action:
  language: ini
  code: |
    sslTrustedServerCertificates=/path/to/mongodb-certs.pem

  By default, to connect to MongoDB instances using SSL requires a
  valid trusted certificate. For testing purposes, however, you can set
  the :bsetting:`sslRequireValidServerCertificates` setting to
  ``False`` to bypass this check. This configuration is **not**
  recommended for production use as it makes the connection insecure.

  For additional information on these settings, see
  :ref:`backup-mongodb-ssl-settings`.
