Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to connect to MongoDB instances with
the TLS security protocol.

To configure your connection to use TLS, enable
the TLS option and provide your certificates for validation.

.. tip::
   
   To learn more about TLS, see the Wikipedia entry on
   :wikipedia:`Transport Layer Security <Transport_Layer_Security>`.

.. _node-enable-tls:

Enable TLS
----------

You can enable TLS on a connection to your MongoDB instance
in the following ways:

- Setting the ``tls`` option to ``true`` in your ``MongoClientOptions`` object
- Setting the ``tls`` option to ``true`` in your connection string

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoClientOptions
      :tabid: mongoclientoptions

      A ``MongoClient`` instance can connect with TLS if you set ``tls``
      to ``true`` in your ``MongoClientOptions`` object:
      
      .. code-block:: js
         
         const client = new MongoClient(uri, { tls: true });

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: connection string

      A ``MongoClient`` instance can connect with TLS if you set the
      ``tls`` option to ``true`` in your connection string:

      .. code-block:: js
         :emphasize-lines: 1

         const uri = "mongodb://<hostname>:<port>?tls=true";
         const client = new MongoClient(uri, myClientSettings);

.. note::
   
   If you use a DNS SRV record when connecting to MongoDB by specifying
   the ``+srv`` modification in your connection string, you enable
   TLS on your connection by default. To disable it, set the ``tls`` or ``ssl`` parameter
   value to ``false`` in your connection string or ``MongoClientOptions`` object.
   
   To learn more about connection behavior when you use a DNS seedlist,
   see the :manual:`SRV Connection Format </reference/connection-string/#srv-connection-format>`
   section in the Server manual.

.. note:: Workaround for an "unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled" Error

   The {+driver-short+} depends on OpenSSL by default. Outdated SSL proxies can 
   cause an ``unsafe legacy renegotiation disabled`` error in environments using 
   OpenSSL 3.0 or later. You can resolve this error by setting the 
   ``SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT`` option, as shown in the following example: 

   .. code-block:: js
      :emphasize-lines: 6

      import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';
      import crypto from 'crypto';

      const client = new MongoClient("mongodb+srv://...", {
         secureContext: {
            secureOptions: crypto.constants.SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT
         }
      });
   
In addition to the ``tls`` client option, the driver provides more
options to configure TLS on your connection. For **testing purposes**,
you can set the ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames``,
``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates``, and ``tlsInsecure`` client options.

Setting the ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`` option to ``true`` disables
hostname verification, and setting the
``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` to ``true`` disables certificate
validation. Setting the ``tlsInsecure`` option to ``true`` disables
both certificate and hostname validation.
   
.. warning::

   Specifying any of these options in a production environment makes
   your application insecure and potentially
   vulnerable to expired certificates and to foreign processes posing
   as valid client instances.

For a full list of client options, see :ref:`node-connection-options`.

.. _node-configure-tls-certificates:

Configure Certificates
----------------------

To successfully initiate a TLS request, an application must prove its
identity by referencing cryptographic certificates. To connect to
MongoDB with TLS, your certificates must be stored as PEM
files.

.. important::

   For production use, we recommend that your MongoDB deployment use valid
   certificates generated and signed by the same certificate authority.
   For testing, you can use self-signed certificates.

The following list describes the components required to establish
a connection with TLS:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - TLS Component
     - Description

   * - Certificate Authority (CA)
     - One or more certificate authorities to
       trust when making a TLS connection.

   * - Client Certificate
     - A digital certificate and key that allow the server to verify the identity
       of your application to establish an encrypted network connection.

   * - Certificate Key
     - The client certificate private key file. This key is often
       included within the certificate file itself.

   * - Passphrase
     - The password to decrypt the private client key if it is encrypted.

.. tip::
   
   To learn more about the PEM format, see the Wikipedia entry on
   :wikipedia:`Privacy-Enhanced Mail <Privacy-Enhanced_Mail>`.

.. _node-client-tls-connect:

Reference Certificates in a Client
----------------------------------

You must reference your certificates in your ``MongoClientOptions``
object so that the server can validate them before the client connects.
You can reference your certificates in the following ways:

- Create a ``SecureContext`` object to store certificates *(Recommended)*
- Provide filepath strings that point to your certificates
- Create ``Buffer`` objects to store certificates

.. _node-tls-securecontext:

Create a SecureContext Object to Store Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend that you use the ``secureContext`` option to configure
your TLS connection. ``SecureContext`` objects are native to Node.js
and allow you to keep all your TLS options in a single reusable object.

To create a ``SecureContext`` object, import the ``createSecureContext()``
method from the ``tls`` module. Next, call the ``createSecureContext()``
method and pass the contents of your certificates in the options parameter.
This method returns a ``SecureContext`` object that you can use in your
``MongoClientOptions`` object.

The following code shows how to create a ``SecureContext`` object and
pass it to your client:

.. code-block:: js
   :emphasize-lines: 2-6, 9
   
   // Create a SecureContext object
   const secureContext = tls.createSecureContext({
     ca: fs.readFileSync(`<path to CA certificate>`),
     cert: fs.readFileSync(`<path to public client certificate>`),
     key: fs.readFileSync(`<path to private client key>`),
   });
   
   // Pass the SecureContext as a client option
   const client = new MongoClient(uri, { tls: true, secureContext });

To learn more about the ``createSecureContext()`` method and the
``tls`` package, see the `Node.js TLS API documentation
<https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions>`__.

For a runnable example that uses a ``SecureContext`` object, see
the :ref:`SecureContext Example <node-securecontext-full-example>`.

.. _node-tls-filepaths:

Provide Certificate Filepaths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can include the filepaths for your certificates as client options to
retrieve your certificates while connecting with TLS. The driver reads
these files when you call the ``connect()`` method on your
``MongoClient`` instance.

The following code shows how to provide certificate filepaths as options
in your ``MongoClient``:

.. code-block:: js
   :emphasize-lines: 4-5
   
   // Pass filepaths as client options
   const client = new MongoClient(uri, {
     tls: true,
     tlsCAFile: `<path to CA certificate>`,
     tlsCertificateKeyFile: `<path to private client key>`,
   });

.. note:: CRL Files
   
   Your TLS configuration might require that you present a certificate
   revocation list (CRL) when connecting to MongoDB. Starting in version
   6.0 of the driver, you can pass the filepath of your CRL file to the
   ``tlsCRLFile`` option in your connection string or your
   ``MongoClientOptions`` instance.

Create Buffer Objects to Store Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pass the contents of your certificate files as ``Buffer``
objects in your client options to connect with TLS.

The following code shows how to read the contents of your certificate
files and pass the resulting ``Buffer`` objects as options in your
``MongoClient``:

.. code-block:: js
   :emphasize-lines: 2-4, 7
   
   // Read file contents
   const ca = fs.readFileSync(`<path to CA certificate>`);
   const cert = fs.readFileSync(`<path to public client certificate>`);
   const key = fs.readFileSync(`<path to private client key>`);

   // Pass Buffers as client options
   const client = new MongoClient(uri, { tls: true, ca, cert, key });

.. _node-securecontext-full-example:

SecureContext Example
---------------------

This example shows how to create a ``SecureContext`` object and
a ``MongoClient`` instance that includes TLS options. The example
connects to MongoDB and executes a find query:

.. code-block:: js
   
   import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";
   import * as fs from "fs";
   import * as tls from "tls";
   
   // Replace the uri string with your connection string.
   const uri = "<connection uri>";
   
   // Replace the filepaths with your certificate filepaths.
   const secureContext = tls.createSecureContext({
     ca: fs.readFileSync(`<path to CA certificate>`),
     cert: fs.readFileSync(`<path to public client certificate>`),
     key: fs.readFileSync(`<path to private client key>`),
   });
   
   // Create a client with the secureContext option
   const client = new MongoClient(uri, { tls: true, secureContext });
   
   async function run() {
     try {
       const db = client.db("myDB");
       const myColl = db.collection("myColl");
       const doc = await myColl.findOne({});   
       console.log(doc);
     } finally {
       await client.close();
     }
   }
   run().catch(console.dir);
