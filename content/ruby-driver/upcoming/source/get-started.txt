Overview
--------

The {+driver-long+} is a library that allows Ruby applications to interact with
MongoDB databases. You can use the {+driver-short+} to connect to MongoDB and perform
common data operations. This guide shows you how to create an application that uses the
{+driver-short+} to connect to a MongoDB cluster hosted on MongoDB Atlas
and query data in your cluster.

.. tip:: 

   MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your MongoDB
   deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card required) MongoDB Atlas 
   deployment by following the steps in this guide.

If you prefer to use a different driver or programming language to connect to
MongoDB, see our :driver:`list of official drivers <>`.
