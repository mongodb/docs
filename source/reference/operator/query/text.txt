.. query:: $text

   :query:`$text` performs a text search on the content of the fields
   indexed with a :doc:`text index </core/index-text>`. A
   :query:`$text` expression has the following syntax:

   .. versionchanged:: 3.2

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        $text:
          {
            $search: <string>,
            $language: <string>,
            $caseSensitive: <boolean>,
            $diacriticSensitive: <boolean>
          }
      }

   The :query:`$text` operator accepts a text query document with the
   following fields:

   .. |object-behavior| replace:: :ref:`text-query-operator-behavior`
   .. |text-obj| replace:: text search


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``$search``
   
        - string
   
        - A string of terms that MongoDB parses and uses to query the text
          index. MongoDB performs a logical ``OR`` search of the terms unless
          specified as a phrase. See |object-behavior| for more information on
          the field.
          
          
   
      * - ``$language``
   
        - string
   
        - Optional. The language that determines the list of stop words for the search and
          the rules for the stemmer and tokenizer. If not specified, the search
          uses the default language of the index. For supported languages, see
          :ref:`text-search-languages`.
          
          .. include:: /includes/fact-text-search-language-none.rst
          
          
   
      * - ``$caseSensitive``
   
        - boolean
   
        - Optional. A boolean flag to enable or disable case sensitive search. Defaults
          to ``false``; i.e. the search defers to the case insensitivity of the
          :doc:`text </core/index-text>` index.
          
          For more information, see :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`.

      * - ``$diacriticSensitive``
   
        - boolean
   
        - Optional. A boolean flag to enable or disable diacritic sensitive search
          against version 3 :ref:`text <index-feature-text>` indexes. Defaults to
          ``false``; i.e. the search defers to the diacritic insensitivity of
          the ``text`` index.

          Text searches against earlier versions of the ``text`` index are
          inherently diacritic sensitive and cannot be diacritic insensitive.
          As such, the ``$diacriticSensitive`` option has no effect with
          earlier versions of the ``text`` index.
          
          For more information, see :ref:`text-operator-diacritic-sensitivity`.
          
          .. versionadded:: 3.2
          
          
   


   The :query:`$text` operator, by default, does *not* return results
   sorted in terms of the results' scores. For more information on
   sorting by the text search scores, see the
   :ref:`text-operator-text-score` documentation.

.. _text-query-operator-behavior:

Behavior
--------

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A query can specify, at most, one :query:`$text` expression.

- The :query:`$text` query can not appear in :query:`$nor` expressions.

- The :query:`$text` query can not appear in :query:`$elemMatch` query
  expressions or :projection:`$elemMatch` projection expressions.

- To use a :query:`$text` query in an :query:`$or` expression, all
  clauses in the :query:`$or` array must be indexed.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-hint-text-query-restriction.rst

- .. include:: /includes/fact-natural-sort-order-text-query-restriction.rst

  .. |operation| replace:: :query:`$text` expression

- .. include:: /includes/fact-special-indexes-and-text.rst

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-text-search.rst

If using the :query:`$text` operator in aggregation, the following
restrictions also apply.

.. include:: /includes/list-text-search-restrictions-in-agg.rst

.. |text-object| replace:: :query:`$text`
.. |meta-object| replace:: :projection:`$meta` projection operator
.. |sort-object| replace:: :method:`~cursor.sort()` method

``$search`` Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``$search`` field, specify a string of words that the
:query:`text` operator parses and uses to query the :doc:`text index
</core/index-text>`.

The :query:`text` operator treats most punctuation
in the string as delimiters, except a hyphen-minus (``-``) that negates term or
an escaped double quotes ``\"`` that specifies a phrase.

.. _text-operator-phrases:

Phrases
```````

To match on a phrase, as opposed to individual terms, enclose the
phrase in escaped double quotes (``\"``), as in:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "\"ssl certificate\""

If the ``$search`` string includes a phrase and individual terms, text
search will only match the documents that include the phrase.

For example, passed a ``$search`` string:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "\"ssl certificate\" authority key"

The :query:`$text` operator searches for the phrase ``"ssl
certificate"``.

.. _text-operator-term-negation:

Negations
`````````

Prefixing a word with a hyphen-minus (``-``) negates a word:

- The negated word excludes documents that contain the
  negated word from the result set.

- When passed a search string that only contains negated words, text
  search will not match any documents.

- A hyphenated word, such as ``pre-market``, is not a negation. If used
  in a hyphenated word, :query:`$text` operator treats the hyphen-minus
  (``-``) as a delimiter. To negate the word ``market`` in this
  instance, include a space between ``pre`` and ``-market``, i.e.,
  ``pre -market``.

The :query:`$text` operator adds all negations to the query with the
logical ``AND`` operator.

Match Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stop Words
``````````

The :query:`$text` operator ignores language-specific stop words, such
as ``the`` and ``and`` in English.

.. _match-operation-stemmed-words:

Stemmed Words
`````````````

For case insensitive and diacritic insensitive text searches, the
:query:`$text` operator matches on the complete *stemmed* word. So if a
document field contains the word ``blueberry``, a search on the term
``blue`` will not match. However, ``blueberry`` or ``blueberries`` will
match.

.. _case-sensitivity-and-stemming:

Case Sensitive Search and Stemmed Words
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For :ref:`case sensitive <text-operator-case-sensitivity>` search (i.e.
``$caseSensitive: true``), if the suffix stem contains uppercase
letters, the :query:`$text` operator matches on the exact word.

.. _diacritic-sensitivity-and-stemming:

Diacritic Sensitive Search and Stemmed Words
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For :ref:`diacritic sensitive <text-operator-diacritic-sensitivity>`
search (i.e. ``$diacriticSensitive: true``), if the suffix stem
contains the diacritic mark or marks, the :query:`$text` operator
matches on the exact word.

.. _text-operator-case-sensitivity:

Case Insensitivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :query:`$text` operator defaults to the case insensitivity of the
:doc:`text </core/index-text>` index:

- The version 3 :ref:`text index <text-index-case-insensitivity>` is
  case insensitive for Latin characters with or without diacritics and
  characters from non-Latin alphabets, such as the Cyrillic alphabet.
  See :ref:`text <text-index-case-insensitivity>` index for details.

- Earlier versions of the ``text`` index are case insensitive for Latin
  characters without diacritic marks; i.e. for ``[A-z]``.

``$caseSensitive`` Option
`````````````````````````

To support case sensitive search where the ``text`` index is case
insensitive, specify ``$caseSensitive: true``.

Case Sensitive Search Process
`````````````````````````````

When performing a case sensitive search (``$caseSensitive: true``)
where the ``text`` index is case insensitive, the :query:`$text`
operator:

- First searches the ``text`` index for case insensitive and diacritic
  matches.

- Then, to return just the documents that match the case of the search
  terms, the :query:`$text` query operation includes an additional
  stage to filter out the documents that do not match the specified
  case.

For case sensitive search (i.e. ``$caseSensitive: true``), if
the suffix stem contains uppercase letters, the :query:`$text` operator
matches on the exact word.

Specifying ``$caseSensitive: true`` may impact performance.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`match-operation-stemmed-words`

.. _text-operator-diacritic-sensitivity:

Diacritic Insensitivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :query:`$text` operator defaults to the diacritic insensitivity of
the :doc:`text </core/index-text>` index:

- The version 3 :ref:`text index <text-index-diacritic-insensitivity>` is
  diacritic insensitive. That is, the index does not distinguish
  between characters that contain diacritical marks and their
  non-marked counterpart, such as ``é``, ``ê``, and ``e``.

- Earlier versions of the ``text`` index are diacritic sensitive.

``$diacriticSensitive`` Option
``````````````````````````````

To support diacritic sensitive text search against the ``text`` index,
specify ``$diacriticSensitive: true``.

Text searches against earlier versions of the ``text`` index are
inherently diacritic sensitive and cannot be diacritic insensitive.  As
such, the ``$diacriticSensitive`` option for the :query:`$text`
operator has no effect with earlier versions of the ``text`` index.

Diacritic Sensitive Search Process
``````````````````````````````````

To perform a diacritic sensitive text search (``$diacriticSensitive:
true``) against a version 3 ``text`` index, the :query:`$text` operator:

- First searches the ``text`` index, which is diacritic insensitive.

- Then, to return just the documents that match the diacritic marked
  characters of the search terms, the :query:`$text` query operation
  includes an additional stage to filter out the documents that do not
  match.

Specifying ``$diacriticSensitive: true`` may impact performance.

To perform a diacritic sensitive search against an earlier version of
the ``text`` index, the :query:`$text` operator searches the ``text``
index, which is diacritic sensitive.

For diacritic sensitive search, if the suffix stem contains the
diacritic mark or marks, the :query:`$text` operator matches on the
exact word.

Examples
--------

The following examples assume a collection ``articles`` that has a
version 3 :doc:`text </core/index-text>` index on the field ``subject``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.createIndex( { subject: "text" } )

Populate the collection with the following documents:

.. only:: (not latex)

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.articles.insert(
         [
           { _id: 1, subject: "coffee", author: "xyz", views: 50 },
           { _id: 2, subject: "Coffee Shopping", author: "efg", views: 5 },
           { _id: 3, subject: "Baking a cake", author: "abc", views: 90  },
           { _id: 4, subject: "baking", author: "xyz", views: 100 },
           { _id: 5, subject: "Café Con Leche", author: "abc", views: 200 },
           { _id: 6, subject: "Сырники", author: "jkl", views: 80 },
           { _id: 7, subject: "coffee and cream", author: "efg", views: 10 },
           { _id: 8, subject: "Cafe con Leche", author: "xyz", views: 10 }
         ]
      )

.. only:: latex

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.articles.insert(
         [
           { _id: 1, subject: "coffee", author: "xyz", views: 50 },
           { _id: 2, subject: "Coffee Shopping", author: "efg", views: 5 },
           { _id: 3, subject: "Baking a cake", author: "abc", views: 90  },
           { _id: 4, subject: "baking", author: "xyz", views: 100 },
           { _id: 5, subject: "Café Con Leche", author: "abc", views: 200 },
           { _id: 6, subject: "", author: "jkl", views: 80 },
           { _id: 7, subject: "coffee and cream", author: "efg", views: 10 },
           { _id: 8, subject: "Cafe con Leche", author: "xyz", views: 10 }
         ]
      )

Search for a Single Word
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query specifies a ``$search`` string of ``coffee``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "coffee" } } )

This query returns the documents that contain the term ``coffee`` in the
indexed ``subject`` field, or more precisely, the stemmed version of
the word:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 2, "subject" : "Coffee Shopping", "author" : "efg", "views" : 5 }
   { "_id" : 7, "subject" : "coffee and cream", "author" : "efg", "views" : 10 }
   { "_id" : 1, "subject" : "coffee", "author" : "xyz", "views" : 50 }

.. seealso::
   :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`,
   :ref:`match-operation-stemmed-words`

Match Any of the Search Terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the search string is a space-delimited string, :query:`$text`
operator performs a logical ``OR`` search on each term and returns
documents that contains any of the terms.

The following query specifies a ``$search`` string of three terms
delimited by space, ``"bake coffee cake"``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "bake coffee cake" } } )

This query returns documents that contain either ``bake`` **or**
``coffee`` **or** ``cake`` in the indexed ``subject`` field, or more
precisely, the stemmed version of these words:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 2, "subject" : "Coffee Shopping", "author" : "efg", "views" : 5 }
   { "_id" : 7, "subject" : "coffee and cream", "author" : "efg", "views" : 10 }
   { "_id" : 1, "subject" : "coffee", "author" : "xyz", "views" : 50 }
   { "_id" : 3, "subject" : "Baking a cake", "author" : "abc", "views" : 90 }
   { "_id" : 4, "subject" : "baking", "author" : "xyz", "views" : 100 }

.. seealso::
   :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`,
   :ref:`match-operation-stemmed-words`

Search for a Phrase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To match the exact phrase as a single term, escape the quotes.

The following query searches for the phrase ``coffee shop``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "\"coffee shop\"" } } )

This query returns documents that contain the phrase ``coffee shop``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 2, "subject" : "Coffee Shopping", "author" : "efg", "views" : 5 }

.. seealso:: :ref:`text-operator-phrases`

Exclude Documents That Contain a Term
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *negated* term is a term that is prefixed by a minus sign ``-``. If
you negate a term, the :query:`$text` operator will exclude the
documents that contain those terms from the results.

The following example searches for documents that contain the words
``coffee`` but do **not** contain the term ``shop``, or more precisely
the stemmed version of the words:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "coffee -shop" } } )

The query returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 7, "subject" : "coffee and cream", "author" : "efg", "views" : 10 }
   { "_id" : 1, "subject" : "coffee", "author" : "xyz", "views" : 50 }

.. seealso::
   :ref:`text-operator-term-negation`,
   :ref:`match-operation-stemmed-words`

Search a Different Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the optional ``$language`` field in the :query:`$text` expression
to specify a language that determines the list of stop words and the
rules for the stemmer and tokenizer for the search string.

.. include:: /includes/fact-text-search-language-none.rst

The following query specifies ``es``, i.e. Spanish, as the language
that determines the tokenization, stemming, and stop words:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find(
      { $text: { $search: "leche", $language: "es" } }
   )

The query returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 5, "subject" : "Café Con Leche", "author" : "abc", "views" : 200 }
   { "_id" : 8, "subject" : "Cafe con Leche", "author" : "xyz", "views" : 10 }

The :query:`$text` expression can also accept the language by name,
``spanish``. See :ref:`text-search-languages` for the supported
languages.

.. seealso:: :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`

Case and Diacritic Insensitive Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :query:`$text` operator defers to the case and diacritic
insensitivity of the ``text`` index. The version 3 ``text`` index is
diacritic insensitive and expands its case insensitivity to include the
Cyrillic alphabet as well as characters with diacritics. For details,
see :ref:`text Index Case Insensitivity
<text-index-case-insensitivity>` and :ref:`text Index Diacritic
Insensitivity <text-index-diacritic-insensitivity>`.

.. only:: (not latex)

   The following query performs a case and diacritic insensitive text
   search for the terms ``сы́рники`` or ``CAFÉS``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "сы́рники CAFÉS" } } )

   Using the version 3 ``text`` index, the query matches the following
   documents.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id" : 6, "subject" : "Сырники", "author" : "jkl", "views" : 80 }
      { "_id" : 5, "subject" : "Café Con Leche", "author" : "abc", "views" : 200 }
      { "_id" : 8, "subject" : "Cafe con Leche", "author" : "xyz", "views" : 10 }

.. only:: latex

   The following query performs a case and diacritic insensitive text
   search for the term ``CAFÉS``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "CAFÉS" } } )

   Using the version 3 ``text`` index, the query matches the following
   documents.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id" : 5, "subject" : "Café Con Leche", "author" : "abc", "views" : 200 }
      { "_id" : 8, "subject" : "Cafe con Leche", "author" : "xyz", "views" : 10 }

With previous versions of the ``text`` index, the query would not
match any document.

Perform Case Sensitive Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable case sensitive search, specify ``$caseSensitive: true``.
Specifying ``$caseSensitive: true`` may impact performance.

Case Sensitive Search for a Term
````````````````````````````````

The following query performs a case sensitive search for the term
``Coffee``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "Coffee", $caseSensitive: true } } )

The search matches just the document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 2, "subject" : "Coffee Shopping", "author" : "efg", "views" : 5 }

.. seealso::
   :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`,
   :ref:`case-sensitivity-and-stemming`

Case Sensitive Search for a Phrase
``````````````````````````````````

The following query performs a case sensitive search for the phrase
``Café Con Leche``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( {
      $text: { $search: "\"Café Con Leche\"", $caseSensitive: true }
   } )

The search matches just the document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 5, "subject" : "Café Con Leche", "author" : "abc", "views" : 200 }

.. seealso::
   :ref:`case-sensitivity-and-stemming`,
   :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`

Case Sensitivity with Negated Term
``````````````````````````````````

A *negated* term is a term that is prefixed by a minus sign ``-``. If
you negate a term, the :query:`$text` operator will exclude the
documents that contain those terms from the results. You can also
specify case sensitivity for negated terms.

The following example performs a case sensitive search for documents
that contain the word ``Coffee`` but do **not** contain the lower-case
term ``shop``, or more precisely the stemmed version of the words:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "Coffee -shop", $caseSensitive: true } } )

The query matches the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 2, "subject" : "Coffee Shopping", "author" : "efg" }

.. seealso::
   :ref:`case-sensitivity-and-stemming`,
   :ref:`text-operator-term-negation`

Diacritic Sensitive Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable diacritic sensitive search against a version 3 :doc:`text 
</core/index-text>` index, specify ``$diacriticSensitive: true``.
Specifying ``$diacriticSensitive: true`` may impact performance.

Diacritic Sensitive Search for a Term
``````````````````````````````````````

The following query performs a diacritic sensitive text search on the
term ``CAFÉ``, or more precisely the stemmed version of the word:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "CAFÉ", $diacriticSensitive: true } } )

The query only matches the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 5, "subject" : "Café Con Leche", "author" : "abc" }

.. seealso::
   :ref:`diacritic-sensitivity-and-stemming`,
   :ref:`text-operator-diacritic-sensitivity`,
   :ref:`text-operator-case-sensitivity`


Diacritic Sensitivity with Negated Term
```````````````````````````````````````

The ``$diacriticSensitive`` option applies also to negated terms. A
negated term is a term that is prefixed by a minus sign ``-``. If you
negate a term, the :query:`$text` operator will exclude the documents that
contain those terms from the results.

The following query performs a diacritic sensitive text search for
document that contains the term ``leches`` but not the term ``cafés``,
or more precisely the stemmed version of the words:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find(
     { $text: { $search: "leches -cafés", $diacriticSensitive: true } }
   )

The query matches the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 8, "subject" : "Cafe con Leche", "author" : "xyz" }

.. _ex-sort-limit-two:

Return Top 2 Matching Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :method:`~cursor.limit()` method in conjunction with a
:method:`~cursor.sort()` to return the top ``n`` matching documents.

The following query searches for the term ``coffee`` and sorts the
results by the descending score, limiting the results to the top two
matching documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find(
      { $text: { $search: "coffee" } },
      { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
   ).sort( { score: { $meta: "textScore" } } ).limit(2)

The following query searches for documents where the ``author`` equals
``"xyz"`` and the indexed field ``subject`` contains the terms
``coffee`` or ``bake``. The operation also specifies a sort order of
ascending ``date``, then descending text search score:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find(
      { author: "xyz", $text: { $search: "coffee bake" } },
      { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
   ).sort( { date: 1, score: { $meta: "textScore" } } )
