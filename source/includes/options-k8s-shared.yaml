type: string

description: |
  *New in MongoDB version 4.2.*

  Prevents a MongoDB server running with |tls| from accepting incoming connections 
  that use a specific protocol or protocols. To specify multiple protocols, enter 
  a comma separated list of protocols. For example, ``TLS1_0,TLS1_1``.
  
  This setting recognizes the following protocols: ``TLS1_0``, ``TLS1_1``, ``TLS1_2``, 
  and starting in MongoDB 4.0.4 (and 3.6.9), ``TLS1_3``. If you specify an unrecognized protocol, the 
  server won't start.

  On macOS, you can't disable ``TLS1_1`` and enable both ``TLS1_0`` and ``TLS1_2``. 
  You must disable at least ``TLS1_0`` or ``TLS1_2`` also. For example, ``TLS1_0,TLS1_1`` 
  disables ``TLS1_2`` on macOS. 
  
  The list of protocols that you disable replaces the default list of disabled protocols.

  Starting in MongoDB version 4.0, MongoDB disables the use of |tls| 1.0 if |tls| 1.1+ 
  is available on the system. To enable the disabled |tls| 1.0, specify ``none`` as the value for  
  :setting:`spec.additionalMongodConfig.net.tls.disabledProtocols`. 
  To learn more about this setting, see :manual:`Disable TLS 1.0 </release-notes/4.0/#disable-tls-1.0>`.

  Members of replica sets and sharded clusters must speak at least one protocol in common.

  The |k8s-op-short| accepts the following values:

  - ``["X509"]``: X.509 internal cluster authentication is enabled.

  Replica set resources don't need this parameter. Use
  :setting:`spec.connectivity.replicaSetHorizons` instead.

  .. note::

     If you add this parameter to a |tls|\-enabled resource, |k8s|
     displays an error when the resource reaches the ``Pending`` state.
     This error displays: ``Please manually remove the |csr| in order
     to proceed.`` To remedy this issue:

     1. Remove any existing |csr|\s so that |k8s| can generate new
        |csr|\s. To learn how to delete a resource, see the
        :k8sdocs:`deleting resources
        </reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#deleting-resources>` in the
        |k8s| documentation.

     2. Approve the |csr|\s after |k8s| generates them.
