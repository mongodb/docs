This page describes how to restore specific archived data using the :pipeline:`$merge`
pipeline stage. This approach allows you execute a more granular restore based on specific
criteria. If you need to restore a complete cluster, see :ref:`oa-config-backup` for more
details. 

.. note:: 

   Ensure that your {+cluster+} is adequately provisioned for the amount of data you want
   to restore from your archive. Otherwise, you risk running out of space during or after the
   restoration. Contact :doc:`Support </support>` for additional technical guidance on
   setting up the size of the oplog or for troubleshooting any space issues on your
   |service| {+cluster+}.

This approach is not recommended for large datasets (around 1TB of data) with a large
number of partitions. 

Procedure
