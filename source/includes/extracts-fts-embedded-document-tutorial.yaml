  The following queries search the embedded documents in the ``schools``
  collection. The queries use the following pipeline stages:

  - :pipeline:`$search` to search the collection.
  - :pipeline:`$project` to include the ``_id`` field to include and
    exclude fields from the collection, and add a field 
    named ``score`` in the results. For queries that enable
    :ref:`highlighting <highlight-ref>`, the :pipeline:`$project` stage
    also adds a new field called ``highlights``, which contains the
    highlighting information.

  The following query searches at the ``teachers`` path for teachers with 
  the first name ``John`` and specifies a preference for teachers 
  with the last name ``Smith``. It also enables :ref:`highlighting
  <highlight-ref>` on the ``last`` name field.

  .. note:: 

     The :guilabel:`Search Tester` doesn't support :ref:`highlighting
     <highlight-ref>`. So, use {+mongosh+} or a MongoDB driver to see
     :ref:`highlighting <highlight-ref>` information in the results.

  the ``classes`` array of the documents for the ``teachers``.
