  .. important:: Ensure that you add the IP address you will use to
     access MongoDB as the ``admin`` user.

  Enter the desired IP address or |cidr|\-notated range of addresses:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 40 60

     * - Entry

       - Grants

     * - An IP address

       - Access from that address.

     * - A |cidr|\-notated range of IP addresses

       - Access from the designated range of addresses.

         For peer |vpc| connections, you can specify the |cidr| block
         (or a subset) or the associated Security Group.

         The Internet provides online tools for converting a range of
         IP addresses to |cidr|, such as
         `<http://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr>`_.

         .. important::

            Adding the |cidr| `0.0.0.0/0` allows access from anywhere.
            Ensure that strong credentials (username and password) are
            used for all database users when allowing access from
            anywhere.

     * - Security Group ID (AWS Only)

       - Access via Security Group membership from a peered VPC.

         .. important::

            |service| does not support security group whitelisting in
            projects with VPC peering connections in multiple regions.

title: "(Optional) Set the whitelist as temporary."
level: 4
ref: set-temporary-ip
content: |

  Check the :guilabel:`Save as temporary whitelist` option to
  specify a length of time that the IP address will be whitelisted,
  after which |service| will remove the address from the whitelist. You
  can select one of the following time periods for the address to be
  whitelisted:

  - 6 hours

  - 1 day

  - 1 week

  In the :guilabel:`IP Whitelist` view, temporary whitelist entries
  display the time remaining until the address will expire. Once the IP
  address expires and is deleted, any client or application attempting
  to connect to the cluster from the address will no longer be able to
  access the cluster.

  .. note::

     You cannot set |aws| security groups as temporary whitelist
     entries.
