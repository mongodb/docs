    connection dialog:

    .. figure:: /images/compass/new-connection-form.png

    The following information is requested:

    a. Hostname: The hostname of the machine where :binary:`~bin.mongod` is running.
    b. Port: The port of the machine where :binary:`~bin.mongod` is running.
    c. Authentication: The authentication mechanism to connect to the target
       host. Supported authentication mechanisms include:

       - MongoDB-CR (*Removed in MongoDB 4.0*)
       - SCRAM-SHA-1
       - SCRAM-SHA-256 (*Added in MongoDB 4.0*)
       - Kerberos
       - LDAP

       You cannot specify MongoDB-CR when connecting to MongoDB 4.0 deployments.

    d. SSL: Whether or not Compass should connect to the target host with TLS/SSL.
       Several TLS/SSL options are available:

       - Unvalidated: If this option is used, the server cerficiate is not
         validated and no client certificate will be provided. The server must be
         set up to allow connections without valid certificates.
       - Server Validation: The server certificate will be validated, but no
         client certificate will be provided. The server must be set up to allow
         connections without valid certificates.
       - Server and Client Validation: The server certificate will be validated
         and a client certificate must be provided.

    e. Favorite Name (Optional): A nickname for the connection. Previous
       connections are saved in Compass; a descriptive name simplifies
       re-establishing the connection on future runs.
