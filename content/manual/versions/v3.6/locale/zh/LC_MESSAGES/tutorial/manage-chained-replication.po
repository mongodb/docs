"Starting in version 2.0, MongoDB supports chained replication. A chained "
"replication occurs when a :term:`secondary` member replicates from "
"another secondary member instead of from the :term:`primary`. This might "
"be the case, for example, if a secondary selects its replication target "
"based on ping time and if the closest member is another secondary."

"Chained replication can reduce load on the primary. But chained "
"replication can also result in increased replication lag, depending on "
"the topology of the network."

":dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` to specify that a secondary replicates from "
