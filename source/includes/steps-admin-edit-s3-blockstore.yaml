         the |s3ss|.


     * - Region Override
       - Conditional
       - yes
       - Type the region where your |s3| bucket resides.

         Use this field only if your |s3| store's 
         **S3 Endpoint** doesn't support region scoping. Don't provide 
         a value for this field with |aws| S3 buckets.


     * - S3 Endpoint
       - Required
       - yes
       - Type the |url| for this |s3| bucket.


     * - S3 Max Connections
       - Required
       - yes
       - Type a positive integer indicating the maximum number of
         connections to this |s3| bucket.


     * - Path Style Access
       - Optional
       - yes
       - Click if you want your |s3| bucket
         to use a path-style |url| endpoint
         (``s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>``) instead of a
         virtual-host-style |url| endpoint
         (``<bucket>.s3.amazonaws.com``).

         To review the |s3| bucket
         |url| conventions, see the
         :aws:`AWS S3 documentation </AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro>`


     * - Server Side Encryption
       - Optional
       - yes
       - Click to enable :aws:`server-side encryption

         Clear to disable server-side encryption.


     * - S3 Authorization Mode
       - Required
       - yes
       - Select the method used to authorize access to the |s3| bucket
         specified in :guilabel:`S3 Bucket Name`.

         .. list-table::
            :widths: 20 80
            :stub-columns: 1

            * - Keys
              - |mms| uses :guilabel:`AWS Access Key` and
                :guilabel:`AWS Secret Key` to authorize access to your
                |s3| bucket.
            * - IAM Role
              - |mms| uses an |aws| |iam| role to authorize access to
                your |s3| bucket. :guilabel:`AWS Access Key` and
                :guilabel:`AWS Secret Key` fields are ignored.


     * - Keys with Custom CA Bundle
       - Conditional
       - yes
       - Click :guilabel:`Choose file` to add a custom |certauth|
         chain. This chain can validate against a self-signed
         certificate on the |s3| bucket.


     * - AWS Access Key
       - Conditional
       - yes
       - Type your |aws| Access Key ID.

         |mms| displays this field when you set
         :guilabel:`S3 Authorization Mode` to :guilabel:`Keys`.


     * - AWS Secret Key
       - Conditional
       - yes
       - Type your |aws| Secret Access Key.

         |mms| displays this field when you set
         :guilabel:`S3 Authorization Mode` to :guilabel:`Keys`.

         |mms| doesn't display the existing Secret Access Key.
       

     * - <hostname>:<port>
       - Required
       - yes
       - Type in one or more hosts that comprise the |s3| Snapshot
         Store metadata database in the ``<hostname:port>`` format.

         If the |s3ss| metadata database is a Replica
         Set or Sharded Cluster, type a comma-separated list of
         |mongod| instances (for a Replica Set) or |mongos|
         instances (for a Sharded Cluster).

         For example:

         .. code-block:: ini

            host1.example.com:27017,host2.example.com:27017,host2.example.com:27018

         - If the |s3ss| metadata database is a
           standalone MongoDB instance, type the ``hostname:port`` of
           the instance.
       

     * - MongoDB Auth Username
       - Optional
       - yes
       - If you set this value:

         .. include:: /includes/tabsets/storage-settings-username.rst

     * - MongoDB Auth Password
       - Optional
       - yes
       - If you set this value:

         .. include:: /includes/tabsets/storage-settings-password.rst

         |onprem| doesn't display the existing
         :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`.

         .. include:: /includes/warning-plaintext-password.rst

         .. note::

            |onprem| doesn't display the existing
            :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`.
       

     * - Encrypted Credentials
       - Optional
       - yes
       - Select if the credentials for the database were encrypted
         using the
         :doc:`credentialstool </tutorial/encrypt-user-credentials>`.
         The credentials include the Username, Password, |aws| Access
         Key ID and |aws| Secret Key.


     * - Use TLS/SSL
       - Optional
       - yes
       - Select if the blockstore database only accepts connection
         encrypted using |tls|.

         Beyond this checkbox, to connect this |s3ss|
         using |tls|, you must enable
         :manual:`TLS on the S3 blockstore database </tutorial/configure-ssl>`.


     * - Connection Options
       - Optional
       - yes
       - Type any additional :manual:`configuration file options
         </reference/configuration-options>` for the MongoDB instance.
         This field supports unescaped values only.

         For proper syntax, see :manual:`Connection String URI
         Format </reference/connection-string>` in the MongoDB manual.


     * - Assignment Labels
       - Optional
       - yes
       - Type a comma-separated list of labels to assign the
         S3 blockstores to specific projects.


     * - Load Factor
       - Optional
       - yes
       - Type any positive integer that expresses how much backup work
         you want this snapshot store to perform compared to another
         snapshot store.

         Backup work includes running backups, restoring snapshots or
         :term:`grooming <groom>` blockstores. The ratio of backup work
         assigned to a single snapshot store is called its *Load
         Factor*.         

         :gold:`IMPORTANT:` If you have only one snapshot store,
         :guilabel:`Load Factor` represents the number of concurrent 
         backup work processes the snapshot store performs at a time.
         To avoid performance costs associated with running multiple 
         concurrent processes when you have one snapshot store, 
         omit this setting to assign your snapshot store the 
         default :guilabel:`Load Factor` of ``1``. 

         When you have multiple snapshot stores, the default :guilabel:`Load Factor` 
         of ``1`` assigns each snapshot store the same amount of work. If a snapshot 
         store's :guilabel:`Load Factor` is set to ``0``, 
         it performs no backup work at all. 
         
         If a snapshot store's :guilabel:`Load Factor` is changed while 
         backup work is in progress, all jobs or tasks running on that snapshot store
         are allowed to finish. All future backup work is then re-
         distributed among the remaining snapshot stores that have a
         :guilabel:`Load Factor` of ``1`` or greater and 
         :guilabel:`Assignment Enabled` selected. 

         As a snapshot store's :guilabel:`Load Factor` increases, it
         performs more backup work compared to another snapshot store.
         For example, if the :guilabel:`Load Factor` of snapshot store ``A`` is set
         to ``2`` and the :guilabel:`Load Factor` of snapshot store
         ``B`` is set to ``1``, then ``A`` performs two times the backup
         work of ``B``.

         Snapshot stores with greater computer or storage performance
         should be given a greater :guilabel:`Load Factor`. 
         For example, consider a five-shard sharded cluster with the
         following backup storage configuration:

         - File system store (``F``) manages the backup work for
           one shard in the cluster. ``F`` is running on a single
           two-core physical server.

         - Blockstore (``B``) manages the backup work for four
           shards in the cluster. ``B`` is running as a four-node
           sharded cluster on four physical servers with two cores
           on each server.

         In this example, ``B`` has four times the capability of
         ``F``. You should set the :guilabel:`Load Factor`\s of ``B`` to ``4`` and ``F`` to ``1``. 
         For every ``1`` backup task ``F`` performs, ``B`` performs ``4``.

         For more examples comparing the storage capabilities of 
         different backup configurations, see:  

         - A file system store with 16-cores and 128 GB of RAM can
           back up more databases in less time than a file system
           store with only 2 cores and 8 GB of RAM.

         - A blockstore backed by a 10-node sharded cluster can back
           up more databases and groom more databases than a
           blockstore backed by a single replica set.

         :guilabel:`Load Factor` can be set to ``0``. When one snapshot
         store's :guilabel:`Load Factor` is set to ``0``, it performs
         no backup work at all. If a snapshot store's
         :guilabel:`Load Factor` is changed while backup work is in
         progress, all jobs or tasks running on that snapshot store
         are allowed to finish. All future backup work then is re-
         distributed among the remaining snapshot stores with a
         :guilabel:`Load Factor` of ``1`` or greater and have
         :guilabel:`Assignment Enabled` selected.
       

     * - Write Concern
       - Required
       - yes
       - Select your preferred
         :manual:`Write Concern</core/write-concern/>`:

  If you change any connection string values or the Write Concern,
  restart all the |onprem| instances including those running Backup
  Daemons.

  .. warning::

     Modifying the connection string values or the Write Concern for an
     existing blockstore requires all |onprem| components, including
     those only running the Backup Daemon, to be restarted to apply
     those changes. Connection parameters include:

     - :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>`
     - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Username`
     - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`
     - :guilabel:`Encrypted Credentials`
     - :guilabel:`Use TLS/SSL`
     - :guilabel:`Connection Options`
     - :guilabel:`Write Concern`

     If you change to another blockstore host, the data on the
     existing blockstore is not copied automatically to the other
     blockstore.
