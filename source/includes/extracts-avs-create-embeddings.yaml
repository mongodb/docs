  In this section, you define a function to generate vector embeddings
  by using an embedding model. Select a tab based on whether you want to
  use an open-source embedding model or a proprietary model such as OpenAI. 

  .. note::

     Open-source embedding models are free to use and can be loaded
     locally from your application. Proprietary models 
     require an |api| key to access the models.

  In this section, you define a function to generate vector embeddings
  by using an embedding model. Select a tab based on whether you want 
  to use an open-source embedding model from Nomic or a proprietary model 
  from OpenAI. 
  
  The open-source example also includes a
  function to convert your embeddings to |bson| ``binData`` vectors
  for :ref:`efficient processing <avs-bindata-vector-subtype>`. 
  Only certain embedding models support 
  byte vector outputs. For embedding models that don't, 
  such as models from OpenAI, enable automatic quantization
  when creating the {+avs+} index.
