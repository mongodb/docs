Custom HTTPS Endpoint Configuration
-----------------------------------

Define the configurations for all of your app's :ref:`custom HTTPS
endpoints <https-endpoints>` as an array in ``https_endpoints/config.json``.

.. code-block:: json
   
   [
     {
       "route": "<Endpoint Route Name>",
       "http_method": "<HTTP method>",
       "function_name": "<Endpoint function name",
       "validation_method": "<Authorization scheme>",
       "secret_name": "<Validation Secret Name>",
       "respond_result": <boolean>,
       "fetch_custom_user_data": <boolean>,
       "create_user_on_auth": <boolean>,
       "disabled": <boolean>
     }
   ]

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30

   * - Field
     - Description
    
   * - | ``route``
       | ``string``
     
     - The endpoint :ref:`route <endpoint-route>`.
    
   * - | ``http_method``
       | ``string``
     
     - The type of :mdn:`HTTP method <Web/HTTP/Methods>` that the
       endpoint handles. Specify ``*`` to handle all methods with a
       single endpoint.

       One of:

       - ``"GET"``
       - ``"POST"``
       - ``"PUT"``
       - ``"PATCH"``
       - ``"DELETE"``
       - ``"DELETE"``
       - ``"*"``
    
   * - | ``function_name``
       | ``string``
     
     - The name of the :ref:`function <appconfig-functions>` associated
       with the endpoint. The function should use the :ref:`endpoint
       function signature <endpoint-function>`.
    
   * - | ``validation_method``
       | ``string``
     
     - The :ref:`endpoint authorization scheme <endpoint-authorization>`
       used to validate incoming requests.
       
       One of:

       - ``"SECRET_AS_QUERY_PARAM"``
       - ``"VERIFY_PAYLOAD"``
       - ``"NO_VALIDATION"``
   
   * - | ``secret_name``
       | ``string``
     
     - The name of a :ref:`secret <app-secret>` that contains a string.
       If ``validation_method`` is set to ``SECRET_AS_QUERY_PARAM`` or
       ``VERIFY_PAYLOAD``, this secret is used to authorize requests.
   
   * - | ``respond_result``
       | ``boolean``
     
     - If ``true``, the endpoint returns a customizable HTTP response to
       the client. You configure the response by calling the methods on
       the :ref:`Response <endpoint-response-object>` object. If you do
       not configure the response, the endpoint returns a ``200 - Ok``
       response with the value returned from the endpont function as the
       request body.

       If ``false``, requests return a ``204 - No Content`` response
       with no data in the body.
    
   * - | ``fetch_custom_user_data``
       | ``boolean``
     
     - If ``true``, the authenticated user's :ref:`custom user data
       <custom-user-data>` document is available via
       ``context.user.custom_data``.

       If ``false``, the user's custom data is not queried and
       ``context.user.custom_data`` is an empty object.
    
   * - | ``create_user_on_auth``
       | ``boolean``
     
     - If ``true``, your app automatically creates a new user
       if the provided user credentials authenticate successfully but
       aren't associated with an existing user.
       
       This setting is useful for apps that integrate with external
       authentication system through the Custom JWT authentication
       provider. If a request includes a valid JWT from the external system
       that doesn't correspond to a registered user, this creates a new
       user with the JWT as an identity.
   
   * - | ``disabled``
       | ``boolean``
     
     - Enables (``false``) or disables (``true``) the endpoint.

Data API Configuration
----------------------

Define the configuration for your app's generated :ref:`Data API
endpoints <data-api-endpoints>` in ``https_endpoints/data_api_config.json``.

.. code-block:: json
   
   {
     "disabled": <boolean>,
     "versions": ["v1"],
     "return_type": "EJSON" | "JSON",
     "create_user_on_auth": <boolean>,
     "run_as_system": <boolean>,
     "run_as_user_id": "<User Account ID>",
     "run_as_user_id_script_source": "<Function Source Code>"
   }

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30

   * - Field
     - Description
    
   * - | ``disabled``
       | ``boolean``
     
     - If ``false``, the Data API is not enabled. Generated endpoints
       will not handle or respond to requests.
    
   * - | ``versions``
       | ``string[]``
     
     - A list of Data API versions that your app supports. The list may
       include a subset of all possible versions but must list the
       versions in ascending order. You cannot enable a version other
       than the most recent version but any previously enabled versions
       listed here will continue to work.

       Available Versions:

       - ``"v1"``
    
   * - | ``return_type``
       | ``string``
     
     - The data format to use for data returned by endpoints in HTTPS
       response bodies.
       
       One of:
       
       - ``"EJSON"``
       - ``"JSON"``
       
   * - | ``create_user_on_auth``
       | ``boolean``
     
     - If ``true``, your app automatically creates a new user
       if the provided user credentials authenticate successfully but
       aren't associated with an existing user.
       
       This setting is useful for apps that integrate with external
       authentication system through the Custom JWT authentication
       provider. If a request includes a valid JWT from the external system
       that doesn't correspond to a registered user, this creates a new
       user with the JWT as an identity.
   
   * - | ``run_as_user_id``
       | ``string``
     - An application user's account ID. If defined, endpoints will
       always run as the specified user.
       
       Cannot be used with ``run_as_user_id_script_source``.
   
   * - | ``run_as_user_id_script_source``
       | ``string``
     - Stringified source code for a :ref:`function <functions>` that
       returns an application user's account ID. If defined, endpoints
       execute the function on every request and run as the user with
       the ID returned from the function.
       
       Cannot be used with ``run_as_user_id``.
