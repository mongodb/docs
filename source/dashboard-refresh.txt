|charts| automatically refreshes chart data once it becomes out of
date with the backing data source. You can also manually refresh
dashboard data at any time.

Configure Auto Refresh Settings
-------------------------------

Charts on a dashboard automatically refresh once their data becomes out
of date. You can specify how stale your charts' data can be before it is
refreshed. This is known as your staleness tolerance. The default
behavior is to refresh when data is one hour stale.

To configure auto-refresh settings for a dashboard:

1. Select a dashboard from the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page.

#. Click :guilabel:`Settings` at the top of the dashboard.

#. Select your data staleness tolerance from the dropdown.
   |charts-short| supports staleness tolerances between 1 minute and 30
   days.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

Manually Refresh Data
---------------------

You can manually refresh an entire dashboard or individual charts to
render your charts with the latest data. In a manual refresh, |charts|
reloads data even if the current data is within your specified staleness
tolerance.

|charts| users of all :ref:`permission levels <dashboard-permissions>`
can refresh dashboard data.

Manually Refresh an Entire Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manually refresh an entire dashboard to requery all of the data sources
backing your charts and render your charts with the latest data.

To manually refresh dashboard data:

1. Select a dashboard from the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page.

#. Click the arrow next to the :guilabel:`Settings` button.

#. Click :guilabel:`Force Refresh`.

Manually Refresh a Single Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manually refresh a single chart to only requery the data source for that
chart and render that chart with the latest data.

To manually refresh a single chart:

1. Select a dashboard from the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page.

#. Click the arrow next to the :guilabel:`Settings` button.

#. Click :guilabel:`Force Refresh`.

Refresh Behavior
----------------

- When |charts-short| refreshes dashboard data, only charts with data
  older than your specified staleness tolerance are refreshed.
  |charts-short| does not refresh the entire dashboard at once.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-auto-refresh-persistence.rst

- Hover over the timer at the bottom of the chart to view more
  information.

  What you see depends on where you view the chart and if the last
  refresh failed:

     :header-rows: 1

     * - Authenticated Dashboard

         - The error code that describes why the refresh failed, if
           applicable. 
         - Time since the last refresh occurred.
         - Time until the next automatic refresh occurs.

     * - Dashboard Accessed with a Public Link

         - Time since the last refresh occurred.
         - Time until the next automatic refresh occurs.
  
     * - Embedded using an iframe or the SDK
       - 
         - The :ref:`embedding error code <embedded-errors>` that
           describes why the refresh failed, if applicable.
         - If the chart is configured to automatically refresh:
           - Time since the last refresh occurred.
           - Time until the next automatic refresh occurs.

Caching Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When |charts| loads charts on a dashboard, it does not consistently
query the data source for each chart. Instead, |charts| queries the
data sources when the dashboard first loads, and that data is cached
on both the client and server.

.. note::

   The data stored in the cache is encrypted with a key specific to
   your |charts| tenant.

- When a dashboard refreshes automatically:

  - If a chart's data is within the staleness tolerance period,
    |charts-short| doesn't refresh the chart's data.

  - If a chart's data is outside of the staleness tolerance period, 
    |charts-short| returns the latest data from the server cache. If the
    server cache contains stale data, |charts-short| queries the data 
    source for the latest data, refreshes the chart, and updates the 
    data cached on both the client and server.

    .. note::

       If your chart is embedded using
       :ref:`Realm Authentication <stitch-sdk-tutorial>` and
       :guilabel:`Fetch data using Realm App` is enabled in your
       :ref:`Authentication Provider Settings
       <configure-auth-providers>`, your chart does not load data from
       the server cache. Your ``maxDataAge`` embedding parameter still
       dictates how often the chart refreshes, but the data source is
       always queried on each render.
    
- When you manually refresh an entire dashboard, |charts-short| updates
  all chart data by querying the data source for the latest data even if
  the chart data is within the specified staleness tolerance period.

Refresh Failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an automatic or manual refresh fails:

- |charts| displays the most recently rendered chart, including all of
  the chart's interactive elements.

- If |charts| has never successfully rendered the chart, the following
  message is displayed: ``Unable to load data``.

- |charts| displays the following error message at the bottom of the 
  chart: ``Last refresh failed``.

- If you're viewing the chart on an Authenticated Dashboard, 
  click the :guilabel:`failed` link in the error message to view
  additional error details.

  .. note::

     This link is not available when you view charts on a dashboard 
     from a public link or embedded using an iframe or the SDK.

- The error message includes a :guilabel:`Refresh` link if the chart 
  is rendered on an authenticated dashboard or embedded using an 
  iframe or the SDK. Click the link to manually refresh the chart.
