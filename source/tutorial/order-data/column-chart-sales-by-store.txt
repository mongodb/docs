Purpose
-------

Looking at the data fields available in the schema, some of the most
valuable information you can relay revolves around revenue. You may
want to know how various stores are performing, specifically if there
are any stores significantly under or overperforming compared to
others.

A column chart works well for this type of visualization because you can
easily compare individual store revenue based on the size of each
column.

Next Steps
----------

Now that we have a visualization showing a high-level overview of store
revenue, one might wonder which type of item each store is selling the
most of. The following section of the tutorial illustrates how to build
a :ref:`donut chart <order-data-donut-chart>` to analyze the tag names
of items being sold.
