":binary:`~bin.mongoreplay` is a traffic capture and replay tool for "
"MongoDB that you can use to inspect and record commands sent to a MongoDB"

":binary:`~bin.mongoreplay` can help you preview how your MongoDB "

":binary:`~bin.mongoreplay` can also help reproduce and investigate an "
"issue by recording and replaying the operations that trigger the issue. "
"Finally, :binary:`~bin.mongoreplay` serves as a more flexible version of "
"the legacy ``mongosniff`` tool to help you investigate database activity."
