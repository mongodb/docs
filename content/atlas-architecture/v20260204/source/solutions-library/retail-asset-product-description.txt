Solution Overview
-----------------

In this solution, you learn how to build a generative AI-powered
architecture that processes images using Together AI vision models,
generating accurate and compelling descriptions of an image. MongoDB
Atlas serves as the operational data layer, leveraging its flexible data
model to scale as you add new descriptions and ensuring
efficient data management and scalability.

This solution proves particularly valuable in the retail industry. The
process of onboarding a new product to a retailer's catalog can be
time-consuming, especially when you craft product descriptions in
multiple languages and for different demographics. This solution helps
streamline that workflow by automating the initial content creation
through `generative AI
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai>`__,
providing retailers with a solid foundation for each product
description, ultimately speeding up the time to market and improving
consistency across their catalog UX writing.

The Importance of a Good Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Business Dasher
<https://www.businessdasher.com/importance-of-product-description/?utm_source=chatgpt.com>`__ 
states that "70% of people leave a product page when the
product description is poor or incomplete." 

Product descriptions play a crucial role in the customer's journey.
Shoppers rely on them to make buying decisions. When descriptions are
weak or missing, businesses risk losing potential revenue and leaving
customers frustrated.

A great description enhances user engagement and satisfaction as "87% of
online shoppers consider product descriptions to be crucial when making
a buying decision," according to `Business Dasher
<https://www.businessdasher.com/importance-of-product-description/?utm_source=chatgpt.com>`__.
On the other hand, inaccurate descriptions can result in revenue loss
and trust decline with your customer base as "40% of consumers have
returned online purchases due to poor product content," according to 
`AX Semantics 
<https://www.ax-semantics.com/en/blog/product-descriptions>`__.

Traditional Product Description Challenges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writing high-quality descriptions involves numerous details and careful
considerations. Some challenges include:

- **Crafting compelling descriptions:** A well-written product
  description addresses their target's needs and desires while
  maintaining a consistent tone that aligns with the business's UX
  writing strategy and brand identity.

- **SEO optimization:** Creating SEO-optimized product descriptions to
  drive organic traffic and improve search engine rankings.

- **Multilingual complexity:** Increased complexity for retailers with 
  multilingual portals or multiple operating geographies.
  
- **Content approval delays:** Even after you write a description, often
  a writing approval process still needs to happen, delaying the time to
  market.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

This architecture has three key components: 

- `MongoDB Atlas
  <https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database>`__: A 
  general-purpose data platform that manages your data in the cloud. The 
  :ref:`MongoDB document model <manual-data-modeling-intro>` allows 
  products to scale easily by adding more descriptions (i.e. for translations 
  in multiple languages) without introducing complexity.

- **Object Storage:** An effective system for product image file storage 
  and retrieval. You can build this with Google Cloud storage, Azure Blob 
  Storage or AWS S3. 

- `Together AI <https://www.together.ai/>`__: Offers various generative
  AI services, making it easy to run or fine-tune leading open source
  models with only a few lines of code. This solution uses their
  available `vision LLMs <https://www.together.ai/models>`__ to generate
  the product descriptions.

The following diagram displays this solution's architecture:

   :figwidth: 1200px
   :alt: Product description architecture diagram
   
   Figure 1. Product description generative AI architecture

This architecture has the following data flow:

**1. Product Ingestion**

The solution starts on the left side of the diagram with the *User/Event*
label. A laptop icon represents the Product Description Generator
system. First, you receive a new product, which you add manually or
in bulk through an automated event. 

**2. Request Description**

You can then generate the descriptions by sending a *query* to
Together AI's endpoint, utilizing their vision models that combine
computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to process and
understand images alongside text. The request includes the image URL,
the desired description length, the vision model utilized, and the
languages for the description. 

**3. Generate Description**

Together AI uses its Llama3 vision models to scan the image, generate 
a description that matches the specified requirements, and return the 
*product description* to the application.

**4. Store Description**

Finally, you upsert the product along with its description inside the
catalog on MongoDB, ensuring real-time availability across all
connected systems.

To illustrate the scalability of this architecture, consider the diagram
below. By integrating :ref:`MongoDB Change Streams <changeStreams>`, it 
allows real-time updates on any application listening to the catalog. For
example, the e-commerce portal, a social media platform, and any other
touchpoints.

Build the Solution
------------------

This solution uses this `GitHub repository 
<https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/description-generator/>`__. 

The repository's ``README`` describes the following procedure in more detail.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Replicate the demo database

      Provision a cluster within your `Atlas account
      <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register>`__ and populate your demo 
      database using the provided data dump and a single :binary:`mongorestore` 
      command.

   .. step:: Retrieve MongoDB Atlas connection string

      Navigate to your cluster and click on *Connect*. Copy the
      connection string provided and save it for your ``.env`` file.

   .. step:: Create your Together AI account

      Sign in to `Together AI <https://www.together.ai/>`__. Navigate to
      your account and retrieve your user key, which you can find by going to 
      your *Profile*, then going to *Settings* and selecting *API Keys*. Save
      this key, as you need it in your ``.env`` file.

   .. step:: Create your object storage

      Create a new bucket in your AWS account and generate an IAM user
      with programmatic access. Save the access key and secret key for
      your ``.env`` file.

   .. step:: Configure your application frontend

      Obtain the demo code by cloning the GitHub repository to your
      local machine, configure the environment variables, and install the
      dependencies. Finally, run the app locally at
      http://localhost:3003.
