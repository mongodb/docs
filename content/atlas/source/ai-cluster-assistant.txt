The {+cluster-ai-assist+} is an AI-powered helper embedded in the {+atlas-ui+}. 
You can use it while creating a cluster or editing a cluster's configuration to
answers natural-language questions about cluster configuration. The
{+cluster-ai-assist+} can then recommend settings based on your workload and
needs and apply those settings directly to your cluster.

Enable AI Features

Examples
--------

The following scenarios show some ways you can use the {+cluster-ai-assist+}
while creating or editing a cluster in {+service+}.

Create a Cluster with the {+cluster-ai-assist+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Describe your use case and needs and ask the {+cluster-ai-assist+} to
suggest what cluster configurations could be best suited for you.

For example, if you are developing an application, you can tell the
{+cluster-ai-assist+} the purpose of your application and the expected amount
of users.

.. io-code-block::
    :copyable: true

    .. input::

       I’m setting up a development cluster for a restaurant rating app with 
       100 users in NYC. What’s the best cluster configuration?

    .. output::
       :visible: false

       For a small development app with ~100 users, cost-effectiveness and
       reliability are key. I recommend starting with an M10 cluster on AWS in 
       US_EAST_1 (N. Virginia). This tier supports your use case with enough 
       resources for development and light testing, while keeping costs 
       controlled. Avoid free (M0) since you already have one and FLEX is 
       unnecessary for your scale.

       I'll suggest a configuration based on these requirements. Quick 
       questions to further optimize:

       - Do you expect your dataset to grow beyond 10GB during development?
       - Any other environments needed, like staging or test?
       - Will more developers or services connect to this cluster soon?

       Suggesting the config now.

After the {+cluster-ai-assist+} suggests a configuration, you can accept and
save it or continue discussing your needs until you reach a configuration you
are satisfied with.

You can also tell the {+cluster-ai-assist+} the size of data you're expecting
to need support for and the where your project is based.

.. io-code-block::
    :copyable: true

    .. input::

       I’m looking to migrate an existing project to Atlas. We currently 
       have 100GB of data that we need to move over. The project is currently 
       deployed in Europe and we want to maintain that. How should I configure 
       my cluster? 

    .. output::
       :visible: false

       For migrating a 100GB project to Atlas in Europe, I recommend the following:

       - Use AWS as your cloud provider (most commonly used, but let me know if
         you prefer GCP or Azure).
       - Select the region EU_WEST_1 (Ireland) to host your data in Europe.
       - Choose at least an M40 instance (this tier is recommended for 
	      migrating and running production workloads with 100GB+ data, ensuring 
         strong performance during data load and normal operations).
       - Set storage to 150GB (100GB data + 30% headroom).
       - Default disk IOPS for M40 will provide ample performance for both 
         migration and ongoing workload.

       Let’s proceed with this setup.  

       A few quick clarifications:

       - Is this a production environment with performance/uptime requirements?
       - Do you expect rapid growth in data or traffic soon?
       - Any preference for AWS, GCP, or Azure within Europe, or should we 
         proceed with AWS?

       I’ll configure the cluster now with these optimized settings.

Again, you can accept and save the suggested configuration or continue working
towards a configuration that better meets your needs with the
{+cluster-ai-assist+}.

Modify a Cluster with the {+cluster-ai-assist+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Describe changes in your use case and needs and have the {+cluster-ai-assist+}
suggest how to best modify your cluster configurations.

For example, you can discuss budget constraints with the {+cluster-ai-assist+}.

.. io-code-block::
    :copyable: true

    .. input::

       My cluster costs more than expected. Is there a setup that keeps
       us under $500/mo?

    .. output::
       :visible: false

       To keep monthly costs under $500, I recommend switching to an M30 tier. 
       This provides reliable performance for standard production workloads at 
       around $394/month on AWS, plus some buffer for backups and storage.

       Here’s how I’ll configure it:

       - Instance size: M30 (entry-level dedicated, good for most production 
         apps)
       - Region: N. Virginia (US_EAST_1) (stays consistent with your existing 
         clusters)
       - Disk size: 40GB (default for M30, suitable for moderate workloads)
       - No additional IOPS or premium storage (keeps costs down)
       - No analytics/search node or advanced add-ons

       Let’s proceed with this cost-effective configuration.

       Before finalizing, can you clarify:

       - Is this cluster for production, staging, or development?
       - What’s your estimated data volume (just rough amount of GB needed)?
       - Any specific performance requirements (high writes, reads, etc.)?

       I’ll now suggest the configuration for you.

The {+cluster-ai-assist+} suggests a new configuration.

You can also discuss increased workloads with the {+cluster-ai-assist+}.

.. io-code-block::
    :copyable: true

    .. input::

       Suggest a cluster setup as I'm expanding to India and expect 20,000
       new users and the associated data.

    .. output::
       :visible: false

       Since you're expanding to India with 20,000 expected users, you’ll need 
       a production-grade cluster deployed in an appropriate Indian region for 
       low latency. I recommend AWS as the cloud provider (unless you have a 
       preference for GCP or Azure), using the AP_SOUTH_1 region (Mumbai).

       For your user base and workload size, an M30 dedicated tier is a strong 
       fit—it’s ideal for mid-sized production apps. This setup will handle 
       moderate to high traffic and provides headroom as your user base grows.

       I'll set:

       - Cloud Provider: AWS
       - Region: AP_SOUTH_1 (Mumbai, India)
       - Instance Size: M30 (production-ready with sufficient resources)
       - Disk Size: Default (40GB, upgrade later if data grows quickly)

       To refine this setup:

       - What type of workload will the cluster handle (e.g., read-heavy, 
         write-heavy, analytics)?
       - Any data volume estimate (GB/TB) for the first year?
       - Any specific cost constraints?

       Applying this recommendation now.

The {+cluster-ai-assist+} suggests a configuration that can accommodate your 
scaled needs.
