ref: 4.2-rollbacks
content: |

  - For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.2"``,
    MongoDB waits for any in-progress
    :ref:`index builds <index-operations>` to finish before starting a 
    rollback.

  For more information on the index build process, see
  :ref:`index-operations`.

ref: 4.2-index-faq
content: |

  - For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.2"``, 
    MongoDB uses an optimized build process that only holds the 
    exclusive lock at the beginning and end of the index build. The rest 
    of the build process yields to interleaving read and write 
    operations.

  - For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.0"``,
    the default foreground index build process holds the exclusive lock
    for the entire index build. ``background`` index builds do *not* 
    take an exclusive lock during the build process.

  For more information on the index build process, see
  :ref:`index-operations`.

ref: 4.2-index-limit
content: |

  - For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.2"``
    and later, the index build memory limit applies to all index builds.
