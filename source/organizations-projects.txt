To access |service|, you must have an |service| user account. If you
are an existing MongoDB Cloud Manager user, you can use your Cloud
Manager credentials.

To access an organization or a project within that organization, a user
must be a member of that organization. Depending on the user's
:ref:`role in the organization <organization-roles>`, the |service|
user may be required to be a member of the project as well to access a
project.

To access clusters in a project, users must belong to that project.
Users can belong to multiple projects.

Within an organization, you can group users into teams. Users can
belong multiple teams. Teams can be assigned to multiple projects, and
team members' access to the project is determined by the team's
:ref:`project role <project-roles>`.

.. important::

   |service| users are separate from database users. Database
   users can access MongoDB databases, while |service| users can access
   the |service| application itself.

Organizations and Projects
--------------------------

|service| provides a hierarchy based on organizations and projects to
facilitate the management of your |service| clusters. Groups are now
known as Projects. You can put multiple Projects under an Organization.

.. _organizations:

Organizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the organizations and projects hierarchy, an organization can
contain multiple projects (previously referred to as groups). Under
this structure:

.. include:: /includes/list-organization-hierarchy.rst

Previously, users managed deployments by groups, where each group was
managed separately even if a user belonged multiple groups.

.. _projects:

Projects
~~~~~~~~

Groups are now projects in the organizations and projects hierarchy.
With the organizations projects hierarchy, you can create multiple
projects in an organization.

.. include:: /includes/list-projects-hierarchy.rst

Clusters
````````

Clusters are now associated with projects. As before, clusters
must have unique names within projects.

.. include:: /includes/fact-cluster-project-limit.rst

Users and Teams
---------------

User must be a member of an organization to access the organization or
a project within that organization. Depending on the user's role in the
organization, the |service| user may be also required to be a member of
the project in order to access a project.

At the organization level, you can group users into
:doc:`teams </access/manage-teams-in-orgs>`. You can use
teams to bulk assign organization users to projects within the
organization.
