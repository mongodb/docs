     If you are having trouble connecting to your {+dl+}, double check 
     that you have added your IP address to your :atlas:`IP Access List 
     </tutorial/whitelist-connection-ip-address/>` and that you are

     :atlas:`create a new database user 
     </tutorial/create-mongodb-user-for-cluster/>`.
