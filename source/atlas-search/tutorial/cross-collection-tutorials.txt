The following tutorials take you through the steps for querying across 
multiple collections:

- The :ref:`cross-collection-indexes-and-queries` tutorial demonstrates 
  how to index and query on multiple collections using a combination of 
  On-Demand Materialized Views and {+atlas-app-services+} Scheduled 
  Triggers.
- The :ref:`lookup-with-search-tutorial` tutorial demonstrates how to 
  perform cross-collection search by first joining collections in the 
  same database using :pipeline:`$lookup`, and then running a query in 
  the sub-pipeline using :pipeline:`$search`.
