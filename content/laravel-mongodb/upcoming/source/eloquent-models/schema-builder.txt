Overview
--------

Laravel provides a **facade** to access the schema builder class ``Schema``,
which lets you create and modify tables, or collections in MongoDB.
Facades are static interfaces to classes that make the syntax more
concise and improve testability.

The {+odm-short+} supports a subset of the index and collection management methods
in the Laravel ``Schema`` facade.

To learn more about facades, see `Facades <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/facades>`__
in the Laravel documentation.

The following sections describe the Laravel schema builder features available
in the {+odm-short+} and show examples of how to use them:

- :ref:`laravel-eloquent-migrations`
- :ref:`laravel-eloquent-schema-validation`
- :ref:`laravel-eloquent-collection-exists`
- :ref:`laravel-eloquent-indexes`

Perform Laravel Migrations
--------------------------

Laravel migrations let you programmatically create, modify, and delete
your database schema by running methods included in the ``Schema`` facade.
The following sections explain how to author a migration class when you use
a MongoDB database and how to run them.

Modifying databases and collections from within a migration provides a
controlled approach that ensures consistency, version control, and reversibility in your
application.

Create a Migration Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create migration classes manually or generate them by using the
``php artisan make:migration`` command. If you generate them, you must make the
following changes to perform the schema changes on your MongoDB database:

- Replace the ``Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint`` import with
  ``MongoDB\Laravel\Schema\Blueprint`` if it is referenced in your migration
- Use only commands and syntax supported by the {+odm-short+}

.. tip::

   If your default database connection is set to anything other than your
   MongoDB database, update the following setting to make sure the migration
   specifies the correct database:

   - Make sure your ``connections`` array item contains a valid ``mongodb``
     entry in your ``config/database.php`` file
   - Specify ``"mongodb"`` in the ``$connection`` field of your migration class

The following example migration class contains the following methods:

- ``up()``, which creates a collection and an index when you run the migration
- ``down()``, which drops the collection and all the indexes on it when you roll back the migration

.. literalinclude:: /includes/schema-builder/astronauts_migration.php
   :dedent:
   :language: php
   :emphasize-lines: 6, 11

Run or Roll Back a Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the database migration from a class file, run the following command
after replacing the placeholder:

.. code-block:: bash

   php artisan migrate --path=<path to your migration class file>

This command runs the ``up()`` function in the class file to create the
collection and index in the database specified in the ``config/database.php``
file.

To roll back the migration, run the following command after replacing the
placeholder:

.. code-block:: bash

   php artisan migrate:rollback --path=<path to your migration class file>

This command runs the ``down()`` function in the class file to drop the
collection and related indexes.

To learn more about Laravel migrations, see
`Database: Migrations <https://laravel.com/docs/{+laravel-docs-version+}/migrations>`__
in the Laravel documentation.

.. _laravel-eloquent-schema-validation:

Implement Schema Validation
---------------------------

Starting in {+odm-short+} v5.5, you can use the ``jsonSchema()`` method
to implement :manual:`schema validation </core/schema-validation/>` when
using the following schema builder methods:

- ``Schema::create()``: When creating a new collection
- ``Schema::table()``: When updating collection properties

You can use schema validation to restrict data types and value ranges of
document fields in a specified collection. After you implement schema
validation, the server restricts write operations that don't follow the
validation rules.

You can pass the following parameters to ``jsonSchema()``:

- ``schema``: Array that specifies the validation rules for the
  collection. To learn more about constructing a schema, see
  the :manual:`$jsonSchema </reference/operator/query/jsonSchema/>`
  reference in the {+server-docs-name+}.

- ``validationLevel``: Sets the level of validation enforcement.
  Accepted values are ``"strict"`` (default) and ``"moderate"``.

- ``validationAction``: Specifies the action to take when invalid
  operations are attempted. Accepted values are ``"error"`` (default) and
  ``"warn"``.

This example demonstrates how to specify a schema in the
``jsonSchema()`` method when creating a collection. The schema
validation has the following specifications:

- Documents in the ``pilots`` collection must
  contain the ``license_number`` field.

- The ``license_number`` field must have an integer value between
  ``1000`` and ``9999``.

- If you attempt to perform invalid write operations, the server raises
  an error.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/schema-builder/flights_migration.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-json-schema
   :end-before: end-json-schema

If you attempt to insert a document into the ``pilots`` collection that
violates the schema validation rule, {+odm-long+} returns a
:php:`BulkWriteException <mongodb-driver-exception-bulkwriteexception>`.

.. _laravel-eloquent-collection-exists:

Check Whether a Collection Exists
---------------------------------

To check whether a collection exists, call the ``hasCollection()`` method on
the ``Schema`` facade in your migration file. You can use this to
perform migration logic conditionally.

The following example migration creates a ``telescopes`` collection if a collection
named ``stars`` exists:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/schema-builder/stars_migration.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin conditional create
   :end-before: end conditional create

.. _laravel-eloquent-indexes:

Manage Indexes
--------------

MongoDB indexes are data structures that improve query efficiency by reducing
the number of documents needed to retrieve query results. Certain indexes, such
as geospatial indexes, extend how you can query the data.

To improve query performance by using an index, make sure the index covers
the query. To learn more about indexes and query optimization, see the
following {+server-docs-name+} entries:

- :manual:`Indexes </indexes>`
- :manual:`Query Optimization </core/query-optimization/>`

The following sections show how you can use the schema builder to create and
drop various types of indexes on a collection.

Create an Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create indexes, perform the following actions:

1. Call the ``create()`` method on the ``Schema`` facade
   in your migration file.

#. Pass it the collection name and a callback method with a
   ``MongoDB\Laravel\Schema\Blueprint`` parameter.

#. Specify the index creation details on the ``Blueprint`` instance.

The following example migration creates indexes on the following collection
fields:

- Single field index on ``mission_type``
- Compound index on ``launch_location`` and ``launch_date``, specifying a descending sort order on ``launch_date``
- Unique index on the ``mission_id`` field, specifying the index name ``"unique_mission_id_idx"``

Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the indexes created by running
the migration, including the default index on the ``_id`` field:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/schema-builder/flights_migration.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin create index
      :end-before: end create index

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' },
        { v: 2, key: { mission_type: 1 }, name: 'mission_type_1' },
        {
          v: 2,
          key: { launch_location: 1, launch_date: -1 },
          name: 'launch_location_1_launch_date_-1'
        },
        {
          v: 2,
          key: { mission_id: 1 },
          name: 'unique_mission_id_idx',
          unique: true
        }
      ]

Specify Index Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB index options determine how the indexes are used and stored.
You can specify index options when calling an index creation method, such
as ``index()``, on a ``Blueprint`` instance.

The following migration code shows how to add a collation to an index as an
index option. Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the indexes
created by running the migration, including the default index on the ``_id``
field:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/schema-builder/passengers_migration.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin index options
      :end-before: end index options

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' },
        {
          v: 2,
          key: { last_name: 1 },
          name: 'passengers_collation_idx',
          collation: {
            locale: 'de@collation=phonebook',
            caseLevel: false,
            caseFirst: 'off',
            strength: 3,
            numericOrdering: true,
            alternate: 'non-ignorable',
            maxVariable: 'punct',
            normalization: false,
            backwards: false,
            version: '57.1'
          }
        }
      ]

To learn more about index options, see :manual:`Options for All Index Types </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/#options-for-all-index-types>`
in the {+server-docs-name+}.

.. _laravel-schema-builder-special-idx:

Create Sparse, TTL, and Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use {+odm-long+} helper methods to create the following types of
indexes:

- Sparse indexes, which allow index entries only for documents that contain the
  specified field
- Time-to-live (TTL) indexes, which expire after a set amount of time
- Unique indexes, which prevent inserting documents that contain duplicate
  values for the indexed field

To create these index types, perform the following actions:

1. Call the ``create()`` method on the ``Schema`` facade
   in your migration file.
   
#. Pass ``create()`` the collection name and a callback method with a
   ``MongoDB\Laravel\Schema\Blueprint`` parameter.

#. Call the appropriate helper method for the index type on the
   ``Blueprint`` instance and pass the index creation details.

The following migration code shows how to create a sparse and a TTL index
by using the index helpers. Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see
the indexes created by running the migration, including the default index on
the ``_id`` field:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/schema-builder/planets_migration.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin index helpers
      :end-before: end index helpers

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' },
        { v: 2, key: { rings: 1 }, name: 'rings_1', sparse: true },
        {
          v: 2,
          key: { last_visible_dt: 1 },
          name: 'last_visible_dt_1',
          expireAfterSeconds: 86400
        }
      ]

You can specify sparse, TTL, and unique indexes on either a single field or
compound index by specifying them in the index options.

The following migration code shows how to create all three types of indexes
on a single field. Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the indexes
created by running the migration, including the default index on the ``_id``
field:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/schema-builder/planets_migration.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin multi index helpers
      :end-before: end multi index helpers

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' },
        {
          v: 2,
          key: { last_visible_dt: 1 },
          name: 'last_visible_dt_1',
          unique: true,
          sparse: true,
          expireAfterSeconds: 3600
        }
      ]

To learn more about these indexes, see :manual:`Index Properties </core/indexes/index-properties/>`
in the {+server-docs-name+}.

.. _laravel-eloquent-geospatial-index:

Create a Geospatial Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In MongoDB, geospatial indexes let you query geospatial coordinate data for
inclusion, intersection, and proximity.

To create geospatial indexes, perform the following actions:

1. Call the ``create()`` method on the ``Schema`` facade
   in your migration file.
   
#. Pass ``create()`` the collection name and a callback method with a
   ``MongoDB\Laravel\Schema\Blueprint`` parameter.

#. Specify the geospatial index creation details on the ``Blueprint``
   instance.

The following example migration creates a ``2d`` and ``2dsphere`` geospatial
index on the ``spaceports`` collection. Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}`
button to see the indexes created by running the migration, including the
default index on the ``_id`` field:

.. io-code-block::
   .. input:: /includes/schema-builder/spaceports_migration.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin create geospatial index
      :end-before: end create geospatial index

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' },
        {
          v: 2,
          key: { launchpad_location: '2dsphere' },
          name: 'launchpad_location_2dsphere',
          '2dsphereIndexVersion': 3
        },
        { v: 2, key: { runway_location: '2d' }, name: 'runway_location_2d' }
      ]


To learn more about geospatial indexes, see
:manual:`Geospatial Indexes </core/indexes/index-types/index-geospatial/>` in
the {+server-docs-name+}.

Drop an Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To drop indexes from a collection, perform the following actions:

1. Call the ``table()`` method on the ``Schema`` facade in your
   migration file.
   
#. Pass it the table name and a callback method with a
   ``MongoDB\Laravel\Schema\Blueprint`` parameter.

#. Call the ``dropIndex()`` method with the index name on the
   ``Blueprint`` instance.

.. note::

   If you drop a collection, MongoDB automatically drops all the indexes
   associated with it.

The following example migration drops an index called ``unique_mission_id_idx``
from the ``flights`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/schema-builder/flights_migration.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin drop index
   :end-before: end drop index

.. _laravel-schema-builder-atlas-idx:

Manage {+search+} and Vector Search Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In MongoDB, :atlas:`{+search+} indexes
</atlas-search/manage-indexes/>` support your full-text queries.
:atlas:`{+vector-search+} indexes
</atlas-vector-search/vector-search-type/>` support similarity
searches that compare query vectors to vector embeddings in your
documents.

View the following guides to learn more about the {+search+} and
{+vector-search+} features:

- :ref:`laravel-atlas-search` guide
- :ref:`laravel-vector-search` guide

{+search+}
````````````````

To create {+search+} indexes, perform the following actions:

1. Call the ``create()`` method on the ``Schema`` facade in your
   migration file.

#. Pass ``create()`` the collection name and a callback method with a
   ``MongoDB\Laravel\Schema\Blueprint`` parameter.

#. Pass the Search index creation details to the ``searchIndex()`` method
   on the ``Blueprint`` instance.

This example migration creates the following {+search+} indexes on the
``galaxies`` collection:

- ``dynamic_index``: Creates dynamic mappings
- ``auto_index``: Supports autocomplete queries on the ``name`` field

Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the Search
indexes created by running the migration:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/schema-builder/galaxies_migration.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin-create-search-indexes
      :end-before: end-create-search-indexes

   .. output::

            "fields": { "name": [
              { "type": "string", "analyzer": "lucene.english" }, 
              { "type": "autocomplete", "analyzer": "lucene.english" },
              { "type": "token" }
            ] } 
          } 
        },
        ...
      }

Vector Search
`````````````

To create {+vector-search+} indexes, perform the following actions:

1. Call the ``create()`` method on the ``Schema`` facade in your
   migration file.

#. Pass ``create()`` the collection name and a callback method with a
   ``MongoDB\Laravel\Schema\Blueprint`` parameter.

#. Pass the vector index creation details to the ``vectorSearchIndex()``
   method on the ``Blueprint`` instance. 

The following example migration creates a {+vector-search+} index called
``vs_index`` on the ``galaxies`` collection.

Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the Search
indexes created by running the migration:

.. io-code-block::
   .. input:: /includes/schema-builder/galaxies_migration.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin-create-vs-index
      :end-before: end-create-vs-index

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      {
        "id": "...", 
        "name": "vs_index",
        "type": "vectorSearch",
        "status": "READY",
        "queryable": true,
        "latestDefinition": {
          "fields": [ { 
              "type": "vector",
              "numDimensions": 4,
              "path": "embeddings",
              "similarity": "cosine"
          } ]
        },
        ...
      }

Drop a Search Index
```````````````````

To drop a {+search+} or {+vector-search+} index from a collection,
perform the following actions:

1. Call the ``table()`` method on the ``Schema`` facade in your migration file.

#. Pass it the collection name and a callback method with a
   ``MongoDB\Laravel\Schema\Blueprint`` parameter.

#. Call the ``dropSearchIndex()`` method with the Search index name on
   the ``Blueprint`` instance. 

The following example migration drops an index called ``auto_index``
from the ``galaxies`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/schema-builder/galaxies_migration.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-drop-search-index
   :end-before: end-drop-search-index
