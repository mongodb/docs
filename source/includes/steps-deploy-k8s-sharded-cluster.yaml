          following collections to meet your deployment requirements:

          - If you want one |k8s-pv| for each |k8s-pod|, configure the
            :setting:`spec.shardPodSpec.persistence.single` and
            :setting:`spec.configSrvPodSpec.persistence.single`
            collections.

          - If you want separate |k8s-pvs| for data, journals, and
            logs for each |k8s-pod|, configure the following
            collections:

            - In the ``spec.configSrvPodSpec.persistence.multiple``
              collection:
              - :setting:`.data <spec.configSrvPodSpec.persistence.multiple.data>`

              - :setting:`.journal <spec.shardPodSpec.persistence.multiple.journal>`
