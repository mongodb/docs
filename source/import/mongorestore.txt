==========================
Seed with ``mongorestore``
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


You can use |mongodump| and |mongorestore| to seed |service-fullname|
cluster with data from an existing MongoDB standalone or replica set.
For guidance on seeding data from an existing MongoDB sharded cluster,
contact |service| support by clicking :guilabel:`Support` in the
left-hand navigation of the |service| user interface.

Considerations
--------------

Minimum Recommended ``mongodump`` and ``mongorestore`` Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the latest stable release version of |mongodump|
and |mongorestore| for this procedure.

Downtime Required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure a completely up-to-date migration, schedule a maintenance
window where you can stop all writes to your source cluster.
Any write operations issued to the source cluster after the
|mongodump| portion of the procedure completes
are not migrated to the target cluster.

You must cut-over your applications to the target |service| cluster
after |mongorestore| completes the
data restoration before resuming write operations.
See :doc:`/connect-to-cluster` for complete
documentation on connecting to a |service| cluster.

The total amount of downtime required depends on factors such as the
size of data being migrated and the network connection between your
source cluster and |service|. If you have questions or concerns about
extended downtime, contact |service| support by clicking
:guilabel:`Support` from the left-hand navigation of the |service| UI.

For a guided minimal-downtime migration procedure, see
:ref:`Replica Set Live Migration <live-import-replica>` or
:ref:`Sharded Cluster Live Migration <live-import-sharded>`.

Cluster Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| fully manages database user creation. If the source
cluster enforces authentication,
use the |mongorestore|
:option:`--nsExclude <mongorestore.--nsExclude>` to exclude the
``admin.system.*`` namespace. You cannot migrate any existing user or
role information to |service|.

.. note::

   If you use |mongorestore| with the
   :option:`--oplogReplay <mongorestore.--oplogReplay>` option, you
   will not be able to use the :option:`--nsExclude
   <mongorestore.--nsExclude>` option to exclude the ``admin.system.*``
   namespace. Instead, go into the ``dump`` directory created by
   |mongodump| and delete the ``admin``
   directory before running |mongorestore|.

For the target |service| cluster, create the appropriate database users
for supporting your application's usage patterns. Update your
applications as part of the cut-over procedure to use the new database
users. To learn more, see :ref:`mongodb-users`.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure requires running |mongodump| and
|mongorestore| on a host in the source
cluster. These programs use system resources such as CPU and memory,
and may impact the performance of the host.

Consider executing this procedure during non-peak system usage,
or during a scheduled maintenance window. If the source is a replica
set, you can run this procedure from the host of a :term:`secondary`
member. After stopping writes to the cluster, allow the secondary to
catch up to the primary before starting this procedure.

Pipe Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure uses
`linux pipes <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pipe.2.html>`__ to
stream the output of |mongodump| to |mongorestore|. If the
|mongorestore| process cannot keep up with the |mongodump| process,
you may encounter broken pipe errors.

For guidance on addressing persistent broken pipe errors,
contact |service| support by clicking :guilabel:`Support` from the
left-hand navigation of the |service| user interface.
