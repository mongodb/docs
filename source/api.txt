   :description: Access the Atlas for Government API using a specific base URL and learn about its authentication, usage, and limitations.

The |cloudgov| |api| functions in the same way as the |service| |api|, 
except that it uses the following base URL:

.. code-block:: shell

   https://cloud.mongodbgov.com/api/atlas/v2

|cloudgov-short| authenticates |api| requests with ``SHA-256`` using 
:atlas:`HTTP Digest Authentication </api/#std-label-api-authentication>`.

Example Usage
-------------

This ``curl`` example retrieves database users for a project:

.. code-block:: shell

   curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
     --header "Accept: application/json" \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --header "Accept: application/vnd.atlas.2023-01-01+json" \ # update date to desired API version
     --include \
     --request GET "https://cloud.mongodbgov.com/api/atlas/v2/groups/{PROJECT-ID}/databaseUsers?pretty=true"

- You can find your ``PROJECT-ID`` in your :guilabel:`Project Settings`.

- You can generate an |api| key pair in your organization's 
  :guilabel:`Access Manager`, under the :guilabel:`API Keys` tab.

See the Atlas Documentation
---------------------------

- To learn more about using the |api|, see the 
  :atlas:`Atlas API </api/>`.

- To configure the API, see 
  :atlas:`Configure Atlas API Access </configure-api-access/>`.

- For a list of possible errors, see 
  :atlas:`Atlas API Error Codes </reference/api/api-errors/>`.

Creating a Project
------------------

.. include:: /includes/considerations/gov-commercial-regions.rst

By default, the |cloudgov-short| API designates new projects for 
standard region usage.

To use the API to create a project for government regions, include 
the following in your ``POST`` request data:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true

   "regionUsageRestrictions" : "GOV_REGIONS_ONLY"

.. tip:: |service| documentation

   For detailed information on creating a project with the API, 
   including an example request, see 
   :atlas:`Create One Project </reference/api/project-create-one/>`.

{+gov-considerations+}

- |azure|

- |service| Data Lake

- |service| Online Archives

- |service| Triggers

- MongoDB Charts

- Atlas Device SDKs

- Free, Shared, Flex, and ``M10`` clusters

Many of the commercial |service| |api| resources are limited or 
unavailable:

Database Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Database users who authenticate with 
:manual:`SCRAM </core/security-scram/>` must use ``SCRAM-SHA-256``.

Clusters

Cloud Backups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Restores between standard projects and Gov region-only projects are not allowed. 
If a backup is created from a cluster in a Gov region-only 
(|aws-fr-high| or |gaw|) project, the data can only be restored to a cluster 
in a Gov region-only project. The same restriction applies to standard projects, 
where backups in standard regions can only be restored to clusters in standard projects.

Cross-cloud restore is supported between |aws-fr-high| and |gaw| regions. 

Flex and Shared Cluster Snapshots and Restore Jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flex and Shared clusters are unavailable in |cloudgov-short|.

Online Archive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Online Archives are unavailable in |cloudgov-short|.

Network Peering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can only peer |aws-fr-high| regions with MongoDB clusters in 
  |aws-fr-high| regions. You can only peer |aws-fr-moderate| regions 
  with MongoDB clusters in |aws-fr-moderate| regions.
- You can only peer |gaw| regions with MongoDB clusters in 
  |gaw| regions.

Private Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can only link |aws-fr-high| regions with MongoDB clusters in 
  |aws-fr-high| regions. You can only link |aws-fr-moderate| regions 
  with MongoDB clusters in |aws-fr-moderate| regions.
- You can only link |gaw| regions with MongoDB clusters in 
  |gaw| regions.

Monitoring and Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the standard Atlas logging, 
|cloudgov-short| logs the username and IP address associated with all 
failed login attempts, temporary lockouts and failed |api| digest 
authentications.

Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You must use KMS keys in |aws-fr-high| and |gaw| regions to encrypt data in 
  |aws-fr-high| and |gaw| region-only projects. You must use KMS keys in 
  |aws-fr-moderate| regions to encrypt data in |aws-fr-moderate| 
  region-only projects.

Atlas Users
~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot create |cloudgov| users. |cloudgov| is available by 
invitation only.
