  The |fts| results contain movies with ``car`` and ``automobile`` in 
  the ``title`` field although the query term is ``automobile`` because 
  we configured ``automobile`` to be a synonym of ``car``, ``vehicle``, 
  and ``automobile`` in the synonyms source collection named 
  ``sample_synonyms``, which is specified in the index for the 
  collection. |fts| returns the same results for a search of the words 
  ``car`` and ``vehicle``. To test this, replace the value of the 
  ``query`` field in the query above with either ``car`` or ``vehicle`` 
  and run the query in your {+mongosh+}.

  The |fts| results contain movies with ``boat``, ``vessel``, and 
  ``sail`` in the ``title`` field because we configured ``boat``, 
  ``vessel``, and ``sail`` to be synonyms of ``boat`` in the synonyms 
  source collection named ``sample_synonyms``, which is specified in 
  the index for the collection. 
        
  |fts| returns the following documents only for a search of the word 
  ``vessel`` in the results:

  .. code-block:: json 
     :copyable: false 

     { "title" : "Vessel", "score" : 5.373150825500488 }
     { "title" : "Broken Vessels", "score" : 4.3452959060668945 }

  |fts| doesn't include documents with either ``boat`` or ``sail`` in 
  the ``title`` field in the results because we didn't configure 
  ``vessel`` to be a synonym of either ``boat`` or ``sail`` in the 
  synonyms source collection. To test this, replace the value of the 
  ``query`` field in the query above with ``vessel`` and run the query again. 

  Similarly, |fts| returns the following documents only in the results 
  for a search of the term ``sail``:

  .. code-block:: json 
     :copyable: false

     { "title" : "And the Ship Sails On", "score" : 4.3452959060668945 }
     { "title" : "Sailing to Paradise", "score" : 4.3452959060668945 }

  |fts| doesn't include documents with either ``boat`` or ``vessel`` in 
  the ``title`` field in the results because we didn't configure 
  ``sail`` to be a synonym of either ``boat`` or ``vessel`` in the 
  synonyms source collection. To test this, replace the value of the 
  ``query`` field in the query above with ``sail`` and run the query again.
