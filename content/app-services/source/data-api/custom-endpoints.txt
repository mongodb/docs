You can define custom HTTPS endpoints to create app-specific API routes
or webhooks that integrate with external services. A custom endpoint
uses a serverless function that you write to handle incoming requests
for a specific URL and HTTP method.

.. note:: 

   Custom HTTPS Endpoints are not supported in 
   :ref:`private endpoints <private-endpoints>`.

Endpoints use standard, encrypted HTTPS requests, which means that you
don't need to install any database drivers or opinionated libraries to
call them. Instead, you send requests like this from any HTTP client:

.. literalinclude:: /data-api/snippets/custom-endpoints.snippet.hello.sh
   :language: bash

Structure of an Endpoint
------------------------

An endpoint handles one or more HTTP methods sent to a specific URL.

.. _endpoint-base-url:

Base URL
~~~~~~~~

Endpoints in an app share a base URL. The URL uses your App ID to
uniquely point to your app.

Globally deployed apps use the following format:

.. code-block:: none
   :caption: Endpoint Base URL (Global Apps):

   https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint
   
Endpoints in a locally deployed app use a base URL specific to the app's
:ref:`deployment region <deployment-regions>` (e.g. ``us-east-1``)

.. code-block:: none
   :caption: Endpoint Base URL (Local Apps)

   https://<Region>.aws.data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint

.. _endpoint-route:

Endpoint Routes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every HTTPS endpoint has a route that serves as a name for the endpoint.
An endpoint's route is arbitrary and specific to your app. However, it
appears in the endpoint URL path and so should represent the action the
route performs.

Route names must begin with a forward slash (``/``) and may contain
additional forward slashes to indicate a nested path.

.. code-block:: none
   :caption: An endpoint route
   
   /my/nested/route

You call an endpoint by appending its route to your app's base URL and
sending an HTTP request.

.. code-block:: none
   :caption: An endpoint URL
   
   https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/<App ID>/endpoint/my/nested/route

.. _endpoint-http-method:

HTTP Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each endpoint in your app handles one or more :mdn:`HTTP methods
<Web/HTTP/Methods>` for a given route. For example, you might have a
single route that accepts ``POST`` requests to create a new resource and
a ``GET`` request to list existing resources.

You can define multiple custom endpoints that serve the same route but
handle different request methods. Alternatively, you can define a single
endpoint for the route that handles all methods.

Custom endpoints support the following standard HTTP methods:

- :mdn:`GET <Web/HTTP/Methods/GET>`
- :mdn:`POST <Web/HTTP/Methods/POST>`
- :mdn:`PUT <Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT>`
- :mdn:`PATCH <Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH>`
- :mdn:`DELETE <Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE>`

.. _create-custom-endpoint: 

Create a Custom HTTPS Endpoint
------------------------------

You can configure the Data API for your app from the App Services UI or by
deploying configuration files with {+cli+}:

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      1. Click :guilabel:`HTTPS Endpoints` in the left navigation menu and then
         click :guilabel:`Add An Endpoint`.
      
      2. Define the endpoint :guilabel:`Route`. Route names must begin
         with a forward slash (``/``) and may contain additional forward
         slashes to indicate a nested path.
      
      3. Choose an :ref:`HTTP method <endpoint-http-method>` for the
         endpoint from the dropdown. You can choose either a specific
         method (e.g. ``GET`` or ``POST``) or configure the endpoint to
         accept *any* HTTP method (i.e. ``ANY``).
      
      4. Choose a :ref:`response type <data-api-response-type>`, either
         JSON or EJSON. You can enable :guilabel:`Respond With Result`
         to automatically include the endpoint function's return value
         as the response body.

      5. Write an :ref:`endpoint function <endpoint-function>` that
         handles requests for the endpoint. Alternatively, specify an
         existing function by name.
      
      6. For additional security, you can configure :ref:`request
         authorization <endpoint-authorization>`.
      
      7. Save the Data API configuration.
      
      8. Configure :ref:`access permissions <data-api-permissions>` to
         allow requests to securely read and write data.
      
      9. Save and deploy your app.
     
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      1. Pull the latest version of your app.
         
         .. code-block:: bash

            {+cli-bin+} pull --remote="<Your App ID>"
      
      2. Define a :ref:`configuration <appconfig-endpoints>` object for
         the custom endpoint.
         
         .. code-block:: bash
            :caption: http_endpoints/config.json

            [
              {
                "route": "<Endpoint route name>",
                "http_method": "<HTTP method>",
                "function_name": "<Endpoint function name",
                "validation_method": "<Authorization scheme>",
                "respond_result": <boolean>,
                "fetch_custom_user_data": <boolean>,
                "create_user_on_auth": <boolean>,
                "disabled": <boolean>
              }
            ]
      
      3. Define :ref:`rules <config-collection-rules>` for one or more
         collections.
         
         .. code-block:: bash
            :caption: data_sources/mongodb-atlas/<db>/<collection>/rules.json

            {
              "database": "<Database Name>",
              "collection": "<Collection Name>",
              "roles": [<Role>],
              "filters": [<Filter>]
            }
      
      4. Deploy your app.
         
         .. code-block:: bash
            
            {+cli-bin+} push

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom endpoints run in the context of a specific user, which allows
your app to enforce rules and validate document schemas for each
request.

By default, endpoints use Application Authentication, which requires
each request to include credentials for one of your application users,
like an API key or JWT. You can also configure other custom
authentication schemes to fit your application's needs.

For examples of how to authenticate requests, see :ref:`Authenticate
Data API Requests <data-api-authenticate-requests>`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Application
      :tabid: auth-credentials

      Application authentication requires users to log in with an
      authentication provider that you have enabled for your App.
      Requests can either include an access token granted by the
      authentication provider or the credentials the user would log in
      with (e.g. their API key or email and password).
   
   .. tab:: User ID
      :tabid: auth-userid

      User ID authentication runs all requests as a single, pre-selected
      application user. This is useful if all requests should have the
      same permissions regardless of who called the endpoint.
      
      To select the user, specify their User Account ID in the endpoint
      configuration.
      
      .. code-block:: json
         :caption: functions/config.json
         
         [
           {
             ...,
             "run_as_user_id": "628e47baf4c2ac2796fc8a91"
           }
         ]
   
   .. tab:: Script
      :tabid: auth-script
   
      Script authentication calls a function to determine which
      application user a request runs as. You can use this to implement
      custom authentication and authorization schemes.

      The function must return an existing application user's Account ID
      as a string or ``{ "runAsSystem": true }`` to run the request
      as a :ref:`system user <system-user>` that has full access to
      MongoDB CRUD and Aggregation APIs and is not subject to any
      rules, roles, or limited permissions.

      To define the function, specify the source code in the endpoint
      configuration.
      
      .. code-block:: json
         :caption: functions/config.json
         
         [
           {
             ...,
             "run_as_user_id_script_source": "exports = () => {return \"628e47baf4c2ac2796fc8a91\"}"
           }
         ]
   
   .. tab:: System
      :tabid: auth-system

      System authentication configures an endpoint to run as a
      :ref:`system user <system-user>` that requires no credentials, has
      full access to MongoDB CRUD and Aggregation APIs, and is not
      subject to any rules, roles, or limited permissions.
      
      .. code-block:: json
         :caption: functions/config.json
         
         [
           {
             ...,
             "run_as_system": true
           }
         ]

.. tip::
   
   New endpoints that you create in the UI use System authentication by default.

.. _endpoint-authorization:

Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An endpoint can require authenticated users to provide additional
authorization information in the request. You define the authorization
scheme for each custom endpoint by configuring the endpoint function.

Endpoints natively support a set of built-in authorization schemes that
use a secret string to prove that the request is authorized. You can
also define a custom authorization scheme that you can use together with
or instead of the built-in schemes.

To learn how to configure authorization for a specific function, see
:ref:`Define a Function <define-a-function>`.

Built-In Authorization Schemes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Endpoints support the following built-in authorization schemes:

.. tabs::
     
   .. tab:: No Additional Authorization
      :tabid: no-authorization
   
      All authenticated users are authorized to call the endpoint.
      Authenticated requests do not need to include authorization
      information.
      
   .. tab:: Secret Parameter
      :tabid: secret-parameter
      
      Authenticated users must prove that they are authorized to call
      the endpoint by including a specific string as the value of the
      ``secret`` query parameter.
      
      You define the string in a :ref:`secret <app-secret>` and
      reference the secret by name in the endpoint configuration.

      .. code-block:: json
         :caption: http_endpoints/config.json
         
         [
           {
              ...,
              "verification_method": "SECRET_AS_QUERY_PARAM",
              "secret_name": "secret_verification_string"
           }
         ]

      To learn how to include the secret in a request, see :ref:`Authorize the Request <endpoint-authorize>`.
   
   .. tab:: Payload Signature
      :tabid: payload-signature
   
      Authenticated users must prove that they are authorized to call
      the endpoint by including an ``Endpoint-Signature`` header that
      contains a hexadecimal-encoded :abbr:`HMAC (Hash-based Message
      Authentication Code)` SHA-256 hash generated from the request body
      and a secret string.

      You define the string in a :ref:`secret <app-secret>` and
      reference the secret by name in the endpoint configuration.

      To learn how to sign your requests, see :ref:`Authorize the Request <endpoint-authorize>`.

Custom Authorization Schemes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can define a custom authorization :ref:`expression <expressions>` to
determine if an incoming authenticated request is allowed to run. The
expression is evaluated for each request and must evaluate to ``true``
to allow the request. If the expression evaluates to ``false``, the
request is not authorized and fails with an error. Requests that fail
authorization are not counted toward your App's billed usage.

Authorization expressions can use variables like
:json-expansion:`%%user` to authorize based on the calling user's data
or :json-expansion:`%%request` to make decisions based on the specifics
of each incoming request.

To define a custom authorization scheme, specify the expression in the
endpoint function's configuration:

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: http_endpoints/config.json
         
   [
     {
        ...,
        "can_evaluate": {
          "%%request.requestHeaders.x-secret-key": "my-secret"
        }
     }
   ]

.. _endpoint-function:

Write an Endpoint Function
--------------------------

Every custom endpoint is associated with a :ref:`function <functions>`
that runs whenever the endpoint receives an incoming request. In the
function, you can import libraries from npm, connect to a linked MongoDB
Atlas cluster, and call other serverless functions. 

To define a new function when :ref:`creating an endpoint 
<create-custom-endpoint>` in the App Services UI, navigate
to the :guilabel:`Function` section and select
:guilabel:`+ New Function` from the dropdown.

Depending on your workflow, you can also define and edit endpoint 
handler functions:

- On the :guilabel:`Functions` page in the :ref:`App Services UI 
  <define-a-function>`.
- In the ``functions`` directory of your application using the 
  :ref:`App Services CLI <define-a-function>`.
- From your client using the :admin-api-endpoint:`Admin API 
  <operation/adminCreateFunction>`.

Endpoint functions always receive two arguments:

- A :ref:`Request <endpoint-request-object>` object that lets you access
  incoming request headers, query parameters, and body data.
- A :ref:`Response <endpoint-response-object>` object that you use to
  configure the HTTPS response sent back to the caller.

For a sample function and an example request and response, see 
:ref:`endpoint-function-example`.

.. _endpoint-request-object:

Access Request Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A custom endpoint ``Request`` object represents the HTTP request that
called the endpoint. You can access the incoming request's headers,
query parameters, and body data.

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: Endpoint Request Object
   
   {
     "headers": { "<Header>": ["<Header Value>"] },
     "query": { "<Query Parameter>": "<Parameter Value>" },
     "body": <BSON.Binary>
   }

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Field
     - Description
   
   * - ``query``
     - An object where each field maps a URL query parameter to its
       value. If a key is used multiple times in the query string, only
       the first occurence is represented in this object. To work with
       the full query string, use :ref:`context.request.rawQueryString
       <context-request>`.
       
       .. example::
          
          The following ``query`` object represents the query string
          ``?regions=na,eu&currency=USD``:

          .. code-block:: json
             
             {
               "regions": "na&eu",
               "currency": "USD"
             }
   
   * - ``headers``
     - An object where each field maps a request header name to an array
       of one or more values.
       
       .. example::
          
          .. code-block:: json
             
             {
               "Content-Type": ["application/json"],
               "Accept": ["application/json"],
               "X-CustomHeader": ["some-value", "some-other-value"]
             }
   
   * - ``body``
     - A :ref:`BSON.Binary <bson-binary>` object that contains the
       request body. If the request did not include a body, this value
       is ``undefined``.

       To access data in the request body, you need to serialize the
       binary:

       .. code-block:: javascript

          // Convert the request body to a JSON string
          const serialized = request.body.text();
          // Parse the string into a usable object
          const body = JSON.parse(serialized);

.. _endpoint-response-object:

Return an HTTPS Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A custom endpoint ``Response`` object lets you configure the HTTPS
response sent back to the caller. You can set the status code, customize
headers, and include data in the response body.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - | ``setStatusCode(code)``
       | - ``code: number``
     - Set the HTTP response :mdn:`status code <Web/HTTP/Status>`.

       .. example::

          .. code-block:: javascript

             response.setStatusCode(201);

   * - | ``setBody(body)``
       | - ``body: string | BSON.Binary``
     - Set the HTTP response :mdn:`body <Web/HTTP/Messages#Body_2>`.

       If ``body`` is a string, the endpoint automatically encodes it as
       a ``BSON.Binary``.

       .. example::

          .. code-block:: javascript

             response.setBody(
               "{'message': 'Hello, World!'}"
             );

   * - | ``setHeader(name, value)``
       | - ``name: string``
       | - ``value: string``
     - Set the HTTP response :mdn:`header <Web/HTTP/Headers>` specified
       by ``name`` to the value passed in the ``value`` argument. This
       overrides any other values that may have already been assigned to
       that header.

       .. example::

          .. code-block:: javascript

             response.setHeader(
               "Content-Type",
               "application/json"
             );

   * - | ``addHeader(name, value)``
       | - ``name: string``
       | - ``value: string``
     - Set the HTTP response :mdn:`header <Web/HTTP/Headers>` specified
       by ``name`` to the value passed in the ``value`` argument. Unlike
       ``setHeader``, this does not override other values that have
       already been assigned to the header.

       .. example::

          .. code-block:: javascript

             response.addHeader(
               "Cache-Control",
               "max-age=600"
             );

             response.addHeader(
               "Cache-Control",
               "min-fresh=60"
             )

.. _endpoint-function-example:

Example
~~~~~~~

Consider an endpoint function that parses the body of an incoming ``POST``
request, stores the parsed body in a MongoDB collection, and then
responds to the caller:

.. literalinclude:: /data-api/snippets/backend/custom.snippet.custom-endpoint-function.js
   :language: javascript

The function receives the following ``POST`` request:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /data-api/snippets/custom-endpoints.snippet.custom-function-example.sh
      :language: bash
   
   .. output::
      :language: json
      
      {
        "message": "Successfully saved the request body",
        "insertedId": "639a521bbdec9b85ba94014b"
      }

After the function verifies that the body of the incoming request 
is defined, it stores the parsed body as a new document in a collection 
named ``myCollection``. The resulting output displays the configured 
response, which includes a custom message and the ``insertedId``.

Call a Custom Endpoint
----------------------

You can call a custom endpoint from any standard HTTPS client.

.. literalinclude:: /data-api/snippets/custom-endpoints.snippet.hello.sh
   :language: bash

HTTP/1.1 or greater is required when making requests.

.. _endpoint-return-types:

Choose a Response Data Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A request can include an ``Accept`` header to request a specific data
format for the response body, either JSON or EJSON. If a request does
not include a valid ``Accept`` header, the response uses the default
data format specified in the endpoint configuration.

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: EJSON
      :tabid: ejson
      
      .. io-code-block::
         
         .. input:: /data-api/snippets/custom-endpoints.snippet.hello-latest-ejson.sh
            :language: bash
            :emphasize-lines: 3
         
         .. output::
            :language: json
            
            {
              "greeting": "Hello, Leafie!",
              "date": { "$date": { "$numberLong": "1654589430998" } }
            }
   
   .. tab:: JSON
      :tabid: json
      
      .. io-code-block::
         
         .. input:: /data-api/snippets/custom-endpoints.snippet.hello-latest-json.sh
            :language: bash
            :emphasize-lines: 3
         
         .. output::
            :language: json
            
            {
              "greeting": "Hello, Leafie!",
              "date": "2022-06-07T08:10:30.998Z"
            }

.. _endpoint-authenticate:

Authenticate the Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an endpoint is configured to use Application Authentication then you
must include a valid user access token or login credentials with every
request.

.. include:: /includes/bearer-auth-performance.rst

To use an access token, first authenticate the user through an App
Services authentication provider. Then, get the access token returned
from App Services and include it in the request's Authorization header
using a Bearer token scheme. For more information on how to acquire and
use an access token, see :ref:`Bearer Token Authentication
<data-api-bearer-authentication>`.

.. code-block:: shell
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   curl -X GET \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <AccessToken>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/myapp-abcde/endpoint/hello

Alternatively, you can include valid login credentials for the user in
the request headers.

.. _endpoint-authorize:

Authorize the Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the :ref:`endpoint configuration
<endpoint-authorization>`, your requests may need to include additional
authorization information.

.. tabs::
     
   .. tab:: No Additional Authorization
      :tabid: no-authorization
   
      All authenticated users are authorized to call the endpoint.
      Authenticated requests do not need to include authorization
      information.
      
   .. tab:: Secret Parameter
      :tabid: secret-parameter
      
      Authenticated users must prove that they are authorized to call
      the endpoint by including the endpoint's secret string as the
      value of the ``secret`` query parameter.
      
      .. example::
         
         The following ``curl`` request uses secret query parameter
         validation with the secret string ``"Super5ecr3tPa55w0rd"``:
      
         .. literalinclude:: /data-api/snippets/custom-endpoints.snippet.validation-secret-query-param.sh
            :language: bash
            :emphasize-lines: 1
   
   .. tab:: Payload Signature
      :tabid: payload-signature
   
      Authenticated users must prove that they are authorized to call
      the endpoint by including an ``Endpoint-Signature`` header that
      contains a hexadecimal-encoded :abbr:`HMAC (Hash-based Message
      Authentication Code)` SHA-256 hash generated from the request body
      and the endpoint's secret string.

      .. code-block:: none
         
         Endpoint-Signature: sha256=<hex encoded hash>
      
      You could use the following function to generate the payload
      signature:
      
      .. literalinclude:: /data-api/snippets/backend/signEndpointRequest.snippet.signEndpointRequest.js
         :language: javascript

      .. example::
         
         The following ``curl`` request includes a payload signature header
         signed with the secret value ``Super5ecr3tPa55w0rd``:

         .. literalinclude:: /data-api/snippets/custom-endpoints.snippet.validation-payload-signature.sh
            :language: bash
