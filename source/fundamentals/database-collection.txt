Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to access
and manage MongoDB databases and collections.

MongoDB organizes data in a hierarchal structure. A MongoDB
deployment contains one or more **databases**, and each database
contains one or more **collections**. In each collection, MongoDB stores
data as **documents** that contain field-and-value pairs.

To learn more about the document data format,
see :manual:`Documents </core/document/>` in the Server manual.

Access a Database
-----------------

You can access a database by retrieving a `Database
<{+api+}/struct.Database.html>`__ instance from your client. You can use
a ``Database`` instance to perform database-level operations and access
collections that the database contains.

Call one of the following methods on a `Client
<{+api+}/struct.Client.html>`__ instance to create a ``Database``:

- `database() <{+api+}/struct.Client.html#method.database>`__: retrieve a database by its name
- `database_with_options() <{+api+}/struct.Client.html#method.database_with_options>`__: set
  options (`DatabaseOptions <{+api+}/options/struct.DatabaseOptions.html>`__) while retrieving a
  database by its name
- `default_database() <{+api+}/struct.Client.html#method.default_database>`__: access the
  default database specified for your ``Client`` instance

.. tip::
   
   To specify the default database for your client, set the
   ``default_database`` field of your ``ClientOptions`` struct. If you
   do not set this field, the driver gets the default database from the
   ``defaultauthdb`` component of your connection string.

If you pass the name of a nonexistent database to the ``database()`` or
``database_with_options()`` methods, the driver still returns a
``Database`` instance. When you insert any data into collection in this
database, the server creates it.

The following example uses the ``database()`` method to access a
database called ``test_db``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/db-coll.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-database
   :end-before: end-database

List Databases
--------------
   
To see a list of your deployment's databases, call the
`list_database_names()
<{+api+}/struct.Client.html#method.list_database_names>`__ method on
your ``Client`` instance. This
method returns a ``Vec<String>`` type, a vector containing the database
names as strings.

To see detailed information about each database, call the `list_databases() <{+api+}/struct.Client.html#method.list_databases>`__
method on your ``Client`` instance. This method returns a
``Vec<DatabaseSpecification>`` type. The `DatabaseSpecification
<{+api+}/results/struct.DatabaseSpecification.html>`__ type
contains fields describing each database, such as its size and whether
it contains data.

The following example shows how to print a list of databases by using
the ``list_database_names()`` method:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/db-coll.rs
      :start-after: begin-list-db
      :end-before: end-list-db
      :language: rust
      :dedent:
   
   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false
   
      ["admin", "local", "test_db", ...]

Drop a Database
---------------

Dropping a database permanently deletes all of the data in that database's
collections. To drop a database, call the `drop()
<{+api+}/struct.Database.html#method.drop>`__ method
on your ``Database`` instance. The following code shows
how to drop a database referenced by the ``db`` variable:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/db-coll.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-drop-db
   :end-before: end-drop-db

.. warning:: Dropping a Database Deletes Data

   Dropping a database permanently deletes all
   documents in the database's collections and all indexes on those collections.
   After you drop a database, you cannot access or restore any of its data.

Access a Collection
-------------------

You can access a collection by retrieving a `Collection
<{+api+}/struct.Collection.html>`__ instance from your database. You
can use a ``Collection`` instance to perform data operations, 
create aggregations, and manage indexes. Call one of the following
methods on a ``Database`` instance to retrieve a ``Collection``:

- `collection() <{+api+}/struct.Database.html#method.collection>`__: retrieve a collection by its name
- `collection_with_options() <{+api+}/struct.Database.html#method.collection_with_options>`__: set
  options (`CollectionOptions <{+api+}/options/struct.CollectionOptions.html>`__) while accessing a
  collection by its name

If you pass the name of a nonexistent collection to the ``collection()`` or
``collection_with_options()`` methods, the driver still returns a
``Collection`` instance. When you insert any data into this
collection, the server creates it. To learn how to explicitly
create a collection, see the :ref:`Create a Collection
<rust-create-collection>` section of this guide.

This example uses the ``collection_with_options()`` method to
perform the following actions:

- Access a collection called ``coll_xyz`` from a database referenced by
  the ``db`` variable
- Set a write preference on the collection in the ``CollectionOptions`` type

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/db-coll.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-coll
   :end-before: end-coll

To learn more about write concerns, see :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>` in
the Server manual.

.. _rust-coll-parameterization:

Collection Parameterization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must parameterize your ``Collection`` instance by specifying what
data type you want to serialize the collection's
data into. When you call a method on a ``Collection`` instance that is
parameterized with a specific type, the method accepts or returns
instances of this type.

.. note::
   
   If you do not parameterize your ``Collection`` instance, the compiler
   infers the generic type when you perform a CRUD operation with a
   specified data type in the same scope.

The following example shows equivalent ways of parameterizing a
collection with the ``Document`` type:

.. code-block:: rust
   :copyable: false
   
   let my_coll: Collection<Document> = client.database("test_db").collection("coll_xyz");
   let my_coll = client.database("test_db").collection::<Document>("coll_xyz");

.. tip::

   We recommend that you parameterize your ``Collection`` instance with a
   custom type that models your data instead of the ``Document`` type.
   You can avoid repetitive serialization and validation by defining a
   type that models your specific data.

   To learn more about serialization in the {+driver-short+}, see the
   guide on :ref:`rust-serialization`.

.. _rust-create-collection:

Create a Collection
-------------------

You can explicitly create a collection by calling the
`create_collection()
<{+api+}/struct.Database.html#method.create_collection>`__ method on a
``Database`` instance. This method takes the collection name and an
optional `CreateCollectionOptions
<{+api+}/options/struct.CreateCollectionOptions.html>`__ type as
parameters. You can use a ``Collection`` instance to perform data
operations, create aggregations, and manage indexes.

The following code shows how to create a collection called ``coll_abc``
within a database referenced by the ``db`` variable:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/db-coll.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-create-coll
   :end-before: end-create-coll

When creating a collection, you can implement schema validation to
maintain a consistent document schema and control whether any write
operations can bypass the validation rules. To learn how to enable this
feature, see the guide on :ref:`rust-schema-validation`.

List Collections
----------------

To see the names of the collections in a database, call the
`list_collection_names() <{+api+}/struct.Database.html#method.list_collection_names>`__ method on your ``Database`` instance. This
method returns a ``Vec<String>`` type, a vector containing the
collection names as strings.

To see detailed information about each collection, call the `list_collections() <{+api+}/struct.Database.html#method.list_collections>`__
method on your ``Database`` instance. This method returns a
``Vec<CollectionSpecification>`` type. The `CollectionSpecification
<{+api+}/results/struct.CollectionSpecification.html>`__ type
contains fields describing each collection, such as its type and settings.

The following example shows how to print the names of the collections in
a database referenced by the ``db`` variable by using the
``list_collection_names()`` method:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/db-coll.rs
      :start-after: begin-list-coll
      :end-before: end-list-coll
      :language: rust
      :dedent:
   
   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false
   
      ["my_coll", "coll_xyz", ...]

Drop a Collection
-----------------

Dropping a collection permanently deletes all of the data in that
collection. To drop a collection, call the `drop()
<{+api+}/struct.Collection.html#method.drop>`__ method
on your ``Collection`` instance. The following code shows
how to drop a collection referenced by the ``my_coll`` variable:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/db-coll.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-drop-coll
   :end-before: end-drop-coll

.. warning:: Dropping a Collection Deletes Data

   Dropping a collection from your database permanently deletes all
   documents within that collection and all indexes on that collection.
   After you drop a collection, you cannot access or restore any of its data.
