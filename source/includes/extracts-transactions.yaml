   :doc:`Multi-document transactions </core/transactions>` that contain
   read operations must use read preference :readmode:`primary`.

   All operations in a given transaction must route to the same member.

   .. important::

      In most cases, multi-document transaction incurs a greater
      performance cost over single document writes, and the
      availability of multi-document transaction should not be a
      replacement for effective schema design. For many scenarios, the
      :ref:`denormalized data model (embedded documents and arrays)
      <data-modeling-embedding>` will continue to be optimal for your
      data and use cases. That is, for many scenarios, modeling your data
      appropriately will minimize the need for multi-document
      transactions.

   Starting in version 4.0, for situations that require atomicity for
   updates to multiple documents or consistency between reads to multiple
   documents, MongoDB provides :doc:`multi-document transactions
   </core/transactions>` for replica sets.
---
ref: transactions-faq
content: |
   Because a single document can contain related data that would otherwise
   be modeled across separate parent-child tables in a relational schema,
   MongoDB's atomic single-document operations already provide transaction
   semantics that meet the data integrity needs of the majority of
   applications. One or more fields may be written in a single operation,
   including updates to multiple sub-documents and elements of an array.
   The guarantees provided by MongoDB ensure complete isolation as a
   document is updated; any errors cause the operation to roll back so
   that clients receive a consistent view of the document.

   Starting in version 4.0, for situations that require atomicity for
   updates to multiple documents or consistency between reads to multiple
   documents, MongoDB provides :doc:`multi-document transactions
   </core/transactions>` for replica sets, and transactions for sharded
   clusters are scheduled for MongoDB 4.2.

ref: transactions-operations-restrictions

   The following operations are not allowed in multi-document
   transactions:

   - Operations that affect the database catalog, such as creating or
     dropping a collection or an index. For example, a multi-document
     transaction cannot include an insert operation that would result
     in the creation of a new collection.

     The :dbcommand:`listCollections` and :dbcommand:`listIndexes`
     commands and their helper methods are also excluded.
 
   - Non-CRUD and non-informational operations, such as
     :dbcommand:`createUser`, :dbcommand:`getParameter`,
     :dbcommand:`count`, etc. and their helpers.

---
ref: transactions-operations-restrictions-info
content: |

   Informational commands, such as :dbcommand:`isMaster`,
   :dbcommand:`buildInfo`, :dbcommand:`connectionStatus` (and their
   helper methods) are allowed in transactions; however, they cannot be
   the first operation in the transaction.

---
ref: transactions-operations-retry
content: |
   The commit and abort transaction operations are :doc:`retryable write
   operations </core/retryable-writes>`. If the commit operation or the
   abort operation encounters an error, MongoDB drivers retry the
   operation a single time regardless of whether :urioption:`retryWrites` is
   set to ``true``.
---
ref: transactions-operations-crud
content: |
   - You can specify read/write (CRUD) operations on **existing**
     collections.  The collections can be in different databases.

   - You cannot read/write to collections in the ``config``, ``admin``,
     or ``local`` databases.

   - You cannot write to ``system.*`` collections.

   - You cannot return the supported operation's query plan (i.e. ``explain``).

ref: transactions-operations-catalog-tip

   .. tip:: 

      When creating or dropping a collection immediately before
      starting a transaction, if the collection is accessed within the
      transaction, issue the create or drop operation with write
      concern :writeconcern:`"majority"` to ensure that the transaction
      can acquire the required locks.

---
ref: transactions-operations-getMore
content: |

   - For cursors created outside of transactions, you cannot call
     :dbcommand:`getMore` inside a transaction.

   - For cursors created in a transaction, you cannot call
     :dbcommand:`getMore` outside the transaction.

---
ref: transactions-operations-write-concern

   Do not explicitly set the write concern for the operation if run in
   a transaction. To use write concern with transactions, see
   :ref:`transaction-options`.

---
ref: transactions-read-concern-tip
content: |
   In MongoDB 4.0, all multi-documents transactions have ``snapshot`` isolation. In
   future versions of MongoDB, the server will optimize around your specified read
   concern (isolation level).  

   For :readconcern:`"local"` and :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern, MongoDB
   may provide stronger isolation guarantees than specified. If stronger guarantees
   are needed, be explicit as future versions of the server may include
   optimizations that remove stronger isolation guarantees than explicitly
   specified.
