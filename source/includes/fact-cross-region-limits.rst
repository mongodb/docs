For a given region in an |service| project with multi-region clusters
or clusters in multiple regions, you cannot have more than 40 MongoDB
nodes on all other regions in that project. This limit applies
across all cloud service providers.

For example, if an |service| project has 20 nodes in ``Region A`` and 20 nodes
in ``Region B``, you can deploy no more than 20 additional nodes in that
project in any given region. This limit applies even if ``Region A`` and
``Region B`` are backed by different cloud service providers.

For |service| projects where every cluster is deployed to a single region, you
cannot create a multi-region cluster in that project if there are already 40
or more nodes in that single region.
