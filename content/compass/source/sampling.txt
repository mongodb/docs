   :description: Explore how MongoDB Compass uses sampling to efficiently analyze a subset of documents from a collection.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Sampling in |compass| is the selection of a subset of documents from a 
collection for analysis. Analyzing a sample set of data is a common 
statistical analysis technique; the results of analyzing a sample set 
tend to be similar to the results of analyzing an entire data set.

|compass-short| uses sampling for efficiency. Generally, standard 
sample sets can be selected and analyzed in a few seconds. Analyzing 
large samples or entire collections demands significantly more time and 
processing power.

Sampling Method
---------------

|compass| samples 1,000 documents from a collection using the 
:manual:`$sample </reference/operator/aggregation/sample/>` 
operator via the 
:manual:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>`. This 
provides efficient, random sampling without replacement over an entire 
collection, or over the subset of documents specified by a query.
