|service| {+free-clusters+} provide a small-scale development
environment to host your data. {+Free-clusters+} never expire, and
provide access to a :ref:`subset <atlas-free-tier>` of Atlas features
and functionality.

Paid clusters provide full access to |service| features, configuration
options, and operational capabilities. For more information on paid
clusters, including deployment instructions, see
:doc:`/tutorial/create-new-cluster`.

.. note::

   You can deploy only one {+free-cluster+} per |service| project.

Procedure
---------

You can create {+free-clusters+} through the |service| User Interface, 
|service| Administration API, and MongoDB CLI. Select the appropriate 
tab based on how you would like to create the {+free-clusters+}.

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Atlas UI 
      :tabid: ui 

      To create a free cluster through the |service| UI:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-create-cluster.rst

   .. tab:: Atlas Administration API 
      :tabid: api 

      To create a free cluster using the |service| Administration API, 
      send a ``POST`` request to the ``clusters`` endpoint with the 
      ``instanceSize`` set to ``M0``. To learn more about the resource 
      and parameters, see: 

      - :ref:`create-one-cluster-ref`
      - :ref:`create-one-advanced-cluster-ref`

   .. tab:: MongoDB CLI 
      :tabid: mongocli  

      To create a free cluster using the |mcli|, run the ``mongocli 
      atlas quickstart`` command: 

      .. code-block:: 

         mongocli atlas quickstart [options]  

      To learn more about the command syntax and parameters, see 
      `mongocli atlas quickstart <https://docs.mongodb.com/mongocli/stable/command/mongocli-atlas-quickstart/>`__.
