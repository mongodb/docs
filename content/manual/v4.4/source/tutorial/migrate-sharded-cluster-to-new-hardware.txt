MongoDB, refer to the corresponding version of the MongoDB Manual.

This procedure moves the components of the :term:`sharded cluster` to a
new hardware system without downtime for reads and writes.

.. important:: While the migration is in progress, do not attempt to change to the
   :ref:`sharding-internals-config-database`. Do not use
   any operation that modifies the cluster metadata *in any way*. For
   example, do not create or drop databases, create or drop collections,
   or use any sharding commands.

.. _migrate-to-new-hardware-disable-balancer:

Disable the Balancer
--------------------

Disable the balancer to stop :doc:`chunk migration
</core/sharding-balancer-administration>` and do not perform any metadata
write operations until the process finishes. If a migration is in
progress, the balancer will complete the in-progress migration before
stopping.

To disable the balancer, connect to one of the cluster's
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances and issue the following method: [#autosplit-stop]_

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.stopBalancer()

To check the balancer state, issue the :method:`sh.getBalancerState()`
method.

For more information, see :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily`.

Migrate Each Config Server Separately

   :end-before: end-for-migration-steps

.. _migrate-to-new-hardware-restart-mongos:

Restart the ``mongos`` Instances
--------------------------------

With replica set config servers, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances
specify in the :option:`--configdb <mongos --configdb>` or :setting:`sharding.configDB`
setting the config server replica set name and at least one of the
replica set members. The :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances for the sharded
cluster must specify the same config server replica set name but can
specify different members of the replica set. 

If a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance specifies a migrated replica set member in
the :option:`--configdb <mongos --configdb>` or :setting:`sharding.configDB` setting, update
the config server setting for the next time you restart the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

For more information, see :ref:`sharding-setup-start-mongos`.

.. _migrate-to-new-hardware-shards:

Migrate the Shards
------------------

Migrate the shards one at a time. For each shard, follow the appropriate
procedure in this section.

.. _migrate-replica-set-shard:

Migrate a Replica Set Shard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To migrate a sharded cluster, migrate each member separately. First
migrate the non-primary members, and then migrate the :term:`primary`
last.

If the replica set has two voting members, add an :doc:`arbiter
</core/replica-set-arbiter>` to the replica set to ensure the set
keeps a majority of its votes available during the migration. You can
remove the arbiter after completing the migration.

.. _migrate-replica-set-shard-member:

Migrate a Member of a Replica Set Shard
````````````````````````````````````````

1. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process. To ensure a
   clean shutdown, use the :dbcommand:`shutdown` command.

#. Move the data directory (i.e., the :setting:`~storage.dbPath`)
   to the new machine.

#. Restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process at the new
   location.

#. Connect to the replica set's current primary.

#. If the hostname of the member has changed, use
   :method:`rs.reconfig()` to update the :doc:`replica set configuration
   document </reference/replica-configuration>` with the new hostname.

   For example, the following sequence of commands updates the
   hostname for the instance at position ``2`` in the ``members``
   array:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg = rs.conf()
      cfg.members[2].host = "pocatello.example.net:27018"
      rs.reconfig(cfg)

   For more information on updating the configuration document, see
   :ref:`replica-set-reconfiguration-usage`.

#. To confirm the new configuration, issue :method:`rs.conf()`.

#. Wait for the member to recover. To check the member's state, issue
   :method:`rs.status()`.

Migrate the Primary in a Replica Set Shard
``````````````````````````````````````````

While migrating the replica set's primary, the set must elect a new
primary. This failover process which renders the replica set
unavailable to perform reads or accept writes for the duration of the
election, which typically completes quickly. If possible, plan the
migration during a maintenance window.

1. Step down the primary to allow the normal :ref:`failover
   <replica-set-failover>` process.  To step down the primary, connect
   to the primary and issue the either the
   :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` command or the :method:`rs.stepDown()`
   method. The following example shows the :method:`rs.stepDown()`
   method:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.stepDown()

#. Once the primary has stepped down and another member has become
   :replstate:`PRIMARY` state. To migrate the stepped-down primary,
   follow the :ref:`migrate-replica-set-shard-member` procedure

   You can check the output of :method:`rs.status()` to confirm the
   change in status.

.. _migrate-to-new-hardware-enable-balancer:

Re-Enable the Balancer
----------------------

To complete the migration, re-enable the balancer to resume
:doc:`chunk migrations </core/sharding-balancer-administration>`.

Connect to one of the cluster's :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances and pass
``true`` to the :method:`sh.startBalancer()` method: [#autosplit-start]_

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.startBalancer()

To check the balancer state, issue the :method:`sh.getBalancerState()`
method.

For more information, see :ref:`sharding-balancing-enable`.
