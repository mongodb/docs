title: Use the API to create a project.

  Use the {+admin-api+} to send a :doc:`projects 
  </reference/api/groups>` document to create the new project.

  .. code-block:: sh

  curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
       --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
       --request POST "https://{+opsmgr-url+}/api/public/v1.0/groups?pretty=true" \
       --data '
         {
           "name": "{GROUP-NAME}"
         }'

  The |api| returns a document that includes the project's
  ``agentApiKey`` and ``id``.

  Record these values for use in this procedure and in other procedures
  in this tutorial.
---
title: Use the API to create a user in the new project.
stepnum: 3
ref: create-user-via-api
content: |
  Use the ``/users`` endpoint to add a user to the new project.

  The body of the request should contain a
  :doc:`users </reference/api/users>` |json| document with the user's
  information.

  Set the user's ``roles.roleName`` to ``GROUP_OWNER`` and the user's
  ``roles.groupId`` set to the new group's' ``id``.

  .. code-block:: sh

     curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
          --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --request POST "https://{+opsmgr-url+}/api/public/v1.0/users?pretty=true" \
          --data '
            {
               "username": "<new_user@example.com>",
               "emailAddress": "<new_user@example.com>",
               "firstName": "<First>",
               "lastName": "<Last>",
               "password": "<password>",
               "roles": [{
                 "groupId": "{PROJECT-ID}",
                 "roleName": "GROUP_OWNER"
               }]
            }'

title: "(Optional) If you used a global owner user to create the project, you can remove that user from the project."
stepnum: 4
ref: remove-global-owner
content: |

  The user you use to create the project is automatically added to the
  project. If you used a user with the :authrole:`Global Owner` role,
  you can remove the user from the project without losing the ability
  to make changes to the project in the future. As long as you have the
  project's ``agentApiKey`` and ``id``, you have full access to the
  project when logged in as the global owner.

  ``GET`` the global owner's ID. Issue the following command to
  request the project's users, replacing the placeholders with the
  `Variables for Cluster Creation API Resources`_:

  .. code-block:: sh

     curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
          --request GET "https://{+opsmgr-url+}/api/public/v1.0/groups/{PROJECT-ID}/users?pretty=true"

  The |api| returns a |json| document that lists all the project's
  users. Locate the user with ``roles.roleName`` set to
  ``GLOBAL_OWNER``. Copy the user's ``id`` value, and issue the
  following to remove the user from the project, replacing
  ``{USER-ID}`` with the user's ``id`` value and the other placeholders
  with the `Variables for Cluster Creation API Resources`_:

  .. code-block:: sh

     curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
          --request GET "https://{+opsmgr-url+}/api/public/v1.0/groups/{PROJECT-ID}/users/{USER-ID}?pretty=true"

  If |mms| removes the user successfully, the |api| returns the
  |http| ``200 OK`` status code.
