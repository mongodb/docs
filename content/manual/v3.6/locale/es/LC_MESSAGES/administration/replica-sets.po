"The administration of :term:`replica sets <replica set>` includes the "
"initial deployment of the set, adding and removing members to a set, and "
"configuring the operational parameters and properties of the set. "
"Administrators generally need not intervene in failover or replication "
"processes as MongoDB automates these functions. In the exceptional "
"situations that require manual interventions, the tutorials in these "
"sections describe processes such as resyncing a member. The tutorials in "
"this section form the basis for all replica set administration."
