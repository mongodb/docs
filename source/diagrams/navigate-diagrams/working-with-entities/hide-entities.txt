You can show or hide entities in your diagrams. Showing and hiding entities only 
affects the current diagram and does not affect the model. By toggling the visibility 
of entities, you can focus your attention on specific entities and relationships 
and reduce clutter in your diagram.

About this Task
---------------

The visibility of an entity:

- Applies *per diagram*. If you have multiple diagrams, toggling the
  visibility of an entity in one diagram does not affect that entity in
  other diagrams. 

- Persists as part of the diagram. For example, if you hide an entity,
  that entity remains hidden when you reload the diagram.

Changing the visibility of an entity does not affect the placement of
other entities in the diagram.

Changing Visibility Can Affect the Opposite View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changing the visibility of an entity in one view (either the Relational
or MongoDB view) can affect the visibility of entities in the other
view. Specifically:

- When you hide an entity, any entities from the opposite view that are
  linked to the current entity with mapping rules are automatically
  hidden, provided those linked entities are not also linked to other
  visible entities in the original view.

- When you revert the hiding of an entity, any entities from the opposite view 
  that are linked to the current entity with mapping rules are automatically
  unhidden.
