Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official {+extension-long+},
an extension that integrates Hibernate with MongoDB.

The {+orm+} is an object-relational mapping framework for Java applications
that maps Java classes to relational database tables. The {+extension-long+}
adds support for MongoDB, allowing you to represent and interact with MongoDB
data by using {+orm+}'s data mapping and querying capabilities.
