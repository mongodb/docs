To help you better understand the performance of your pipeline, you can view 
your pipeline's explain plan. You can view the explain plan at any point while 
creating or editing your pipeline.

About this Task
---------------

On the :guilabel:`Explain` modal, you can view the explain stages as a 
:guilabel:`Visual Tree`, where each stage of the pipeline appears as a node on 
the tree. Alternatively, you can view the explain details in raw JSON format by selecting

The explain plan includes a :guilabel:`Query Performance Summary` with 
information on the execution of your aggregation pipeline such as:
