Manage Alerts
=============

Overview
--------

You can manage alerts from the :guilabel:`Activity` tab.

.. I've edited the above to distinguish between alerts and alert
   configurations, per Mike Benoit's comments on pull 249 for ticket 2498.

When a condition triggers an alert, users receive the alert at regular
intervals until the alert is resolved or canceled. Users can mark the
alert as acknowledged for a period of time but will again receive
notifications when the acknowledgment period ends if the alert condition
still exists.

Alerts end when the alert is resolved or canceled. An alert is resolved,
also called "closed," when the condition that triggered the alert has been
corrected. |mms| sends users a notification at the time the alert is
resolved.

An alert is canceled if the alert configuration that triggered the alert
is deleted or disabled, or if the target of the alert is removed from the
system. For example, if you have an open alert for "Host Down" and you
delete that host from MMS, then the alert is canceled. When an alert is
canceled, |mms| does not send a notification and does not record an entry in
the activity feed.

Manage Alerts
-------------

View Open Alerts
++++++++++++++++

To view open alerts, click the :guilabel:`Activity` tab and then select
:guilabel:`All Activity`. The :guilabel:`All Activity` page displays a
feed of all events tracked by MMS. If you have open alerts, the page
displays them above the feed.

Filter Activity Feed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can filter the event feed by date.

.. include:: /includes/steps/activity-feed-filter.rst

Download Activity Feed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download the event feed as a CSV file (comma-separated values).

.. include:: /includes/steps/activity-feed-download.rst


Acknowledge an Open Alert
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/steps/alerts-acknowledge.rst

After you acknowledge the alert, |mms| sends no further notifications to the
alert's distribution list until the acknowledgement period has passed or
until the alert is resolved. The distribution list receives *no*
notification of the acknowledgment.

If the alert condition ends during the acknowledgment period, |mms| sends a
notification of the resolution. For example, if you acknowledge a
host-down alert and the host comes back up during the acknowledgement
period, |mms| sends you a notification that the host is up.

If you configure an alert with PagerDuty, a third-party incident
management service, you can only acknowledge the alert on your PagerDuty
dashboard.

Unacknowledge an Acknowledged Alert
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/steps/alerts-unacknowledge.rst

View Closed Alerts
++++++++++++++++++

To view closed alerts, click the :guilabel:`Activity` tab and then select
:guilabel:`Closed Alerts`. The :guilabel:`Closed Alerts` page displays
alerts that users have closed explicitly or where the metric has dropped
below the threshold of the alert.
