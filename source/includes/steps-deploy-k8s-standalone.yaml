          for your |k8s-op-short|. Using two different namespaces
          allows you to delete your standalone or all of the resources
          in the namespace without affecting your |k8s-op-short|.

        - string
        - Version of MongoDB that is installed on this
          standalone.

          The format should be ``X.Y.Z`` for the Community edition and
          ``X.Y.Z-ent`` for the Enterprise edition.
