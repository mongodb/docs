:red:`WARNING:`

The |cmd| command with ``forceJumbo=true`` blocks read
and write operations on the collection.

This option causes the shard to migrate chunks even when they are larger
than the configured chunk size. The collection remains unavailable
for the duration of the migration.

To migrate these large chunks without this long blocking period, see
:ref:`balance-chunks-that-exceed-size-limit` instead.
