  The ``mongo`` shell is packaged with the MongoDB Server
  Community and Enterprise distributions, and is also available
  for users of Atlas as a client-only download.

  MongoDB binaries are located in a directory that starts with
  "mongodb-". You should see a file named ``mongo``, which is
  the shell executable.

  If you do not have ``mongo`` shell installed, follow the
  install directions for your environment.
