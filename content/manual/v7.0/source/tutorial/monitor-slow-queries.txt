The :pipeline:`$currentOp` aggregation stage provides
information on all operations currently running on MongoDB. If
your application is experiencing performance issues, you can
build an aggregation pipeline around this stage to monitor for
slow queries and similar issues.

About This Task
---------------

Database Profilers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This task uses :pipeline:`$currentOp` to identify slow queries
currently running on your application. To find all slow queries
within a specified period, consider using a profiler.

Explain Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This task identifies queries with performance issues. If you
already know which queries have performance issues, see
:ref:`manual-explain-slow-queries` to troubleshoot them.

   .. step:: Retrieve current operations.

      Use the :pipeline:`$currentOp` aggregation stage to
      retrieve current operations from MongoDB:

      .. io-code-block:: 

         .. input::
            :language: javascript

            db.getSiblingDB("admin").aggregate( [
               { $currentOp: { allUsers: true } },
               { $match: { secs_running: { $gt: 2 } } },
               { $sort: { secs_running: 1 } }
            ] )

         .. output::
            :language: javascript

            [
               {
                  "opid": "12345",
                  "secs_running": 5,
                  "active": true,
                  "ns": "sample_mflix.movies",
                  "command": {
                     "find": "movies",
                     "filter": { "title": { "$regex": "The" } }
                  },
                  "planSummary": "COLLSCAN",
                  "locks": { ... },
                  "client": "203.0.113.25:43210"
               }
            ]

      This aggregation pipeline retrieves all current operations
      in the cluster. The :pipeline:`$match` aggregation stage
      then filters the operations to those that have been
      running for more than two seconds. This allows you to
      filter queries that run within a specified period. Adjust
      the value to match your application and database needs.

      The :pipeline:`$sort` stage sorts the results in
      ascending operation time order.

   .. step:: Check for activity.

      View the :data:`currentOp.active` field. If ``currentOp.active`` is
      ``true``, MongoDB indicates that the operation is currently
      running.

      To stop a long running operation, use the
      :method:`db.killOp` method to stop the given
      :data:`~currentOp.opid`.

   .. step:: Check for locks.

      View the :data:`currentOp.waitingForLock` field. If ``currentOp.waitingForLock`` is
      ``true``, another operation running on the server or cluster is blocking the query.
      

      To stop a blocked operation, use the :method:`db.killOp`
      method to stop the given :data:`~currentOp.opid`.

   .. step:: Check the plan summary.

      Check the value in the :data:`currentOp.planSummary`
      field.

      ``IXSCAN``
         Indicates the query performed an index scan.

      ``COLLSCAN``
         Indicates the query performed a full collection scan.
         To correct this, :ref:`manual-create-an-index`.

   .. step:: Explain the query.

      If the :pipeline:`$currentOp` aggregation stage returns a
      query that requires further investigation, use the
      :method:`~db.collection.explain` method to analyze the
      query plan and execution statistics.
