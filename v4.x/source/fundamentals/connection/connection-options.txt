Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about connection, authentication, and driver
options and how to specify them in your Laravel application's database
connection configuration. Connection options are passed to the {+php-library+},
which manages your database connections.

To learn more about the {+php-library+}, see the
`{+php-library+} documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current/>`__.

This guide covers the following topics:

Connection and Authentication Options
-------------------------------------

Learn how to add common connection and authentication options to your
configuration file in the following sections:

- :ref:`laravel-connection-auth-example`
- :ref:`laravel-connection-auth-descriptions`

.. _laravel-connection-auth-example:

Add Connection and Authentication Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify connection or authentication options in your Laravel web
application's ``config/database.php`` configuration file by using one of the
following methods:

- Add the setting and value as an array item in the ``options`` array item.
- Append the setting and value as a query string parameter on the connection
  string specified in the ``dsn`` array item.

To specify an option in the ``options`` array, add its name and value as an
array item, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: php
   :emphasize-lines: 6-10

   'connections' => [
       'mongodb' => [
           'dsn' => 'mongodb+srv://mongodb0.example.com/',
           'driver' => 'mongodb',
           'database' => 'sample_mflix',
           'options' => [
               'appName' => 'myLaravelApp',
               'compressors' => 'zlib',
               'zlibCompressionLevel' => 7,
           ],
       ],
   ],

To specify options as parameters in the connection string, use the following
query string syntax formatting:

- Add the question mark character, ``?``, to separate the host information
  from the parameters.
- Add the options by formatting them as ``<option>=<value>``.
- Insert the ampersand character, ``&``, between each option and value pair
  to separate them.

The following setting example shows the connection string parameter syntax:

.. code-block:: php

   'dsn' => 'mongodb+srv://mongodb0.example.com/?appName=myLaravelApp&compressors=zlib',

Option Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes a list of connection and authentication options
and their default values:

.. list-table::

         MongoDB deployment as part of the handshake.
       | Specifying ``appName`` can help you identify activities related
         to that application in the server logs.

   * - **authMechanism**
     - String
     - None
     - Specifies which authentication mechanism to use. If you do not
       specify this option, the driver uses the default authentication
       mechanism. To learn more, see :manual:`Authentication </core/authentication/>`
       in the {+server-docs-name+}.

   * - **authMechanismProperties**
     - String
     - None
     - Specifies more properties related to the authentication mechanism set in
       the ``authMechanism`` option.

   * - **authSource**
     - String
     - See description
     - | Specifies the database used to authenticate.
       | This option defaults to ``admin`` for SCRAM-based authentication
         mechanisms, ``$external`` for the ``MONGODB-X509`` mechanism, and the
         database name or ``$external`` for the ``PLAIN`` mechanism.

   * - **compressors**
     - A comma-separated list of strings
     - None
     - Specifies data compressors that the {+php-library+} uses to reduce the
       amount of network data passed between MongoDB and your application in
       the specified order.

   * - **connectTimeoutMS**
     - Non-negative integer
     - ``10000`` (10 seconds)
     - Specifies the connection timeout, in milliseconds, passed to each
       underlying TCP stream when attempting to connect to the server.

   * - **directConnection**
     - Boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether to directly connect to a single host instead of
       discovering and connecting to all servers in the cluster. To learn more
       about this setting, see :ref:`laravel-direct-connection` in the
       Connection Guide.

   * - **heartbeatFrequencyMS**
     - Integer greater than or equal to ``500``
     - ``10000`` (10 seconds)
     - Specifies the time in milliseconds that each monitoring thread
       waits between performing server checks.

   * - **journal**
     - Boolean
     - ``false``
     - Requests acknowledgment that the operation propagated to the on-disk
       journal.

   * - **localThresholdMS**
     - Non-negative integer
     - ``15``
     - | Specifies the time in milliseconds that the average round-trip time
         between the driver and server can last compared to the shortest
         round-trip time of all the suitable servers.
       | A value of ``0`` indicates no latency window, so only the server with
         the lowest average round-trip time is eligible.

   * - **maxIdleTimeMS**
     - Non-negative integer
     - ``0``
     - | Specifies the time in milliseconds that a connection can remain idle
         in a connection pool before the server closes it.
       | A value of ``0`` indicates that the client does not close idle
         connections.

   * - **maxStalenessSeconds**
     - ``-1``, or any integer greater than or equal to ``90``
     - ``-1``
     - | Specifies the maximum lag, in seconds, behind the primary node
         that a secondary node can be considered for the given operation.
       | This option's value must be at least ``90``, or the operation raises
         an error. A value of ``-1`` means there is no maximum lag.

   * - **maxPoolSize**
     - Non-negative integer
     - ``10``
     - | Specifies the maximum number of connections that the {+php-library+}
         can create in a connection pool for a given server.
       | If you attempt an operation while the value of ``maxPoolSize``
         connections are checked out, the operation waits until an
         in-progress operation finishes and the connection returns to the pool.

   * - **minPoolSize**
     - Non-negative integer
     - ``0``
     - | Specifies the minimum number of connections available in a server's
         connection pool at a given time.
       | If fewer than ``minPoolSize`` connections are in the pool,
         the server adds connections in the background up to the value of ``minPoolSize``.

   * - **readConcernLevel**
     - String
     - None
     - Specifies the default read concern for operations performed by the
       {+php-library+}.
       To learn more, see :manual:`Read Concern </reference/read-concern/>` in the {+server-docs-name+}.

   * - **readPreference**
     - String
     - ``primary``
     - Specifies how the {+php-library+} routes a read operation to replica set
       members.
       To learn more, see :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference>` in the {+server-docs-name+}.

   * - **readPreferenceTags**
     - A list of comma-separated key-value pairs
     - None
     - Specifies which replica set members are considered for operations.  Each
       instance of this key is a separate tag set. The driver checks each tag
       set until it finds one or more servers with each tag.

   * - **replicaSet**
     - String
     - None
     - Specifies the name of the replica set the {+php-library+} connects to.

   * - **retryReads**
     - Boolean
     - ``true``
     - Specifies whether the {+php-library+} retries a read operation if the operation fails.

   * - **serverSelectionTimeoutMS**
     - Non-negative integer
     - ``30000`` (30 seconds)
     - Specifies the time in milliseconds that {+php-library+} waits to
       select a server for an operation before timing out.

   * - **tls**
     - Boolean
     - ``false``
     - | Specifies the TLS configuration for the {+php-library+} to use in its
         connections with the server.
       | By default, TLS is off.

   * - **tlsAllowInvalidCertificates**
     - Boolean
     - ``false``
     - | Specifies whether the {+php-library+} returns an error if the server
         presents an invalid certificate.
       | We recommend setting this option to ``true`` only in testing
         environments to avoid creating security vulnerabilities in your
         application.

   * - **tlsCAFile**
     - String
     - See description
     - | Specifies the path to the certificate authority (CA) file that
         the {+php-library+} uses for TLS.
       | If you do not specify this option, the driver uses the Mozilla
         root certificates from the ``webpki-roots`` crate.

   * - **tlsCertificateKeyFile**
     - String
     - None
     - | Specifies the path to the certificate file that {+php-library+}
         presents to the server to verify its identity.
       | If you do not set this option, the {+php-library+} does not
         attempt to verify its identity with the server.

   * - **tlsInsecure**
     - Boolean
     - ``false``
     - | Specifies whether the {+php-library+} returns an error if the server
         presents an invalid certificate.
       | We recommend setting this option to ``true`` only in testing
         environments to avoid creating security vulnerabilities in your
         application.

   * - **w**
     - Non-negative integer or string
     - None
     - | Requests acknowledgment that the operation has propagated to a
         specific number or variety of servers.
       | To learn more, see :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern>`
         in the {+server-docs-name+}.

   * - **wTimeoutMS**
     - Non-negative integer
     - No timeout
     - Specifies a time limit, in milliseconds, of the write concern.
       If an operation has not propagated to the requested level within the
       time limit, the {+php-library+} raises an error.

   * - **zlibCompressionLevel**
     - Integer between ``-1`` and ``9`` (inclusive)
     - ``-1``
     - | Specifies the level field of the ``zlib`` compression if you use that compressor.
       | Setting a value of ``-1`` selects the default compression level (``6``).
       | Setting a value of ``0`` specifies no compression, and setting
         a value of ``9`` specifies maximum compression.

To see a full list of connection options, see the :manual:`Connection String Options
</reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options>` section of the
Connection Strings guide in the {+server-docs-name+}. Select ``PHP`` from the
:guilabel:`Select your language` dropdown menu on the right side of the page.

.. _laravel-driver-options:

Driver Connection Options
-------------------------

Driver options modify the behavior of the {+php-library+}, which manages
connections and all operations between a Laravel application and MongoDB.

You can specify driver options in your Laravel web application's
``config/database.php`` configuration file. To add driver options,
add the setting and value as an array item in the ``driver_options`` array
item, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: php
   :emphasize-lines: 6-9

   'connections' => [
       'mongodb' => [
           'dsn' => 'mongodb+srv://mongodb0.example.com/',
           'driver' => 'mongodb',
           'database' => 'sample_mflix',
           'driver_options' => [
               'serverApi' => 1,
               'allow_invalid_hostname' => false,
           ],
       ],
   ]

See the `$driverOptions: array <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current/reference/method/MongoDBClient__construct/#parameters>`__
section of the {+php-library+} documentation for a list of driver options.
