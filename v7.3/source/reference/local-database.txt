======================
The ``local`` Database
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol






Overview
--------

Every :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance has its own ``local`` database, which
stores data used in the replication process, and other
instance-specific data. The ``local`` database is invisible to
replication: collections in the ``local`` database are not replicated.


Collections on all ``mongod`` Instances
---------------------------------------

.. data:: local.startup_log

   On startup, each :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance inserts a document into
   :data:`~local.startup_log` with diagnostic information about the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance itself and host
   information. :data:`~local.startup_log` is a capped
   collection. This information is primarily useful for diagnostic
   purposes.

   For example, the following is a prototype of a document from the
   :data:`~local.startup_log` collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "_id" : "<string>",
        "hostname" : "<string>",
        "startTime" : ISODate("<date>"),
        "startTimeLocal" : "<string>",
        "cmdLine" : {
              "dbpath" : "<path>",
              "<option>" : <value>
        },
        "pid" : <number>,
        "buildinfo" : {
              "version" : "<string>",
              "gitVersion" : "<string>",
              "sysInfo" : "<string>",
              "loaderFlags" : "<string>",
              "compilerFlags" : "<string>",
              "allocator" : "<string>",
              "versionArray" : [ <num>, <num>, <...> ],
              "javascriptEngine" : "<string>",
              "bits" : <number>,
              "debug" : <boolean>,
              "maxBsonObjectSize" : <number>
        }
      }

   Documents in the :data:`~local.startup_log` collection contain the
   following fields:

   .. data:: local.startup_log._id

      Includes the system hostname and a millisecond epoch value.

   .. data:: local.startup_log.hostname

      The system's hostname.

   .. data:: local.startup_log.startTime

      A UTC :term:`ISODate` value that reflects when the server started.

   .. data:: local.startup_log.startTimeLocal

      A string that reports the :data:`~local.startup_log.startTime`
      in the system's local time zone.

   .. data:: local.startup_log.cmdLine

      An embedded document that reports the :binary:`~bin.mongod` runtime
      options and their values.

   .. data:: local.startup_log.pid

      The process identifier for this process.

   .. data:: local.startup_log.buildinfo

      An embedded document that reports information about the build
      environment and settings used to compile this
      :binary:`~bin.mongod`. This is the same output as
      :dbcommand:`buildInfo`. See :data:`buildInfo`.

Collections on Replica Set Members
----------------------------------

.. data:: local.system.replset

   :data:`local.system.replset` holds the replica set's configuration
   object as its single document. To view the object's configuration
   information, issue :method:`rs.conf()` from :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.
   You can also query this collection directly.

.. data:: local.oplog.rs

   :data:`local.oplog.rs` is the capped collection that holds the
   :term:`oplog`. You set its size at creation using the
   :setting:`~replication.oplogSizeMB` setting. To resize the oplog
   after replica set initiation, use the
   :doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size` procedure. For additional
   information, see the :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing` section.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-oplog-size.rst

   Starting in MongoDB 5.0, it is no longer possible to perform manual
   write operations to the :ref:`oplog <replica-set-oplog>` on a
   cluster running as a :ref:`replica set <replication>`. Performing
   write operations to the oplog when running as a
   :term:`standalone instance <standalone>` should only be done with
   guidance from MongoDB Support.

.. data:: local.replset.minvalid

   This contains an object used internally by replica sets to track replication
   status.


Restrictions
------------

Multi-Document Transactions on ``local``
  You cannot perform read/write operations to the collections in the
  ``local`` database inside a 
  :ref:`multi-document transaction <transactions>`.

Retryable Writes against ``local``
  You cannot perform write operations to collections in the ``local``
  database with :ref:`retryable writes <retryable-writes>` enabled.

  .. important::

     The official MongoDB drivers enable retryable writes by
     default. Applications which write to the ``local`` database
     will encounter write errors *unless* retryable writes are explicitly 
     disabled.

     To disable retryable writes, specify
     :urioption:`retryWrites=false <retryWrites>` in the 
     :ref:`connection string <mongodb-uri>` for the MongoDB cluster.
