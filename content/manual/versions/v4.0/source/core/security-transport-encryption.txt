TLS/SSL
-------

MongoDB supports TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer)
to encrypt all of MongoDB's network traffic. TLS/SSL ensures that MongoDB
network traffic is only readable by the intended client.

.. include:: /includes/fact-tls-libraries.rst

MongoDB's TLS/SSL encryption only allows use of strong TLS/SSL ciphers
with a minimum of 128-bit key length for all connections.

Certificates
------------

To use TLS/SSL with MongoDB , you must have the TLS/SSL certificates as
:file:`PEM` files, which are concatenated certificate containers.

MongoDB can use any valid TLS/SSL certificate issued by a certificate
authority or a self-signed certificate. For production use, your MongoDB
deployment should use valid certificates generated and signed by the 
same certificate authority. You can generate and maintain an independent
certificate authority, or use certificates generated by a third-party 
TLS/SSL vendor.

Using a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority allows 
MongoDB drivers to verify the server's identity.

For example, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-clients`.

Identity Verification
---------------------

In addition to encrypting connections, TLS/SSL allows for authentication
using certificates, both for :doc:`client authentication
</core/authentication>` and for :doc:`internal authentication
</core/security-internal-authentication>` of members of replica sets and
sharded clusters.

FIPS Mode
---------

.. include:: /includes/fact-enterprise-only-admonition.rst

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is a U.S. government
computer security standard used to certify software modules and libraries
that encrypt and decrypt data securely. You can configure MongoDB to run
with a FIPS 140-2 certified library for OpenSSL. Configure FIPS to run by
default or as needed from the command line.

For an example, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-fips`.
