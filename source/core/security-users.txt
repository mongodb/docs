To authenticate a client in MongoDB, you must add a corresponding user to
MongoDB.


User Management Interface
-------------------------

To add a user, MongoDB provides the :method:`db.createUser()` method.
When adding a user, you can assign :doc:`roles </core/authorization>` to
the user in order to grant privileges.

.. note::

   The first user created in the database should be a user administrator
   who has the privileges to manage other users. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication`.

You can also update existing users, such as to change password and grant
or revoke roles. For a full list of user management methods, see
:ref:`user-management-methods`.

A user is uniquely identified by the user's name and associated
authentication database. Starting in MongoDB 4.0.9, a users managed by
MongoDB are assigned a unique ``userId``. [#userid]_

.. _authentication-database:
.. _user-authentication-database:

Authentication Database
-----------------------

When adding a user, you create the user in a specific database. This
database is the authentication database for the user.

A user can have privileges across different databases; that is, a user's
privileges are not limited to their authentication database. By assigning
to the user roles in other databases, a user created in one database can
have permissions to act on other databases. For more information on
roles, see :doc:`/core/authorization`.

The user's name and authentication database serve as a unique identifier
for that user. [#userid]_ That is, if two users have the same name but are created
in different databases, they are two separate users. If you intend to
have a single user with permissions on multiple databases, create a
single user with roles in the applicable databases instead of creating
the user multiple times in different databases.

.. [#userid]

   Starting in version 4.0.9, MongoDB associates a user with a unique
   ``userId`` upon creation in MongoDB.
   
   :ref:`LDAP managed users <security-ldap>` created on the LDAP server
   do not have an associated document in the :doc:`system.users
   </reference/system-users-collection>` collection, and hence, do not
   have a :data:`~admin.system.users.userId` field associated with them.

Centralized User Data
---------------------

For users created in MongoDB, MongoDB stores all user information,
including :data:`name <admin.system.users.user>`, :data:`password
<admin.system.users.credentials>`, and the :data:`user's authentication
database <admin.system.users.db>`, in the :doc:`system.users
</reference/system-users-collection>` collection in the ``admin``
database.

Do not access this collection directly but instead use the :ref:`user
management commands <user-management-commands>`.

Sharded Cluster Users
---------------------

To create users for a sharded cluster, connect to the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance and add the users. Clients then
authenticate these users through the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.
In sharded clusters, MongoDB stores user configuration data in the
``admin`` database of the :term:`config servers <config server>`.

.. _shard-local-users:

Shard Local Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

However, some maintenance operations, such as :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned`,
:dbcommand:`compact`, :method:`rs.reconfig()`, require direct connections to
specific shards in a sharded cluster. To perform these operations, you must
connect directly to the shard and authenticate as a *shard local*
administrative user.

To create a *shard local* administrative user, connect directly to the shard
and create the user. MongoDB stores *shard local* users in the ``admin``
database of the shard itself.

These *shard local* users are completely independent from the users added to
the sharded cluster via :binary:`~bin.mongos`. *Shard local* users are local to the
shard and are inaccessible by :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

Direct connections to a shard should only be for shard-specific maintenance and
configuration. In general, clients should connect to the sharded cluster
through the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

.. _localhost-exception:

Localhost Exception
-------------------

The localhost exception allows you to enable access control and then
create the first user in the system. With the localhost exception, after
you enable access control, connect to the localhost interface and create
the first user in the ``admin`` database. The first user must have
privileges to create other users, such as a user with the
:authrole:`userAdmin` or :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role.
Connections using the localhost exception *only* have access to create
the first user on the ``admin`` database.

.. versionchanged:: 3.4

   MongoDB 3.4 extended the localhost exception to permit execution of the
   :method:`db.createRole()` method. This method allows users authorizing via
   LDAP to create a role inside of MongoDB that maps to a role defined
   in LDAP. See :ref:`LDAP Authorization <security-ldap-external>` for more
   information.

The localhost exception applies only when there are no users created in the
MongoDB instance.

In the case of a sharded cluster, the localhost exception applies to each shard
individually as well as to the cluster as a whole. Once you create a sharded
cluster and add a user administrator through the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance,
you must still prevent unauthorized access to the individual shards. Follow one
of the following steps for each shard in your cluster:

- Create an administrative user, or

- Disable the localhost exception at startup. To disable the localhost
  exception, set the :parameter:`enableLocalhostAuthBypass` parameter to ``0``.
