Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to perform aggregations and construct
pipelines by using the {+odm-short+} aggregation builder. The aggregation
builder lets you use a type-safe syntax to construct a MongoDB
**aggregation pipeline**.

An aggregation pipeline is a data processing pipeline that sequentially
performs transformations and computations on data from the MongoDB database,
then outputs the results as a new document or set of documents.

An aggregation pipeline is composed of **aggregation stages**. Aggregation
stages use operators to process input data and produce data that the next 
stage uses as its input.

The {+odm-long+} aggregation builder lets you build aggregation stages and
aggregation pipelines. The following sections show examples of how to use the
aggregation builder to create the stages of an aggregation pipeline:

- :ref:`laravel-build-aggregation`
- :ref:`laravel-aggregation-examples`
- :ref:`laravel-create-custom-operator-factory`

.. tip::

   The aggregation builder feature is available only in {+odm-long+} versions
   4.3 and later. To learn more about running aggregations without using the
   aggregation builder, see :ref:`laravel-query-builder-aggregations` in the
   Query Builder guide.

.. _laravel-build-aggregation:

Create Aggregation Stages
-------------------------

To start an aggregation pipeline, call the ``Model::aggregate()`` method.
Then, chain aggregation stage methods and specify the necessary
parameters for the stage. For example, you can call the ``sort()``
operator method to build a ``$sort`` stage.

The aggregation builder includes the following namespaces that you can import
to build aggregation stages:

- ``MongoDB\Builder\Accumulator``
- ``MongoDB\Builder\Expression``
- ``MongoDB\Builder\Query``
- ``MongoDB\Builder\Type``

This section features the following examples that show how to use common
aggregation stages:

- :ref:`laravel-aggregation-match-stage-example`
- :ref:`laravel-aggregation-group-stage-example`
- :ref:`laravel-aggregation-sort-stage-example`
- :ref:`laravel-aggregation-project-stage-example`

To learn more about MongoDB aggregation operators, see
:manual:`Aggregation Stages </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>` in
the {+server-docs-name+}.

Sample Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following examples run aggregation pipelines on a collection represented
by the ``User`` model. You can add the sample data by running the following
``insert()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin aggregation builder sample data
   :end-before: end aggregation builder sample data

.. _laravel-aggregation-match-stage-example:

Match Stage Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can chain the ``match()`` method to your aggregation pipeline to specify
a query filter. If you omit this stage, the ``aggregate()`` method outputs
all the documents in the model's collection for the following stage.

This aggregation stage is often placed first to retrieve the data by using
available indexes and reduce the amount of data the subsequent stages process.

.. tip::

   If you omit the ``match()`` method, the aggregation pipeline matches all
   documents in the collection that correspond to the model before other
   aggregation stages.

This example constructs a query filter for a **match** aggregation stage by
using the ``MongoDB\Builder\Query`` builder. The match stage includes the
following criteria:

- Returns results that match either of the query filters by using the
  ``Query::or()`` function
- Matches documents that contain an ``occupation`` field with a value of
  ``"designer"`` by using the ``Query::query()`` and ``Query::eq()`` functions
- Matches documents that contain a ``name`` field with a value of
  ``"Eliud Nkosana"`` by using the ``Query::query()`` and ``Query::eq()``
  functions

Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the documents
returned by running the code:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin aggregation match stage
      :end-before: end aggregation match stage

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Janet Doe",
          "occupation": "designer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "541728000000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Eliud Nkosana",
          "occupation": "engineer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "449884800000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Ellis Lee",
          "occupation": "designer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "834019200000"
            }
          }
        }
      ]

.. tip::

   The ``Query::or()`` function corresponds to the ``$or`` MongoDB query operator.
   To learn more about this operator, see :manual:`$or </reference/operator/query/or/>`
   in the {+server-docs-name+}.

.. _laravel-aggregation-group-stage-example:

Group Stage Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can chain the ``group()`` method to your aggregation pipeline to modify the
structure of the data by performing calculations and grouping it by common
field values.

This aggregation stage is often placed immediately after a match stage to
reduce the data subsequent stages process.

This example uses the ``MongoDB\Builder\Expression`` builder to define the group keys in a
**group** aggregation stage. The group stage specifies the following grouping
behavior:

- Sets the value of the group key, represented by the ``_id`` field, to the
  field value defined by the ``Expression`` builder
- References the document values in the ``occupation`` field by calling the
  ``Expression::fieldPath()`` function

Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the documents
returned by running the code:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin aggregation group stage
      :end-before: end aggregation group stage

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        { "_id": "engineer" },
        { "_id": "designer" }
      ]

.. tip::

   This example stage performs a similar task as the ``distinct()`` query
   builder method. To learn more about the ``distinct()`` method, see the
   :ref:`laravel-distinct-usage` usage example.

.. _laravel-aggregation-sort-stage-example:

Sort Stage Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can chain the ``sort()`` method to your aggregation pipeline to specify
the documents' output order.

You can add this aggregation stage anywhere in the pipeline. It is often
placed after the group stage since it can depend on the grouped data. We
recommend placing the sort stage as late as possible in the pipeline to limit
the data it processes.

To specify an sort, set the field value to the ``Sort::Asc`` enum for an
ascending sort or the ``Sort::Desc`` enum for a descending sort.

This example shows a ``sort()`` aggregation pipeline stage that sorts the
documents by the ``name`` field to ``Sort::Desc``, corresponding to reverse
alphabetical order. Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see
the documents returned by running the code:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin aggregation sort stage
      :end-before: end aggregation sort stage

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Janet Doe",
          "occupation": "designer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "541728000000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Francois Soma",
          "occupation": "engineer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "886377600000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Ellis Lee",
          "occupation": "designer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "834019200000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Eliud Nkosana",
          "occupation": "engineer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "449884800000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Bran Steafan",
          "occupation": "engineer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "894326400000"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "_id": ...,
          "name": "Alda Gröndal",
          "occupation": "engineer",
          "birthday": {
            "$date": {
              "$numberLong": "1009843200000"
            }
          }
        }
      ]

.. _laravel-aggregation-project-stage-example:

Project Stage Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can chain the ``project()`` method to your aggregation pipeline to specify
which fields from the documents to display by this stage.

To specify fields to include, pass the name of a field and a truthy value,
such as ``1`` or ``true``. All other fields are omitted from the output.

Alternatively, to specify fields to exclude, pass each field name and
a falsy value, such as ``0`` or ``false``. All other fields are included in
the output.

.. tip::

   When you specify fields to include, the ``_id`` field is included by default.
   To exclude the ``_id`` field, explicitly exclude it in the projection stage.

This example shows how to use the ``project()`` method aggregation stage to
include only the ``name`` field and exclude all other fields from the output.
Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the data returned by
running the code:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin aggregation project stage
      :end-before: end aggregation project stage

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        { "name": "Alda Gröndal" },
        { "name": "Francois Soma" },
        { "name": "Janet Doe" },
        { "name": "Eliud Nkosana" },
        { "name": "Bran Steafan" },
        { "name": "Ellis Lee" }
      ]

.. _laravel-aggregation-examples:

Build Aggregation Pipelines
---------------------------

To build an aggregation pipeline, call the ``Model::aggregate()`` method,
then chain the aggregation stages in the sequence you want them to
run. The examples in this section are adapted from the {+server-docs-name+}.
Each example provides a link to the sample data that you can insert into
your database to test the aggregation operation.

This section features the following examples, which show how to use common
aggregation stages:

- :ref:`laravel-aggregation-filter-group-example`
- :ref:`laravel-aggregation-unwind-example`
- :ref:`laravel-aggregation-lookup-example`

.. _laravel-aggregation-filter-group-example:

Filter and Group Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses the sample data given in the :manual:`Calculate Count,
Sum, and Average </reference/operator/aggregation/group/#calculate-count--sum--and-average>`
section of the ``$group`` stage reference in the {+server-docs-name+}.

The following code example calculates the total sales amount, average
sales quantity, and sale count for each day in the year 2014. To do so,
it uses an aggregation pipeline that contains the following stages:

1. :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage to
   filter for documents that contain a ``date`` field in which the year is
   2014

#. :manual:`$group </reference/operator/aggregation/group/>` stage to
   group the documents by date and calculate the total sales amount,
   average sales quantity, and sale count for each group

#. :manual:`$sort </reference/operator/aggregation/sort/>` stage to
   sort the results by the total sale amount for each group in descending
   order

Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the data returned by
running the code:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-builder-match-group
      :end-before: end-builder-match-group

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        { "_id": "2014-04-04", "totalSaleAmount": { "$numberDecimal": "200" }, "averageQuantity": 15, "count": 2 },
        { "_id": "2014-03-15", "totalSaleAmount": { "$numberDecimal": "50" }, "averageQuantity": 10, "count": 1 },
        { "_id": "2014-03-01", "totalSaleAmount": { "$numberDecimal": "40" }, "averageQuantity": 1.5, "count": 2 }
      ]

.. _laravel-aggregation-unwind-example:

Unwind Embedded Arrays Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses the sample data given in the :manual:`Unwind Embedded Arrays
</reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/#unwind-embedded-arrays>`
section of the ``$unwind`` stage reference in the {+server-docs-name+}.

The following code example groups sold items by their tags and
calculates the total sales amount for each tag. To do so,
it uses an aggregation pipeline that contains the following stages:

1. :manual:`$unwind </reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/>` stage to
   output a separate document for each element in the ``items`` array

#. :manual:`$unwind </reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/>` stage to
   output a separate document for each element in the ``items.tags`` arrays

#. :manual:`$group </reference/operator/aggregation/group/>` stage to
   group the documents by the tag value and calculate the total sales
   amount of items that have each tag

Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the data returned by
running the code:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php

      :end-before: end-builder-unwind
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        { "_id": "school", "totalSalesAmount": { "$numberDecimal": "104.85" } },
        { "_id": "electronics", "totalSalesAmount": { "$numberDecimal": "800.00" } },
        { "_id": "writing", "totalSalesAmount": { "$numberDecimal": "60.00" } },
        { "_id": "office", "totalSalesAmount": { "$numberDecimal": "1019.60" } },
        { "_id": "stationary", "totalSalesAmount": { "$numberDecimal": "264.45" } }
      ]

.. _laravel-aggregation-lookup-example:

Single Equality Join Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example uses the sample data given in the :manual:`Perform a Single
Equality Join with $lookup
</reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#perform-a-single-equality-join-with--lookup>`
section of the ``$lookup`` stage reference in the {+server-docs-name+}.

The following code example joins the documents from the ``orders``
collection with the documents from the ``inventory`` collection by using
the ``item`` field from the ``orders`` collection and the ``sku`` field
from the ``inventory`` collection.

To do so, the example uses an aggregation pipeline that contains a 
:manual:`$lookup </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/>` stage that
specifies the collection to retrieve data from and the local and
foreign field names.

Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the data returned by
running the code:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :start-after: start-builder-lookup
      :end-before: end-builder-lookup
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        { "_id": 1, "item": "almonds", "price": 12, "quantity": 2, "inventory_docs": [
            { "_id": 1, "sku": "almonds", "description": "product 1", "instock": 120 } 
        ] },
        { "_id": 2, "item": "pecans", "price": 20, "quantity": 1, "inventory_docs": [
            { "_id": 4, "sku": "pecans", "description": "product 4", "instock": 70 }
        ] },
        { "_id": 3, "inventory_docs": [
            { "_id": 5, "sku": null, "description": "Incomplete" },
            { "_id": 6 }
        ] }
      ]

.. _laravel-create-custom-operator-factory:

Create a Custom Operator Factory
--------------------------------

When using the aggregation builder to create an aggregation pipeline, you
can define operations or stages in a **custom operator factory**. A custom
operator factory is a function that returns expressions or stages of an
aggregation pipeline. You can create these functions to improve code
readability and reuse.

This example shows how to create and use a custom operator factory that
returns expressions that extract the year from a specified date field.

The following function accepts the name of a field that contains a date
and returns an expression that extracts the year from the date:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start custom operator factory function
   :end-before: end custom operator factory function

The example aggregation pipeline includes the following stages:

- ``addFields()``, which calls the custom operator factory function to extract
  the year from the ``birthday`` field and assign it to the ``birth_year`` field
- ``project()``, which includes only the ``name`` and ``birth_year`` fields in
  its output

Click the :guilabel:`{+code-output-label+}` button to see the data returned by
running the code:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/aggregation/AggregationsBuilderTest.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin custom operator factory usage
      :end-before: end custom operator factory usage

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      [
        {
          "name": "Alda Gröndal",
          "birth_year": 2002
        },
        {
          "name": "Francois Soma",
          "birth_year": 1998
        },
        {
          "name": "Janet Doe",
          "birth_year": 1987
        },
        {
          "name": "Eliud Nkosana",
          "birth_year": 1984
        },
        {
          "name": "Bran Steafan",
          "birth_year": 1998
        },
        {
          "name": "Ellis Lee",
          "birth_year": 1996
        }
      ]
