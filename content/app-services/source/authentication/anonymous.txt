Overview
--------

The Anonymous authentication provider allows users to log in to your
application without providing credentials. Anonymous user objects have a 
unique ID value but no other metadata fields or configuration options.

.. warning::

   An Anonymous user object is not intended to persist data. Once a user logs 
   out, the user cannot retrieve any previous user data.

Potential use cases for anonymous authentication include:

- Authenticating the readers of a blog or news service.

- Allowing end users to try the features of an application before
  registering for an account.

- Simplifying the creation of users while developing and testing the
  client application.

.. _anonymous-authentication-account-linking:

Account Linking
---------------

When someone authenticates anonymously, the provider generates an anonymous 
user object. If the app does not explicitly log this anonymous user out, 
the same anonymous user is reused. The anonymous user persists until either
of these things occur:

- Explicit logout.
- User deletion. Atlas App Services deletes anonymous user objects that have been inactive 
  for 90 days.

To persist data associated with an Anonymous user, you can associate
that existing Anonymous identity with a user account created by a
different authentication provider.

.. important:: Anonymous user expiration
   
   App Services may delete an Anonymous user object that is 90 days old (or
   older). When an account is deleted, it is not recoverable and any
   associated user data is lost. Documents created or modified by the
   user remain unaffected.

Configuration
-------------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::


   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      You can enable the Anonymous authentication provider from the
      App Services UI in the :guilabel:`Authentication` options.

      1. Select :guilabel:`Authentication` in the left sidebar.

      #. Select the "Allow users to log in anonymously" entry of the
         :guilabel:`Provider` list.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Provider Enabled` toggle to move it
         into the "On" state.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Save` button in the lower right of the
         page to save your changes to the App configuration.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Review & Deploy Changes` in the dropdown
         that appears at the top of the page.

      #. Review the changes to your app's configuration and click
         :guilabel:`Deploy` in the lower right of the dialog to
         make your changes available to application users.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      To enable and configure the Anonymous authentication provider with
      the {+cli-ref+}, define a :ref:`configuration 
      object <appconfig-auth>` for it in ``/auth/providers.json``.
      
      Anonymous provider configurations have the following form:

      .. code-block:: json
         :caption: /auth/providers.json
         
         {
           "anon-user": {
             "name": "anon-user",
             "type": "anon-user",
             "disabled": <boolean>
           }
         }
      
      .. include:: /includes/auth-provider-config-same-name-and-type.rst

.. note::

   The anonymous authentication provider does not have any
   provider-specific configuration options.

anonymous authentication, see the documentation for the Realm SDKs:

.. _anonymous-authentication-summary:

Summary
-------

- Anonymous authentication allows users to interact with your
  application creating an identity.
- To persist data from an anonymous session after a user creates an
  identity with a different authentication provider, you can link the
  two identities.
