MongoDB provides several ways to examine the performance of your
workload, allowing you to understand query performance and identify
long-running queries. Understanding query performance helps you build
effective indexes and ensure your application runs critical queries
efficiently.

Identify Slow Queries
---------------------

Use the following methods to identify slow queries that occur on your
deployment.

Performance Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following methods provide overviews of your deployment's
performance. Use these methods to determine if there are performance
issues that need to be addressed:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10 20

   * - Method
     - Availability
     - Description

   * - Use the Atlas Performance Advisor
     - |m10-atlas|
     - The Atlas Performance Advisor monitors slow queries and suggests
       new indexes to improve performance. For more information, see
       :ref:`performance-advisor`.
   
   * - Check ongoing operations in Atlas
     - |m10-atlas|
     - You can use the :ref:`Atlas Real-Time Performance Panel
       <real-time-metrics-status-tab>` (RTPP) to see current network
       traffic, database operations, and hardware statistics.
   
   * - Check ongoing operations locally
     - |both|
     - The :pipeline:`$currentOp` aggregation stage returns information
       on active operations and cursors. Use ``$currentOp`` to identify
       long-running or stuck operations that may be negatively impacting
       performance.

       You can also use the :dbcommand:`top` command to get additional
       operation count and latency statistics..

   * - Check server metrics
     - |both|
     - For Atlas clusters, you can :ref:`view cluster metrics
       <monitor-cluster-metrics>` to identify performance issues.
     
       For self-hosted deployments, the :dbcommand:`serverStatus`
       command provides metrics that can indicate poor performance and
       anomalies for query execution.

   * - View common query shapes
     - |both|
     - The :pipeline:`$queryStats` aggregation stage returns information
       about common :ref:`query shapes <query-shapes>`. ``$queryStats`` provides a holistic
       view of the kinds of queries being run on your deployment.

   * - View index statistics
     - |both|
     - The :pipeline:`$indexStats` aggregation stage returns information
       about your collection's indexes and how often individual indexes
       are used. Use ``$indexStats`` to identify unused indexes that can
       be removed to improve write performance.

Analyze a Slow Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use these methods to analyze a slow query and determine the cause of
poor performance:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10 20

   * - Method
     - Availability
     - Description

   * - Use the Atlas Query Profiler
     - |m10-atlas|
     - The Atlas Query Profiler shows long-running operations and
       performance statistics. For more information, see
       :ref:`profile-database`.

   * - Enable the Database Profiler
     - |both|
     - When enabled, the database profiler stores information about slow
       queries in the :data:`system.profile <<database>.system.profile>`
       collection.

       For more information, see :ref:`database-profiler`.
   
   * - View slow queries in the diagnostic log
     - |both|
     - MongoDB logs queries that exceed the slow operation threshold
       (default 100 milliseconds) in the :ref:`diagnostic logs
       <log-messages-ref>`.

       Check the diagnostic logs to identify problematic queries and see
       which queries would benefit from indexes.

   * - View explain results
     - |both|
     - Query explain results show information on the query plan and
       execution statistics. You can use explain results to determine
       the following information about a query:

       - The amount of time a query took to execute
       - Whether the query used an index
       - The number of documents and index keys scanned to fulfill a
         query

       To view explain results, use the following methods:

       - :method:`db.collection.explain()`
       - :method:`~cursor.explain()` cursor method

       To learn about explain results output, see :ref:`explain-results`
       and :ref:`interpret-explain-plan`.

Perform Advanced Query Analysis
-------------------------------

The following methods are suited for deeper investigation of problematic
queries, and can provide fine-grained performance insights:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10 20

   * - Method
     - Availability
     - Description

   * - View plan cache statistics
     - |both|
     - The :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` aggregation stage returns
       information about a collection's :ref:`plan cache
       <query-plans-query-optimization>`.

       The plan cache contains query plans that the query planner uses
       to efficiently complete queries. Generally, the plan cache should
       contain entries for your most commonly-run queries.
