MongoDB Enterprise Advanced is available on Google Distributed Cloud
air-gapped (GDC air-gapped).

GDC air-gapped is Google Cloudâ€™s Kubernetes-based private cloud. It
enables you to manage infrastructure, services, APIs, and tooling
without a connection to Google Cloud or the public internet. GDC
air-gapped provides compliance with strict data residency and security
requirements for public sector organizations and regulated
enterprises.

Install {+k8s-op-short+} through GDC air-gapped's built-in application
marketplace to manage MongoDB instances in an air-gapped environment
without needing to customize further.

{+k8s-op-short+} manages the namespace that you install
{+k8s-op-short+} in. You can use {+k8s-op-short+}, according to
standard {+k8s-op-short+} documentation, within GDC air-gapped.

To use Enterprise Advanced on GDC air-gapped, you must ensure you have
the correct licenses from MongoDB. For more information, contact
`gcp@mongodb.com <mailto:gcp@mongodb.com>`_.
