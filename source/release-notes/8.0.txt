This page describes changes and new features introduced in MongoDB 8.0.

MongoDB 8.0 is a |lts| Release, which means that it is supported for
both MongoDB Atlas and on-premises deployments. MongoDB 8.0 includes
changes introduced in MongoDB Rapid Releases 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3. To see
changes introduced in these rapid releases, see
:ref:`8.0-rapid-release-changes`. 

To learn more about the differences between |lts| and Rapid releases,
see :ref:`release-version-numbers`. 

Security
--------

OCSF Schema for Log Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, you can specify the {+ocsf+} schema for audit
log messages. The OCSF schema provides logs in a standardized format
compatible with log processors.

To set the schema used for log messages, use the
:setting:`auditLog.schema` configuration file option.

For example log messages in OCSF format, see
:ref:`event-audit-messages-ocsf`.

General Changes
---------------

Compaction Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Background Compaction 
`````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, you can use the new :dbcommand:`autoCompact` command 
to perform background compaction. If enabled, the server attempts to keep free 
space within each collection and index below the specified the 
``freeSpaceTargetMB`` value.

dryRun Option 
`````````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-compact-dryrun.rst 

New Bulk Write Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/bulkWrite-introduction.rst

Read Concern on Capped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/snapshot-capped-collections.rst

DDL Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In MongoDB 8.0, if you add or remove a shard while your cluster executes
a DDL operation (operation that modifies a collection such as
:dbcommand:`reshardCollection`), the operation that adds or removes a
shard only executes after the concurrent DDL operation finishes. 

Default Timeout for Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, you can use the :parameter:`defaultMaxTimeMS`
cluster parameter to specify a default time limit for individual read
operations to complete.

Query Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, use the new query settings instead of
:ref:`index filters <index-filters>`. Index filters are deprecated
starting in MongoDB 8.0. Query settings have more functionality
than index filters. 

- To add query settings, use :dbcommand:`setQuerySettings`.
- To delete query settings, use :dbcommand:`removeQuerySettings`.
- To retrieve query settings, use a :pipeline:`$querySettings` stage in
  an aggregation pipeline.
- To block a :ref:`query shape <queryStats-queryShape>`, see
  :ref:`operation rejection filters <operation-rejection-filters>`.

.. _8.0-tcmalloc-upgrade:

Upgraded TCMalloc 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. NOTE: WE WILL BE ADDING AN INTRO HERE IN DOCSP-39932.
.. INCLUDES KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OLD AND NEW TCMALLOC 
.. PERFORMANCE CHANGES FROM PER-CPU vs PER-THREAD 

The following new :dbcommand:`serverStatus` metrics report information about 
``tcmalloc`` usage:

- :serverstatus:`tcmalloc.usingPerCPUCaches`
- :serverstatus:`tcmalloc.generic.peak_memory_usage`
- :serverstatus:`tcmalloc.tcmalloc.cpu_free`
- :serverstatus:`tcmalloc.tcmalloc.total_bytes_held`
- :serverstatus:`tcmalloc.tcmalloc.cpuCache`
- :serverstatus:`tcmalloc.tcmalloc.cpuCache.N.overflows`
- :serverstatus:`tcmalloc.tcmalloc.cpuCache.N.underflows`
- :serverstatus:`tcmalloc.tcmalloc_derived.total_free_bytes`

tcmallocEnableBackgroundThread Parameter
````````````````````````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, the :parameter:`tcmallocEnableBackgroundThread` is 
enabled by default. This allows MongoDB to periodically release memory back to 
the operating system.
