Overview
--------

While :term:`replica sets <replica set>` provide basic protection
against single-instance failure, replica sets whose members are all
located in a single data center are susceptible to data center
failures. Power outages, network interruptions, and natural disasters
are all issues that can affect replica sets whose members are located
in a single facility.

Distributing replica set members across geographically distinct data
centers adds redundancy and provides fault tolerance if one of the data
centers is unavailable.

Distribution of the Members
---------------------------

To protect your data in case of a data center failure, keep at least
one member in an alternate data center. If possible, use an odd number
of data centers, and choose a distribution of members that maximizes
the likelihood that even with a loss of a data center, the remaining
replica set members can form a majority or at minimum, provide a copy
of your data.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Three-member Replica Set
````````````````````````

For example, for a three-member replica set, some possible
distributions of members include:

- Two data centers: two members to Data Center 1 and one member to Data
  Center 2. If one of the members of the replica set is an arbiter,
  distribute the arbiter to Data Center 1 with a data-bearing member.

  - If Data Center 1 goes down, the replica set becomes read-only.

  - If Data Center 2 goes down, the replica set remains writeable as
    the members in Data Center 1 can hold an election.


- Three data centers: one members to Data Center 1, one member to Data
  Center 2, and one member to Data Center 3.

  - If any Data Center goes down, the replica set remains writeable as
    the remaining members can hold an election.

Five-member Replica Set
```````````````````````

For a replica set with 5 members, some possible
distributions of members include:

- Two data centers: three members to Data Center 1 and two members to
  Data Center 2.

  - If Data Center 1 goes down, the replica set becomes read-only.

  - If Data Center 2 goes down, the replica set remains writeable as
    the members in Data Center 1 can create a majority.


- Three data centers: two member to Data Center 1, two members to Data
  Center 2, and one member to site Data Center 3.

  - If any Data Center goes down, the replica set remains writeable as
    the remaining members can hold an election.

For example, the following 5 member replica set distributes its members
across three data centers.

Electability of Members
-----------------------

Some members of the replica set, such as members that have networking
restraint or limited resources, should not be able to become primary in
a :term:`failover`. Configure members that should not become primary to
have :ref:`priority 0 <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`. 

In some cases, you may prefer that the members in one data center be
elected primary before the members in the other data centers. You can
modify the :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` of the members such that the
members in the one data center has higher
:rsconf:`~members[n].priority` than the members in the other data
centers.

In the following example, the replica set members in
Data Center 1 have a higher priority than the members in Data Center 2
and 3; the members in Data Center 2 have a higher priority than the
member in Data Center 3:

Connectivity
------------

Verify that your network configuration allows communication among all
members; i.e. each member must be able to connect to every other member.
