#~ msgid ""
#~ "Sharding is the process of storing "
#~ "data records across multiple machines "
#~ "and is MongoDB's approach to meeting "
#~ "the demands of data growth. As the"
#~ " size of the data increases, a "
#~ "single machine may not be sufficient "
#~ "to store the data nor provide an"
#~ " acceptable read and write throughput. "
#~ "Sharding solves the problem with "
#~ "horizontal scaling. With sharding, you "
#~ "add more machines to support data "
#~ "growth and the demands of read and"
#~ " write operations."
