You can construct |fts| queries using the :ref:`$search 
<query-syntax-ref>` aggregation pipeline stage. |fts| provides 
:ref:`operators <operators-ref>` that you can use to perform specific 
types of searches on your collection. When you run a ``$search`` query, 
|fts| performs a full-text search of the indexed fields for data that 
matches your query.

- Enter the term to search in the collection. 
- View your |fts| query syntax, which you can then run in your 
  MongoDB Shell, {+mongosh+}, or export to a programming language.

  You must create |fts| :ref:`indexes <ref-index-definitions>` on the
  collection for all fields that you want to search.

|fts| provides options that allow you to modify the :ref:`score
<scoring-ref>` of returned documents and to :ref:`display the search 
terms in their original context <highlight-ref>`.

You can run queries from {+mongosh+}, from your application using
a driver, or from the |service| :ref:`user interface 
<atlas-search-query-ui>`.

Use the :ref:`explain <explain-ref>` method to return detailed
information about your queries.
