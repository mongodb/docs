=========================
Delete Multiple Documents
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can delete multiple documents from a collection in a single operation
by calling the ``deleteMany()`` method on a ``MongoCollection`` object.

To specify which documents to delete, pass a query filter that matches
the documents you want to delete. If you provide an empty document,
MongoDB matches all documents in the collection and deletes them. While
you can use ``deleteMany()`` to delete all documents in a collection,
consider using the ``drop()`` method instead for better performance.

Upon successful deletion, this method returns an instance of
``DeleteResult``. You can retrieve information such as the number of
documents deleted by calling the ``getDeletedCount()`` method on the
``DeleteResult`` instance.

If your delete operation fails, the driver raises an exception. For more
information on the types of exceptions raised under specific conditions,
see the API documentation for ``deleteMany()``, linked at the bottom of
this page.

Example
-------

The following snippet deletes multiple documents from the ``movies``
collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database. 

The query filter passed to the ``deleteMany()`` method matches all
movie documents that contain a ``rating`` of less than **1.9** in the ``imdb``
subdocument.

When you run the example, you should see output that reports the number of
documents deleted in your call to ``deleteMany()``.
