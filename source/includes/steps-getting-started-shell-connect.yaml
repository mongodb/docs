  This is a unique connection string specific to your |service|
  cluster. |service| replaces the ``username`` of the connection
  string with the username of the database user you created earlier

  You will be prompted to enter the password you specified when you

  You should now be connected to your |service| cluster within the
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. Your terminal should display something
  similar to the following:

  .. code-block:: none
     :copyable: false

  .. admonition:: Connection Troubleshooting
     :class: important

     If you are having trouble connecting to your cluster, double check
     that you have added your IP address to your :ref:`IP access list
     <gswa-access-list>` and that you are specifying the correct
     :ref:`database user credentials <gswa-user>`. If you have
     forgotten your database user credentials, you can always
     :ref:`create a new database user <mongodb-users>`.
