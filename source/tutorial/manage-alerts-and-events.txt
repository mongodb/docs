Overview
--------

The :guilabel:`Activity` page's :guilabel:`Alert Settings` tab displays
all available alerts. From here you can edit, clone, disable, or delete an
alert.

Procedures
----------

Modify an Alert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each alert has a distribution list you can edit, a frequency setting to
control how often MMS will distribute the alert, and a waiting period after an
alert state triggers before sending alert messages at the specified interval.

MMS processes alerts on a 5 minute interval.

.. START-COMMENT

   Per Mike Benoit 12/17/2013, mms-docs Pull 80: The reason for the 5 minute
   minimum is that our alert processing job only executes every five minutes.
   Thus, setting this lower than 5 minutes wouldn't have any impact. This also
   means that only multiples of 5 make sense for this value.

Disable or Re-enable an Alert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you disable an alert, the alert configuration remains visible in a
*grayed out* state. MMS automatically cancels active
alerts related to a disabled alert configuration.
You can reactivate disabled alerts.

For example, if you have an alert configured for *Host Down* and you currently
have an active alert telling you a host is down, MMS automatically
cancels active *Host Down*  alerts if you disable the default
*Host Down* configuration. MMS will send no further alerts
of this type unless the disabled alert is re-enabled.

To disable or enable an alert:

.. include:: /includes/steps/alerts-disable-enable.rst

View Open Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view open alerts, select the :guilabel:`Activity` tab, and then select
the :guilabel:`All Activity` tab. Open alerts appear above the *Feed* section in an
*Open Alerts* section that only appears if there are open alerts. From this
window you can acknowledge an alert and select the duration of the
acknowledgment.

Once a user acknowledges an alert in the interface, MMS sends no
further notifications to the alert's distribution list until the
acknowledgement period has passed.

The distribution list receives *no* notification of alert
acknowledgment.

If you configure an alert with PagerDuty, a third-party incident management
service, you can only acknowledge the alert on your PagerDuty dashboard.
