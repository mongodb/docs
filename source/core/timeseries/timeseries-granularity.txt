====================================
Set Granularity for Time Series Data
====================================

When you create a time series collection, MongoDB automatically creates
a ``system.buckets`` :ref:`system collection 
<metadata-system-collections>` and groups incoming time series data 
into buckets. By setting granularity, you control how 
frequently data is bucketed based on the ingestion rate of your data.

Starting in MongoDB 6.3, you can use the custom bucketing parameters
``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` and ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` to specify bucket
boundaries and more accurately control how time series data is bucketed.

For more information on bucketing, see :ref:`timeseries-bucketing`.

.. note::

   You must be running MongoDB 5.0.1 or later in order to change a
   time series collection's granularity after the collection has been
   created. See :ref:`MongoDB 5.0 known issues
   <5.0-known-issue-granularity>`.

Retrieve the Current Bucketing Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retrieve current collection values, use the
:dbcommand:`listCollections` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { listCollections: 1 } )

For time series collections, the output contains ``granularity``,
``bucketMaxSpanSeconds``, and ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` parameters, if
present.

.. code-block:: javascript
  :copyable: false

  {
      cursor: {
         id: <number>,
         ns: 'test.$cmd.listCollections',
         firstBatch: [
           {
              name: <string>,
              type: 'timeseries',
              options: {
                 expireAfterSeconds: <number>,
                 timeseries: {
                    timeField: <string>,
                    metaField: <string>,
                    granularity: <string>,
                    bucketMaxSpanSeconds: <number>,
                    bucketRoundingSeconds: <number>
                 }
              },
              ...
           },
           ...
         ]
      }
   }


Set the "granularity" Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example sets the ``granuarity`` of a ``weather24h``
collection to ``hours``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection(
       "weather24h",
       {
          timeseries: {
             timeField: "timestamp",
             metaField: "metadata",
             granularity: "minutes"
          },
          expireAfterSeconds: 86400
       }
   )

Using Custom Bucketing Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In MongoDB 6.3 and later, instead of ``granularity``, you can set
bucket boundaries manually using the two custom bucketing parameters.
Consider this approach if you expect to query data for fixed time
intervals, such as every 4 hours starting at midnight. Ensuring buckets
don't overlap between those periods optimizes for high query volume and 
:dbcommand:`insert` operations.

To use custom bucketing parameters, set both parameters to the same 
value, and do not set ``granularity``:

- ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` sets the maximum time between timestamps 
  in the same bucket. Possible values are 1-31536000.

- ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` sets the time interval that determines the 
  starting timestamp for a new bucket. When a document requires a new
  bucket, MongoDB rounds down the document's timestamp value by this
  interval to set the minimum time for the bucket.

For the weather station example, if you generate summary reports every 
4 hours, you could adjust bucketing by setting the custom bucketing 
parameters to 14400 seconds instead of using a ``granularity`` 
of ``"minutes"``:

.. code-block:: javascript
      
   db.createCollection(
      "weather24h", 
      {
         timeseries: {
            timeField: "timestamp",
            metaField: "metadata",
            bucketMaxSpanSeconds: 14400,
            bucketRoundingSeconds: 14400
         }
      }   
   )

If a document with a time of ``2023-03-27T16:24:35Z`` does not fit an
existing bucket, MongoDB creates a new bucket with a minimum time of
``2023-03-27T16:00:00Z`` and a maximum time of ``2023-03-27T19:59:59Z``.

Change Time Series Granularity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can increase ``timeseries.granularity`` from a shorter unit of time
to a longer one using a :dbcommand:`collMod` command.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   db.runCommand( {
      collMod: "weather24h",
      timeseries: { granularity: "seconds" | "minutes" | "hours" }
   } )

If you are using the custom bucketing parameters
``bucketRoundingSeconds`` and ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` instead of
``granularity``, include both custom parameters in the ``collMod``
command and set them to the same value:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( {
      collMod: "weather24h",
      timeseries: { 
         bucketRoundingSeconds: 86400,
         bucketMaxSpanSeconds: 86400 
      }
   } )

You cannot decrease the granularity interval or the custom bucketing
values.

.. note::

   To modify the granularity of a **sharded** time series collection,
   you must be running MongoDB 6.0 or later.
