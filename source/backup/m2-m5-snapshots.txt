|service| takes daily snapshots of ``M2`` and ``M5`` shared-tier
clusters. |service| takes these snapshots automatically starting 24
hours after the time you create your cluster.

|service| always takes ``M2`` and ``M5`` snapshots from a
:term:`secondary` node to minimize performance impact.

|service| retains the last 8 daily snapshots which you can
:ref:`download or restore to an Atlas cluster <m2-m5-restore-snapshot>`.

Snapshot Storage Location
-------------------------

|service| stores ``M2`` and ``M5`` cluster snapshots as per the
following table:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Cluster Location
     - Snapshot Storage Location

   * - Australia
     - Australia

   * - Germany
     - Germany

   * - Hong Kong
     - Australia

   * - India, Singapore, Taiwan
     - Asia

   * - USA
     - USA

   * - All other cluster locations
     - Ireland

Access ``M2``/``M5`` Snapshots
------------------------------

|service| displays existing snapshots on the :guilabel:`Snapshots` page.
To view your snapshots:

1. From the :guilabel:`Clusters` view, click the cluster name.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

|service| displays existing snapshots in the
:guilabel:`All Daily Snapshots` table. From this table, you can
:ref:`restore <m2-m5-restore-project>` or
:ref:`download <restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-download>` your existing snapshots.

Limitations
-----------

- Custom policies are not supported for ``M2`` and ``M5`` cluster
  snapshots. |service| always takes a single daily snapshot at the same
  time, starting 24 hours after the cluster was created.

  If you require finer-grained backups, consider upgrading to an
  ``M10`` or larger cluster tier.

-  On-demand snapshots are not supported for ``M2`` and ``M5`` clusters.

- You cannot restore ``M2`` and ``M5`` snapshots to a sharded cluster.
  You can only restore ``M2`` and ``M5`` snapshots to replica sets.
