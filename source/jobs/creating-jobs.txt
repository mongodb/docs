Sync jobs are the worker processes responsible for transferring your 
data and schemas from a relational database to MongoDB. Create a new 
sync job from the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab.

About this Task
---------------

The URI credentials you provide when creating a sync job do not 
need to be the same as the credentials used when creating your project.

Before you Begin
----------------

- :ref:`Create one or more mapping rules <create-rule-relational>` in your 
  Relational Migrator project.
- Prepare a :ref:`MongoDB URI <rm-mongodb-database-connection-strings>` and
  credentials that have read/write permissions on your destination database.

Steps
-----

#. On the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab, click :guilabel:`Create Sync Job`. 
   Relational Migrator only runs one sync job at a time. If a sync job is in progress, this button is disabled.

#. On the :guilabel:`Connect Source DB` form, enter the connection details 
   to create the JDBC URI for your relational database. 

   2a. Select a database type from the :guilabel:`Database type` drop-down.

   2b. Enter a host IP or DNS name in the :guilabel:`Host` text box. 

   2c. Enter a port number in the :guilabel:`Port` text box. 

   2d. Enter a database name in the :guilabel:`Database` text field.

   Depending on your relational database, this behavior varies:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Database Type
        - Behavior
      * - Oracle 
        - You must enter a database name and a :guilabel:`Service ID` or :guilabel:`SID`.
      * - SQL Server
        - Enter a database name, or leave blank to load all databases.
      * - MySQL 
        - Enter a database name, or leave blank to load all databases.
      * - Postgres 
        - Leaving database name blank loads schemas from the default database.

   2e. Enter a username in the :guilabel:`Username` text box. 

   2f. Enter a password in the :guilabel:`Password` text box. 

   2g. (Optional) Click the :guilabel:`Save a password for this session` checkbox.

   2h. Click the :guilabel:`SSL` toggle switch to enable or disable SSL and select an SSL mode.

   2i. Click :guilabel:`Connect`.

   .. note::

      Connection and SSL details depend on the database type you are connecting to. 
      In addition to the generic connection properties listed above, you may also need
      to select a :guilabel:`Identifier` for Oracle and :guilabel:`Authentication`
      for SQL Server.

   If you want to specify the JDBC URI manually, click the 
   :guilabel:`Enter URI manually` toggle switch on the :guilabel:`Connect SourceDB` 
   form. For details, see :ref:`rm-relational-database-connection-strings`
   .

#. Click :guilabel:`Connect`. 

#. On the :guilabel:`Connect Destination DB` form, input your 
   :guilabel:`MongoDB connection string (URI)`.

   If you leave any of the form fields for :guilabel:`Database`, :guilabel:`Username`, 
   or :guilabel:`Password` blank, the values specified in the URI are used.

#. Click :guilabel:`Connect`.

#. On the :guilabel:`Migration Options` form, select your 
   :guilabel:`Migration Options`:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Migration Option
        - Description
      * - Mode 
        - Defines the type of sync job.
      * - Drop destination collections before migration
        - Boolean. Indicates whether Relational Migrator drops a 
          destination collection before transferring data. 
      * - Stop after errors 
        - Integer. Indicates the number of errors after which Relational 
          Migrator stops the sync job.  
      * - Verify migrated data 
        - Boolean. If true, the sync engine checks the migrated data 
          against the source database. Only supported for snapshot mode.

   Once you have established the database connection and specified the 
   job type on the :guilabel:`Migration Options` form, Relational Migrator
   conducts various checks to ensure that the database is configured 
   correctly. If any configuration is missing, a banner appears indicating
   that the database is not properly configured, with a 
   :guilabel:`GENERATE SCRIPT` button to download a SQL script. 

   This script includes the required configuration statements 
   and additional instructions in the form of comments. 

   .. warning:: 

      Before proceeding with starting a sync job:

      1. Download the script. 
      2. Carefully review its contents.
      3. Execute the statements.
      4. Follow any commented manual steps.

#. Click :guilabel:`Start`.
