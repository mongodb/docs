Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+php-library+} to perform
**transactions**. Transactions allow you to perform a series of operations
that change data only if the entire transaction is committed.
If any operation in the transaction does not succeed, the library stops the
transaction and discards all data changes before they ever become
visible. This feature is called **atomicity**.

In MongoDB, transactions run within logical sessions. A
session is a grouping of related read or write operations that you
want to run sequentially. Sessions enable causal consistency for a group
of operations and allow you to run operations in an **ACID-compliant**
transaction, which is a transaction that meets an expectation of
atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. MongoDB guarantees
that the data involved in your transaction operations remains
consistent, even if the operations encounter unexpected errors.

When using the {+php-library+}, you can create a new session from a
``MongoDB\Client`` instance. Then, you can use the resulting
``MongoDB\Driver\Session`` instance to perform transactions.

.. warning::

   Use a ``Session`` only in operations running on the
   ``Client`` that created it. Using a ``Session`` with a
   different ``Client`` results in operation errors.

Transaction APIs
----------------

In this section, you can learn about the transaction APIs provided by
the {+php-library+}. Before you begin a transaction, you must create a
``Session`` by using the ``MongoDB\Client::startSession()``
method on your ``Client`` instance. Then, you can use either of the
following APIs to perform a transaction:

- :ref:`php-convenient-txn`
- :ref:`php-core-txn`

.. _php-convenient-txn:

Convenient API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+php-library+} provides a **Convenient Transaction API** to manage
the transaction lifecyle. Implement this API by using the
``MongoDB\with_transaction()`` function to run custom callback within a
transaction. The ``with_transaction()`` function performs the following
tasks:

- Starts the transaction
- Handles errors by either ending the transaction or retrying it, such
  as when the operation returns a ``TransientTransactionError``
- Commits the transaction

The :ref:`php-txn-example` section of this guide demonstrates how to use
this API to perform a transaction. 

.. _php-core-txn:

Core API
~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, you can have more control over your transaction lifecyle
by using the methods provided by the ``Session`` class. The
following table describes these methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :stub-columns: 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``startTransaction()``
     - | Starts a new transaction on this session. The session
         must be passed into each operation within the transaction, or
         the operation will run outside of the transaction.
       |
       | You can set transaction options by passing an options parameter.

   * - ``commitTransaction()``
     - | Commits the active transaction for this session. This method returns an
         error if there is no active transaction for the session, the
         transaction was previously ended, or if there is a write conflict.

   * - ``abortTransaction()``
     - | Ends the active transaction for this session. This method returns an
         error if there is no active transaction for the session or if the
         transaction was committed or ended.

.. _php-txn-example:

Transaction Example
-------------------

This example defines a callback function that
modifies data in the collections of the ``bank`` database for a
banking transaction. The code performs the following actions:

- Creates ``Collection`` instances to access the target
  collections.
- Specifies the account number and amount to be transferred between
  accounts.
- Defines the callback function, which receives the ``Session`` instance
  as a parameter.
- Updates the customer's balances to reflect the money transfer.
- Records a receipt of the transaction with a timestamp.
- Prints a message if the transaction committed successfully.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/transaction.php
   :copyable:
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-callback
   :end-before: end-callback

Then, run the following code to perform the transaction. This code
completes the following actions:

1. Creates a session from the client by using the ``startSession()`` method.
#. Calls the ``with_transaction()`` function to manage the transaction,
   passing the session and the callback as parameters.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/write/transaction.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin-txn
      :end-before: end-txn
      :emphasize-lines: 1, 4

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Successfully performed transaction!
