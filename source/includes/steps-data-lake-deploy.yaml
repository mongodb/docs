  Follow the steps in the |service| user interface to create a role and
  policy, then assign it to |service|.

  .. important::

     |service| displays the External ID and the |service| |aws| IAM user :abbr:`ARN 
     (Amazon Resource Name)`for a |data-lake| only once. You must save these values 
     to a secure location to reconfigure your |data-lake|. If you 
     modify your custom |aws| role |arn| in the future, you must update the |aws| 
     trust policy associated with the role.
