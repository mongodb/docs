  If the options in the :guilabel:`For` section are available, you can
  optionally filter the alert to apply only to a subset of the targets.

  The :guilabel:`matches` field can use regular expressions. Regular 
  expressions must match against an entire hostname. For example, to 
  find hostnames involving ``foo`` using a regular expression, you can 
  filter for a hostname that:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 60 40
     :header-rows: 1 

     * - Hostname Description
       - ``matches`` Query

     * - Starts with ``foo``
       - ``foo.*``
       
     * - Ends with ``foo``
       - ``.*foo``
       
     * - Contains ``foo``
       - ``.*foo.*``

  In the :guilabel:`Send to` section, click :guilabel:`Add` to add
  notifications or recipients. To help eliminate false positives, set
  the time to elapse before the condition triggers the alert.

  To test HipChat, Slack, FlowDock, or PagerDuty integration, click the
  :guilabel:`test` link that appears after you configure the
  notification.
