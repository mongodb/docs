      To terminate an |service| {+Serverless-instance+} using the 
      {+atlas-ui+}:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-terminate-atlas-serverless-instance.rst

.. warning::

   If you terminate a {+Serverless-instance+} with associated 
   :ref:`tags <configure-resource-tags>` that don't apply to any other 
   {+database-deployment+}, |service| deletes the tags. You can't 
   restore these deleted tags.

|service| terminates the {+Serverless-instance+} after completing any 
in-progress deployment changes.

|service| bills for the operations performed while the 
{+Serverless-instance+} is active. To learn more about |service|
billing, see :doc:`/billing`.
