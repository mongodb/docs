Multi-factor authentication provides an additional layer of security for
your |mms| account.

Considerations
--------------

.. important::

   If an :authrole:`Organization Owner` enables |mfa|, all members of 
   that organization must also enable |mfa-short| before they can 
   access the organization.

When |mfa-short| is enabled, a user must provide their password as well
as verification from another mechanism.

|mms| provides the following factors for |mfa|:

- Okta Verify Mobile App
- Google Authenticator
- Email

Set Up Backup Multi-Factor Authentication Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Enable a minimum of two methods so that you can still access your 
   account if you lose access to one method. 

While you can set up one, some, or all of the available methods, we 
strongly recommend that you set up at least two methods. When |mms|
requires |mfa|, it offers you the choice of which method to use. If you 
have less than two methods set up, |mms| prompts you to set up 
|mfa| and a backup method at login.

Prerequisites
-------------

Disable Legacy Two-Factor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you currently have :ref:`legacy two-factor authentication
<mms-manage-2fa>` set up for your account, you must disable it before
you set up |mfa|.

To disable legacy |2fa|, navigate to your :guilabel:`User Preferences`
panel.

1. Click on the dropdown menu labeled with your name in the upper right
   corner of the |mms| UI.
#. Click :guilabel:`Legacy 2FA` in the dropdown menu.
#. Click the :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` icon to edit your legacy |2fa|
   settings.

   You must authenticate with an existing authentication method before
   removing an authentication method.
