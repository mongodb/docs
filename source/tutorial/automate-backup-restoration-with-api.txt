To restore a snapshot using the |api|:

1. Find the ID of the snapshot that you want to restore.
2. Create a restore job using that snapshot ID.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must have |api| access. To learn how to get access, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-public-api-access`.

To find and download the snapshot, your |api| Key needs read access to
snapshots in the desired project. Grant the API Key the
:authrole:`Project Read Only` role on the Project that relates to that
snapshot.
