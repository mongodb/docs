Synopsis
--------

This document provides a more in-depth explanation of the internals
and operation of replica set features. This material is not necessary
for normal operation or application development, but may be
useful for troubleshooting, helpful understanding MongoDB's behavior,
or interesting for learning about MongoDB's approach.

Oplog
-----

Replication itself works by way of a special :term:`capped collection`
called the :term:`oplog`. This collection keeps a rolling record of
all operations applied to the primary node. Secondary nodes then
replicate this log by applying the operations to themselves in an
asynchronous process.  Under normal operation, secondary nodes will
reflect writes within one second of the primary. However, various
exceptional situations may cause secondaries lag behind further. See
:term:`replication lag` for details.

Also consider :ref:`oplog sizing <replica-set-oplog-sizing>` for more
information about the oplog.

All members send heartbeats to all other members, and can import
operations to into its oplog from any other member in the
set.

.. In 2.0, replicas would import entries from the member lowest
.. "ping," This wasn't true in 1.8 and will likely change in 2.2.

Implementation
--------------

MongoDB uses :term:`single-master replication` to ensure that the
database remains consistent. However, clients may modify the
:ref:`read preferences <replica-set-read-preference>` on a
per-connection basis in order to distribute read operations to the
secondary members of a replica set. Read-heavy deployments may achieve
greater query volumes by distributing reads to secondary nodes. But
keep in mind that replication is asynchronous; therefore, reads from
secondaries may not always reflect the latest writes to the
primary. See the ":ref:`consistency <replica-set-consistency>`"
section for more about ":ref:`read preference
<replica-set-read-preference>`" and ":ref:`write concern
<replica-set-write-concern>`."

.. note::

   Use :func:`db.getReplicationInfo()` from a secondary node
   and the ":doc:`replication status </reference/replication-info>`
   output to asses the current state of replication, and determine if
   there is any unintended replication delay.

In the default configuration, all have nodes an equal chance of
becoming primary; however, it's possible to set "priorities" that
weight the election. In some architectures, there may be operational
reasons for increasing the likelihood of a specific replica set member
becoming primary. For instance, a node located in a remote data
center should become primary . See: ":ref:`node
priority <replica-set-node-priority>`" for more background on this
concept.

Replica sets can also include nodes with four special
configurations which affect membership behavior in a replica
set. Consider the following node types:

- :ref:`Secondary-only <replica-set-secondary-only-members>` members
  have their "priority" set to 0 and thus not eligible for election as
  primary nodes.

- :ref:`Hidden <replica-set-hidden-members>` members do not appear in the
  output of :func:`db.isMaster()`. This setting prevents clients
  from discovering, and thus potentially queries, the node in question.

- :ref:`Delayed <replica-set-delayed-members>` members lag a fixed period
  of time behind the the primary node. These nodes are typically used
  for disaster recovery scenarios. For example, if an administrator
  mistakenly truncates a collection, and you discover the mistake within
  the lag window, then you can manually fail over to the delayed node.

- :ref:`Arbiters <replica-set-arbiters>` exist solely to participate
  in elections. They do not replicate data from the primary.

In almost every case, replica sets simplify the process of
administering database replication; however, replica sets still have a
unique set of administrative requirements and concerns. Choosing the
right :doc:`system architecture </administration/replication-architectures>`
for your data set is crucial.

Administrators of replica sets also have unique :ref:`monitoring
<replica-set-monitoring>`, and :ref:`security <replica-set-security>`
concerns. The :ref:`replica set functions <replica-set-functions>` in
the :program:`mongo` shell, provide the tools necessary for replica set
administration. In particular use the :func:`rs.conf()` to return a
:term:`document` that holds the :doc:`replica set configuration
</reference/replica-configuration>`, and :func:`rs.reconfig()` to
modify the configuration of an existing replica set.

Elections
---------

When you initialize a :term:`replica set` for the first time, or when any
failover occurs, an election takes place to decide which member should
become :term:`primary`. A primary is the only member in the replica
set that can accept write operations including :func:`insert()
<db.collection.insert()>`, :func:`update() <db.collection.update()>`,
and :func:`remove() <db.collection.remove()>`.

Elections are the process replica set members use to
select the primary in a set. Elections follow after one of two events:
a primary that "steps down" or a :term:`secondary` that
loses contact with a :term:`primary` member. All members have one vote
in an election, and any :program:`mongod` can veto an election. A
single veto will invalidate the election.

An existing primary will step down in response to the
:dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` command, or if it sees that one of
the current secondaries is eligible for election *and* has a higher
priority. A secondary will call for an election if it cannot
establish a connection to a primary member. A primary will also step
down when they cannot contact a majority of the members of the replica
set. When the current primary member steps down, it closes all open client
connections to prevent clients from unknowingly writing data to a
non-primary member.

In an election, every member, including :ref:`hidden
<replica-set-hidden-members>` members, :ref:`arbiters
<replica-set-arbiters>`, and even recovering members get a single
vote. Members will give votes to every eligible member that calls an
election.

A member of the set will veto an election under the following
conditions:

- If the member seeking an election is not a member of the voter's set.

- If the member seeking an election is not up to date with the most
  recent operation accessible in the replica set.

- If the member seeking an election has a lower priority than another member
  in the set that is also eligible for election.

- If the current :term:`primary` member has more recent operations
  (i.e. a higher "optime") than the member seeking election, from the
  perspective of the voting member.

- The current primary will also veto an election if it has the same or
  more recent operations (i.e. a "higher or equal optime") than the
  node seeking election.

.. note::

   Any member of a replica set *can* veto an election, even if they
   are :ref:`non-voting members <replica-set-non-voting-members>`.

The first member to receive votes from a majority of members in a set
becomes the next primary until the next election. Be
aware of the following conditions and possible situations:

- Replica set members send heartbeats (pings) to each other every 2
  seconds. If a heartbeat does not return for more than 10 seconds,
  the other members mark the delinquent member as inaccessible.

- Replica set members only compare priorities with other members of
  the set. The absolute value of priorities does not have any impact on
  the outcome of replica set elections.

  .. note::

     The only exception is that members with a priority of ``0``
     cannot become :term:`primary` and will not seek election. See
     :ref:`replica-set-node-priority-configuration` for more
     information.

- Replica set members cannot become primary *unless* they have the
  highest "optime" of any visible members in the set.

- If the member of the set with the highest priority is within 10
  seconds of the latest oplog entry, then the set will *not* elect a
  :term:`primary` until the member with the highest priority catches up
  to the latest operation.

             set<replica-set-non-voting-members>`",
             ":ref:`replica-set-node-priority-configuration`", and
             ":data:`replica configuration <members[n].votes>`

Syncing
-------

Replica set members sync, or copy :term:`oplog` entries, from the
:term:`primary` or another :term:`secondary` member of the set in
order to remain up to date with the current state of the set.

When a new member joins a set, or an existing member restarts, the new
member waits to receive heartbeats from other members. Then, by
default, a new member will sync from the *the closest* member of the
set that is either: the primary or another secondary with more recent
oplog entries. This prevents two secondaries from syncing from each
other.

In version 2.0, secondaries only change sync targets if the connection
between secondaries drops or produces an error.

For example:

#. If you have two secondary members in one data center, a primary in
   a second facility, *and* you start all three instances at roughly
   the same time (i.e. with no existing data sets or oplog,) both
   secondaries will likely sync from the primary, as neither secondary
   has more recent oplog entries.

   If you restart one of the secondaries, when it rejoins the set it
   will likely begin syncing from the other secondary.

#. If, you have a primary in one facility, and a secondary in an
   alternate facility, and you add another secondary to the alternate
   facility, the new secondary will likely sync from the older
   secondary because this member is closer and has more recent oplog
   entries.
