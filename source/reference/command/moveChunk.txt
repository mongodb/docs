.. dbcommand:: moveChunk

   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` is an internal administrative command that
   moves :term:`chunks <chunk>` between :term:`shards <shard>`. The
   command has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { moveChunk : <namespace> ,
                       find : <query> ,
                       to : <destination>,
                       <options> } )

   :param moveChunk: The name of the :term:`collection` where
                     the :term:`chunk` exists. Specify the 
                     collection's full namespace, including
                     the database name. 

   :param find: A query expression that will select a document within
                the chunk you wish to move. The query need not specify
                the :term:`shard key`.

   :param to: The identifier of the shard, that you want to migrate the
              chunk to.

   :param _secondaryThrottle: Optional. Set to ``false`` by
                              default. Provides :ref:`write concern
                              <write-concern>` support for chunk
                              migrations.

   If you set ``_secondaryThrottle`` to ``true``, during chunk
   migrations when a :term:`shard` hosted by a :term:`replica set`,
   the :program:`mongod` will wait until the :term:`secondary` members
   replicate the migration operations continuing to migrate chunk
   data. You may also configure ``_secondaryThrottle`` in the balancer
   configuration.

   Use the :method:`sh.moveChunk()` helper in the :program:`mongo`
   shell to migrate chunks manually.

   The :ref:`chunk migration <sharding-chunk-migration>` section
   describes how chunks move between shards on MongoDB.

   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` will return the following if another cursor
   is using the chunk you are moving:

   .. code-block:: none

      errmsg: "The collection's metadata lock is already taken."

   These errors usually occur when there are too many open
   :term:`cursors <cursor>` accessing the chunk you are migrating. You
   can either wait until the cursors complete their operation or close
   the cursors manually.

   .. note::

      Only use the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` in special circumstances
      such as preparing your :term:`shard cluster` for an initial
      ingestion of data, or a large bulk import operation. See
      :ref:`sharding-administration-create-chunks` for more information.
