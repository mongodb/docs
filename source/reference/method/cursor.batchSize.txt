cursor.batchSize()
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: cursor.batchSize()

   The :method:`batchSize() <cursor.batchSize()>` method specifies the
   number of documents the cursor returns per batch. Specifying the
   batchSize is a low-level optimization whose effects are not visible
   to the user.

   The :method:`batchSize() <cursor.batchSize()>` method takes the
   following parameter:

   :param size: 
   
          The number of documents to return per batch. The ``size``
          also affects whether to close the cursor after the first
          batch. Refer to the specific driver ``batchSize``
          documentation for the cursor behavior as determined by the
          ``size``.

   .. note::
   
      The actual number of documents in the batch may be smaller as
      determined by the limit or the 4 megabyte size limit of the
      server reply.
      
   Consider the following examples of the :method:`batchSize()
   <cursor.batchSize()>` method in the :program:`mongo` shell:
   
   - Set the number of documents returned by the :method:`find()
     <db.collection.find()>` method to ``10`` per each batch:
     
     .. code-block:: javascript

        var curs = db.animals.find().batchSize(10)
        
     The cursor remains open so that you can iterate through the cursor
     ``curs`` to access all documents in the ``animals`` collection.

   - Set the number of documents returned by the :method:`find()
     <db.collection.find()>` method to ``10`` per each batch and close
     after the first batch:
     
     .. code-block:: javascript

        var curs = db.animals.find().batchSize(-10)

     In the :program:`mongo` shell, the cursor closes after the first
     batch so that you can iterate the cursor only ``10`` times.
