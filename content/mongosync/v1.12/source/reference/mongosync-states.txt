``mongosync`` enters different states depending on the requests it
receives. ``mongosync`` can only be in a single state at a given time.
The current ``mongosync`` states determines which API operations you can
run.

This page describes ``mongosync`` states.

   * - State
     - Description
     - Possible API Operations

   * - .. _c2c-state-idle:

       ``IDLE``
     - ``mongosync`` is initialized and ready for a sync job to
       begin.
     - - ``POST`` :ref:`/start <c2c-api-start>`
       - ``GET`` :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>`

   * - .. _c2c-state-running:

       ``RUNNING``
     - The sync process is currently running. In this state, data is
       initially synced to the destination cluster. Subsequent writes to
       the source cluster are applied to the destination cluster.
     - - ``POST`` :ref:`/pause <c2c-api-pause>`
       - ``POST`` :ref:`/commit <c2c-api-commit>`
       - ``GET`` :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>`

   * - .. _c2c-state-paused:

       ``PAUSED``
     - The sync process is paused. To resume the sync process, send a
       request to the :ref:`/resume <c2c-api-resume>` endpoint.
     - - ``POST`` :ref:`/resume <c2c-api-resume>`
       - ``GET`` :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>`

   * - .. _c2c-state-committing:
   
       ``COMMITTING``
     - The cutover for the sync process has started. The time it takes
       to transition to the ``COMMITTED`` phase depends on
       ``lagTimeSeconds``. To monitor ``lagTimeSeconds`` or to see if
       ``mongosync`` has finished committing, use the :ref:`/progress
       <c2c-api-progress>` endpoint.
     - - ``GET`` :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>`

   * - .. _c2c-state-committed:

       ``COMMITTED``
     - The cutover for the sync process is complete.
     - - ``GET`` :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>`
       - ``POST`` :ref:`/reverse <c2c-api-reverse>`

   * - .. _c2c-state-reversing:

       ``REVERSING``

     - The sync process copies metadata from the destination
       cluster to the source cluster. Then, MongoDB swaps the
       source and destination clusters and resumes applying
       change events.

     - - ``GET`` :ref:`/progress <c2c-api-progress>`
