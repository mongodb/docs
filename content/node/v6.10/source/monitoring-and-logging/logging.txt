  The driver doesn't use the logger in versions 4.0 and later.
  Attempting to use prior logger settings in this version won't print
  anything in the log.

  Instead, see our monitoring guides:

  - :ref:`Command Monitoring <node-command-monitoring>`
  - :ref:`Cluster Monitoring <node-cluster-monitoring>`
  - :ref:`Connection Pool Monitoring <node-connection-pool-monitoring>`

Temporary Alternative
---------------------

We are developing a new logging framework. In the meantime, you can output monitor events
by using the following snippet:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const uri = "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>?writeConcern=majority";
   const client = new MongoClient(uri, { monitorCommands:true });

   client.on('commandStarted', (event) => console.debug(event));
   client.on('commandSucceeded', (event) => console.debug(event));
   client.on('commandFailed', (event) => console.debug(event));
