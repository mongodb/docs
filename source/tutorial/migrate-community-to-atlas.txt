Overview
--------

.. include:: /includes/note-push-pull-migration-deprecation-for-om.rst

If you use :manual:`MongoDB Community Edition </introduction>`
but can't use general :atlas:`Atlas Live Migration </migration-live-atlas-managed/>` 
due to network restrictions, you can migrate your MongoDB deployments to 
|service-short| via |cloud-short|. To live migrate data from 
your MongoDB deployments to clusters in |service-short| using |cloud-short|:

1. Add your deployments to |cloud-short| or |onprem|.
#. Add credentials for Monitoring.
#. Follow the live migration process to |service-short|.

For detailed steps, see :ref:`cc-to-atlas-procedure`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin the live migration process from MongoDB Community 
to |service-short|, you must:

- Have an existing deployment in 
  :manual:`MongoDB Community Edition </introduction>`.

- Start a free trial of
  :cloudmgr:`Cloud Manager </tutorial/getting-started>`.

Considerations
--------------

Credentials for Monitoring 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you add your MongoDB Community deployment to |cloud-short| 
or |onprem|, you need to add credentials for Monitoring only, 
not for Automation or Backup. Adding your deployment for Monitoring 
imports your deployment's metadata into |cloud-short| or |onprem|
to help with the Live Migration process. It does not import your 
deployment's actual data.

To learn more about authentication 
credentials, see :ref:`add-existing-mongodb-processes-auth`.

Setup Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use |cloud-short| to migrate your MongoDB deployments.

.. include:: /includes/note-push-pull-migration-deprecation-for-om.rst

For deployments running MongoDB 6.0.5 or later, you can only use |cloud-short|,
not |onprem|, to monitor them if you want to live migrate (push) them
to |service-short|. You can migrate such deployments to |service-short|
using live migration (pull). For a detailed overview of live migration
options, see :atlas:`Migrate to Atlas </import/>`.
