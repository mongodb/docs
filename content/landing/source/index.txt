Welcome to the MongoDB Docs

.. introduction::

   MongoDB is a document-oriented, operational database built from the ground up as an alternative to the relational database for modern applications.  Unlike relational databases, MongoDB allows developers to store rich JSON-like documents that map naturally to the objects they use in their code:

   .. multi-column::

      .. column::
         .. code-block:: json
            :copyable: false

            {
               firstname: "Bob",
               lastname: "Smith",
               email: "bob@smith.com",
               address: {
                  street: "100 Main St",
                  city: "Anytown",
                  state: "MO",
                  zip: "11111"
               }
            } 


         Which you can retrieve with queries such as:

         .. code-block:: json
            :copyable: false

            users.find({address.zip: "11111"})



      .. column::
         :title: MongoDB also offers

         * Strong consistency with ACID transactions.
         * Modern additional built-in query capabilities such as geospatial search, lexical search, and vector search.
         * Serverless horizontal scaling with geography-aware fault tolerance across all major clouds.
         * Security primitives that allow MongoDB to operate in the most demanding of enterprise environments.
