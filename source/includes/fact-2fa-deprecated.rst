Legacy |2fa| is deprecated. If you currently have legacy |2fa|
enabled you can continue to use it, but it is recommended that you switch
to :ref:`multi-factor authentication <atlas-enable-mfa>`. To use |mfa|,
:ref:`disable legacy two-factor authentication <disable-legacy-2fa>`
and :ref:`enable multi-factor authentication <atlas-enable-mfa>` instead.
