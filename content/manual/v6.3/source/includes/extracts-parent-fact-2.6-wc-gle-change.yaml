  .. versionchanged:: 2.6

     A new protocol for :ref:`write operations
     <rel-notes-write-operations>` integrates write concerns with the
     write operations, eliminating the need for a separate {{gle}}.
     :ref:`Most write methods <write-methods-incompatibility>` now return
     the status of the write operation, including error information.
     In previous versions, clients typically used the {{gle}} in
     combination with a write operation to verify that the write
     succeeded.
