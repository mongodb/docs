Pipeline Operators
------------------

.. note::
   .. include:: /includes/fact-aggregation-types.rst

Pipeline operators appear in an array. Documents pass through the
operators in a sequence.

.. include:: /includes/toc/table-aggregation-pipeline.rst

Expression Operators
--------------------

Expression operators calculate values within the
:ref:`aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference`.

``$group`` Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/toc/table-aggregation-group.rst

Boolean Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These operators accept Booleans as arguments and return Booleans as
results.

The operators convert non-Booleans to Boolean values according to the
BSON standards. Here, ``null``, ``undefined``, and ``0`` values become
``false``, while non-zero numeric values, and all other types, such as
strings, dates, objects become ``true``.

.. include:: /includes/toc/table-aggregation-boolean.rst

Set Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These operators provide operations on sets.

.. include:: /includes/toc/table-aggregation-set.rst

Comparison Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These operators perform comparisons between two values and return a
Boolean, in most cases reflecting the result of the comparison.

All comparison operators take an array with a pair of values. You may
compare numbers, strings, and dates. Except for :expression:`$cmp`,
all comparison operators return a Boolean value. :expression:`$cmp`
returns an integer.

.. include:: /includes/toc/table-aggregation-comparison.rst

Arithmetic Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Arithmetic operators support only numbers.

.. include:: /includes/toc/table-aggregation-arithmetic.rst

String Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

String operators that manipulate strings.

.. include:: /includes/toc/table-aggregation-string.rst

Text Search Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operators to support text search.

.. include:: /includes/toc/table-aggregation-text-search.rst

Array Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operators that manipulate arrays.

.. include:: /includes/toc/table-aggregation-array.rst

Projection Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operators that increase the flexibility within aggregation projection
and projection-like expressions. These operators are available in the
:pipeline:`$project`, :pipeline:`$group`, and :pipeline:`$redact`
pipeline stages.

.. include:: /includes/toc/table-aggregation-projection-expressions.rst

Date Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Date operators take a "Date" typed value as a single argument and return
a number.

.. include:: /includes/toc/table-aggregation-date.rst

Conditional Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/toc/table-aggregation-conditional.rst
