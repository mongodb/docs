Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
of this document, particularly the :ref:`3.0-downgrade-considerations`
and the procedure for :ref:`downgrading sharded clusters
<3.0-downgrade-cluster>`.

Downgrade Recommendations and Checklist
---------------------------------------

When downgrading, consider the following:

Downgrade Path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-3.0-downgrade-path.rst

.. important::

   If you upgrade to MongoDB 3.0 and have run
   :dbcommand:`authSchemaUpgrade`, you **cannot** downgrade to the 2.6
   series without disabling ``--auth``.

Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the downgrade procedures:

- To downgrade sharded clusters, see :ref:`3.0-downgrade-cluster`.

- To downgrade replica sets, see :ref:`3.0-downgrade-replica-set`.

- To downgrade a standalone MongoDB instance, see :ref:`3.0-downgrade-standalone`.

.. note::

   *Optional*. Consider :dbcommand:`compacting <compact>` collections
   after downgrading. Otherwise, older versions will not be able to
   reuse free space regions larger than 2MB created while running 3.0.
   This can result in wasted space but no data loss following the
   downgrade.

Downgrade MongoDB Processes
---------------------------

.. _3.0-downgrade-standalone:

Downgrade a Standalone ``mongod`` Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have changed the storage engine to ``WiredTiger``, change the
storage engine to MMAPv1 before downgrading to 2.6.

.. _3.0-downgrade-mmapv1-standalone:

Change Storage Engine to MMAPv1
```````````````````````````````

To change storage engine to MMAPv1 for a standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance, you will need to manually export and upload the data using
:binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/3.0-change-to-mmapv1.rst

Downgrade Binaries
``````````````````

The following steps outline the procedure to downgrade a standalone
:binary:`~bin.mongod` from version 3.0 to 2.6.

.. _3.0-downgrade-replica-set:

Downgrade a 3.0 Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-change-storage-engine-before-downgrade.rst

.. _3.0-downgrade-repl-set-mmapv1:

Change Storage Engine to MMAPv1
```````````````````````````````

You can update members to use the MMAPv1 storage engine in a rolling
manner.

.. note::

   When running a replica set with mixed storage engines, performance
   can vary according to workload.

To change the storage engine to MMAPv1 for an existing secondary
replica set member, remove the member's data and perform an
:doc:`initial sync </tutorial/resync-replica-set-member>`:

.. include:: /includes/steps/3.0-change-to-mmapv1-replica-set.rst

Repeat for the remaining the secondary members. Once all the secondary
members have switched to MMAPv1, step down the primary, and update the
stepped-down member.

Downgrade Binaries
``````````````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-3.0-downgrade-path.rst

The following steps outline a "rolling" downgrade process for the
replica set. The "rolling" downgrade process minimizes downtime by
downgrading the members individually while the other members are
available:

.. include:: /includes/steps/3.0-downgrade-replica-set.rst

Replica set failover is not instant but will render the set unavailable to
writes and interrupt reads until the failover process
completes. Typically this takes 10 seconds or more. You may wish to
plan the downgrade during a predetermined maintenance window.

.. _3.0-downgrade-cluster:

Downgrade a 3.0 Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requirements
````````````

While the downgrade is in progress, you cannot make changes to the
collection meta-data. For example, during the downgrade, do
**not** do any of the following:

- :method:`sh.enableSharding()`

- :method:`sh.shardCollection()`

- :method:`sh.addShard()`

- :method:`db.createCollection()`

- :method:`db.collection.drop()`

- :method:`db.dropDatabase()`

- any operation that creates a database

- any other operation that modifies the cluster meta-data in any
  way. See :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list of
  sharding commands. Note, however, that not all commands on the
  :doc:`/reference/sharding` page modifies the cluster meta-data.

Change Shards to Use MMAPv1
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To change the storage engine to MMAPv1, refer to the procedure in
:ref:`Change Storage Engine to MMAPv1 for replica set members
<3.0-downgrade-repl-set-mmapv1>` and :ref:`Change Storage Engine to
MMAPv1 for standalone mongod <3.0-downgrade-mmapv1-standalone>` as
appropriate for your shards.

Change Config Servers to Use MMAPv1
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::

   During this process, only two config servers will be running at any
   given time to ensure that the sharded cluster's metadata is
   *read only*.

.. include:: /includes/steps/3.0-change-to-mmapv1-config-server.rst

Downgrade Binaries

The downgrade procedure for a sharded cluster reverses the order of the
upgrade procedure. The version ``v6`` config database is backwards
compatible with MongoDB 2.6.
