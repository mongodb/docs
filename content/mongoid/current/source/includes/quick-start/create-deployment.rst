You can create a free-tier MongoDB deployment on MongoDB Atlas
to store and manage your data. MongoDB Atlas hosts and manages
your MongoDB database in the cloud.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create a free MongoDB deployment on Atlas

      Complete the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>`
      guide to set up a new Atlas account and load sample data into a
      new free-tier MongoDB deployment.

   .. step:: Save your credentials

      After you create your database user, save that user's
      username and password to a safe location for use in an upcoming step.

After completing these steps, you have a new free-tier MongoDB deployment on
Atlas, database user credentials, and sample data loaded into your database.
