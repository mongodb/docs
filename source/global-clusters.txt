Use the following resources to configure and manage your
|global-write-clusters|. For general {+cluster+} configuration, see
:ref:`manage-clusters`.

|service| |global-write-clusters| require that you define single or
multi-region :guilabel:`Zones`, where each zone supports write and read
operations from geographically local shards. You can also 
configure zones that support global low-latency 
secondary reads. To learn more about |global-write-cluster| zones 
and how to configure them, see :ref:`global-writes-zones`.

.. note::

   |service| does not auto-configure or auto-shard collections. You can
   :ref:`shard global collections for global writes
   <de-shard-collection-for-global-writes>`.
   To use |global-write|, sharded collections must meet specific 
   compatibility requirements. To learn more, see
   :ref:`Global Cluster Sharding Reference <global-writes-collections>`.

.. _global-writes-zones:

Global Write Zones and Zone Mapping
-----------------------------------

Each |service| Global {+Cluster+} supports up to nine distinct zones. 
Each zone consists of one :guilabel:`Highest Priority` region
and one or more :guilabel:`Electable`, :guilabel:`Read-only`, or
:guilabel:`Analytics` regions. The available regions depend on
the selected cloud service provider.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Region Type
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Highest Priority`
     - Region where |service| deploys the :term:`primary` replica
       set member for the shard or shards associated with that zone.
       Clients can issue only write operations to the :term:`primary`.

       |service| uses the geographic location of the 
       :guilabel:`Highest Priority` regions to construct a map of
       geographically-near countries and subdivisions. The 
       |global-write| {+cluster+} uses this map for directing write
       operations to the correct zone.

       .. tip::

          To facilitate low-latency local secondary reads of globally
          distributed data, for each zone in the {+cluster+}, add a
          :guilabel:`Read-only` node in the
          :guilabel:`Highest Priority` region of every other {+cluster+}
          zone.

   * - :guilabel:`Electable` 
     - Region where |service| deploys the electable :term:`secondary` 
       replica set members for the shard or shards associated to that 
       zone. :guilabel:`Electable` regions add additional fault 
       tolerance in the event of a partial or total regional outage in 
       the :guilabel:`Highest Priority` region.

   * - :guilabel:`Read-only` 
     - Region where |service| deploys the non-electable 
       :term:`secondary` replica set members for supporting secondary 
       read operations.

   * - :guilabel:`Analytics` 
     - Region where |service| deploys
       :ref:`analytics nodes <analytics-nodes-overview>`. Analytics
       nodes are read-only nodes configured with distinct
       :ref:`replica set tags <replica-set-tags>`. You can use these
       tags to direct queries to specific regions. As a result,
       analytics nodes can help isolate reporting queries from your
       normal operational workload as well as reduce latency for local
       reads.

.. _shard-distribution:

Shard Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each shard associated to a zone, |service| distributes the
shard nodes across the configured regions. While |service| allows
more than one shard per zone, users should instead consider 
creating additional zones to address high user volume in a concentrated
geographic area.

.. note::
   
   |service| supports up to :ref:`50 shards per sharded cluster 
   <can-i-deploy-more-than-50-shards>`
   regardless of the number of zones. If you have requirements
   for more shards in your |global-write-cluster|, click 
   :guilabel:`Support` from the {+atlas-ui+} to contact support.

The |service| {+cluster+} builder includes templates for automatically
configuring |global-write| zones for the |global-write-cluster|. 
Each template provides a visual description of the {+cluster+} zone
configuration, including estimates of geographic latency and coverage.

.. _zone-config:

Configure Zone Mappings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can configure zone mappings for a |global-write-cluster|, 
you must :doc:`create a Global Cluster </tutorial/create-global-cluster>`.

To configure your existing |global-write-cluster|:

1. Click the ellipses :guilabel:`...` icon for the {+cluster+} you want to modify. 

#. Select :guilabel:`Edit Configuration`. 

#. In the dialog box that appears, complete the steps to
   `configure your zones 
   <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/create-global-cluster/#configure-your-zones>`__.
