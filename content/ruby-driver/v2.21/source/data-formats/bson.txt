Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the BSON data format, how MongoDB
uses BSON to organize and store data, and how to install the BSON
library independently of the {+driver-short+}.

BSON Data Format
----------------

**BSON**, or Binary JSON, is the data format that MongoDB uses to organize
and store data. This data format includes all JSON data structure types and
adds support for types including dates, differently-sized integers (32-bit and 64-bit),
ObjectIds, and binary data. For a complete list of supported types, see the
:manual:`BSON Types </reference/bson-types>` in the {+mdb-server+} documentation.

BSON is not human-readable, but you can use the
{+language+} BSON library to convert it to the human-readable JSON
representation. You can read more about the relationship between these
formats in the :website:`JSON and BSON </json-and-bson>` guide on the
MongoDB website.

Install the BSON Library
------------------------

You can install the BSON library (``bson``) from `Rubygems
<http://rubygems.org>`__ manually or by using the bundler.

Run the following command to install the ``bson`` gem:

.. code-block:: sh

   gem install bson

To install the gem by using bundler, include the following line in your
application's ``Gemfile``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   gem 'bson'

The BSON library is compatible with MRI v2.5 and later and JRuby v9.2
and later.

ActiveSupport
-------------

Serialization for classes defined in Active Support, such as
``TimeWithZone``, is not loaded by default to avoid a hard dependency of
BSON on Active Support. When using BSON in an application that also uses
Active Support, you must require the Active Support code support:

.. code-block:: ruby

   require 'bson'
   require 'bson/active_support'

BSON Serialization
------------------

You can retrieve a {+language+} object's raw BSON representation by
calling ``to_bson`` on the object. The ``to_bson`` method returns a
``BSON::ByteBuffer``.

The following code demonstrates how to call the ``to_bson`` method on
{+language+} objects:

.. code-block:: ruby

   "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day".to_bson
   1024.to_bson

You can generate a {+language+} object from BSON by calling
``from_bson`` on the class you wish to instantiate and passing it a
``BSON::ByteBuffer`` instance:

.. code-block:: ruby

   String.from_bson(byte_buffer)
   BSON::Int32.from_bson(byte_buffer)

Byte Buffers
------------

``bson`` v4.0 introduces the use of native byte buffers in MRI and JRuby
instead of using ``StringIO`` for improved performance.

Write to a Byte Buffer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a ``ByteBuffer`` for writing, instantiate a
``BSON::ByteBuffer`` with no arguments:

.. code-block:: ruby

   buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new

Raw Bytes
`````````

To write raw bytes to the byte buffer with no transformations, use the
``put_byte`` and ``put_bytes`` methods. Each method takes a byte string
as its argument and copies this string into the buffer. The ``put_byte``
method enforces that the argument is a string of length ``1``. ``put_bytes``
accepts any length of strings. The strings can contain null bytes.

The following code demonstrates how to write raw bytes to a byte buffer:

.. code-block:: ruby

   buffer.put_byte("\x00")

   buffer.put_bytes("\xff\xfe\x00\xfd")

.. note::

   ``put_byte`` and ``put_bytes`` do not write a BSON type byte to the
   buffer before writing the byte string. This means that the buffer
   does not information about the type of data that the raw byte string encodes.

Typed Byte Write Methods
````````````````````````

The write methods described in the following sections write objects of
particular types in the `BSON specification
<http://bsonspec.org/spec.html>`__. The type indicated by the method
name takes precedence over the type of the argument. For example, if a
floating-point value is passed to ``put_int32``, it is coerced into an
integer, and the driver writes the resulting integer to the byte buffer.

Strings
```````

To write a UTF-8 string (BSON type 0x02) to the byte buffer, use the
``put_string`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

   buffer.put_string("hello, world")

BSON strings are always encoded in UTF-8. This means that the
argument to ``put_string`` must be either in UTF-8 or in an encoding
convertable to UTF-8 (not binary). If the argument is in an encoding
other than UTF-8, the string is first converted to UTF-8 and then the
UTF-8 encoded version is written to the buffer. The string must be valid
in its claimed encoding. The string can contain null bytes.

The BSON specification also defines a CString type, which is used, for
example, for document keys. To write CStrings to the buffer, use
``put_cstring``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   buffer.put_cstring("hello, world")

As with regular strings, CStrings in BSON must be UTF-8 encoded. If the
argument is not in UTF-8, it is converted to UTF-8 and the resulting string
is written to the buffer. Unlike ``put_string``, the UTF-8 encoding of
the argument given to ``put_cstring`` cannot have any null bytes, since the
CString serialization format in BSON is null-terminated.

Unlike ``put_string``, ``put_cstring`` also accepts symbols and integers.
In all cases the argument is stringified prior to being written to the buffer:

.. code-block:: ruby

   buffer.put_cstring(:hello)
   buffer.put_cstring(42)

Numbers
```````

To write a 32-bit or a 64-bit integer to the byte buffer, use
``put_int32`` and ``put_int64`` methods, respectively. Note that {+language+}
integers can be arbitrarily large; if the value being written exceeds the
range of a 32-bit or a 64-bit integer, ``put_int32`` and ``put_int64``
raise a ``RangeError`` error.

The following code demonstrates how to write integer values to a byte
buffer:

.. code-block:: ruby

   buffer.put_int32(12345)
   buffer.put_int64(123456789012345)

.. note::

  If ``put_int32`` or ``put_int64`` are given floating point arguments,
  the arguments are first coerced into integers and the integers are
  written to the byte buffer.

To write a 64-bit floating point value to the byte buffer, use ``put_double``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   buffer.put_double(3.14159)

Convert Bytes to Strings
````````````````````````

To retrieve the serialized data as a byte string, call ``to_s`` on the
buffer:

.. code-block:: ruby

   buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new
   buffer.put_string('testing')
   socket.write(buffer.to_s)

.. note::

   ``ByteBuffer`` keeps track of read and write positions separately.
   There is no way to rewind the buffer for writing. The ``rewind``
   method affects only the read position.

Read from a Byte Buffer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a ``ByteBuffer`` for reading, or deserializing from BSON,
instantiate ``BSON::ByteBuffer`` with a byte string as the argument:

.. code-block:: ruby

   buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new(string)

You can read from the buffer by using following methods that correspond
to different data types:

.. code-block:: ruby

   buffer.get_byte # Pulls a single byte from the buffer
   buffer.get_bytes(value) # Pulls n number of bytes from the buffer
   buffer.get_cstring # Pulls a null-terminated string from the buffer
   buffer.get_double # Pulls a 64-bit floating point from the buffer
   buffer.get_int32 # Pulls a 32-bit integer (4 bytes) from the buffer
   buffer.get_int64 # Pulls a 64-bit integer (8 bytes) from the buffer
   buffer.get_string # Pulls a UTF-8 string from the buffer

To restart reading from the beginning of a buffer, use ``rewind``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   buffer.rewind

.. note::

   ``ByteBuffer`` keeps track of read and write positions separately.
   The ``rewind`` method affects only the read position.

Supported Classes
-----------------

The following list provides the {+language+} classes that have
representations in the BSON specification and have a ``to_bson`` method
defined:

- ``Object``
- ``Array``
- ``FalseClass``
- ``Float``
- ``Hash``
- ``Integer``
- ``BigDecimal``
- ``NilClass``
- ``Regexp``
- ``String``
- ``Symbol`` (deprecated)
- ``Time``
- ``TrueClass``

In addition to the core {+language+} objects, BSON also provides some special types
specific to the specification. The following sections describe other
types that are supported in the driver.

.. _ruby-bson-binary:

BSON::Binary
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``BSON::Binary`` objects to store arbitrary binary data. You can construct
``Binary`` objects from binary strings, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::Binary.new("binary_string")
   # => <BSON::Binary:0x47113101192900 type=generic data=0x62696e6172795f73...>

By default, ``Binary`` objects are created with BSON binary subtype 0
(``:generic``). You can explicitly specify the subtype to indicate that
the bytes encode a particular type of data:

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::Binary.new("binary_string", :user)
   # => <BSON::Binary:0x47113101225420 type=user data=0x62696e6172795f73...>

The following list provides the valid subtype specifications:

- ``:generic``
- ``:function``
- ``:old``
- ``:uuid_old``
- ``:uuid``
- ``:md5``
- ``:ciphertext``
- ``:column``
- ``:sensitive``
- ``:vector``
- ``:user``

You can use the ``data`` and ``type`` attributes to retrieve a
``Binary`` object's data and the subtype, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: ruby

   binary = BSON::Binary.new("binary_string", :user)
   binary.data
   # => "binary_string"
   binary.type
   # => :user

You can compare ``Binary`` objects by using the ``<=>`` operator, which allows
you to sort objects that have the same binary subtype. To compare ``Binary`` objects,
ensure that you install v5.0.2 or later of the BSON library.

.. note:: BINARY Encoding

   ``BSON::Binary`` objects always store the data in ``BINARY`` encoding,
   regardless of the encoding of the string passed to the constructor:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      str = "binary_string"
      str.encoding
      # => #<Encoding:US-ASCII>
      binary = BSON::Binary.new(str)
      binary.data
      # => "binary_string"
      binary.data.encoding
      # => #<Encoding:ASCII-8BIT>

UUID Methods
````````````

To create a UUID ``BSON::Binary`` (binary subtype 4) from its RFC 4122-compliant
string representation, use the ``from_uuid`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

   uuid_str = "00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff"
   BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str)
   # => <BSON::Binary:0x46986653612880 type=uuid data=0x0011223344556677...>

To stringify a UUID ``BSON::Binary`` to an RFC 4122-compliant representation,
use the ``to_uuid`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

   binary = BSON::Binary.new("\x00\x11\x22\x33\x44\x55\x66\x77\x88\x99\xAA\xBB\xCC\xDD\xEE\xFF".force_encoding('BINARY'), :uuid)
   # => <BSON::Binary:0x46942046606480 type=uuid data=0x0011223344556677...>
   binary.to_uuid
   # => "00112233-4455-6677-8899aabbccddeeff"

You can explicitly specify standard UUID representation in
the ``from_uuid`` and ``to_uuid`` methods:

.. code-block:: ruby

   binary = BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str, :standard)
   binary.to_uuid(:standard)

You can use the ``:standard`` representation only with a ``Binary``
value of subtype ``:uuid``, not ``:uuid_old``.

Legacy UUIDs
````````````

Data stored in ``BSON::Binary`` objects of subtype 3 (``:uuid_old``) can be
persisted in one of three different byte orders depending on the driver
that created the data. The byte orders are CSharp legacy, Java legacy, and Python
legacy. The Python legacy byte order is the same as the standard RFC 4122
byte order. The CSharp legacy and Java legacy byte orders have some of
the bytes in different locations.

The ``Binary`` object containing a legacy UUID does not encode *which* format
the UUID is stored in. Therefore, methods that convert to and from the legacy
UUID format take the desired format, or representation, as their argument.
An application may copy legacy UUID ``Binary`` objects without knowing which byte
order they store their data in.

The following methods for working with legacy UUIDs are provided for
interoperability with existing deployments storing data in legacy UUID formats.
In new applications, use the ``:uuid`` (subtype 4) format
only, which is compliant with RFC 4122.

To stringify a legacy UUID ``BSON::Binary``, use the ``to_uuid`` method
and specify the desired representation. Accepted representations are ``:csharp_legacy``,
``:java_legacy`` and ``:python_legacy``. A legacy UUID ``BSON::Binary``
cannot be stringified without specifying a representation.

.. code-block:: ruby

   binary = BSON::Binary.new("\x00\x11\x22\x33\x44\x55\x66\x77\x88\x99\xAA\xBB\xCC\xDD\xEE\xFF".force_encoding('BINARY'), :uuid_old)
   # => <BSON::Binary:0x46942046606480 type=uuid data=0x0011223344556677...>

   binary.to_uuid
   # => ArgumentError (Representation must be specified for BSON::Binary objects of type :uuid_old)

   binary.to_uuid(:csharp_legacy)
   # => "33221100-5544-7766-8899aabbccddeeff"

   binary.to_uuid(:java_legacy)
   # => "77665544-3322-1100-ffeeddccbbaa9988"

   binary.to_uuid(:python_legacy)
   # => "00112233-4455-6677-8899aabbccddeeff"

To create a legacy UUID ``BSON::Binary`` from the string representation of the
UUID, use the ``from_uuid`` method and specify the desired representation:

.. code-block:: ruby

   uuid_str = "00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff"

   BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str, :csharp_legacy)
   # => <BSON::Binary:0x46986653650480 type=uuid_old data=0x3322110055447766...>

   BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str, :java_legacy)
   # => <BSON::Binary:0x46986653663960 type=uuid_old data=0x7766554433221100...>

   BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str, :python_legacy)
   # => <BSON::Binary:0x46986653686300 type=uuid_old data=0x0011223344556677...>

You can use these methods to convert from one representation to another:

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::Binary.from_uuid('77665544-3322-1100-ffeeddccbbaa9988',:java_legacy).to_uuid(:csharp_legacy)
   # => "33221100-5544-7766-8899aabbccddeeff"

.. _ruby-bson-vector:

BSON::Vector
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in ``bson`` v5.1, you can use the
``BSON::Vector`` type to represent vectors of numeric values.

You can create a ``BSON::Vector`` object to store values of the following
types:

- ``int8``
- ``float32``
- ``packed_bit``

You can use the optional ``dtype`` and ``padding`` attributes to specify
the data type of the vector and the bit padding, respectively.
``BSON::Vector`` itself is a container to hold your array values, type
information, and padding specification. ``BSON::Vector`` objects are
serialized as normal arrays in MongoDB.

The following example demonstrates how to create a ``BSON::Vector`` object:

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::Vector.new([ -0.0016261312, -0.028070757, -0.011342932 ], :float32)

Convert Vectors to Binary
`````````````````````````

You can convert ``BSON::Vector`` and array objects to
:ref:`ruby-bson-binary` objects so they are serialized as BSON binary
vector (subtype 9) instances. Use the ``BSON::Binary.from_vector``
method, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: ruby
   
   vector = BSON::Vector.new([ -0.0016261312, -0.028070757, -0.011342932 ], :float32)
   BSON::Binary.from_vector(vector)

Using the ``BSON::Binary`` type improves storage efficiency. To learn
more, see the `BSON specification <https://bsonspec.org/spec.html>`__.

You can convert a ``BSON::Binary`` to a ``BSON::Vector`` by using the
``BSON::Binary.as_vector`` method.

.. tip:: {+vector-search+}

   To view an example that leverages the ``BSON::Binary`` type
   to perform efficient {+vector-search+} queries, see the :ref:`ruby-avs-examples`.

BSON::Code
~~~~~~~~~~

This type represents a string of JavaScript code:

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::Code.new("this.value = 5;")

BSON::DBRef
~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a subclass of ``BSON::Document`` that provides accessors for the
collection, identifier, and database of the ``DBRef``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::DBRef.new({"$ref" => "collection", "$id" => "id"})
   BSON::DBRef.new({"$ref" => "collection", "$id" => "id", "database" => "db"})

.. note::

   The ``BSON::DBRef`` constructor validates the given hash and raises an ``ArgumentError``
   if it is not a valid ``DBRef``. The ``BSON::ExtJSON.parse_obj`` and
   ``Hash.from_bson`` methods do not raise an error if passed an invalid
   ``DBRef``, and parse a ``Hash`` or deserialize a ``BSON::Document`` instead.

.. note::

   All BSON documents are deserialized into instances of ``BSON::DBRef`` if they are
   valid ``DBRef`` instances, otherwise they are deserialized into
   instances of ``BSON::Document``. This is true even when the
   invocation is made from the ``Hash`` class:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      bson = {"$ref" => "collection", "$id" => "id"}.to_bson.to_s
      loaded = Hash.from_bson(BSON::ByteBuffer.new(bson))
      => {"$ref"=>"collection", "$id"=>"id"}
      loaded.class
      => BSON::DBRef

BSON::Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``BSON::Document`` is a subclass of ``Hash`` that stores all keys as
strings, but allows access to them by using symbol keys.

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::Document[:key, "value"]
   BSON::Document.new

.. note::

   All BSON documents are deserialized into instances of ``BSON::Document``,
   or ``BSON::DBRef``, if they are valid ``DBRef`` instances, even when the
   invocation is made from the ``Hash`` class:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      bson = {test: 1}.to_bson.to_s
      loaded = Hash.from_bson(BSON::ByteBuffer.new(bson))
      # => {"test"=>1}
      loaded.class
      # => BSON::Document

BSON::MaxKey
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``BSON::MaxKey`` represents a value in BSON that always compares
higher than any other value:

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::MaxKey.new

BSON::MinKey
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``BSON::MinKey`` represents a value in BSON that always compares
lower than any other value:

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::MinKey.new

BSON::ObjectId
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``BSON::ObjectId`` represents a 12 byte unique identifier for an object:

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::ObjectId.new

BSON::Timestamp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``BSON::Timestamp`` represents a time with a start and increment value:

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::Timestamp.new(5, 30)

BSON::Undefined
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``BSON::Undefined`` represents a placeholder for a value that is undefined:

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::Undefined.new

BSON::Decimal128
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``BSON::Decimal128`` represents a 128-bit decimal-based floating-point
value that can emulate decimal rounding with exact precision:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Instantiate with a String
   BSON::Decimal128.new("1.28")

   # Instantiate with a BigDecimal
   d = BigDecimal(1.28, 3)
   BSON::Decimal128.new(d)

BSON::Decimal128 and BigDecimal
```````````````````````````````

The ``BigDecimal#from_bson`` and ``BigDecimal#to_bson`` methods use the
equivalent ``BSON::Decimal128`` methods internally. This leads to some limitations
on ``BigDecimal`` values that can be serialized to BSON
and those that can be deserialized from existing ``decimal128`` BSON
values.

Serializing ``BigDecimal`` instances as ``BSON::Decimal128`` instances
allows for more flexibility when querying and performing aggregations in
MongoDB. The following list describes the limitations on ``BigDecimal``:

- ``Decimal128`` has a limited range and precision, while ``BigDecimal`` has no
  restrictions in terms of range and precision. ``Decimal128`` has a max value
  of approximately ``10^6145`` and a min value of approximately ``-10^6145``,
  and has a maximum of 34 bits of precision.

- ``Decimal128`` is able to accept signed ``NaN`` values, while ``BigDecimal``
  is not. All signed ``NaN`` values that are deserialized into ``BigDecimal``
  instances will be unsigned.

- ``Decimal128`` maintains trailing zeroes when serializing to and
  deserializing from BSON. ``BigDecimal``, however, does not maintain trailing
  zeroes and therefore using ``BigDecimal`` may result in a lack of precision.

.. note::

   In BSON library v5.0, ``Decimal128`` is deserialized into ``BigDecimal`` by
   default. In order to have ``Decimal128`` values in BSON documents
   deserialized into ``BSON::Decimal128``, you can set the ``mode: :bson`` option
   when calling ``from_bson``.

JSON Serialization
------------------

Some BSON types have special representations in JSON. The following table
describes the serialization behavior for the specified types when
you call ``to_json`` on them.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - {+language+} BSON Object
     - JSON Representation

   * - ``BSON::Binary``
     - ``{ "$binary" : "\x01", "$type" : "md5" }``

   * - ``BSON::Code``
     - ``{ "$code" : "this.v = 5" }``

   * - ``BSON::CodeWithScope``
     - ``{ "$code" : "this.v = value", "$scope" : { v => 5 }}``

   * - ``BSON::DBRef``
     - ``{ "$ref" : "collection", "$id" : { "$oid" : "id" }, "$db" : "database" }``

   * - ``BSON::MaxKey``
     - ``{ "$maxKey" : 1 }``

   * - ``BSON::MinKey``
     - ``{ "$minKey" : 1 }``

   * - ``BSON::ObjectId``
     - ``{ "$oid" : "4e4d66343b39b68407000001" }``

   * - ``BSON::Timestamp``
     - ``{ "t" : 5, "i" : 30 }``

   * - ``Regexp``
     - ``{ "$regex" : "[abc]", "$options" : "i" }``

Time Instances
--------------

Times in {+language+} have nanosecond precision. Times in BSON
have millisecond precision. When you serialize {+language+} ``Time`` instances
to BSON or Extended JSON, the times are rounded to the nearest millisecond.

.. note::

   Time values are rounded down. If the time precedes the Unix epoch
   (January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC), the absolute value of the time
   increases:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      time = Time.utc(1960, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 999_999)
      time.to_f
      # => -315619199.000001
      time.floor(3).to_f
      # => -315619199.001

Because of this rounding behavior, we recommend that you perform
all time calculations by using integer math, as inexactness of floating point
calculations might produce unexpected results.

.. note::

  JRuby 9.2.11.0 rounds pre-Unix epoch times up rather than
  down. To learn more about this behavior, see the :github:`related
  GitHub issue <jruby/jruby/issues/6104>`. The BSON library corrects
  this behavior and floors the times when serializing on JRuby.

DateTime Instances
------------------

BSON supports storing time values as the number of seconds since the
Unix epoch. {+language+} ``DateTime`` instances can be serialized to BSON,
but when the BSON is deserialized the times will be returned as
``Time`` instances.

The ``DateTime`` class in Ruby supports non-Gregorian calendars. When
non-Gregorian ``DateTime`` instances are serialized, they are first
converted to Gregorian calendar, and the respective date in the
Gregorian calendar is stored in the database.

Date Instances
--------------

BSON supports storing time values as the number of seconds since the
Unix epoch. {+language+} ``Date`` instances can be serialized to BSON,
but when the BSON is deserialized the times will be returned as ``Time``
instances.

When ``Date`` instances are serialized, the time value used is midnight
on the ``Date`` in UTC.

Regular Expressions
-------------------

Both MongoDB and {+language+} provide support for working with regular expressions,
but they use regular expression engines. The following subsections detail the
differences between {+language+} regular expressions and MongoDB regular
expressions.

MongoDB Regular Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB uses `Perl-compatible regular expressions implemented by using
the PCRE library <http://pcre.org/>`__. `{+language+} regular expressions
<http://ruby-doc.org/core/Regexp.html>`__ are implemented by using the
`Onigmo regular expression engine <https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo>`__,
which is a fork of the `Oniguruma <https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma>`__
library.

The two regular expression implementations generally provide equivalent
functionality but have several important syntax differences, which are described
in the following sections.

There is no simple way to programmatically convert a PCRE
regular expression into the equivalent {+language+} regular expression,
as there are currently no {+language+} bindings for PCRE.

Options, Flags, and Modifiers
`````````````````````````````

Both {+language+} and PCRE regular expressions support modifiers. These are
also called "options" in {+language+} contexts and "flags" in PCRE contexts.
The meaning of ``s`` and ``m`` modifiers differs in {+language+} and
PCRE in the following ways:

- {+language+} does not have the ``s`` modifier. Instead, the {+language+} ``m`` modifier
  performs the same function as the PCRE ``s`` modifier, which is to make the
  period (``.``) match any character including newlines. The
  {+language+} documentation refers to the ``m`` modifier as enabling multi-line mode.

- {+language+} always operates in the equivalent of PCRE's multi-line mode, enabled by
  the ``m`` modifier in PCRE regular expressions. In Ruby the ``^`` anchor
  always refers to the beginning of line and the ``$`` anchor always refers
  to the end of line.

When writing regular expressions intended to be used in both {+language+} and
PCRE environments, including {+mdb-server+} and most other MongoDB drivers,
avoid using the ``^`` and ``$`` anchors. The following sections provide
workarounds and recommendations for authoring portable regular
expressions that can be used in multiple contexts.

^ Anchor
````````

In {+language+} regular expressions, the ``^`` anchor always refers to the beginning
of line. In PCRE regular expressions, the ``^`` anchor refers to the beginning
of input by default, and the ``m`` flag changes its meaning to the beginning
of line.

Both {+language+} and PCRE regular expressions support the ``\A`` anchor to refer to
the beginning of input, regardless of modifiers. The following
suggestions allow you to write portable regular expressions:

- Use the ``\A`` anchor to refer to the beginning of input.

- Use the ``^`` anchor to refer to the beginning of line if you set the
  ``m`` flag in PCRE regular expressions. Alternatively, use 
  one of the following constructs which work regardless of modifiers:

  - ``(?:\A|(?<=\n))``: handles ``LF`` and ``CR+LF`` line ends

  - ``(?:\A|(?<=[\r\n]))``: handles ``CR``, ``LF`` and ``CR+LF`` line ends

$ Anchor
````````

In {+language+} regular expressions, the ``$`` anchor always refers to the end
of line. In PCRE regular expressions, the ``$`` anchor refers to the end
of input by default and the ``m`` flag changes its meaning to the end
of line.

Both {+language+} and PCRE regular expressions support the ``\z`` anchor to refer to
the end of input, regardless of modifiers.

The following suggestions allow you to write portable regular expressions:

- Use the ``\z`` anchor to refer to the end of input.

- Use the ``$`` anchor to refer to the beginning of line if you set the
  ``m`` flag in PCRE regular expressions. Alternatively, use
  one of the following constructs which work regardless of modifiers:

  - ``(?:\z|(?=\n))``: handles ``LF`` and ``CR+LF`` line ends

  - ``(?:\z|(?=[\n\n]))``: handles ``CR``, ``LF`` and ``CR+LF`` line ends

BSON::Regexp::Raw
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since there is no simple way to programmatically convert a PCRE
regular expression into the equivalent {+language+} regular expression,
the BSON library provides the ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` class for storing PCRE
regular expressions.

You can create instances ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` by using the regular
expression text as a string and optional PCRE modifiers:

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::Regexp::Raw.new("^b403158")
   # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055df63186d78 @pattern="^b403158", @options="">

   BSON::Regexp::Raw.new("^Hello.world$", "s")
   # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055df6317f028 @pattern="^Hello.world$", @options="s">

The ``BSON::Regexp`` module is included in the {+language+} ``Regexp``
class, such that the ``BSON::`` prefix can be omitted:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Regexp::Raw.new("^b403158")
   # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055df63186d78 @pattern="^b403158", @options="">

   Regexp::Raw.new("^Hello.world$", "s")
   # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055df6317f028 @pattern="^Hello.world$", @options="s">

Regular Expression Conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code converts a {+language+} regular expression to a
``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` instance:

.. code-block:: ruby

   regexp = /^Hello.world/
   bson_regexp = BSON::Regexp::Raw.new(regexp.source, regexp.options)
   # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055df62e42d60 @pattern="^Hello.world", @options=0>

The ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` constructor accepts both the {+language+} numeric
options and the PCRE modifier strings.

To convert a BSON regular expression to a {+language+} regular expression, call the
``compile`` method on the BSON regular expression:

.. code-block:: ruby

   bson_regexp = BSON::Regexp::Raw.new("^hello.world", "s")
   bson_regexp.compile
   # => /^hello.world/m
 
   bson_regexp = BSON::Regexp::Raw.new("^hello.world", "")
   bson_regexp.compile
   # => /^hello.world/
 
   bson_regexp = BSON::Regexp::Raw.new("^hello.world", "m")
   bson_regexp.compile
   # => /^hello.world/

The ``s`` PCRE modifier was converted to the ``m`` Ruby modifier
in the first example in the preceding code, and the last two examples
were converted to the same regular expression even though the original
BSON regular expressions had different meanings.

When a BSON regular expression uses the non-portable ``^`` and ``$``
anchors, its conversion to a {+language+} regular expression can change
its meaning:

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::Regexp::Raw.new("^hello.world", "").compile =~ "42\nhello world"
   # => 3

When a {+language+} regular expression is converted to a BSON regular
expression, for example as part of a query, the BSON regular
expression always has the ``m`` modifier set, reflecting the behavior of
``^`` and ``$`` anchors in {+language+} regular expressions.

Read and Write Regex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both {+language+} and BSON regular expressions implement the ``to_bson``
method for serializing to BSON:

.. code-block:: ruby

   regexp_ruby = /^b403158/
   # => /^b403158/
   regexp_ruby.to_bson
   # => #<BSON::ByteBuffer:0x007fcf20ab8028>
   _.to_s
   # => "^b403158\x00m\x00"

   regexp_raw = Regexp::Raw.new("^b403158")
   # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x007fcf21808f98 @pattern="^b403158", @options="">
   regexp_raw.to_bson
   # => #<BSON::ByteBuffer:0x007fcf213622f0>
   _.to_s
   # => "^b403158\x00\x00"

Both ``Regexp`` and ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` classes implement the ``from_bson``
class method that deserializes a regular expression from a BSON byte buffer.
Methods of both classes return a ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` instance that
must be converted to a {+language+} regular expression by using the
``compile`` method as described in the preceding code.

The following code demonstrates how to use the ``from_bson`` method to
deserialize a regular expression:

.. code-block:: ruby

   byte_buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new("^b403158\x00\x00")
   regex = Regexp.from_bson(byte_buffer)
   # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055df63100d40 @pattern="^b403158", @options="">
   regex.pattern
   # => "^b403158"
   regex.options
   # => ""
   regex.compile
   # => /^b403158/

Key Order
---------

BSON documents preserve the order of keys, because documents are stored
as lists of key-value pairs. Hashes in {+language+} also preserve key order,
so the order of keys specified in your application are preserved when
you serialize a hash to a BSON document, and when you deserialize a BSON
document into a hash.

Duplicate Keys
--------------

The BSON specification allows BSON documents to have duplicate keys, because
documents are stored as lists of key-value pairs. Avoid creating
documents that contain duplicate keys, because {+mdb-server+} behavior
is undefined when a BSON document contains duplicate keys.

In {+language+}, hashes cannot have duplicate keys. When you serialize
{+language+} hashes to BSON documents, no duplicate keys are generated.

Because keys in BSON documents are always stored as strings,
specifying the same key as as string and a symbol in Ruby retains only the
most recent specification:

.. code-block:: ruby

   BSON::Document.new(test: 1, 'test' => 2)
   # => {"test"=>2}

When loading a BSON document with duplicate keys, the last value for a
duplicated key overwrites previous values for the same key.
