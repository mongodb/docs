Exit Codes and Statuses
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB will return one of the following codes and statuses when
exiting. Use this guide to interpret logs and when troubleshooting
issues with :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances.

.. error:: 0

   Returned by MongoDB applications upon successful exit.

   .. symbol: EXIT_CLEAN

.. error:: 2

   The specified options are in error or are incompatible
   with other options.

   .. symbol: EXIT_BADOPTIONS 2

.. error:: 3

   Returned by :program:`mongod` if there is a mismatch between hostnames
   specified on the command line and in the :data:`local.sources`
   collection. :program:`mongod` may also return this status if
   :term:`oplog` collection in the ``local`` database is not readable.

   .. symbol: EXIT_REPLICATION_ERROR = 3

.. error:: 4

   The version of the database is different from the version supported
   by the :program:`mongod` (or :program:`mongod.exe`) instance.  The
   instance exits cleanly.  Restart :program:`mongod` with the
   :option:`--upgrade <mongod --upgrade>` option to upgrade the
   database to the version supported by this :program:`mongod`
   instance.

   .. symbol: EXIT_NEED_UPGRADE = 4

.. error:: 5

   Returned by :program:`mongod` if a :dbcommand:`moveChunk` operation
   fails to confirm a commit.

   .. symbol: EXIT_SHARDING_ERROR = 5

.. error:: 12

   Returned by the :program:`mongod.exe` process on Windows when it
   receives a Control-C, Close, Break or Shutdown event.

   .. symbol: EXIT_KILL = 12

.. error:: 14

   Returned by MongoDB applications which encounter an unrecoverable
   error, an uncaught exception or uncaught signal.  The system exits
   without performing a clean shut down.

   .. symbol: EXIT_ABRUPT = 14

.. error:: 20

   *Message:* ``ERROR: wsastartup failed <reason>``

   Returned by MongoDB applications on Windows following an error in the
   WSAStartup function.

   *Message:* ``NT Service Error``

   Returned by MongoDB applications for Windows due to failures installing,
   starting or removing the NT Service for the application.

   .. symbol: EXIT_NTSERVICE_ERROR = 20

.. error:: 45

   Returned when a MongoDB application cannot open a file or cannot
   obtain a lock on a file.

   .. Symbol: EXIT_FS

.. error:: 47

   MongoDB applications exit cleanly following a large clock skew (32768
   milliseconds) event.

   .. symbol: EXIT_CLOCK_SKEW

.. error:: 48

   :program:`mongod` exits cleanly if the server socket closes. The
   server socket is on port ``27017`` by default, or as specified to
   the :option:`--port <mongod --port>` run-time option.

   .. symbol: EXIT_NET_ERROR = 48

.. error:: 49

   Returned by :program:`mongod.exe` or :program:`mongos.exe` on Windows
   when either receives a shutdown message from the
   :guilabel:`Windows Service Control Manager`.

   .. symbol: EXIT_WINDOWS_SERVICE_STOP 49

.. error:: 100

   Returned by :program:`mongod` when the process throws an uncaught exception.

   .. symbol: EXIT_UNCAUGHT = 100
