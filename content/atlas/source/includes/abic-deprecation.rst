   The MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence for |service| and on-premises reaches end-of-life (EOL) and will no longer be supported after September 2026.
   For all new projects, we recommend using the new MongoDB {+sql-interface+} to 
   connect to |service| or Enterprise Advanced deployments.
   The {+sql-interface+} offers improved performance, a simplified setup, and enhanced
   features. To learn more, see :ref:`connect-with-sql-overview`.
