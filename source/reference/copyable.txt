=============
Copyable Code
=============

Some code blocks are intended for users to copy. The MongoDB theme
will add a "copy" button to any code block not annotated with the
`:copyable: false` option.

Plain rST
---------

With Copy Button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For example, the following:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. code-block:: sh

      echo "This block has a 'copy' button"

Appears as:

.. code-block:: sh

   echo "This block has a 'copy' button"

Without Copy Button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conversely, the following:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. code-block:: sh
      :copyable: false

      echo "This block has a 'copy' button"

Appears as:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   echo "This block has a 'copy' button"

Steps YAML
----------

For steps, Giza transforms a YAML file into rST, creating the
code block itself. In each "action" definition, you may add a
``copyable: false`` field.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   title: Configure the package management system (``zypper``).
   ref: config-zypper
   action:
    copyable: false
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo zypper addrepo --no-gpgcheck https://repo.mongodb.com/zypper/suse/11/mongodb-enterprise/2.6/x86_64/ mongodb

.. note::

   This requires Giza 0.5.18, which as of 2018-03-06 is unreleased.
