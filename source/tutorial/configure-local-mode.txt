Overview
--------

The Automation Agents require archived MongoDB binaries to install MongoDB on
new deployments and to upgrade versions on existing MongoDB deployments. The
Backup Daemons require the extracted MongoDB binaries.

In a default configuration, the agents and daemons access the binaries over
the internet from |company| The :setting:`Version Manifest Source` setting
determines whether |onprem| runs in :guilabel:`Internet Mode` or
:guilabel:`Local Mode`.

If the servers running Automation Agents or Backup Daemons do not have
internet access, you must:

* Configure |onprem| to run in :guilabel:`Local Mode`,

* Download the MongoDB binaries for each version and platform you need
  to support, and

* Update the :term:`version manifest`. 

As |company| releases new versions, you must update both the binaries and
the version manifest.

.. _versions-directory:

Versions Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The versions directory stores all of the archived and extracted MongoDB
binaries Automation and Backup need to install and upgrade MongoDB
deployments.

If you run in :guilabel:`Local Mode`, you must:

* Download the necessary MongoDB archived binaries manually from |company|

* Store the archives in this directory on each of your |onprem| servers

* Extract the MongoDB binaries from these archives for the Backup Daemons 

* Grant the ``mongodb-mms`` user permission to read the contents of this directory

* Specify this path for this directory in the :setting:`Versions Directory`
  setting on your |onprem| application

.. _version-manifest:

Version Manifest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The version manifest provides |onprem| with a list of all released MongoDB
versions available to your |onprem| servers.

In Local Mode:
  In the :ref:`versions directory <versions-directory>`, you must have:

  * Archived MongoDB binaries for each version, edition *and* platform
    you need to support for Automation, and

  * Extracted MongoDB binaries for each version, edition *and* paltform you
    need to support for Backup.

  For a given |onprem| :term:`group`, the MongoDB binary for the needed
  version must also be selected in the group's
  :ref:`Version Manager <version-manager>`. 

  You must update the version manifest as |company| releases new versions.

In Internet Mode:
  |onprem| automatically updates the version manifest from |company| 

Prerequisites
-------------

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure :guilabel:`Local Mode`, you must have 
:ref:`Global Owner <global-owner-role>` access to |onprem|.

The ``mongodb-mms`` user needs permission to read the contents of the versions
directory

Before configuring |onprem| to run in :guilabel:`Local Mode`, you must meet the
prerequisites described here.

.. _local-mode-determine-versions:

Determine which Binaries to Store Locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For every edition and version of MongoDB you want to install or upgrade,
Automation needs an archived MongoDB binary (``.tgz`` or ``.zip`` for Windows)
for each operating system. Backup requires an extracted MongoDB binary for
each platform.

These binaries and archives must be stored in the :setting:`Versions Directory`.

You need binaries for each MongoDB version that you: 

- Have in each existing deployment to be imported into |onprem|.

- May use to create new deployments through |onprem| Automation.

- May use during an intermediary step in an upgrade. 

  .. example::
     If you import an existing deployment of MongoDB 2.6 Community and want to
     upgrade it to MongoDB 3.0 Enterprise, you must download and store all
     archived binaries for:

     * MongoDB 2.6 Community Edition
     * MongoDB 3.0 Community Edition
     * MongoDB 3.0 Enterprise Edition

..important::

  You do not need to download the archived MongoDB binary for every platform,
  only the one(s) in your current and planned MongoDB deployments.

To locate the required archived binaries for specific versions, editions and platforms:

#. Navigate to the `Download Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community>`_. 

#. Click the appropriate MongoDB edition, platform and MongoDB version: 
   
   - `Community <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community>`_

     - Click the tab for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X or Solaris.

     - Select the appropriate platform distribution and version 
       from the :guilabel:`Version` dropdown menu.

     - For the current released version, highlight the link to the current version.

     - For older versions:
  
       - Click :guilabel:`All Version Binaries`.
  
       - Locate the version you wish to download, click the link to the appropriate archived binary.

   - `Enterprise <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#enterprise>`_

     - Select the platform from the :guilabel:`Platforms` dropdown menu.

     - For the current release version, click :guilabel:`Download`.
  
       - After the :guilabel:`Install MongoDB Enterprise` modal displays,
         click the :guilabel:`archive` link.

     - For older versions, click the :guilabel:`Archived Releases` link.
  
       - After the :guilabel:`Archived Downloads` page displays, navigate to
         the appropriate platform and version and then click the link to the
         right of the :guilabel:`Archive`.

.. warning:: **Remove Unnecessary Versions**

   #. Click :guilabel:`Deployment`, then :guilabel:`Version Manager`.

   #. Clear the checkbox for every version you do not plan to deploy before
      enabling :guilabel:`Local Mode`.

      If you leave unused versions selected and do not download their
      associated binaries, |onprem| fails a pre-flight check when it starts.

   If you did not clear unused versions or download the associated
   binaries, you can take |onprem| out of :guilabel:`Local Mode` temporarily to
   pass the |onprem| pre-flight check. See :ref:`Start Ops Manager When
   All Versions Are Not Downloaded <fix-local-mode-start-failure>` for
   the procedure.

Install Enterprise Dependencies (MongoDB Enterprise Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you will run :term:`MongoDB Enterprise` and use Linux servers, then you must
manually install a set of dependencies to each server **before installing MongoDB**.
The MongoDB manual provides the appropriate command to install the dependencies.
See the link for the server's platform:

Configure Local Mode
--------------------

.. important::

   If you have not yet read the :ref:`local-mode-determine-versions` topic
   on this page, please do so before continuing with this procedure.

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-local-mode.rst

.. _fix-local-mode-start-failure:

Start |onprem| When All Versions Are Not Downloaded
---------------------------------------------------

|onprem| sets the default source of MongoDB binaries to be over the
Internet from MongoDB. This enables you to install all versions of
MongoDB. This allows |onprem| to deploy any supported version of
MongoDB.

When you set |onprem| to *Local Mode*, |onprem| checks to see if the
binaries for all of the versions you set in the :guilabel:`Version
Manager` can be found in the :setting:`Versions Directory` on the
|onprem| server. If these binaries are not found, |onprem| fails this
"pre-flight" check and stops.

To allow you to start |onprem|, you can either install all of the
binaries for every version of MongoDB or change the configuration of
|onprem| temporarily to allow it to start and let you change the
versions of MongoDB your |onprem| server supports.


Change Configuration File to Allow |onprem| to Start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change the |onprem| configuration temporarily:

.. include:: /includes/steps/fix-preflight-error.rst

Revert the Configuration File to Return to Local Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If these steps are not completed, |onprem| remains in Internet mode and
displays a notice in the configuration page notifying you that the
:guilabel:`Local Mode` setting in your ``conf-mms.properties``
overrides this setting.

To revert the |onprem| configuration change:

.. include:: /includes/steps/revert-preflight-error.rst
