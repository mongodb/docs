pre: |

   Using an archive manager program or the ``tar`` command, extract the
   files. For example, to extract from the terminal shell, you can use the
   following ``tar`` command:
      
   .. tip::

      If you downloaded a different MongoDB {+version+} point release,
      be sure to modify the command to reflect the correct ``.tgz``
      file name.

   .. code-block:: bash

      tar -zxvf mongodb-linux-x86_64-*-{+release+}.tgz

title: Optional. Ensure the binaries are in a directory listed in your ``PATH`` environment variable.

   The MongoDB binaries are in the ``<mongodb-install-directory>/bin``
   directory. To avoid having to specify the path to the MongoDB
   binaries, add the contents of the
   ``<mongodb-install-directory>/bin/`` directory to a directory in the
   ``$PATH`` such as ``/usr/bin/``. For example, you can either:

   - Copy the binaries into ``/usr/bin/``.

     .. code-block:: bash

        sudo cp <mongodb-install-directory>/bin/* /usr/bin/

     **-OR-**

   - Create symbolic links to each of these binaries to ``/usr/bin/``:

     .. code-block:: bash

        sudo ln -s /full/path/to/<mongodb-install-directory>/bin/* /usr/bin/

     Replace ``/full/path/to`` with the full path to the extracted 
     directory contents.
