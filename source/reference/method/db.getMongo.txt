.. method:: db.getMongo()

   :returns: The current database connection.

   :method:`db.getMongo()` runs when the shell initiates. Use this
   command to test that :binary:`~bin.mongosh` has a connection to
   the proper database instance.

.. note::

   The legacy :binary:`mongo` shell has a sub-command,
   ``db.getMongo().setSecondaryOk()``, which is not available in
   :binary:`mongosh`. In :binary:`mongosh`, use
   :method:`Mongo.setReadPref()` instead.
