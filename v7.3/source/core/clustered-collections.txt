Clustered Collections

   You must drop clustered collections before you can downgrade to
   a version of MongoDB earlier than 5.3.

Benefits
--------

Clustered collections have the following benefits compared to
non-clustered collections:

- Faster queries on clustered collections without needing a secondary
  index, such as queries with range scans and equality comparisons on
  the clustered index key.

- Clustered collections have a lower storage size, which improves
  performance for queries and bulk inserts.

- Clustered collections can eliminate the need for a secondary :ref:`TTL
  (Time To Live) index <ttl-index>`.

  - A clustered index is also a TTL index if you specify the
    :ref:`expireAfterSeconds <db.createCollection.expireAfterSeconds>`
    field.

  - To be used as a TTL index, the ``_id`` field must be a supported
    date type. See :ref:`index-feature-ttl`.

  - If you use a clustered index as a TTL index, it improves document
    delete performance and reduces the clustered collection storage
    size.

- Clustered collections have additional performance improvements for
  inserts, updates, deletes, and queries.

  - All collections have an :ref:`_id index <index-type-id>`.

  - A non-clustered collection stores the ``_id`` index separately from
    the documents. This requires two writes for inserts, updates, and
    deletes, and two reads for queries.
    
  - A clustered collection stores the index and the documents together
    in ``_id`` value order. This requires one write for inserts,
    updates, and deletes, and one read for queries.

Behavior
--------

Clustered collections store documents ordered by the :ref:`clustered
index <db.createCollection.clusteredIndex>` key value. The clustered 
index key must be ``{ _id: 1 }``. 

You can only have one clustered index in a collection because the
documents can be stored in only one order. Only collections with a
clustered index store the data in sorted order.

You can have a clustered index and add :term:`secondary indexes
<secondary index>` to a clustered collection. Clustered indexes differ
from secondary indexes:

- A clustered index can only be created when you create the collection.

- The clustered index keys are stored with the collection. The
  collection size returned by the :dbcommand:`collStats` command
  includes the clustered index size.

Starting in MongoDB 6.0.7, if a usable clustered index exists, the MongoDB
query planner evaluates the clustered index against secondary indexes in
the query planning process. When a query uses a clustered index, MongoDB
performs a :term:`bounded collection scan`.

Prior to MongoDB 6.0.7, if a :term:`secondary index <secondary index>`
existed on a clustered collection and the secondary index was usable by
your query, the query planner selected the secondary index instead of the
clustered index by default. In MongoDB 6.1 and prior, to use the
clustered index, you must provide a hint because the :doc:`query
optimizer </core/query-plans>` does not automatically select the
clustered index. 

Limitations
-----------

Clustered collection limitations:

- The clustered index key must be ``{ _id: 1 }``.

- You cannot transform a non-clustered collection to a clustered
  collection, or the reverse. Instead, you can:

  - Read documents from one collection and write them to another
    collection using an :ref:`aggregation pipeline
    <aggregation-pipeline-intro>` with an :pipeline:`$out` stage or
    a :pipeline:`$merge` stage.

  - Export collection data with :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and import the
    data into another collection with :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`.

- You cannot hide a clustered index. See :doc:`Hidden indexes
  </core/index-hidden>`.

- If there are secondary indexes for the clustered collection, the
  collection has a larger storage size. This is because secondary
  indexes on a clustered collection with large clustered index keys may
  have a larger storage size than secondary indexes on a non-clustered
  collection.

- Clustered collections may not be :ref:`capped collections
  <manual-capped-collection>`.

.. _clustered-collections-clustered-index-key-values:

Set Your Own Clustered Index Key Values
---------------------------------------

By default, the :ref:`clustered index
<db.createCollection.clusteredIndex>` key values are the unique document
:ref:`object identifiers <objectid>`.

You can set your own clustered index key values. Your key:

- Must contain unique values.

- Must be immutable.

- Should contain sequentially increasing values. This is not a
  requirement but improves insert performance.

- Should be as small in size as possible.

  - A clustered index supports keys up to 8 MB in size, but a much
    smaller clustered index key is best.

  - A large clustered index key causes the clustered collection to
    increase in size and secondary indexes are also larger. This reduces
    the performance and storage benefits of the clustered collection.

  - Secondary indexes on clustered collections with large clustered
    index keys may use more space compared to secondary indexes on
    non-clustered collections.

.. warning::

   Randomly generated key values may decrease a clustered collection's
   performance.

Examples
--------

This section shows clustered collection examples.

``Create`` Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/create-clustered-collection-example.rst

``db.createCollection`` Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/db-create-clustered-collection-example.rst

Date Clustered Index Key Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following :dbcommand:`create` example adds a clustered collection
named ``orders``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection(
      "orders",
      { clusteredIndex: { "key": { _id: 1 }, "unique": true, "name": "orders clustered key" } }
   )

In the example, :ref:`clusteredIndex
<db.createCollection.clusteredIndex>` specifies:

.. |clustered-index-name| replace:: ``"name": "orders clustered key"``

.. include:: /includes/clustered-index-example-fields.rst

The following example adds documents to the ``orders`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.insertMany( [
      { _id: ISODate( "2022-03-18T12:45:20Z" ), "quantity": 50, "totalOrderPrice": 500 },
      { _id: ISODate( "2022-03-18T12:47:00Z" ), "quantity": 5, "totalOrderPrice": 50 },
      { _id: ISODate( "2022-03-18T12:50:00Z" ), "quantity": 1, "totalOrderPrice": 10 }
   ] )

The ``_id`` :ref:`clusteredIndex <create.clusteredIndex>` key stores the
order date.

If you use the ``_id`` field in a range query, performance is improved.
For example, the following query uses ``_id`` and :expression:`$gt` to
return the orders where the order date is greater than the supplied
date:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.find( { _id: { $gt: ISODate( "2022-03-18T12:47:00.000Z" ) } } )

Example output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
      {
         _id: ISODate( "2022-03-18T12:50:00.000Z" ),
         quantity: 1,
         totalOrderPrice: 10
      }
   ]

Determine if a Collection is Clustered
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To determine if a collection is clustered, use the
:dbcommand:`listCollections` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { listCollections: 1 } )

For clustered collections, you will see the :ref:`clusteredIndex
<create.clusteredIndex>` details in the output. For example, the
following output shows the details for the ``orders`` clustered
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   ...
   name: 'orders',
   type: 'collection',
   options: {
      clusteredIndex: {
         v: 2,
         key: { _id: 1 },
         name: 'orders clustered key',
         unique: true
      }
   },
   ...

``v`` is the index version.
