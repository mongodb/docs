      **SRV Record for DNS Seedlist Private Endpoint-Aware Connection 
      Strings**

      The following example shows the SRV record for an {+aws-pl+}
      -enabled single-region {+cluster+}, showing three unique ports 
      defined for ``pl-0-us-east-1-k45tj.mongodb.net``:

         $ nslookup -type=SRV _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0-k45tj.mongodb.net

         In the preceding example:

         - ``_mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0-k45tj.mongodb.net`` is the SRV
           record that the
           ``mongodb+srv://cluster0-pl-0-k45tj.mongodb.net``
           connection string references.
         - ``pl-0-us-east-1-k45tj.mongodb.net`` is the hostname for each
           node in one |service| {+cluster+} in one region for which 
           you have configured {+aws-pl+}.
         - ``1024``, ``1025``, and ``1026`` are unique ports that 
           |service| assigns on the load balancer for each |service| 
           replica set node in the region for which you enabled 
           {+aws-pl+}. All nodes in an |service| replica set are 
           accessible via the same hostname, with the load balancer 
           resolving individual nodes by their unique port.

      **Hostname DNS Resolution in Private Endpoint-Aware Connection 
      Strings and SRV Records**

      The hostname in the SRV record and the standard connection string 
      is a |dns| Canonical Name (``CNAME``) record that resolves to the
      endpoint-specific regional |dns| name that |aws| generates for the
      interface endpoint. A |dns| ``ALIAS`` record exists for each 
      subnet in your |vpc| that you deployed the interface endpoint to. 
      Each ``ALIAS`` record contains the private IP address of the 
      :term:`interface endpoint` for that subnet.

      The following example shows the |dns| lookup for the hostname in 
      the SRV record and in the standard connection string, including 
      the endpoint-specific regional |dns| name for the interface 
      endpoint and its |dns| ``ALIAS`` records:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         $ nslookup pl-0-us-east-1-k45tj.mongodb.net
