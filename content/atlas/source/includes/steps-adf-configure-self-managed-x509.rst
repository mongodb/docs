   .. step:: Turn on Self-Managed X.509 Authentication.
      
      Toggle :guilabel:`Self-Managed X.509 Authentication` to
      :guilabel:`ON`.
      
   .. step:: Provide a PEM-encoded Certificate Authority.
      
      You can provide a Certificate Authority (CA) by:
       
      - Clicking :guilabel:`Upload` and selecting a ``.pem`` file from
        your filesystem.
      
      - Copying the contents of a ``.pem`` file into the provided text
        area.
      
      You can concatenate multiple CAs in the same ``.pem`` file or in the
      text area. Users can authenticate with certificates generated by any
      of the provided CAs.
      
      When you upload a CA, a project-level alert is
      automatically created to send a notification 30 days before
      the CA expires, repeating every 24 hours. You can view and
      edit this alert from |service|'s :guilabel:`Alert Settings` page. For
      more information on configuring alerts, see 
      :ref:`<configure-alerts>`.
      
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Save`.
