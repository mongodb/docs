Set Max Time MS for Aggregation Queries

   :description: Set an upper time limit for aggregation pipelines in MongoDB Compass using the Max Time MS option to manage query execution time.

Use the :guilabel:`Max Time MS` option on the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab to 
specify an upper time limit in milliseconds for aggregation pipelines
that run in |compass|. 

About this Task 
---------------

By default, :guilabel:`Max Time MS` is set to 60000 milliseconds, or 60 seconds. 
Consider raising this value if you have a large collection or your operations 
frequently time out. Alternatively, consider lowering the 
:guilabel:`Max Time MS` value to quickly identify inefficient or 
resource-intensive pipeline operations.

.. BEGIN-COMPASS-ONLY

If you already specified a ``maxTimeMS`` value in the :ref:`Compass Settings 
panel <compass-interface-settings>`, the :ref:`command line <cli-options>`, or 
a :ref:`configuration file <config-file-options>`, the :guilabel:`Max Time MS` 
that you specify for your pipeline must be lower than the limit you previously 
specified.

.. END-COMPASS-ONLY

If your aggregation operation goes over the time limit, |compass-short| raises 
a timeout error.

Steps 
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Options`
      
      On the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab, click :guilabel:`Options`

      .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-click-more-options.png
         :alt: More Options dropdown.

   .. step:: Specify a :guilabel:`Max Time MS` value

      Next to the :guilabel:`Max Time MS` field, enter a numeric value to set as 
      the maximum amount of time in milliseconds that an aggregation 
      pipeline can run.  
      
      For example, to set a ``5`` second limit, enter ``5000``.
