  documents that match the :term:`JSON document` specified as
  ``'<JSON>'``. Be sure to include the document in single quotes to avoid
  interaction with your system's shell environment.

directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Validates each :term:`BSON` object before outputting it in :term:`JSON`
  format. By default, :program:`bsondump` enables :option:`--objcheck`.
  For objects with a high degree of sub-document nesting,
  :option:`--objcheck` can have a small impact on performance. You can set
  :option:`--noobjcheck` to disable object checking.

  .. versionchanged:: 2.4
     MongoDB enables :option:`--objcheck` by default, to prevent any
     client from inserting malformed or invalid BSON into a MongoDB
     database.
