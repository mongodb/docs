Configure Additional Settings
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 2
   :class: singlecol

You can configure the following additional settings for your
|service| {+cluster+}.

.. _create-cluster-version:

Select the MongoDB Version of the {+Cluster+}
---------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-mongodb-version.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-best-practices.rst

To select the MongoDB version for your cluster, use the
dropdown in the :guilabel:`Additional Settings` section
of the {+cluster+} form.

You can upgrade an existing |service| {+cluster+} to a newer major
MongoDB version, if available, when you 
:ref:`scale a cluster <scale-cluster-version>`. However, you 
can't downgrade a {+cluster+} from one major version to a previous
major version.

.. important::

   If your project contains a :ref:`custom role <mongodb-roles>`
   that uses actions introduced in a specific MongoDB version, you
   can't create a {+cluster+} with a MongoDB version less than that
   version unless you delete the custom role.

Choosing a Release Cadence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set your |service| {+cluster+}s to follow either a 
:ref:`major release <major-releases>` cadence or a
rapid release cadence.

Free-tier and shared-tier {+cluster+}s must follow a major release 
cadence. You can configure a dedicated-tier {+cluster+} to follow a 
major release cadence by selecting a specific MongoDB version from the
dropdown in the :guilabel:`Additional Settings` section
of the {+cluster+} form.

|service| does not automatically upgrade {+cluster+}s on the major 
release cadence. You must schedule a manual upgrade to each new 
major release as it enters general availability.

You can configure a dedicated-tier {+cluster+} to follow a rapid 
release cadence by selecting :guilabel:`Latest Release` from the
dropdown in the :guilabel:`Additional Settings` section
of the {+cluster+} form.

You can configure a {+cluster+} for rapid releases only if it 
is running the most recent major release of MongoDB. If your
{+cluster+} is running a prior major release, manually upgrade
to the most recent major release to enable the transition to rapid 
release.

|service| uses the most recent MongoDB release for {+cluster+}s 
that follow the rapid release cadence. |service| automatically upgrades
these {+cluster+}s to the new major *and* rapid release versions
via a rolling process to maintain {+cluster+} availability
as each release becomes available. During the upgrade to the next rapid 
release version, the {+cluster+} in the |service| UI 
:guilabel:`Database Deployments` page might show the |fcv-link| 
of your {+cluster+} instead of the MongoDB version to reflect the 
features that are currently available on your cluster.

.. note::

   If you switch a {+cluster+} from the major release to the rapid
   release cadence, it will upgrade directly to the currently available
   rapid release. For example, if MongoDB 6.2 is the latest rapid 
   release and you configure a {+cluster+} running 6.0 for rapid 
   release, it will upgrade directly to MongoDB 6.2

You can revert a {+cluster+} that follows the rapid release cadence to
the major release cadence by selecting the most recent major release
from the :guilabel:`Select a Version` dropdown menu. However, you can
only do this before the first rapid release of the year is available. 
After a {+cluster+} updates from a major release version to a rapid 
release version, you can't revert the {+cluster+} until the next major 
release.

To learn more about MongoDB versions, see :manual:`MongoDB Versioning
</reference/versioning>` in the MongoDB Manual. For additional details
about the rapid release cadence, see 
`Understanding the MongoDB Stable API and Rapid Release Cadence <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/understanding-mongodb-stable-api-rapid-release-cadence>`__.

.. _create-cluster-backups:

Configure Backup Options for the {+Cluster+}
--------------------------------------------

This section describes the backup configuration options for your
|service| {+cluster+}.

M2/M5 Tier Backup Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| automatically enables backups for ``M2`` and ``M5``
{+shared-clusters+} and you can't disable them. To learn more, see
:ref:`m2-m5-snapshots`.

M10+ Tier Backup Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable backups for an ``M10+`` |service| {+cluster+}, toggle
:guilabel:`Turn on Backup (M10 and up)` to ``Yes``.
If enabled, |service| takes snapshots of your databases at
regular intervals and retains them according to your project's
:ref:`retention policy <retention-policy>`.

|service| provides the following backup options for ``M10+``
clusters:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Backup Option
     - Description

   * - :doc:`/backup/legacy-backup/overview`

     - .. include:: /includes/admonitions/deprecated-continuous-backup.rst

       |service| takes incremental snapshots of the data in your 
       {+cluster+} and lets you :doc:`restore 
       </backup/legacy-backup/restore>` the data from stored
       snapshots or from a selected point in time within the last 24
       hours. You can also :doc:`query a {+old-backup+} snapshot
       </backup/legacy-backup/backup-query>`.

       Each project has *one* backup data center location dictated by
       the *first* backup-enabled {+cluster+} created in that project. 
       To learn more, see :ref:`continuous-snapshot-storage-location`.

   * - :doc:`/backup/cloud-backup/overview`

     - |service| takes incremental snapshots of the data in your 
       {+cluster+} and lets you restore the data from those snapshots. 
       |service| stores snapshots in the same cloud provider region as 
       the replica set member targeted for snapshots.

.. _create-cluster-sharding:
.. _cluster-option-sharding:

Deploy a Sharded {+Cluster+}
----------------------------

.. tip:: 

   .. include:: /includes/fact-online-archive-recommendation.rst

To deploy your cluster as a :term:`sharded cluster <sharded cluster>`,
toggle :guilabel:`Shard your cluster (M30 and up)` to ``Yes``.

:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` support horizontal scaling 
and consist of :manual:`shards </core/sharded-cluster-shards>`,
:ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>` and
:term:`mongos <mongos>` routers:

.. include:: /includes/list-sharded-cluster-components.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-conversion-sharded-clusters.rst

To learn more about how the number of server instances affect cost, see
:ref:`server-number-costs`.

To learn more about sharded clusters, see
:manual:`Sharding </sharding>` in the MongoDB manual.

.. _create-cluster-shardNum:

Configure the Number of Shards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/cluster-option-clusterShardingNum.rst

Consideration for Upgrading a Replica Set to a Sharded {+Cluster+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your {+cluster+} tier is ``M30`` or higher, you can upgrade 
your replica set deployment to a sharded {+cluster+} deployment.

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-to-sharded-cluster-warning.rst

.. _create-cluster-enable-bi:

Enable |bic|
------------

To enable `BI Connector for Atlas
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/bi-connector/master/>`__ for this 
{+cluster+}, toggle :guilabel:`Enable Business Intelligence Connector 
(M10 and up)` to :guilabel:`Yes`.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/cluster-option-bi-cluster-requirements.rst

If enabled, select the node type from which |bic|
should read.

.. _bic-read-preferences:

Read Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes the available read preferences for
|bic-short| and their corresponding
:manual:`readPreference </reference/read-preference>` and
:manual:`readPreferenceTag </core/read-preference-tags>`
connection string options.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 30 20 30

   * - |bic-short-no-link| Read Preference
     - Description
     - readPreference
     - readPreferenceTags

   * - Primary
     - Read from the :term:`primary` node.
     - ``primary``
     - None

   * - Secondary
     - Read from :term:`secondary` nodes.
     - ``secondary``
     - ``{ nodeType : ELECTABLE }`` or ``{ nodeType : READ_ONLY }``

   * - Analytics
     - Read from :term:`analytics nodes <analytics node>`.
     - ``secondary``
     - ``{ nodeType : ANALYTICS }``

Node Types
``````````

The ``nodeType`` read preference tag dictates the type of node |bic|
connects to. You can specify the following values for this option:

- ``ELECTABLE`` restricts |bic-short| to the :term:`primary` and
  electable :term:`secondary` nodes.

- ``READ_ONLY`` restricts |bic-short| to connecting to
  non-electable :term:`secondary` nodes.

- ``ANALYTICS`` restricts |bic-short| to connecting to
  :ref:`analytics nodes <analytics-nodes-overview>`.

  .. tip::

     When you use the :guilabel:`Analytics` read preference, |service|
     places |bic| on the same hardware as the analytics nodes that
     |bic| reads from.

     By isolating electable data-bearing nodes from the |bic|, electable
     nodes don't compete for resources with |bic|, thus improving
     {+cluster+} reliability and performance.

For high traffic production environments, connecting to the
:guilabel:`Secondary Node(s)` or :guilabel:`Analytics Node(s)` may
be preferable to connecting to the :guilabel:`Primary Node`.

For {+clusters+} with one or more
:ref:`analytics nodes <analytics-nodes-overview>`, select
:guilabel:`Analytics Node` to isolate |bic| queries from
your operational workload and read from dedicated, read-only
analytics nodes. With this option, electable nodes don't compete
for resources with |bic|, thus improving cluster reliability and
performance.

Sampling Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |bic-short-no-link| generates a relational schema by
:bic:`sampling data </schema/cached-sampling/>` from MongoDB. You can 
configure the following sampling settings:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 10 65
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - |bic-short-no-link| Option
     - Type
     - Description

   * - Schema Sample Size
     - integer
     - *Optional.* The number of documents that the BI Connector
       samples for each database when it gathers schema information.
       To learn more, see the
       :bic:`BI Connector documentation
       </reference/mongosqld/#cmdoption-mongosqld-samplesize>`.

   * - Sample Refresh Interval
     - integer
     - *Optional.* The frequency, in seconds, at which the BI
       Connector re-samples data to recreate the schema.To learn more, 
       see the :bic:`BI Connector documentation </reference/mongosqld/#cmdoption-mongosqld-samplerefreshintervalsecs>`.

.. _create-cluster-enable-encryption:

Manage Your Own Encryption Keys
-------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-atlas-free-tier-limits.rst

|service| encrypts all {+cluster+} storage and snapshot volumes,
ensuring the security of all {+cluster+} data at rest
(Encryption at Rest). |service|
:authrole:`Project Owners <Project Owner>` can configure
an added layer of encryption on their data at rest using the
MongoDB :manual:`Encrypted Storage Engine 
</core/security-encryption-at-rest>`
and their |service|-compatible Encryption at Rest provider.

|service| supports the following Encryption at Rest providers:

- :ref:`AWS Key Management Services <security-aws-kms>`
- :ref:`Azure Key Vault <security-azure-kms>`
- :ref:`Google Cloud KMS <security-gcp-kms>`

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You must configure the |service| project for Encryption at Rest
  using your Key Management before you enable the feature for your
  |service| {+clusters+}. To learn more,
  see :ref:`security-kms-encryption`.

- To switch from one Encryption at Rest provider on your
  {+cluster+} to another, you must first disable Encryption at Rest for
  your {+cluster+}, then re-enable it with your desired Encryption at
  Rest provider. To learn more, see :doc:`/security-kms-encryption`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To start managing your own encryption keys for this {+cluster+},
toggle :guilabel:`Encryption using your Key Management (M10 and up)`
to :guilabel:`Yes`.

|service| Encryption at Rest using your Key Management is available for
``M10+`` replica set {+clusters+}. |service| Encryption
at Rest supports encrypting :ref:`backup-cloud-provider` **only**.
You can't enable Encryption at Rest on a {+cluster+} using
:ref:`legacy-backup`.

Managing your own encryption keys incurs an increase to the hourly run
costs of your {+clusters+}. To learn more about |service| billing for
advanced security features, see :ref:`advanced-security`.

.. important::

   If |service| can't access the |service| project key management
   provider or the encryption key used to encrypt a {+cluster+},
   that {+cluster+} becomes inaccessible and unrecoverable. Exercise
   extreme caution before you modify, delete, or disable an
   encryption key or the key management provider credentials that
   |service| uses.

.. _create-cluster-more-configuration-options:

Configure Additional Options
----------------------------


You can configure the following |mongod| runtime options on ``M10+``
paid tier {+clusters+}.

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| dynamically modifies the :guilabel:`Oplog Size` for replica
sets and sharded clusters. However, for the :guilabel:`Minimum TLS
Protocol Version` and :guilabel:`Allow Server-Side JavaScript`
settings, it performs a rolling restart of the shard members
and the config server replica set. To learn more about how |service|
supports high availability during maintenance operations, see
:ref:`high-availability`.

Locate Additional Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view these settings, open the :guilabel:`More Configuration Options`
under :guilabel:`Additional Settings` in the cluster form.

.. _set-oplog-size:

Set Oplog Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify the :term:`oplog` size of the {+cluster+}.

For sharded {+cluster+} deployments, this option modifies the oplog 
size of each shard in the {+cluster+}.

This option corresponds to modifying the
:setting:`replication.oplogSizeMB` configuration file option for each
|mongod| in the {+cluster+}.

Specify your desired :guilabel:`Oplog Size` in megabytes in the
input box.

.. warning::

   Reducing the size of the oplog requires removing data from the
   oplog. |service| can't access or restore any oplog entries removed
   as a result of oplog reduction. Consider the ramifications of this
   data loss before you reduce the oplog.

.. important::

   - You can't set the oplog to less than 990 megabytes.
   - |service| places no upper limit in megabytes on the oplog.
     However, |service| returns an error if the oplog size you choose 
     leaves your {+cluster+}'s disk with less than 25 percent of its 
     capacity free.

To check the oplog size:

1. Connect to your {+cluster+} via {+mongosh+}.
2. Authenticate as a user with the :atlasrole:`Atlas admin` role.
3. Run the
   :method:`rs.printReplicationInfo() <rs.printReplicationInfo>` method.

|service| displays the current oplog size and time.

Disk Space Considerations
`````````````````````````

*Don't* reduce the size of the oplog to increase the available disk 
space. Only the oplog collection (``local.oplog.rs``)
can reclaim the space that reducing the oplog size saves. Other
collections don't benefit from reducing oplog storage.

Enforce Index Key Limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable or disable enforcement of the 1024-byte index key limit.
Documents can only be updated or inserted if, for all indexed fields on
the target collection, the corresponding index entries don't exceed
1024 bytes.

If disabled, |mongod| writes documents that breach the limit but
*doesn't* index them. This option corresponds to modifying the
:parameter:`failIndexKeyTooLong <param.failIndexKeyTooLong>`
parameter via the :dbcommand:`setParameter` command for each |mongod|
in the {+cluster+}.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/removed-fail-index-key-too-long.rst

Allow Server-Side JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-javascriptEnabled-description.rst

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/changed-javascript-enabled-mongos.rst

Set Minimum TLS Protocol Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the minimum TLS version that the {+cluster+} accepts for incoming
connections. This option corresponds to configuring the
:setting:`net.ssl.disabledProtocols` configuration file option
for each |mongod| in the {+cluster+}.

.. note:: TLS 1.0 Deprecation

   If you are considering this option as a method for enabling the
   deprecated Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 protocol version, read
   :ref:`faq-tls-1.0-deprecation` before proceeding. |service|
   deprecation of TLS 1.0 improves your security of data-in-transit
   and aligns with industry best practices. Enabling TLS 1.0 for any
   |service| {+cluster+} carries security risks. Consider enabling TLS
   1.0 only for as long as required to update your application stack
   to support TLS 1.1 or later.

Require Indexes for All Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable or disable the execution of queries that require a collection
scan to return results. This option corresponds to modifying the
:parameter:`notablescan <param.notablescan>` parameter via the
:dbcommand:`setParameter` command for each |mongod| in
the {+cluster+}.

Default Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the :manual:`default level of acknowledgment requested from MongoDB for read operations </reference/read-concern/>` for this {+cluster+}.

.. note:: 

   You can set the default read concern only for |service| {+clusters+} 
   that run MongoDB 4.4 or higher.

MongoDB 4.4 {+clusters+} default to :manual:`available
</reference/read-concern-available>`.

Starting with MongoDB 5.0, the default read concern for {+clusters+} is
:manual:`local </reference/read-concern-local>`.

Default Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the 
:manual:`default level of acknowledgment requested from MongoDB for write operations </reference/write-concern/>` for this {+cluster+}.

.. note:: 

   You can set the default write concern only for |service|
   {+clusters+} that run MongoDB 4.4 or higher.

MongoDB 4.4 {+clusters+} default to :manual:`1 
</reference/write-concern>`.

Starting with MongoDB 5.0, the default write concern for {+clusters+}
is :manual:`majority </reference/write-concern>`.

Set Transaction Lifetime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the maximum lifetime of :manual:`multi-document transactions
</core/transactions/>`. This option corresponds to modifying the
:parameter:`transactionLifetimeLimitSeconds
<param.transactionLifetimeLimitSeconds>` parameter via the 
:dbcommand:`setParameter` command for each |mongod| in the {+cluster+}.

.. important::
  
   You can't set the transaction lifetime to less than one second.

Starting with MongoDB 4.0, the transaction lifetime for {+clusters+}
default to 60 seconds.
