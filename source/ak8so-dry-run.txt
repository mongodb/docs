With the |ak8so| Dry Run feature, you can see what |ak8so| is going to change in 
|service|, with those custom resources applied to the K8S cluster. The |ak8so| 
emits events for every resource that it is going to create/update/delete in 
|service|. Events emitted by the |ak8so| running in Dry Run mode can be 
filtered by "Dry Run" reason. This feature is particularly useful for upgrading 
your |ak8so| resources from `v1.9 to v2.x <(for example from 1.9 to 2.x: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/operator/v2.0/upgrade-ako-v1-to-v2/)>`__.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to use the |ak8so| Dry Run feature, you need to:

- Have access to a **new Kubernetes or Open Shift {+cluster+}**.
- Apply |ak8so| custom resources to your **new Kubernetes {+cluster+}**. 
  When you apply your resources, make sure you provide a `secret with credentials <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/operator/stable/ak8so-quick-start/#create-a-secret-with-your-api-keys-and-organization-id>`__.
  You need a new {+cluster+}, because upgrading CRDs on your existing |k8s| {+cluster+} 
  might leave |ak8so| unable to reconcile existing custom resources. Moreover, 
  the CRDs that are applied can be a newer version with potential breaking changes.

  .. note:: 

     Only one version of the AKO CRDs can exist in a specific |k8s| cluster. 
     This means that to test upgrading to a new version of the |ak8so|, you 
     need to deploy a new |k8s| cluster (possibly a temporary cluster) to 
     execute the dry run.

- Install CRDs to your {+cluster+} for the version of the |ak8so| you want to execute dry-run for.
- Create a ``mongodb-atlas-operator`` service account in your |k8s| {+cluster+}. 
- Create a `role <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-atlas-kubernetes/blob/main/config/rbac/clusterwide/role.yaml>`__ 
  and `rolebinding <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-atlas-kubernetes/blob/main/config/rbac/clusterwide/role_binding.yaml>`__ 
  for your `service account <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-atlas-kubernetes/blob/main/config/rbac/service_account.yaml>`__ 
  with the following permissions related to your |ak8so| custom resources. You 
  can either create these resources manually or with the :ref:`Atlas CLI <ak8so-quick-start-ref>`.
  
  - ``list``
  - ``get``
  - ``create``
  - ``update``
  - ``delete`` 

Dry Run Events
--------------

The Dry Run process emits either the following message types, each of which 
can be either of the type ``Normal`` or ``Warning``:

- ``Would [verb] ([HTTP-Method]) [Atlas resource URL]``
  
  - A description of a given |ak8so| resource and the |k8s| required |k8s| 
    process should the change be applied to your |service| environment. When in 
    Dry Run mode, |ak8so| only emits dry-run events for HTTP verbs 
    that would create/update/delete resources in |service|, such as 
    ``POST``, ``PATCH``, ``PUT``, ``DELETE``. 

- ``Done``

  - No further dry-run events will be reported.

- ``Finished``

  - The |k8s| Job running the dry-run process has completed.

Procedure
---------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: kubectl
      :tabid: kubectl-dry-run

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Apply the following |k8s| Job.

            Save the following example in a file called ``dry-run-job.yaml`` 
            and apply it to your {+cluster+} by running ``kubectl apply -f dry-run-job.yaml``. 
            This will start |ak8so| as a |k8s| Job with the ``--dry-run`` parameter. 
            Every reconciliation in the |ak8so| will run only once, emitting 
            events for each resource if there are changes between the resource 
            spec and its state in |service|.

            You can run this command multiple times without making any changes 
            to your |service| resources.

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/dry-run-example.yaml
               :linenos: 
               :copyable:
               :language: yaml

         .. step:: List the dry-run output.

            When the |k8s| Job is finished, you can list the events emitted 
            by running the following command:

            .. code-block:: bash

               kubectl -n mongodb-atlas-system get events --field-selector reason=DryRun

            This command will return output similar to the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

               LAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON   OBJECT                    MESSAGE
               103s        Normal    DryRun   atlasproject/my-project   Would delete (DELETE) /api/atlas/v1.0/groups/6558f184beba40022cbb2043/integrations/SLACK
               101s        Warning   DryRun   atlasproject/my-project   finished dry run

   .. tab:: Atlas CLI 
      :tabid: atlas-cli-dry-run

      .. procedure:: 
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Install the |ak8so| CRDs, RBAC and Service Account resources.

            .. code-block:: bash

               atlas kubernetes operator install --targetNamespace=mongodb-atlas-system --config-only

         .. step:: Run the following Atlas CLI command.

            Run the following |service| CLI command to start the dry run process. 
            You can run this command multiple times without making any changes 
            to your |service| resources.

            .. code-block:: bash

               atlas kubernetes dry-run --targetNamespace=mongodb-atlas-system --watch

            .. note:: 

               If the ``--watch`` flag is not provided, the |service| CLI exits  
               after completing the installation.

         .. step:: List the dry-run output.

            When the |k8s| Job is finished, you can list the events emitted 
            by running the following command:

            .. code-block:: bash

               kubectl -n mongodb-atlas-system get events --field-selector reason=DryRun

            This command will return output similar to the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

               LAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON   OBJECT                    MESSAGE
               103s        Normal    DryRun   atlasproject/my-project   Would delete (DELETE) /api/atlas/v1.0/groups/6558f184beba40022cbb2043/integrations/SLACK
               101s        Warning   DryRun   atlasproject/my-project   finished dry run
