|service| supports `Network Peering <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_cloud>`_
connections for |aws|, |gcp|, and |azure|-backed clusters.

.. important::

   To set up a Network Peering connection, you must have either the
   :authrole:`Project Owner` or :authrole:`Organization Owner` role.

Configure an |service| Network Peering Connection
-------------------------------------------------

To configure |service| Network Peering for a cluster, perform the
procedure on the tab corresponding to your cluster's cloud provider.
You also configure the |service| |vpc| |cidr| during this procedure.

See :doc:`Create a New Network Peering Container 
</reference/api/vpc-create-container>` to configure the |service| 
|cidr| separately without configuring Network Peering.
You must use the API to configure the |service| |cidr| separately.

         1. In the :guilabel:`Security` section of the left navigation,
            click :guilabel:`Network Access`.

         #. In the :guilabel:`Peering` tab, click :icon-fa5:`plus`
            :guilabel:`New Peering Connection`.

         #. Enable :guilabel:`DNS hostnames` and :guilabel:`DNS resolution` in |aws|:

            a. Log in to your |aws| account.

            #. Go to the
               `VPC dashboard <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc>`_.

            #. Open your list of |vpc| resources.

            #. Select the |vpc| you want to peer with.

            #. Enable :guilabel:`DNS hostnames` and :guilabel:`DNS
               resolution`. To learn more about how to enable these options, see :aws:`Updating DNS Support for Your VPC </AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-updating>`.

            .. note::
               If :guilabel:`DNS hostnames` and :guilabel:`DNS resolution` are disabled and the 
               :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>` is accessible to the internet, the DNS resolves to the public 
               |ipaddr| address rather than the internal |ipaddr| address. In addition, enabling 
               these settings results in faster :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>` peering.

         #.  Go to :guilabel:`Network Access` view in |service|.

             In the :guilabel:`Security` section of the left
             navigation, click :guilabel:`Network Access`.

                   You can choose to add the |vpc| |cidr| block address
                   (or a subset) to the whitelist. For Network Peering
                   connections, you can also add the Security Group
                   associated with the |aws| |vpc| instead of the
                   |cidr| block. See :ref:`add-to-whitelist`.

         #. Click :guilabel:`Initiate Peering`.

         #. Wait for approval of peering connection request

            The owner of the peer |vpc| must approve the |vpc| peering
            connection request. Ensure that the owner approves the
            request.

            |service| provides instructions for approving the connection request.

            #. Add the AWS Peering Connection ID to the
               :guilabel:`Target` column.

               This value is prefixed with ``pcx-``.

               Once set up, you can edit or terminate |vpc| peering
               connection from the :guilabel:`Peering` table.

               You must add your |vpc| |cidr| block address (or subset)
               or the Security Group associated with the peer |vpc| to
               the :ref:`whitelist <whitelist>` before your new |vpc|
               peer can connect to your |service| cluster.
