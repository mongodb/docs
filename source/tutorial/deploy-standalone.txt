====================================
Deploy a Standalone MongoDB Instance
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can deploy a :term:`standalone` MongoDB instance managed by |mms|. Use
standalone instances for testing and development.
**Do not** use these deployments, which lack replication and high
availability, for production systems. For all production deployments
use replica sets. See :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set` for
production deployments.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must have an existing server to which to deploy. For testing purposes,
you can use your localhost, or another machine to which you have access.

.. only:: cloud

   You can also deploy to a server on Amazon Web Services. See:
   :doc:`/tutorial/provision-aws-servers` for more about configuring
   and provisioning AWS servers with |mms|.

.. important::

   If you provision your own server and if you use :term:`MongoDB
   Enterprise`, you must install the :ref:`prerequisite packages
   <mongodb-enterprise-dependencies>` to the server before deploying
   MongoDB Enterprise on it.
