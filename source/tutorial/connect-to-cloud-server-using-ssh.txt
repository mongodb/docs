Overview
--------

If you provision servers through |mms|'s integration with a cloud service
provider, you can use SSH to connect to your servers.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: sh

      ssh -i <ssh-key> <username>@<hostsring>.mongodbdns.com

Prerequisites
-------------

If you provision servers through **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, you must
meet the following prerequisites:

- The AWS :ref:`security group <security-group>` assigned to the AWS
  server must allow SSH access from your IP address. For more information,
  see :ref:`security-group`.

- To connect to the AWS server through SSH, you must have the private key that
  matches the shared public key you created when provisioning the
  server.
