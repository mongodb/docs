Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to store and retrieve large files in
MongoDB by using **GridFS**. GridFS is a specification implemented by 
the {+php-library+} that describes how to split files into chunks when storing them
and reassemble them when retrieving them. The library's implementation of
GridFS is an abstraction that manages the operations and organization of
the file storage. 

Use GridFS if the size of your files exceeds the BSON document
size limit of 16MB. For more detailed information on whether GridFS is
suitable for your use case, see :manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs>` in the
{+mdb-server+} manual.

How GridFS Works
----------------

GridFS organizes files in a **bucket**, a group of MongoDB collections
that contain the chunks of files and information describing them. The
bucket contains the following collections, named using the convention
defined in the GridFS specification:

- The ``chunks`` collection stores the binary file chunks.
- The ``files`` collection stores the file metadata.

When you create a new GridFS bucket, the library creates the preceding 
collections, prefixed with the default bucket name ``fs``, unless
you specify a different name. The library also creates an index on each
collection to ensure efficient retrieval of the files and related
metadata. The library creates the GridFS bucket, if it doesn't exist, only when the first write
operation is performed. The library creates indexes only if they don't exist and when the
bucket is empty. For more information about
GridFS indexes, see :manual:`GridFS Indexes </core/gridfs/#gridfs-indexes>`
in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

When using GridFS to store files, the library splits the files into smaller
chunks, each represented by a separate document in the ``chunks`` collection.
It also creates a document in the ``files`` collection that contains
a file ID, file name, and other file metadata. You can upload the file by passing
a stream to the {+php-library+} to consume or creating a new stream and writing to it
directly. To learn more about streams, see :php:`Streams <book.stream>`
in the PHP manual.

View the following diagram to see how GridFS splits the files when uploaded to
a bucket:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/GridFS-upload.png
   :alt: A diagram that shows how GridFS uploads a file to a bucket

When retrieving files, GridFS fetches the metadata from the ``files``
collection in the specified bucket and uses the information to reconstruct
the file from documents in the ``chunks`` collection. You can read the file
by writing its contents to an existing stream or creating a new stream that points
to the file.

.. _gridfs-create-bucket:

Create a GridFS Bucket
----------------------

To store or retrieve files from GridFS, call the ``MongoDB\Database::selectGridFSBucket()``
method on your database. This method accesses an existing bucket or creates
a new bucket if one does not exist.

The following example calls the ``selectGridFSBucket()`` method on the ``db``
database:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-create-bucket
   :end-before: end-create-bucket

.. _gridfs-create-custom-bucket:

Customize the Bucket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can customize the GridFS bucket configuration by passing an array that specifies
option values to the ``selectGridFSBucket()`` method. The following table describes
some options you can set in the array:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Description

   * - ``bucketName`` 
     - | Specifies the bucket name to use as a prefix for the files and chunks collections.
         The default value is ``'fs'``.
       | **Type**: ``string``

   * - ``chunkSizeBytes`` 
     - | Specifies the chunk size that GridFS splits files into. The default value is ``261120``.
       | **Type**: ``integer``

   * - ``readConcern`` 
     - | Specifies the read concern to use for bucket operations. The default value is the 
         database's read concern.
       | **Type**: ``MongoDB\Driver\ReadConcern``

   * - ``readPreference`` 
     - | Specifies the read preference to use for bucket operations. The default value is the 
         database's read preference.
       | **Type**: ``MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference``

   * - ``writeConcern`` 
     - | Specifies the write concern to use for bucket operations. The default value is the 
         database's write concern.
       | **Type**: ``MongoDB\Driver\WriteConcern``

The following example creates a bucket named ``'myCustomBucket'`` by passing an
array to ``selectGridFSBucket()`` that sets the ``bucketName`` option:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-create-custom-bucket
   :end-before: end-create-custom-bucket

.. _gridfs-upload-files:

Upload Files
------------

You can upload files to a GridFS bucket by using the following methods:

- ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::openUploadStream()``: Opens a new upload stream
  to which you can write file contents
- ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::uploadFromStream()``: Uploads the contents of
  an existing stream to a GridFS file

.. _gridfs-open-upload-stream:

Write to an Upload Stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``openUploadStream()`` method to create an upload stream for a given
file name. The ``openUploadStream()`` method allows you to specify configuration
information in an options array, which you can pass as a parameter.

This example uses an upload stream to perform the following
actions:

- Opens a writable stream for a new GridFS file named ``'my_file'``
- Sets the ``metadata`` option in an array parameter
  to the ``openUploadStream()`` method
- Calls the ``fwrite()`` method to write data to ``'my_file'``, which the stream points to
- Calls the ``fclose()`` method to close the stream pointing to ``'my_file'`` 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-open-upload-stream
   :end-before: end-open-upload-stream

Upload an Existing Stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``uploadFromStream()`` method to upload the contents of a stream to
a new GridFS file. The ``uploadFromStream()`` method allows you to specify configuration
information in an options array, which you can pass as a parameter.

This example performs the following actions:

- Calls the ``fopen()`` method to open a file located at ``/path/to/input_file``
  as a stream in binary read (``rb``) mode
- Calls the ``uploadFromStream()`` method to upload the contents of the stream
  to a GridFS file named ``'new_file'`` 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-upload-from-stream
   :end-before: end-upload-from-stream

.. _gridfs-retrieve-file-info:

Retrieve File Information
-------------------------

In this section, you can learn how to retrieve file metadata stored in the
``files`` collection of the GridFS bucket. The metadata contains information
about the file it refers to, including:

- The ``_id`` of the file
- The name of the file
- The length/size of the file
- The upload date and time
- A ``metadata`` document in which you can store any other information

To retrieve files from a GridFS bucket, call the ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::find()``
method on the ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket`` instance. The method returns a ``MongoDB\Driver\Cursor``
instance from which you can access the results. To learn more about ``Cursor`` objects in
the {+php-library+}, see the :ref:`<php-cursors>` guide.

Example 
~~~~~~~

The following code example shows you how to retrieve and print file metadata
from files in a GridFS bucket. It uses a ``foreach`` loop to iterate through
the returned cursor and display the contents of the files uploaded in the
:ref:`gridfs-upload-files` examples:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
      :start-after: start-retrieve-file-info
      :end-before: end-retrieve-file-info
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      { "_id" : { "$oid" : "..." }, "chunkSize" : 261120, "filename" : "my_file",
      "length" : 13, "uploadDate" : { ... }, "metadata" : {
      "contentType" : "text/plain" } }
      { "_id" : { "$oid" : "..." }, "chunkSize" : 261120, "filename" : "new_file",
      "length" : 13, "uploadDate" : { ... } }

The ``find()`` method accepts various query specifications. You can use its
``$options`` parameter to specify the sort order, maximum number of documents to return,
and the number of documents to skip before returning. To view a list of available
options, see the `API documentation <{+api+}/method/MongoDBGridFSBucket-find/#parameters>`__.

.. note::

   The preceding example calls the ``toJSON()`` method to print file metadata as 
   Extended JSON, defined in the following code:

   .. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
      :language: php
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-to-json
      :end-before: end-to-json

.. _gridfs-download-files:

Download Files
--------------

You can download files from a GridFS bucket by using the following methods:

- ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::openDownloadStreamByName()`` or
  ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::openDownloadStream()``: Opens a new download stream
  from which you can read the file contents
- ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::downloadToStream()``: Writes the entire file to
  an existing download stream

Read From a Download Stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download files from your MongoDB database by using the
``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::openDownloadStreamByName()`` method to
create a download stream.

This example uses a download stream to perform the following actions:

- Selects a GridFS file named ``'my_file'``, uploaded in the
  :ref:`gridfs-open-upload-stream` example, and opens it as a readable stream 
- Calls the ``stream_get_contents()`` method to read the contents of ``'my_file'``
- Prints the file contents
- Calls the ``fclose()`` method to close the download stream pointing to ``'my_file'`` 

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
      :start-after: start-open-download-stream-name
      :end-before: end-open-download-stream-name
      :language: php
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      "Data to store"

.. note::

   If there are multiple documents with the same file name,
   GridFS will stream the most recent file with the given name (as
   determined by the ``uploadDate`` field).

Alternatively, you can use the ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::openDownloadStream()``
method, which takes the ``_id`` field of a file as a parameter:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-download-files-id
   :end-before: end-download-files-id

.. note::

   The GridFS streaming API cannot load partial chunks. When a download
   stream needs to pull a chunk from MongoDB, it pulls the entire chunk
   into memory. The 255-kilobyte default chunk size is usually
   sufficient, but you can reduce the chunk size to reduce memory
   overhead or increase the chunk size when working with larger files.
   For more information about setting the chunk size, see the 
   :ref:`gridfs-create-custom-bucket` section of this page.

Download a File Revision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When your bucket contains multiple files that share the same file name,
GridFS chooses the most recently uploaded version of the file by default.
To differentiate between each file that shares the same name, GridFS assigns them
a revision number, ordered by upload time.

The original file revision number is ``0`` and the next most recent file revision
number is ``1``. You can also specify negative values that correspond to the recency
of the revision. The revision value ``-1`` references the most recent revision and ``-2``
references the next most recent revision.

You can instruct GridFS to download a specific file revision by passing an options
array to the ``openDownloadStreamByName()`` method and specifying the ``revision``
option. The following example reads the contents of the original file named
``'my_file'`` rather than the most recent revision:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-download-file-revision
   :end-before: end-download-file-revision

Download to an Existing Stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download the contents of a GridFS file to an existing stream
by calling the ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::downloadToStream()`` method
on your bucket.

This example performs the following actions:

- Calls the ``fopen()`` method to open a file located at ``/path/to/output_file``
  as a stream in binary write (``wb``) mode
- Downloads a GridFS file that has an ``_id`` value of ``ObjectId('66e0a5487c880f844c0a32b1')``
  to the stream

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-download-to-stream
   :end-before: end-download-to-stream

.. _gridfs-rename-files:

Rename Files
------------

Use the ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::rename()`` method to update the name of
a GridFS file in your bucket. Pass the following parameters to the ``rename()``
method:

-  ``_id`` value of the file you want to rename
- New file name

The following example shows how to update the ``filename`` field to
``'new_file_name'`` by referencing a file's ``_id`` value:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-rename-files-id
   :end-before: end-rename-files-id

Alternatively, you can use the ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::renameByName()``
method to rename a GridFS file and all its file revisions. Pass the 
following parameters to the ``renameByName()`` method:

- ``filename`` value you want to change
- New file name

The following example renames all files that have a ``filename`` value
of ``'my_file'``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-rename-files-name
   :end-before: end-rename-files-name

.. _gridfs-delete-files:

Delete Files
------------

Use the ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::delete()`` method to remove a GridFS file's collection
document and associated chunks from your bucket. This effectively deletes the file.
Pass the ``_id`` value of the file you want to delete as a parameter to the
``delete()`` method.

The following example shows you how to delete a file by referencing its ``_id`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-delete-files-id
   :end-before: end-delete-files-id

Alternatively, you can use the ``MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::deleteByName()`` method
to delete a GridFS file and all its file revisions. Pass the ``filename`` value of the
file you want to delete as a parameter to the ``deleteByName()`` method, as shown
in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/gridfs.php
   :language: php
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-delete-files-name
   :end-before: end-delete-files-name
