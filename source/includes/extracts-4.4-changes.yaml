ref: 4.4-validate-options
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, for the WiredTiger storage engine, you can
   run the :dbcommand:`validate` command in the background or in the
   foreground. In earlier versions, you can only run
   :dbcommand:`validate` in the foreground:

   - When run in |background|, the operation takes an intent shared
     lock on the collection and does not block reads and writes or DDL
     operations on the collection; however, the operation does not
     update collection count and size metrics.
 
   - When run in |foreground|, the operation takes an exclusive lock on
     the collection and blocks all reads and writes and DDL operations
     on the collection until the operation finishes. When run on a
     secondary, the operation can block all other operations on that
     secondary until it finishes.

ref: 4.4-changes-passwordPrompt
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, if you use the
   ``db.auth(<username>, <password>)`` syntax and omit the password,
   the user is prompted to enter a password.
---
ref: 4.4-changes-removed-commands
content: |
   MongoDB removes the following command(s) and :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
   helper(s):

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 25 55
   
      * - Removed Command
        - Removed Helper
        - Alternatives
     
      * - ``cloneCollection``
   
        - ``db.cloneCollection()``

        - - Use :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` and
            :binary:`~bin.mongoimport`, or

          - Use the aggregation pipeline :pipeline:`$out` or
            :pipeline:`$merge` stages, or
 
          - Write a script using the drivers.

      * - ``planCacheListPlans``
   
        - ``PlanCache.getPlansByQuery()``

        - - Use the aggregation pipeline stage :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` or

          - Use the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell helper method
            :method:`PlanCache.list()`. (Available starting in version 4.4)

          | See also :ref:`4.4-agg-planCachesStats-changes`.

      * - ``planCacheListQueryShapes``

        - ``PlanCache.listQueryShapes()``

        - - Use the aggregation pipeline stage :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` or
 
          - Use the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell helper method

ref: 4.4-changes-removed-parameters
content: |
   MongoDB removes the following server parameter:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 25 75
   
      * - Removed Parameter
        - Description
     
      * - ``failIndexKeyTooLong``
   
        - MongoDB 4.4 removes the ``failIndexKeyTooLong`` parameter.
          This parameter was deprecated in 4.2 as MongoDB with
          :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <view-fcv>` (fCV) version
          4.2+ no longer imposes an :limit:`Index Key Limit`. 

---
ref: 4.4-changes-planCache-changes
content: |

   Starting in version 4.4, 
   
   - :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` stage can be run on
     :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances as well as on
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. In 4.2,
     :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` stage can only run on
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

   - :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` includes new fields: the :ref:`host
     <plancachestats-host>` field and, when run against a
     :binary:`~bin.mongos`, the :ref:`shard <plancachestats-shard>`
     field.

   - :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the method
     :method:`PlanCache.list()` as a wrapper for
     :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` aggregation stage.

   - MongoDB removes the following:

     - ``planCacheListPlans`` and ``planCacheListQueryShapes``
       commands, and

     - ``PlanCache.getPlansByQuery()`` and
       ``PlanCache.listQueryShapes()`` methods.

     Use :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` or :method:`PlanCache.list()` instead.
---
ref: 4.4-changes-rollback-directory
content: |
   Starting in Mongo 4.4, the rollback directory for a collection is named
   after the collection's UUID rather than the collection namespace; e.g.

   .. code-block:: none
      :copyable: false

      <dbpath>/rollback/20f74796-d5ea-42f5-8c95-f79b39bad190/removed.2020-02-19T04-57-11.0.bson

   For details, see :ref:`replica-set-rollback-data`.

---
ref: 4.4-changes-timestamp-format
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, |timestampfmt| no longer supports ``ctime``.
   An example of ``ctime`` formatted date is: ``Wed Dec 31
   18:17:54.811``.
---
ref: 4.4-changes-meta-convergence
content: |

   As of MongoDB 4.4, there is no distinction between
   the :expression:`$meta` aggregation operator and the
   :projection:`$meta` projection operator.
      
---
ref: 4.4-changes-projection-sort-meta-list
content: |

   - Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can specify the :projection:`{ $meta:
     "textScore" } <$meta>` expression in the :method:`~cursor.sort()`
     without also specifying the expression in the projection. For example,

     .. code-block:: javascript 

        db.articles.find( 
           { $text: { $search: "cake" } } 
        ).sort( { score: { $meta: "textScore" } } )

     As a result, you can sort the resulting documents by their search
     relevance without projecting the ``textScore``.

     | In earlier versions, to include :projection:`{ $meta: "textScore" }
       <$meta>` expression in the :method:`~cursor.sort()`, you must also
       include the same expression in the projection.

   - Starting in MongoDB 4.4, if you include the :projection:`{ $meta:
     "textScore" } <$meta>` expression in both the :ref:`projection
     <find-projection>` and :method:`~cursor.sort()`, the projection and
     sort documents can have different field names for the expression.

     | For example, in the following operation, the projection uses a
      field named  ``score`` for the expression and the :method:`~cursor.sort()`
      uses the field named ``ignoredName``.

     .. code-block:: javascript 

        db.articles.find(
           { $text: { $search: "cake" } } , 
           { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
        ).sort( { ignoredName: { $meta: "textScore" } } )

     In previous versions of MongoDB, if ``{ $meta: "textScore" }`` is
     included in both the projection and sort, you must specify the
     same field name for the expression.

---
ref: 4.4-changes-textscore-predicate
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you must specify the :query:`$text` operator
   in the query predicate of the :method:`db.collection.find()` operations
   to use :projection:`{ $meta: "textScore" } <$meta>` expression in the
   projection or sort. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.articles.find(
         { $text: { $search: "cake" } },
         { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
      );

      db.articles.find(
         { $text: { $search: "cake" } },
         { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
      ).sort( { score: {  $meta: "textScore" } } );
   

   If you do not specify the :query:`$text` operator in the query
   predicate, the operation fails. For example, the following operations are
   invalid starting in MongoDB 4.4:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.articles.find(
         { },
         { score: { $meta: "textScore" } } 
      )

      db.articles.find(
         { },
         { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
      ).sort( { score: {  $meta: "textScore" } } );
   
---
ref: 4.4-changes-natural-sort-views
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can specify a :operator:`$natural`
   sort when running a :dbcommand:`find` operation against a
   :doc:`view </core/views>`.
---
ref: 4.4-changes-drop-in-progress-indexes
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :method:`db.collection.drop()` method and
   :dbcommand:`drop` command abort any in-progress index builds on the
   target collection before dropping the collection. Prior to MongoDB
   4.4, attempting to drop a collection with in-progress index builds
   results in an error, and the collection is not dropped.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-abort-index-build-replica-sets.rst
---
ref: 4.4-changes-drop-database-in-progress-indexes
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :method:`db.dropDatabase()` method and
   :dbcommand:`dropDatabase` command abort any in-progress index builds
   on collections in the target database before dropping the database.
   Aborting an index build has the same effect as dropping the built
   index. Prior to MongoDB 4.4, attempting to drop a database that
   contains a collection with an in-progress index build results in an
   error, and the database is not dropped.

---
ref: 4.4-changes-minimum-oplog-retention-period
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can specify the minimum number of hours
   to preserve an oplog entry. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` only removes
   an oplog entry *if*:

   - The oplog has reached the :ref:`maximum configured size
     <replica-set-oplog-sizing>`, *and* 

   - The oplog entry is older than the configured number of hours based
     on the host system clock.

   By default MongoDB does not set a minimum oplog retention period and
   automatically truncates the oplog starting with the oldest entries to
   maintain the configured maximum oplog size.

ref: 4.4-changes-transactions-upsert
content: |

   For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.4"``
   and greater, if the operation is specified on a non-existing
   collection and results in an upsert, the collection is implicitly
   created.

   .. note::

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-cross-shard-collection-restriction.rst

   For fcv ``"4.2"`` or less, if the operation results in an upsert,
   the collection must already exist.
---
ref: 4.4-changes-transactions-insert
content: |

   For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.4"``
   and greater, if you specify an insert on a non-existing collection in
   a transaction, the collection is implicitly created.

   .. note::

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-cross-shard-collection-restriction.rst

   For fcv ``"4.2"`` or less, insert operations that would result in
   the creation of a new collection are not allowed in a transaction.
---
ref: 4.4-changes-transactions-bulkWrite
content: |

   For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.4"``
   and greater, if an insert operation or update operation with
   ``upsert: true`` is run in a transaction against a non-existing
   collection, the collection is implicitly created.

   .. note::

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-cross-shard-collection-restriction.rst

   For fcv ``"4.2"`` or less, the collection must already exist for
   insert and ``upsert: true`` operations.

ref: 4.4-changes-transactions-save
content: |

   For :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` ``"4.4"``
   and greater, if you save a document to a non-existing collection in a
   transaction, the collection is implicitly created.

   .. note::

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-cross-shard-collection-restriction.rst

   For fcv ``"4.2"`` or less, :method:`~db.collection.save()`
   operations that would result in the creation of a new collection are

ref: 4.4-changes-geo-deprecation
content: |
   MongoDB 4.4 deprecates the :doc:`geoHaystack </core/geohaystack>` index and the

      :class: note
   
      Each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the replica set or sharded cluster
      *must* have :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <set-fcv>` set to at
      least ``4.4`` to start index builds simultaneously across 
      replica set members.
   
      MongoDB 4.4 running ``featureCompatibilityVersion: "4.2"`` builds
      indexes on the primary before replicating the index build to
      secondaries.

---
ref: 4.4-changes-index-builds-simultaneous
content: |

   Starting with MongoDB 4.4, index builds on a replica set or sharded
   cluster build simultaneously across all data-bearing replica set
   members. For sharded clusters, the index build occurs only on shards
   containing data for the collection being indexed. The primary
   requires a minimum number of data-bearing :rsconf:`voting
   <members[n].votes>` members (i.e commit quorum), including itself,
   that must complete the build before marking the index as ready for
   use. See :ref:`index-operations-replicated-build` for more
   information.

ref: 4.4-changes-migrate-jumbo-chunks
content: |
   For chunks that are :ref:`too large to migrate
   <migration-chunk-size-limit>`, starting in MongoDB 4.4:

   - A new balancer setting ``attemptToBalanceJumboChunks`` allows the
     balancer to migrate chunks too large to move as long as the chunks
     are not labeled :ref:`jumbo <jumbo-chunk>`. See
     :ref:`balance-chunks-that-exceed-size-limit` for details.

   - The :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command can specify a new option
     :ref:`forceJumbo <movechunk-forceJumbo>` to allow for the
     migration of chunks that are too large to move. The chunks may or
     may not be labeled :ref:`jumbo <jumbo-chunk>`.
