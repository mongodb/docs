.. note::

   |mms| can manage the :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` processes for
   your MongoDB deployment. If |mms| is not managing any of these processes
   in your deployment, you can reset :guilabel:`Authentication and SSL`
   settings for your group. 

   If you have not unmanaged the process first, see 
   :doc:`/tutorial/unmanage-deployment`. 

   To remove all authentication and security settings as well as the users and
   roles you created using |mms|, click :guilabel:`Clear Settings` in the
   :guilabel:`Authentication & SSL Settings` dialog box .

   See :doc:`/tutorial/clear-security-settings` for more information.
