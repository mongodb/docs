=======================
db.collection.reIndex()
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: db.collection.reIndex()

   This method drops all indexes and recreates them. This operation
   may be expensive for collections that have a large amount of data
   and/or a large number of indexes.

   Call this method, which takes no arguments, on a collection
   object. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.reIndex()

   Change ``collection`` to the name of the collection that you want
   to rebuild the index.

.. see:: :doc:`/core/index-creation` for more information on the
   behavior of indexing operations in MongoDB.
