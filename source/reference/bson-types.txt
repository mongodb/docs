BSON Types
==========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

:term:`BSON` is a binary serialization format used to store documents
and make remote procedure calls in MongoDB. The BSON specification is
located at `bsonspec.org <http://bsonspec.org/>`_.

BSON supports the following data types as values in documents. Each data
type has a corresponding number that can be used with the
:query:`$type` operator to query documents by BSON type.

=======================  ==========
**Type**                 **Number**

Double                       1

To determine a field's type, see :ref:`check-types-in-shell`.

If you convert BSON to JSON, see
:ref:`bson-json-type-conversion-fidelity` for more information.

The next sections describe special considerations for particular BSON
types.

.. _document-bson-type-object-id:

ObjectId
--------

ObjectIds are: small, likely unique, fast to generate, and ordered.
These values consists of 12-bytes, where the first four bytes are a
timestamp that reflect the ObjectId's creation. Refer to the
:doc:`ObjectId </reference/object-id>` documentation for more
information.

.. _document-bson-type-string:

String
------

BSON strings are UTF-8. In general, drivers for each programming
language convert from the language's string format to UTF-8 when
serializing and deserializing BSON. This makes it possible to store
most international characters in BSON strings with ease.
[#sort-string-internationalization]_ In addition, MongoDB
:query:`$regex` queries support UTF-8 in the regex string.

.. [#sort-string-internationalization] Given strings using UTF-8
   character sets, using :method:`sort() <cursor.sort()>` on strings
   will be reasonably correct. However, because internally
   :method:`sort() <cursor.sort()>` uses the C++ ``strcmp`` api, the
   sort order may handle some characters incorrectly.

.. _document-bson-type-timestamp:

Timestamps
----------

BSON has a special timestamp type for *internal* MongoDB use and is
**not** associated with the regular :ref:`document-bson-type-date`
type. Timestamp values are a 64 bit value where:

- the first 32 bits are a ``time_t`` value (seconds since the Unix epoch)

- the second 32 bits are an incrementing ``ordinal`` for operations
  within a given second.

Within a single :program:`mongod` instance, timestamp values are
always unique.

In replication, the :term:`oplog` has a ``ts`` field. The values in
this field reflect the operation time, which uses a BSON timestamp
value.

.. note::

   The BSON Timestamp type is for *internal* MongoDB use. For most
   cases, in application development, you will want to use the BSON
   date type. See :ref:`document-bson-type-date` for more
   information.

If you create a BSON Timestamp using the empty constructor (e.g. ``new
Timestamp()``), MongoDB will only generate a timestamp *if* you use
the constructor in the first field of the document. [#id_exception]_
Otherwise, MongoDB will generate an empty timestamp value
(i.e. ``Timestamp(0, 0)``.)

.. versionchanged:: 2.1
   :program:`mongo` shell displays the Timestamp value with the wrapper:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      Timestamp(<time_t>, <ordinal>)

   Prior to version 2.1, the :program:`mongo` shell display the
   Timestamp value as a document:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { t : <time_t>, i : <ordinal> }

.. [#id_exception] If the first field in the document is ``_id``, then
   you can generate a timestamp in the *second* field
   of a document.

   .. only:: html or dirhtml or singlehtml or epub or gettext

      In the following example, MongoDB will generate a Timestamp
      value, even though the ``Timestamp()`` constructor is *not* in
      the first field in the document:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.bios.insert( { _id: 9, last_updated: new Timestamp() } )

.. _document-bson-type-date:

Date
----

BSON Date is a 64-bit integer that represents the number of
milliseconds since the Unix epoch (Jan 1, 1970). The `official BSON
specification <http://bsonspec.org/#/specification>`_ refers to the
BSON Date type as the *UTC datetime*.

.. versionchanged:: 2.0
   BSON Date type is signed. [#unsigned-date]_ Negative values
   represent dates before 1970.

.. example:: Construct a Date using the ``new Date()`` constructor in the
   :program:`mongo` shell:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var mydate1 = new Date()

.. example:: Construct a Date using the ``ISODate()`` constructor in the
   :program:`mongo` shell:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var mydate2 = ISODate()

.. example:: Return the ``Date`` value as string:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mydate1.toString()

.. example:: Return the month portion of the Date value; months are zero-indexed,
   so that January is month ``0``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      mydate1.getMonth()

.. [#unsigned-date] Prior to version 2.0, ``Date`` values were
   incorrectly interpreted as *unsigned* integers, which affected
   sorts, range queries, and indexes on ``Date`` fields. Because
   indexes are not recreated when upgrading, please re-index if you
   created an index on ``Date`` values with an earlier version, and
   dates before 1970 are relevant to your application.
