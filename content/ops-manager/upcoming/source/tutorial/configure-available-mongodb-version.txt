Add a Custom MongoDB Build
==========================

.. meta::
   :description: Add custom MongoDB builds to Ops Manager for specific platform needs, specifying version, download URL, git version, and any additional modules.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can add custom-built versions of MongoDB for |mms| to download.
Automation downloads these MongoDB versions "lazily": downloading
binaries for a version of MongoDB when a MongoDB process uses that
version on a managed host.

.. warning:: Serving Custom Builds when |onprem| runs without Internet access

   If you want to download a Custom Build from your |onprem| host:

   1. Run |onprem| and its {+mdbagent+}s without
      :doc:`access to the Internet </tutorial/configure-local-mode>`.

   #. Upload the Custom Build binary to the
      :setting:`Versions Directory` folder on the |onprem| host.

   #. Provide the full |url| to the Custom Build in the
      |application| per the "Complete the :guilabel:`Add Custom Build` form" step
      in this procedure.

   |onprem| can't serve your Custom Build binaries if it or its
   Agents have Internet access. When |onprem|, the Agents, or both
   have Internet access, they download the Custom Build binaries
   direct from the source over the Internet. These Custom Build
   binaries aren't stored on the |onprem| host in this scenario.

   |onprem| can't backup deployments that use third-party custom
   builds. It does support custom builds that MongoDB provides.

Add a Custom Build
------------------

The existing versions of MongoDB may not meet your immediate needs.
You can provide other versions of MongoDB through the
:guilabel:`Custom Builds` functionality.
