In sharded clusters, you can create zones that represent a group of shards and
associate one or more ranges of :term:`shard key` values to that zone. MongoDB
routes reads and writes that fall into a zone range only to those shards
inside of the zone.

Add Shards to a Zone
--------------------

Associate a Zone with a particular shard using the
:method:`sh.addShardToZone()` method when connected to a :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instance. A single shard may have multiple zones, and multiple shards
may also have the same zone.

.. example::

   The following example adds the zone ``NYC`` to two shards, and the zones
   ``SFO`` and ``NRT`` to a third shard:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.addShardToZone("shard0000", "NYC")
      sh.addShardToZone("shard0001", "NYC")
      sh.addShardToZone("shard0002", "SFO")
      sh.addShardToZone("shard0002", "NRT")

You may remove zone from a particular shard using the
:method:`sh.removeShardFromZone()` method when connected to a
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, as in the following example, which removes
the ``NRT`` zone from a shard:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.removeShardFromZone("shard0002", "NRT")

Create a Zone Range
-------------------

To define the zone's range of shard keys, use the :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()`
method when connected to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance. Any given shard key
range may only have *one* assigned zone. You cannot overlap defined ranges.

.. example::

   Given a collection named ``users`` in the ``records`` database,
   sharded by the ``zipcode`` field. The following operations assign:

   - two ranges of zip codes in Manhattan and Brooklyn the ``NYC`` zone

   - one range of zip codes in San Francisco the ``SFO`` zone

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.updateZoneKeyRange("records.users", { zipcode: "10001" }, { zipcode: "10281" }, "NYC")
      sh.updateZoneKeyRange("records.users", { zipcode: "11201" }, { zipcode: "11240" }, "NYC")
      sh.updateZoneKeyRange("records.users", { zipcode: "94102" }, { zipcode: "94135" }, "SFO")

Remove a Zone Range
-------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.4
   Use the shell helper method :method:`sh.removeRangeFromZone()` to
   remove a range from a zone.

.. example::

   The following example removes the ``NYC`` zone assignment for the
   range of zip codes within Manhattan:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.removeRangeFromZone("records.user", {zipcode: "10001"}, {zipcode: "10281"})

.. note::

View Existing Zones
-------------------

Use :method:`sh.status()` to list the zones associated to each shard in the
cluster. You can also view a shards zones by querying the
:data:`~config.shards` collection in the ``config`` database. 

The following example uses the :method:`~db.collection.find()` method to
return all shards with the ``NYC`` zone.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use config
   db.shards.find({ tags: "NYC" })

You can find zone ranges for all :term:`namespaces <namespace>` in the
:data:`~config.tags` collection of the ``config`` database. The output
of :method:`sh.status()` also displays all zone ranges.

The following example uses the :method:`~db.collection.find()` method to
return any range associated to the ``NYC`` zone.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use config
   db.tags.find({ tag: "NYC" })
