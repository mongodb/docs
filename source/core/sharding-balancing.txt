Sharded Collection Balancing
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Balancing is the process MongoDB uses to distribute data of a sharded
collection evenly across a :term:`sharded cluster`. When a
:term:`shard` has too many of a sharded collection's :term:`chunks
<chunk>` compared to other shards, MongoDB automatically balances
the chunks across the shards. The balancing procedure for
:term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` is entirely transparent to
the user and application layer.

Cluster Balancer
----------------

The :term:`balancer` process is responsible for redistributing the
chunks of a sharded collection evenly among the shards for every
sharded collection. By default, the balancer process is always enabled.

Any :program:`mongos` instance in the cluster can start a balancing
round. When a balancer process is active, the responsible
:program:`mongos` acquires a "lock" by modifying a document in the
``lock`` collection in the :ref:`config-database`.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

   With replica set config servers, clock skew does not affect
   distributed lock management. If you are using *mirrored* config
   servers, large differences in timekeeping can lead to failed
   distributed locks. With *mirrored* config servers, minimize clock skew
   by running the network time protocol (NTP) ``ntpd`` on your servers.

To address uneven chunk distribution for a sharded collection, the
balancer :doc:`migrates chunks </core/sharding-chunk-migration>` from
shards with more chunks to shards with a fewer number of chunks. The
balancer migrates the chunks, one at a time, until there is an even
distribution of chunks for the collection across the shards. For details
about chunk migration, see :ref:`chunk-migration-procedure`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-archiveMovedChunks.rst

Chunk migrations carry some overhead in terms of bandwidth and
workload, both of which can impact database performance. The
:term:`balancer` attempts to minimize the impact by:

- Moving only one chunk at a time. See also
  :ref:`chunk-migration-queuing`.

- Starting a balancing round **only** when the difference in the
  number of chunks between the shard with the greatest number of chunks
  for a sharded collection and the shard with the lowest number of
  chunks for that collection reaches the :ref:`migration threshold
  <sharding-migration-thresholds>`.

You may disable the balancer temporarily for maintenance. See
:ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporally` for details.

You can also limit the window during which the balancer runs to prevent
it from impacting production traffic. See :ref:`Schedule the Balancing
Window <sharding-schedule-balancing-window>` for details.

.. note::

   The specification of the balancing window is relative to the local
   time zone of all individual :program:`mongos` instances in the
   cluster.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer`.

.. _sharding-migration-thresholds:

Migration Thresholds
--------------------

To minimize the impact of balancing on the cluster, the
:term:`balancer` will not begin balancing until the distribution of
chunks for a sharded collection has reached certain thresholds. The
thresholds apply to the difference in number of :term:`chunks <chunk>`
between the shard with the most chunks for the collection and the shard
with the fewest chunks for that collection. The balancer has the
following thresholds:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Number of Chunks
     - Migration Threshold

   * - Fewer than 20
     - 2

   * - 20-79
     - 4

   * - 80 and greater
     - 8

Once a balancing round starts, the balancer will not stop until, for
the collection, the difference between the number of chunks on any two
shards for that collection is *less than two* or a chunk migration
fails.

.. _sharding-shard-size:

Shard Size
----------

By default, MongoDB will attempt to fill all available disk space with
data on every shard as the data set grows. To ensure that the cluster
always has the capacity to handle data growth, monitor disk
usage as well as other performance metrics.

When adding a shard, you may set a "maximum size" for that shard.
This prevents the :term:`balancer` from migrating chunks to the shard
when the value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped` exceeds the
"maximum size". Use the ``maxSize`` parameter of the
:dbcommand:`addShard` command to set the "maximum size" for the shard.

.. seealso:: :ref:`sharded-cluster-config-max-shard-size` and
   :doc:`/administration/monitoring`.
