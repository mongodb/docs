   :description: Learn how to use PyMongo's UuidRepresentation option to handle UUIDs for cross-language compatibility in MongoDB applications.

Overview
--------

MongoDB drivers have historically differed in how they encode
**universally unique identifiers** (UUIDs). In this guide, you can learn how to use
{+driver-short+}'s ``UuidRepresentation`` configuration option to maintain cross-language
compatibility when working with UUIDs.

.. tip::

   In MongoDB applications, you can use the ``ObjectId`` type as a unique identifier for
   a document. Consider using ``ObjectId`` in place of a UUID where possible.

.. _example-legacy-uuid:

A Short History of MongoDB UUIDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider a UUID with the following canonical textual representation:

.. code-block::

  00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff

Originally, MongoDB represented UUIDs as BSON ``Binary``
values of subtype 3. Because subtype 3 didn't standardize the byte order of UUIDs
during encoding, different MongoDB drivers encoded UUIDs with different byte orders.
Use the following tabs to compare the ways in which different MongoDB language drivers
encoded the preceding UUID to ``Binary`` subtype 3:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+driver-short+}
      :tabid: pymongo
   
      .. code-block:: python

         00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff

   .. tab:: .NET/C# Driver
      :tabid: csharp

      .. code-block:: csharp

         33221100-5544-7766-8899-aabbccddeeff

   .. tab:: Java Driver
      :tabid: java

      .. code-block:: java

         77665544-3322-1100-ffee-ddccbbaa9988

To standardize UUID byte order, we created ``Binary`` subtype 4. Although this subtype
is handled consistently across MongoDB drivers, some MongoDB deployments still contain
UUID values of subtype 3.

.. important::
  
   Use caution when storing or retrieving UUIDs of subtype 3. 
   A UUID of this type stored by one MongoDB driver might have a different value when
   retrieved by a different driver.

.. _specify-uuid-representation:

Specify a UUID Representation
-----------------------------

To ensure that your {+driver-short+} application handles UUIDs correctly, use the
``UuidRepresentation`` option. This option 
determines how the driver encodes UUID objects to BSON and decodes ``Binary`` subtype
3 and 4 values from BSON.

You can set the UUID representation option in the following ways:

- Pass the ``uuidRepresentation`` parameter when constructing a ``MongoClient``.
  {+driver-short+} uses the specified UUID representation for all operations performed
  with this ``MongoClient`` instance.
- Include the ``uuidRepresentation`` parameter in the MongoDB connection string.
  {+driver-short+} uses the specified UUID representation for all operations performed
  with this ``MongoClient`` instance.
- Pass the ``codec_options`` parameter when calling the ``get_database()`` method.
  {+driver-short+} uses the specified UUID representation for all operations performed
  on the retrieved database.
- Pass the ``codec_options`` parameter when calling the ``get_collection()`` method.
  {+driver-short+} uses the specified UUID representation for all operations performed
  on the retrieved collection.

Select from the following tabs to see how to specify the preceding options. To learn
more about the available UUID representations, see :ref:`pymongo-uuid-options`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoClient
      :tabid: mongoclient

      The ``uuidRepresentation`` parameter accepts the values defined in the
      `UuidRepresentation <{+api-root+}bson/binary.html#bson.binary.UuidRepresentation>`__
      enum. The following code example specifies ``STANDARD`` for the UUID representation:
      
      .. code-block:: python

         from bson.binary import UuidRepresentation

         client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://<hostname>:<port>",
                                      uuidRepresentation=UuidRepresentation.STANDARD)

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: connectionstring

      The ``uuidRepresentation`` parameter accepts the following values:
      
      - ``unspecified``
      - ``standard``
      - ``pythonLegacy``
      - ``javaLegacy``
      - ``csharpLegacy``
      
      The following code example specifies ``standard`` for the UUID representation:
      
      .. code-block:: python

         uri = "mongodb://<hostname>:<port>/?uuidRepresentation=standard"
         client = MongoClient(uri)

   .. tab:: Database
      :tabid: database

      To specify the UUID format when calling the ``get_database()`` method,
      create an instance of the ``CodecOptions`` class and pass the ``uuid_representation``
      argument to the constructor. The following example shows how to obtain a database
      reference while using the ``CSHARP_LEGACY`` UUID format:

      .. code-block:: python

         from bson.codec_options import CodecOptions
         
         csharp_opts = CodecOptions(uuid_representation=UuidRepresentation.CSHARP_LEGACY)
         csharp_database = client.get_database("database_name", codec_options=csharp_opts)

      .. tip::

        You can also specify the ``codec_options`` argument when calling the
        ``database.with_options()`` method. For more information about this method,
        see :ref:`pymongo-config-read-write` in the Databases and Collections guide.

   .. tab:: Collection
      :tabid: collection

      To specify the UUID format when calling the ``get_collection()`` method,
      create an instance of the ``CodecOptions`` class and pass the ``uuid_representation``
      argument to the constructor. The following example shows how to obtain a collection
      reference while using the ``CSHARP_LEGACY`` UUID format:
      
      .. code-block:: python

         from bson.codec_options import CodecOptions
         
         csharp_opts = CodecOptions(uuid_representation=UuidRepresentation.CSHARP_LEGACY)
         csharp_collection = client.testdb.get_collection("collection_name", codec_options=csharp_opts)

      .. tip::

        You can also specify the ``codec_options`` argument when calling the
        ``collection.with_options()`` method. For more information about this method,
        see :ref:`pymongo-config-read-write` in the Databases and Collections guide.

     - ``Binary`` subtype 4
     - ``UUID``

The following sections describe the preceding UUID representation options in more detail.

.. _unspecified-representation-details:

``UNSPECIFIED``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   ``UNSPECIFIED`` is the default UUID representation in {+driver-short+}.

When using the ``UNSPECIFIED`` representation, {+driver-short+} decodes BSON
``Binary`` values to ``Binary`` objects of the same subtype.
To convert a ``Binary`` object into a native
``UUID`` object, call the ``Binary.as_uuid()`` method and specify a UUID representation
format.

If you try to encode a ``UUID`` object while using this representation, {+driver-short+}
raises a ``ValueError``. To avoid this, call the ``Binary.from_uuid()`` method on the UUID,
as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: python

  explicit_binary = Binary.from_uuid(uuid4(), UuidRepresentation.STANDARD)

The following code example shows how to retrieve a document containing a UUID with the
``UNSPECIFIED`` representation, then convert the value to a ``UUID`` object.
To do so, the code performs the following steps:

- Inserts a document that contains a ``uuid`` field using the ``CSHARP_LEGACY`` UUID
  representation.
- Retrieves the same document using the ``UNSPECIFIED`` representation. {+driver-short+}
  decodes the value of the ``uuid`` field as a ``Binary`` object.
- Calls the ``as_uuid()`` method to convert the value of the ``uuid`` field to a ``UUID``
  object of type ``CSHARP_LEGACY``. After it's converted, this value is identical to
  the original UUID inserted by {+driver-short+}. 

.. code-block:: python

   from bson.codec_options import CodecOptions, DEFAULT_CODEC_OPTIONS
   from bson.binary import Binary, UuidRepresentation
   from uuid import uuid4

   # Using UuidRepresentation.CSHARP_LEGACY
   csharp_opts = CodecOptions(uuid_representation=UuidRepresentation.CSHARP_LEGACY)

   # Store a legacy C#-formatted UUID
   input_uuid = uuid4()
   collection = client.testdb.get_collection('test', codec_options=csharp_opts)
   collection.insert_one({'_id': 'foo', 'uuid': input_uuid})

   # Using UuidRepresentation.UNSPECIFIED
   unspec_opts = CodecOptions(uuid_representation=UuidRepresentation.UNSPECIFIED)
   unspec_collection = client.testdb.get_collection('test', codec_options=unspec_opts)

   # UUID fields are decoded as Binary when UuidRepresentation.UNSPECIFIED is configured
   document = unspec_collection.find_one({'_id': 'foo'})
   decoded_field = document['uuid']
   assert isinstance(decoded_field, Binary)

   # Binary.as_uuid() can be used to convert the decoded value to a native UUID
   decoded_uuid = decoded_field.as_uuid(UuidRepresentation.CSHARP_LEGACY)
   assert decoded_uuid == input_uuid

.. _standard-representation-details:

``STANDARD``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the ``STANDARD`` UUID representation, {+driver-short+} encodes native ``UUID``
objects to ``Binary`` subtype 4 objects. All MongoDB drivers using the ``STANDARD``
representation treat these objects in the same way, with no changes to byte order.

Use the ``STANDARD`` UUID representation in all new applications, and in all
applications working with MongoDB UUIDs for the first time. 

.. _python-legacy-representation-details:

``PYTHON_LEGACY``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``PYTHON_LEGACY`` UUID representation
corresponds to the legacy representation of UUIDs used by versions of {+driver-short+}
earlier than v4.0.
When using the ``PYTHON_LEGACY`` UUID representation, {+driver-short+} encodes native
``UUID`` objects to ``Binary`` subtype 3 objects, preserving the same
byte order as the ``UUID.bytes`` property.

Use the ``PYTHON_LEGACY`` UUID representation if the
UUID you're reading from MongoDB was inserted using the ``PYTHON_LEGACY`` representation.
This will be true if both of the following criteria are met:

- The UUID was inserted by an application using a version of {+driver-short+} earlier
  than v4.0.
- The application that inserted the UUID didn't specify the ``STANDARD`` UUID
  representation.

.. _java-legacy-representation-details:

``JAVA_LEGACY``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``JAVA_LEGACY`` UUID representation
corresponds to the legacy representation of UUIDs used by the MongoDB Java
Driver. When using the ``JAVA_LEGACY`` UUID representation, {+driver-short+} encodes native
``UUID`` objects to ``Binary`` subtype 3 objects with Java legacy byte order.

Use the ``JAVA_LEGACY`` UUID representation if the
UUID you're reading from MongoDB was inserted using the ``JAVA_LEGACY`` representation.
This will be true if both of the following criteria are met:

- The UUID was inserted by an application using the MongoDB Java Driver.
- The application didn't specify the ``STANDARD`` UUID representation.

.. _csharp-legacy-representation-details:

``CSHARP_LEGACY``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``CSHARP_LEGACY`` UUID representation
corresponds to the legacy representation of UUIDs used by the MongoDB .NET/C#
Driver. When using the ``CSHARP_LEGACY`` UUID representation, {+driver-short+} encodes
native ``UUID`` objects to ``Binary`` subtype 3 objects with C# legacy byte order.

Use the ``CSHARP_LEGACY`` UUID representation if the
UUID you're reading from MongoDB was inserted using the ``CSHARP_LEGACY`` representation.
This will be true if both of the following criteria are met:

- The UUID was inserted by an application using the MongoDB .NET/C# Driver.
- The application didn't specify the ``STANDARD`` UUID representation.
