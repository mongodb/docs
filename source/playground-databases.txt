You can create 
:manual:`databases and collections </core/databases-and-collections/>` 
using a MongoDB Playground. 

Prerequisites
-------------

If you have not done so already, you must complete the following 
prerequisites before you can create a database or collection with a 
MongoDB Playground:

- :ref:`Create a connection to a MongoDB deployment 
  <vsce-connect-task>`.
- :ref:`Activate the connection to the MongoDB deployment 
  <vsce-activate-connection>`.

Create a Database and Collection
--------------------------------

Once you connect to your deployment using MongoDB for VS code, use the left 
navigation to: 

1. Select an active connection and click the :icon-fa5:`plus` icon that 
   appears.
   
#. A MongoDB playground automatically opens with a template form to create 
   a database and a regular collection or a 
   :ref:`time series collection <vsce-time-series>`. 

#. Fill in ``const database`` and ``const collection`` with names of your 
   database and collection.

#. Uncomment the form of the collection you wish to create.

#. Fill in the collection fields according to your collection's specifications.

#. To run the playground, click the :guilabel:`Play Button` at the top right
   of the VS code navigation bar.

After running the playground, the left navigation updates with new database 
listed under the active connection it was created. You can find the newly 
created collection by expanding the new database.

   - To add documents to the collection, see 
     :ref:`vsce-create-doc-playground`.  

   - To learn more about creating time series collections using MongoDB 
     playgrounds, see :ref:`vsce-time-series`

Example
-------

This example creates a database named ``grades`` and a regular collection 
named ``testscores``.

To use this example, start with a template from your MongoDB 
Playgrounds: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   const database = 'grades';
   const collection = 'testscores';

   use(database);

   db.createCollection(collection);

In the example:

- ``const database`` declares the name ``grades`` for the database.
  
- ``const collection`` declares the name ``testscores`` for the collection. 

- ``use(database)`` creates the new ``grades`` database.

- ``db.createCollection(collection)`` creates the collection ``testscores``
  inside of the ``grades`` database.

When you press the :guilabel:`Play Button`, MongoDB for VS Code shows the 
following results in the ``Playground Results.json``  pane to confirm the 
creation of the database and collection.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "ok": 1
   }

The ``grades`` database and ``testscores`` collection also appear in your 
left navigation:
