MMS Automation provides an interface for provisioning machines,
configuring MongoDB nodes and clusters, and upgrading your MongoDB
deployment. You can deploy automation in two modes: using provisioning
where MMS integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to
deploy EC2 instances and deploy Automation Agents automatically; or
using existing hardware where you deploy Automation Agent on your
existing systems.
