   |service| provides |fts| metrics for {+database-deployments+} with 
   at least one active |fts| index. To set up an |fts| index, see
   :ref:`fts-top-ref`.

To view |fts| metrics for a {+database-deployment+}:

#. Click the :guilabel:`View Monitoring` button for that
   {+database-deployment+}.

#. Select one or more of the search charts.

Alternatively:

#. Click on the name of the {+database-deployment+} to open the 
   {+database-deployment+} overview.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Metrics` tab.
 
#. Select one or more of the search charts.

To view |fts| metrics for a specific process:

#. Click the link for the process.
 
#. Click the :guilabel:`Search Metrics` tab.

   * - Chart
        
     - Data

   * - :guilabel:`Search Disk Space Used`
   
     - Total bytes of disk space that search indexes occupy.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Fields Indexed`

     -  Total number of unique fields present in the |fts| 
        index.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Index Size`

     - Total size of all indexes on disk in bytes.

   * - :guilabel:`Search JVM Heap Memory`

     - Amount of memory that the JVM heap is currently 
       using.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Max Number of Lucene Docs`

     - Upper bound on the number of Lucene docs used to store |fts| 
       indexes in this replica set or shard.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Max Replication Lag`
    
     - Approximate number of milliseconds that |fts| is behind in 
       replicating changes from the :term:`oplog` of |mongod|.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Normalized Process CPU`
   
     - CPU usage of search processes on the node scaled to a 
       range of 0-100% by dividing by the number of CPU cores.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Opcounters`

     - Total number of |fts| operations.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Process CPU`
   
     - Percentage of time that the CPU spent servicing 
       search processes. For servers with more than 1 CPU core, this value can exceed 100%.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Process Memory` 
   
     - Total bytes of memory that search processes occupy.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Query Status`

     - Total number of |fts| queries with each status.
