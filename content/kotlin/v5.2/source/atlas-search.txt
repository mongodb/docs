Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to
run :atlas:`{+search+} </atlas-search/>` queries on a collection.
{+search+} enables you to perform full-text searches on collections
hosted on MongoDB. {+search+} indexes specify the behavior of the
search and which fields to index.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to
create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
`Get Started <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/get-started/>`__ guide. To learn more about
aggregation operations and builders, see the :ref:`kotlin-aggregation` guide. 

Run a {+search+} Query
-----------------------------

This section shows how to create an aggregation pipeline to run a
{+search+} query on a collection. You can use the ``Aggregates.search()`` builder
method to create a ``$search`` pipeline stage, which specifies the search
criteria. Then, call the ``aggregate()`` method and pass your pipeline as a
parameter.

.. note:: Only Available on Atlas for MongoDB v4.2 and later

   This aggregation pipeline operator is only available for collections hosted
   on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` clusters running v4.2 or later that are
   covered by a :atlas:`{+search+} index </reference/atlas-search/index-definitions/>`.
   Learn more about the required setup and the functionality of this operator
   from the :atlas:`{+search+} </atlas-search/>` documentation.

Before running a {+search+} query, you must create a {+search+} index
on your collection. To learn how to programmatically create a {+search+}
index, see the :ref:`kotlin-search-indexes` section in the Indexes guide. 

{+search+} Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can run this example, you must create a {+search+} index on the movies
collection that has the following definition:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "mappings": {
       "dynamic": false,
       "fields": {
         "title": {
           "type": "string"
         }
       }
     }
   }

This example runs a {+search+} query by performing the
following actions:

- Constructs a ``$search`` stage by using the ``Aggregates.search()`` builder method,
  instructing the driver to query for documents in which the ``title``
  field contains the word ``"Alabama"``

- Constructs a ``$project`` stage by using the ``Aggregates.project()`` builder method,
  instructing the driver to include the ``title`` field in the query results

- Passes the pipeline stages to the ``aggregate()`` method and prints the results

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /examples/atlas-examples/AtlasSearch.kt
      :start-after: begin-atlas-search
      :end-before: end-atlas-search
      :language: kotlin
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      {"_id": {"$oid": "..."}, "title": "Alabama Moon"}
      {"_id": {"$oid": "..."}, "title": "Crazy in Alabama"}
      {"_id": {"$oid": "..."}, "title": "Sweet Home Alabama"}

{+search+} Metadata
-----------------------

Use the ``searchMeta()`` method to create a :manual:`$searchMeta
</reference/operator/aggregation/searchMeta/>` pipeline stage, which returns
only the metadata from the Atlas full-text search results. 

.. tip:: Only Available on Atlas for MongoDB v4.4.11 and later

   This aggregation pipeline operator is available only
   on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` clusters running v4.4.11 and later.

Before you can run this example, you must create a {+search+} index on the movies
collection that has the following definition:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "mappings": {
       "dynamic": false,
       "fields": {
         "year": {
           "type": "number"
         }
       }
     }
   }

The following example shows the ``near`` metadata for a {+search+}
aggregation stage:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/atlas-examples/SearchMetaAgg.kt
   :start-after: // begin atlasSearchMeta
   :end-before: // end atlasSearchMeta
   :language: kotlin
   :dedent:
