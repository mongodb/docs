This tutorial uses :ref:`zone-sharding` to segment data based on
geographic area.

The following are some example use cases for segmenting data by geographic
area:

* An application that requires segmenting user data based on geographic country
* A database that requires resource allocation based on geographic country

The following diagram illustrates a sharded cluster that uses geographic based
zones to manage and satisfy data segmentation requirements.

Scenario
--------

A financial chat application logs messages, tracking the country of the
originating user. The application stores the logs in the ``chat`` database
under the ``messages`` collection. The chats contain information that must be
segmented by country to have servers local to the country serve read and write
requests for the country's users. A group of countries can be assigned
same zone in order to share resources.

The application currently has users in the US, UK, and Germany. The
``country`` field represents the user's country based on its
`ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2>`_
two-character country codes.

The following documents represent a partial view of three chat messages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fa"),
     "country" : "US",
     "userid" : 123,
     "message" : "Hello there",
     ...,
   }
   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fb"),
     "country" : "UK",
     "userid" : 456,
     "message" : "Good Morning"
     ...,
   }
   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fc"),
     "country" : "DE",
     "userid" : 789,
     "message" : "Guten Tag"
     ...,
   }


Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~

The ``messages`` collection uses the ``{ country : 1, userid : 1 }`` compound
index as the shard key.

The ``country`` field in each document allows for creating a zone for
each distinct country value.

The ``userid`` field provides a high :ref:`cardinality <shard-key-cardinality>`
and low :ref:`frequency <shard-key-frequency>` component to the shard key
relative to ``country``.

See :ref:`Choosing a Shard Key <sharding-shard-key-requirements>` for more
general instructions on selecting a shard key.

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sharded cluster has shards in two data centers - one in Europe, and
one in North America.

.. include:: /images/sharding-segmenting-data-by-location-architecture.rst


Zones
~~~~~

This application requires one zone per data center.

``EU`` - European data center
   Shards deployed on this data center are assigned to the ``EU`` zone.

   For each country using the ``EU`` data center for local reads and writes,
   create a zone range for the ``EU`` zone with:

   * a lower bound of ``{ "country" : <country>, "userid" : MinKey }``
   * an upper bound of ``{ "country" : <country>, "userid" : MaxKey }``

``NA`` - North American data center
   Shards deployed on this data center are assigned to the ``NA`` zone.

   For each country using the ``NA`` data center for local reads and writes,
   create a zone range for the ``NA`` zone with:

   * a lower bound of ``{ "country" : <country>, "userid" : MinKey }``
   * an upper bound of ``{ "country" : <country>, "userid" : MaxKey }``

.. note::

   The :bsontype:`MinKey` and :bsontype:`MaxKey` values are reserved special
   values for comparisons

Write Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With zones, if an inserted or updated document matches a
configured zone, it can only be written to a shard inside of that zone.

MongoDB can write documents that do not match a configured zone to any
shard in the cluster.

.. note::

   The behavior described above requires the cluster to be in a steady state
   with no chunks violating a configured zone. See the following section on
   the :ref:`balancer <sharding-segmenting-data-by-location-balancer>` for
   more information.

Read Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB can route queries to a specific shard if the query includes at least
the ``country`` field.

For example, MongoDB can attempt a :ref:`targeted read operation
<sharding-mongos-targeted>` on the following query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   chatDB = db.getSiblingDB("chat")
   chatDB.messages.find( { "country" : "UK" , "userid" : "123" } )

Queries without the ``country`` field perform :ref:`broadcast operations
<sharding-mongos-broadcast>`.

.. _sharding-segmenting-data-by-location-balancer:

Balancer
~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` :ref:`migrates
<sharding-chunk-migration>` chunks to the appropriate shard respecting any
configured zones. Until the migration, shards may contain chunks that violate
configured zones. Once balancing completes, shards should only
contain chunks whose ranges do not violate its assigned zones.

Adding or removing zones or zone ranges can result in chunk migrations.
Depending on the size of your data set and the number of chunks a zone or zone
range affects, these migrations may impact cluster performance. Consider
running your :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` during specific scheduled
windows. See :ref:`sharding-schedule-balancing-window` for a tutorial on how
to set a scheduling window.

Security
~~~~~~~~

For sharded clusters running with :ref:`authorization`, authenticate as a user
with at least the :authrole:`clusterManager` role on the ``admin`` database.

Procedure
---------

You must be connected to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` to create zones and zone ranges.
You cannot create zones or zone ranges by connecting directly to a
:term:`shard`.

Updating Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application requires the following updates:

* Documents with ``country : UK`` must now be associated to the new ``UK``
  data center. Any data in the ``EU`` data center must be migrated

* The chat application now supports users in Mexico. Documents with
  ``country : MX`` must be routed to the ``NA`` data center.

Perform the following procedures to update the zone ranges.
