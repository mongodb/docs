.. operator:: $orderby

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/mongo-shell-deprecated-meta-operator-orderby.rst

   The :operator:`$orderby` operator sorts the results of a query in
   ascending or descending order.

   The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the :method:`cursor.sort()`
   method:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find().sort( { age: -1 } )

   You can also specify the option in either of the following forms:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find()._addSpecial( "$orderby", { age : -1 } )
      db.collection.find( { $query: {}, $orderby: { age : -1 } } )

   These examples return all documents in the collection named
   ``collection`` sorted by the ``age`` field in descending order.
   Specify a value to :operator:`$orderby` of negative one (e.g.
   ``-1``, as above) to sort in descending order or a positive value
   (e.g. ``1``) to sort in ascending order.

Behavior
--------

Since indexes contain ordered records, MongoDB can obtain the results of
a sort from an index which includes the sort fields. MongoDB *may*
use multiple indexes to support a sort operation *if* the sort uses the
same indexes as the query predicate.

If MongoDB cannot use an index or indexes to obtain the sort
order, MongoDB must perform a blocking sort operation on the data.
A blocking sort indicates that MongoDB must consume and process all 
input documents to the sort before returning results. Blocking sorts do
not block concurrent operations on the collection or database.

Sort operations that use an index often have better performance than
blocking sorts. For more information on creating indexes to support
sort operations, see :ref:`sorting-with-indexes`.

If MongoDB requires using more than 100 megabytes of system memory for
the blocking sort operation, MongoDB returns an error *unless* the query
specifies :method:`cursor.allowDiskUse()` (*New in MongoDB 4.4*).
:method:`~cursor.allowDiskUse()` allows MongoDB to use temporary files
on disk to store data exceeding the 100 megabyte system memory limit
while processing a blocking sort operation.

To avoid this error, create an index to support the sort operation or
use :operator:`$orderby` in conjunction with
:method:`cursor.maxTimeMS()` and/or :method:`cursor.limit()`. The
:method:`cursor.limit()` increases the speed and reduces the amount of
memory required to return this query by way of an optimized algorithm.
The specified limit must result in a number of documents that fall
within the 100 megabyte limit.
