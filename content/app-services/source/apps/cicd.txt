Overview
--------

Many developers use :wikipedia:`continuous integration, delivery, and deployment
pipelines <CI/CD>` to automatically test and publish their applications whenever
they make changes. This is most common and useful for larger apps where multiple
people work on the codebase in parallel using a shared version control system
like git.

This guide covers the high level stages common to most CI/CD pipelines and
describes what you might do in each stage. Further, it includes a list of common
tasks and actions you might perform within your pipelines to configure and test
your Atlas App Services Apps.

.. tip:: See a real example with GitHub Actions
   
   If you'd like to see an example CI/CD pipeline that manages testing,
   deployment, and other tasks for a real application, check out the article
   `How to Build CI/CD Pipelines for App Services Apps Using GitHub Actions
   <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/how-to/build-ci-cd-pipelines-realm-apps-github-actions/>`__
   on the MongoDB Developer Hub.

Pipeline Stages
---------------

At a high level most pipelines share a common pattern of moving through multiple
stages that each handle different concerns.

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Development stage is the first step for creating new features and fixing
bugs in an App. In this stage you work with your application's
configuration files and source code to implement your desired changes. 

To develop new features for an existing app:

1. Fork the main app and :ref:`deploy a new development copy
   <sdlc-create-app>`. This instance will have a different App ID than your
   production app. You can also use :ref:`environment value templates
   <config-expansions>` to use development data sources and other services that
   are not linked to production.

2. Develop your application. This could involve updating or adding a client app
   screen, adding a new database trigger, or any other application features. You
   can use :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` if you need to
   make changes to your synced Realm Object Schema.

1. Run automated tests locally to ensure that your code does not introduce any
   new errors. Tests that pass locally do not guarantee that your app is free of
   integration bugs, but increase confidence that your changes do not include any
   regressions or unintended behavior.

Staging
~~~~~~~

The Staging stage, which you might also call QA (Quality Assurance), Testing, or
Pre-Production, is a step that simulates your development changes in an
environment that is as similar to production as possible. This gives you a
usable version of your app for review and can help you catch integration bugs
with live services without affecting production data.

The specifics of your staging deployment depend on your application's needs.
However, you can use the following high level procedure to set it up:

1. **Set up your staging environment.** Use separate, non-production services and
   data sources with configurations that mirror production as closely as
   possible. For example, you might use an Atlas cluster named ``staging`` that
   otherwise has the same configuration as your ``production`` cluster.
   Depending on your use case, you may have a consistent App that you
   reuse for all staging builds or you may create a new App for each
   staging build.

2. **Create or use an existing staging build.** You can automatically create a
   staging build as part of your CI/CD process, such as when you create a new
   new pull request. You can :ref:`use a new app <sdlc-create-app>` for each
   staging build or you can :ref:`reuse a prebuilt environment
   <sdlc-update-app>` that you share across builds.

3. **Verify that your app behaves as expected.** This might involve running an
   automated test suite against your staging environment, manually checking
   behavior, or getting approval through a user-acceptance test.

Production
~~~~~~~~~~

The Production stage is the final deployment step where your modified app is
deployed into your production environment. Ideally at this stage you have
already tested your changes locally and in staging to confirm that they are safe
to deploy. You can either deploy to production manually or automatically as part
of your CI/CD workflow by :ref:`updating your production app <sdlc-update-app>`.

Build Tasks
-----------

This section outlines common tasks that you will perform in your CI/CD pipeline.
You may not always do all of these tasks depending on your use case and pipeline
stage, but in general most pipelines will perform all of these at least once.

Configure the Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration and code for your app should generally be similar between
development stages. However, you'll want to change the value of certain
configuration options depending on the environment.

Determine what stage you're building and set the appropriate configuration
values. For example, you might configure the app with the App ID of a new app in
the Development stage or use your production App ID in the Production stage.

.. code-block:: bash
   
   # Use the production App ID for the main branch
   export REALM_APP_ID="myapp-abcde"
   # Use a staging App ID for the QA branch
   export REALM_APP_ID="myapp-staging-fghij"
   # Use a new App ID for development branches - you'll need to create the app first!
   export REALM_APP_ID="myapp-dev-zyxwv"

.. tip:: Find Your App ID
   
   You might not always be able to hardcode your App ID. You can look up a
   specific App ID with {+cli+}. For an example, see :ref:`Create an App
   <sdlc-create-app>`.

Set Up {+cli+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+cli+} is the easiest way to programmatically
create, configure, and manage Atlas Apps. You should install and
use the latest version in your deployment scripts.

.. include:: /includes/install-appservices-cli.rst

You'll also need a MongoDB Atlas public/private API key pair to authenticate and
use the CLI. For more information and a walkthrough of how to get an API key,
see :atlas:`Programmatic API Keys
</configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>`.

To log in, save your API keys in a new named profile configuration and then log
in with that profile:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: ~/.config/{+cli-bin+}/<Profile Name>.yaml
   
   <Profile Name>:
     public_api_key: "<MongoDB Atlas Public API Key>"
     private_api_key: "<MongoDB Atlas Private API Key>"
     atlas_base_url: "https://cloud.mongodb.com"
     realm_base_url: "https://services.cloud.mongodb.com"
     telemetry_mode: ""

.. code-block:: bash
   
   {+cli-bin+} login --profile="<Profile Name>"

.. tip::
   
   Make sure to use the ``--profile`` flag in all of your commands, otherwise
   {+cli+} won't recognize that you're logged in.

.. _sdlc-create-app:

Create an App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use {+cli+} to create new apps to use in development and testing. If
your pipeline is in the Development or Staging phase, you should deploy and test
changes with an app other than your live production app.

To use a new app for your development or staging branch:

1. **Create a New App**
   
   Push a new app based on your branch of the app's :ref:`configuration
   files<app-configuration>`:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
      
      cd path/to/realmApp
      {+cli-bin+} push -y --project="<MongoDB Atlas Project ID>" # e.g. --project="609ea544934fe445460219a2"

2. **Save the App ID**
   
   The new app has a unique App ID value that you'll need to identify it later
   in your pipeline and in your client app. You should save the value to an
   environment variable, file, or other location.
   
   .. code-block:: bash
      
      # Save to an environment variable
      output=$({+cli-bin+} app describe)
      app_id=$(echo $output | sed 's/^.*client_app_id": "\([^"]*\).*/\1/')
      export REALM_APP_ID=app_id
      # Save to a file
      echo $REALM_APP_ID > ./clients/ios/realm-app-id.txt

.. _sdlc-update-app:

Update an App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use {+cli+} to update an existing app, like a shared staging app or
your production deployment. The app already exists, so you should be able to
look up its App ID.

To update an existing app, specify its App ID in the ``--remote`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   {+cli-bin+} push --remote=$REALM_APP_ID -y

Run Tests Against the App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your app should include automated unit and integration test suites that you can
run to verify that everything works. The specifics of your test setup will vary
depending upon your app, but you may need to run tests across multiple platforms
using a variety of simulators.

If you have integration tests, you could checkout previous releases and run your
integration tests against the current version of the App to ensure
backwards compatibility.

Clean Up the Job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the end of a CI/CD stage or pipeline you may want to clean up resources that
you created specifically for that test. For example, if you create a new
Development or Staging app, you might delete the apps and any databases
associated with them once your changes are merged. Alternatively, you would not
want to clean up your production app or a persistent staging app if you use one.

Before you clean up, consider what resources may be useful in future. For
example, you could choose to skip deleting apps and their databases if your
tests fail. That way you can manually investigate the issue and find any app
settings or data that caused the failure.
