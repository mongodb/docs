When you restore a replica set from backup, |mms| provides you with a
restore file for the selected restore point. To learn about the
restore process, please see :doc:`/tutorial/nav/restore-overview`.

Backup Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All |fcv| databases must fulfill the appropriate
:ref:`backup considerations <4.2-backup-considerations>`.

Automatic Restore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To have |mms| automatically restore the snapshot:

.. include:: /includes/steps/restore-automatic-replica-set-wt.rst

Manual Restore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Consider Automatic Restore

   This procedure involves a large number steps. Some of these steps
   have severe security implications. If you don't need to restore to a
   deployment that |mms| doesn't manage, consider an automated restore.
