sh.shardCollection()
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: sh.shardCollection(collection,key,unique)

   :param string collection: The namespace of the collection to shard.

   :param document key: A :term:`document` containing a :term:`shard key`
                        that the sharding system uses to
                        :term:`partition` and distribute objects among
                        the shards.

   :param boolean unique: When true, the ``unique`` option ensures
                          that the underlying index enforces
                          uniqueness so long as the unique index is a
                          prefix of the shard key.

                          You cannot create a unique constraint when
                          using a :term:`hashed shard key`.

   Shards the named collection, according to the specified
   :term:`shard key`. Specify shard keys in the form of a :term:`document`.
   Shard keys may refer to a single document field, or more typically
   several document fields to form a "compound shard key."

   .. versionadded:: 2.4
      Use the form ``{field: "hashed"}`` to create a
      :term:`hashed shard key <hashed shard key>`.
      Only one field may be used with a hashed shard key.
