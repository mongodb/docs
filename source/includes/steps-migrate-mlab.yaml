title: Create an Atlas deployment
ref: atlas-deployment
level: 4
stepnum: 1
content: |
  If you don't already have an Atlas deployment, `create one
  <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/create-new-cluster/>`_ now. You'll need
  a `cluster tier
  <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/create-new-cluster/#c-select-the-cluster-tier>`_
  of ``M10`` or larger to perform Live Migration.

title: Check your mLab Network Access Mode
ref: mlab-networking
level: 4
stepnum: 2
content: |
  Log in to your `mLab account <https://mlab.com/login/>`_
  and navigate to your cluster console.
  Select the :guilabel:`Networking` tab.
  Your mLab deployment may be in one of three Network Access Modes:
  :guilabel:`Public`, :guilabel:`Private (Dual Access)` or
  :guilabel:`Private`. If your deployment is :guilabel:`Private`,
  no external access is allowed, so you will need to switch to one of
  the other two modes before proceeding with migration.

     :figwidth: 700px  

  .. note::

     It will be helpful during the migration process to keep one
     browser window open on your mLab cluster console and one
     window open on your `Atlas console <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`_.

title: Create an oplog user on your admin database
ref: create-oplog-reader
level: 4
stepnum: 3
content: |
  To perform the migration process, you need a database user with
  permission to read the oplog on your ``admin`` database.

  To create an oplog user:

  a. Select :guilabel:`Databases`
  #. Under :guilabel:`System Databases`, select the :guilabel:`admin` database
  #. Select the :guilabel:`Users` tab
  #. Click the :guilabel:`Add oplog user` button and name the user
     :guilabel:`oplog-reader`

  .. figure:: /images/add-oplog-user.png

title: Begin the Atlas Live Migration process
ref: begin-live-migration
level: 4
stepnum: 4
content: |
  Navigate to your Atlas cluster. Click the ellipsis (:guilabel:`...`)
  button and select :guilabel:`Migrate Data to this Cluster`.

title: Review migration steps
ref: review-steps
level: 4
stepnum: 5
content: |
  Read through the overview of migration steps in the Live Migration
  dialog window, then click the green :guilabel:`I'm ready to migrate`
  button.

title: Add allowable IP address ranges to your mLab deployment
ref: add-ip-ranges
level: 4
stepnum: 6
content: |
  For this step you'll need to have browser tabs open
  with both the Atlas Live Migration dialog (from step 4)
  and your mLab cluster console.

  From your mLab cluster console:

  a. Select the :guilabel:`Networking` tab
  #. Click the :guilabel:`Add IP address range rule(s)` button
  #. Add all four of the IP address granges listed in the Atlas
     Migration Service dialog from step 5
  #. Optional: Add a :guilabel:`Description` for your IP range
  #. Click the blue :guilabel:`Add` button when you're finished	  

  .. figure:: /images/add-ip-ranges.png
     :figwidth: 521px

  You should now see all the Atlas IP ranges listed in the
  :guilabel:`Inbound allow rules` section. Click the
  :guilabel:`Apply security changes` button to finish the operation.

  .. note::

     Your IP address ranges may be different from those shown here.
---
title: Add the hostname and port of your mLab cluster primary to the
       Atlas Live Migration dialog
ref: add-hostname-port
level: 4
stepnum: 7
content: |
  Find the hostname and port number of your mLab cluster primary
  node in your mLab cluster console and add it to the Atlas Live
  Migration dialog.

  .. important::

     If your mLab cluster is running in the
     :guilabel:`Private (Dual Access)` networking mode, you will need to
     use the public hostname of the primary. If you provide the
     public hostname of a secondary, Live Migration will not be able to
     automatically detect the primary and the migration will fail.

     To get the primary's public hostname, append ``-external`` to the
     string to the left of the first period in the primary's hostname.

     For example, the public hostname for ``ds012345-a0.mlab.com:12345``
     is ``ds012345-a0-external.mlab.com:12345``.

title: Enter the oplog user's credentials in the Live Migration dialog
ref: 
level: 4
stepnum: 8
content: |
  Enter the username and password for :guilabel:`oplog-reader` in the
  Atlas Live Migration dialog window.
---
title: Specify if Live Migration should use SSL to connect to your mLab
  cluster
ref: enter-cafile
level: 4
stepnum: 9
content: |
  Dedicated mLab clusters deploy with the :setting:`net.ssl.mode` set
  to ``preferSSL`` by default. This allows the cluster to accept both
  TLS/SSL and non-TLS/non-SSL connections.

  If you wish to connect to your mLab cluster using TLS/SSL, toggle
  :guilabel:`Is SSL enabled?` to :guilabel:`Yes`. 

  .. note::

     You do not need to fill in the :guilabel:`Upload CA File` section
     that appears on the form after SSL is enabled when migrating from
     an mLab cluster.

---
title: Validate your Live Migration form
ref: validate-form
level: 4
stepnum: 10
content: |
  Your Atlas Live Migration form should now look like this:

  .. figure:: /images/live-migration-full.png
     :figwidth: 655px

  Click the :guilabel:`Validate` button to check that all your form
  fields are valid and everything is ready to go. When your form
  is validated, click the :guilabel:`Start Migration` button.
---
title: Start migration
ref: start-migration
level: 4
stepnum: 11
content: |
  When the migration process begins, the Live Migration dialog window
  closes and you are returned to the Atlas cluster overview page. A
  progress bar shows the progess of your migration.

  Once the migration is complete, you can begin to update your
  client applications to use the new Atlas connection string.

title: Start your cutover
ref: start-cutover
level: 4
stepnum: 12
content: |
  Your mLab cluster and your Atlas cluster are now in sync. Atlas will
  maintain this synchronized state for 72 hours. If you need more time,
  syncing can be extended for another 24 hours.

  Click the green :guilabel:`Start cutover` button and follow the
  instructions listed in the dialog window.
