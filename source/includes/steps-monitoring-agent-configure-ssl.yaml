title: "Configure the agent with the trusted CA certificate that signed the MongoDB instance's certificate."
stepnum: 1
ref: certificate
content: |
  In the agent's install directory, edit the ``monitoring-agent.config``
  file and set the ``sslTrustedServerCertificates`` field to the path of a
  file containing one or more certificates in PEM format.

  By default, the agent connects to MongoDB instances using a trusted
  certificate. For testing purposes, you can set the
  ``sslRequireValidServerCertificates`` setting to ``False`` to bypass
  this check. This configuration is **not** recommended for production use as
  it makes the connection insecure.

  For reference information on both settings, see :ref:`ssl-settings-monitoring`.

  :guilabel:`Deployment`. On the line listing the host, click the gear
  icon and select :guilabel:`Edit Host`. Select the :guilabel:`SSL` tab,

  **Optionally**, you can enable SSL support globally through the agent's
  ``useSslForAllConnections`` configuration option. See
  :ref:`monitoring-agent-ssl-settings`.
