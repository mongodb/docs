pre: |
  On each server, edit the ``conf-mms.properties`` file to
  set the :setting:`mongo.mongoUri` property to the :manual:`connection string
  </reference/connection-string/>` of the :ref:`mms-application-database`. You
  *must* specify at least **3** hosts in the :setting:`mongo.mongoUri`
  connection string. For example:
action:
  language: ini
  code: |
    mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://<mms0.example.net>:<27017>,<mms1.example.net>:<27017>,<mms2.example.net>:<27017>/?maxPoolSize=100

  For example, if you installed the |application| with an
  ``rpm`` or ``deb`` package, issue the following:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    service mongodb-mms start

  The ``gen.key`` file is located in ``/etc/mongodb-mms/`` for
  installations from a package manager and in ``${HOME}/.mongodb-mms/``
  for installations from an archive.

  Copy the ``gen.key`` file from the running |application|'s server to the
  appropriate directory on the other |application| servers.
