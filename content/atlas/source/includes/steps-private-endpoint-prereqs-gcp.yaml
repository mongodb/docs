  Complete the prerequisites and :gcp:`create one endpoint per service attachment </vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-services#create-endpoint>`
  in |gcp| with the following information:

  - The |gcp| network and subnet that you want to use to connect to |service|.

  - The service attachment URIs of the private endpoint service that you created with 
    :oas-atlas-op:`/groups/{GROUP-ID}/privateEndpoint/endpointService
    </createOnePrivateEndpointServiceForOneProvider>`.

    You can retrieve these fields once |service| finishes creating them 
    with :oas-atlas-op:`/groups/{GROUP-ID}/privateEndpoint/{CLOUD-PROVIDER}/endpointService/{ENDPOINT-SERVICE-ID}
    </returnOnePrivateEndpointServiceForOneProvider>`.

    For more information, see :doc:`Set up a Private Endpoint </security-private-endpoint>`.
