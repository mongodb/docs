  character: "`"

  Use the :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` method create a unique
  index.

   The method returns a document with the status of the results. The
   method only creates an index if the index does not already exist. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/create-an-index` and
   :doc:`/administration/indexes-creation` for more information on
   creating indexes.

  text: Attempt to modify the index.
  character: "`"
stepnum: 2
pre: |
   To modify an existing index, you **cannot** just re-issue the
   :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` method with the updated
   specification of the index.
 
   For example, the following operation attempts to remove the
   ``unique`` constraint from the previously created index by using the
   :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` method.
ref: ""
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
     db.orders.ensureIndex( 
        { "cust_id" : 1, "ord_date" : -1, "items" : 1 }
     )
post: |
   The status document returned by the operation shows an error.

title:
  text: Drop the index.
  character: "`"
stepnum: 3
pre: |
   To modify the index, you must drop the index first.
ref: ""
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
     db.orders.dropIndex( 
        { "cust_id" : 1, "ord_date" : -1, "items" : 1 }
     )
post: |
   The method returns a document with the status of the operation. Upon
   successful operation, the ``ok`` field in the returned document should
   specify a ``1``. See :doc:`/tutorial/remove-indexes` for more
   information about dropping indexes.

post: |
   The method returns a document with the status of the results. Upon
   successful operation, the returned document should show the
   ``numIndexesAfter`` to be greater than ``numIndexesBefore`` by one.
