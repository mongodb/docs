Staring in :binary:`mongosh` version 1.0.5, |mdb-shell| stores logs for
each session in the same format as the MongoDB server. Earlier versions
of :binary:`mongosh` used `ndjson <http://ndjson.org/>`__ format. For
details on the current log formats, see :ref:`log-messages-ref`.  

You can view or tail the logs for a |mdb-shell| session based on its
log ID.
