MongoDB Playgrounds are JavaScript environments where you can prototype
queries, aggregations, and MongoDB commands with helpful syntax
highlighting.

MongoDB Playgrounds provide intelligent autocomplete for:

- The Mongo Shell |api|,
- MongoDB operators,
- Database, collection, and field names.

You can save playgrounds in your workspace and use them to
document how your application interacts with MongoDB.
