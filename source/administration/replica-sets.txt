The administration of :term:`replica sets <replica set>` includes the
initial deployment of the set, adding and removing members to a set,
and configuring the operational parameters and properties of the
set. Administrators generally need not intervene in failover or
replication processes as MongoDB automates these functions. In the
exceptional situations that require manual interventions, the
tutorials in these sections describe processes such as resyncing a
member. The tutorials in this section form the basis for all replica
set administration.
