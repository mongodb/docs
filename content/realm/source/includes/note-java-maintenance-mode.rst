.. note:: Java SDK in Maintenance Mode

   The Java SDK is in best-effort maintenance mode and **no longer receives 
   new development or non-critical bug fixes**. To develop your app with new 
   features, use the :ref:`Kotlin SDK <kotlin-intro>`. You can use the Java SDK 
   with the Kotlin SDK in the same project.
