|service| provides a hierarchy based on organizations and projects to
facilitate the management of your |service| clusters. Groups are now
known as Projects. You can put multiple Projects under an Organization.

.. _organizations:

Organizations
-------------

In the organizations and projects hierarchy, an organization can
contain multiple projects (previously referred to as groups). Under
this structure:

.. include:: /includes/list-organization-hierarchy.rst

Previously, users managed deployments by groups, where each group was
managed separately even if a user belonged multiple groups.

.. _projects:

Groups are now projects in the organizations and projects hierarchy.
With the organizations projects hierarchy, you can create multiple
projects in an organization.

.. include:: /includes/list-projects-hierarchy.rst
