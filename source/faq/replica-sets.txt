What kinds of replication does MongoDB support?
-----------------------------------------------

MongoDB supports master-slave replication and a variation
on master-slave replication known as replica sets. Replica
sets are the recommended replication topology.

What do the terms "primary" and "master" mean?
----------------------------------------------

:term:`Primary` and :term:`master` nodes are the nodes
that can accept writes. MongoDB's replication is
"single-master:" only one node can accept write operations at a time.

In a replica set, if a the current "primary" node fails or becomes
inaccessible, the other members can autonomously :term:`elect
<election>` one of the other members of the set to be the new "primary".

By default, clients send all reads to the primary;
however, ":term:`read preference`" is configurable at the
client level on a per-connection basis, which makes it possible to
send reads to secondary nodes instead.

What do the terms "secondary" and "slave" mean?
-----------------------------------------------

:term:`Secondary` and :term:`slave` nodes are read-only nodes
that replicate from the :term:`primary`.

Replication operates by way of an :term:`oplog`, from which secondary/slave
members apply new operations to themselves. This replication process
is asynchronous, so secondary/slave nodes may not always reflect the
latest writes to the primary. But usually, the gap between the primary and
secondary nodes is just few milliseconds on a local network connection.

How long does replica set failover take?
----------------------------------------

It varies, but a replica set will select a new primary within a minute.

It may take 10-30 seconds for the members of a :term:`replica
set` to declare a :term:`primary` inaccessible. This
triggers an :term:`election`. During the election, the cluster
is unavailable for writes.

The election itself may take another 10-30 seconds.

.. note::

   :term:`Eventually consistent <eventual consistency>` reads, like the ones that will return
   from a replica set are only possible with a :term:`write concern`
   that permits reads from :term:`secondary` members.


Does replication work over the Internet and WAN connections?
------------------------------------------------------------

Yes.

For example, a deployment may maintain a :term:`primary` and :term:`secondary`
in an East-coast data center along with a :term:`secondary` member for disaster
recovery in a West-coast data center.

.. seealso:: ":doc:`/tutorial/deploy-geographically-distributed-replica-set`"

Can MongoDB replicate over a "noisy" connection?
------------------------------------------------

Yes, but not without connection failures and the obvious latency.

Members of the set will attempt to reconnect to the other members of
the set in response to networking flaps. This does not require
administrator intervention. However, if the network connections
between the nodes in the replica set are very slow, it might not be
possible for the members of the node to keep up with the replication.

If the TCP connection between the secondaries and the :term:`primary`
instance breaks, a :term:`replica set` the set will automatically
elect one of the :term:`secondary` members of the set as primary.

What is the preferred replication method: master/slave or replica sets?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.8

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` are the preferred
:term:`replication` mechanism in MongoDB. However, if your deployment
requires more than 12 nodes, you must use master/slave replication.

What is the preferred replication method: replica sets or replica pairs?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. deprecated:: 1.6

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` replaced :term:`replica pairs` in
version 1.6. :term:`Replica sets <replica set>` are the preferred
:term:`replication` mechanism in MongoDB.

Why use journaling if replication already provides data redundancy?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

:term:`Journaling <journal>` facilitates faster crash recovery.
Prior to journaling, crashes often required :dbcommand:`database repairs <repairDatabase>`
or full data resync. Both were slow, and the first was unreliable.

Journaling is particularly useful for protection
against power failures, especially if your replica set resides in a single data
center or power circuit.

When a :term:`replica set` runs with journaling, :program:`mongod`
instances can safely restart without any administrator intervention.

.. note::

   Journaling requires some resource overhead for write
   operations. Journaling has no effect on read performance, however.

   Journaling is enabled by default on all 64-bit
   builds of MongoDB v2.0 and greater.

Are write operations durable without ``getLastError``?
------------------------------------------------------

Yes.

However, if you want confirmation that a given write has arrived
safely at the server, you must also run the :dbcommand:`getLastError`
command after each write. If you enable your driver's :term:`write
concern`, or "safe mode", the driver will automatically send
:dbcommand:`getLastError` this command. If you want to guarantee that
a given write syncs to the journal, you must pass the ``{j: true}``
option :dbcommand:`getLastError` (or specify it as part of the write
concern).

How many arbiters do replica sets need?
---------------------------------------

Some configurations do not require any :term:`arbiter`
instances. Arbiters vote in :term:`elections <election>`
for :term:`primary` but do not replicate the data like
:term:`secondary` members.

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` require a majority of the
original nodes present to elect a primary. Arbiters allow you
to construct this majority without the overhead of adding replicating
nodes to the system.

There are many possible replica set :doc:`architectures
</administration/replication-architectures>`.

If you have a three node replica set, you don't need an arbiter.

But a common configuration consists of two replicating nodes, one of which is
:term:`primary` and the other is :term:`secondary`, as well as an
arbiter for the third node. This configuration makes it possible for
the set to elect a primary in the event of a failure without requiring
three replicating nodes.

You may also consider adding an arbiter to a set if it has an equal
number of nodes in two facilities and network partitions between the
facilities are possible. In these cases, the arbiter will break
the tie between the two facilities and allow the set to elect a new
primary.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/administration/replication-architectures`

What information do arbiters exchange with replica sets?
--------------------------------------------------------

Arbiters never receive the contents of a collection but do exchange the
following data with the rest of the replica set:

- Credentials used to authenticate the arbiter with the replica set. All
  MongoDB processes within a replica set use keyfiles. These exchanges
  are encrypted.

- Replica set configuration data and voting data. This information is
  not encrypted. Only credential exchanges are encrypted.

If your MongoDB deployment uses SSL, then all communications between
arbiters and the other members of the replica set are secure. See the
documentation for :doc:`/administration/ssl` for more information. Run
all arbiters on secure networks, as with all MongoDB components.

Which members of a replica set vote in elections?
-------------------------------------------------

All members of a replica set, unless the value of :data:`votes
<members[n].votes>` is equal to ``0`` vote in elections. This includes
all :ref:`delayed <replica-set-delayed-members>`, :ref:`hidden
<replica-set-hidden-members>` and all :ref:`secondary-only
<replica-set-secondary-only-members>` members as well as the
:ref:`arbiters <replica-set-arbiters>`.
