Introduction to MongoDB
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB is an open-source *document database* that provides high
performance, high availability, and automatic scaling. MongoDB obviates
the need for an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) to facilitate
development.

Documents
---------

A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed
of field and value pairs. MongoDB documents are similar to JSON
objects. The values of fields may include other documents, arrays,
and arrays of documents.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      _id: 1,
      item: "abc1",
      details: {
         model: "xyz123",
         color: "brown"
      },
      stock: [ 
        { size: "S", qty: 25 },
        { size: "M", qty: 30 }
      ],
      category: "clothing"
   }

Collections
-----------

MongoDB stores documents in collections. Collections are analogous to
tables in relational databases. Unlike a table, however, a collection
does not require its documents to have the same schema.

In MongoDB, documents stored in a collection must have a unique ``_id``
field that acts as a :term:`primary key`.

Additional Information
----------------------

See the :doc:`Installation Guides </installation>` for instructions on
installing MongoDB.

The :manual:`Documents</core/document/>` page provides more information
on documents.

:manual:`SQL to MongoDB Mapping Chart </reference/sql-comparison>`
provides SQL queries and the MongoDB equivalents.
