You can access the configuration of a :term:`replica set` using the
:method:`rs.conf()` method or the :dbcommand:`replSetGetConfig` command.

To modify the configuration for a replica set, use the
:method:`rs.reconfig()` method, passing a configuration document to the
method. See :method:`rs.reconfig()` for more information.

Replica Set Configuration Fields
--------------------------------

.. rsconf::  _id

   *Type*: string

   The name of the replica set. Once set, you cannot change the
   name of a replica set.

   :rsconf:`_id` *must* be identical to the
   :setting:`replication.replSetName` or the value of `--replSet`
   specified to :binary:`~bin.mongod` on the command line.

   .. see::
      :setting:`~replication.replSetName` or :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`
      for information on setting the replica set name.

.. rsconf::  version

   *Type*: int

   An incrementing number used to distinguish revisions of the replica
   set configuration object from previous iterations of the
   configuration.

.. rsconf:: configsvr

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

   *Type*: boolean

   *Default*: false

   Indicates whether the replica set is used for a sharded cluster's
   config servers. Set to ``true`` if the replica set is for a sharded
   cluster's config servers.

   .. seealso:: :ref:`3.2-rel-notes-sharded-cluster`

.. rsconf:: protocolVersion

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

   *Type*: number

   *Default*: 1 for new replica sets

   Version of the :ref:`replica set election protocol
   <3.2-rel-notes-rs-enhancements>`.

   Starting in MongoDB 3.2, new replica sets use ``protocolVersion: 1`` by default.
   Previous versions of MongoDB use version 0 of the protocol and
   cannot run as members of a replica set configuration that specifies
   ``protocolVersion`` 1.
   
   .. seealso:: :doc:`/reference/replica-set-protocol-versions`

.. rsconf:: writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault

   .. versionadded:: 3.2.6

   *Type*: boolean

   *Default*: true if ``protocolVersion`` is 1 and false if ``protocolVersion`` is 0

   Determines the behavior of :writeconcern:`{ w: "majority" }
   <"majority">` write concern if the write concern does not explicitly
   specify the journal option :ref:`j <wc-j>`.
   
   The following table lists the ``writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault``
   values and the associated :writeconcern:`{ w: "majority" }
   <"majority">` behavior:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 85

      * - Value
        - ``{ w: "majority" }`` Behavior

      * - true

        - MongoDB acknowledges the write operation after a majority of
          the voting members have written to the on-disk journal.

          .. important::

             All voting members of the replica set must run with
             journaling when ``writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault``
             is ``true``.

             .. include:: /includes/extracts/no-journaling-writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault-true.rst

      * - false

        - MongoDB acknowledges the write operation after a majority of
          the voting members have applied the operation in
          memory.

          .. warning::

             .. include:: /includes/extracts/no-journaling-writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault-false.rst

   .. seealso:: :ref:`wc-ack-behavior`, :doc:`/reference/replica-set-protocol-versions`

``members``
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. rsconf::  members

   *Type*: array

   An array of member configuration documents, one for each member
   of the replica set. The :rsconf:`members` array
   is a zero-indexed array.

   Each member-specific configuration document can contain the following
   fields:

   .. rsconf::  members[n]._id

      *Type*: integer

      An integer identifier of every member in the replica set.
      Values must be between 0 and 255 inclusive. Each replica set member
      must have a unique :rsconf:`_id<members[n]._id>`.
      Once set, you cannot change the :rsconf:`_id<members[n]._id>` of a member.

      .. note::

         .. include:: /includes/fact-rs-conf-array-index.rst

   .. rsconf::  members[n].host

      *Type*: string

      The hostname and, if specified, the port number, of the set
      member.

      The hostname name must be resolvable for every host in the
      replica set.

      .. warning::

         :rsconf:`members[n].host` cannot hold a
         value that resolves to ``localhost`` or the local interface
         unless *all* members of the set are on hosts that resolve to
         ``localhost``.

   .. rsconf::  members[n].arbiterOnly

      *Optional*.

      *Type*: boolean

      *Default*: false

      A boolean that identifies an arbiter. A value of ``true``
      indicates that the member is an arbiter.

      When using the :method:`rs.addArb()` method to add an arbiter,
      the method automatically sets
      :rsconf:`members[n].arbiterOnly` to ``true``
      for the added member.

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/arbiters-and-pvs-with-reference.rst

   .. rsconf::  members[n].buildIndexes

      *Optional*.

      *Type*: boolean

      *Default*: true

      A boolean that indicates whether the :binary:`~bin.mongod` builds
      :term:`indexes <index>` on this member. You can only set this
      value when adding a member to a replica set. You cannot change
      :rsconf:`members[n].buildIndexes` field after
      the member has been added to the set. To add a member, see
      :method:`rs.add()` and :method:`rs.reconfig()`.

      Do not set to ``false`` for :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances that receive
      queries from clients.

      Setting ``buildIndexes`` to ``false`` may be useful if **all**
      the following conditions are true:

      - you are only using this instance to perform backups using
        :binary:`~bin.mongodump`, *and*

      - this member will receive no queries, *and*

      - index creation and maintenance overburdens the host
        system.

      Even if set to ``false``, secondaries *will* build indexes on the
      ``_id`` field in order to facilitate operations required for
      replication.

      .. warning::

         If you set
         :rsconf:`members[n].buildIndexes` to
         ``false``, you must also set
         :rsconf:`members[n].priority` to ``0``. If
         :rsconf:`members[n].priority` is not
         ``0``, MongoDB will return an error when attempting to add a
         member with
         :rsconf:`members[n].buildIndexes` equal to
         ``false``.

         To ensure the member receives no queries, you should make all
         instances that do not build indexes hidden.

         Other secondaries cannot replicate from a member where
         :rsconf:`members[n].buildIndexes` is
         false.

   .. rsconf::  members[n].hidden

      *Optional*.

      *Type*: boolean

      *Default*: false

      When this value is ``true``, the replica set hides this instance
      and does not include the member in the output of
      :method:`db.isMaster()` or :dbcommand:`isMaster`. This prevents
      read operations (i.e. queries) from ever reaching this host by
      way of secondary :term:`read preference`.

      Hidden members can acknowledge write operations
      issued with :ref:`write-concern`. For write operations issued
      with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern, the member must
      also be a voting member (i.e. :rsconf:`~members[n].votes` is
      greater than ``0``).

      .. seealso::
         :ref:`Hidden Replica Set Members <replica-set-hidden-members>`

   .. rsconf::  members[n].priority

      *Optional*.

      *Type*: Number, between 0 and 1000.

      *Default*: 1.0

      A number that indicates the relative eligibility of a member to
      become a :term:`primary`.

      Specify higher values to make a member *more* eligible to become
      :term:`primary`, and lower values to make the member *less*
      eligible. A member with a :rsconf:`members[n].priority` of ``0`` is
      ineligible to become primary.

      .. include:: /includes/fact-rs-nonzero-priority-vote-restriction.rst

      Changing the balance of priority in a replica set will trigger
      one or more elections. If a lower priority secondary is elected
      over a higher priority secondary, replica set members will
      continue to call elections until the highest priority available
      member becomes primary.

      Members with :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` of ``0`` can 
      acknowledge write operations issued with :ref:`write-concern`. 
      For write operations issued with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write 
      concern, the member must also be a voting member (i.e. 
      :rsconf:`~members[n].votes` is greater than ``0``).

      .. seealso::
         :ref:`Replica Set Elections <replica-set-elections>`.

   .. rsconf::  members[n].tags

      *Optional*.

      *Type*: document

      *Default*: none

      .. include:: /includes/fact-tag-set-field.rst

      Use :rsconf:`replicaset.members[n].tags` to
      configure write concerns in conjunction with
      :rsconf:`settings.getLastErrorModes` and
      :rsconf:`settings.getLastErrorDefaults`.

      .. include:: /includes/fact-tag-sets-must-be-strings.rst

      For more information on configuring tag sets for read preference
      and write concern, see
      :doc:`/tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets`.

   .. rsconf::  members[n].slaveDelay

      *Optional*.

      *Type*: integer

      *Default*: 0

      The number of seconds "behind" the primary that this
      replica set member should "lag".

      Use this option to create :ref:`delayed members
      <replica-set-delayed-members>`. Delayed members maintain a copy
      of the data that reflects the state of the data at some time in
      the past.

      Delayed members can contribute to acknowledging write
      operations issued with :ref:`write-concern`. However,
      they return write acknowledgment no earlier than the configured
      delay value. For write operations issued with 
      :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern, the member must also be 
      a voting member (i.e. :rsconf:`~members[n].votes` is greater than 
      ``0``).

      .. seealso::
         :doc:`/core/replica-set-delayed-member`

   .. rsconf::  members[n].votes

      *Optional*.

      *Type*: integer

      *Default*: 1

      The number of votes a server will cast in a :ref:`replica set
      election <replica-set-elections>`. The number of votes each
      member has is either ``1`` or ``0``, and :ref:`arbiters
      <replica-set-arbiters>` always have exactly ``1`` vote.

      .. include:: /includes/fact-rs-nonzero-priority-vote-restriction.rst

      A replica set can have up to :limit:`50 members
      <Number of Members of a Replica Set>` but only 7 voting members.
      If you need more than 7 members in one replica set, set
      :rsconf:`members[n].votes` to ``0`` for the
      additional non-voting members.
      
      .. versionchanged:: 3.2
      
         .. include:: /includes/fact-rs-non-voting-priority-restriction.rst

      .. include:: /includes/members-used-to-allow-multiple-votes.rst

      Members with ``0`` votes cannot acknowledge write operations
      issued with a :ref:`write-concern` of :writeconcern:`majority`.

``settings``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. rsconf::  settings

   *Optional*.

   *Type*: document

   A document that contains configuration options that apply to the
   whole replica set.

   The :rsconf:`settings` document contain the
   following fields:

   .. rsconf::  settings.chainingAllowed

      *Optional*.

      *Type*: boolean

      *Default*: true

      When :rsconf:`settings.chainingAllowed` is
      ``true``, the replica set allows :term:`secondary` members to
      replicate from other secondary members. When
      :rsconf:`settings.chainingAllowed` is
      ``false``, secondaries can replicate only from the :term:`primary`.

      .. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/manage-chained-replication`

   .. rsconf::  settings.getLastErrorDefaults

      *Optional*.

      *Type*: document

      A document that specifies the :doc:`write concern
      </core/replica-set-write-concern>` for the replica set. The
      replica set will use this write concern only when :ref:`write
      operations <write-methods-incompatibility>` or
      :dbcommand:`getLastError` specify no other write concern.

      If :rsconf:`settings.getLastErrorDefaults` is
      not set, the default write concern for the replica set only
      requires confirmation from the primary.

   .. rsconf::  settings.getLastErrorModes

      *Optional*.

      *Type*: document

      A document used to define an extended :term:`write concern`
      through the use of :rsconf:`members[n].tags`.
      The extended :term:`write concern` can provide :term:`data-center
      awareness`.

      For example, the following document defines an extended write
      concern named ``eastCoast`` and associates with a write to a
      member that has the ``east`` tag.

      .. code-block:: none

         { getLastErrorModes: { eastCoast: { "east": 1 } } }

      Write operations to the replica set can use the extended write
      concern, e.g. ``{ w: "eastCoast" }``.

      See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets` for more
      information and example.

   .. rsconf::  settings.heartbeatTimeoutSecs

      *Optional*.

      *Type*: int

      *Default*: 10

      Number of seconds that the replica set members wait for a
      successful heartbeat from each other. If a member does not
      respond in time, other members mark the delinquent member as
      inaccessible.

      The setting only applies when using :rsconf:`protocolVersion: 0`. 
      When using :rsconf:`protocolVersion: 1` the relevant setting is 
      :rsconf:`settings.electionTimeoutMillis`.

   .. rsconf::  settings.electionTimeoutMillis

      .. versionadded:: 3.2

      *Optional*.

      *Type*: int

      *Default*: 10000 (10 seconds)

      The time limit in milliseconds for detecting when a replica set's
      primary is unreachable:

      - Higher values result in slower failovers but decreased
        sensitivity to primary node or network slowness or spottiness.

      - Lower values result in faster failover, but increased
        sensitivity to primary node or network slowness or spottiness.

      The setting only applies when using :rsconf:`protocolVersion: 1`.
      
   .. rsconf::  settings.catchUpTimeoutMillis

      .. versionadded:: 3.4

      *Optional*.

      *Type*: int

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 50 50

         * - Default Value
           - MongoDB Version

         * - 60000 (60 seconds)
           - 3.4.6+

         * - 2000 (2 seconds)
           - 3.4.0 - 3.4.5

      Time limit in milliseconds for a newly elected primary to sync
      (catch up) with the other replica set members that may have more
      recent writes. Infinite or high time limits may reduce the
      amount of data that the other members would need to roll back
      after an election but may increase the failover time.

      The newly elected primary ends the catchup period early once it
      is fully caught up with other members of the set. During the
      catchup period, the newly elected primary is unavailable for
      writes from clients. Use :dbcommand:`replSetAbortPrimaryCatchUp`
      to abort the catchup then complete the transition to primary.

      The setting only applies when using :rsconf:`protocolVersion: 1`.

   .. rsconf::  settings.heartbeatIntervalMillis

      .. versionadded:: 3.2

      *Internal use only*.

      The frequency in milliseconds of the heartbeats.

   .. rsconf::  settings.replicaSetId

      .. versionadded:: 3.2

      *Type*: ObjectId

      The ObjectId associated with the replica set and automatically
      created during :method:`rs.initiate()` or
      :dbcommand:`replSetInitate`. You cannot change the
      :setting:`~settings.replicaSetId`.
