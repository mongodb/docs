title: "In |aws|, enable :guilabel:`DNS hostnames` and :guilabel:`DNS resolution`."

content: |

  a. Log in to your |aws| account.

  #. Go to the `VPC dashboard <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc>`_.

  #. Open your list of |vpc| resources.

  #. Select the |vpc| you want to peer with.

  #. Enable :guilabel:`DNS hostnames` and :guilabel:`DNS
     resolution` to ensure that the cluster's hostnames in standard
     connection strings automatically resolve to private instead of
     public IP addresses when the |service| cluster is accessed from
     within the :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>`. 
      
     If :guilabel:`DNS hostnames` and :guilabel:`DNS resolution` are disabled 
     and the :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>` is accessible to the internet, the |dns| 
     resolves the cluster's hostnames to their public |ipaddr| address
     rather than their internal |ipaddr| address. 
      
     To learn more about how to enable these options, see :aws:`Updating
     DNS Support for Your VPC
     </AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-updating>`.

     .. note:: 

        If the applications deployed within |aws| use custom |dns|
        services and :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>` peering with |service|,
        see :ref:`FAQ <atlas-faq-custom-dns>` for more information on
        how to connect using private connection strings.

  #. In the :guilabel:`Peering Connection` modal, select
     :guilabel:`AWS` and click :guilabel:`Next`.

  #. To create the |vpc| Peering connection, fill in the
     requested information in the :guilabel:`Peering Connection` modal:

     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 35 65

        * - Field
          - Notes

        * - :guilabel:`Account ID`

          - |aws| Account ID of the owner of the peer |vpc|.
            Refer to the dialog for instructions on finding your
            :guilabel:`AWS Account ID`.

        * - :guilabel:`VPC ID`

          - Unique identifier of the peer |vpc|. Refer to the
            dialog for instructions on finding your
            :guilabel:`VPC ID`.

        * - :guilabel:`VPC CIDR`

          - |aws| |vpc| |cidr| block or subset. Must not
            overlap with your :guilabel:`Atlas CIDR Block` or any
            other Network Peering connection :guilabel:`VPC CIDR`.

            The |cidr| block must be in one of the following
            :rfc:`private networks <1918#section-3>`:

            - ``10.0.0.0`` - ``10.255.255.255``  (10/8 prefix)

            - ``172.16.0.0`` - ``172.31.255.255``  (172.16/12 prefix)

            - ``192.168.0.0`` - ``192.168.255.255`` (192.168/16 prefix)

            You can choose to add the |vpc| |cidr| block address
            (or a subset) to the IP access list. For Network Peering
            connections, you can also add the Security Group
            associated with the |aws| |vpc| instead of the
            |cidr| block. See :ref:`add-to-access-list`.

            To learn more about |cidr| blocks, see
            :rfc:`RFC 4632 <4632>`.

            .. include:: /includes/fact-vpc-cidr-block.rst

        * - :guilabel:`Application VPC Region`

          - |aws| region where the |aws| |vpc| resides.

        * - :guilabel:`VPC CIDR`

          - |aws| |vpc| |cidr| block. Must not overlap with
            the |service| :guilabel:`VPC CIDR` block.

        * - :guilabel:`Atlas VPC Region`

          - |aws| region where the |service| |vpc| resides.
            |service| creates a |vpc| for the |service| project
            in this region if no ``M10+`` clusters or |vpc|
            peering connections exist for the selected
            :guilabel:`Region`.

            Uncheck :guilabel:`Same as application VPC region`
            to select a different region than where the
            application |vpc| resides.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Initiate Peering`.

  #. Wait for approval of peering connection request.

     The owner of the peer |vpc| must approve the |vpc| peering
     connection request. Ensure that the owner approves the
     request.

     |service| provides instructions for approving the connection request.

     .. important:: Requests expire after 7 days.

  a. In the :guilabel:`VPC Dashboard`, click
     :guilabel:`Route Tables`.

  #. Select the Route Table for your |vpc|.

  #. Click the :guilabel:`Routes` tab.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Edit Routes`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Add route`.

  #. Add the |service| |vpc|\'s |cidr| block to the
     :guilabel:`Destination` column.

  #. Add the AWS Peering Connection ID to the
     :guilabel:`Target` column.

     This value is prefixed with ``pcx-``.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

     .. include:: /includes/fact-vpc-peering-connections-max.rst

     Once set up, you can edit or terminate |vpc| peering
     connection from the :guilabel:`Peering` table.
