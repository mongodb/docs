Often, the quickest way to get support for general questions is through the
:community-forum:`MongoDB Community Forums </tag/cxx>`
or through
`Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb%20c%2b%2b>`__.

Please also refer to MongoDB's
`support channels <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/support>`__ documentation.
