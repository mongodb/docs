Neurelo is a platform for developers designed to simplify the process of working
with databases. It provides a database abstraction with API-first
approach, instantly transforming databases into REST and GraphQL APIs.

Neurelo offers features such as building and managing schemas with
Text-to-Schema support, fully-documented REST and GraphQL APIs (with SDKs)
generated from your schema with an API  playground, custom API endpoints for
complex queries with Text-to-MQL support, multiple CI/CD environments,
schema-aware mock data generation, and more.

This abstraction layer enables developers to program with databases through
APIs, simplifying communication between the application and the database, and
making it easier and faster to integrate databases into their applications.
