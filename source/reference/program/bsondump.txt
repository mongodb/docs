.. _bsondump:

============
``bsondump``
============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

The :program:`bsondump` converts :term:`BSON` files into human-readable
formats, including :term:`JSON`. For example, :program:`bsondump` is useful
for reading the output files generated by :program:`mongodump`.

.. important:: :program:`bsondump` is a diagnostic tool for inspecting
   BSON files, not a tool for data ingestion or other application use.

Options

.. binary:: bsondump

.. program:: bsondump

.. option:: <bsonfilename>

   The final argument to :program:`bsondump` is a document containing
   :term:`BSON`. This data is typically generated by
   :program:`mongodump` or by MongoDB in a :term:`rollback` operation.

Use
---

By default, :program:`bsondump` outputs data to standard output. To
create corresponding :term:`JSON` files, you will need to use the
shell redirect. See the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   bsondump collection.bson > collection.json

Use the following command (at the system shell) to produce debugging
output for a :term:`BSON` file:

.. code-block:: sh

   bsondump --type=debug collection.bson
