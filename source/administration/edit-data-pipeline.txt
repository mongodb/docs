You can make changes to your {+dl+} pipelines through the |service| 
|ui| and {+dl+} Pipelines |api|, including:

- Edit the data extraction schedule
- Edit the data storage region
- Change the fields to exclude from your {+dl+} datasets

.. _adl-edit-dataset-pipeline-ui:

Edit a Pipeline from the |service| UI  
-------------------------------------

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Log in to `MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`__.

   .. step::  Select :guilabel:`Data Lake` under :guilabel:`Deployment` on the left-hand navigation.

   .. step:: Click :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` in the :guilabel:`Actions` column for the pipeline that you wish to modify.

   .. step:: (Optional) Make changes to your data extraction schedule. 

      Before making changes to your :guilabel:`Basic Schedule`, ensure 
      that your desired data extraction frequency is similar to your 
      current backup schedule. For example, if you wish to switch to 
      ``Daily``, you must have a ``Daily`` backup schedule configured 
      in your policy. Or, if you want to switch to a schedule of once a 
      week, you must have a ``Weekly`` backup schedule configured in 
      your policy. To learn more, see :atlas:`Backup Scheduling 
      </backup/cloud-backup/overview/#backup-scheduling--retention--and-on-demand-backup-snapshots>`. 
      You can also send a ``GET`` request to the {+dl+} 
      :oas-atlas-op:`availableSchedules 
      </returnAvailableSchedulesForPipeline>` endpoint to retrieve the 
      list of backup schedule policy items that you can use to change 
      the schedule of your {+dl+} pipeline.

   .. step:: (Optional) Make changes to your data storage region.

      {+adl+} provides optimized storage in the following |aws| regions:

      .. include:: /includes/list-table-supported-aws-regions.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Continue`.

   .. step:: (Optional) Make changes to the fields excluded from your {+dl+} datasets.

      - Click :guilabel:`Add Field` and specify :guilabel:`Field Name` 
        to add fields to the excluded fields list.

      - Click :guilabel:`Delete All` to remove all the fields from the 
        excluded fields list. 

      - Click :icon:`trash-alt` next to a field to remove that  
        field from the excluded fields list.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Review Changes` to review the changes to your pipeline.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Apply Changes` for the changes to take effect.

.. _adl-edit-dataset-pipeline-api:

Edit a Pipeline from the API  
----------------------------

To edit a pipeline through the |api|, send a ``PATCH`` request to the 
:oas-atlas-tag:`{+dl+} </Data-Lake-Pipelines>` ``pipelines`` endpoint 
with the name of the pipeline that you want to edit. To learn more 
about the ``pipelines`` endpoint syntax and parameters for updating a 
pipeline, see :oas-atlas-op:`Update One Data Lake Pipeline 
</updateOneDataLakePipeline>`.

.. tip:: 

   You can send a ``GET`` request to the 
   :oas-atlas-op:`availableSchedules 
   </returnAvailableSchedulesForPipeline>` endpoint to retrieve the 
   list of backup schedule policy items that you can use to change the 
   schedule of your {+dl+} pipelines of type ``PERIODIC_DPS``.
