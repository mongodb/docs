|workload| lets your applications access MongoDB |mms| 
deployments using external programmatic identities such as Azure Service 
Principals, Azure Managed Identities and Google Service 
Accounts.

How it Works
-------------

|workload| allows your applications access to MongoDB 
deployments with OAuth 2.0 access tokens. The access tokens can be issued by 
any external Identity Provider including Azure Entra ID and Google Cloud 
Platform. |mms| stores the user identifiers and privileges, but 
not the secrets. This authentication mechanism for your applications 
is only supported by :ref:`certain MongoDB drivers <cm-connect-oidc-workload>`. 

MongoDB Drivers support two types of authentication flow for |workload|: 
Built-in Authentication and Callback Authentication. 

Built-in Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use built-in authentication if you deploy your application on a 
supported infrastructure with a supported principal type. Your application 
can access |mms| deployments without supplying a password or 
manually requesting a |jwt| from your cloud provider's metadata service. Instead, 
your chosen MongoDB driver uses your existing principal identifier to request a 
JWT access token under the hood, which is then passed to the |mms| deployment
automatically when your application connects. 

For more implementation details, see :ref:`your chosen driver's documentation 
<cm-connect-oidc-workload>`.

Callback Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use callback authentication with any service supporting OAuth 2.0 
access tokens. {+workload+} calls a callback method, in which you can request 
the required |jwt| from your authorization server or cloud provider that you must 
pass when your application connects to |mms| with |workload|. 

Please review :ref:`your chosen driver's <cm-connect-oidc-workload>` 
documentation for additional implementation details. 

Required Access
---------------

To configure {+workload+}, you must have
:authrole:`Project Owner` access to |mms|.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must have the following:

- MongoDB 7.0 or later.
- At least one other authentication mechanism with {+mdbagent+} configured.

  .. note:: 
     
     The {+mdbagent+} cannot connect to your deployment via |oidc|. You must
     enable an additional auth mechanism for the {+mdbagent+}. If |mms| 
     doesn't manage {+magent+} or {+bagent+}, you must manually configure
     them to use the alternative authentication mechanism.

Procedures
----------

To configure {+workload+}, complete the following steps:

1. Configure a Workload Identity Provider (one-time setup).
   
   a. :ref:`Configure your external identity provider <cm-configure-idp-oidc-workload>`.

   b. :ref:`Configure workload Identity Provider in Cloud Manager <cm-configure-oidc-auth-workload>`.

2. :ref:`Grant external identities (user principals) or groups access <cm-create-oidc-user-workload>`.

3. :ref:`Authenticate to your Cloud Manager deployment <cm-connect-oidc-workload>`.

Configure An External Identity Provider Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/note-reset-auth.rst

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Azure
      :tabid: azure-oauth

      In order to access |mms| deployments with Azure Managed Identities 
      or Azure Service Principals, you need to register an Azure Entra ID 
      application. If you have an existing application registration for 
      :ref:`Workload <cm-oidc-authentication-workload>` (human user) access,
      we recommended that you register a separate application for Workload access.

      .. include:: /includes/steps-register-oidc-application-azure-workload.rst

   .. tab:: GCP
      :tabid: gcp-oauth

      You don't need to make any configuration changes in your |gcp| account.

.. _cm-configure-oidc-auth-workload:

Configure {+workload+} Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
.. note::

   {+workload+} supports only JWT for authentication. It doesn't 
   support opaque access tokens.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Azure
      :tabid: azure-oauth

      To configure a {+workload+} |idp-full| with Azure Entra ID in |mms|:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-enable-authentication-oidc-workload-azure.rst

      
   .. tab:: GCP
      :tabid: GCP-oauth

      To configure a {+workload+} |idp-full| with |gcp| in |mms|:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-enable-authentication-oidc-workload-gcp.rst


.. _cm-create-oidc-user-workload:

Configure OIDC Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB does not explicitly create database users for |oidc|. It maps
|oidc| users to MongoDB roles based on the configuration.

Select a tab depending on the authorization type that you selected
when :ref:`configuring OIDC authentication <cm-configure-oidc-auth-workload>`.
            
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: User ID
      :tabid: user

      If you selected the ``User ID`` authorization type, 
      create a new user to grant an individual user authorization:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/configure-oidc-user.rst

   .. tab:: Group Membership
      :tabid: group

      If you selected the ``Group Membership`` authorization type,
      complete the following steps to create a custom role that grants
      authorization based on |idp| user group membership:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-configure-oidc-user-group.rst

.. _cm-connect-oidc-workload:

Connect an Application to MongoDB with {+workload+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following MongoDB Drivers to connect an application to MongoDB
with {+workload+} authentication:

- :ref:`Java <java-authentication-oidc>`
- :driver:`C#/.NET </csharp/current/fundamentals/authentication/>`
- :driver:`Go </go/current/fundamentals/enterprise-auth/#mongodb-oidc>`
- :ref:`PyMongo <pymongo-enterprise-auth>`
- :ref:`Node <node-mongodb-oidc-azure-imds>` / :driver:`Typescript </typescript>`
- :driver:`Kotlin </kotlin/coroutine/current/fundamentals/enterprise-auth/#mongodb-oidc>`
- :website:`Scala </docs/languages/scala/scala-driver/>`

Manage an Existing {+workload+} Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------

To manage your {+workload+} configuration,
you can perform the following actions.

.. _cm-revoke-workload-jwks-token:

Revoke JWKS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   
   Don't use this feature to rotate your signing keys. When you rotate 
   your |oidc| |idp| signing keys, MongoDB fetches the JWKS automatically
   upon expiration of the existing access tokens.

If your private key is compromised, you can immediately revoke your JSON
Web Key Sets (JWKS) cached in MongoDB nodes:

.. include:: /includes/steps-remove-oidc-jwks-token.rst

Edit a Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To edit your {+workload+} configuration:

.. include:: /includes/steps-edit-oidc-configuration.rst
      
Delete a Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete your {+workload+} configuration:

.. include:: /includes/steps-delete-oidc-configuration.rst
