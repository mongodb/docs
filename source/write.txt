Overview
--------

On this page, you can see copyable code examples that show common methods you
can use to write data to MongoDB by using the {+driver-short+}.

.. tip::

  To learn more about any of the methods shown on this page, see the link
  provided in each section.

To use an example from this page, copy the code example into the :ref:`sample
application <scala-write-sample>` or your own application. Be sure to replace all
placeholders in the code examples, such as ``<connection string URI>``, with the
relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.

Insert One 
----------

The following code shows how to insert a single document into a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/WriteCodeExamples.scala
   :start-after: start-insert-one
   :end-before: end-insert-one
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``insertOne()`` method, see the
:ref:`Insert Documents <scala-write-insert>` guide.

Insert Multiple
---------------

The following code shows how to insert multiple documents into a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/WriteCodeExamples.scala
   :start-after: start-insert-many
   :end-before: end-insert-many
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``insertMany()`` method, see the
:ref:`Insert Documents <scala-write-insert>` guide.

Update One
----------

The following code shows how to update a single document in a collection by
creating or editing a field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/WriteCodeExamples.scala
   :start-after: start-update-one
   :end-before: end-update-one
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``updateOne()`` method, see the
:ref:`scala-write-update` guide.

Update Multiple
---------------

The following code shows how to update multiple documents in a collection by
creating or editing a field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/WriteCodeExamples.scala
   :start-after: start-update-many
   :end-before: end-update-many
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``updateMany()`` method, see the
:ref:`scala-write-update` guide.

Replace One
-----------

The following code shows how to replace a single document in a collection with a new
document:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/WriteCodeExamples.scala
   :start-after: start-replace-one
   :end-before: end-replace-one
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``replaceOne()`` method, see the
:ref:`Replace Documents <scala-write-replace>` guide.

Delete One
----------

The following code shows how to delete a single document in a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/WriteCodeExamples.scala
   :start-after: start-delete-one
   :end-before: end-delete-one
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``deleteOne()`` method, see the
:ref:`Delete Documents <scala-write-delete>` guide.

Delete Multiple
---------------

The following code shows how to delete multiple documents in a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/WriteCodeExamples.scala
   :start-after: start-delete-many
   :end-before: end-delete-many
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``deleteMany()`` method, see the
:ref:`Delete Documents <scala-write-delete>` guide.

Bulk Write 
----------

The following code shows how to perform multiple write operations in a single
bulk operation:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/WriteCodeExamples.scala
   :start-after: start-bulk-write
   :end-before: end-bulk-write
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:
