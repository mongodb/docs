==============================================
Use x.509 Certificates to Authenticate Clients
==============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 2.6

MongoDB supports x.509 certificate authentication for use with a secure
:doc:`SSL connection </tutorial/configure-ssl>`. The x.509 client
authentication allows :ref:`clients to authenticate to servers with
certificates <x509-client-authentication>` instead of with username and
password.

To use x.509 authentication for the internal authentication of replica
set/sharded cluster members, see
:doc:`configure-x509-member-authentication`.

.. _x509-client-authentication:

Client x.509 Certificate
------------------------

The client certificate must have the following
properties:

- A single Certificate Authority (CA) must issue the certificates
  for both the client and the server.

- Client certificates must contain the following fields:

  .. code-block:: none

     keyUsage = digitalSignature
     extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth

- Client x.509 certificate’s subject, which contains the Distinguished
  Name (``DN``), must differ from that of a
  :ref:`x509-member-certificate` to prevent client certificates from
  identifying the client as a cluster member and granting full
  permission on the system. Specifically, the subjects must differ with
  regards to at least one of the following attributes: Organization
  (``O``), the Organizational Unit (``OU``) or the Domain Component
  (``DC``).

- Each unique MongoDB user must have a unique certificate.

Configure MongoDB Server
------------------------

Use Command-line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configure the MongoDB server from the command line, as in the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslMode requireSSL --sslPEMKeyFile <path to SSL certificate and key PEM file> --sslCAFile <path to root CA PEM file>

Use Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may also specify these options in the :doc:`configuration file
</reference/configuration-options>`.

Starting in MongoDB 2.6, you can specify the configuration for MongoDB
in a :doc:`YAML format </reference/configuration-options>`, as in the
following example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   net:
      ssl:
         mode: requireSSL
         PEMKeyFile: <path to SSL certificate and key PEM file>
         CAFile: <path to root CA PEM file>

For backwards compatibility, you can also specify the configuration
using the :v2.4:`older configuration file format
</reference/configuration>`, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: none

   sslMode = requireSSL
   sslPEMKeyFile = <path to SSL certificate and key PEM file>
   sslCAFile = <path to the root CA PEM file>

Include any additional options, SSL or otherwise, that are required for
your specific configuration.

.. _addX509SubjectUser:

Add x.509 Certificate ``subject`` as a User
-------------------------------------------

To authenticate with a client certificate, you must first add the value
of the ``subject`` from the client certificate as a MongoDB user. Each
unique x.509 client certificate corresponds to a single MongoDB user;
i.e. you cannot use a single client certificate to authenticate more
than one MongoDB user.

#. You can retrieve the ``subject`` from the client certificate with
   the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      openssl x509 -in <pathToClient PEM> -inform PEM -subject -nameopt RFC2253

   The command returns the ``subject`` string as well as certificate:

   .. code-block:: sh

      subject= CN=myName,OU=myOrgUnit,O=myOrg,L=myLocality,ST=myState,C=myCountry
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      # ...
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----

#. Add the value of the ``subject``, omitting the spaces, from the
   certificate as a user.

   For example, in the :program:`mongo` shell, to add the user with
   both the ``readWrite`` role in the ``test`` database and the
   ``userAdminAnyDatabase`` role which is defined only in the ``admin``
   database:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("$external").runCommand(
        {
          createUser: "CN=myName,OU=myOrgUnit,O=myOrg,L=myLocality,ST=myState,C=myCountry",
          roles: [
                   { role: 'readWrite', db: 'test' },
                   { role: 'userAdminAnyDatabase', db: 'admin' }
                 ],
          writeConcern: { w: "majority" , wtimeout: 5000 }
        }
      )

   In the above example, to add the user with the ``readWrite`` role in
   the ``test`` database, the role specification document specified
   ``'test'`` in the ``db`` field. To add ``userAdminAnyDatabase``
   role for the user, the above example specified ``'admin'`` in the
   ``db`` field.

   .. note::
      Some roles are defined only in the ``admin`` database, including:
      ``clusterAdmin``, ``readAnyDatabase``, ``readWriteAnyDatabase``,
      ``dbAdminAnyDatabase``, and ``userAdminAnyDatabase``. To add a
      user with these roles, specify ``'admin'`` in the ``db``.

See :doc:`/tutorial/add-user-to-database` for details on adding a user
with roles.

Authenticate with a x.509 Certificate
-------------------------------------

To authenticate with a client certificate, you must first add a MongoDB
user that corresponds to the client certificate. See
:ref:`addX509SubjectUser`.

To authenticate, use the :method:`db.auth()` method in the
``$external`` database, specifying ``"MONGODB-X509"`` for the
``mechanism`` field, and the :ref:`user that corresponds to the client
certificate <addX509SubjectUser>` for the ``user`` field.

For example, if using the :program:`mongo` shell,

1. Connect :program:`mongo` shell to the :program:`mongod` set up for
   SSL:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo --ssl --sslPEMKeyFile <path to CA signed client PEM file>

#. To perform the authentication, use the :method:`db.auth()` method in
   the ``$external`` database. For the ``mechanism`` field, specify
   ``"MONGODB-X509"``, and for the ``user`` field, specify the user, or
   the ``subject``, that corresponds to the client certificate.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("$external").auth(
        {
          mechanism: "MONGODB-X509",
          user: "CN=myName,OU=myOrgUnit,O=myOrg,L=myLocality,ST=myState,C=myCountry"
        }
      )
