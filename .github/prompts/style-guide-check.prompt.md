You are making changes to some documentation to adhere to the following style guide.

Important:
- DO NOT change any special formatting or .rST formatting.
- DO NOT hallucinate or add new information.
- You can fix any typos or grammatical errors.
- Add line breaks to the content at 72 characters.

Once complete, list every change and its new line number in a bulleted list.

Here is the style guide:

# Use Active Voice
Active voice makes the performer the subject, while passive voice makes the recipient the subject.
Active voice is more engaging, less complicated, less wordy, and easier to understand.
Clarifies user actions vs. technology actions.
Examples:
Active: "Restart the service."
Passive: "The service can be restarted."
## When Do You Use Passive Voice?
Use passive voice to avoid blaming the user.
Use when active voice is wordy or awkward.
Use to emphasize the object over the performer.
Examples:
Passive: "The flag was set incorrectly."
Active: "You set the flag incorrectly."
# Use Present Tense
Use present tense for user actions: it's engaging and easier to read.
Use past tense for historical events or previous software releases.
Use future tense sparingly to avoid uncertainty.
Examples:
Present: "The product prompts you."
Future: "The product will prompt you."
# Use Second Person and Imperative Mood
## Write to the User
Use second person (you) to address the user directly for a friendly tone.
Use imperative mood for instructions to eliminate wordiness and confusion.
Avoid gender-specific pronouns; use gender-neutral ones.
Use first-person plural pronouns (we, our) judiciously.
Limit the use of first-person singular pronoun (I).
Avoid switching person in the same document.
Examples:
Use: "Click Yes to accept the license agreement."
Avoid: "The license agreement is accepted when the user clicks Yes."
# Avoid the Subjunctive Mood
Avoid words expressing doubt or uncertainty (should, could, would).
Aim for authoritative documentation.
Examples:
Use: "The logs download as a .CSV file."
Avoid: "The logs should download as a .CSV file."
# Write Clear and Concise Sentences and Paragraphs
## Use a Consistent Sentence Structure
Stick to subject-verb-object structure.
Use simple sentences for clarity.
Ensure conditional clauses are at the sentence start.
Examples:
Use: "Atlas truncates the value when stored as an integer."
Avoid: "Only when stored in an integer variable is the value truncated."
## Restrict Sentence Length
Limit sentences to 20-25 words.
Use multiple clauses if a longer sentence is needed.
Examples:
Use: "Atlas fetches a list of regions and displays the default tier."
Avoid: "Atlas fetches a list of regions, along with the cluster tier..."
### Limit Using Be as the Main Verb
Find and use action verbs instead of forms of be.
Examples:
Use: "This report analyzes the problem."
Avoid: "This report is an analysis of the problem."
### Avoid Expletive Structures
Rewrite sentences starting with It or There.
Examples:
Use: "We need to solve this problem."
Avoid: "It is necessary for us to find a solution to this problem."
### Avoid Nominalizations
Convert nouns derived from verbs back into verbs.
Examples:
Use: "The modal recommends upgrading."
Avoid: "The modal contains a recommendation to upgrade."
# Use the Necessary Words
Only use words necessary to convey the meaning.
Remove extraneous words like unnecessary adverbs, adjectives, and prepositional phrases.
Include necessary articles and syntactic cues.
Examples:
Use: "Use the product to create URLs."
Avoid: "A great feature implemented by the product is the ability to generate URLs."
# Create Short Paragraphs
Keep paragraphs to one idea and four to five sentences.
Avoid one-sentence paragraphs.
Use bullet lists for three or more items.
Examples:
Use: "- Run a generated script immediately."
Avoid: "From the Job Scheduler, run a script, schedule it, track jobsâ€¦"
## Create Effective Lists
Introduce a list with a contextual sentence, and end the sentence with a
colon.
Don't specify the number of items in the list in the introduction. 
Avoid using a fragment to introduce a list.
Use the following guidelines when writing list items:

-  Capitalize the first letter of each list item unless the first
   letter must be lowercase.
-  Make all list items parallel grammatically. For example, all items
   start with fragments, or all items use sentences.
-  Use the following guidelines for punctuation in lists:

   -  In a list of only sentences, including imperative statements, use
      punctuation at the end of each list item.
   -  In a list of only fragments, do not use punctuation at the end of
      any of the list items.
   -  In a list of fragments, some or all of which are followed by
      sentences, use punctuation at the end of every list item.

-  Don't connect separate list items with commas or conjunctions
   (*and*, *or*).

-  Avoid using articles (*a*, *an*, *the*) to start list items.
# Use Effective Verbs

## Dangling Modifiers

Examples:
Use: "Enter the username and password that you just created."
