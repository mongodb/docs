MongoDB Enterprise supports authentication using a Kerberos service.
Kerberos is an industry standard authentication protocol for large
client/server system. With Kerberos MongoDB and application ecosystems
can take advantage of existing authentication infrastructure and
processes.

Setting up and configuring a Kerberos deployment is beyond the scope
of this document. In order to use MongoDB with Kerberos, you must
have a properly configured Kerberos deployment and the ability to
generate a valid *keytab* file for each :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance in
your MongoDB deployment.

.. note::

   The following assumes that you have a valid Kerberos keytab file
   for your realm accessible on your system. The examples below assume
   that the keytab file is valid and is located at
   ``/opt/mongodb/mongod.keytab`` and is *only* accessible to the user
   that runs the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process.

Process Overview
----------------

To run MongoDB with Kerberos support, you must:

- Configure a Kerberos service principal for each :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance in your MongoDB deployment.

- Generate and distribute keytab files for each MongoDB component
  (i.e. :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`)in your
  deployment. Ensure that you *only* transmit keytab files over secure
  channels.

- Optional. Start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance *without*
  :setting:`auth` and create users inside of MongoDB that you can use
  to bootstrap your deployment.

- Start :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` with the
  ``KRB5_KTNAME`` environment variable as well as a number of required
  run time options.

- If you did not create Kerberos user accounts, you can use the
  :ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>`
  to create users
  at this point until you create the first user on the ``admin``
  database.

- Authenticate clients, including the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell using
  Kerberos.

Operations
----------

.. _kerberos-create-users:

Create Users and Privilege Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For every user that you want to be able to authenticate using Kerberos,
you must create corresponding privilege documents in the
:data:`system.users <<database>.system.users>` collection to provision
access to users. Consider the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     user: "application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET",
     roles: ["read"],
     userSource: "$external"
   }

This grants the Kerberos user principal
``application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET`` read only access to a
database. The :data:`~<database>.system.users.userSource`
``$external`` reference allows :binary:`~bin.mongod` to consult an
external source (i.e. Kerberos) to authenticate this user.

In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell you can pass the :method:`db.addUser()`
a user privilege document to provision access to users, as in the
following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db = db.getSiblingDB("records")
   db.addUser( {
                 "user": "application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET",
                 "roles": [ "read" ],
                 "userSource": "$external"
               } )

These operations grants the Kerberos user
``application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET`` access to the ``records``
database.

To remove access to a user, use the :method:`~db.collection.remove()`
method, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.system.users.remove( { user: "application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET" } )

To modify a user document, use :doc:`update </core/write-operations>`
operations on documents in the :data:`system.users
<<database>.system.users>` collection.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/reference/privilege-documents` and
   :doc:`/reference/user-privileges`.

Start ``mongod`` with Kerberos Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have provisioned privileges to users in the
:binary:`~bin.mongod`, *and* obtained a valid keytab file, you must start
:binary:`~bin.mongod` using a command in the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=<path to keytab file> <mongod invocation>

For successful operation with :binary:`~bin.mongod` use the following run
time options in addition to your normal default configuration options:

- :option:`--setParameter <mongod --setParameter>` with the
  ``authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI`` argument to enable support for
  Kerberos.

- :option:`--auth <mongod --auth>` to enable authentication.

- :option:`--keyFile <mongod --keyFile>` to allow components of a
  single MongoDB deployment to communicate with each other, if needed
  to support replica set and sharded cluster
  operations. :setting:`keyFile` implies :setting:`auth`.

For example, consider the following invocation:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=/opt/mongodb/mongod.keytab \
       /opt/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath /opt/mongodb/data \
       --fork --logpath /opt/mongodb/log/mongod.log \
       --auth --setParameter authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI

You can also specify these options using the configuration
file. As in the following:

.. code-block:: none

   # /opt/mongodb/mongod.conf, Example configuration file.

   fork = true
   auth = true

   dbpath = /opt/mongodb/data
   logpath = /opt/mongodb/log/mongod.log
   setParameter = authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI

To use this configuration file, start :binary:`~bin.mongod` as in the
following:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=/opt/mongodb/mongod.keytab \
       /opt/mongodb/bin/mongod --config /opt/mongodb/mongod.conf

To start a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance using Kerberos, you must create
a Kerberos service principal and deploy a keytab file for this
instance, and then start the :binary:`~bin.mongos` with the following
invocation:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=/opt/mongodb/mongos.keytab \
       /opt/mongodb/bin/mongos
       --configdb shard0.example.net,shard1.example.net,shard2.example.net \
       --setParameter authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI \
       --keyFile /opt/mongodb/mongos.keyfile

.. tip:: If you installed MongoDB Enterprise using one of the official
   ``.deb`` or ``.rpm`` packages *and* are controlling the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance using the included init/upstart scripts,
   you can set the ``KR5_KTNAME`` variable in the default environment
   settings file. For ``.rpm`` packages this file is located at
   ``/etc/sysconfig/mongod``. For ``.deb`` packages, this file is
   ``/etc/default/mongodb``. Set the value in a line that resembles
   the following:

   .. 2.5.3 -- both default files become mongodb

   .. code-block:: sh

      export KRB5_KTNAME="<setting>"

If you encounter problems when trying to start :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
:binary:`~bin.mongos`, please see the :ref:`troubleshooting section
<kerberos-troubleshooting>` for more information.

.. important:: Before users can authenticate to MongoDB using Kerberos
   you must :ref:`create users <kerberos-create-users>` and grant them
   privileges within MongoDB. If you have not created users when you
   start MongoDB with Kerberos you can use the :ref:`localhost
   authentication exception <localhost-exception>` to add users. See
   the :ref:`kerberos-create-users` section and the
   :doc:`/reference/user-privileges` document for more information.

Authenticate ``mongo`` Shell with Kerberos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance using the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell you must begin by using the ``kinit`` program to initialize and
authenticate a Kerberos session. Then, start a :binary:`~bin.mongo`
instance, and use the :method:`db.auth()` method, to authenticate
against the special ``$external`` database, as in the following
operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use $external
   db.auth( { mechanism: "GSSAPI", user: "application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET" } )

Alternately, you can authenticate using command line options to
:binary:`~bin.mongo`, as in the following equivalent example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --authenticationMechanism=GSSAPI
         --authenticationDatabase='$external' \
         --username application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET

These operations authenticate the Kerberos principal name
``application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET`` to the connected
:binary:`~bin.mongod`, and will automatically acquire all available
privileges as needed.

.. _kerberos-and-drivers:

Use MongoDB Drivers to Authenticate with Kerberos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the time of release, the C++, Java, C#, and Python drivers all
provide support for Kerberos authentication to MongoDB. Consider the
following tutorials for more information:

- :ecosystem:`Authenticate to MongoDB with the Java Driver </tutorial/authenticate-with-java-driver/>`
- :ecosystem:`Authenticate to MongoDB with the C# Driver </tutorial/authenticate-with-csharp-driver/>`
- :ecosystem:`Authenticate to MongoDB with the C++ Driver </tutorial/authenticate-with-cpp-driver/>`
- `Python Authentication Examples <http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/examples/authentication.html>`_

Kerberos and the HTTP Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB does not support kerberizing the :ecosystem:`HTTP Console
</tools/http-interface/#http-console>`.

.. _kerberos-troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting
---------------

.. _kerberos-troubleshooting-checklist:

Kerberos Configuration Checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're having trouble getting :binary:`~bin.mongod` to start with
Kerberos, there are a number of Kerberos-specific issues that can
prevent successful authentication. As you begin troubleshooting
your Kerberos deployment, ensure that:

- The :binary:`~bin.mongod` is from MongoDB Enterprise.

- You are not using the :ecosystem:`HTTP Console
  </tools/http-interface/#http-console>`. MongoDB Enterprise
  does not support Kerberos authentication over the HTTP Console
  interface.

- You have a valid keytab file specified in the
  environment running the :binary:`~bin.mongod`. For the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  instance running on the ``db0.example.net`` host, the service
  principal should be ``mongodb/db0.example.net``.

- DNS allows the :binary:`~bin.mongod` to resolve the components of the
  Kerberos infrastructure. You should have both ``A`` and ``PTR``
  records (i.e. forward and reverse DNS) for the system that runs
  the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

- The canonical system hostname of the system that runs the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is the resolvable fully qualified
  domain for this host. Test system hostname resolution with the
  ``hostname -f`` command at the system prompt.

- Both the Kerberos *KDC* and the system running :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  instance must be able to resolve each other using DNS [#krb5-conf]_

- The time systems of the systems running the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  instances and the Kerberos infrastructure are synchronized. Time
  differences greater than 5 minutes will prevent successful
  authentication.

.. coming soon: error messages and their approximate meaning

If you still encounter problems with Kerberos, you can start both
:binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongo` (or another client) with the
environment variable ``KRB5_TRACE`` set to different files to produce
more verbose logging of the Kerberos process to help further
troubleshooting, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=/opt/mongodb/mongod.keytab \
       KRB5_TRACE=/opt/mongodb/log/mongodb-kerberos.log \
       /opt/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath /opt/mongodb/data \
       --fork --logpath /opt/mongodb/log/mongod.log \
       --auth --setParameter authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI

.. [#krb5-conf] By default, Kerberos attempts to resolve hosts using
   the content of the ``/etc/krb5.conf`` before using DNS to resolve
   hosts.

Common Error Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some situations, MongoDB will return error messages from the GSSAPI
interface if there is a problem with the Kerberos service.

``GSSAPI error in client while negotiating security context.``
  This error occurs on the client and reflects insufficient credentials
  or a malicious attempt to authenticate.

  If you receive this error ensure that you're using the correct
  credentials and the correct fully qualified domain name when
  connecting to the host.

``GSSAPI error acquiring credentials.``
  This error only occurs when attempting to start the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  or :binary:`~bin.mongos` and reflects improper configuration of system
  hostname or a missing or incorrectly configured keytab file. If you
  encounter this problem, consider all the items in the
  :ref:`kerberos-troubleshooting-checklist`, in particular:

  - examine the keytab file, with the following command:

    .. code-block:: sh

       klist -k <keytab>

    Replace ``<keytab>`` with the path to your keytab file.

  - check the configured hostname for your system, with the following
    command:

    .. code-block:: sh

       hostname -f

    Ensure that this name matches the name in the keytab file, or use
    the :parameter:`saslHostName` to pass MongoDB the correct hostname.

Enable the Traditional MongoDB Authentication Mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For testing and development purposes you can enable both the Kerberos
(i.e. ``GSSAPI``) authentication mechanism in combination with the
traditional MongoDB challenge/response authentication mechanism
(i.e. ``MONGODB-CR``), using the following :setting:`setParameter`
run-time option:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --setParameter authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI,MONGODB-CR

.. warning::

   All :setting:`keyFile` *internal* authentication between members of
   a :term:`replica set` or :term:`sharded cluster` still uses the
   ``MONGODB-CR`` authentication mechanism, even if ``MONGODB-CR`` is
   not enabled. All client authentication will still use Kerberos.
