Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to configure **network compression** for
your connection to MongoDB.

Network compression is a feature that allows you to compress and
decompress messages sent between your application and MongoDB, reducing
the total amount of data passed over the network.

The {+library-short+} supports the following compressors:

1. `Snappy <https://google.github.io/snappy/>`__
#. `Zlib <https://zlib.net/>`__
#. `Zstandard <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/>`__

.. note:: Compressor Selection

   If you specify multiple compressors to use on your connection, the
   driver selects the first one that is supported by the MongoDB
   deployment that the {+library-short+} is connected to.

.. _php-enable-compression:

Enable Network Compression
--------------------------

To enable compression for the connection to your MongoDB deployment, use the
``compressors`` connection option and specify the compression algorithms you want to use.
You can do this in two ways:

- Pass the algorithms as an argument to the ``MongoDB\Client`` constructor.
- Specify the algorithms in your connection string.

The following example shows how to specify Snappy, Zlib, and
Zstandard as the compressors for a connection. Select the :guilabel:`MongoDB\\Client`
or :guilabel:`Connection URI` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/network-compression.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-enable-client
         :end-before: end-enable-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/network-compression.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-enable-uri
         :end-before: end-enable-uri

Specify the zlib Compression Level
----------------------------------

If you specify ``zlib`` as one of your compression algorithms, you can also use the
``zlibCompressionLevel`` option to specify a compression level. This option accepts
an integer value between ``-1`` and ``9``:

- **-1:** (Default). zlib uses its default compression level (usually ``6``).
- **0:** No compression.
- **1:** Fastest speed but lowest compression.
- **9:** Best compression but slowest speed.

The following example specifies the ``zlib`` compression algorithm and a
``zlibCompressionLevel`` value of ``1``. Select the :guilabel:`MongoDB\\Client`
or :guilabel:`Connection URI` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/network-compression.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-set-level-client
         :end-before: end-set-level-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/network-compression.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-set-level-uri
         :end-before: end-set-level-uri

API Documentation
-----------------

To learn more about the ``MongoDB\Client`` class, see :phpclass:`MongoDB\Client` 
in the library API documentation.

To view a full list of URI options that you can pass to a ``MongoDB\Client``, see the
