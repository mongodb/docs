  If you have a :ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <backup-compliance-policy>` and 
  you terminate a {+cluster+}, |service| automatically maintains all 
  existing snapshots after the termination according to the backup 
  policy. |service| retains the :term:`oplog` for 
  :ref:`restoring a point in time with {+pit-restore+} 
  <recover-pit-continuous-cloud-backup>` in a static state until 
  |service| can no longer use them for {+pit-restore+}.

  Otherwise, if you have {+Cloud-Backup+} enabled, you can toggle 
  :guilabel:`Keep existing snapshots after termination` to 
  :guilabel:`On`.

  If you have {+Cloud-Backup+} disabled, this option is unavilable.
