The aggregation pipeline supports operations on :term:`sharded
<sharded cluster>` collections. This section describes behaviors
specific to the :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` and
sharded collections.

Behavior
--------

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

If the pipeline starts with an exact :pipeline:`$match` on a shard key,
the entire pipeline runs on the matching shard only. Previously, the
pipeline would have been split, and the work of merging it would have
to be done on the primary shard.

For aggregation operations that must run on multiple shards, if the
operations do not require running on the database's primary shard,
these operations will route the results to a random shard to merge the
results to avoid overloading the primary shard for that database. The
:pipeline:`$out` stage,:pipeline:`$facet` stage and the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage
require running on the database's primary shard.

Optimization
------------

When splitting the aggregation pipeline into two parts, the pipeline is
split to ensure that the shards perform as many stages as possible with
consideration for optimization.

To see how the pipeline was split, include the :method:`explain
<db.collection.aggregate()>` option in the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method.
