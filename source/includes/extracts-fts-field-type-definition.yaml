ref: fts-ib-enable-dynamic-mappings
content: | 
  If you enable :ref:`dynamic mappings <static-dynamic-mappings>`, |fts| 
  automatically indexes fields of type |fts-field-type|. You can
  use the **Visual Editor** or the  **JSON Editor** in the {+atlas-ui+} to 
  index fields as the |fts-field-type| type. 

--- 
ref: fts-ib-static-mappings
content: | 
  |fts| doesn't :ref:`dynamically <static-dynamic-mappings>` index
  fields of type |fts-field-type|. You *must* use :ref:`static mappings
  <static-dynamic-mappings>` to index |fts-field-type| fields. You can
  use the **Visual Editor** or the  **JSON Editor** in the {+atlas-ui+}
  to index fields of type |fts-field-type|.

ref: fts-ib-static-mappings-for-facet
content: | 
  |fts| only supports :ref:`fts-facet-ref` queries against fields
  indexed as the |fts-field-type| type. To perform a normal search also
  on the same field, you must index the field as type |data-type| also.

  To facet on string fields in embedded documents, you must index the
  parent fields as the :ref:`document <bson-data-types-document>` type.
  When you facet on a string field inside embedded documents, |fts|
  returns facet count for only the number of matching parent documents. 

  |fts| doesn't :ref:`dynamically <static-dynamic-mappings>` index
  |data-type| values for faceting. You must use :ref:`static
  mappings <static-dynamic-mappings>` to index |data-type| values for
  faceting. You can use the **Visual Editor** or the  **JSON Editor** in
  the {+atlas-ui+} to index |data-type| fields as the ``numberFacet`` type.
