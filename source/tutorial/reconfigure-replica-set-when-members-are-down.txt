===============================================
Reconfigure a Replica Set when Members are Down
===============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To reconfigure a :term:`replica set` when a **majority** of members
are accessible, use the :method:`rs.reconfig()` operation on
the current :term:`primary`, following the example in the
:ref:`Replica Set Reconfiguration Procedure
<replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`.

To reconfigure a replica set when a **minority** of members are
accessible, the reconfiguration process is less straightforward. Use
the procedure in this document, to reconfigure a replica set in this
situation. For example, you will need to use this process to
reconfigure a set split between multiple facilities where *no* local
group of nodes can reach a majority. See
:ref:`replica-set-elections-and-network-partitions` for more
information about these case. In these situations, *always* use the
procedures described in this document.

.. index:: replica set; reconfiguration
.. _replica-set-force-reconfiguration:

Reconfigure by Forcing the Reconfiguration
------------------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 2.0

This procedure lets you recover while a majority of :term:`replica set`
members are down or unreachable. You connect to any surviving member and
use the ``force`` option to the :method:`rs.reconfig()`  method to force a
reconfiguration of the replica set.

The ``force`` option reconfigures the set. The option is intended only
for serious problems, such as a disaster recovery failover. Do not use
``force`` every time you reconfigure. Also, do not use ``force`` in any
automatic scripts and do not use ``force`` when there is still a
primary.

To force reconfiguration:

1. Back up a surviving member.

#. Connect to a surviving member and save the current configuration.
   Consider the following example commands for saving the configuration:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg = rs.config()

      printjson(cfg)

#. On the same member, remove the down and unreachable members of the
   replica set from the :data:`members <rs.conf.members>` array by
   setting the array equal to the surviving members alone. Consider the
   following example, which uses the ``cfg`` variable created in the
   previous step:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg.members = [cfg.members[0] , cfg.members[4] , cfg.members[7]]

#. On the same member, reconfigure the set by using the
   :method:`rs.reconfig()` command with the ``force`` option set to
   ``true``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.reconfig(cfg, {force : true})

   The replica set elects a new primary, most likely the member you are
   connected to.

   .. note:: When you use ``force : true``, the version number in the
      replica set configuration increases significantly, by tens or
      hundreds of thousands. This is normal and designed to prevent set
      version collisions if network partitioning ends.

#. If the failure or partition was only temporary, shut down or
   decommission the removed members as soon as possible.

Reconfigure by Replacing the Replica Set
----------------------------------------

The procedures here are intended mainly for MongoDB versions *prior to*
version 2.0. For post-2.0 version, the above procedure,
:ref:`replica-set-force-reconfiguration`, is recommended.

These procedures are for situations where a *majority* of the
:term:`replica set` members are down or unreachable. If a majority is
*running*, then skip these procedures and instead use the
:method:`rs.reconfig()` command according to the examples in
:ref:`replica-set-reconfiguration-usage`.

If you run a pre-2.0 version and a majority of your replica set is down,
you have the two options described here. Both involve replacing the
replica set.

Reconfigure by Turning Off Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option replaces the :term:`replica set` with a :term:`standalone` server.

1. Stop the surviving :program:`mongod` instances.

#. Perform a backup.

#. Move each surviving member's data directory to an archive folder. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mv /data/db /data/db-old

   .. optional:: You may remove the data instead.

#. Restart one of the :program:`mongod` instances *without* the
   ``--replSet`` parameter.

   You are back online with a single server that is not a replica set
   member. Clients can use this server for both reads and writes.

Reconfigure by "Breaking the Mirror"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option selects a surviving :term:`replica set` member to be the new
:term:`primary` and to be the "seed" for a new replica set. All other
members must resync from this new primary.

1. Stop the surviving :program:`mongod` instances.

#. Perform a backup.

#. Move each surviving member's data directory to an archive folder. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mv /data/db /data/db-old

   .. optional:: You may remove the data instead.

#. Restart all :program:`mongod` instances with the new replica set name.

#. On the new primary, add the other instances as members of the replica
   set. For more information, see :doc:`/tutorial/expand-replica-set`.
