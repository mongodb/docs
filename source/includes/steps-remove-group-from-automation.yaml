title: "Verify the Automation Agent version."
stepnum: 1
ref: verify-automation-agent-version
content: |

   Verify the *package* version for your Automation Agent is 2.7.1 or
   later.

   .. note::

      This version is *not* shown in |mms|. You must check the version
      of the Automation Agent *package* on the server.

      On a Microsoft Windows server, the filename for the Automation
      Agent package looks like:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongodb-mms-automation-agent-2.8.1.1725-1.windows_x86_64.msi

      The package version is ``2.8.1.1725-1``.
