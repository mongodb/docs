   Server Pool
   -----------

   .. include:: /includes/fact-server-pools-deprecated.rst

   |onprem| Server Pool allows |onprem| users with administrative
   privileges, i.e. |onprem| Administrators, to maintain a pool of
   provisioned servers that already have {+aagent+}s installed.
   When users in a project want to create a new MongoDB deployment,
   they can request servers from this pool to host the MongoDB
   deployment.

   For details, see :ref:`provision-via-server-pool`.

   .. note::
      Ensure that the properties file contains the desired property names
      and values *before* starting the {+aagent+} on the server.

      Once the server is registered with the pool, changes to the
      properties file do not take effect until the server is *first*
      removed and the {+aagent+} restarted.

   The properties and the values in this file may be presented to the
   user during server request as options when a user requests servers
   from the server pool. That is, the user can request servers that
   match certain properties.

   The |onprem| Administrator determines which properties to display to
   the user in the server request screen. For details, see
   :ref:`server-pool-server-request-options`.
