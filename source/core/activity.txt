Overview
--------

MMS provides event tracking. The :guilabel:`Activity` tab displays a feed
of all events tracked by MMS, including alerts.

View All Events
---------------

To view all events, click the :guilabel:`Activity` tab and then select
:guilabel:`All Activity`. The :guilabel:`All Activity` page displays an
activity feed of all events tracked by MMS. If you have open alerts, the
page displays them above the feed.

The events tracked by MMS include:

- Events generated by users through interaction with the user interface,
  such as adding a host, changing a user's role, or starting a backup.

- Events generated in the monitored environment, such as restarting a host
  or electing a new primary in a replica set.

- Events generated internally by the system, such as opening an alert or
  deactivating a host.
