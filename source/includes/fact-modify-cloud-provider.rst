You can only modify the cloud provider backing your cluster
when you upgrade from an |service| ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5`` Shared
Tier cluster to a larger cluster. Transitioning to a different provider
changes your cluster connection string. Consider scheduling a
maintenance window to update your applications with the new connection
string to resume connectivity to the cluster. |service| migrates data to
the new cluster.
