Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/choice-update-mongodb-agent-monitoring.rst

Next Steps

After the {+mdbagent+} update completes:

- If Automation did not previously manage your Monitoring Agent,
  activate :ref:`{+bagent+} <activate-backup>` and/or
  :ref:`{+magent+} <activate-monitoring>` on your MongoDB deployment.

- If Automation did previously manage your Monitoring
  Agent, it is now activated. To verify that {+aagent+}
  is activated:

  .. procedure::
     :style: normal

     .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-deployment.rst

     .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-servers.rst

- If you want to activate {+aagent+},
  :ref:`add a deployment <activate-automation>` to your MongoDB
  project.

- :ref:`Stop <stop-monitoring-agent>` and
  :doc:`remove </tutorial/delete-monitoring-agent>` the legacy
  Monitoring Agent.

- :ref:`Stop <stop-backup-agent>` and
