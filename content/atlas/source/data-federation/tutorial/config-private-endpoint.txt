Set Up a Private Endpoint for a {+FDI+} 
===========================================================

MongoDB supports |aws| and |azure| private endpoints for your {+fdi+}. You 
can set up the private endpoints from the {+atlas-cli+}, {+atlas-ui+}, and 
and {+atlas-admin-api+}.

.. note:: 

   You can't use your |service| cluster :ref:`private endpoint ID
   <private-endpoint>` for {+adf+}. The {+adf+} endpoint ID must be
   different from your |service| cluster endpoint ID, if you have one. 

Required Access
---------------

To set up a private endpoint, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project.
Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves as a ``Project Owner``
to the project before setting up a private endpoint.

Prerequisites 
-------------

The procedure differs depending on whether you use |aws| or |azure| for your cloud provider.
Select the appropriate tab:

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: AWS
      :tabid: aws

      1. Have an |aws| user account with an |iam| user policy that grants 
         permissions to create, modify, describe, and delete endpoints. To 
         learn more about controlling the use of interface endpoints, see 
         the :aws:`AWS Documentation 
         </vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html>`.

      #. :aws:`Install the AWS CLI 
         </cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html>`.

      #. If you have not already done so, create your |vpc| and EC2 instances 
         in |aws|. To learn more, see the :aws:`AWS documentation 
         </index.html>` for guidance.

   .. tab:: Azure
      :tabid: azure

      1. Have an |azure| user account with 
         permissions to create resources like virtual networks and private endpoints.
         To learn more about the permissions required, see 
         the `Azure Documentation 
         <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/rbac-permissions>`__.

      #. `Install the Azure CLI <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli>`__.

      .. important:: 

         With |azure|, you can create *up to three private endpoints per project* 
         for your {+fdi+}\s due to an |azure|-imposed limit. This is why |service| 
         prevents you from deleting an |service| project before first deleting its 
         private endpoints. To request more than three private endpoints for a project, 
         contact :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>`.

Procedure
---------

.. tabs::
 
   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli
 
      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-dataFederation-privateEndpoints-create.rst
 
   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api
 
      To configure a private endpoint from the API, send a ``POST`` request 
      with the private endpoint ID to the ``privateNetworkSettings`` 
      endpoint. 

      - If the endpoint ID already exists and there is no change to 
        the comment associated with the endpoint, |service| makes no change 
        to the endpoint ID list.
      - If the endpoint ID already exists and there is a change to the 
        associated comment, |service| updates the ``comment`` value only in 
        the endpoint ID list.
      - If the endpoint ID doesn't exist, |service| appends the new endpoint 
        to the list of endpoints in the endpoint ID list.

      To learn more about the syntax and options, see :oas-bump-atlas-op:`API 
      <creategroupdatafederationprivateendpoint>`.
 
   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui
 
      To set up a private endpoint for your {+fdi+} using the {+atlas-ui+}, follow these steps:

      .. tabs::
         :hidden: true 

         .. tab:: AWS
            :tabid: aws
      
            .. tabs:: 

               .. tab:: Create New Endpoint 
                  :tabid: create-new 

                  .. include:: /includes/steps-adf-create-new-privatelink.rst

               .. tab:: Add Existing Endpoint 
                  :tabid: add-existing

                  .. include:: /includes/steps-adf-add-existing-privatelink.rst 

         .. tab:: Azure
            :tabid: azure

            .. include:: /includes/steps-adf-create-privatelink-azure.rst

To verify whether the private endpoint setup is successful:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-network-access.rst

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` tab.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Federated Database Instance / Online Archive` tab.

   .. step:: Review the details.

       Review the :guilabel:`Cloud Provider`, :guilabel:`Region`, :guilabel:`Endpoint Status`, :guilabel:`VPC ID / Virtual Network Name` and :guilabel:`Description`.
