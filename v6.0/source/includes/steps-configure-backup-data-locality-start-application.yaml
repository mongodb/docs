  The ``gen.key`` file is located in ``/etc/mongodb-mms/`` for
  installations from a package manager and in ``${HOME}/.mongodb-mms/``
  for installations from an archive.

  Copy the ``gen.key`` file from the |application| server in Data Center 1
  to the appropriate directory on the |application| server in Data Center
  2 and on each Backup Daemon server.

  For example, if you installed from  an ``rpm`` or ``deb`` package,
  copy ``/etc/mongodb-mms/gen.key`` from the |application| server in
  Data Center 1 to the:

  - ``/etc/mongodb-mms`` directory on the |application| server in Data Center 2.

  - ``/etc/mongodb-mms`` directory of each Backup Daemon server in each data center.
