Overview

In this guide, you can learn about how the {+driver-short+} manages server
settings.

Configuring Server Settings
---------------------------

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Connection String
    :tabid: uri

    Include the following parameters in your connection string to modify the
    driver's behavior when interacting with the server:

    .. list-table:: 
       :header-rows: 1 
       :widths: 25,20,60

       * - Option Name
         - Type
         - Description

       * - ``appName``
         - string
         - Specifies the name of the application provided to MongoDB instances
           during the connection handshake. Can be used for server logs and
           profiling. 
           
           *Default*: ``null``

       * - ``serverMonitoringMode``
         - string
         - Specifies which server monitoring protocol the driver uses. When set
           to ``auto``, the monitoring mode is determined by the environment in
           which the driver is running. The driver uses ``poll`` mode in
           function-as-a-service (FaaS) environments and ``stream`` mode in
           other environments.
           
           *Default*: ``auto``
        
       * - ``heartbeatFrequencyMS``
         - integer
         - Specifies the frequency, in milliseconds that the driver will wait
           between attempts to determine the current state of each server in
           the cluster.   
           
           *Default*: ``10000`` (10 seconds)
        

    This example specifies that the cluster monitor will attempt to reach a
    server every 15 seconds: 
    
    .. code-block:: java

      ConnectionString connectionString = "mongodb://<host>:<port>/?heartbeatFrequencyMS=15000"
      MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(connectionString)
    
    For more information about these parameters, see the `ConnectionString
    <{+core-api+}/ConnectionString.html>`__
    API documentation.


  .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
    :tabid: MongoClient
    
    Chain the `applyToServerSettings() <{+core-api+}/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToServerSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__ method to modify the driver's behavior when monitoring each MongoDB deployment. 

    The following table describes the methods you can chain to your settings to modify the driver's behavior:

    .. list-table::
      :widths: 40 60
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Method
        - Description

      * - ``addServerListener()``
        - Adds a listener for server-related events.

      * - ``addServerMonitorListener()``
        - Adds a listener for server monitor-related events.

      * - ``applySettings()``
        - Uses the server settings specified in a ``ServerSettings`` object.

      * - ``heartbeatFrequency()``
        - Sets the interval for a cluster monitor to attempt reaching a server.
       
          *Default*: ``10 seconds``

      * - ``minHeartbeatFrequency()``
        - Sets the minimum interval for server monitoring checks.
       
          *Default*: ``500 milliseconds``

    This example specifies the following driver behavior in a MongoDB deployment:

    - The minimum interval for server monitoring checks to be at least
      ``700 MILLISECONDS``
    - The cluster monitor to attempt reaching a server every ``15 SECONDS``

    .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MCSettings.java
       :start-after: begin ServerSettings
       :end-before: end ServerSettings
       :language: java
       :emphasize-lines: 3-5
       :dedent:

    <{+core-api+}/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html>`__
    API documentation.
