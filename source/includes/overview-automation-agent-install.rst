The Automation Agent runs on every host that runs a monitored MongoDB
deployment. The agent provides the interface for starting and managing
deployments. If you run MongoDB on hardware that you provision, you must
install the Automation Agent manually on each server. If you run MongoDB
through the |mms| integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), |mms|
automatically deploys the Automation Agents every time you provision an
new EC2 instance.
