==================================
Configure Monitoring Agent for SSL
==================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

|mms| supports SSL for encrypting the following connections made by
Monitoring Agents:

- Connections between the Monitoring Agents and MongoDB instances.

- Connections between the Monitoring Agents and |mms| servers.

Connections between Agents and MongoDB Instances
------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/monitoring-agent-configure-ssl.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-ssl-host-settings.rst

Connections between Agents and MMS Servers
------------------------------------------

.. only:: saas

   The Monitoring Agents always use SSL when connecting to the
   |MMS| servers.

.. only:: hosted

   To ensure that the Monitoring Agents use SSL when connecting
   to the |MMS| servers, use an HTTPS proxy in front of |MMS|.

   SSL Certificate Validation
   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   Starting with |MMS| 1.4, the Monitoring Agent validates the SSL
   certificate of the MMS server by default.

   If you are not using a certificate signed by a trusted 3rd party,
   you must configure the Monitoring Agent to trust the MMS server.

   To specify a self-signed certificate of the MMS server that the
   Monitoring Agent should trust:

   .. include:: /includes/steps/on-prem-monitoring-agent-configure-trust.rst

   Configuration Settings
   ++++++++++++++++++++++

For the settings used by the Monitoring Agent to connect to the |MMS|
servers, see :ref:`server-monitoring-ssl`.
