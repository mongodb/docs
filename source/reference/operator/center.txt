.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $center

   .. versionadded:: 1.4

   The :operator:`$center` operator specifies a circle for a
   :term:`geospatial` :operator:`$geoWithin` query. The query returns
   documents that are within the bounds of the circle, according to
   their point-based location data. The :operator:`$center` operator
   returns documents based on :ref:`grid coordinates
   <geospatial-indexes-store-grid-coordinates>` and does *not* query for
   GeoJSON shapes.

   The query calculates distances using planar geometry. The ``2d``
   geospatial index supports the :operator:`$center` operator.

   To use the :operator:`$center` operator, specify an array that
   contains:

   - The grid coordinates of the circle's center point

   - The circle's radius, as measured in the units used by the
     coordinate system

   .. important:: If you use longitude and latitude, specify **longitude first**.

   Use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { <location field> : { $geoWithin : { $center : [ [ <x>, <y> ] , <radius> ] } } }

   The following example query returns all documents that have
   coordinates that exist within the circle centered on ``[ -74 , 40.74 ]``
   and with a radius of ``10``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.places.find( { loc: { $geoWithin :
                                { $center : [ [-74, 40.74], 10 ] }
                      } } )
