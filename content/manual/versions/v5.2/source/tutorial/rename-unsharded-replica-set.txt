To rename a replica set, you must shut down all members of the replica 
set, then configure each member's ``local`` database with the new 
replica set name.

This procedure requires downtime.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Ensure your replica set is not sharded. The renaming procedure 
  is for unsharded replica sets only. 

- Before renaming a replica set, perform a full
  :doc:`backup of your MongoDB deployment </core/backups>`.
