.. default-domain:: mongodb

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` in MongoDB automate the vast
majority of the administrative complexity typically associated with
database replication and management. Nevertheless, some deployment and
long term administrative requirements that require administrator
intervention. This document provides an overview of these tasks as in
addition to general troubleshooting suggestions.

Procedures
----------

.. _replica-set-admin-procedure-add-member:

Adding Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From time to time, you may need to add an additional member to an existing
:term:`replica set`. The data directory for the new member can:

- have no data. In this case, MongoDB must copy all data as part of
  the replication process before the member can exit
  ":term:`recovering`" status, and become a :term:`secondary`
  member. This process can be time intensive, but does not require
  administrator intervention.

- copy the :term:`data directory <dbpath>` from an existing member. The new member
  becomes a secondary, and will catch up to the current state of the
  replica set after a short interval. Copying the data over manually,
  shortens the amount of time it takes for the new member to become
  current.

  If the difference in the amount of time between the most recent
  operation and the most recent operation to the database exceeds the
  length of the :term:`oplog` on the existing members, then the new
  instance will have to completely re-synchronize. Ensure that you can
  copy the data to the new system and begin replication within the
  window allowed by the :term:`oplog`.

  Use :func:`db.printReplicationInfo()` to check the current state of
  replica set members with regards to the oplog.

To add a member to an existing :term:`replica set`, deploy a new
:program:`mongod` instance, specifying the name of the replica set
(i.e. "setname" or ``replSet``) on the command line with the
:option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option or in the configuration
file with the :setting:`replSet`. Take note of the host name and port
information for the new :program:`mongod` instance.

Then, log in to the current primary using the :program:`mongo`
shell. Issue the :func:`db.isMaster()` command when connected to *any*
member of the set to determine the current :term:`primary`. Issue the
following command to add the new member to the set:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.add("mongo2.example.net:27017")

Alternately, specify an entire configuration document with some or all
of the fields in a :data:`members <rs.conf.members>` document, for
example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.add({_id: 1, host: "mongo2.example.net:27017", priority: 0, hidden: true})

This configures a :term:`hidden member` that is accessible at
``mongo2.example.net:27017``. See ":data:`host <members[n].host>`,"
":data:`priority <members[n].priority>`," and ":data:`hidden
<members[n].hidden>`" for more information about these settings. When
you specify a full configuration object with :func:`rs.add()`, you must
declare the ``_id`` field, which is not automatically populated in
this case.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/expand-replica-set`

.. _replica-set-admin-procedure-remove-members:

Removing Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may remove a member of a replica at any time, if needed. Use the
:func:`rs.remove()` function in the :program:`mongo` shell while
connected to the current :term:`primary`. Issue the
:func:`db.isMaster()` command when connected to *any* member of the
set to determine the current :term:`primary`. Use a command in either
of the following forms to remove the member:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.remove("mongo2.example.net:27017")
   rs.remove("mongo3.example.net")

This operation disconnects the shell briefly and forces a
re-connection as the :term:`replica set` renegotiates which member
will be :term:`primary`. The shell will display an error even if this
command succeeds.

You can re-add a removed member to a replica set at any time using the
:ref:`procedure for adding replica set members
<replica-set-admin-procedure-add-member>`. Additionally, consider
using the :ref:`replica set reconfiguration procedure
<replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>` to change the
:data:`members[n].host` value to rename a host in a replica set
directly.

.. _replica-set-admin-procedure-replace-member:

Replacing a Member
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two processes for replacing a member of a replica set:

#. Remove and then re-add a member using the following procedure in
   the :program:`mongo` shell:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.remove("mongo2.example.net:27018")
      rs.add({host: "mongo2.example.net:27019", priority: 0, hidden: true})

   .. note::

      Because the set member tracks its own replica set member ``_id``
      which can cause conflicts when trying to re-add a previous member.

      To resolve this issue, you can either restart the
      :program:`mongod` process on the host that you're re-adding, or
      make sure that you specify an ``_id`` in the :func:`rs.add()`
      document.

#. Use :func:`rs.reconfig()` to change the value of the
   :data:`members[n].host` field to reflect the new hostname or port
   number. In this case, the :data:`members[n]._id` field is not
   reused by the new member.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg = rs.conf()
      cfg.members[0].host = "mongo2.example.net:27019"
      rs.reconfig(cfg)

   The second method may be useful if you have an existing configuration
   and only want to change the hostname of a member rather than
   completely remove all configuration related to the existing/previous
   set member. The :data:`members[n]._id` field does not change as a
   result of this operation.

.. warning::

   Any replica set configuration change can trigger the current
   :term:`primary` to step down forcing an :term:`election`. This
   causes the current shell session to produce an error even when the
   operation succeeds. Clients connected to this replica set will also
   disconnect.

.. _replica-set-node-priority-configuration:

Adjusting a Member's Priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change the value of the :data:`members[n].priority` value in the
replica set configuration, use the following sequence of commands in
the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0.5
   cfg.members[1].priority = 2
   cfg.members[2].priority = 2
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

The first operation sets the local variable ``cfg`` to the contents
of the current replica set configuration using the :func:`rs.conf()`,
which is a :term:`document`. The next three operations change the
:data:`members[n].priority` value in the ``cfg`` document for
:data:`members[n]._id` of ``0``, ``1``, or ``2``. The final operation
calls :func:`rs.reconfig()` with the argument of ``cfg`` to initialize
the new configuration.

If a node has :data:`members[n].priority` set to ``0``, it is
ineligible to become primary, and will not seek
elections. :ref:`Hidden <replica-set-hidden-members>` and
:ref:`delayed <replica-set-delayed-members>` members and
:ref:`arbiters <replica-set-arbiters>` have priority set to
``0``. Unless configured, all nodes have a :data:`members[n].priority`
setting equal to ``1``.

.. note::

   The value of :data:`members[n].priority` can be any floating point
   (i.e. decimal) number between ``0`` and ``1000``, and priorities
   are only used to determine the preference in election. The priority
   value is only used in with other instances. With the exception of
   nodes with a priority of ``0``, the absolute value of the
   :data:`members[n].priority` value is irrelevant.

Replica sets will preferentially elect and maintain the primary status
of the node with the highest :data:`members[n].priority` setting.

.. warning::

   Replica set reconfiguration can force the current primary to step
   down, leading to an election for primary in the replica
   set. Elections cause the current primary to close all open
   :term:`client` connections.

   Perform routine replica set reconfiguration during scheduled
   maintenance windows.

.. seealso:: The ":ref:`Replica Reconfiguration Usage
   <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`" example revolves around
   changing the priorities of the :data:`members` of a replica set.

.. _replica-set-procedure-change-oplog-size:

Changing the Oplog Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`oplog` exists internally as a :term:`capped collection`, so
you cannot modify its size in the course of normal operations. In most
cases the :ref:`default oplog size <replica-set-oplog-sizing>` is an
acceptable size; however, in some situations you may need a larger or
smaller oplog. To resize the oplog, follow these steps:

1. Restart the current :term:`primary` instance in the replica set in
   "standalone" mode, running on a different port.

2. Save the last entry from the old (current) oplog, and create a
   backup of the old (current) oplog.

3. Drop the current oplog, and create a new oplog of a different size.

4. Insert the previously saved last entry from the old oplog into the
   new (current) oplog.

5. Restart the server as a member of the replica set on its usual
   port.

6. Apply this procedure to any other member of the replica set that
   *could become* :term:`primary`.

.. seealso:: The ":doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size`" tutorial.

.. _replica-set-node-configurations:

Node Configurations
-------------------

All replica sets have a single :term:`primary` node and one or more
:term:`secondary` nodes. Replica sets sets allow you to configure
secondary nodes in a variety of ways. This section describes these
configurations and also describes the arbiter node type.

.. note::

   A replica set can have up to 12 nodes, but only 7 nodes can have
   votes. See ":ref:`non-voting members <replica-set-non-voting-members>`"
   for configuration information regarding non-voting nodes.

.. warning::

   The :func:`rs.reconfig()` shell command can force the current
   primary to step down and causes an election. When the primary node
   steps down, the :program:`mongod` closes all client
   connections. While, this typically takes 10-20 seconds, attempt to
   make these changes during scheduled maintenance periods.

.. _replica-set-secondary-only-configuration:

Secondary-Only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a four-member replica set, with member ``_id`` values of:
``0``, ``1``, ``2``, and ``3`` use the following sequence of
operations in the :program:`mongo` shell to modify node priorities:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0
   cfg.members[1].priority = 0.5
   cfg.members[2].priority = 1
   cfg.members[3].priority = 2
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

This operation sets the following:

- Member ``0`` to a priority of ``0`` so that it can never become primary.

- Member ``1`` to a priority of ``0.5``, which makes it less likely to
  become primary than other members, but doesn't prohibit the
  possibility.

- Member ``2`` to a priority of ``1``, which is the default value, and
  will become primary if no member with a higher priority is eligible
  to be primary.

- Member ``3`` has a priority of ``2`` and will become primary, if
  eligible, under most circumstances.

.. note::

   If your replica set has an even number members, add an
   :ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiters>` to ensure that
   nodes will be able to quickly obtain a majority of votes in an
   :ref:`election <replica-set-elections>` for primary.

.. seealso:: ":data:`members[n].priority`" and ":ref:`Replica Set
   Reconfiguration <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`."

.. _replica-set-hidden-configuration:

Hidden
~~~~~~

To configure a :term:`hidden member`, use the following sequence of
operations in the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0
   cfg.members[0].hidden = true
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

After re-configuring the set, the node with the ``_id`` of ``0``,
has a priority of ``0`` so that it cannot become master, while the
other nodes in the set will not advertise the hidden node in the
:dbcommand:`isMaster` or :func:`db.isMaster()` output.

.. note::

   You must send the :func:`rs.reconfig()` command to a set member
   that *can* become :term:`primary`. In the above example, if you issue
   the :func:`rs.reconfig()` operation to the member with the ``_id``
   of ``0``, the operation will fail.

.. seealso:: ":ref:`Replica Set Read Preference <replica-set-read-preference>`."
   ":data:`members[n].hidden`," ":data:`members[n].priority`,"
   and ":ref:`Replica Set Reconfiguration <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`."

.. _replica-set-delayed-configuration:

Delayed
~~~~~~~

To configure a replica set member with a one hour delay, use the
following sequence of operations in the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0
   cfg.members[0].slaveDelay = 3600
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

After the replica set reconfigures, the set member with the ``_id`` of
``0``, will have a priority of ``0`` so that it cannot become primary and
will delay replication and its :term:`oplog` by 3600 seconds or 1
hour. Setting :data:`slaveDelay <members[n].slaveDelay>` to a
non-zero value will also set :data:`hidden <members[n].hidden>` to
``true`` for this replica set so that it will not receive application
queries in normal operations.

.. warning::

   The length of the secondary :data:`slaveDelay
   <members[n].slaveDelay>` must fit within the window of the
   :term:`oplog`. If the oplog is shorter than the :data:`slaveDelay
   <members[n].slaveDelay>` window the delayed member will not be able
   to successfully replicate operations.

.. related:: For more information about delayed members, see the
   section on ":ref:`Delayed Replication <replica-set-delayed-members>`."
   Additionally consider the following resources:
  ":data:`members[n].slaveDelay`," ":ref:`Replica Set Reconfiguration
  <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`," ":ref:`Oplog Sizing
  <replica-set-oplog-sizing>`," and ":doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size`."

.. _replica-set-arbiter-configuration:

Arbiters
~~~~~~~~

Use the following command to start an arbiter:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --replSet [setname]

Replace ``[setname]`` with the name of the replica set that the
arbiter will join. Then in the :program:`mongo` shell, while connected
to the *current primary* node, issue the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.addArb("[hostname]:[port]")

Replace the ``[hostname]:[port]`` string with the name of the
hostname and port of the arbiter that you wish to add to the set.

.. seealso:: ":setting:`replSet`," ":option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`,
   and ":func:`rs.addArb()`."

.. _replica-set-non-voting-configuration:

Non-Voting
~~~~~~~~~~

To disable a node's ability to vote in :ref:`elections
<replica-set-elections>` use the following command sequence in the
:program:`mongo` shell.

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[3].votes = 0
   cfg.members[4].votes = 0
   cfg.members[5].votes = 0
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

This sequence sets gives ``0`` votes to set members with the ``_id``
values of ``3``, ``4``, and ``5``. This setting allows the set to
elect these members as :term:`primary`, but does not allow them to
vote in elections. If you have three non-voting nodes, you can add
three additional voting nodes to your set. Place voting nodes so that
your designated primary node or nodes can reach a majority of votes in
the event of a network partition.

.. note::

   In general use, when possible all nodes should have only 1 vote to
   prevent intermittent ties, deadlock, or the wrong nodes from
   becoming :term:`primary`. Use ":ref:`Replica Set Priorities
   <replica-set-node-priority>`" to control which nodes are more
   likely to become primary.

.. seealso:: ":data:`members[n].votes`" and ":ref:`Replica Set
   Reconfiguration <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`."

.. _replica-set-security:

Security
--------

In most cases, the most effective ways to control access and secure
the connection between members of a :term:`replica set` depend on
network level access control. Use your environment's firewall and
network routing to ensure that *only* traffic from clients and other
replica set members can reach your :program:`mongod` instances. Use
virtual private networks (VPNs) if needed to ensure secure connections
over wide area networks (WANs.)

Additionally, MongoDB provides an authentication mechanism for
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances connecting to
replica sets. These instances enable authentication but specify a
shared key file that serves as a shared password.

.. versionadded:: 1.8 for replica sets (1.9.1 for sharded replica sets) added support for authentication.

To enable authentication using a key file for the :term:`replica set`,
add the following option to your configuration file.

.. code-block:: cfg

   keyFile = /srv/mongodb/keyfile

.. note::

   You may chose to set these run-time configuration options using the
   :option:`--keyFile <mongod --keyFile>` (or :option:`mongos --keyFile`)
   options on the command line.

Setting :setting:`keyFile` enables authentication and specifies a key
file for the replica set member use to when authenticating to each
other. The content of the key file is arbitrary, but must be the same
on all members of the :term:`replica set` and :program:`mongos`
instances that connect to the set.

The keyfile must be less one kilobyte in size and may only contain
characters in the base64 set and file must not have group or "world"
permissions on UNIX systems. Use the following command to use the
OpenSSL package to generate "random" content for use in a key file:

.. code-block:: bash

   openssl rand -base64 753

.. note::

   Key file permissions are not checked on Windows systems.

Troubleshooting
---------------

This section defines reasonable troubleshooting processes for common
operational challenges. While there is no single causes or guaranteed
response strategies for any of these symptoms, the following sections
provide good places to start a troubleshooting investigation with
:term:`replica sets <replica set>`.

.. seealso:: ":doc:`/administration/monitoring`."

.. _replica-set-replication-lag:

Replication Lag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replication lag is a delay between an operation on the :term:`primary`
and the application of that operation from :term:`oplog` to the
:term:`secondary`. Such lag can be a significant issue, and can
seriously affect MongoDB replica set deployments. Excessive
replication lag makes "lagged" members ineligible to become
:term:`primary` quickly and increases the possibility that distributed
read operations will be inconsistent.

Identify replication lag by checking the values of
:data:`members[n].optimeDate` for each member of the replica set
using the :func:`rs.status()` function in the :program:`mongo`
shell.

Possible causes of replication lag include:

- **Network Latency.**

  Check the network routes between the members of your set, to ensure
  that there is no packet loss or network routing issue.

  Use tools including :command:`ping` to test latency between set
  members and :command:`traceroute` to expose the routing of packets
  network endpoints.

- **Disk Throughput.**

  If the file system and disk device on the :term:`secondary` is
  unable to flush data to disk as quickly as the :term:`primary`, then
  the secondary will have difficulty keeping state. Disk related
  issues are incredibly prevalent on multi-tenant systems, including
  vitalized instances, and can be transient if the system accesses
  disk devices are over an IP network (as is the case with Amazon's
  EBS system.)

  Use system-level tools to assess disk status including
  :command:`iostat` or :command:`vmstat`.

- **Concurrency.**

  In some cases, long running operations on the primary can block
  replication on :term:`secondaries <secondary>`. You can use
  :term:`write concern` to prevent write operations from returning
  unless replication can keep up with the write load.

  Use the :term:`database profiler` to see if there are slow queries
  or long running operations that correspond to the incidences of lag.

Failover and Recovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most cases, failover occurs without administrator intervention
seconds after the :term:`primary` steps down, becomes inaccessible,
or otherwise ineligible to act as primary. If your MongoDB deployment
does not failover according to expectations, consider the following
operational errors:

- No remaining member is able to form a majority. This can happen as a
  result of network partitions that render some members
  inaccessible. Design your deployment to ensure that a majority of
  set members can elect a primary in the same facility as core
  application systems.

- No member is eligible to become :term:`primary`. Members must have a
  :data:`members[n].priority` setting greater than ``0``, have state
  that is less than ten seconds behind the last operation to the
  :term:`replica set`, and generally be *more* up to date than the
  voting members.

In many senses, :ref:`rollbacks <replica-set-rollbacks>` represent a
graceful recovery from an impossible failover and recovery situation.

Rollbacks occur when a primary accepts writes that other members of
the set do not successfully replicate before the primary steps
down. When the former primary begins replicating again it performs a
"rollback." Rollbacks remove those operations from the instance that
were never replicated to the set so that the data set is in a
consistent state. The :program:`mongod` program writes rolled back
data to a :term:`BSON` file that you can view using
:program:`bsondump` apply manually using :program:`mongorestore`.

You can prevent rollbacks prevented by ensuring safe writes by using
the appropriate :term:`write concern`.
