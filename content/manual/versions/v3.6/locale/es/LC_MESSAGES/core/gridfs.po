":term:`GridFS` is a specification for storing and retrieving files that "

#: ../source/core/gridfs.txt:19
msgid ""
"Instead of storing a file in a single document, GridFS divides the file "
"into parts, or chunks [#chunk-disambiguation]_, and stores each chunk as "
"a separate document. By default, GridFS uses a default chunk size of 255 "
"kB; that is, GridFS divides a file into chunks of 255 kB with the "
"exception of the last chunk. The last chunk is only as large as "
"necessary. Similarly, files that are no larger than the chunk size only "
"have a final chunk, using only as much space as needed plus some "
"additional metadata."

#: ../source/core/gridfs.txt:28

"GridFS uses two collections to store files. One collection stores the "
"file chunks, and the other stores file metadata. The section :ref"
":`gridfs-collections` describes each collection in detail."

"When you query GridFS for a file, the driver will reassemble the chunks "

msgid "In MongoDB, use :term:`GridFS` for storing files larger than 16 MB."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/gridfs.txt:49
msgid ""
"In some situations, storing large files may be more efficient in a "
"MongoDB database than on a system-level filesystem."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/gridfs.txt:52
msgid ""
"If your filesystem limits the number of files in a directory, you can use"
" GridFS to store as many files as needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/gridfs.txt:55
msgid ""
"When you want to access information from portions of large files without "
"having to load whole files into memory, you can use GridFS to recall "
"sections of files without reading the entire file into memory."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/gridfs.txt:60
msgid ""
"When you want to keep your files and metadata automatically synced and "
"deployed across a number of systems and facilities, you can use GridFS. "
"When using :ref:`geographically distributed replica sets <replica-set-"
"geographical-distribution>`, MongoDB can distribute files and their "
"metadata automatically to a number of :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances and"
" facilities."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/gridfs.txt:67
msgid ""
"Do not use GridFS if you need to update the content of the entire file "
"atomically. As an alternative you can store multiple versions of each "
"file and specify the current version of the file in the metadata. You can"
" update the metadata field that indicates \"latest\" status in an atomic "
"update after uploading the new version of the file, and later remove "
"previous versions if needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/gridfs.txt:74
msgid ""
"Furthermore, if your files are all smaller than the 16 MB :limit:`BSON "
"Document Size` limit, consider storing each file in a single document "
"instead of using GridFS. You may use the BinData data type to store the "
"binary data. See your :ecosystem:`drivers </drivers>` documentation for "
