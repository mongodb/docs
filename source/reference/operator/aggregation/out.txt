.. pipeline:: $out

   Takes the documents returned by the aggregation pipeline and writes
   them to a specified collection. The :pipeline:`$out` operator must
   be *the last stage* in the pipeline.

   .. important::

      - The :pipeline:`$out` operator must be *the last stage* in the pipeline.

      - The :pipeline:`$out` operator cannot write results to a
        :doc:`capped collection </core/capped-collections>`.

      - .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-out-linearizable.rst

Syntax
------

.. note::

   MongoDB 4.2 adds a new syntax structure that implements expanded 
   functionality and flexibility around merging aggregation pipeline results
   into a target collection, including support for sharded collections and
   output modes that preserve the existing collection data. 

   MongoDB 4.2 continues support for the legacy $out syntax, which does not
   support any of the new functionality of the updated $out syntax.

The. :pipeline:`$out` stage can have one of the following syntaxes:

- .. versionadded:: 4.2

     .. code-block:: javascript
       
        {
           $out: 
             {
               to : "<output-collection>",
               mode : "insertDocuments" | "replaceDocuments" | "replaceCollection",
               db : "<output-database>",
               uniqueKey: <document>
             }
        }

     The :pipeline:`$out` takes a document with the following fields:

     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 20 80

        * - Field
          - Description

        * - ``to``

          - Specifies the target collection.

            If the mode is ``replaceDocuments`` or ``insertDocuments``, the
            target collection can only appear in the :pipeline:`$out` stage of
            the aggregation pipeline; i.e. the other stages in the pipeline
            must not access the collection.

            To output to a  sharded collection:
            
            - The collection must already exist.
            - The mode must be ``replaceDocuments`` or ``insertDocuments``.

        * - ``mode``

          - Specifies the mode for merging the aggregation pipeline output with
            the target collection:

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1
               :widths: 20 80

               * - Mode
                 - Description

               * - ``replaceCollection`` 

                 - :pipeline:`$out` replaces the ``to`` collection wholesale
                   with the output from the aggregation pipeline. The ``to``
                   collection cannot be in a different database than the
                   aggregation in this mode.
                   
                   Specifically, it writes documents to a temporary
                   collection. If the ``to`` collection exists, it copies over
                   indexes and collection options. Finally, :pipeline:`$out`
                   renames the temporary collection to the ``to`` collection
                   name. 

                   This is the same functionality as the 
                   :ref:`old syntax <2.6-out-syntax>`.

               * - ``replaceDocuments`` 

                 - :pipeline:`$out` writes documents directly to the ``to``
                   collection, performing a replacement-style update on any
                   document in the ``to`` collection with the same 
                   ``uniqueKey`` pattern as the document from the pipeline.

               * - ``insertDocuments`` 

                 - :pipeline:`$out` writes documents directly to the ``to``
                   collection, raising an error if a document exists in the
                   ``to`` collection with the same ``uniqueKey`` pattern as
                   one being written.

            To learn more about the behavior of ``mode``, see 
            :ref:`aggregation-out-behavior`.

        * - ``db``

          - Optional. Specifies the database of the ``to`` collection. Defaults
            to the database against which the aggregation was run. In
            ``replaceCollection`` mode this must be the same database as the
            aggregation.

        * - ``uniqueKey``

          - Optional. Specifies the fields that uniquely identify a document in
            the ``to`` collection for replacement or merge. Defaults to the
            document key ``{ _id : 1 }`` for an unsharded ``to`` collection or
            ``_id`` and all the fields of the shard key for a sharded ``to``
            collection. All fields must have a value of ``1``. Duplicate keys
            are forbidden.
        
            If the ``to`` collection is sharded, the ``uniqueKey`` must contain
            all the of the fields of the shard key. If the output collection
            does not exist, ``uniqueKey`` must be ``{ _id : 1 }``, the default 
            ``uniqueKey``.

            There must exist a :ref:`unique <index-type-unique>` index that
            covers the ``uniqueKey``, for any ordering of the ``uniqueKey``
            fields.

            .. _uniqueKey-requirements:

            This :ref:`unique <index-type-unique>` index:

            - must have the same :doc:`collation </reference/collation>` as the
              aggregation's collation
            - can be :ref:`sparse <index-type-sparse>`
            - can be a :ref:`multikey index <index-type-multikey>`
            - cannot be :ref:`partial <index-type-partial>`
            - cannot be :ref:`hashed <index-type-hashed>`
            - cannot be a :ref:`text <index-feature-text>` index
            - cannot be a :doc:`geo </core/geospatial-indexes>` index

            See :ref:`uniqueKey-behavior` for more details.

.. _2.6-out-syntax:

- .. versionadded:: 2.6

     The :pipeline:`$out` stage also has the following form:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { $out: "<output-collection>" }

     It is an alias with the same effect as:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {$out: {to: "<output-collection>", mode: "replaceCollection"}}

.. _aggregation-out-behavior:

Behaviors
---------

Replacing a Collection with the Aggregation Pipeline Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following behavior applies when specifying the ``replaceCollection`` mode
(or using the older syntax).

.. important::

   This mode is prohibited if the target collection is sharded or in a
   different database than the aggregation, as it can only create new unsharded
   collections in the aggregation database. To use a sharded collection or a
   collection in a different database than the aggregation, use either the
   ``replaceDocuments`` or ``insertDocuments`` mode.

If the output collection does not exist, the :pipeline:`$out` operation
creates a new unsharded collection in the same database as the aggregation.
This collection is not visible until the aggregation completes. If the
aggregation fails, MongoDB does not create the collection.

If the output collection already exists, then upon completion of the
aggregation the :pipeline:`$out` stage atomically replaces the existing
collection with the new results collection. Specifically, the :pipeline:`$out`
operation:

#. Creates a temp collection.
#. Copies the indexes from the existing collection to the temp collection.
#. Inserts the documents into the temp collection.
#. Calls :method:`db.collection.renameCollection` with ``dropTarget: true``
   to rename the temp collection to the destination collection.

The :pipeline:`$out` operation does not change any indexes that existed on the
previous collection. If the aggregation fails, the :pipeline:`$out` operation
makes no changes to the pre-existing collection.

Using $out to Replace Documents in an Existing Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following behavior applies when specifying the ``replaceDocuments`` mode.

If the output collection doesn't already exist, the :pipeline:`$out` operation
creates a new unsharded collection in the ``db`` database. Otherwise, it uses
the existing collection, which can be sharded. The :pipeline:`$out` stage
writes each document in the aggregation pipeline result set directly to the
``to`` collection.

If an existing document has the same ``uniqueKey`` pattern as a document from
the :pipeline:`$out` stage, the existing document is overwritten with a
replacement-style update. If the :pipeline:`$out` stage produces multiple
documents with the same ``uniqueKey`` pattern, it is indeterminate which of
those multiple documents is stored for that ``uniqueKey`` pattern.

If there is no existing document with the same ``uniqueKey`` pattern, 
:pipeline:`$out` inserts the document instead.

Using $out to Insert Documents into an Existing Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following behavior applies when specifying the ``insertDocuments`` mode.

If the output collection doesn't already exist, the :pipeline:`$out` operation
creates a new unsharded collection in the ``db`` database. Otherwise, it uses
the existing collection, which can be sharded. The :pipeline:`$out` stage
writes each document in the aggregation pipeline result set directly to the
``to`` collection.

If an existing document has the same ``uniqueKey`` pattern as a document from
the :pipeline:`$out` stage, the pipeline raises an error and stops
execution. The exact stop point is unspecified. Some inserts may have
completed and will not roll back.

Index Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pipeline will fail to complete if the documents produced by the
pipeline would violate any unique indexes, including the index on the
``_id`` field of the original output collection. 

$out Generates the _id Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ``_id`` field is not present in a document from the aggregation pipeline
results at the time of writing, the :pipeline:`$out` stage generates it
automatically.

.. _uniqueKey-behavior:

$out Collision Detection with ``uniqueKey``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$out` stage uses the ``uniqueKey`` to check for collison between
documents to replace them (for ``replaceDocuments``) or to throw an error (for
``insertDocuments``). At plan time, MongoDB verifies that there exists an index
that covers the ``uniqueKey``, for any ordering of the ``uniqueKey`` fields,
and fulfills the previously listed
:ref:`requirements <uniqueKey-requirements>`.

.. important::

   If the unique index used by ``uniqueKey`` is dropped mid-aggregation, there
   is no guarantee that the aggregation will be killed. If the aggregation
   continues, there is no guarantee that at most one document in the collection
   will match a ``uniqueKey`` pattern.
  
Other than the ``_id`` field, all fields in the ``uniqueKey`` must exist in the
output documents and must not be null or an array. If one of the ``uniqueKey``
fields is or is inside an array, use :pipeline:`$unwind` to transform it.

Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``$out`` is not allowed in :doc:`transactions </core/transactions>`.

Views
~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 4.2

The :pipeline:`$out` stage is not allowed as part of a :doc:`view
definition </core/views>`. If the view definition includes nested
pipeline (e.g. the view definition includes :pipeline:`$lookup` or
:pipeline:`$facet` stage), this :pipeline:`$out` stage restriction
applies to the nested pipelines as well. [#lookup]_

.. [#lookup]

   Starting in 4.2, you cannot include the :pipeline:`$out` stage in
   the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage's :ref:`nested pipeline
   <lookup-syntax-let-pipeline>`, regardless of whether the
   :pipeline:`$lookup` is part of a view definition.
   
``linearizable`` Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Examples
--------

replaceCollection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection ``books`` contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 8751, "title" : "The Banquet", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 2 }
   { "_id" : 8752, "title" : "Divine Comedy", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 1 }
   { "_id" : 8645, "title" : "Eclogues", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 2 }
   { "_id" : 7000, "title" : "The Odyssey", "author" : "Homer", "copies" : 10 }
   { "_id" : 7020, "title" : "Iliad", "author" : "Homer", "copies" : 10 }

The following aggregation operation pivots the data in the ``books``
collection to have titles grouped by authors and then writes
the results to the ``authors`` collection.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.books.aggregate( [
                         { $group : { _id : "$author", books: { $push: "$title" } } },
                         { $out : { to : "authors", mode : "replaceCollection" } }
                     ] )

This aggregation is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.books.aggregate( [
                         { $group : { _id : "$author", books: { $push: "$title" } } },
                         { $out : "authors" }
                     ] )

After the operation, the ``authors`` collection contains the following
documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : "Homer", "books" : [ "The Odyssey", "Iliad" ] }
   { "_id" : "Dante", "books" : [ "The Banquet", "Divine Comedy", "Eclogues" ] }

replaceDocuments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection ``phonebook`` holds employee names and phone numbers for a company's
employees. It contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : "Susan", "phone" : "55555" }
   { "_id" : "Bob", "phone" : "12121" }
   { "_id" : "Anna", "phone" : "33344" }

A collection ``employees`` has:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 8, "name": "Susan", "phone" : "55555", "title" : "developer", "updated" : 2016 }
   { "_id" : 9, "name": "Bob", "phone" : "12121", "title" : "developer", "updated" : 2017 }
   { "_id" : 10, "name": "Jake", "phone" : "63636", "title" : "intern", "updated" : 2018 }
   { "_id" : 11, "name": "Anna", "phone" : "88888", "title" : "lead", "updated" : 2018 }

The following aggregation pipeline:

- Matches all users whose ``updated`` field is greater than or equal to 2018
- Sorts by the document ``_id`` number
- Groups by their ``name`` and the :operator:`$last` ``phone`` value associated
  to that user
- Outputs the result set to ``phonebook`` using the ``replaceDocuments`` mode.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.employees.aggregate( [
                         { $match : { updated:  { $gte : 2018 } } },
                         { $sort : { _id : 1 } },
                         { $group : { _id : "$name", phone: {$last: "$phone" } } },
                         { $out : { to : "phonebook", mode : "replaceDocuments" } }
                     ] )

``uniqueKey`` is unspecified, so the pipeline uses the default value of
``{ _id : 1 }`` to identify documents for replacement. As ``_id`` is redefined
to ``name``, ``Anna`` matches to ``Anna``. After the operation, the
``phonebook`` collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : "Susan", "phone" : "55555" }
   { "_id" : "Bob", "phone" : "12121" }
   { "_id" : "Anna", "phone" : "88888" }
   { "_id" : "Jake", "phone" : "63636" }

Where Anna has been replaced and Jake is added.

insertDocuments and uniqueKey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection ``tickets`` contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {_id: "Bill", seat: 12, cost: 20, daySold: 14}
   {_id: "Sarah", seat: 2, cost: 25, daySold: 16}

A sharded collection ``seats`` is sharded on ``{ seat : 1 }`` and has the
unique index ``{ seat : 1 }``. It contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {_id: "Bill", seat: 12}
   {_id: "Sarah", seat: 2}

Two more tickets are sold and added to the ``tickets`` collection, such that
the ``tickets`` collection now holds the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {_id: "Bill", seat: 12, cost: 20, daySold: 14}
   {_id: "Sarah", seat: 2, cost: 25, daySold: 16}
   {_id: "Jake", seat: 5, cost:25, daySold: 17}
   {_id: "Beth", seat: 8, cost: 20, daySold: 19}

The following aggregation pipeline:

- Matches all users whose ``daySold`` field is greater than ``16``.
- projects the ``_id`` and ``seat`` to get each person and their assigned seat.
- Outputs the result set to ``seats`` using the ``insertDocuments`` mode.

The ``uniqueKey`` of ``{ seat : 1}`` makes sure that no seat gets assigned
twice.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.tickets.aggregate( [
                       { $match : { daySold : { $gt : 16 } } },
                       { $project: { seat: 1 } },
                       { $out : { to : "seats", mode : "insertDocuments",
                         uniqueKey: { seat : 1 } } }
                   ] )

After the operation, the ``seats`` collection contains the following
documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {_id: "Bill", seat: 12}
   {_id: "Sarah", seat: 2}
   {_id: "Jake", seat: 5}
   {_id: "Beth", seat: 8}
