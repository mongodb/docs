Ops Manager can backup databases to either another database (blockstore), to a
local file system or a combination of both. This tutorial covers using
file system stores to backup your MongoDB databases. 

.. note::
   Use multiple snapshot stores when you must provide data locality, add
   capacity, or meet regulatory requirements. 
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-data-locality` describes how to configure
   multiple snapshot stores in different data centers.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before creating any file system snapshot stores:

- Ensure a storage volume with sufficient capacity is attached to the |onprem|
  server to store the snapshot files and the oplog MongoDB database.

- :doc:`Deploy the dedicated MongoDB instance(s) 
  </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>` to host the oplog stores for this 
  snapshot store.


Procedures
----------

.. _add-filestore:

Add a File System Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/admin-add-filestore.rst


.. _edit-filestore:

Edit an Existing File System Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once created, file system stores are listed directly on the Snapshot Storage page in a table. Each row contains the settings for each File System Store.

.. _delete-filestore:

Delete a File System Store
