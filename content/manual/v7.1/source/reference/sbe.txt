To find and return query results, MongoDB uses one of the following
query engines:

- The classic query engine

- The {+sbe+}, which is available for some queries starting in MongoDB
  5.1.

MongoDB automatically selects the engine to execute the query. You
cannot manually specify an engine for a particular query.

MongoDB can use the {+sbe+} for a subset of queries provided certain
conditions are met. In most cases, the {+sbe-short+} provides improved
performance and lower CPU and memory costs compared to the classic query
engine.

MongoDB uses the classic engine for queries that are ineligible for the
{+sbe+}.

Eligible Queries for the {+sbe-short-title+}
----------------------------------------------------

MongoDB can use the {+sbe-short+} for the following queries:

- :pipeline:`$group` and :pipeline:`$lookup` pipeline stages when
  specific conditions are met. For more information, see
  :ref:`sbe-pipeline-optimizations`.

- :pipeline:`$match` and :pipeline:`$project` pipeline stages that use
  supported query operators and expressions.

- Certain :pipeline:`$sort` pipeline stages that do not include
  :expression:`$meta` sorts.

- :method:`~db.collection.find()` queries that use supported query
  operators and expressions.

.. note::

   The {+sbe-short+} does not support :ref:`geospatial query operators
   <query-operators-geospatial>`.

Determine which Query Engine was Used
-------------------------------------

There are a few ways to determine whether the classic engine or the
{+sbe-short+} was used to execute a query.

Check Query Explain Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The explain results for a query differ based on
which query engine was used. For example, explain results for queries
executed using the {+sbe-short+} include the ``explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.slotBasedPlan`` field.

For more information about the differences in explain results between
query engines, see :ref:`explain-output-structure`.

Check Slow Query Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see an example log message for a query that used the {+sbe-short+},
see :ref:`log-message-json-examples-slow-op`.
