|service| has disk capacity limits on single replica sets, scaling up to
4 TB for higher {+cluster+} tiers. To expand the total {+cluster+} storage
beyond default limits, you can enable extended storage in
the :ref:`Project Settings <project-settings>`. To accommodate further
scaling in the future, enable :ref:`sharding <cluster-option-sharding>`
for long-term expansion.
