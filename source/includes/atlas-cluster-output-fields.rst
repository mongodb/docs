   * - ``providerSettings.providerName``
     - Specifies the name of the cloud service provider on which 
       the server is provisioned. Value can be: 

       - ``AWS`` for Amazon AWS
       - ``GCP`` for Google Cloud Platform
       - ``AZURE`` for Microsot Azure

   * - ``providerSettings.regionName``
     - Specifies the physical location of the cluster. For a 
       complete list of regions, see cloud provider reference:

       - :atlas:`AWS <reference/amazon-aws/#amazon-aws>`
       - :atlas:`GCP <reference/google-gcp/#google-gcp>` 
       - :atlas:`Azure <reference/microsoft-azure/#microsoft-azure>`

   * - ``replicationFactor``
     - Specifies the number of :atlas:`replica set members 
       <reference/glossary/#term-replica-set>` in the cluster. The 
       possible values are ``3``, ``5``, ``7``.

   * - ``replicationSpec``
     - Configuration for each region in the cluster. Each 
       element in this object represents a region where 
       your cluster is deployed. 

   * - ``replicationSpec.<region>``
     - Specifies the physical location of the region. 

       Each ``<region>`` object describes the region’s priority 
       in elections and the number and type of MongoDB nodes 
       |service| deploys to the region. 

   * - ``replicationSpec.<region>.analyticsNodes``
     - Specifies the number of :atlas:`analytics nodes 
       <faq/#analytics-nodes-overview>` in the region. 
       Analytics nodes are read-only, and can never become 
       the :atlas:`primary <reference/glossary/#term-primary>`.

   * - ``replicationSpec.<region>.electableNodes``
     - Specifies the number of electable nodes in the 
       region. Electable nodes can become the 
       :atlas:`primary <reference/glossary/#term-primary>` 
       and can facilitate local reads.

   * - ``replicationSpec.<region>.priority``
     - Specifies the election priority of the region. The highest 
       possible priority is ``7``, which identifies the ``Preferred 
       Region`` of the cluster. |service| places the primary node in 
       the ``Preferred Region``. The lowest possible priority is ``0``, 
       which identifies a read-only region.

       You can have any number of priority ``0`` read only regions. 
       Priorities ``1`` through ``7`` are exclusive: only one region 
       per cluster can be assigned a given priority.

   * - ``replicationSpec.<region>.readOnlyNodes``
     - Specifies the number of read-only nodes in the region. Read-only 
       nodes can never become the primary member, but can facilitate 
       local reads.

   * - ``replicationSpecs``
     - Configuration for each zone in a :atlas:`Global Cluster 
       <global-clusters>`. Each object in this array represents a 
       zone where |service| deploys nodes for your :atlas:`Global Cluster 
       <global-clusters>`.

   * - ``replicationSpecs.id``
     - Specifies the unique identifier of the replication object.

   * - ``replicationSpecs.numShards``
     - Specifies the number of shards to deploy in the specified 
       zone.

   * - ``replicationSpecs.zoneName``
     - Specifies the name for the zone in a :atlas:`Global Cluster 
       <global-clusters>`.

   * - ``replicationSpecs.regionConfig``
     - Configuration for the physical location of the region. Each 
       ``regionsConfig`` object describes the region’s priority in 
       elections and the number and type of MongoDB nodes that 
       |service| deploys to the region.

   * - | ``replicationSpecs[n].regionsConfig``
       | ``.<regionName>.analyticsNodes``
     - Specifies the number of analytics nodes to deploy in the 
       region.

   * - | ``replicationSpecs[n].regionsConfig``
       | ``.<regionName>.electableNodes``
     - Number of electable nodes for |service| to deploy to the region.
       Electable nodes can become the :term:`primary` and can
       facilitate local reads.

   * - | ``replicationSpecs[n].regionsConfig``
       | ``.<regionName>.priority``
     - Election priority of the region. If you have regions with only
       read-only nodes, set this value to ``0``.

   * - | ``replicationSpecs[n].regionsConfig``
       | ``.<regionName>.readOnlyNodes``
     - Number of read-only nodes for |service| to deploy to the region.
       Read-only nodes can never become the :term:`primary`, but can
       facilitate local-reads.

       Specify ``0`` if you do not want any read-only nodes in the
       region.

   * - ``srvAddress``
     - The :manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>` 
       for connecting to the |service| cluster. The ``+srv`` modifier 
       forces the connection to use |tls|. The ``mongoURI`` parameter 
       lists additional options.

   * - ``stateName``
     - The current status of the cluster. Value can be:

       - ``IDLE``
       - ``CREATING``
       - ``UPDATING``
       - ``DELETING``
       - ``DELETED``
       - ``REPAIRING``
