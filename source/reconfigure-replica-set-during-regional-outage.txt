During a regional outage, your {+cluster+} may not have a primary node
if the regional outage affects a majority of the cluster's electable
nodes. You can use the {+atlas-ui+} to restore your |service| multi-region
{+cluster+} by :ref:`reconfiguring your {+cluster+} <reconfigure-cluster-procedure>`.

If you reconfigure your {+cluster+} during a regional outage, your
replica set may lose data in the following circumstances:

- If your MongoDB process didn't replicate write operations to the node
  that becomes primary after the reconfiguration in any {+cluster+}.
  Your replica set rolls back these writes when the unavailable members
  become available again. To learn more, see :manual:`Rollbacks During
  Replica Set Failover </core/replica-set-rollbacks/>`. 
- If your MongoDB process didn't replicate chunk migrations and perform
  a roll back in :term:`sharded {+clusters+} <sharded cluster>`. The data
  inconsistency may cause :manual:`orphaned chunks
  </reference/glossary/#orphaned-document>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Your cluster must be experiencing a total outage of nodes in one or more
regions with at least one electable node remaining in another region.

For assistance with other causes of node outages, :ref:`contact support
<request-support>`.

.. _reconfigure-cluster-procedure:

Procedure
---------

To restore your |service| multi-region {+cluster+} from an outage, you
must :manual:`manually reconfigure
</reference/method/rs.reconfig/#std-label-rs-reconfig-method-force>`
your replica set:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: For the {+cluster+} you want to recover, click the :guilabel:`...` button.
   
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Edit Configuration`.
    
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region`.
      
      Under :guilabel:`Electable nodes for high availability`, you
      can add new nodes to:

      - An existing region by editing the number of nodes in the :guilabel:`Nodes` column
      - A new region by clicking :guilabel:`+ Add a provider/region` 

      .. tip::

         We strongly advise not adding nodes to one of the regions with
         an outage.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Review Changes`. 

      Read the :guilabel:`Considerations for force configuration`, and
      check the box next to :guilabel:`I have reviewed these
      considerations for force configuration and agree to proceed`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Apply Changes`.
