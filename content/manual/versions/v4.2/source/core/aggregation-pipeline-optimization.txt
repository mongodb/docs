Aggregation pipeline operations have an optimization phase which
attempts to reshape the pipeline for improved performance.

To see how the optimizer transforms a particular aggregation pipeline,
include the :method:`explain <db.collection.aggregate()>` option in the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method.

.. _aggregation-pipeline-projection-optimization:

Projection Optimization
-----------------------

The aggregation pipeline can determine if it requires only a subset of
the fields in the documents to obtain the results. If so, the pipeline
will only use those required fields, reducing the amount of data
passing through the pipeline.

.. _aggregation-pipeline-sequence-optimization:

Pipeline Sequence Optimization
------------------------------

.. _agg-project-addFields-match-optimization:

(``$project`` or ``$unset`` or ``$addFields`` or ``$set``) + ``$match`` Sequence Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an aggregation pipeline that contains a projection stage
(:pipeline:`$project` or :pipeline:`$unset` or
:pipeline:`$addFields` or  :pipeline:`$set`) followed by a
:pipeline:`$match` stage, MongoDB moves any filters in the
:pipeline:`$match` stage that do not require values computed in the
projection stage to a new :pipeline:`$match` stage before the
projection.

If an aggregation pipeline contains multiple projection and/or
:pipeline:`$match` stages, MongoDB performs this optimization for each
:pipeline:`$match` stage, moving each :pipeline:`$match` filter before
all projection stages that the filter does not depend on.

Consider a pipeline of the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 9-14

   { $addFields: {
       maxTime: { $max: "$times" },
       minTime: { $min: "$times" }
   } },
   { $project: {
       _id: 1, name: 1, times: 1, maxTime: 1, minTime: 1,
       avgTime: { $avg: ["$maxTime", "$minTime"] }
   } },
   { $match: {
       name: "Joe Schmoe",
       maxTime: { $lt: 20 },
       minTime: { $gt: 5 },
       avgTime: { $gt: 7 }
   } }

The optimizer breaks up the :pipeline:`$match` stage into four
individual filters, one for each key in the :pipeline:`$match` query
document. The optimizer then moves each filter before as many projection
stages as possible, creating new :pipeline:`$match` stages as needed.
Given this example, the optimizer produces the following *optimized*
pipeline:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 6, 11

   { $match: { name: "Joe Schmoe" } },
   { $addFields: {
       maxTime: { $max: "$times" },
       minTime: { $min: "$times" }
   } },
   { $match: { maxTime: { $lt: 20 }, minTime: { $gt: 5 } } },
   { $project: {
       _id: 1, name: 1, times: 1, maxTime: 1, minTime: 1,
       avgTime: { $avg: ["$maxTime", "$minTime"] }
   } },
   { $match: { avgTime: { $gt: 7 } } }

The :pipeline:`$match` filter ``{ avgTime: { $gt: 7 } }`` depends on the
:pipeline:`$project` stage to compute the ``avgTime`` field. The
:pipeline:`$project` stage is the last projection stage in this
pipeline, so the :pipeline:`$match` filter on ``avgTime`` could not be
moved.

The ``maxTime`` and ``minTime`` fields are computed in the
:pipeline:`$addFields` stage but have no dependency on the
:pipeline:`$project` stage. The optimizer created a new
:pipeline:`$match` stage for the filters on these fields and placed it
before the :pipeline:`$project` stage.

The :pipeline:`$match` filter ``{ name: "Joe Schmoe" }`` does not
use any values computed in either the :pipeline:`$project` or
:pipeline:`$addFields` stages so it was moved to a new
:pipeline:`$match` stage before both of the projection stages.

.. note::
   After optimization, the filter ``{ name: "Joe Schmoe" }`` is in
   a :pipeline:`$match` stage at the beginning of the pipeline. This has
   the added benefit of allowing the aggregation to use an index on the
   ``name`` field when initially querying the collection.
   See :ref:`aggregation-pipeline-operators-and-performance` for more
   information.

.. _agg-sort-match-optimization:

``$sort`` + ``$match`` Sequence Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you have a sequence with :pipeline:`$sort` followed by a
:pipeline:`$match`, the :pipeline:`$match` moves before the
:pipeline:`$sort` to minimize the number of objects to sort. For
example, if the pipeline consists of the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort: { age : -1 } },
   { $match: { status: 'A' } }

During the optimization phase, the optimizer transforms the sequence to
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $match: { status: 'A' } },
   { $sort: { age : -1 } }

``$redact`` + ``$match`` Sequence Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When possible, when the pipeline has the :pipeline:`$redact` stage
immediately followed by the :pipeline:`$match` stage, the aggregation
can sometimes add a portion of the :pipeline:`$match` stage before the
:pipeline:`$redact` stage. If the added :pipeline:`$match` stage is at
the start of a pipeline, the aggregation can use an index as well as
query the collection to limit the number of documents that enter the
pipeline. See :ref:`aggregation-pipeline-operators-and-performance` for
more information.

For example, if the pipeline consists of the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $redact: { $cond: { if: { $eq: [ "$level", 5 ] }, then: "$$PRUNE", else: "$$DESCEND" } } },
   { $match: { year: 2014, category: { $ne: "Z" } } }

The optimizer can add the same :pipeline:`$match` stage before the
:pipeline:`$redact` stage:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $match: { year: 2014 } },
   { $redact: { $cond: { if: { $eq: [ "$level", 5 ] }, then: "$$PRUNE", else: "$$DESCEND" } } },
   { $match: { year: 2014, category: { $ne: "Z" } } }

.. _agg-project-skip-optimization:

``$project``/``$unset`` + ``$skip`` Sequence Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.2

When you have a sequence with :pipeline:`$project` or :pipeline:`$unset` followed by 
:pipeline:`$skip`, the :pipeline:`$skip` 
moves before :pipeline:`$project`. For example, if
the pipeline consists of the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort: { age : -1 } },
   { $project: { status: 1, name: 1 } },
   { $skip: 5 }

During the optimization phase, the optimizer transforms the sequence to
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort: { age : -1 } },
   { $skip: 5 },
   { $project: { status: 1, name: 1 } }

.. _aggregation-pipeline-coalescence-optimization:

Pipeline Coalescence Optimization
---------------------------------

When possible, the optimization phase coalesces a pipeline stage into
its predecessor. Generally, coalescence occurs *after* any sequence
reordering optimization.

.. _agg-sort-limit-coalescence:

``$sort`` + ``$limit`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

When a :pipeline:`$sort` precedes a :pipeline:`$limit`, the optimizer
can coalesce the :pipeline:`$limit` into the :pipeline:`$sort` if no
intervening stages modify the number of documents 
(e.g. :pipeline:`$unwind`, :pipeline:`$group`).
MongoDB will not coalesce the :pipeline:`$limit` into the
:pipeline:`$sort` if there are pipeline stages that change the number of
documents between the :pipeline:`$sort` and :pipeline:`$limit` stages..

For example, if the pipeline consists of the following stages:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort : { age : -1 } },
   { $project : { age : 1, status : 1, name : 1 } },
   { $limit: 5 }

During the optimization phase, the optimizer coalesces the sequence
to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "$sort" : {
          "sortKey" : {
             "age" : -1
          },
          "limit" : NumberLong(5)
       }
   },
   { "$project" : { 
            "age" : 1, 
            "status" : 1, 
            "name" : 1 
     } 
   }

This allows the sort operation to only maintain the
top ``n`` results as it progresses, where ``n`` is the specified limit,
and MongoDB only needs to store ``n`` items in memory
[#coalescence-allowDiskUse]_. See :ref:`sort-and-memory` for more
information.

.. admonition:: Sequence Optimization with $skip

   If there is a :pipeline:`$skip` stage between the :pipeline:`$sort`
   and :pipeline:`$limit` stages, MongoDB will coalesce the
   :pipeline:`$limit` into the :pipeline:`$sort` stage and increase the
   :pipeline:`$limit` value by the :pipeline:`$skip` amount. See
   :ref:`agg-sort-skip-limit-sequence` for an example.

.. [#coalescence-allowDiskUse] The optimization will still apply when
   ``allowDiskUse`` is ``true`` and the ``n`` items exceed the
   :ref:`aggregation memory limit <agg-memory-restrictions>`.

.. _agg-limit-limit-coalescence:

``$limit`` + ``$limit`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :pipeline:`$limit` immediately follows another
:pipeline:`$limit`, the two stages can coalesce into a single
:pipeline:`$limit` where the limit amount is the *smaller* of the two
initial limit amounts. For example, a pipeline contains the following
sequence:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $limit: 100 },
   { $limit: 10 }

Then the second :pipeline:`$limit` stage can coalesce into the first
:pipeline:`$limit` stage and result in a single :pipeline:`$limit`
stage where the limit amount ``10`` is the minimum of the two initial
limits ``100`` and ``10``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $limit: 10 }

.. _agg-skip-skip-coalescence:

``$skip`` + ``$skip`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :pipeline:`$skip` immediately follows another :pipeline:`$skip`,
the two stages can coalesce into a single :pipeline:`$skip` where the
skip amount is the *sum* of the two initial skip amounts. For example, a
pipeline contains the following sequence:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $skip: 5 },
   { $skip: 2 }

Then the second :pipeline:`$skip` stage can coalesce into the first
:pipeline:`$skip` stage and result in a single :pipeline:`$skip`
stage where the skip amount ``7`` is the sum of the two initial
limits ``5`` and ``2``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $skip: 7 }

.. _agg-match-match-coalescence:

``$match`` + ``$match`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :pipeline:`$match` immediately follows another
:pipeline:`$match`, the two stages can coalesce into a single
:pipeline:`$match` combining the conditions with an
:expression:`$and`. For example, a pipeline contains the following
sequence:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $match: { year: 2014 } },
   { $match: { status: "A" } }

Then the second :pipeline:`$match` stage can coalesce into the first
:pipeline:`$match` stage and result in a single :pipeline:`$match`
stage 

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $match: { $and: [ { "year" : 2014 }, { "status" : "A" } ] } }

.. _agg-lookup-unwind-coalescence:

``$lookup`` + ``$unwind`` Coalescence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.2

When a :pipeline:`$unwind` immediately follows another
:pipeline:`$lookup`, and the :pipeline:`$unwind` operates on the ``as``
field of the :pipeline:`$lookup`, the optimizer can coalesce the
:pipeline:`$unwind` into the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage. This avoids
creating large intermediate documents.

For example, a pipeline contains the following sequence:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     $lookup: {
       from: "otherCollection",
       as: "resultingArray",
       localField: "x",
       foreignField: "y"
     }
   },
   { $unwind: "$resultingArray"}

The optimizer can coalesce the :pipeline:`$unwind` stage into the
:pipeline:`$lookup` stage. If you run the aggregation with ``explain``
option, the ``explain`` output shows the coalesced stage:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     $lookup: {
       from: "otherCollection",
       as: "resultingArray",
       localField: "x",
       foreignField: "y",
       unwinding: { preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: false }
     }
   }

Indexes
~~~~~~~

The :ref:`query planner <query-plans-query-optimization>` analyzes
an aggregation pipeline to determine if :ref:`indexes <indexes>`
can be used to improve pipeline performance.

The following list shows some pipeline stages that can use indexes:

``$match`` stage
  :pipeline:`$match` can use an index to filter documents if
  :pipeline:`$match` is the first stage in a pipeline.

``$sort`` stage
  :pipeline:`$sort` can use an index if :pipeline:`$sort` is not
  preceded by a :pipeline:`$project`, :pipeline:`$unwind`, or
  :pipeline:`$group` stage.

``$group`` stage
  :pipeline:`$group` can potentially use an index to find the first
  document in each group if:
  
  - :pipeline:`$group` is preceded by :pipeline:`$sort` that sorts the
    field to group by, and

  - there is an index on the grouped field that matches the sort order,
    and

  - :group:`$first` is the only accumulator in :pipeline:`$group`.

  See :ref:`group-pipeline-optimization` for an example.

``$geoNear`` stage
  :pipeline:`$geoNear` can use a geospatial index. :pipeline:`$geoNear`
  must be the first stage in an aggregation pipeline.

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, in some cases, an aggregation pipeline can use
a ``DISTINCT_SCAN`` index plan that returns one document per index key 
value.

Additionally, stages later in the pipeline that retrieve data from 
other, unmodified collections can use indexes on those collections 
for optimization. These stages include:

- :pipeline:`$lookup`
- :pipeline:`$graphLookup`
- :pipeline:`$unionWith`

Example
-------
.. _agg-sort-skip-limit-sequence:

``$sort`` + ``$skip`` + ``$limit`` Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A pipeline contains a sequence of :pipeline:`$sort` followed by a
:pipeline:`$skip` followed by a :pipeline:`$limit`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $sort: { age : -1 } },
   { $skip: 10 },
   { $limit: 5 }

The optimizer performs :ref:`agg-sort-limit-coalescence` to
transforms the sequence to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "$sort" : {
         "sortKey" : {
            "age" : -1
         },
         "limit" : NumberLong(15)
      }
   },
   {
      "$skip" : NumberLong(10)
   }

MongoDB increases the :pipeline:`$limit` amount with the reordering.
