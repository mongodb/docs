.. _version-6.7:

What's New in 6.7
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.7 release includes the following features:

- Adds support for the ``MONGODB-OIDC`` authentication mechanism when connected to 
  MongoDB Server v7.0 and later. The driver supports authentication with Azure
  machine authentication, GCP machine authentication, callback authentication,
  and human interaction callback authentication facets.

- Fixes an issue where setting the ``useBigInt64`` flag to ``true`` caused the internal
  ``compareTopologyVersion`` function to generate an error.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.7.0 Release Notes
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.7.0>`__ on
GitHub.

.. _version-6.6:

What's New in 6.6
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.6 release includes the following features:

- Upgrades to using BSON 6.7.0. For details about the new BSON features, see the
  release notes for `BSON 6.5.0
  <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.5.0>`__,
  `BSON 6.6.0 <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.6.0>`__, and
  `BSON 6.7.0 <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.7.0>`__.

- Adds the ``addStage()`` method to the fluid aggregation API. You can use this method to
  add aggregation pipeline stages individually, as shown in the following
  example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     const documents = await users.aggregate().addStage({ $project: { name: true } }).toArray();

- Adds the ``cause`` and ``dependencyName`` fields to the ``MongoMissingDependencyError``
  class. You can use these fields to programmatically determine if a package is missing
  or why a package didn't load.

- Adds the ``minRoundTripTime`` property to the ``ServerDescription`` class. This
  property contains the minimum round-trip time over the last 10 heartbeats.

- Adds the ``toJSON()`` method to the ``TopologyDescription`` class. Although you can use
  this method to stringify ``TopologyDescription`` objects to JSON, we
  recommend using Node's ``util.inspect()`` method instead, because it properly handles
  all types used in JavaScript and the driver.

- Adds cursor options support for the ``Collection.indexExists()``,
  ``Collection.indexes()``, and ``Collection.indexInformation()`` methods in Typescript.

- Removes support for the ``readConcern`` and ``writeConcern`` options from the
  ``Collection.listSearchIndexes()`` method. ``listSearchIndexes()`` is an Atlas-specific method, and Atlas
  search indexes don't support these options.

- Redefines the ``ServerDescription.roundTripTime`` property as a moving average. Previously,
  it was a weighted average of the most recently observed heartbeat duration and the
  previous duration.

- You can specify the type of a search index when creating the index, as shown
  in the following example:

  .. code-block:: js
     :emphasize-lines: 3
    
     const indexName = await collection.createSearchIndex({
         name: 'my-vector-search-index',
         type: 'vectorSearch',
         definition: {
             mappings: { dynamic: false }
         }
     });

- The ``UpdateFilter.$currentDate`` property no longer throws an error when you pass
  it to a compound method, such as ``findOneAndUpdate()``, on a collection with a limited schema.

- The driver throws a ``MongoTransactionError`` only if you provide a
  ``ReadPreferenceMode`` other than ``primary`` and then try to perform a command that
  involves a read operation.

- The data type of the ``TopologyDescription.error`` property is ``MongoError``.

- The ``Collection.indexExists()`` method no longer supports the ``full`` option.

- The ``Collection.indexInformation()``, ``Collection.indexes()``, and
  ``Db.indexInformation()`` methods have a return type of
  ``IndexDescriptionCompact | IndexDescriptionInfo[]`` in TypeScript. 

- When retrieving AWS KMS (Key Management System) credentials, the driver no longer
  throws an error when it receives an access key that includes
  an expiration timestamp.

- The ``ClusterTime`` interface no longer defines the ``signature`` field as required in
  TypeScript.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.6.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.6.0>`__ on
GitHub.

.. _version-6.5:

What's New in 6.5
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.5 release includes the following features:

- Updates bulk write operations to use the ``pkFactory`` class for document
  ID generation.

.. warning::

   If you previously specified an instance of a ``pkFactory`` to handle
   bulk writes, the ``_id`` fields of the documents inserted by using bulk
   writes may be inconsistent with the behavior in this version.

- Fixes the read preference that is sent with read operations to 
  ``primaryPreferred`` when the driver is connected to a secondary node in
  the replica set.

- Fixes a memory leak in promise creation for socket operations.

- Reduces first-time connection latency when connecting to a DNS seedlist by
  querying the ``SRV`` and ``TXT`` records in parallel.

- Adds tracking to container metadata when running a client in Kubernetes
  or a container environment in the ``client.env.container`` field of the
  handshake document.

- Adds the original error document returned by the server to the
  ``errorResponse`` field of the ``MongoServerError`` document.

- Deprecates the ``CloseOptions`` interface which is unused by the driver.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.5.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.5.0>`__ on
GitHub.

.. _version-6.4:

What's New in 6.4
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.4 release includes the following features:

- When multiple ``mongos`` instances are available, different servers are used
  for read and write retry attempts.

- Caches AWS credentials at the client level, rather than for each
  authentication.

- Upgrades to using BSON 6.4.0. For details about the new BSON features, see the
  release notes for `BSON 6.3.0
  <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.3.0>`__ and `BSON 6.4.0
  <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.4.0>`__.

- Read operations that result in an ``ExceededTimeLimit`` error are retried.

- Fixes a request issue related to :ref:`TLS sockets <node-connect-tls>` and
  :manual:`KMS Providers
  </core/queryable-encryption/fundamentals/kms-providers/>`.

- Fixes the base64 padding on the ``saslContinue`` command to allow for mongosh
  authentication.

- Types ``countDocuments`` using ``Filter<Schema>`` rather than ``Document``,
  which enables autocompletion and helps prevent downstream typing issues.

- Fixes a type error in the ``$addToSet`` option of the ``bulkWrite`` command.
  The driver skips ``$addToSet`` validation you extend your types from
  ``Document`` or ``any``, or use properties of any type.

- Fixes the ``ServerHeartbeatSucceeded`` and ``ServerHeartbeatFailed`` event
  heartbeat duration so that it does not include the time to create the socket.

- Appropriately emits errors from cursor transform streams, rather than
  absorbing them.

- Makes AWS session tokens optional when a username and password are provided,
  and allows AWS SDK to handle the authentication requests.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.4.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.4.0>`__ on
GitHub.

.. _version-6.3:

What's New in 6.3
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.3 release includes the following features:

- Adds the ``serverMonitoringMode`` client option to control the
  behavior of the monitoring connection among the nodes in a topology.
  This option takes a value of ``auto`` (default), ``poll``, or
  ``stream``. To learn more, see the entry for this option in the
  :ref:`node-connection-options` guide.

  You can set the ``serverMonitoringMode`` option in a
  ``MongoClientOptions`` instance or as a connection string option. The
  following example shows how to create a client with the option set to
  ``stream``:

  .. code-block:: js

     new MongoClient('<connection string>', { serverMonitoringMode: 'stream' });

- Fixes a connection leak when the ``serverApi`` client option is set.

- Deprecates the ``contentType`` and ``aliases`` GridFS options. To
  store the content type and aliases of a file, add ``contentType`` and ``aliases``
  fields to the ``metadata`` document.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.3.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.3.0>`__.

.. _version-6.2:

What's New in 6.2
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.2 release includes the following features:

- Updates the ``bson`` package version to 6.2.0 to include
  color visualization of types, as shown in the following image:

  .. figure:: /includes/figures/bson-color.png
     :alt: A screenshot of the terminal that shows printing in color

  To learn more, see the `bson v6.2.0 release notes
  <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.2.0>`__.

- Ensures that the ``result.insertedIds`` property of a bulk write error type
  contains the ``_id`` values of successfully inserted documents. In
  previous versions, when a bulk write operation rejected an insert
  operation, the ``result.insertedIds`` property contained the
  ``_id`` values for all attempted inserts.

- Closes the implicit session created when running the ``findOne()``
  method on a time series collection regardless of the outcome of the
  operation.

- Allows the creation of collections that have names that start or end with the
  ``.`` character. This change aligns the driver's database and
  collection name-checking behavior with the server's.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.2.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.2.0>`__.

.. _version-6.1:

What's New in 6.1
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v6.1 release includes the following features:

- Updates the ``bson`` package version to 6.1.0 to expose the
  ``Decimal128.fromStringWithRounding()`` method. To learn more, see the
  `v6.1.0 bson release notes <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v6.1.0>`__.

- Detects environment variables for region settings when
  authenticating by using the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism.
  To instruct the driver to use your region options, you must set both
  of the following environment variables:

  - ``AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS``
  - ``AWS_REGION``

- Fixes a memory leak issue caused by recursive calls to the ``next()``
  method of the ``ChangeStream`` type.

To learn more about this release, see the
`v6.1.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.1.0>`__.

   This driver version introduces breaking changes. For a list of these changes, see
   the :ref:`Version 6.0 Breaking Changes section <node-breaking-changes-v6.0>` in the
   Upgrade guide.

The {+driver-short+} v6.0 release includes the following features:

.. important:: Deprecation Notice

   All of the ``ssl``-prefixed options in the ``MongoClientOptions``
   type are deprecated. In addition, the ``tlsCertificateFile`` option
   is deprecated.

   Instead, you should store your certificates in a ``SecureContext``
   object or set the ``tls``-prefixed options in your
   ``MongoClientOptions`` instance. To learn more, see :ref:`node-connect-tls`.

- Removal of support for the ``addUser()`` helper command. Use the
  :manual:`createUser </reference/command/createUser>` MongoDB Shell command instead.

- Removal of support for the ``collStats`` operation. Use the
  :manual:`$collStats </reference/operator/aggregation/collStats>` aggregation operator
  instead.

- The ``options`` field of the ``ConnectionPoolCreatedEvent`` type
  contains only the following fields, which are the non-default pool
  options:

  - ``maxConnecting``
  - ``maxPoolSize``
  - ``minPoolSize``
  - ``maxIdleTimeMS``
  - ``waitQueueTimeoutMS``

- The driver asynchronously reads files set in the ``tlsCAFile`` and
  ``tlsCertificateKeyFile`` connection options when you call
  the ``MongoClient.connect()`` method, not when you create a
  ``MongoClient`` instance.

- Removal of the ``keepAlive`` and ``keepAliveInitialDelay`` connection
  options. The value of ``keepAlive`` is permanently set to ``true`` and the
  value of ``keepAliveInitialDelay`` is set to 300000 milliseconds (300
  seconds).

  To learn how to set keepalive settings at a system level,
  see the :manual:`Does TCP keepalive time affect MongoDB Deployments? </faq/diagnostics/#does-tcp-keepalive-time-affect-mongodb-deployments->`
  FAQ entry in the Server manual.

  - ``willRetryWrite``
  - ``omitReadPreference``
  - ``writeConcern``
  - ``explain``
  - ``readConcern``
  - ``collation``
  - ``maxTimeMS``
  - ``comment``
  - ``retryWrites``
  - ``dbName``
  - ``authdb``
  - ``noResponse``

  Although you cannot pass these options to the
  ``Db.command()`` method, you can still set them in the command
  document. To learn more, see the :ref:`Command Options
  <node-command-options>` section of the Run a Command guide.

What's New in 5.1
-----------------

New features of the 5.1 {+driver-short+} release include:

- The driver now supports automatic serialization of JavaScript ``bigint`` to
  ``BSON.Long``. It also supports the deserialization of ``BSON.Long`` values returned
  from the server to ``bigint`` values when the ``useBigInt64`` flag is passed
  as true.

To learn more, see the `v5.1.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v5.1.0>`__.

.. _version-5.0:

What's New in 5.0
-----------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes in v5.0

   This driver version introduces breaking changes. For a list of these changes, see
   the :ref:`Version 5.0 Breaking Changes section <node-breaking-changes-v5.0>` in the
   Upgrade guide.

New features of the 5.0 {+driver-short+} release include:

- By default, the driver no longer checks types referenced in dot notation
  unless the ``StrictFilter`` type annotation is explicitly
  used. To learn more about this change, see the :ref:`Typescript fundamentals
  page <node-ts-type-safety>`.

  .. note::

     This change is for Typescript only, and does not affect queries or operations
     at runtime.

- Optional installation of ``@aws-sdk/credential-providers`` as a peer dependency.

  - The driver no longer includes AWS SDK modules by default. Use the
    following ``npm`` command to install the SDK:

    .. code-block:: bash

       npm install --save "@aws-sdk/credential-providers@^3.201.0"

    If you install the SDK, ``npm`` notifies you if the version of the SDK you
    installed is incompatible with the driver. Once you install the
    dependency successfully, the driver uses the AWS SDK itself to
    manage credentials from the environment.

.. _version-4.17:

What's New in 4.17
------------------

New features of the 4.17 {+driver-short+} release include:

What's New in 4.13
------------------

New features of the 4.13 {+driver-short+} release include:

- Automatic cancellation of in-flight operations in the connection pool when
  the driver encounters network timeout errors.
- Disabled causal consistency in implicit sessions to prevent conflicting
  with the ``linearizable`` and ``available`` read concern settings.
- Fixed a potential memory leak by ensuring that the driver destroys
  ``MessageStream`` instances whenever their connections are destroyed.

.. _version-4.12:

What's New in 4.12

.. important:: Upgrade Driver to Version 4.12.1

   The 4.12.1 {+driver-short+} includes a fix to a regression in monitoring logic
   that could cause processes to crash.

New features of the 4.12 {+driver-short+} release include:

- Redefinition of the ``ChangeStream`` class as an async iterable.
  You can use ``ChangeStream`` instances in any context that expects an
  ``AsyncIterator``.

  - Notably, change streams can now be used in Javascript ``for-await``
    loops:

    .. code-block:: js
       :copyable: false

       const changeStream = myColl.watch();
       for await (const change of changeStream) {
         console.log("Received change: ", change);
       }

- Fix to server monitoring when the driver skips monitoring events. In
  this release, the driver always updates its view of the topology when
  processing monitoring events.

- Performance improvements with buffering as a result of modification to
  data structures used internally in the driver.

To learn more, see the `v4.12.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.12.0>`__.

.. _version-4.11:

What's New in 4.11
------------------

Prioritization Order in Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When connecting to {+mdb-server+} version 6.0 or later, the driver prioritizes
``electionId`` settings before ``setVersion`` settings during Server Discovery and
Monitoring events. In previous versions, the prioritization order was reversed.

Changes to AWS Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you install the optional ``aws-sdk/credential-providers``
dependency, the driver uses the AWS SDK to retrieve AWS credentials from the
environment.

To learn more about this behavior, see the :ref:`MONGODB-AWS
<mongodb-aws>` section of the Authentication Mechanisms guide.

Mutually Recursive Schema Type Checking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release includes added support for **mutually
recursive** collection schema types. The driver also provides type safety for
dot-notation queries up to a depth of eight in this release. At a depth greater
than or equal to eight, Typescript successfully compiles your code but does not
provide type safety. This depth limit on recursive types is a current limitation
of TypeScript.

Example
```````

Suppose we have a collection of type ``Collection<Author>`` that contains the
following mutually recursive types:

.. code-block:: js
   :copyable: false

   interface Author {
       name: string;
       bestBook: Book;
   }

   interface Book {
       title: string;
       author: Author;
    }

TypeScript enforces type checking up to a depth of eight. The following
code causes a TypeScript compilation error because the ``name`` property
value must be a ``string`` type:

.. code-block:: js
   :copyable: false

   myColl.findOne({ 'bestBook.author.bestBook.title': 25 });

At a depth greater than or equal to eight, TypeScript compiles your code but no
longer type checks it. For example, the following code assigns a ``number`` to a
``string`` property but does not cause a compilation error because the
referenced property is at a depth of 10:

.. code-block:: js
   :copyable: false

   myColl.findOne({
       'bestBook.author.bestBook.author.bestBook.author.bestBook.author.bestBook.author.name': 25
   });

To learn more, see the `v4.11.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.11.0>`__.

.. _version-4.10:

What's New in 4.10
------------------

New features of the 4.10 {+driver-short+} release include:

- Callback Deprecation

  - Callbacks are now deprecated in favor of Promises. Callbacks will
    be removed in the next major release. The Node driver team recommends
    migrating to promises where possible:

    - Use ``async/await`` syntax.
    - Use the Node.js `callbackify utility <https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#utilcallbackifyoriginal>`__:

      .. code-block:: js

         require('util').callbackify(() => myColl.findOne())(callback)

    - Use :mdn:`then <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then>` syntax:

      .. code-block:: js

         myColl.findOne().then(res => callback(null, res), err => callback(err))

  - If you are unable to migrate to Promises in a large codebase, you can
    use the legacy `{+driver-short+} with optional callback support <https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-legacy>`__.

To learn more, see `v4.10.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.10.0>`__.

.. _version-4.9:

What's New in 4.9
-----------------

New features of the 4.9 {+driver-short+} release include:

- Fixed an inconsistency with ``writeConcern`` options in the type definitions.
- Included the latest BSON release, which adds automatic UUID support. See the
  BSON release notes `here <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v4.7.0>`__.

To learn more, see `v4.9.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.9.0>`__.

.. _version-4.8:

What's New in 4.8
-----------------

.. important:: Upgrade from v4.8.0 to v4.8.1

   Version 4.8.1 fixes a type regression issue introduced in v4.8.0. By
   upgrading to v4.8.1, you can specify ``_id`` values and sub-documents
   when performing updates with the ``$set`` or ``$setOnInsert`` operators.

New features of the 4.8 {+driver-short+} release include:

- Added auto-completion and type safety for nested keys in an update filter
- ``client.startSession()`` can now be called before connecting to MongoDB
- ``estimatedDocumentCount()`` method can now accept a comment

To learn more, see `v4.8.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.8.0>`__.

.. _version-4.7:

What's New in 4.7
-----------------

New features of the 4.7 {+driver-short+} release include:

- The ``MongoClient.connect()`` method is now optional when connecting to your MongoDB instance
- Ability to  compress messages with the ``Zstandard`` :ref:`compression algorithm <node-network-compression>`
- Added support for the ``maxConnecting`` connection option
- Ability for change stream documents to show your documents before and after an update
- Added support for new change stream fields related to Cluster to Cluster Replication
- The ``estimatedDocumentCount()`` method now uses the ``$count`` database command
- Improved connecting to MongoDB in the AWS Lambda Init phase

.. important:: Deprecation Notice

    The ``ResumeOptions`` interface is deprecated. Use the
    ``ChangeStreamCursorOptions`` interface instead.

.. _version-4.6:

What's New in 4.6
-----------------

New features of the 4.6 Node.js driver release include:

- Improved the ``ChangeStreamDocument`` in TypeScript.
- Even distribution of server selection based on load across servers.

To learn more, see `v4.6.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.6.0>`__.

.. _version-4.5:

What's New in 4.5
-----------------

See `v4.5.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.5.0>`__
on GitHub.


.. _version-4.4:

What's New in 4.4
-----------------

New features of the 4.4 Node.js driver release include:

- KMIP provider support when using CSFLE.
- TLS support when using CSFLE.
- Hostname canonicalization now accepts "none", "forward", and "forwardAndReverse" as ``authMechanismProperties`` when using GSSAPI.
- In the 4.0.0 release of the driver, the deprecated ``collection.count()`` method was inadvertently changed to behave like ``collection.countDocuments()``.
  In this release, the ``collection.count()`` method is updated to match legacy behavior:

  - If a query is provided, ``collection.count()`` behaves the same as ``collection.countDocuments()`` and performs a collection scan.
  - If no query is  provided, ``collection.count()`` behaves the same as ``collection.estimatedDocumentCount()`` and relies on
    collection metadata.

  .. important:: Deprecation Notice

     The ``cursor.count()`` method is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version, along with ``collection.count()``.
     Use the ``collection.estimatedDocumentCount()`` or ``collection.countDocuments()``
     methods instead.

.. _version-4.3:

What's New in 4.3
-----------------

New features of the 4.3 Node.js driver release include:

- SOCKS5 support
- Option to :ref:`disable UTF-8 validation <nodejs-utf-8-validation>`
- Type inference for nested documents

.. _version-4.2:

What's New in 4.2
-----------------

New features of the 4.2 Node.js driver release include:

- ``srvMaxHosts`` and ``srvServiceName`` DNS seedlist :ref:`connection options <node-connection-options>`

.. _version-4.1:

What's New in 4.1
-----------------

New features of the 4.1 Node.js driver release include:

- Added load balanced connection support for all cluster types including
  the beta :ref:`Serverless platform <create-new-database-deployment>`.
- Added support for the ``advanceClusterTime()`` method to determine if
  the ``ClientSession`` should update its cluster time.

.. _version-4.0:

What's New in 4.0
-----------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes in v4.0

   This driver version introduces breaking changes. For a list of these changes, see
   the :ref:`Version 4.0 Breaking Changes section <node-breaking-changes-v4.0>` in
   the Upgrade guide.

New features of the 4.0 Node.js driver release include:

.. important::

   In this release of the driver, the deprecated ``collection.count()`` method was
   inadvertently changed to behave like ``collection.countDocuments()``. This behavior
   is corrected in :ref:`version 4.4 <version-4.4>`.


TypeScript
~~~~~~~~~~

- We've migrated the driver to TypeScript. You can now harness the type
  hinting and intellisense features in editors that support it to develop
  your MongoDB applications. Enjoy the benefits of this work in pure JavaScript
  projects as well.

- The underlying BSON library used by this version is now migrated to
  TypeScript.

- Inline documentation is now consistently formatted to improve display
  in editors.

- If you are a user of the community types ``@types/mongodb``, there will
  **likely be issues** adopting the types from our codebase. We could not
  achieve a one to one match in types due to the details of writing the
  codebase in TypeScript.

We'd love to hear your TypeScript related feature requests. Please submit
ideas on our `JIRA project here <https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/NODE>`__.

Key Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Node.js Version
```````````````

The minimum supported version of Node.js is now v12.9 or greater for
version 4 of the driver. Support for our 3.x branches will continue
until mid-year 2022 to allow time for users to upgrade.

.. note::

   3.x supports back to Node.js v4.


Cursor Improvements
```````````````````

Our Cursor implementation is now updated to make it clear what is possible
before and after execution of an operation.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: js
      :copyable: False

      const fc = myColl.find({a: 2.3}).skip(1)
      for await (const doc of fc) {
        console.log(doc)
        fc.limit(1) // incorrect usage, cursor already executing
      }

There was inconsistency surrounding how the cursor would error if a
setting was applied after cursor execution began. Now, the cursor will
throw an error when attempting to apply operations in an invalid state,
similar to the following:

``MongoError: Cursor is already initialized``

- Affected classes:

  - ``AbstractCursor``
  - ``FindCursor``
  - ``AggregationCursor``
  - ``ChangeStreamCursor`` (This is the underlying cursor for ``ChangeStream``)
  - ``ListCollectionsCursor``

Cursor Stream API
+++++++++++++++++

Our Cursor types no longer extend ``Readable`` directly. They must be
transformed into a stream by calling ``cursor.stream()``.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: js
      :copyable: False

      const cursor = myColl.find({});
      const stream = cursor.stream();
      stream.on("data", data => console.log);
      stream.on("error", () => client.close());

Use ``hasNext()`` and ``next()`` for manual iteration.
Use ``for await of`` syntax or any ``Promise`` helpers for
asynchronous iteration.

``MongoClientOptions`` Interface
````````````````````````````````

With type hinting, you should find that options passed to a ``MongoClient``
are enumerated and discoverable. We've made a large effort to process
all options in the driver to give early warnings about incompatible settings
to get your app up and running in a correct state quickly.

- ``checkServerIdentity`` is no longer checked before being passed to the
  underlying Node API. Previously, accepted values were ``false``, or
  a function. Now, the argument must be a function. Specifying a
  boolean will result in an error being thrown.

- It is no longer required to specify ``useUnifiedTopology`` or ``useNewUrlParser``.

``createCollection()``
``````````````````````

This method no longer supports a ``strict`` option, which returned
an error if the collection did not exist. To assert the existence of
a collection, use the ``listCollections()`` method instead.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: js

      const collections = (await db.listCollections({}, { nameOnly: true })
        .toArray()).map(
          ({name}) => name
        );
      if (!collections.includes(myNewCollectionName)) {
        throw new Error(`${myNewCollectionName} doesn't exist`);
      }

``BulkWriteError`` → ``MongoBulkWriteError``
````````````````````````````````````````````

``BulkWriteError`` is now renamed to ``MongoBulkWriteError``.

When running bulk operations that make writes you can encounter errors
depending on your settings. Import the new class name ``MongoBulkWriteError``
when testing for errors in bulk operations.

``DB``
``````

``DB`` is no longer an ``EventEmitter``. Listen for events directly from your
``MongoClient`` instance.

``Collection.group()``
``````````````````````

The ``Collection.group()`` helper, deprecated since MongoDB 3.4,
is now removed. Use the aggregation pipeline :manual:`$group </reference/operator/aggregation/group/#pipe._S_group>`
operator instead.

Authentication
``````````````

- ``gssapiServiceName`` is now removed. Use `authMechanismProperties.SERVICE_NAME <{+api+}/interfaces/MongoClientOptions.html#authMechanismProperties>`__ in the URI or as an option on ``MongoClientOptions``.

  .. example::

     .. code-block:: js

        ?authMechanismProperties.SERVICE_NAME
        // or
        new MongoClient(url, { SERVICE_NAME: "alternateServiceName" })

- Specifying username and password as options is only supported in the URI
  or as an option on ``MongoClientOptions``.

  .. example::

     .. code-block:: js

        new MongoClient("mongodb://username:password@<host><port>")
        // or
        new MongoClient(url, { auth: { username: "<>", password: "<>" } })

``GridStore`` Removal
`````````````````````

The GridStore API (already deprecated in 3.x) is now replaced with ``GridFSBucket``.
For more information on ``GridFS``, see the :manual:`mongodb manual </core/gridfs>`.

Below are some snippets that represent equivalent operations.

Construction
++++++++++++

.. example::

   .. code-block:: javascript

      // old way
      const gs = new GridStore(db, filename, mode[, options])
      // new way
      const bucket = new GridFSBucket(client.db('test')[,options])

File Seeking
++++++++++++

GridFSBucket uses the Node.js Stream API. You can replicate file seeking
by using the ``start`` and ``end`` options, creating a download stream
from your ``GridFSBucket``.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: js

      bucket.openDownloadStreamByName(filename, { start: 0, end: 100 })

File Upload & Download
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. example::

   .. code-block:: javascript

      await client.connect();
      const filename = 'test.txt'; // whatever local file name you want
      const db = client.db();
      const bucket = new GridFSBucket(db);

      fs.createReadStream(filename)
        .pipe(bucket.openUploadStream(filename))
        .on('error', console.error)
        .on('finish', () => {
          console.log('done writing to db!');

          bucket
            .find()
            .toArray()
            .then(files => {
              console.log(files);

              bucket
                .openDownloadStreamByName(filename)
                .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('downloaded_' + filename))
                .on('error', console.error)
                .on('finish', () => {
                  console.log('done downloading!');
                  client.close();
                });
            });
        });

.. note::

   ``GridFSBucket`` does not need to be closed like ``GridStore``.

File Deletion
+++++++++++++

.. example::

   .. code-block:: js

      // old way
      GridStore.unlink(db, name, callback);
      // new way
      bucket.delete(file_id);

Finding File Metadata
+++++++++++++++++++++

File metadata that used to be accessible on the ``GridStore`` instance can be
found by querying the bucket.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: js

      const fileMetaDataList: GridFSFile[] = bucket.find({}).toArray();

Unified Topology
````````````````

- We internally now only manage a ``unifiedTopology`` when you connect
  to a ``mongod``. The differences between this and previous versions
  is `detailed here <https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/reference/unified-topology/>`__.

- It is no longer required to specify ``useUnifiedTopology`` or ``useNewUrlParser``.

- You must use the new ``directConnection`` `option <{+api+}/interfaces/MongoClientOptions.html#directConnection>`__
  to connect to uninitialized replica set members.

Explain
```````

Support is now added for fine-grained verbosity modes. You can learn more
about each mode :manual:`here </reference/method/cursor.explain/#behavior/>`.

Command Monitoring
``````````````````

The ``instrument()`` method is now removed. Use command monitoring instead.
See our guide on :doc:`command monitoring </fundamentals/monitoring/command-monitoring>`
for more information.
