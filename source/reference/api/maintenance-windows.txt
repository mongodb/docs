Maintenance Windows
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The ``maintenanceWindow`` resource provides access to retrieve or
update the current |service| project maintenance window. To learn more
about Maintenance Windows, see the
:guilabel:`Set Preferred Cluster Maintenance Start Time` setting on
the :ref:`View/Modify Project Settings page <atlas-modify-project-settings>`.

.. note::

   |service| performs maintenance the same way as the
   :manual:`manual maintenance procedure
   </tutorial/perform-maintence-on-replica-set-members/>`.
   This requires at least one
   :manual:`replica set election </core/replica-set-elections>` during
   the maintenance window per replica set.

You can :doc:`defer a scheduled maintenance event
</reference/api/maintenance-window-defer>` for a project up to two
times. Deferred maintenance events occur during your
:ref:`preferred maintenance window <atlas-modify-project-settings>`
exactly one week after the previously scheduled date and time.
