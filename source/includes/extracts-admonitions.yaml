      - **UI Design Updates**
      - **Navigation Enhancements**:

        - The :guilabel:`Settings` view in the left-hand navigation bar
          now contains only the group-level settings. To access
          user-specific settings, click on your user name in the
          upper-right hand corner and select :guilabel:`Account`.

        - The :guilabel:`Users` view (i.e. |service| users who belong
          to the group, i.e. not the MongoDB users) is now available
          directly from the left-hand navigation bar.

      - **New Feature**: Ability to :ref:`rename Group <group-settings-page>` by the Group owner.

      - **New Feature**: :doc:`Data Explorer view <data-explorer>` provides the ability to introspect collections.

      - **New Feature**: :doc:`Queryable Backup </tutorial/query-backup>` is available.
