SQL to Aggregation Framework
----------------------------

With the :doc:`/applications/aggregation`, MongoDB provides analogous
functionality to common SQL aggregation functions.

COUNT(*)
~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides three ways to perform the SQL operation of ``count(*)``:

- the :dbcommand:`count()` command
- the :method:`count() <cursor.count()>` method
- the :agg:pipeline:`$group` operator in conjunction with the
  :agg:expression:`$sum` operator in the
  :doc:`/applications/aggregation`.

Consider the following SQL command which performs a count of the rows
in the ``orders`` table:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT COUNT(*) AS count 
   FROM orders

In MongoDB,

- the analogous query using the :dbcommand:`count()` command is:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   db.orders.count()
    
- the analogous query using the :method:`count() <cursor.count()>`
  method is:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 1
   
   db.orders.find().count()

- the analogous query using the :doc:`/applications/aggregation` is:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 1
   
   db.orders.aggregate( [ { $group: { _id: null, count: { $sum: 1 } } } ] )

The :doc:`/applications/aggregation` query performs a
:agg:pipeline:`$group` operation that uses the :agg:expression:`$sum`
operator to calculate the ``count`` with no grouping. Within the :agg:pipeline:`$group`
operation, the :agg:expression:`$sum` operator calculates the ``count``
by adding ``1`` for each document in the ``orders`` collection as grouped by ``null``.

SUM(<column>)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides aggregation :agg:expression:`$sum` operator to perform the
SQL operation of ``sum(<column>)``.

Consider the following SQL command which sums the ``price`` column in
the ``orders`` table:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT SUM(price) AS total 
   FROM orders

In MongoDB, the analogous query using the
:doc:`/applications/aggregation` is:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 1
   
   db.orders.aggregate( [ { $group: { _id: null, total: { $sum: "$price" } } } ] )

The :doc:`/applications/aggregation` query performs a
:agg:pipeline:`$group` operation that uses the :agg:expression:`$sum`
operator to calculate the ``total`` on the ``price`` field grouped by
``null`` (i.e. with no grouping.) 

Note the ``$`` in front of the field ``price`` as it appears as an
operand to the aggregation operators.

GROUP BY(<column>...)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides aggregation :agg:expression:`$group` operator to perform the
SQL operation of ``GROUP BY ()``.

*Grouping by single column*

Consider the following SQL command which groups the ``price`` information by
``cust_id``:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT cust_id, SUM(price) AS total
   FROM orders 
   GROUP BY cust_id

In MongoDB, the analogous query using the
:doc:`/applications/aggregation` is:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 1
   
   db.orders.aggregate( [ { $group: { _id: "$cust_id" , total: { $sum: "$price" } } } ] )

The :doc:`/applications/aggregation` query performs a
:agg:pipeline:`$group` operation that uses the :agg:expression:`$sum`
operator to calculate the ``total`` on the ``price`` field as grouped
by the ``cust_id`` field. 

Note the ``$`` in front of the fields ``cust_id`` and ``price`` as they
appear as operands to the aggregation operators.

*Grouping by multiple columns*

Consider the following SQL command which groups the ``price``
information by both ``cust_id`` and ``ord_date``:

.. code-block:: sql
   
   SELECT cust_id, ord_date, SUM(price) AS total
   FROM orders 
   GROUP BY cust_id, ord_date

In MongoDB, the analogous query using the
:doc:`/applications/aggregation` is:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 1
   
   db.orders.aggregate( [ { $group: { _id: { cust_id: "$cust_id", ord_date: "$ord_date" }, total: { $sum: "$price" } } } ] )

The :doc:`/applications/aggregation` query performs the
:agg:pipeline:`$group` operation that uses the :agg:expression:`$sum`
operator to calculate the ``total`` on the ``price`` field as grouped
by the ``cust_id`` and ``ord_date`` fields. 

Note the ``$`` in front of the fields ``cust_id``, ``ord_date``, and
``price`` as they appear as operands to the aggregation operators.

GROUP BY ... HAVING ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides aggregation :agg:expression:`$group` and
:agg:expression:`$match` operators to perform the SQL operation of
``GROUP BY ... HAVING ...``.

*Grouping by single column ... having*

Consider the following SQL command which can be used to find the
``cust_id`` 's with multiple rows:

.. code-block:: sql
   
   SELECT cust_id, count(*)
   FROM orders 
   GROUP BY cust_id
   HAVING count(*) > 1

In MongoDB, the analogous query using the
:doc:`/applications/aggregation` is:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2-3
   
   db.orders.aggregate( [ 
                           { $group: { _id: "$cust_id", count: { $sum: 1 } } }, 
                           { $match: { count: { $gt: 1 } } } 
                        ] )

The :doc:`/applications/aggregation` query first performs a
:agg:pipeline:`$group` operation that uses the :agg:expression:`$sum`
operator to calculate the ``count`` of the documents grouped by
``cust_id``. Then the query pipes the results to the
:agg:expression:`$match` operator that returns only those results that
have ``count`` greater than ``1``. 

Note the ``$`` in front of the fields ``cust_id`` as it appear as an
operand to the aggregation operators.

*Grouping by multiple columns ... having*

Consider the following SQL command which can be used to find the
calculated column ``total`` greater than ``250`` grouped by ``cust_id`` and
``ord_date``:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT cust_id, ord_date, SUM(price) AS total
   FROM orders 
   GROUP BY cust_id, ord_date
   HAVING total > 250

In MongoDB, the analogous query using the
:doc:`/applications/aggregation` is:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2-3
   
   db.orders.aggregate( [ 
                           { $group: { _id: { cust_id: "$cust_id", ord_date: "$ord_date" }, total: { $sum: "$price" } } },
                           { $match: { total: { $gt: 250 } } } 
                        ] )

The :doc:`/applications/aggregation` query first performs a
:agg:pipeline:`$group` operation that uses the :agg:expression:`$sum`
operator to calculate the ``total`` on the ``price`` field as grouped
by the ``cust_id`` and ``ord_date`` fields. Then the query pipes the
results to the :agg:expression:`$match` operator that returns only
those results that have ``total`` greater than ``250``. 

Note the ``$`` in front of the fields ``cust_id``, ``ord_date``, and
``price`` as they appear as operands to the aggregation operators.

WHERE ... GROUP BY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MongoDB provides aggregation :agg:expression:`$group` and
:agg:expression:`$match` operators to perform the SQL operation of
``WHERE ... GROUP BY``.

Consider the following SQL command which can be used to find the
``cust_id`` and the calculated column ``total`` for orders with status
``A`` grouped by ``cust_id``:

.. code-block:: sql
   
   SELECT cust_id, SUM(price) as total
   FROM orders 
   WHERE status = 'A'
   GROUP BY cust_id

In MongoDB, the analogous query using the
:doc:`/applications/aggregation` is:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2-3
   
   db.orders.aggregate( [ 
                           { $match: { status: 'A' } },
                           { $group: { _id: "$cust_id", total: { $sum: "$price" } } } 
                        ] )

The :doc:`/applications/aggregation` query first performs a
:agg:expression:`$match` operation that returns only those documents
that have ``status`` field equal to ``A``. Then the query pipes the
results to the :agg:pipeline:`$group` operation that uses the
:agg:expression:`$sum` operator to calculate the ``total`` on the
``price`` field as grouped by the ``cust_id`` field.

Note the ``$`` in front of the fields ``cust_id``, ``ord_date``, and
``price`` as they appear as operands to the aggregation operators.

WHERE ... GROUP BY ... HAVING ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides aggregation :agg:expression:`$group` and
:agg:expression:`$match` operators to perform the SQL operation of
``WHERE ... GROUP BY ... HAVIN``.

Consider the following SQL command which can be used to find the
``cust_id`` and the calculated column ``total`` for orders with status
``A`` grouped by ``cust_id`` having ``total`` greater than ``250``:

.. code-block:: sql
   
   SELECT cust_id, SUM(price) as total
   FROM orders 
   WHERE status = 'A'
   GROUP BY cust_id
   HAVING total > 250

In MongoDB, the analogous query using the
:doc:`/applications/aggregation` is:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2-4
   
   db.orders.aggregate( [ 
                           { $match: { status: 'A' } },
                           { $group: { _id: "$cust_id", total: { $sum: "$price" } } } ,
                           { $match: { total: { $gt: 250 } } } 
                        ] )

The :doc:`/applications/aggregation` query first performs a
:agg:expression:`$match` operation that returns only those documents
that have ``status`` field equal to ``A``. Then the query pipes the
results to the :agg:pipeline:`$group` operation that uses the
:agg:expression:`$sum` operator to calculate the ``total`` on the
``price`` field as grouped by the ``cust_id`` field. Finally the query
pipes those results to the :agg:expression:`$match` operator that
returns only those results that have ``total`` greater than ``250``.

Note the ``$`` in front of the fields ``cust_id``, ``ord_date``, and
``price`` as they appear as operands to the aggregation operators.
