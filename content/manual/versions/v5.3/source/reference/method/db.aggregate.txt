.. method:: db.aggregate()

   Runs a specified admin/diagnostic pipeline which does not require an 
   underlying collection. For aggregations on collection data, see
   :method:`db.collection.aggregate()`.

   The :method:`db.aggregate()` method has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.aggregate( [ <pipeline> ], { <options> } )

   - The ``pipeline`` parameter is an array of stages to execute. It
     must start with a compatible stage that does not require an
     underlying collection, such as :pipeline:`$currentOp` or 
     :pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`.

   - The ``options`` document can contain the following fields and values:


     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 20 20 80
     
        * - Field
     
          - Type
     
          - Description
     
        * - ``explain``
     
          - boolean
     
          - Optional. Specifies to return the information on the processing of the pipeline. See
            :ref:`example-aggregate-method-explain-option` for an example.
            
            Not available in :doc:`multi-document transactions </core/transactions>`.
            
            
     
        * - ``allowDiskUse``
     
          - boolean
     
          - Optional. Enables writing to temporary files. When set to ``true``, aggregation
            operations can write data to the :file:`_tmp` subdirectory in the
            :setting:`~storage.dbPath` directory. See
            :ref:`example-aggregate-method-external-sort` for an example.
            
            .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-usedDisk.rst
            
            
     
        * - ``cursor``
     
          - document
     
          - Optional. Specifies the *initial* batch size for the cursor. The value of the ``cursor``
            field is a document with the field ``batchSize``. See
            :ref:`example-aggregate-method-initial-batch-size` for syntax and example.

     
        * - ``maxTimeMS``
     
          - non-negative integer
     
          - Optional. Specifies a time limit in milliseconds for processing
            operations on a cursor. If you do not specify a value for maxTimeMS,
            operations will not time out. A value of ``0`` explicitly
            specifies the default unbounded behavior.
            
            MongoDB terminates operations that exceed their allotted time limit
            using the same mechanism as :method:`db.killOp()`. MongoDB only
            terminates an operation at one of its designated :term:`interrupt 
            points <interrupt point>`.
            
            
     
        * - ``bypassDocumentValidation``
     
          - boolean
     
          - Optional. Applicable only if you specify the :pipeline:`$out` or :pipeline:`$merge` aggregation
            stages.
            
            
            
            Enables :method:`db.collection.aggregate` to bypass document validation
            during the operation. This lets you insert documents that do not
            meet the validation requirements.
            
            
     
        * - ``readConcern``
     
          - document
     
          - Optional. Specifies the :term:`read concern`.
            
            .. include:: /includes/fact-readConcern-syntax.rst
            
            .. include:: /includes/fact-readConcern-option-description.rst
            
            .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-out-linearizable.rst
            
            .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-linearizable-merge-restriction.rst
            
            
     
        * - ``collation``
     
          - document
     
          - Optional. 
            
            .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-option.rst
            
            
     
        * - ``hint``
     
          - string or document
     
          - Optional. The index to use for the aggregation. The index is on the initial
            collection/view against which the aggregation is run.
            
            Specify the index either by the index name or by the index
            specification document.
            
            .. note::
            
               The ``hint`` does not apply to :pipeline:`$lookup` and
               :pipeline:`$graphLookup` stages.
            
            
     
        * - ``comment``
     
          - string
     
          - Optional. Users can specify an arbitrary string to help trace the operation 
            through the database profiler, currentOp, and logs.
            
            
     
        * - ``writeConcern``
     
          - document
     
          - Optional. A document that expresses the :doc:`write concern </reference/write-concern>`
            to use with the :pipeline:`$out` or :pipeline:`$merge` stage. 
            
            Omit to use the default write concern with the :pipeline:`$out` or
            :pipeline:`$merge` stage.
            
            
     


Example
-------

.. _admin-pipeline-currentOp:

Pipeline with ``$currentOp``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example runs a pipeline with two stages. The first stage 
runs the :pipeline:`$currentOp` operation and the second stage filters the
results of that operation. 

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.aggregate( [ { 
      $currentOp : { allUsers: true, idleConnections: true } }, { 
      $match : { shard: "shard01" } 
      }
   ] )
