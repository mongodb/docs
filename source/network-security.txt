{+service+} provides secure network configuration defaults for your
database deployments, such as:

- Mandatory |tls-ssl| connection encryption
- {+vpc+}\s for all projects with one-or-more {+Dedicated-clusters+}
- Authentication that uses {+ip-access-list+}s and only accepts connections
  from sources you explicitly declare

You can further configure these protections to meet your unique security
needs and preferences.

Use the recommendations on this page to plan for the network security
configuration of your {+clusters+}.

{+service+} Features and Recommendations for Network Security
-------------------------------------------------------------

{+service+} enforces |tls-ssl| encryption for all connections to your
databases.

We recommend using M10+ dedicated {+clusters+} because all {+service+} projects with one or more M10+ dedicated {+clusters+} receive
their own dedicated |vpc| on {+aws+} or {+gcp+} (or {+vnet+} if you use |azure|).
{+service+} deploys all dedicated clusters inside this |vpc| or {+vnet+}.

By default, all access to your {+clusters+} is blocked. You must explicitly allow 
an inbound connection by one of the following methods:

- Add public IP addresses to your {+ip-access-list+}.
- Use |vpc| / {+vnet+} peering to add private IP addresses.
- Add private endpoints, which {+service+} adds automatically to your {+ip-access-list+}. 
  No other access is automatically added.

You can also use multiple methods together for added security.

Features
~~~~~~~~

|tls|
```````````

{+service+} enforces mandatory |tls| encryption of connections to your
databases. |tls| 1.2 is the default protocol; you can select |tls| 1.1
or |tls| 1.0 if necessary, but we do not recommend protocols lower than 
the default. To learn more, see the
:guilabel:`Set Minimum TLS Protocol Version` section of
:ref:`Configure Additional Settings
<create-cluster-additional-settings>`.

{+ip-access-list+}s
```````````````````````````````

As a |service| administrator, you can:

You can configure {+ip-access-list+}s to limit which IP addresses can
attempt authentication to your database.

Your {+service+} {+clusters+} allow access only from the IP addresses
and |cidr| block IP ranges that you add to your {+ip-access-list+}.
Application servers and other clients can't access your {+service+}
{+clusters+} if their IP addresses aren't included in your {+ip-access-list+}.

You can configure :atlas:`temporary access list entries
</security/ip-access-list/#add-ip-access-list-entries>`
that expire automatically after a user-defined period.

You can create one access list per project.

Firewall Configuration
``````````````````````

When connecting from your client application servers to {+service+} and passing 
through a firewall that blocks outbound network connections, you must also configure 
your firewall to allow your applications to make outbound connections to TCP traffic 
on {+service+} hosts. This grants your applications access to your {+clusters+}.

{+service+} {+cluster+} public IPs remain the same in the majority of
cases of {+cluster+} changes such as :ref:`vertical scaling
<sizing-auto-scaling>`,
:atlas:`topology </reference/glossary/#std-term-topology>` changes, or
:ref:`maintenance events <configure-maintenance-window>`. However,
certain topology changes, such as a :ref:`conversion from replica set
to sharded cluster <scale-cluster-sharding>`, the
:ref:`addition of shards <scale-cluster-shardNum>`, or a :ref:`region
change <scale-cluster-region>` require that you use new IP addresses.

VPC/{+vnet+} Peering
`````````````````````````````

Network peering allows you to connect your own |vpc|\s with |a-service|
|vpc| to route traffic privately and isolate your data flow from the
public Internet. {+service+} maps |vpc|\s one-to-one to {+service+} projects.

Most operations performed over a |vpc| connection originate from your
application environment, minimizing the need for {+service+} to make
outbound access requests to peer |vpc|\s. However, if you configure {+service+}
to use |ldap| authentication, you must enable {+service+} to
connect outbound to the authentication endpoint of your peer |vpc| over the |ldap|
protocol.

You can choose your {+service+} |cidr| block with the |vpc| peering wizard
before you deploy your first {+cluster+}. The {+service+} |vpc| |cidr|
block must not overlap with the |cidr| block of any |vpc| you intend to
peer to. {+service+} limits the number of MongoDB instances per |vpc|
based on the |cidr| block. For example, a project with a |cidr| block of
``/24`` is limited to the equivalent of 273-node replica sets.

Private Endpoints
`````````````````

A private endpoint facilitates a one-way connection from your own |vpc|
to your {+service+} |vpc|, without permitting {+service+} to initiate a
reciprocal connection. This allows you to make use of secure connections
to {+service+} without extending your network trust boundary. The following
private endpoints are available:

- {+aws+} :aws:`PrivateLink </vpc/latest/userguide/endpoint-services-overview.html>`,
  for connections from {+aws+} |vpc|\s
- {+azure+} :azure:`Private Link </private-link/private-link-overview>`,
  for connections from {+azure+} {+vnet+}s
- :gcp:`Private Service Connect </vpc/docs/private-service-connect>`, for
  connections from {+gcp+}

Recommendations for Private Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend that you set up private endpoints for all new staging and production projects to limit the extension of your network trust
boundary.

In general, we recommend using private endpoints for every {+service+} project 
because it provides the most granular security and eases the administrative burden 
that can come from managing {+ip-access-list+}\s and large blocks of IP addresses 
as your cloud network scales. There is a cost associated with each endpoint, so you 
might consider not requiring private endpoints in lower environments but you should 
leverage them in higher environments to limit the extension of your network trust 
boundary.

To learn more about private endpoints
in {+service+}, including limitations and considerations, see :atlas:`Learn About Private Endpoints in {+service+} </security-private-endpoint/>`. To learn how to set up private
endpoints for your {+clusters+}, see
:atlas:`Set Up a Private Endpoint for a Dedicated Cluster </security-cluster-private-endpoint/>`.

Recommendations for IP Access Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend that you configure an {+ip-access-list+} for your API keys and programmatic 
access to allow access only from trusted IP addresses such as your CI/CD pipeline 
or orchestration system. These {+ip-access-list+}\s are set on the {+service+} 
control plane upon provisioning a service account and are separate from {+ip-access-list+}\s
which can be set on the {+service+} project data plane for connections to the {+clusters+}. 

When you configure your {+ip-access-list+}, we recommend that you:

- Use temporary access list entries in situations where team members
  require access to your environment from temporary work locations or during 
  break-glass scenarios where production access to humans is required to resolve 
  a production-down scenario. We recommend that you build an automation script to 
  quickly add temporary access to prepare for these incidents.
- Define {+ip-access-list+} entries covering the smallest network segments
  possible. To do this, favor individual IP addresses where possible,
  and avoid large |cidr| blocks.

Recommendations for VPC/{+vnet+} Peering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you configure |vpc| or {+vnet+} peering, we recommend that you:

- To maintain tight network trust boundaries, configure security groups
  and :aws:`network ACLs </vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html>`
  to prevent inbound access to systems inside your application |vpc|\s
  from the {+service+}-side |vpc|.
  
- Create new |vpc|\s to act as intermediaries between sensitive
  application infrastructure and your {+service+} |vpc|\s. |vpc|\s are
  intransitive, allowing you to only expose those components of your
  application that need access to {+service+}.

Examples
--------

The following examples configure connections between your application
environment and your {+service+} {+clusters+} using {+ip-access-list+}s,
|vpc| Peering, and Private Endpoints.
