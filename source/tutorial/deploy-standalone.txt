You can deploy a :term:`standalone` MongoDB instance for |mms| to 
manage. Use standalone instances for testing and development.
**Do not** use these deployments for production systems as they lack 
replication and high availability. For all production deployments
use replica sets. To learn about replica sets, see 
:doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set`.
