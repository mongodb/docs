Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about how the {+driver-short+} manages clusters.

You can specify settings for your clusters by using either a :ref:`connection
string <connection-uri>` or by passing a ``MongoClientSettings`` object to the 
:ref:`MongoClient <mongoclient>` constructor. Select the :guilabel:`Connection
String` or :guilabel:`MongoClientSettings` tab to see the options available:


.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Connection String
    :tabid: uri

    Include the following parameters in your connection string to modify the driver's behavior when interacting with your MongoDB cluster:

    .. list-table:: 
       :header-rows: 1 
       :widths: 25,20,60

       * - Option Name
         - Type
         - Description
        
       * - ``serverSelectionTimeoutMS``
         - integer
         - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the driver
           waits for server selection to succeed before throwing an
           exception. 
            
           *Default*: ``30000`` (30 seconds)
        
       * - ``localThresholdMS``
         - integer
         - When communicating with multiple instances of MongoDB in a replica
           set, the driver sends requests only to a server whose response
           time is less than or equal to the server with the fastest response
           time plus the local threshold, in milliseconds.  
            
           *Default*: ``15``
       * - ``replicaSet``
         - string
         - Specifies that the :ref:`connection string <connection-uri>`
           provided includes multiple hosts. When specified, the driver
           attempts to find all members of that set. 
            
           *Default*: ``null``
        
       * - ``directConnection``
         - boolean
         - Specifies that the driver must connect to the host directly. This
           maps to applying ``mode(ClusterConnectionMode.SINGLE)`` to your
           ``MongoClientSettings``. 
            
           *Default*: ``false``
        
       * - ``srvServiceName``
         - string
         - Specifies the service name of the `SRV resource records
           <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2782>`__ the driver retrieves to
           construct your :manual:`seed list
           </reference/glossary/#std-term-seed-list>`. You must use the
           :manual:`DNS Seed List Connection Format
           </reference/connection-string/#dns-seed-list-connection-format>` in
           your :ref:`connection URI <connection-uri>` to use this option.  
            
           *Default*: ``mongodb``
    
    This example connects the driver directly to a server,
    regardless of the type of MongoDB cluster it's a part of:

    .. code-block:: java

      ConnectionString connectionString = "mongodb://<host>:<port>/?directConnection=true"
      MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(connectionString)
    
    For more information about these parameters, see the `ConnectionString
    <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/ConnectionString.html>`__
    API documentation.

  .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
    :tabid: MongoClient

    Chain the `applyToClusterSettings()
    <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToClusterSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
    method to modify the driver's behavior when interacting with your MongoDB
    cluster.

    The following table describes the methods you can chain to your
    settings to modify the driver's behavior:

    .. list-table::
       :header-rows: 1
       :stub-columns: 1
       :widths: 40 60

       * - Method
         - Description

       * - ``addClusterListener()``
         - Adds a listener for cluster-related events.

       * - ``applyConnectionString()``
         - Uses the settings from a ``ConnectionString`` object.

       * - ``applySettings()``
         - Uses the cluster settings specified in a ``ClusterSettings`` object.

       * - ``hosts()``
         - Sets all the specified locations of a Mongo deployment.

       * - ``localThreshold()``
         - Sets the amount of time that a serverâ€™s round trip can take and
           still be eligible for server selection.
           
           *Default*: ``15 milliseconds``

       * - ``mode()``
         - Sets how to connect to a MongoDB deployment.

       * - ``requiredClusterType()``
         - Sets the type of cluster required for the cluster.

       * - ``requiredReplicaSetName()``
         - Sets the replica set name required for the cluster.

       * - ``serverSelectionTimeout()``
         - Sets the maximum time to select a primary node before throwing a
           timeout exception.  
           
           *Default*: ``30 seconds``

       * - ``serverSelector()``
         - Adds a server selector to apply before server selection.

       * - ``srvHost()``
         - Sets the host name to use to look up an SRV DNS record to find the MongoDB hosts.  
            
           If you want to enable the processing of TXT records associated with the host, specify the SRV host in the connection string using the ``applyConnectionString()`` method.   
           
           For example:
                
           .. code-block:: java
              :emphasize-lines: 3

              MongoClient mongoClient = 
                MongoClients.create(MongoClientSettings.builder()
                  .applyConnectionString(new ConnectionString("mongodb+srv://host1.acme.com")))

       * - ``srvMaxHosts()``
         - Sets the maximum number of hosts the driver can connect to when
           using the DNS seedlist (SRV) connection protocol, identified by
           the ``mongodb+srv`` connection string prefix.  
           
           Throws an exception if you are not using the SRV connection protocol.

    This example connects the driver directly to a server,
    regardless of the type of MongoDB cluster it's a part of:

    .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MCSettings.java
        :start-after: begin ClusterSettings
        :end-before: end ClusterSettings
        :language: java
        :emphasize-lines: 3-4
        :dedent:

    .. tip::

       This is analogous to the ``directConnection`` parameter you can specify
       in your connection URI. See the Connection String tab for more
       information.

    For more information about the chained methods, see the `MongoClientSettings.Builder
    <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html>`__
    API documentation.
