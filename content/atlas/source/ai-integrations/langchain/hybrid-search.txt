You can integrate MongoDB with LangChain
to perform :ref:`hybrid search <as_hybrid-search>`. 
In this tutorial, you complete the following steps:

#. Set up the environment.
#. Use MongoDB as a vector store.
#. Create a {+avs+} and |fts| index on your data.
#. Run hybrid search queries.
#. Pass the query results into your |rag| pipeline.

   Work with a runnable version of this tutorial as a :github:`Python notebook <mongodb/docs-notebooks/blob/main/ai-integrations/langchain-hybrid-search.ipynb>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial, you must have the following:

.. include:: /includes/avs/shared/avs-python-voyage-openai-prerequisites.rst

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/note-python-version-langchain-voyageai.rst

Set Up the Environment
----------------------

.. include:: /includes/avs/shared/set-up-python-notebook-environment.rst

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/set-up-environment-hybrid-search.rst

Use MongoDB as a Vector Store
-----------------------------

You must use MongoDB as a vector store for your data.
You can instantiate a vector store by using an
existing collection in MongoDB.

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/create-vector-store-hybrid-search.rst

.. tip::

   `MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch API Reference <https://langchain-mongodb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/langchain_mongodb/vectorstores/langchain_mongodb.vectorstores.MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch.html>`__

Create the Indexes
------------------

To enable hybrid search queries on your vector store,
create a {+avs+} and |fts| index on the collection.
You can create the indexes by using either the 
LangChain helper methods or the 
:driver:`PyMongo Driver </pymongo/>` method:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: LangChain
      :tabid: langchain

      .. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/create-indexes-hybrid-search-langchain.rst

   .. tab:: PyMongo
      :tabid: pymongo
            
      .. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/create-indexes-hybrid-search-pymongo.rst
         
.. include:: /includes/search-shared/fact-indexes-build-initial-sync.rst

Run a Hybrid Search Query
--------------------------

Once MongoDB builds your indexes, you can run hybrid search queries on your data.
The following code uses the ``MongoDBAtlasHybridSearchRetriever`` `retriever 
<https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#retrievers>`__ to perform a hybrid search 
for the string ``"time travel"``. It also 
specifies the following parameters:

- ``vectorstore``: The name of the vector store instance.
- ``search_index_name``: The name of the {+fts+} index.
- ``top_k``: The number of documents to return.
- ``fulltext_penalty``: The penalty for full-text search. 

  The lower the penalty, the higher the full-text search score.
- ``vector_penalty``: The penalty for vector search. 
  
  The lower the penalty, the higher the vector search score.

The retriever returns a list of documents sorted by the sum of the 
full-text search score and the vector search score. The final output
of the code example includes the title, plot, and the 
different scores for each document.

Pass Results to a RAG Pipeline
------------------------------

You can pass your hybrid search results
into your |rag| pipeline to generate responses 
on the retrieved documents. The sample code 
does the following: 

- Defines a LangChain `prompt template 
  <https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#prompt-templates>`__
  to instruct the LLM to use 
  the retrieved documents as context for your query.
  LangChain passes these documents to the ``{context}`` input
  variable and your query to the ``{query}`` variable.

- Constructs a `chain 
  <https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language-lcel>`__
  that specifies the following:

  - The hybrid search retriever you defined to 
    retrieve relevant documents.
    
  - The prompt template that you defined.

  - An LLM from OpenAI to generate a 
    context-aware response. By default, this is the 
    ``gpt-3.5-turbo`` model.

- Prompts the chain with a sample query and returns the response.
  The generated response might vary.
