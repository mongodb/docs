Overview
--------

{+driver-short+} is a Python package that you can use to connect
to and communicate with MongoDB. This guide shows you how to create an
application that uses {+driver-short+} to connect to a MongoDB cluster hosted on
MongoDB Atlas.

.. tip:: 

   MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your MongoDB
   deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card required) MongoDB Atlas 
   deployment by following the steps in this guide.

Follow this guide to connect a sample Python application to a MongoDB Atlas
deployment. If you prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different driver or
programming language, see our :driver:`list of official drivers <>`.
