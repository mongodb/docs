Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB Ruby 
driver and the Mongoid Object Document Mapper (ODM).

Ruby Driver
-----------

You can add the driver to your application to work with MongoDB in
Ruby. See the :ruby:`official Ruby reference documentation <>` to
learn how to install and begin using the driver.

Object Document Mapper
----------------------

You can use Mongoid, the official MongoDB Ruby ODM, to streamline
validation, associations, and high-level data modeling functions in your
application. See the `Mongoid reference documentation
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongoid/current/>`__ to learn how to begin
using Mongoid.
