Deploy Three Config Servers for Production Deployments
======================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This procedure converts a test deployment with only one
:ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>` to a production deployment
with three config servers.

.. tip::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-use-cnames-for-config-servers.rst

For redundancy, all production :doc:`sharded clusters
</core/sharding-introduction>` should deploy three config servers on
three different machines. Use a single config server only for testing
deployments, never for production deployments. When you shift to
production, upgrade immediately to three config servers.

To convert a test deployment with one config server to a production
deployment with three config servers:

#. Shut down all existing MongoDB processes in the cluster. This
   includes:

   - all :program:`mongod` instances or :term:`replica sets <replica set>`
     that provide your shards.

   - all :program:`mongos` instances in your cluster.

#. Copy the entire :setting:`~storage.dbPath` file system tree from the
   existing config server to the two machines that will provide the
   additional config servers. These commands, issued on the system
   with the existing :ref:`config-database`, ``mongo-config0.example.net`` may
   resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      rsync -az /data/configdb mongo-config1.example.net:/data/configdb
      rsync -az /data/configdb mongo-config2.example.net:/data/configdb

#. Start all three config servers, using the same invocation that you
   used for the single config server.

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --configsvr

#. Restart all shard :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` processes.
