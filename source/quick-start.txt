Create a MongoDB Cluster
------------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Set Up a Free Tier Cluster in Atlas

      To set up your Atlas free cluster required for this Quick Start, complete the guide
      :guides:`MongoDB Atlas Setup </atlas/account>` guide.

      After completing the steps in the Atlas guide, you have a new MongoDB
      cluster deployed in Atlas, a new database user, and
      sample datasets loaded into your cluster. You also have
      a connection string similar to the following in your copy buffer:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: false

         "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.abc.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

   .. step:: Update the Placeholders

     Paste the connection string in your copy buffer into a file in your preferred text
     editor. Replace the ``<username>`` and ``<password>`` placeholders with
     your database user's username and password.

     Save this file to a safe location for use in the next step.

   .. step:: Add Your Connection String to an Environment Variable

      Run the following code in your shell to save the MongoDB connection string
      in your copy buffer from the previous step to an 
      environment variable. Storing your connection string in an
      environment variable keeps your credentials separate from your source code. This
      separation makes it less likely to expose your credentials when sharing your code.

      .. code-block:: bash

         export MONGODB_URI='<your connection string>'

      .. important::

         Make sure to replace the ``<username>`` and ``<password>`` sections of the connection 
         string with the username and password of your database user.

Set Up Your Project
-------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create the Project

      Create a new directory and use the ``dotnet new`` command to initialize your project
      as follows:

      .. code-block:: shell

         mkdir entity-quickstart
         cd entity-quickstart
         dotnet new console

   .. _entity-framework-add-mongodb-dependency:

   .. step:: Add the {+provider-long+} as a Dependency

      Use the ``dotnet add`` command to add the {+provider-short+} to your project as a
      dependency.

      .. code-block:: shell

         dotnet add package {+package+}

Query Your MongoDB Cluster from Your Application
------------------------------------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Add the Sample Code

      Open the file named ``Program.cs`` in the base directory of your project. Copy the
      following sample code into ``Program.cs``: 

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/Program.cs
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:

   .. step:: Query the Sample Data

      Run the following command in your shell. It should print the plot of the movie
      "Back to the Future" from the sample dataset:

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: none
            
            dotnet run entity-quickstart.csproj

         .. output::
            :language: none
            :visible: false

            A young man is accidentally sent 30 years into the past in a time-traveling
            DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, and must make sure his
            high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence.

      .. tip::

         If your output is empty, ensure you have loaded the
         :atlas:`sample datasets </sample-data/>` into your cluster.

After completing these steps, you should have a working {+framework+} application that
connects to your MongoDB cluster, runs a query on the
sample data, and prints out the result.
