Solution Overview
-----------------

Dynamic pricing, the art of adjusting prices in real time based on
market conditions, has become a crucial strategy for businesses aiming
to maximize revenue and gain a competitive edge. To effectively
implement dynamic pricing, a robust technological infrastructure is
essential. This solution integrates `MongoDB Atlas
<https://www.mongodb.com/atlas>`__ and Google Cloud Vertex AI to create
a real-time dynamic pricing microservice. By utilizing Google Cloud
Pub/Sub for rapid data ingestion, Vertex AI Notebooks and TensorFlow
models analyze customer behavior to optimize pricing strategies. MongoDB
Atlas serves as a flexible feature store for intricate pricing data,
while Google Cloud's robust computational resources power complex
calculations and hosting.

The outcome is a scalable and adaptable pricing system that delivers
instant price adjustments based on the latest market intelligence. This
integration enhances operational efficiency by effectively handling
large datasets and complex pricing scenarios. Continuous model
retraining guarantees ongoing accuracy and market competitiveness.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

The architecture for a dynamic pricing microservice integrates MongoDB
and Google Cloud Vertex AI to facilitate real-time data processing and
responsive pricing adjustments. At the core, Google Cloud Pub/Sub
handles the ingestion and distribution of customer behavior data,
allowing for scalable and efficient message processing. This data is
then cleaned and processed in Vertex AI Notebooks, where machine
learning models are developed using TensorFlow to predict optimal prices
based on patterns identified in historical data.

MongoDB Atlas serves as the central data repository and feature store,
storing complex pricing data and supporting the machine learning models.
The document model of MongoDB provides the flexibility needed to manage
and update pricing data dynamically. Google Cloud Functions orchestrate
the entire workflow, processing customer events, converting them into
tensors, and ensuring that the model predictions are updated in real
time in the MongoDB Atlas product catalog. In the architecture diagram,
the blue data flow illustrates how customer event data is ingested into
a Pub/Sub topic, leading to a push subscription that triggers the Cloud
Function. This function transforms raw events into tensors and updates
the predicted prices in the MongoDB product catalog.

This architectural approach allows for the isolation of raw event
threads, enabling the development of various services that can react in
real time for dynamic pricing or operate asynchronously for model
training. By maintaining loose coupling between components, the system
is resilient and avoids complete failures if one part experiences
issues. Publishers and subscribers can independently continue processing
their logic, ensuring a robust and flexible system that supports
continuous operation and seamless updates.

      - Clone the `repository <http://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/retail-store.git>`__ and navigate to the dynamicPricing microservice directory.
      - Install required Python packages using pip.
      - Set up environment variables for MongoDB Atlas, Google Cloud credentials, and Pub/Sub.
      - Configure a Pub/Sub topic in Google Cloud.
      - Develop the pricing logic for the dynamicPricing service.
      - Use `Vertex AI <https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai?hl=en>`__ to create a new notebook for connecting to MongoDB and training the model.
      - Train a `TensorFlow <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nykQEHp-fYg&t=7s>`__ model by cleaning data, building the model, and training it.
      - Save and upload the trained model to Google Cloud Storage.
      - Register the model in Vertex AI for management and deployment.

Advantage of MongoDB for Modeling Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding a tensor allows for an event-driven architecture with all
features in a single collection, which can streamline data retrieval and
processing but may lead to large, complex documents that require careful
management to maintain performance. This flexibility enables MongoDB to
house both operational data and a feature store within the same
collection, facilitating integrated data analytics and real-time
decision-making while potentially increasing storage costs and
complexity in data management.

Key Learnings
-------------

- **Centralized feature store:** MongoDB serves as a feature store, acting
  as a centralized repository specifically designed for storing, managing,
  and serving features for `machine learning
  <https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/machine-learning>`__ (ML)
  models. Its `polymorphic
  <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/polymorphic-pattern/>`__
  capabilities enable the utilization of a single interface to represent
  various types of data. This implies that as new features are introduced
  or pricing models evolve, MongoDB can adeptly manage diverse data types
  within the same system. In the context of dynamic pricing, this
  capability facilitates the seamless incorporation of new pricing factors
  or variables without causing disruptions to existing data structures or
  operations.
- **Scalability and efficiency:** `Google Cloud Pub/Sub
  <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub?hl=en>`__ can handle massive
  volumes of customer data efficiently, ensuring scalability for
  real-world applications. While this microservice simulates only 25
  customer events every three seconds, Pub/Sub is capable of processing
  much larger data streams.
- **Real-time price updates:** `Cloud functions
  <https://cloud.google.com/functions?hl=en>`__ trigger `TensorFlow
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nykQEHp-fYg&t=7s>`__ models to
  generate dynamic prices based on customer behavior. These generated
  prices are then inserted or updated (upserted) back into the product
  catalog collection in MongoDB. This enables real-time adjustments in
  the e-commerce application because the application's front end
  retrieves data directly from the same collection.
