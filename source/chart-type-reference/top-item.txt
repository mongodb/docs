Top Item charts show information from the document with the
greatest or smallest value for a specified field.

When you create a Top Item chart, you specify:

- The field by which to sort your collection.

- Whether you want to sort in ascending or descending order.

- The fields you want to display from the first document returned by
  your specified sort.

Encoding Channels
-----------------

Top Item charts utilize the following :ref:`encoding channels
<encoding-channels>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Encoding Channel
     - Description

   * - Sort
     - The field by which to sort the collection. You can specify an
       ascending or descending sort.

   * - Display
     - The fields to display from the top item in the collection after
       sorting.
       
.. note::

   You cannot perform aggregations on :guilabel:`Display`
   fields. 

Use Cases
---------

Use Top Item charts to show information about the most extreme or most
recent instance of a particular field value. For example, you can use
Top Item charts to show information on:

- The most recent reading from a collection of sensor data, such as
  temperature readings.

- The highest rated movie in a collection.

- The cheapest available room in a collection of available hotel
  listings.

- The largest sale recorded in the past month (when combining a Top
  Item chart with :ref:`date filters <charts-filter-documents>`).

Example
-------

The following chart uses a data source containing :atlas:`Sample AirBnB
Listing </sample-data/sample-airbnb/>` data and shows information on the
document with the highest ``monthly_price`` in the collection:

.. figure:: /images/charts/top-item-example.png
   :figwidth: 700px
   :alt: Top Item Chart with AirBnB Data

The chart sorts the documents based on ``monthly_price`` in
descending order, and returns the first document appearing in the sort.

The chart displays the following fields:

- ``monthly_price``

- ``property_type``

- ``country``

- ``suburb``
