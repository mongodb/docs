.. _faq-dev-namespace:

What is a namespace in MongoDB?
-------------------------------

A "namespace" is the concatenation of the :term:`database`
name and the :term:`collection` names with a period character in
between.

Collections are containers for documents that share one or more
indexes. Databases are groups of collections stored on disk using a
single set of data files.

For an example ``acme.users`` namespace, ``acme`` is the database
name and ``users`` is the collection name. Period characters **can**
occur in collection names, so that the ``acme.user.history`` is a
valid namespace, with the ``acme`` database name, and the
``user.history`` collection name. 

While data models like this appear to support nested collections, the
collection namespace is flat, and there is no difference from the
perspective of MongoDB between ``acme``, ``acme.users``, and
``acme.records``.

How do you copy all objects from one collection to another?
-----------------------------------------------------------

In the :program:`mongo` shell, you can use the following operation to
duplicate the entire collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.find().forEach( function(x){db.user.insert(x)} );

.. note::

   Because this process decodes :term:`BSON` documents to :term:`JSON`
   during the copy procedure, documents you may incur a loss of
   type-fidelity.

   Consider using :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore` to
   maintain type fidelity.

Also consider the :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` :term:`command
<database command>` that may provide some of this functionality.

If you remove a document, does MongoDB remove it from disk?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Yes.

When you use :method:`db.collection.remove()`, the object will no longer exist in
MongoDB's on-disk data storage.

When does MongoDB write updates to disk?
----------------------------------------

MongoDB flushes writes to disk on a regular interval. In the default
configuration, MongoDB writes data to the main data files on disk
every 60 seconds and commits the :term:`journal` every 100
milliseconds. These values are configurable with the
:setting:`journalCommitInterval` and :setting:`syncdelay`.

These values represent the *maximum* amount of time between the
completion of a write operation and the point when the write is
durable in the journal, if enabled, and when MongoDB flushes data to
the disk. In many cases MongoDB and the operating system flush data to
disk more frequently, so that the above values resents a theoretical
maximum.

However, by default, MongoDB uses a "lazy" strategy to write to
disk. This is advantageous in situations where the database receives a
thousand increments to an object within one second, MongoDB only needs
to flush this data to disk once. In addition to the aforementioned
configuration options, you can also use :dbcommand:`fsync` and
:dbcommand:`getLastError` to modify this strategy.

How do I do transactions and locking in MongoDB?
------------------------------------------------

MongoDB does not have support for traditional locking or complex
transactions with rollback. MongoDB aims to be lightweight, fast, and
predictable in its performance. This is similar to the MySQL MyISAM
autocommit model. By keeping transaction support extremely simple,
MongoDB can provide greater performance especially for
:term:`partitioned <partition>` or :term:`replicated <replication>`
systems with a number of database server processes.

MongoDB *does* have support for atomic operations *within* a single
document. Given the possibilities provided by nested documents, this
feature provides support for a large number of use-cases.

.. seealso:: The :wiki:`Atomic Operations <Atomic+Operations>` wiki page.

How do you aggregate data with MongoDB?
---------------------------------------

In version 2.1 and later, you can use the new ":doc:`aggregation
framework </applications/aggregation>`," with the
:dbcommand:`aggregate` command.

MongoDB also supports :term:`map-reduce` with the
:dbcommand:`mapReduce`, as well as basic aggregation with the
:dbcommand:`group`, :dbcommand:`count`, and
:dbcommand:`distinct`. commands.

.. seealso:: The :wiki:`Aggregation <Aggregation>` wiki page.

Why does MongoDB log so many "Connection Accepted" events?
----------------------------------------------------------

If you see a very large number connection and re-connection messages
in your MongoDB log, then clients are frequently connecting and
disconnecting to the MongoDB server. This is normal behavior for
applications that do not use request pooling, such as CGI. Consider
using FastCGI, an Apache Module, or some other kind of persistent
application server to decrease the connection overhead.

If these connections do not impact your performance you can use the
run-time :setting:`quiet` option or the command-line option
:option:`--quiet <mongod --quiet>` to suppress these messages from the
log.

Does MongoDB run on Amazon EBS?
-------------------------------

Yes.

MongoDB users of all sizes have had a great deal of success using
MongoDB on the EC2 platform using EBS disks.

.. seealso:: The ":wiki:`MongoDB on the Amazon Platform <Amazon+EC2>`"
   wiki page.

Why are MongoDB's data files so large?
--------------------------------------

MongoDB aggressively preallocates data files to reserve space and
avoid file system fragmentation. You can use the :setting:`smallfiles`
flag to modify the file preallocation strategy.

.. seealso:: This wiki page that address :wiki:`MongoDB disk use <Excessive+Disk+Space>`.

.. _faq-small-documents:

How do I optimize storage use for small documents?
--------------------------------------------------

Each MongoDB document contains a certain amount of overhead. This
overhead is normally insignificant but becomes significant if all
documents are just a few bytes, as might be the case if the documents
in your collection only have one or two fields. 

Consider the following suggestions and strategies for optimizing
storage utilization for these collections:

- Use the ``_id`` field explicitly.

  MongoDB clients automatically add an ``_id`` field to each document
  and generate a unique 12-byte :term:`ObjectId` for the ``_id``
  field. Furthermore, MongoDB always indexes the ``_id`` field. For
  smaller documents this may account for a significant amount of
  space.

  To optimize storage use, users can specify a value for the ``_id`` field
  explicitly when inserting documents into the collection. This
  strategy allows applications to store a value in the ``_id`` field
  that would have occupied space in another portion of the document. 
  
  You can store any value in the ``_id`` field, but because this value
  serves as a primary key for documents in the collection, it must
  uniquely identify them. If the field's value is not unique, then it
  cannot serve as a primary key as there would be collisions in
  collection.

- Use shorter field names.

  MongoDB stores all field names in every document. For most
  documents, this represents a small fraction of the space used by a
  document; however, for small documents the field names may represent
  a proportionally large amount of space. Consider a collection of
  documents that resemble the following: 

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { last_name : "Smith", best_score: 3.9 }

  If you shorten the filed named ``last_name`` to ``lname`` and the
  field name ``best_score`` to ``score``, as follows, you could save 9
  bytes per document.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { lname : "Smith", score : 3.9 }

  Shortening field names reduces expressiveness and does not provide
  considerable benefit on for larger documents and where document
  overhead is not significant concern. Shorter field names do not
  reduce the size of indexes, because indexes have a predefined
  structure. 

  In general it is not necessary to use short field names.

- Embed documents.

  In some cases you may want to embed documents in other documents
  and save on the per-document overhead.

How does MongoDB address SQL or Query injection?
------------------------------------------------

BSON
~~~~

As a client program assembles a query in MongoDB, it builds a BSON object, not a string. Thus
traditional SQL injection attacks are not a problem. More details and some nuances are covered below.

MongoDB represents queries as :term:`BSON` objects. Typically
:doc:`client libraries </applications/drivers>` provide a convenient,
injection free, process to build these objects. Consider the following
C++ example:

.. code-block:: cpp

   BSONObj my_query = BSON( "name" << a_name );
   auto_ptr<DBClientCursor> cursor = c.query("tutorial.persons", my_query);

Here, ``my_query`` then will have a value such as ``{ name : "Joe"
}``. If ``my_query`` contained special characters, for example
``,``, ``:``, and ``{``, the query simply wouldn't match any
documents. For example, users cannot hijack a query and convert it to
a delete.

JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~

All of the following MongoDB operations permit you to run arbitrary JavaScript
expressions directly on the server:- :operator:`$where`:

- :operator:`$where`
- :method:`db.eval()`
- :dbcommand:`mapReduce`
- :dbcommand:`group`

You must exercise care in these cases to prevent users from
submitting malicious JavaScript.

Fortunately, you can express most queries in MongoDB without
JavaScript and for queries that require JavaScript, you can mix
JavaScript and non-JavaScript in a single query. Place all the
user-supplied fields directly in a :term:`BSON` field and pass
JavaScript code to the :operator:`$where` field.

- If you need to pass user-supplied values in a :operator:`$where`
  clause, you may escape these values with the ``CodeWScope``
  mechanism. When you set user-submitted values as variables in the
  scope document,  you can avoid evaluating them on the database
  server.

- If you need to use :method:`db.eval()` with user supplied values, you can
  either use a ``CodeWScope`` or you can supply extra arguments to your
  function. For instance:

  .. code-block:: sh

     db.eval(function(userVal){...},
             user_value);

  This will ensure that your application sends ``user_value`` to the
  database server as data rather than code.

.. _faq-dollar-sign-escaping:

Dollar Sign Operator Escaping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Field names in MongoDB's query language have a semantic. The
dollar sign (i.e ``$``) is a reserved character used to represent
:doc:`operators </reference/operators>` (i.e. :operator:`$inc`.) Thus,
you should ensure that your application's users cannot inject operators
into their inputs.

In some cases, you may wish to build a BSON object with a
user-provided key.  In these situations, keys will need to substitute
the reserved ``$`` and ``.`` characters. Any character is sufficient,
but consider using the Unicode full width equivalents: ``U+FF04``
(i.e. "＄") and ``U+FFOE`` (i.e. "．").

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: cpp

   BSONObj my_object = BSON( a_key << a_name );

The user may have supplied a ``$`` value in the ``a_key`` value. At
the same time, ``my_object`` might be ``{ $where : "things"
}``. Consider the following cases:

- **Insert**. Inserting this into the database does no harm. The
  insert process does not evaluate the object as a query.

  .. note::

     MongoDB client drivers, if properly implemented, check for
     reserved characters in keys on inserts.

- **Update**.  The :method:`db.collection.update()` operation permits ``$`` operators
  in the update argument but does not support the
  :operator:`$where` operator. Still, some users
  may be able to inject operators that can manipulate a single
  document only. Therefore your application should escape keys, as
  mentioned above, if reserved characters are possible.

- **Query** Generally this is not a problem for queries that
  resemble ``{ x : user_obj }``: dollar signs are not top level and
  have no effect. Theoretically it may be possible for the user to
  build a query themselves. But checking the user-submitted content for
  ``$`` characters in key names may help protect against this kind
  of injection.

Driver-Specific Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the "`PHP MongoDB Driver Security Notes
<http://us.php.net/manual/en/mongo.security.php>`_" page in the PHP
driver documentation for more information

.. _faq-dev-concurrency:

How does MongoDB provide concurrency?
-------------------------------------

MongoDB implements a readers-writer lock. This means that
at any one time, only one client may be writing or any number
of clients may be reading, but that reading and writing cannot
occur simultaneously.

In standalone and :term:`replica sets <replica set>` the lock's scope
applies to a single :program:`mongod` instance or :term:`primary`
instance. In a sharded cluster, locks apply to each individual shard,
not to the whole cluster.

For more information, see :doc:`/faq/concurrency`.

What is the compare order for BSON types?
-----------------------------------------

MongoDB permits documents within a single collection to
have fields with different :term:`BSON` types. For instance,
the following documents may exist within a single collection.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { x: "string" }
   { x: 42 }

When comparing values of different :term:`BSON` types, MongoDB uses the following
compare order:

- Null
- Numbers (ints, longs, doubles)
- Symbol, String
- Object
- Array
- BinData
- ObjectID
- Boolean
- Date, Timestamp
- Regular Expression

.. note::

   MongoDB treats some types as equivalent for comparison purposes.
   For instance, numeric types undergo conversion before comparison.

Consider the following :program:`mongo` example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.test.insert({x:3});
   db.test.insert( {x : 2.9} );
   db.test.insert( {x : new Date()} );
   db.test.insert( {x : true } );

   db.test.find().sort({x:1});
   { "_id" : ObjectId("4b03155dce8de6586fb002c7"), "x" : 2.9 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("4b03154cce8de6586fb002c6"), "x" : 3 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("4b031566ce8de6586fb002c9"), "x" : true }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("4b031563ce8de6586fb002c8"), "x" : "Tue Nov 17 2009 16:28:03 GMT-0500 (EST)" }

The :operator:`$type` operator provides access to :term:`BSON type
<BSON types>` comparison in the MongoDB query syntax. See the
documentation on :term:`BSON types` and the :operator:`$type` operator
for additional information.

.. include:: /includes/warning-mixing-types.rst

.. seealso::

   - The :wiki:`Tailable Cursors <Tailable+Cursors>` wiki page for an
     example of a C++ use of ``MinKey``.

   - The :source:`jsobj.h <src/mongo/db/jsobj.h>` source file for the
     definition of ``MinKey`` and ``MaxKey``.

.. _faq-restrictions-on-collection-names:

Are there any restrictions on the names of Collections?
-------------------------------------------------------

Collection names can be any UTF-8 string with the following
exceptions:

- A collection name should begin with a letter or an underscore.

- The empty string (``""``) is not a valid collection name.

- Collection names cannot contain the ``$`` character. (version 2.2 only)

- Collection names cannot contain the null character: ``\0``

- Do not name a collection using the ``system.`` prefix. MongoDB
  reserves ``system.``
  for system collections, such as the
  ``system.indexes`` collection.

- The maximum size of a collection name is 128 characters, including
  the name of the database. However, for maximum flexibility,
  collections should have names less than 80 characters.

If your collection name includes special characters, such as the
underscore character, then to access the collection use the
:method:`db.getCollection()` method or a :api:`similar method for your
driver <>`.

.. example:: To create a collection ``_foo`` and insert the
   ``{ a : 1 }`` document, use the following operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getCollection("_foo").insert( { a : 1 } )

   To perform a query, use the :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>`
   find method, in as the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getCollection("_foo").find()
