Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the different settings to control
the behavior of your ``MongoClient``.

The following sections describe commonly used settings:

- :ref:`MongoClient Settings <mcs-settings>`
- :ref:`Cluster Settings <mcs-cluster-settings>`
- :ref:`Socket Settings <mcs-socket-settings>`
- :ref:`Connection Pool Settings <mcs-connectionpool-settings>`
- :ref:`Server Settings <mcs-server-settings>`
- :ref:`TLS/SSL Settings <mcs-ssl-settings>`

.. _mcs-settings:

MongoClient Settings
--------------------

You can control the behavior of your ``MongoClient`` by creating and passing
in a `MongoClientSettings <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.html>`__
object to the `MongoClients.create() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/MongoClients.html#create(com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings)>`__
method.

To create a ``MongoClientSettings`` object, use the
``MongoClientSettings.builder()`` method and chain methods to specify your
settings. After chaining them, use the ``build()`` method to create the
``MongoClientSettings`` object.

The following table describes all the methods you can chain to modify your
connection behavior:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``addCommandListener()``
     - Adds a listener for :ref:`command events <command-events-java>`.

   * - ``applicationName()``
     - Sets the logical name of the application using the ``MongoClient``.

   * - ``applyConnectionString()``
     - Applies the settings from the given ``ConnectionString`` to the
       builder. If you omit this method, the driver attempts to connect to
       ``localhost``.

   * - ``applyToClusterSettings()``
     - Applies the ``ClusterSettings.Builder`` block and then sets the
       :ref:`cluster settings <mcs-cluster-settings>`.

   * - ``applyToConnectionPoolSettings()``
     - Applies the ``ConnectionPoolSettings.Builder`` block and then sets the
       :ref:`connection pool settings <mcs-connectionpool-settings>`.

   * - ``applyToServerSettings()``
     - Applies the ``ServerSettings.Builder`` block and then sets the
       :ref:`server settings <mcs-server-settings>`.

   * - ``applyToSocketSettings()``
     - Applies the ``SocketSettings.Builder`` block and then sets the
       :ref:`socket settings <mcs-socket-settings>`.

   * - ``applyToSslSettings()``
     - Applies the ``SslSettings.Builder`` block and then sets the
       :ref:`TLS/SSL settings <mcs-ssl-settings>`.

   * - ``autoEncryptionSettings()``
     - | Sets the :ref:`auto-encryption settings <auto-encryption-decryption-java>`.
       |
       | If you omit ``keyVaultClient`` or set
       | ``bypassAutomaticEncryption`` to false in your
       | ``AutoEncryptionSettings``, the driver creates a separate,
       | internal ``MongoClient``.
       |
       | The internal ``MongoClient`` configuration differs from the
       | parent ``MongoClient`` by setting the ``minPoolSize`` to  0 and
       | omitting the ``AutoEncryptionSettings``.

   * - ``codecRegistry()``
     - Sets the :ref:`codec registry <codecs-codecregistry>`.

   * - ``commandListenerList()``
     - Sets the :ref:`command listeners <command-events-java>`.

   * - ``compressorList()``
     - Sets the :ref:`compressors <compression>` to use for compressing
       messages to the server.

   * - ``credential()``
     - Sets the :ref:`credential <authentication-mechanisms-java>`.

   * - ``readConcern()``
     - Sets the :manual:`read concern </reference/read-concern/>`.

   * - ``readPreference()``
     - Sets the :manual:`read preference </core/read-preference/>`.

   * - ``retryReads()``
     - Whether the driver should :manual:`retry reads </core/retryable-reads/>`
       if a network error occurs.

   * - ``retryWrites()``
     - Whether the driver should :manual:`retry writes </core/retryable-writes/>`
       if a network error occurs.

   * - ``serverApi()``
     - Sets the :ref:`server API <stable-api-java>` to use when sending
       commands to the server.

   * - ``streamFactoryFactory()``
     - Sets the factory to use to create a ``StreamFactory``.

   * - ``uuidRepresentation()``
     - Sets the UUID representation to use when encoding instances of UUID
       and decoding BSON binary values with subtype of 3.

   * - ``writeConcern()``
     - Sets the :manual:`write concern </reference/write-concern/>`.

.. _connection-string-example:

Example
~~~~~~~

This example demonstrates specifying a ``ConnectionString``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin ConnectionString
   :end-before: end ConnectionString
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3
   :dedent:

.. tip::

   Each setting has an ``applyConnectionString()`` method. They are
   rarely needed within the settings, so you should use this method as shown
   in :ref:`the preceding example <connection-string-example>`.

.. note:: Chain Order

   Some options in the settings map to a connection string option.
   If you specify the same options in your settings and connection
   string, the order you chain them determines which option the driver
   uses. The driver uses the **last** setting it reads.

   For example, this snippet contains settings with the following times
   for the driver to connect to an available socket:

   - The connection string specifies within ``2 SECONDS``
   - The :ref:`socket settings <mcs-socket-settings>` specifies within
     ``5 SECONDS``

   .. code-block:: java
      :emphasize-lines: 2,4

      MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(
         MongoClientSettings.builder().applyConnectionString(new ConnectionString("mongodb+srv:/<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>?connectTimeoutMS(2000)"))
            .applyToSocketSettings(builder ->
            builder.connectTimeout(5, SECONDS))
            .build());

   Since the driver reads the socket settings options last, the driver
   expects to connect to an available socket within ``5 SECONDS`` before
   timing out.

.. _mcs-cluster-settings:

Cluster Settings
----------------

Chain the `applyToClusterSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToClusterSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
method to modify the driver's behavior when interacting with your
MongoDB cluster.

The following table describes all the methods you can chain to your
settings to modify the driver's behavior:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``addClusterListener()``
     - Adds a listener for cluster-related events.

   * - ``applyConnectionString()``
     - Uses the settings from a ``ConnectionString`` object.

   * - ``applySettings()``
     - Uses the cluster settings specified in a ``ClusterSettings`` object.

   * - ``hosts()``
     - Sets all the specified locations of a Mongo server.

   * - ``localThreshold()``
     - Sets the amount of time that a server’s round trip can take and still
       be eligible for server selection.

   * - ``mode()``
     - Sets how to connect to a MongoDB server.

   * - ``requiredClusterType()``
     - Sets the type of cluster required for the cluster.

   * - ``requiredReplicaSetName()``
     - Sets the replica set name required for the cluster.

   * - ``serverSelectionTimeout()``
     - Sets the maximum time to select a primary node before throwing a
       timeout exception.

   * - ``serverSelector()``
     - Adds a server selector to apply before server selection.

   * - ``srvHost()``
     - Sets the host name to use to look up an SRV DNS record to find the
       MongoDB hosts.

       .. note::

          When setting ``srvHost``, the driver does not process any
          associated TXT records associated with the host.

          If you want to enable the processing of TXT records, you must
          specify the SRV host in the connection string using the
          ``applyConnectionString()`` method.

          .. code-block:: java
             :emphasize-lines: 3

             MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(
                MongoClientSettings.builder()
                   .applyConnectionString(new ConnectionString("mongodb+srv://host1.acme.com")))

   * - ``srvMaxHosts()``
     - | Sets the maximum number of hosts the driver can connect to when using
         the DNS seedlist (SRV) connection protocol, identified by the
         ``mongodb+srv`` connection string prefix.
       |
       | Throws an exception if you are not using the SRV connection protocol.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example specifies for the driver to connect directly to a server,
regardless of the type of MongoDB cluster its' a part of:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin ClusterSettings
   :end-before: end ClusterSettings
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3-4
   :dedent:

.. tip::

   This is analogous to the ``directConnection`` parameter you can specify
   in your connection URI. See :ref:`<connection-options>` for more
   information.

.. _mcs-socket-settings:

Chain the `applyToSocketSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToSocketSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
method to modify the driver's behavior when connecting and communicating
with your MongoDB server.

The following table describes all the methods you can chain to your settings
to modify the driver's behavior:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``applyConnectionString()``
     - Uses the settings from a ``ConnectionString`` object.

   * - ``applySettings()``
     - Uses the socket settings specified in a ``SocketSettings`` object.

   * - ``receiveBufferSize()``
     - Sets the socket's buffer size when receiving.

   * - ``sendBufferSize()``
     - Sets the socket's buffer size when sending.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example specifies the following driver behavior in a MongoDB socket:

- To connect to an available socket within ``10 SECONDS``
- To read from an available socket within ``15 SECONDS``

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin SocketSettings
   :end-before: end SocketSettings
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3-5
   :dedent:

.. _mcs-connectionpool-settings:

Connection Pool Settings
------------------------

Chain the `applyToConnectionPoolSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToConnectionPoolSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
method to modify the way the driver manages its connection pool.

The following table describes all the methods you can chain to your
settings to modify the driver's behavior:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``addConnectionPoolListener()``
     - Adds a listener for connection pool-related events.

   * - ``applyConnectionString()``
     - Uses the settings from a ``ConnectionString`` object.

   * - ``applySettings()``
     - Uses the connection pool settings specified in a
       ``ConnectionPoolSettings`` object.

   * - ``maintenanceFrequency()``

   * - ``maintenanceInitialDelay()``
     - Sets the time to wait before running the first maintenance job.

   * - ``maxConnectionIdleTime()``
     - Sets the maximum time a connection can be idle before it's closed.

   * - ``maxConnectionLifeTime()``
     - Sets the maximum time a pooled connection can be alive before it's
       closed.

   * - ``maxWaitTime()``
     - Sets the maximum time to wait for an available connection.

   * - ``maxSize()``
     - Sets the maximum amount of connections associated with a connection
       pool.

   * - ``minSize()``
     - Sets the minimum amount of connections associated with a connection
       pool.


.. note::

   This ``maxSize`` and ``minSize`` settings apply to each server
   in the cluster you connect the driver to.

   For example, assume you connect the driver to a cluster with three
   ``mongos`` servers. This means that there can be at most ``maxSize``
   connections and at least ``minSize`` connections to each ``mongos`` server.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example specifies the following driver behavior in a pool of
``Connection`` types:

- The thread to wait at most ``10 SECONDS`` for an available connection
- To have at most ``200`` connections associated with the pool

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/mcs.java
   :start-after: begin ConnectionPoolSettings
   :end-before: end ConnectionPoolSettings
