"Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections <collection>`"

"The *Materialized Paths* pattern stores each tree node in a document; in "
"addition to the tree node, document stores as a string the id(s) of the "
"node's ancestors or path. Although the *Materialized Paths* pattern "
"requires additional steps of working with strings and regular "
"expressions, the pattern also provides more flexibility in working with "
"the path, such as finding nodes by partial paths."
