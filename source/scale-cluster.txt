Scale a Cluster
===============

.. TODO: Use different title?
         Reconfigure a Cluster
         Modify a Cluster Configuration

.. default-domain:: mongodb

For an existing |service| cluster in your group, you can modify:

- the instance size.

- the replication factor.

- the cluster topology from a replica set to a :manual:`sharded cluster
  </core/sharding>`.

- the number of shards for a sharded cluster.

- the enabling or disabling of backup.

Some configuration changes require migration to new servers; e.g.
changing the instance size. To provide continuous availability, scaling
migrations are performed in a rolling fashion. However, depending on
the amount of data to migrate, migrations can take a significant amount
of time.
