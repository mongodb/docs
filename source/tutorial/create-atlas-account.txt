===========================
Create an |service| Account
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

*Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*

Register for |a-service| account using your GitHub account, your Google
account or your email address.

Considerations
--------------

To register with and log in to |service|, you can use one -- and only
one -- of the following options:

- Your email account
- Your GitHub account
- Your Google account

.. note:: 
   If your company uses :doc:`/security/federated-authentication`,
   you must use your company email address.

.. _github-accounts:

GitHub Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you register with your GitHub Account, the following differences
apply when using your GitHub account with |service|:

- .. include:: /includes/facts/github-auth/account-details.rst

- .. include:: /includes/facts/github-auth/2fa.rst

- .. include:: /includes/facts/github-auth/unlink-account.rst

.. _google-accounts:

Google Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you register with your Google Account, the following differences
apply when using your Google account with |service|:

- .. include:: /includes/facts/google-auth/account-details.rst

- .. include:: /includes/facts/google-auth/2fa.rst

- .. include:: /includes/facts/google-auth/unlink-account.rst

|mms-full| Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use |mms-full|, use your |mms| credentials to
:ref:`log in <atlas-account-login>` to |service|. You can then
create a new |service| project from |mms|.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DOCSP-22813
            
GitHub Accounts Require a Public Email Address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you try to register with Github, you must have an public email
address associated with your GitHub account. |service| returns an error
if you attempt to register without a public email address.

To set a public GitHub email address:

1. After you log into GitHub, click :guilabel:`Settings` on your
   profile menu. Your :guilabel:`Public Profile` page should display.

2. Select one email address from the :guilabel:`Public email` dropdown
   in your :guilabel:`Public Profile`.

   If GitHub greys out this dropdown menu:

   a. Click :guilabel:`Emails` from the left-side menu.

   b. Clear the :guilabel:`Keep my email addresses private` box.

   c. Return to the :guilabel:`Public Profile` page and select an email
      address from the :guilabel:`Public email` dropdown.

3. Click :guilabel:`Update profile` to save the changes.
