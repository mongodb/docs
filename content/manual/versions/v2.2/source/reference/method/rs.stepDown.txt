.. method:: rs.stepDown(seconds)

   :param init seconds: Specify the duration of this operation. If not
                        specified the command uses the default value
                        of 60 seconds.

   :returns: disconnects shell.

   Forces the current replica set member to step down as
   :term:`primary` and then attempt to avoid election as primary for
   the designated number of seconds. Produces an error if the current
   node is not primary.

   This function will disconnect the shell briefly and forces a
   reconnection as the :term:`replica set` renegotiates which node
   will be :term:`primary`. As a result, the shell will display an
   error even if this command succeeds.

   :method:`rs.stepDown()` provides a wrapper around the
   :term:`database command` :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown`.
