MongoDB supports x.509 certificate authentication for client authentication and
internal authentication of the members of replica sets and sharded clusters.

x.509 certificate authentication requires a secure :doc:`TLS/SSL connection
</tutorial/configure-ssl>`.

Client x.509 Certificates
-------------------------

To authenticate to servers, clients can use x.509 certificates instead
of usernames and passwords. 

Client Certificate Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/x509-certificate-client.rst

.. _client-x509-mongodb-user:

MongoDB User and ``$external`` Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To authenticate with a client certificate, you must first add the value
of the ``subject`` from the client certificate as a MongoDB user. Each
unique x.509 client certificate corresponds to a single MongoDB user;
i.e. you cannot use a single client certificate to authenticate more
than one MongoDB user.

Add the user in the ``$external`` database; i.e. the
:ref:`authentication-database` is the ``$external`` database

Authenticate
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To authenticate using x.509 client certificate, connect to MongoDB over
TLS/SSL connection; i.e. include the ``--ssl`` and ``--sslPEMKeyFile``
command line options.

Then in the ``$external`` database, use :method:`db.auth()` to
authenticate the :ref:`user corresponding to the client certificate
<client-x509-mongodb-user>`.

For an example, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication`

Member x.509 Certificates
--------------------------

For internal authentication, members of sharded clusters and replica sets
can use x.509 certificates instead of keyfiles, which use
:doc:`/core/security-mongodb-cr` authentication mechanism.
