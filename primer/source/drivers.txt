Background
----------

Drivers for MongoDB are the client libraries that handle the interface
between the application and the MongoDB servers and
deployments. Drivers are responsible for managing connections to
MongoDB standalone instances, :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, or
:term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`. Drivers also handle the
translation of documents between :term:`BSON` objects and native
mapping structures, as well as providing the methods and interfaces
that applications use to interact with MongoDB.

The drivers attempt to make using MongoDB idiomatic and consistent
with the paradigms of the host language, to minimize the overhead and
complexity of using MongoDB. Additionally, MongoDB drivers are
generally consistent with each other, so that you can easily integrate
MongoDB into projects that use more than one language without
sacrificing idiomatic conformity. Therefore, drivers balance two
design goals: consistency with host language paradigms and idioms, and
consistency with other MongoDB drivers and standards.

As you continue to use MongoDB, select the driver or drivers for
language that your application use. If you are developing a new
application, you can use any driver you like.
