description: |
  :program:`mongoperf` accepts configuration options in the form of a
  file that holds a :term:`JSON` document. You must stream the
  content of this file into :program:`mongoperf`, as in the following
  operation:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongoperf < config

  In this example ``config`` is the name of a file that holds a JSON
  document that resembles the following example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

    {
      nThreads:<n>,
      fileSizeMB:<n>,
      sleepMicros:<n>,
      mmf:<bool>,
      r:<bool>,
      w:<bool>,
      recSizeKB:<n>,
      syncDelay:<n>
    }

  See the :ref:`mongoperf-fields` section for documentation of each
  of these fields.
