         The ``mongo`` shell is packaged with the MongoDB Server
         Community and Enterprise distributions, and is also available
         for users of Atlas as a client-only download.
         
         For standalone (non-cloud) distributions, check in the bin
         directory of your MongoDB install directory (MongoDB installs
         usually live in a directory that starts with "mongodb-"). You
         should see a file called ``mongo``, which is the shell
         executable.
         
         If you are unable to find an install of ``mongo`` in your bin
         directory, or if you don't have a local copy of mongo and need
         to install the client separately, select the appropriate
         environment below and follow the install directions.
