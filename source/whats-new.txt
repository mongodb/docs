    instead, see the Legacy SSL options deprecated section in the
    v5.7.0 Release Highlights linked at the end of this section.

- A new option for ``findOneAnd...`` compound methods. The ``includeResultMetaData``
  option allows you to specify whether to include information about the
  operation result. See the
  :ref:`Compound Operations Built-in Methods <node-compound-operations-builtin>`
  section for more information.

- Support for change stream split events which enables processing change
  stream documents that exceed the 16MB maximum BSON size limit.

- An API to manage Search indexes from within your application. To
  learn more, see :ref:`Search Indexes <node-indexes-search>`.

To learn more about this release, see the

-----------------

New features of the 5.5 {+driver-short+} release include:

- The driver now accurately detects Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)
  environments in AWS by considering AWS environment variables only if
  they begin with ``AWS_Lambda_``.
- You must upgrade ``mongodb-client-encryption`` to version 2.8.0 or
  later if you want to create an encrypted collection by using the
  Queryable Encryption feature.

.. _version-5.4:

What's New in 5.4
-----------------

New features of the 5.4 {+driver-short+} release include:

.. important:: Deprecation Notice

  - The ``collStats`` operation is deprecated. Use the :manual:`$collStats
    </reference/operator/aggregation/collStats>` aggregation operator instead.
  - The TypeScript interface passed to the ``db.command()`` method incorrectly
    includes certain options. These options have been deprecated.

- The ``ChangeStream.tryNext`` method now uses the schema-specific
  ``TChange`` generic type instead of the ``Document`` interface.

To learn more, see the `v5.4.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v5.4.0>`__.

New features of the 5.3 {+driver-short+} release include:

.. important:: Deprecation Notice

    - The ``forEach()`` cursor method, which allows you to iteratively access
      results from queries and aggregations, is deprecated. Use the
      ``for await...of`` syntax instead, as shown
      :ref:`here. <node-fundamentals-async-iteration>`
    - The ``addUser()`` method is deprecated. Use ``createUser()`` instead.
    - The ``keepAlive`` and ``keepAliveInitialDelay`` connection options are

- Client metadata now includes function as a service (FaaS) environment information
  and alternative runtime detection.
- The driver now allows SRV record addresses that contain a trailing dot.
- ``UpdateResult.upsertedId`` now returns null when no documents are updated.

To learn more, see the `v5.3.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v5.3.0>`__.

.. _version-5.2:

What's New in 5.2
-----------------

New features of the 5.2 {+driver-short+} release include:

- The driver now supports automatically obtaining Azure credentials when using
  automatic Queryable Encryption.

To learn more, see the `v5.2.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v5.2.0>`__.

.. _version-5.1:

What's New in 5.1
-----------------

New features of the 5.1 {+driver-short+} release include:

- The driver now supports automatic serialization of JavaScript ``bigint`` to
  ``BSON.Long``. It also supports the deserialization of ``BSON.Long`` values returned
  from the server to ``bigint`` values when the ``useBigInt64`` flag is passed
  as true.

To learn more, see the `v5.1.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v5.1.0>`__.

.. _version-5.0:

What's New in 5.0
-----------------

.. important:: Breaking Changes in v5.0

   - Version 5.0 of the {+driver-short+} is not compatible with Node.js
     v12 or earlier. If you want to use this version of the driver, You must
     use Node.js v14.20.1 or greater.

   - This release removes support for callbacks in favor of a promise-based API.
     The following list provides some strategies for callback users to adopt this
     version:

     - Migrate to the promise-based API (recommended)
     - Use the promise-based API and ``util.callbackify``
     - Add ``mongodb-legacy`` to continue using callbacks

     For more information about these strategies, see
     `Changes in the MongoDB Node.js Driver v5 <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/main/etc/notes/CHANGES_5.0.0.md>`__.

   - This release removes support for the ``Collection.insert()``,
     ``Collection.update()``, and ``Collection.remove()`` helper methods.
     The following list provides instructions on how to replace the
     functionality of the removed methods:

     - Migrate from ``Collection.insert()`` to ``insertOne()`` or ``insertMany()``
     - Migrate from ``Collection.update()`` to ``updateOne()`` or ``updateMany()``
     - Migrate from ``Collection.remove()`` to ``deleteOne()`` or ``deleteMany()``

   To view a full list of breaking changes introduced in this version, see the :ref:`Breaking
   Changes section <node-breaking-changes-v5.x>` in the Upgrade guide.

New features of the 5.0 {+driver-short+} release include:

- By default, the driver no longer checks types referenced in dot notation
  unless the ``StrictFilter`` type annotation is explicitly
  used. To learn more about this change, see the :ref:`Typescript fundamentals
  page <node-ts-type-safety>`.

  .. note::

     This change is for Typescript only, and does not affect queries or operations
     at runtime.

- Optional installation of ``@aws-sdk/credential-providers`` as a peer dependency.

  - The driver no longer includes AWS SDK modules by default. Use the
    following ``npm`` command to install the SDK:

    .. code-block:: bash

       npm install --save "@aws-sdk/credential-providers@^3.201.0"

    If you install the SDK, ``npm`` notifies you if the version of the SDK you
    installed is incompatible with the driver. Once you install the
    dependency successfully, the driver uses the AWS SDK itself to
    manage credentials from the environment.

.. _version-4.15:

What's New in 4.15
------------------

New features of the 4.15 {+driver-short+} release include:

- Support for AWS IAM roles for service accounts.

To learn more, see the `v4.15.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.15.0>`__.

.. _version-4.14:

What's New in 4.14
------------------

.. important:: Upgrade from v4.13 to v4.14

   This version includes a fix to a memory leak introduced in v4.13.
   We recommend upgrading to v4.14.

New features of the 4.14 {+driver-short+} release include:

- Fixed a memory leak introduced in v4.13.
- Deprecated methods and options that reference the legacy Logger.

.. _version-4.13:

What's New in 4.13
------------------

New features of the 4.13 {+driver-short+} release include:

- Automatic cancellation of in-flight operations in the connection pool when
  the driver encounters network timeout errors.
- Disabled causal consistency in implicit sessions to prevent conflicting
  with the ``linearizable`` and ``available`` read concern settings.
- Fixed a potential memory leak by ensuring that the driver destroys
  ``MessageStream`` instances whenever their connections are destroyed.

.. _version-4.12:

What's New in 4.12
------------------

.. important:: Upgrade Driver to Version 4.12.1

   The 4.12.1 {+driver-short+} includes a fix to a regression in monitoring logic
   that could cause processes to crash.

New features of the 4.12 {+driver-short+} release include:

- Redefinition of the ``ChangeStream`` class as an async iterable.
  You can use ``ChangeStream`` instances in any context that expects an
  ``AsyncIterator``.

  - Notably, change streams can now be used in Javascript ``for-await``
    loops:

    .. code-block:: js
       :copyable: false

       const changeStream = myColl.watch();
       for await (const change of changeStream) {
         console.log("Received change: ", change);
       }

- Fix to server monitoring when the driver skips monitoring events. In
  this release, the driver always updates its view of the topology when
  processing monitoring events.

- Performance improvements with buffering as a result of modification to
  data structures used internally in the driver.

To learn more, see the `v4.12.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.12.0>`__.

.. _version-4.11:

What's New in 4.11
------------------

Prioritization Order in Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When connecting to MongoDB Server version 6.0 or later, the driver prioritizes
``electionId`` settings before ``setVersion`` settings during Server Discovery and
Monitoring events. In previous versions, the prioritization order was reversed.

Changes to AWS Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you install the optional ``aws-sdk/credential-providers``
dependency, the driver uses the AWS SDK to retrieve AWS credentials from the
environment.

To learn more about this behavior, see the :ref:`MONGODB-AWS
<mongodb-aws>` section of the Authentication Mechanisms guide.

Mutually Recursive Schema Type Checking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release includes added support for **mutually
recursive** collection schema types. The driver also provides type safety for
dot-notation queries up to a depth of eight in this release. At a depth greater
than or equal to eight, Typescript successfully compiles your code but does not
provide type safety. This depth limit on recursive types is a current limitation
of TypeScript.

Example
```````

Suppose we have a collection of type ``Collection<Author>`` that contains the
following mutually recursive types:

.. code-block:: js
   :copyable: false

   interface Author {
       name: string;
       bestBook: Book;
   }

   interface Book {
       title: string;
       author: Author;
    }

TypeScript enforces type checking up to a depth of eight. The following
code causes a TypeScript compilation error because the ``name`` property
value must be a ``string`` type:

.. code-block:: js
   :copyable: false

   myColl.findOne({ 'bestBook.author.bestBook.title': 25 });

At a depth greater than or equal to eight, TypeScript compiles your code but no
longer type checks it. For example, the following code assigns a ``number`` to a
``string`` property but does not cause a compilation error because the
referenced property is at a depth of 10:

.. code-block:: js
   :copyable: false

   myColl.findOne({
       'bestBook.author.bestBook.author.bestBook.author.bestBook.author.bestBook.author.name': 25
   });

To learn more, see the `v4.11.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.11.0>`__.

.. _version-4.10:

What's New in 4.10
------------------

New features of the 4.10 {+driver-short+} release include:

- Callback Deprecation

  - Callbacks are now deprecated in favor of Promises. Callbacks will
    be removed in the next major release. The Node driver team recommends
    migrating to promises where possible:

    - Use ``async/await`` syntax.
    - Use the Node.js `callbackify utility <https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#utilcallbackifyoriginal>`__:

      .. code-block:: js

         require('util').callbackify(() => myColl.findOne())(callback)

    - Use :mdn:`then <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then>` syntax:

      .. code-block:: js

         myColl.findOne().then(res => callback(null, res), err => callback(err))

  - If you are unable to migrate to Promises in a large codebase, you can
    use the legacy `{+driver-short+} with optional callback support <https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-legacy>`__.

To learn more, see `v4.10.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.10.0>`__.

.. _version-4.9:

What's New in 4.9
-----------------

New features of the 4.9 {+driver-short+} release include:

- Fixed an inconsistency with ``writeConcern`` options in the type definitions.
- Included the latest BSON release, which adds automatic UUID support. See the
  BSON release notes `here <https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/releases/tag/v4.7.0>`__.

To learn more, see `v4.9.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.9.0>`__.

.. _version-4.8:

What's New in 4.8
-----------------

.. important:: Upgrade from v4.8.0 to v4.8.1

   Version 4.8.1 fixes a type regression issue introduced in v4.8.0. By
   upgrading to v4.8.1, you can specify ``_id`` values and sub-documents
   when performing updates with the ``$set`` or ``$setOnInsert`` operators.

New features of the 4.8 {+driver-short+} release include:

- Added auto-completion and type safety for nested keys in an update filter
- ``client.startSession()`` can now be called before connecting to MongoDB
- ``estimatedDocumentCount()`` method can now accept a comment

To learn more, see `v4.8.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.8.0>`__.

.. _version-4.7:

What's New in 4.7
-----------------

New features of the 4.7 {+driver-short+} release include:

- The ``MongoClient.connect()`` method is now optional when connecting to your MongoDB instance
- Ability to  compress messages with the ``Zstandard`` :ref:`compression algorithm <node-network-compression>`
- Added support for the ``maxConnecting`` connection option
- Ability for change stream documents to show your documents before and after an update
- Added support for new change stream fields related to Cluster to Cluster Replication
- The ``estimatedDocumentCount()`` method now uses the ``$count`` database command
- Improved connecting to MongoDB in the AWS Lambda Init phase

.. important:: Deprecation Notice

    The ``ResumeOptions`` interface is deprecated. Use the
    ``ChangeStreamCursorOptions`` interface instead.

.. _version-4.6:

What's New in 4.6
-----------------

New features of the 4.6 Node.js driver release include:

- Improved the ``ChangeStreamDocument`` in TypeScript.
- Even distribution of server selection based on load across servers.

To learn more, see `v4.6.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.6.0>`__.

.. _version-4.5:

What's New in 4.5
-----------------

See `v4.5.0 Release Highlights <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v4.5.0>`__
on GitHub.


.. _version-4.4:

What's New in 4.4
-----------------

New features of the 4.4 Node.js driver release include:

- KMIP provider support when using CSFLE.
- TLS support when using CSFLE.
- Hostname canonicalization now accepts "none", "forward", and "forwardAndReverse" as ``authMechanismProperties`` when using GSSAPI.
- In the 4.0.0 release of the driver, the deprecated ``collection.count()`` method was inadvertently changed to behave like ``collection.countDocuments()``.
  In this release, the ``collection.count()`` method is updated to match legacy behavior:

  - If a query is provided, ``collection.count()`` behaves the same as ``collection.countDocuments()`` and performs a collection scan.
  - If no query is  provided, ``collection.count()`` behaves the same as ``collection.estimatedDocumentCount()`` and relies on
    collection metadata.

  .. important:: Deprecation Notice

     The ``cursor.count()`` method is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version, along with ``collection.count()``.
     Use the ``collection.estimatedDocumentCount()`` or ``collection.countDocuments()``
     methods instead.

.. _version-4.3:

What's New in 4.3
-----------------

New features of the 4.3 Node.js driver release include:

- SOCKS5 support
- Option to :ref:`disable UTF-8 validation <nodejs-utf-8-validation>`
- Type inference for nested documents

.. _version-4.2:

What's New in 4.2
-----------------

New features of the 4.2 Node.js driver release include:

- ``srvMaxHosts`` and ``srvServiceName`` DNS seedlist :ref:`connection options <node-connection-options>`

.. _version-4.1:

What's New in 4.1
-----------------

New features of the 4.1 Node.js driver release include:

- Added load balanced connection support for all cluster types including
  the beta :ref:`Serverless platform <create-new-database-deployment>`.
- Added support for the ``advanceClusterTime()`` method to determine if
  the ``ClientSession`` should update its cluster time.

.. _version-4.0:

What's New in 4.0
-----------------

.. important::

   In this release of the driver, the deprecated ``collection.count()`` method was inadvertently changed to
   behave like ``collection.countDocuments()``. This behavior is corrected in :ref:`version 4.4 <version-4.4>`.

New features of the 4.0 Node.js driver release include:

TypeScript
~~~~~~~~~~

- We've migrated the driver to TypeScript. You can now harness the type
  hinting and intellisense features in editors that support it to develop
  your MongoDB applications. Enjoy the benefits of this work in pure JavaScript
  projects as well.

- The underlying BSON library used by this version is now migrated to
  TypeScript.

- Inline documentation is now consistently formatted to improve display
  in editors.

- If you are a user of the community types ``@types/mongodb``, there will
  **likely be issues** adopting the types from our codebase. We could not
  achieve a one to one match in types due to the details of writing the
  codebase in TypeScript.

We'd love to hear your TypeScript related feature requests. Please submit
ideas on our `JIRA project here <https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/NODE>`__.

Key Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Node.js Version
```````````````

The minimum supported version of Node.js is now v12.9 or greater for
version 4 of the driver. Support for our 3.x branches will continue
until summer 2022 to allow time to upgrade.

.. note::

   3.x supports back to Node.js v4.


Cursor Improvements
```````````````````

Our Cursor implementation is now updated to make it clear what is possible
before and after execution of an operation.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: js
      :copyable: False

      const fc = myColl.find({a: 2.3}).skip(1)
      for await (const doc of fc) {
        console.log(doc)
        fc.limit(1) // incorrect usage, cursor already executing
      }

There was inconsistency surrounding how the cursor would error if a
setting was applied after cursor execution began. Now, the cursor will
throw an error when attempting to apply operations in an invalid state,
similar to the following:

``MongoError: Cursor is already initialized``

- Affected classes:

  - ``AbstractCursor``
  - ``FindCursor``
  - ``AggregationCursor``
  - ``ChangeStreamCursor`` (This is the underlying cursor for ``ChangeStream``)
  - ``ListCollectionsCursor``

Cursor Stream API
+++++++++++++++++

Our Cursor types no longer extend ``Readable`` directly. They must be
transformed into a stream by calling ``cursor.stream()``.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: js
      :copyable: False

      const cursor = myColl.find({});
      const stream = cursor.stream();
      stream.on("data", data => console.log);
      stream.on("error", () => client.close());

Use ``hasNext()`` and ``next()`` for manual iteration.
Use ``for await of`` syntax or any ``Promise`` helpers for
asynchronous iteration.

``MongoClientOptions`` Interface
````````````````````````````````

With type hinting, you should find that options passed to a ``MongoClient``
are enumerated and discoverable. We've made a large effort to process
all options in the driver to give early warnings about incompatible settings
to get your app up and running in a correct state quickly.

- ``checkServerIdentity`` is no longer checked before being passed to the
  underlying Node API. Previously, accepted values were ``false``, or
  a function. Now, the argument must be a function. Specifying a
  boolean will result in an error being thrown.

- It is no longer required to specify ``useUnifiedTopology`` or ``useNewUrlParser``.

``createCollection()``
``````````````````````

This method no longer supports a ``strict`` option, which returned
an error if the collection did not exist. To assert the existence of
a collection, use the ``listCollections()`` method instead.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: js

      const collections = (await db.listCollections({}, { nameOnly: true })
        .toArray()).map(
          ({name}) => name
        );
      if (!collections.includes(myNewCollectionName)) {
        throw new Error(`${myNewCollectionName} doesn't exist`);
      }

``BulkWriteError`` → ``MongoBulkWriteError``
````````````````````````````````````````````

``BulkWriteError`` is now renamed to ``MongoBulkWriteError``.

When running bulk operations that make writes you can encounter errors
depending on your settings. Import the new class name ``MongoBulkWriteError``
when testing for errors in bulk operations.

``DB``
``````

``DB`` is no longer an ``EventEmitter``. Listen for events directly from your
``MongoClient`` instance.

``Collection.group()``
``````````````````````

The ``Collection.group()`` helper, deprecated since MongoDB 3.4,
is now removed. Use the aggregation pipeline :manual:`$group </reference/operator/aggregation/group/#pipe._S_group>`
operator instead.

Authentication
``````````````

- ``gssapiServiceName`` is now removed. Use `authMechanismProperties.SERVICE_NAME <{+api+}/interfaces/MongoClientOptions.html#authMechanismProperties>`__ in the URI or as an option on ``MongoClientOptions``.

  .. example::

     .. code-block:: js

        ?authMechanismProperties.SERVICE_NAME
        // or
        new MongoClient(url, { SERVICE_NAME: "alternateServiceName" })

- Specifying username and password as options is only supported in the URI
  or as an option on ``MongoClientOptions``.

  .. example::

     .. code-block:: js

        new MongoClient("mongodb://username:password@<host><port>")
        // or
        new MongoClient(url, { auth: { username: "<>", password: "<>" } })

``GridStore`` Removal
`````````````````````

The GridStore API (already deprecated in 3.x) is now replaced with ``GridFSBucket``.
For more information on ``GridFS``, see the :manual:`mongodb manual </core/gridfs>`.

Below are some snippets that represent equivalent operations.

Construction
++++++++++++

.. example::

   .. code-block:: javascript

      // old way
      const gs = new GridStore(db, filename, mode[, options])
      // new way
      const bucket = new GridFSBucket(client.db('test')[,options])

File Seeking
++++++++++++

GridFSBucket uses the Node.js Stream API. You can replicate file seeking
by using the ``start`` and ``end`` options, creating a download stream
from your ``GridFSBucket``.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: js

      bucket.openDownloadStreamByName(filename, { start: 0, end: 100 })

File Upload & Download
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. example::

   .. code-block:: javascript

      await client.connect();
      const filename = 'test.txt'; // whatever local file name you want
      const db = client.db();
      const bucket = new GridFSBucket(db);

      fs.createReadStream(filename)
        .pipe(bucket.openUploadStream(filename))
        .on('error', console.error)
        .on('finish', () => {
          console.log('done writing to db!');

          bucket
            .find()
            .toArray()

                  client.close();
                });
            });
        });

.. note::

   ``GridFSBucket`` does not need to be closed like ``GridStore``.

File Deletion
+++++++++++++

.. example::

   .. code-block:: js

      // old way
      GridStore.unlink(db, name, callback);
      // new way
      bucket.delete(file_id);

Finding File Metadata
+++++++++++++++++++++

File metadata that used to be accessible on the ``GridStore`` instance can be
found by querying the bucket.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: js

      const fileMetaDataList: GridFSFile[] = bucket.find({}).toArray();

Unified Topology
````````````````

- We internally now only manage a ``unifiedTopology`` when you connect
  to a ``mongod``. The differences between this and previous versions
  is `detailed here <https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/reference/unified-topology/>`__.

- It is no longer required to specify ``useUnifiedTopology`` or ``useNewUrlParser``.

- You must use the new ``directConnection`` `option <{+api+}/interfaces/MongoClientOptions.html#directConnection>`__
  to connect to uninitialized replica set members.

Explain
```````

Support is now added for fine-grained verbosity modes. You can learn more
about each mode :manual:`here </reference/method/cursor.explain/#behavior/>`.

Command Monitoring
``````````````````

The ``instrument()`` method is now removed. Use command monitoring instead.
See our guide on :doc:`command monitoring </fundamentals/monitoring/command-monitoring>`
for more information.
