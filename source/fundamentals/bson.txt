   :description: Learn how the MongoDB Go Driver handles BSON data conversion, including marshalling and unmarshalling, and how to use struct tags and BSON options.

Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about how the {+driver-short+} handles conversions
between BSON and Go types. The process of converting a Go type to
BSON is called **marshalling**, while the reverse process is called **unmarshalling**.

The following sections explain how the {+driver-short+} represents BSON data
and how you can adjust default marshalling and unmarshalling behaviors.

.. _golang-bson-types:

Data Types
----------

MongoDB stores documents in a binary representation called :manual:`BSON
</reference/bson-types/>` that allows for easy and flexible data processing.

The {+driver-short+} provides four main types for working with BSON data:

- ``D``: An ordered representation of a BSON document (slice)
- ``M``: An unordered representation of a BSON document (map)
- ``A``: An ordered representation of a BSON array
- ``E``: A single element inside a D type

The following example demonstrates how to construct a query filter by using the
``bson.D`` type to match documents in which the ``quantity`` field value is greater
than 100:

.. code-block:: go

   filter := bson.D{{"quantity", bson.D{{"$gt", 100}}}}

To learn more about how the {+driver-short+} handles BSON data, see the
`bson package API documentation <{+api+}/bson>`__.

.. _golang-struct-tags:

Struct Tags
-----------

In Go, a **struct** is a collection of data fields with declared data
types. You can modify the default marshalling and unmarshalling behavior of
a struct field by using **struct tags**, which are optional pieces of metadata
attached to struct fields. The most common use of struct tags is for specifying
the field name in the BSON document that corresponds to the struct field.
The following table describes the additional struct tags that you can
use in the {+driver-short+}:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Struct Tag
     - Description

   * - ``omitempty``
     - The field will not be marshaled if it is set to the zero value
       corresponding to the field type. To globally prevent the driver from 
       marshaling fields set to a zero value, you can set the ``OmitEmpty`` 
       BSON option. To learn more about how to set the ``OmitEmpty`` BSON option, 
       see the example in the :ref:`BSON Options <golang-bson-options>` 
       section of this page. 

   * - ``minsize``
     - If the field is type ``int64``, ``uint``, ``uint32``, or ``uint64`` and
       the value of the field can fit in a signed ``int32``, the field will be
       serialized as a BSON ``int32`` rather than a BSON ``int64``. If the value
       can't fit in a signed ``int32``, this tag is ignored.

   * - ``truncate``
     - If the field type is a non-float numeric type, BSON doubles
       unmarshalled into that field will be truncated at the decimal point.

   * - ``inline``
     - If the field type is a struct or map field, the field will be
       flattened when marshalling and unflattened when unmarshalling.

If you don't specify struct tags, the {+driver-short+} marshals structs by using
the following rules:

#. The driver only marshals and unmarshals exported fields.

#. The driver generates a BSON key by using the lowercase of the
   corresponding struct field.

#. The driver marshals embedded struct fields as subdocuments. Each key
   is the lowercase of the field's type.

#. The driver marshals a pointer field as the underlying type if the pointer
   is non-nil. If the pointer is nil, the driver marshals it as a BSON null
   value.

#. When unmarshalling, the {+driver-short+} follows `these D/M type mappings
   <{+api+}/bson#hdr-Native_Go_Types>`_
   for fields of type ``interface{}``. The driver unmarshals BSON documents
   unmarshalled into an ``interface{}`` field as a ``D`` type.

   .. tab:: Struct Tags
      :tabid: struct-tags

      The following example demonstrates how the {+driver-short+} marshals a
      struct with various struct tags:

      .. code-block:: go

         type Address struct {
         	Street string
         	City   string
         	State  string
         }

         type Student struct {
         	FirstName string  `bson:"first_name,omitempty"`
         	LastName  string  `bson:"last_name,omitempty"`
         	Address   Address `bson:"inline"`
         	Age       int
         }

         coll := client.Database("db").Collection("students")
         address1 := Address{ "1 Lakewood Way", "Elwood City", "PA" }
         student1 := Student{ FirstName : "Arthur", Address : address1, Age : 8}
         _, err = coll.InsertOne(context.TODO(), student1)

      The corresponding BSON representation looks like this:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false

         {
           "_id" : ObjectId("..."),
           "first_name" : "Arthur",
           "street" : "1 Lakewood Way",
           "city" : "Elwood City",
           "state" : "PA",
           "age" : 8
         }

      In this example, struct tags make the driver:

      - Set custom BSON field names such as ``first_name``
      - Omit the empty ``LastName`` field
      - Flatten the nested struct and bring all fields up to the top
        level

      .. tabs::

   .. tab:: No Struct Tags
      :tabid: no-struct-tags

      The following example demonstrates how the {+driver-short+} marshals
      a struct without any struct tags:

      .. code-block:: go

         type Address struct {
         	Street string
         	City   string
         	State  string
         }

         type Student struct {
         	FirstName string
         	LastName  string
         	Address   Address
         	Age       int
         }

         coll := client.Database("db").Collection("students")
         address1 := Address{ "1 Lakewood Way", "Elwood City", "PA" }
         student1 := Student{ FirstName : "Arthur", Address : address1, Age : 8}
         _, err = coll.InsertOne(context.TODO(), student1)

      The corresponding BSON representation looks like this:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false

         {
           "_id" : ObjectId("..."),
           "firstname" : "Arthur",
           "lastname" : "",
           "address": {
                        "street" : "1 Lakewood Way",
                        "city" : "Elwood City",
                        "state" : "PA"
                      },
           "age" : 8
         }

      Without struct tags, the driver:

      - Sets the lowercase of the struct fields as the BSON field names
      - Includes an empty ``lastname`` field
      - Stores the ``Address`` field as a nested value

.. _golang-bson-options:

BSON Options
------------

You can specify BSON options to adjust the marshalling and unmarshalling behavior of
your ``Client`` instance. To set BSON options on your ``Client``, create and configure
a ``BSONOptions`` instance.
 
This example performs the following actions:

- Creates a ``BSONOptions`` instance by configuring the following settings:
  
  - Sets the ``UseJSONStructTags`` field to ``true``, which instructs the driver
    to use the ``"json"`` struct tag if a ``"bson"`` struct tag is not specified
  - Sets the ``NilSliceAsEmpty`` field to ``true``, which instructs the driver
    to marshal ``nil`` Go slices as empty BSON arrays
  - Sets the ``OmitEmpty`` field to ``true``, which instructs the driver to globally omit
    empty values from the marshaled BSON, rather than set empty values to ``null`` 

- Passes the ``BSONOptions`` instance to the ``SetBSONOptions()`` helper method to specify
  a ``ClientOptions`` instance
- Creates a ``Client`` to apply the specified BSON marshalling and unmarshalling behavior

.. code-block:: go

   bsonOpts := &options.BSONOptions {
       UseJSONStructTags: true,
       NilSliceAsEmpty: true,
       OmitEmpty: true,
   }

   clientOpts := options.Client().
       ApplyURI("<connection string>").
       SetBSONOptions(bsonOpts)

   client, err := mongo.Connect(clientOpts)

.. tip::    

   To learn more about the ``BSONOptions`` type, see the
   `BSONOptions API documentation <{+api+}/mongo/options#BSONOptions>`__.
   For an example that specifies a ``BSONOptions`` instance and creates a client with 
   these options, see the `Connect() BSONOptions example
   <{+api+}/mongo#example-Connect-BSONOptions>`__.

.. _golang-bson-unmarshalling:

Unmarshalling
-------------

You can unmarshal BSON documents by using the ``Decode()`` method on the
result of the ``FindOne`` method or any ``*mongo.Cursor`` instance.

The ``Decode()`` method returns an ``error`` type which
contains one of the following values:

- ``nil`` if a document matched your query, and there were no errors
  retrieving and unmarshalling the document.
- If the driver retrieved your document but could not unmarshal your result, the
  ``Decode()`` method returns the unmarshalling error.
- If there was an error retrieving your document during execution of the
  ``FindOne()`` method, the error propagates to the ``Decode()`` method and
  the ``Decode()`` method returns the error.

When used on the ``SingleResult`` type returned by the ``FindOne()``
method, ``Decode()`` can also return the ``ErrNoDocuments`` error if no
documents matched the query filter.

The following example demonstrates how you can use the ``Decode()``
method to unmarshal and read the result of a simple ``FindOne()``
operation:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: go

      coll := client.Database("db").Collection("students")
      filter := bson.D{{"age", 8}}

      var result bson.D
      err := coll.FindOne(context.TODO(), filter).Decode(&result)

      fmt.Println(result)

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      [{_id ObjectID("...")} {first_name Arthur} {street 1 Fern Way} {city Elwood City} {state PA} {age 8}]

The ``Cursor`` type also uses the ``All()`` method, which unmarshals all
documents stored in the cursor into an array at the same time.

The ``bson`` package includes a family of ``Marshal()`` and ``Unmarshal()``
methods that work with BSON-encoded data of ``[]byte`` type.

The following code demonstrates how you can unmarshal BSON back into a
user-defined struct by using methods from the ``bson`` package:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: go

      type Item struct {
         Category string
         Quantity int32
      }

      doc, err := bson.Marshal(bson.D{{"category", "plate"}, {"quantity", 6}})

      var test Item
      err = bson.Unmarshal(doc, &test)

      fmt.Printf("Unmarshalled Struct:\n%+v\n", test)

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Unmarshalled Struct:
      {Category:plate Quantity:6}

.. note::

   You can use the ``Raw`` type to retrieve elements from a BSON
   document byte slice without unmarshalling it to a Go type. This type
   allows you to look up individual elements without unmarshalling
   the entire BSON document.

To learn more about the marshalling and unmarshalling methods used with the
``Cursor`` type, see the `Cursor API documentation <{+api+}/mongo#Cursor>`__

``bson`` package, see the `bson API documentation
