Overview
--------

|mms| Automation lets you build MongoDB indexes without downtime for
your deployment. The Automation Agent will sequentially take each
individual node in a replica set or cluster offline to build the
indexes. The agent builds the indexes without increasing load on your
deployment or blocking read or write operations. You can create any
type of MongoDB index. For available types, see 
:ref:`Index Types <index-types>` in the MongoDB manual.

.. warning::

   The Automation Agent does not currently support automated removal of
   an index from a collection. To remove an index that is managed by
   the Automation Agent, you must first remove the index from
   Automation and then manually remove the index from the collection.
   See the :ref:`remove-index` procedures below.
