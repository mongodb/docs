  a. Create a file named ``SortByNumbers.java``.
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the ``SortByNumbers.java`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:

     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-sort-by-numbers-constant-desc.rst 

       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-sort-by-numbers-stage.rst

     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.

     .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/sort/numbers-query.java

     .. note:: 

        To run the sample code in your Maven environment, add the 
        following code above the import statements in your file.

        .. code-block:: 

           package com.mongodb.drivers;

  #. .. include:: /includes/fts/facts/fact-fts-driver-connection-string.rst
  #. Compile and run the ``SortByNumbers.java`` file.

     .. io-code-block::
        :copyable: true

        .. input::
           :language: shell 

           javac SortByNumbers.java
           java SortByNumbers
