msgid "If the :rsconf:`settings.chainingAllowed` setting allows secondary members to sync from other secondaries, MongoDB by default prefers non-hidden members over hidden members when selecting a sync target. MongoDB will only choose hidden members as a last resort. If you want a secondary to sync from a hidden member, use the :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` database command to override the default sync target. See the documentation for :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` before using the command."

msgid "The following example hides the secondary member currently at the index ``0`` in the :rsconf:`members` array. To configure a :term:`hidden member`, use the following sequence of operations in a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected to the primary, specifying the member to configure by its array index in the :rsconf:`members` array:"

#: ../source/includes/fact-rs-conf-array-index.rst:1

#: ../source/includes/warning-rs-reconfig.rst:3
msgid "The :method:`rs.reconfig()` shell method can force the current primary to step down, which causes an :ref:`election <replica-set-elections>`. When the primary steps down, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` closes all client connections. While this typically takes 10-20 seconds, try to make these changes during scheduled maintenance periods."
