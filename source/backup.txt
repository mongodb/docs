The MMS Backup Service is a system that creates backups of
MongoDB replica sets and sharded clusters. A lightweight agent runs
within your infrastructure and captures data from your MongoDB
deployment using the same mechanism as replication. 
The Backup Service hosts the backup data and snapshots using its own
infrastructure.

The MMS Backup Service is currently in limited release, and is fully
integrated with :doc:`MMS Monitoring </monitoring>`.

This manual describes the process for registering and activating the
backup service, the process for installing the backup agent, and the
basic procedures for enabling backups and restoring from a backup.
