  You can integrate MongoDB with |langgraph-link|
  to build AI agents and advanced |rag| applications. 
  This page provides an overview of the MongoDB |langgraph| integration and how you 
  can use MongoDB for both retrieval and agent state persistence in your LangGraph
  workflows.

  LangGraph is a specialized framework within the LangChain ecosystem 
  designed for building AI agents and complex multi-agent workflows.
  |graphs-link| are the core components of LangGraph, representing the workflow 
  of your agent. The MongoDB LangGraph integration enables 
  the following capabilities: 

  - **Retrieval Tools**: You can use the MongoDB LangChain 
    integration to quickly create retrieval tools for your LangGraph workflows.

  - **MongoDB Checkpointer**: You can persist the state of your LangGraph agents 
    in MongoDB, providing conversation memory and fault tolerance.

  Integrating your LangGraph applications with MongoDB allows you to consolidate 
  both retrieval capabilities and agent state persistence in a single database,
  simplifying your architecture and reducing operational complexity.
