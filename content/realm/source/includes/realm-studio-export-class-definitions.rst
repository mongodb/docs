To export updated class definitions:

- Go to :guilabel:`File` > :guilabel:`Save model definitions`, and select
  your preferred language. Supported languages include: Swift, JavaScript,
  TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, and C#. 
- Specify a name and destination for your new class definitions. Press
  the :guilabel:`Save` button.

If your destination directory does not already exist, Realm Studio creates 
it. Inside, you'll find a file that contains a complete list of classes 
and properties, including new additions.
