You can verify which Linux distribution you are running by running the
following command on the command-line:

.. code-block:: none

   grep ^NAME  /etc/*release

The result should be **Amazon Linux** or **Amazon Linux AMI**. If using
a different Linux distribution, please see the
:doc:`install instructions for your platform
</administration/install-enterprise-linux>`.
