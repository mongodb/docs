:red:`WARNING:` If you shard a collection that already has an |fts| index, 
you might experience a brief period of query downtime when the collection
begins to appear on a shard. Also, if you add a shard for an already
sharded collection that contains an |fts| index, your search queries
against that collection will fail until the initial sync process
completes on the added shards. To learn more, see :ref:`initial sync process 
<troubleshoot-initial-sync>`.
