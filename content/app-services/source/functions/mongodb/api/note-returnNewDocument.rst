.. note::

   You can specify whether to return the pre-replacement or
   post-replacement version of the document by setting the value of
   ``options.returnNewDocument``. By default, ``returnNewDocument`` is
   ``false``, which indicates that the promise should resolve to the
   *pre-update* version of the document.
