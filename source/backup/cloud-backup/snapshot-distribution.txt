You can configure |service| to automatically create copies of your
snapshots and oplogs and store them in other regions. With snapshots
distributed across multiple regions, you can still restore your 
{+cluster+} if the primary region goes down, enhancing your disaster 
recovery capabilities to bring them in line with internal or regulatory
requirements. Additionally, |service| can perform optimized direct 
attach restores rather than slower streaming restores for {+clusters+} 
based in the same project and regions where you store copies. This 
reduces system recovery time.

If you need to restore your {+cluster+}, |service| decides whether to
use the original snapshot or a copied snapshot for optimal restore
speeds. |service| might use copied snapshots to optimize restore if you 
are restoring a {+cluster+} in the same region as a snapshot copy, 
including multi-region {+clusters+} if the snapshots were copied to 
every {+cluster+} region. Additionally, if the original snapshot 
becomes unavailable due to a regional outage within your cloud 
provider, |service| uses a copy in the nearest region to enable 
restores regardless of the cloud region outage.

.. note::

   If you have a :ref:`{+bcp+} enabled <backup-compliance-policy>` with
   the :guilabel:`Keep all snapshots when removing additional snapshot regions` 
   option set to :guilabel:`On` and you enable, modify, or delete 
   multi-region snapshots, any snapshots already taken remain.

You can use copied oplogs to perform {+pit-restore+} from secondary
regions in the event the primary region of your {+cluster+} goes down.

Required Access
---------------

To modify or delete backup policies, you must have
:authrole:`Project Backup Manager` or :authrole:`Project Owner` 
access to the project. Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` 
access must add themselves as a ``Project Backup Manager`` or
``Project Owner`` to the project before they can modify or delete 
backup policies.

Procedure
---------

To configure automatic snapshot distribution in other regions:

1. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Backup Policy` tab. In the 
   :guilabel:`Additional Backup Copies` section, click the arrow button 
   to expand the pane.

#. Toggle :guilabel:`Copy to other regions` on. You will see a table of 
   distribution policies pre-populated with the cluster's current 
   regions.
   
   .. note::

      For a global {+cluster+}, you can enable or disable this setting
      independently for each zone.

#. In the :guilabel:`Copy to other regions` table, click 
   :guilabel:`Choose a region` in the :guilabel:`Region` column of the 
   row under your current region and select the region to distribute 
   snapshots to.

   .. note::

      You can select regions only for the same cloud provider as the 
      primary region. For example, if your {+cluster+} is in the |aws| 
      ``us-east-1`` region, you can distribute snapshots only to other 
      |aws| regions supported by |service|. For global {+clusters+}, 
      each zone may have nodes in multiple cloud providers. When you 
      select regions in which to store copied snapshots, you can select 
      only regions in the same cloud provider as the zone's primary
      region.

#. In the :guilabel:`Snapshots` column, click the arrow to view the 
   available snapshot policies for the cluster. |service| displays
   options based on the backup policies for the cluster.

   For example, if you set the {+cluster+} with a :guilabel:`Daily`
   backup policy of taking daily 5:00 PM snapshots, checking
   :guilabel:`Daily` in the :guilabel:`Snapshots` column enables 
   snapshot distribution of daily 5:00 PM snapshots. You can't set the 
   snapshot distribution policy to a different frequency or timing than 
   its underlying backup policy.
   
   .. note::
      
      .. include:: /includes/fact-overlapping-backup-policy-items.rst

   You can enable or disable any combination of the available policies
   on a region-by-region basis.

   .. example::

      The following table describes the snapshot distribution policy
      for a {+cluster+} with enabled storage nodes in the |aws| regions
      ``us-east-2``, ``us-west-1``, and ``us-west-2``:

#. If you enabled {+PIT-Restore+} for the cluster, you can
   enable oplog distribution for each additional region. If you 
   disabled {+PIT-Restore+} for the cluster, you can't enable oplog
   distribution for additional regions.

To delete a policy for snapshot distribution to other regions:

1. In the :guilabel:`Action` column, click :icon:`trash-alt`.
   
2. In the dialog box, select either
   :guilabel:`Keep all snapshots in this region` or
   :guilabel:`Delete all snapshots in this region`, and click
   :guilabel:`Confirm`. If you choose to keep snapshots in
   a disabled region, the snapshots persist until their
   scheduled expiration date.

Alternatively, to disable all snapshot distribution policies
within a single-region {+cluster+} or within a global {+cluster+} zone,
click the :guilabel:`Copy to other regions` toggle. As with deleting
an individual policy, you can choose to keep or delete all copied
snapshots for that {+cluster+} or zone.

.. note::
   
   In the event of a cloud provider service outage in a region 
   configured for automatic snapshot distribution, |service| will 
   attempt restore using snapshots stored in copy regions.
