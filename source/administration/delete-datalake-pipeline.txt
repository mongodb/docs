===============================
Delete {+adl+} Pipeline 
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can delete your {+dl+} pipeline at any time from 
the |service| |ui|, {+dl+} Pipelines |api|, and the {+atlas-cli+}. 
When you delete your {+dl+} pipeline, |service| deletes all underlying 
datasets, including the data, and removes the {+dl+} datasets from your 
federated database instances where it's referenced. 
You can't undo this operation.

      endpoint with the name of the pipeline that you want to delete. To 
      learn more about the ``pipelines`` endpoint syntax and parameters for 
      deleting a pipeline, see :oas-atlas-op:`Remove One Data Lake Pipeline 
      </removeOneDataLakePipeline>`.
