Aggregation operations process multiple documents and return computed
results. You can use aggregation operations to:

- Group values from multiple documents together.

- Perform operations on the grouped data to return a single result.

- Analyze data changes over time.

To perform aggregation operations, you can use:

- :ref:`Aggregation pipelines <aggregation-pipeline-intro>`, which are
  the preferred method for performing aggregations.

- :ref:`Single purpose aggregation methods
  <single-purpose-agg-methods>`, which are simple but lack the
  capabilities of an aggregation pipeline.

Single Purpose Aggregation Methods
----------------------------------

The single purpose aggregation methods aggregate documents from a single
collection. The methods are simple but lack the capabilities of an
aggregation pipeline.

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - :method:`db.collection.estimatedDocumentCount()`
     - Returns an approximate count of the documents in a collection or
       a view.

   * - :method:`db.collection.count()`
     - Returns a count of the number of documents in a collection or a
       view.

   * - :method:`db.collection.distinct()`
     - Returns an array of documents that have distinct values for the
       specified field.
