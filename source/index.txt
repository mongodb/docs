About |service| |data-lake|
---------------------------

MongoDB |service| |data-lake| allows you to natively query and analyze data 
across |aws| |s3| and MongoDB |service|. You can query your richly structured 
data stored in |json|, |bson|, CSV, TSV, Avro, ORC, and Parquet formats using 
the |mongo| shell, :dl:`MongoDB Compass <compass>`, or any 
:driver:`MongoDB driver </>` without data movement or transformation.

|data-lake| Access 
------------------

When you create a |data-lake|, you grant |service| either read only or 
read and write access to |s3| buckets in your |aws| account. To access your 
|service| clusters, |service| uses your existing :manual:`Role Based Access 
Controls</core/authorization>`. You can view and edit the generated data 
storage :ref:`configuration <datalake-configuration-file>` that maps data from 
your |s3| buckets and |service| clusters to virtual databases and collections.

A database user must have one of the following roles to query an |service| 
|data-lake|:

- :atlas:`readWriteAnyDatabase </security-add-mongodb-users/#readWriteAnyDatabase>`

- :atlas:`readAnyDatabase </security-add-mongodb-users/#readAnyDatabase>`

- A :atlas:`custom role </security-add-mongodb-roles/>` with the  
  :manual:`find </reference/privilege-actions/>` privilege

.. _atlas-data-lake-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

Verify that you meet the following prerequisites before you create a |data-lake|:

* One or more |aws| |s3| buckets in the same |aws| account.

* An |aws| CLI configured to access your |aws| account. Alternatively, you must 
  have access to the |aws| Management Console with permission to create `IAM roles 
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html>`_.

  .. note:

   To prevent excessive charges on your bill, create your |service|
   |data-lake| in the same |aws| region as your |s3| data source.

.. _atlas-data-lake-billing:

Billing
-------

|service| |data-lake| incurs costs for the amount of data processed and
returned by the service.

Total Data Processed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for the total number of bytes that |data-lake| 
processes from your |aws| S3 buckets, rounded up to the nearest megabyte.
|service| charges **$5.00 per TB** of processed data, with a minimum of
**10 MB** or **$0.00005 per query**.

You can use partitioning strategies and compression in |aws| |s3| to
reduce the amount of data processed.

Total Data Returned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for the total number of bytes returned by
|data-lake|. This total is the sum of the following data transfers:

- The number of bytes transferred between |data-lake| service nodes
- The number of bytes transferred from |data-lake| to the client

Returned data is billed as outlined in the :guilabel:`Data Transfer
Fees` section of the `Atlas pricing page 
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/pricing?tck=docs_atlas>`_. The 
cost of data transfer depends on the Cloud Service Provider charges 
for same-region, region-to-region, or region-to-internet data transfer.
