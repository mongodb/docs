msgid "Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections <collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. Decisions that affect how you model data can affect application performance and database capacity. See :doc:`/core/data-models` for a full high level overview of data modeling in MongoDB."

msgid "Consider the following example that maps patron and multiple address relationships. The example illustrates the advantage of embedding over referencing if you need to view many data entities in context of another. In this one-to-many relationship between ``patron`` and ``address`` data, the ``patron`` has multiple ``address`` entities."

msgid "If your application frequently retrieves the ``address`` data with the ``name`` information, then your application needs to issue multiple queries to resolve the references. A more optimal schema would be to embed the ``address`` data entities in the ``patron`` data, as in the following document:"
