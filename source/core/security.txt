.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

.. only:: saas

   |MMS| provides configurable encryption, authentication, and
   authorization to ensure the security of your |MMS| agents and MongoDB
   deployments. |MMS| supports SSL, LDAP, Kerberos, and MONGODB-CR.

.. only:: hosted

   |MMS| provides configurable encryption, authentication, and
   authorization to ensure the security of your |MMS| agents, |MMS|
   deployments, and MongoDB deployments. |MMS| supports SSL, LDAP,
   Kerberos, and MONGODB-CR.

Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~

|MMS| supports SSL for encrypting the following Monitoring Agent and
Backup Agent connections:

- Connections to MongoDB instances

- Connections to |MMS| servers

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authentication verifies an agent's identity to a MongoDB deployment or to
|MMS|. |MMS| supports multiple :manual:`authentication mechanism
</core/authentication>`, including LDAP and MONGODB-CR, the MongoDB
default mechanism. |MMS| supports agent authentication on two types of
connections:

- Authentication to MongoDB.

- Authentication to |MMS|.

Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| provides roles to control access to resources and operations. Roles
determine an agent's or user's access to |mms| resources and operations.
See :ref:`assigning-roles-to-users`.

SSL
---

SSL encrypts the connections made by Monitoring Agents and Backup Agents
to both MongoDB instances and to |MMS| servers. SSL encryption ensures
communications are readable only by the intended parties.

.. only:: saas

   Agents always use SSL when communicating with the |MMS| servers. You
   can also apply SSL to agent communications with your MongoDB
   deployments.

.. only:: hosted

   Both the Monitoring Agent and the Backup Agent can use SSL. You can
   apply SSL to their communications with the MongoDB deployment and,
   separately, to their communications with the |MMS| servers.

To implement SSL on your agent connections, please see :doc:`/core/ssl`.

LDAP Authentication
-------------------

You can implement LDAP for agent authentication to both your MongoDB
instances and to |MMS|.

To activate LDAP authentication to a MongoDB instance, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-for-ldap-authentication`

- :doc:`/tutorial/backup-deployments-with-auth`

- :doc:`/tutorial/connect-to-hosts-with-ldap-authentication`

- :doc:`/reference/authentication`

To activate LDAP authentication to |MMS|, see

:doc:`/tutorial/configure-for-ldap-authentication`.

MONGODB-CR
----------

You can implement MONGODB-CR authentication for agent connections to both
your MongoDB instances and to |MMS|. See:

- :doc:`/tutorial/backup-deployments-with-auth`

- :doc:`/reference/authentication`

Kerberos
--------

To activate Kerberos authentication, you must select an authentication
mechanism and provide the credentials. You can do so when first adding a
host or activating a backup in |MMS|, or later after the host monitoring
and backup are active.

See :doc:`/tutorial/connect-to-hosts-with-kerberos-authentication`

Two-Factor Authentication
-------------------------

To activate two-factor authentication, see:

- :doc:`/core/two-factor-authentication`

- :doc:`/tutorial/manage-two-factor-authentication`
