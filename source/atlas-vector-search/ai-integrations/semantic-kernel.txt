.. note::

   This tutorial uses the Semantic Kernel :github:`Python library
   </microsoft/semantic-kernel/tree/main/python/semantic_kernel/connectors/memory/mongodb_atlas>`.
   For a tutorial that uses the C# library, see :ref:`semantic-kernel-csharp`.

.. tip::

   Work with a runnable version of this tutorial as a
   :github:`Python notebook <mongodb/docs-notebooks/blob/main/integrations/semantic-kernel.ipynb?tck=docs>`.

Background
----------

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/semantic-kernel/sk-background.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial, you must have the following:

- .. include:: /includes/avs-examples/shared/avs-requirements-cluster.rst

- .. include:: /includes/avs-examples/shared/avs-requirements-openai-api-key.rst

- An environment to run interactive Python notebooks 
  such as `Colab <https://colab.research.google.com>`__.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-colab-ip-address.rst

Set Up the Environment
----------------------

.. include:: /includes/set-up-python-notebook-environment.rst

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/semantic-kernel/sk-set-up-environment.rst

Store Custom Data in |service|
------------------------------

In this section, you initialize the `kernel
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/agents/kernel/>`__,
which is the main interface used to manage your
application's services and plugins. Through the kernel, you configure your
AI services, instantiate |service| as a vector database (also called a memory
store), and load custom data into your |service| {+cluster+}.

To store custom data in |service|, paste and
run the following code snippets in your notebook:

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/semantic-kernel/sk-store-custom-data.rst

Create the {+avs+} Index
------------------------------------

.. note:: 

   To create an {+avs+} index, you must have :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` 
   or higher access to the |service| project.

To enable vector search queries on your vector store,
run the following code in your notebook to 
create an {+avs+} index on the ``semantic_kernel_db.test`` collection.

.. code-block:: python

   # Connect to your Atlas cluster and specify the collection
   client = MongoClient(ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING)
   collection = client["semantic_kernel_db"]["test"]

   # Create your index model, then create the search index
   search_index_model = SearchIndexModel(
      definition={
         "fields": [
            {
            "type": "vector",
            "path": "embedding",
            "numDimensions": 1536,
            "similarity": "cosine"
            }
         ]
      },
      name="vector_index",
      type="vectorSearch"
   )

   collection.create_search_index(model=search_index_model)

The index definition indexes the ``embedding`` field as 
the :ref:`vector <avs-types-vector-search>` type. 
The ``embedding`` field contains the embeddings
created using OpenAI's ``text-embedding-ada-002`` embedding model. 
The index definition specifies ``1536`` vector dimensions 
and measures similarity using ``cosine``.

Run Vector Search Queries
-------------------------

Once |service| builds your index, you can run vector search
queries on your data.

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/semantic-kernel/sk-query-examples.rst

Answer Questions on Your Data
-----------------------------

This section shows an example |rag| implementation
with {+avs+} and Semantic Kernel. Now that you've used {+avs+}
to retrieve semantically similar documents, run the following code example
to prompt the |llm| to answer questions based on those documents.

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/semantic-kernel/sk-perform-qa.rst
