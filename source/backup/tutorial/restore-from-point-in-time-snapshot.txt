Restore Replica Set from a Point in the Last 24 Hours
=====================================================

.. start-content

With the MongoDB Backup Service, you can restore from any point within
a 24-hour period as well as :doc:`restore from a stored snapshot
</backup/tutorial/restore-from-snapshot>`.

.. important:: For replica sets these restores reflect a single point
   in time. For sharded clusters, the Backup service only restores
   sharded clusters from a :doc:`stored snapshot
   </backup/tutorial/restore-from-snapshot/>`, which reflect *nearly*
   the same moment for each shard. The Backup service will not build a
   custom snapshot for a sharded cluster.
