  a. Create a file named ``simple_query.py``. 
  #. Copy and paste the code example into the ``simple_query.py`` file.

     The following code example:

     - Imports ``pymongo``, MongoDB's Python driver, and the ``dns``
       module, which is required to connect ``pymongo`` to ``Atlas`` using
       a |dns| seed list connection string. 
     - Creates an instance of the ``MongoClient`` class to establish a 
       connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Searches for the word ``baseball`` in
       the ``plot`` field. It includes a :manual:`$limit
       </reference/operator/aggregation/limit>` stage to limit the 
       output to 5 results and a :manual:`$project
       </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` stage to exclude all
       fields except ``title`` and ``plot``.
     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.

  a. Create a file named ``complex-query.py``. 
  #. Copy and paste the code example into the ``complex-query.py`` file.

     ``$search`` has several :ref:`operators <fts-operators>` for
     constructing different types of queries. The following query 
     uses the :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operator to combine 
     several operators into a single query. It has the following 
     search criteria:

     - The ``plot`` field must contain either ``Hawaii`` or 
       ``Alaska``.
     - The ``plot`` field must contain a four-digit number, such as a
       year.
     - The ``genres`` field must not contain either ``Comedy`` or
       ``Romance``.
     - The ``title`` field must not contain ``Beach`` or ``Snow``.
