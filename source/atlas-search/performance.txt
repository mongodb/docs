|fts| runs a new process, called ``mongot``, alongside
the :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` process on each host in your
|service| cluster. ``mongot`` maintains all
|fts| indexes on collections in your |service| databases.
The amount of CPU, memory, and disk resources ``mongot`` consumes
depends on several factors, including our index configuration and 
the complexity of your queries. 
:ref:`Atlas Search alerts <atlas-search-alerts>` measure the amount of
CPU and memory used by |fts| processes.

The following pages contain recommendations that you can apply when
configuring your |fts| index and defining your |fts| queries to improve
performance: 

- :ref:`Atlas Search Index Performance <index-perf>`
- :ref:`Atlas Search Query Performance <query-perf>`

.. important:: Upgrading to NVMe Storage

   Upgrading an |service| {+cluster+} to use NVMe triggers an 
   :ref:`initial sync <troubleshoot-initial-sync>` on that {+cluster+}. 
   |fts| is unavailable until both the ``mongod`` and ``mongot`` 
   finish their initial syncs.
