=====================
Data Center Awareness
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB provides a number of features that allow application
developers and database administrators to customize the behavior of a
:term:`sharded cluster` or :term:`replica set` deployment so that
MongoDB may be *more* "data center aware," or allow operational
and location-based separation.

MongoDB also supports segregation based
on functional parameters, to ensure that certain :program:`mongod`
instances are only used for reporting workloads or that certain
high-frequency portions of a sharded collection only exist on specific
shards.
