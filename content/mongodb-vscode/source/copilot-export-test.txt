You can use the :ref:`MongoDB Extension for Github Copilot
<vsce-copilot>` to export and test your application queries in
playgrounds. 

.. note::

   The :guilabel:`Export Code to Playground` feature is only available
   if you enable |copilot|. 

Export to Playground
--------------------

Use the following steps to test your application code in a playground:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
   
   .. step:: Open the project file that contains the MongoDB query that you want to export.

   .. step:: Highlight the query that you want to test.

   .. step:: Right-click to select :guilabel:`Export Code to Playground`.

      Right-click your selected code to open the options menu.
      Click :guilabel:`MongoDB Copilot Extension` >
      :guilabel:`Export Code to Playground`.

      When you click :guilabel:`Export Code to Playground`, |vscode-short|
      opens a new playground with your selected code in MongoDB shell
      syntax. 

Once you export your code to a playground, you can click
:icon-fa5:`play` on the top right of your window to run your query. 

You can also convert your code to a driver language with the
:ref:`Export to Language <vsce-export-to-language>` feature.
