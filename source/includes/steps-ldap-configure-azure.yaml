title: "Configure |ldap-provider| for your domain."
level: 4
ref: configure-azure-ldap-adds-domain
content: |

  To configure |ldap-provider|, follow the 
  :azure:`Create an advanced managed domain 
  </active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance-advanced>` 
  tutorial in the |azure| Documentation using the 
  ``Custom domain names`` DNS name option.

  When you configure your managed domain, make sure that you note the 
  value you enter in the :guilabel:`DNS domain name` field. This value 
  is your ``<managed-domain>``. You must provide it in several places in 
  this tutorial.

  .. example::

     aadds.example.com

title: "Obtain an SSL certificate for secure LDAP."
level: 4
ref: configure-azure-ldap-cert
content: |

  |ldap-provider| uses SSL certificates to secure LDAP. Your certificate 
  must adhere to the requirements outlined in the :azure:`Azure Documentation 
  </active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-configure-ldaps#create-a-certificate-for-secure-ldap>`.

  To obtain a certificate, either:

  - Get one from the public or enterprise certificate authority (CA) your 
    organization uses.

    - You must obtain a wildcard certificate to ensure secure LDAP works 
      properly with |ldap-provider|.
    - The certificate's subject name must match the ``<managed-domain>`` 
      you used when you configured |ldap-provider|.

      .. example::

        \*.aadds.example.com

  - Generate a self-signed certificate. Self-signed certificates are not 
    recommended for production.

  To generate a self-signed certificate on MacOS or Linux systems **for 
  testing purposes**:

  .. note::

     If you are on macOS Catalina, install the latest version of
     ``openssl``. Run the following command to install using Homebrew:

     .. code-block:: sh

        brew install openssl

  a. Generate a private key with ``openssl``. The following command 
     generates a private key file named ``<your-key-name>.key``:

     .. code-block:: sh

        openssl genrsa -out <your-key-name>.key 2048

  #. Edit the following configuration file template. Update the 
     attributes in the ``[dn-param]`` section with values that relate 
     to your organization. Make sure the subject name (``CN``) matches 
     the following template: ``*.<managed-domain>``

     .. example::

        \*.aadds.example.com

     .. code-block:: sh
        :emphasize-lines: 8-14

        # openssl x509 extfile params
        extensions = extend
    
        [req] # openssl req params
        prompt = no
        distinguished_name = dn-param
    
        [dn-param] # DN fields
        C = US
        ST = NY
        L  = New York
        O = MongoDB
        OU = Atlas
        CN = *.aadds.example.com
    
        [extend] # openssl extensions
        subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
        authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always
        keyUsage = digitalSignature,keyEncipherment,keyCertSign
        extendedKeyUsage=serverAuth,clientAuth

  #. Save the file as ``<your-config-name>.cfg``.

  #. Generate a certificate signing request using the key and 
     configuration files you created. The following command generates a 
     certificate signing request named ``<your-csr-name>.csr``:

     .. code-block:: sh

        openssl req -new -key <your-key-name>.key \
        -out <your-csr-name>.csr -config <your-config-name>.cfg \
        -extensions extend

  #. Generate a self-signed certificate using key, configuration, and 
     certificate signing request files you created. The following 
     command generates a self-signed certificate file named 
     ``<your-cert-name>.crt``:

     .. code-block:: sh
     
        openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -in <your-csr-name>.csr \
        -signkey <your-key-name>.key -out <your-cert-name>.crt \
        -extfile <your-config-name>.cfg     

  To generate a self-signed certificate on a Windows system **for testing 
  purposes**, see the :azure:`Azure documentation 
  </active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-configure-ldaps#create-a-certificate-for-secure-ldap>`.

title: "Obtain an SSL certificate that includes your private key."
level: 4
ref: configure-azure-ldap-pk-cert
content: |

  |ldap-provider| uses private keys to decrypt secure LDAP traffic. 
  Certificates that include private keys use the ``PKCS#12`` format and 
  use the ``.pfx`` file format. You must upload a certificate of this 
  format to |ldap-provider| to decrypt secure LDAP traffic sent over
  the public internet.

  To generate a ``.pfx`` certificate on MacOS or Linux systems:

  a. Save your public key and SSL certificate to your local machine. 

     .. note::
     
        Your certificate must use the ``PEM`` format.

     If your certificate does not contain your private key, you can save 
     your private key to a ``.key`` format file.

  #. Generate a ``.pfx`` certificate using your private key and your 
     certificate with ``openssl``. The following command generates a 
     ``.pfx`` certificate file named ``<your-cert-name>.pfx``:

     .. code-block:: sh
     
        openssl pkcs12 -export -out <your-cert-name>.pfx \ 
        -inkey <your-key-name>.key -in <your-cert-name>.crt

     When prompted, enter and verify a password to encrypt the file. You 
     will enter this password to decrypt your private key when you 
     upload the ``.pfx`` certificate to |ldap-provider|.

  To generate a ``.pfx`` certificate on a Windows system,
  see the :azure:`Azure documentation 
  </active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-configure-ldaps#export-a-certificate-for-azure-ad-ds>`.

title: "Configure your DNS provider."
level: 4
ref: configure-azure-ldap-dns-provider
content: |

  You must configure your DNS provider so that |service| and the 
  database nodes can connect to the LDAP server in the custom domain 
  that |ldap-provider| manages. 

  Create a host record for LDAP traffic that resolves a subdomain of 
  your ``<managed-domain>`` to the external IP address that the 
  |ldap-provider| LDAP service uses:

  .. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 50 50

    * - LDAP IP Address
      - Subdomain for LDAP Traffic

    * - ``203.0.113.77``
      - ``ldap.aadds.example.com``

  To find the external IP address the |ldap-provider| LDAP service uses,
  see the :azure:`Azure documentation 
  </active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-configure-ldaps#configure-dns-zone-for-external-access>`.

title: "Add your custom domain to Azure AD."
level: 4
ref: configure-azure-ldap-custom-domain
content: | 

  Add your custom domain name to 
  :abbr:`Azure AD (Azure Active Directory)` to create users that belong 
  to your domain. After you add your domain, you must also add the 
  :abbr:`Azure AD (Azure Active Directory)` DNS information in a ``TXT``
  record with your DNS provider and verify the configuration.

  To add your custom domain to 
  :abbr:`Azure AD (Azure Active Directory)`, see the 
  :azure:`Azure documentation 
  </active-directory/fundamentals/add-custom-domain>`.

title: "Configure |ldap-provider| for inbound LDAP traffic."
level: 4
ref: configure-azure-ldap-inbound-traffic
content: |

  You must allow all traffic over all ports from the public internet to 
  port ``636`` to use |ldap-provider| as an LDAP provider with |service|.

  To add an inbound security rule to allow inbound LDAP traffic on port 
  ``636``, see the :azure:`Azure documentation 
  </virtual-network/manage-network-security-group#create-a-security-rule>`.

title: "Create a bind user."
level: 4
ref: configure-azure-ldap-bind-user
content: |

  Create a bind user. The bind user is an 
  :abbr:`Azure AD (Azure Active Directory)` user that you use to query
  the account and to authenticate database users' credentials when they
  connect to an |service| database. The bind user must belong to the 
  custom domain you added to :abbr:`Azure AD (Azure Active Directory)`.

  To create :abbr:`Azure AD (Azure Active Directory)` users, see the 
  :azure:`Azure documentation 
  </active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory/>`.

---
title: "Enable the bind user account for |ldap-provider|."
level: 4
ref: configure-azure-ldap-bind-user-pwhash
content: |

  You must generate a password hash for the bind user for Kerberos
  and NTLM authentication before the bind user can use |ldap-provider|. 
  The steps differ based on the type of 
  :abbr:`Azure AD (Azure Active Directory)` user account.

  To learn how to generate password hashes for your users, see the 
  :azure:`Azure documentation </active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance#enable-user-accounts-for-azure-ad-ds>`.

  To query :abbr:`Azure AD (Azure Active Directory)`, the bind user 
  must belong to the ``AAD DC Administrators`` group.

  To add users to the ``AAD DC Administrators`` group, see the 
  :azure:`Azure documentation 
  </active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance-advanced#configure-an-administrative-group>`.
