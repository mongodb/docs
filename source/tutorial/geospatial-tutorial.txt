Overview
--------

MongoDB's :term:`geospatial` indexing allows you to efficiently execute
spatial queries on a collection that contains geospatial shapes and
points. To showcase the capabilities of geospatial features and compare
different approaches, this tutorial will guide you through the process
of writing queries for a simple geospatial application.

This tutorial will briefly introduce the concepts of geospatial
indexes, and then demonstrate their use with :query:`$geoWithin`,
:query:`$geoIntersects`, and :query:`$nearSphere`.

Suppose you are designing a mobile application to help users find
restaurants in New York City. The application must:

- Determine the user's current neighborhood using :query:`$geoIntersects`,
- Show the number of restaurants in that neighborhood using
  :query:`$geoWithin`, and
- Find restaurants within a specified distance of the user using
  :query:`$nearSphere`.

This tutorial will use a ``2dsphere`` index to query for this data on spherical
geometry.

For more information on spherical and flat geometries, see
:ref:`geospatial-geometry`.

Distortion
----------

Spherical geometry will appear distorted when visualized on a map due to
the nature of projecting a three dimensional sphere, such as the earth,
onto a flat plane.

For example, take the specification of the spherical square defined by
the longitude latitude points ``(0,0)``, ``(80,0)``, ``(80,80)``, and
``(0,80)``. The following figure depicts the area covered by this region:

Searching for Restaurants
-------------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the example datasets from
`<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/geospatial/neighborhoods.json>`_ and
`<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/geospatial/restaurants.json>`_.
These contain the collections ``restaurants`` and ``neighborhoods`` respectively.

After downloading the datasets, import them into the database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   mongoimport <path to restaurants.json> -c=restaurants
   mongoimport <path to neighborhoods.json> -c=neighborhoods

A geospatial index, and almost
always improves performance of :query:`$geoWithin` and :query:`$geoIntersects`
queries.

Because this data is geographical, create a ``2dsphere`` index on each
collection using the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" })
   db.neighborhoods.createIndex({ geometry: "2dsphere" })

Exploring the Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inspect an entry in the newly-created ``restaurants`` collection from within the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.findOne()

This query returns a document like the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      location: {
         type: "Point",
         coordinates: [-73.856077, 40.848447]
      },
      name: "Morris Park Bake Shop"
   }

This restaurant document corresponds to the location shown in the following
figure:

.. include:: /images/geospatial-single-point.rst

Because the tutorial uses a ``2dsphere`` index, the geometry data in the
``location`` field must follow the :doc:`GeoJSON format </reference/geojson>`.

Now inspect an entry in the ``neighborhoods`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.neighborhoods.findOne()

This query will return a document like the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      geometry: {
         type: "Polygon",
         coordinates: [[
            [ -73.99, 40.75 ],
            ...
            [ -73.98, 40.76 ],
            [ -73.99, 40.75 ]
         ]]
       },
       name: "Hell's Kitchen"
   }

This geometry corresponds to the region depicted in the following figure:

.. include:: /images/geospatial-polygon-hells-kitchen.rst

Find the Current Neighborhood
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming the user’s mobile device can give a reasonably accurate location for
the user, it is simple to find the user's current neighborhood with
:query:`$geoIntersects`.

Suppose the user is located at -73.93414657 longitude and 40.82302903 latitude.
To find the current neighborhood, you will specify a point using the special
:query:`$geometry` field in :term:`GeoJSON` format:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.neighborhoods.findOne({ geometry: { $geoIntersects: { $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.93414657, 40.82302903 ] } } } })

This query will return the following result:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "_id" : ObjectId("55cb9c666c522cafdb053a68"),
       "geometry" : {
           "type" : "Polygon",
           "coordinates" : [
               [
                   [
                       -73.93383000695911,
                       40.81949109558767
                   ],
                   ...
               ]
           ]
       },
       "name" : "Central Harlem North-Polo Grounds"
   }

Find all Restaurants in the Neighborhood
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also query to find all restaurants contained in a given neighborhood.
Run the following in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to find the neighborhood
containing the user, and then count the restaurants within that neighborhood:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var neighborhood = db.neighborhoods.findOne( { geometry: { $geoIntersects: { $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.93414657, 40.82302903 ] } } } } )
   db.restaurants.find( { location: { $geoWithin: { $geometry: neighborhood.geometry } } } ).count()

This query will tell you that there are 127 restaurants in the requested
neighborhood, visualized in the following figure:

.. include:: /images/geospatial-all-restaurants.rst

Find Restaurants within a Distance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find restaurants within a specified distance of a point, you can
use either :query:`$geoWithin` with :query:`$centerSphere` to return results
in unsorted order, or :query:`nearSphere` with :query:`$maxDistance` if you need
results sorted by distance.

Unsorted with ``$geoWithin``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find restaurants within a circular region, use :query:`$geoWithin` with
:query:`$centerSphere`. :query:`$centerSphere` is a MongoDB-specific syntax to
denote a circular region by specifying the center and the radius in radians.

:query:`$geoWithin` does not return the documents in any specific order, so it
may show the user the furthest documents first.

The following will find all restaurants within five miles of the user:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.find({ location:
      { $geoWithin:
         { $centerSphere: [ [ -73.93414657, 40.82302903 ], 5 / 3963.2 ] } } })

:query:`$centerSphere`'s second argument accepts the radius in radians, so you
must divide it by the radius of the earth in miles. See
:doc:`/tutorial/calculate-distances-using-spherical-geometry-with-2d-geospatial-indexes`
for more information on converting between distance units.

Sorted with ``$nearSphere``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may also use :query:`$nearSphere` and specify a :query:`$maxDistance` term
in meters. This will return all restaurants within five miles of the user in
sorted order from nearest to farthest:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var METERS_PER_MILE = 1609.34
   db.restaurants.find({ location: { $nearSphere: { $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.93414657, 40.82302903 ] }, $maxDistance: 5 * METERS_PER_MILE } } })
