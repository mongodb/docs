  The code example performs the following tasks:

  - Imports ``mongodb``, MongoDB's Node.js driver.
  - Creates an instance of the ``MongoClient`` class to establish a 
    connection to your |service| cluster.
  - Uses the :pipeline:`$search` pipeline stage to query the collection. The query 
    uses the following :ref:`compound-ref` operator clauses:
    
    .. include:: /includes/extracts/fts-isnull-stages

  - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
    query.
    
  .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts-tutorial/null-check/tutorial.js
    :language: javascript
    :linenos:
    :dedent:
