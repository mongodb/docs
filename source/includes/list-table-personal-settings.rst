     - Select your time zone.

   * - :guilabel:`My Date Format`

     - Select your preferred date format.

   * - :guilabel:`Page Shown When Switching Groups`

     - Select which page of the |mms| console you will see when you select a
       different group. If you select :guilabel:`Current`, |mms| will not
       change pages when you select a different group.

   * - :guilabel:`Display Opcounters On Separate Charts`

     - Select how to present opcounter charts. If this option is enabled,
       |mms| charts each opcounter type separately. Otherwise, each opcounter
       type is overlaid together in a single chart. For more information on opcounters, see
       :manual:`Server Status Output </reference/command/serverStatus>` in the MongoDB manual.

   * - :guilabel:`Display Chart Annotations`

     - Toggles the presence of chart annotations. Chart annotations overlay
       information about significant system events on the charts. For example,
       with chart annotations |mms| will draw a red vertical line over the
       charts.

   * - :guilabel:`Receive Newsletters`

     - Select whether to receive email newsletters about |mms|.
