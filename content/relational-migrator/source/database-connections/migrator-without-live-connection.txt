You can create a project without a live relational database connection 
to visualize and model your data or to evaluate Relational Migrator. However,
Relational Migrator requires a live database connection to migrate data.

Use Cases
---------

If you don't have a live relational database connection, you can 
load a schema from a :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` file or use 
Relational Migrator's pre-defined sample schema.

Load a Schema From a DDL File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can visualize and model your data by loading a schema from a DDL file.
When you are ready to migrate, you can use the data model you created 
by :ref:`exporting your project file <export-project>`.

Use a Sample Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can try Relational Migrator without a relational database by using the 
pre-defined sample schema. The sample schema uses the ``Northwind`` database,
a popular example database for an order management system. If you want to run 
a migration job using the sample schema, you can deploy a Docker image containing 
the sample schema and data.
