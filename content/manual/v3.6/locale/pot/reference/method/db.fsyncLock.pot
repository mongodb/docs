msgid "Forces the :binary:`~bin.mongod` to flush all pending write operations to disk and locks the *entire* :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance to prevent additional writes until the user releases the lock with a corresponding :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` command."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/method/db.fsyncLock.txt:29
msgid "The :method:`db.fsyncLock()` and :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` operations maintain a lock count. :method:`db.fsyncLock()` increments the lock count, and :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` decrements the lock count."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/method/db.fsyncLock.txt:34
msgid "To unlock a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance for writes, the lock count must be zero. That is, for a given number of :method:`db.fsyncLock()` operations, you must issue a corresponding number of :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` operations to unlock the instance for writes."

msgid "Behavior"

#: ../source/includes/extracts/wt-fsync-lock-compatibility.rst:2
msgid ":method:`db.fsyncLock()` ensures that the data files are safe to copy using low-level backup utilities such as ``cp``, ``scp``, or ``tar``. A :binary:`~bin.mongod` started using the copied files contains user-written data that is indistinguishable from the user-written data on the locked :binary:`~bin.mongod`."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/extracts/wt-fsync-lock-compatibility.rst:8
msgid "The data files of a locked :binary:`~bin.mongod` may change due to operations such as :ref:`journaling syncs <journal-process>` or :ref:`WiredTiger snapshots <storage-wiredtiger-checkpoints>`.  While this has no affect on the logical data (e.g. data accessed by clients), some backup utilities may detect these changes and emit warnings or fail with errors. For more information on MongoDB- recommended backup utilities and procedures, see :doc:`/core/backups/`."
