In version 2.2, MongoDB introduced the :doc:`aggregation framework
</core/aggregation>` that provides a powerful and flexible set
of tools to use for many data aggregation tasks. If you're familiar with
data aggregation in SQL, consider the
:doc:`/reference/sql-aggregation-comparison` document as an introduction
to some of the basic concepts in the aggregation framework. Consider the
full documentation of the aggregation framework and other data
aggregation tools for MongoDB here:
