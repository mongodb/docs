Embedded verification is enabled by default. Verification checks for data 
consistency between the source and destination clusters. Verification will 
cause mongosync to fail if any inconsistencies are detected, but it does not 
check for all possible data inconsistencies. Please see the documentation at 
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/reference/verification/embedded 
for more details. Verification requires approximately 0.5 GB of memory per 1 
million documents on the source cluster and will fail if insufficient memory 
is available. Accepting this disclaimer indicates that you understand the 
limitations and memory requirements for this tool. To skip this disclaimer 
prompt, use â€“-acceptDisclaimer.

To disable the embedded verifier, specify 'verification: false' when starting 
mongosync. Please see https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/reference/verification/ 
for alternative verification methods.
