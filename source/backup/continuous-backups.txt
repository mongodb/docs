|service| continuous backups take incremental backups of data in your
cluster, ensuring your backups are typically just a few seconds behind 
the operational system. |service| continuous backups allow you to 
:doc:`restore </restore-cluster>` from stored snapshots or from a 
selected point in time within the last 24 hours. You can also
:doc:`query a continuous backup snapshots </query-backup>`

For sharded clusters, the backup service temporarily stops the balancer
via the :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` in order to insert a marker token
into all shards and config servers in the cluster. |service| takes a
snapshot when the marker tokens appear in the backup data.

Enable Backup
-------------

You can enable continuous backups during the :doc:`cluster creation
</create-new-cluster>` or during the :doc:`modification of an existing
cluster </scale-cluster>`. 

From the the cluster configuration modal, toggle ``Do you want to enable
backup?`` to ``Yes``. For clusters deployed to 
:ref:`Azure <microsoft-azure>`, select the :guilabel:`Continuous` 
card.

.. _continuous-snapshot-storage-location:

Snapshot Storage Location
-------------------------

Each project has *one* backup data center location dictated by the *first*
backup-enabled cluster created in that project. 

For single-region |service| clusters created after June 21st, 2017,
|service| stores backup data for an |service| cluster in a data center
specific to the cluster's geographic region. 

For multi-region |service| clusters, |service| stores backup data for the
cluster in a data center specific to the geographical location of the
cluster's Preferred Region.

.. important::
   
   All additional backup-enabled clusters created in the project use the
   backup data center selected during deployment of the project's first
   backup-enabled cluster regardless of the geographical location of the
   cluster region or regions.
   
   To change the data center location of a cluster, you must disable
   backups for *all* clusters in the project. You can then enable
   backups for a cluster whose geographic region corresponds to the data
   center location of your choice.

|service| retains these snapshots based on the :ref:`retention policy
<retention-policy>`.

.. _modify-backup-schedule:

Modify Backup Schedule
----------------------

If you enable backup for a cluster, |service| takes a base snapshot of
your data every 6 hours.

To change a deployment's backup schedule, go to :guilabel:`Backup`. For
the cluster whose backup schedule you wish to modify, click the
ellipsis and select :guilabel:`Edit Snapshot Schedule` menu option.

.. _retention-policy:

Retention Policy
----------------

|service| retains snapshots for the time periods listed in the
following table. If you disable backup for a cluster or terminate a
cluster, |service| immediately deletes the backup snapshots for the
cluster.
