cursor.batchSize()
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: cursor.batchSize()

   The :method:`batchSize() <cursor.batchSize()>` method specifies the
   number of documents to return in each batch of the response from the
   MongoDB instance. In most cases, modifying the batch size will
   not affect the user or the application since the
   :program:`mongo` shell and most :doc:`drivers
   </applications/drivers>` return results as if MongoDB returned a
   single batch.

   The :method:`batchSize() <cursor.batchSize()>` method takes the
   following parameter:

   :param size:

          The number of documents to return per batch. Do **not** use a
          batch size of ``1``.

   .. note::

      Specifying ``1`` or a negative number is analogous to using the
      :method:`limit() <cursor.limit()>` method.

   Consider the following example of the :method:`batchSize()
   <cursor.batchSize()>` method in the :program:`mongo` shell: 

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.inventory.find().batchSize(10)

   This operation will set the batch size for the results of a query
   (i.e. :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>`) to ``10``. The
   effects of this operation do not effect the output in the
   :program:`mongo` shell, which always iterates over the first 20
   documents.
