      Create the following file at ``/etc/init.d/disable-transparent-hugepages``:

    language: sh

         #!/bin/bash
         ### BEGIN INIT INFO

             if [ -d /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage ]; then
               thp_path=/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage
             elif [ -d /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage ]; then
               thp_path=/sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage
             else
               return 0
             fi

             echo 'never' | tee ${thp_path}/enabled > /dev/null

      .. note::

         MongoDB {+version+} also checks the THP *defrag*
         setting and presents a startup warning if defrag is
         enabled. As long as THP itself is disabled in
         the ``init.d`` script, MongoDB is unaffected by the defrag
         setting. However, to avoid this message, you may set defrag to
         ``never`` by adding the following line to the ``init.d``
         script, just before the ``unset thp_path`` statement:

         .. code-block:: sh

            echo 'never' | tee ${thp_path}/defrag > /dev/null

title: Make it executable.
stepnum: 2
level: 4
ref: make-executable
action:
  - pre: |
      Run the following command to make the script executable:

    language: sh
    code: sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/disable-transparent-hugepages
---
title: Run the script.
stepnum: 3
level: 4
ref: run-script
action:
  - pre: |
      Run the script manually once to ensure that the appropriate THP
      setting has been changed:

    language: sh
    code:
      sudo /etc/init.d/disable-transparent-hugepages start

  - pre: |
      Verify that THP has successfully been set to ``[never]`` by running the
      following command:

    language: sh
    code:

       cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

  - pre: |
      On Red Hat Enterprise Linux and potentially other Red Hat-based
      derivatives, you may instead need to use the following:

    language: sh
    code:

       cat /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled

      To ensure that this setting is applied each time your system
      boots, run the following command for your Linux distribution:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 20 80

         * - Distribution

           - Command

         * - Ubuntu and Debian

           - .. code:: sh

                sudo update-rc.d disable-transparent-hugepages defaults

         * - SUSE

           - .. code:: sh

                sudo insserv /etc/init.d/disable-transparent-hugepages

         * - Red Hat, CentOS, Amazon Linux, and derivatives

           - .. code:: sh

                sudo chkconfig --add disable-transparent-hugepages

      If you are using ``tuned`` or ``ktune`` on
      :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)`/ CentOS,
      you must now also create a custom ``tuned`` profile.
