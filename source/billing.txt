.. _billing-overview:

Billing settings are configured at the organization level and apply to
all projects within that organization. You can examine costs at the
organization level or the project level.

|service|:

- charges by the hour for your MongoDB {+clusters+}
- charges for usage of your MongoDB {+Serverless-instances+}
- tabulates costs daily
- displays your current monthly costs on the
  :ref:`Invoices page <view-current-invoice>`

To view line-item charges,
:ref:`view all of your invoices <view-past-invoices>`.

As you configure a {+database-deployment+}, you can view the total 
cost, except for data transfer, before applying your settings.

Required Access

Your Billing Profile
--------------------

.. _atlas-billing-profile:

View and Edit Your Billing Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view and edit your billing profile:

.. include:: /includes/steps-billing-profile-edit.rst

.. _atlas-billing-methods:

Payment Method
--------------

To pay for your |service| usage, you can:

- Pay with an
  :ref:`accepted payment method <payment-alternatives>`.
- Pay with a MongoDB |service|
  :ref:`subscription <atlas-subscriptions>`.

Contact :website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>` to:

- Purchase a subscription. Your :ref:`subscription level
  <subscription-level>` determines your access to support and other
  entitlements.
- Review alternative billing methods.

.. important::
   
   To confirm your credit card information, |service| charges $1.00 
   when you first connect a credit card to your account. After 
   |service| confirms your information, it refunds the $1.00 charge. If 
   you encounter any issues with connecting a credit card to your 
   account, reach out to your card provider or banking institution. 
   Verify whether they declined the initial charge, which would prevent 
   |service| from confirming your information.

.. _payment-method:
.. _atlas-payment-method:
.. _payment-alternatives:

Set Payment Method

.. _cross-org-billing:

Cross-Organization Billing
--------------------------

*Cross-organization billing* is an |service| subscription feature that 
enables you to share a billing subscription across many 
:doc:`organizations </tutorial/manage-organizations/>` and to pay a 
single invoice for them. After 
:ref:`configuring a paying organization <configure-paying-org>`, you 
pay invoices for the paying organization that include a list of charges 
incurred for all linked organizations.

A paying organization's :guilabel:`Overview` tab includes the
:guilabel:`Running Invoice Total`.

The :guilabel:`Running Invoice Total` shows:

- the paying organization's charges, or
- if you have linked organizations, the paying and linked organizations'
  combined charges.

To display linked organizations and their contributions to the 
:guilabel:`Running Invoice Total`, view the :ref:`payment details <payment-details>`
section of your organization's invoice.

Linked organizations are subject to the subscription agreement of the 
paying organization, including the level of support, the charges 
associated with the subscription, discounts, and payment terms.

Linked Organization Invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You pay for all linked organization usage through the paying 
organization. To help you account for usage, each linked organization
has its own monthly invoice.

Linked organization invoices include:

- All charges incurred by that organization.
- A percentage of your total cross-organization  billing subscription
  cost proportional to that organization's usage.

Each day, |service| bills linked and paying organizations for
subscription uplift based on their own usage.

At the end of a paying organization's billing period, |service| bills
linked and paying organizations proportionally to their usage for the unmet 
monthly minimum, if there is one.

.. example::
   A paying organization has an |service| Pro subscription and two 
   linked organizations. The paying organization incurs no charges. 
   
   Linked organization #1 incurs $400 in subscription uplift charges 
   while linked organization #2 incurs $200 in subscription uplift 
   charges. The paying organization has a monthly minimum of $799, so 
   at the end of the month, the unmet $199 is proportionally distributed 
   across invoices for linked organizations #1 and #2:

   - |service| charges linked organization #1 $132.70 of the unmet $199 
     because it incurred 2/3 of the total charges.

   - |service| charges linked organization #2 $66.30 of the unmet $199 
     because it incurred 1/3 of the total charges.

   You still pay all charges through the paying organization.

.. note::
   
   At the end of the paying organization's billing period, simultaneous 
   charges for daily subscription uplift and an unmet minimum could 
   trigger daily maximum billing alerts.

.. _cross-org-billing-use-cases:

Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~

Use cross-organization billing to:

- Create broad levels of authorization using |service| organizations.
- Exceed the 250-project limit on |service| organizations.

.. example::

   A company with sales and engineering teams requires that
   each team has different organization-level authorization. At the same
   time, the company prefers to receive a single invoice for the
   company's database use. 

   To pay all costs through that paying organization and maintain control
   over the authorizations of each team organization, the company can:

   1. Create two organizations for sales and engineering.
   2. Link these organizations to a paying organization.

   A company with over 250 projects might create new organizations for new
   projects, then link all organizations to a paying organization to 
   maintain a single source of invoicing.

.. _configure-paying-org:

Configure a Paying Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prerequisites and Limitations
`````````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-cross-org-billing-prereqs.rst

To configure a paying organization and link other organizations to it:

.. include:: /includes/steps-configure-paying-organization.rst

The :guilabel:`Linked Organizations` tab displays your linked 
organizations. To link additional organizations, click 
:guilabel:`Link More Organizations`.

.. _unlink-with-cross-org-billing:

Unlink Organizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can unlink organizations from your paying organization.

When you unlink an organization, the change takes effect upon processing
your next invoice. If you change your mind and want to re-link 
an organization before your next invoice, you can cancel 
the unlinking request before that invoice is processed.

You can unlink or cancel unlinking from the |service| Admin UI. You must have
permissions to make changes to your linked organization's billing settings. To 
unlink a linked organization, follow these steps:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-billing.rst
   
   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Linked Organizations` tab.
   
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Unlink` next to the organization you want to unlink.
   
      .. important::
   
         The organization will be unlinked upon generating your next 
         invoice. 
         For the current invoice period, the organization will continue 
         to incur charges on the paying organization. After that, the 
         organization will be unlinked and receive a separate invoice.

   .. step:: Enter and save new payment method. 
          
      You can enter a credit card number or a MongoDB activation code. 

      After the upcoming invoice, |service| bills your new organization 
      separately.

If you want to cancel the unlinking request, navigate to the 
:guilabel:`Linked Organizations` tab. Click 
:guilabel:`Cancel Unlinking` next to the organization you 
want to cancel the unlinking process for. 
If you applied an activation code, you can apply
that code to your paying organization or 
remove it to use elsewhere.

Billing Quota Management
------------------------

You can use :ref:`billing alerts <billing-alerts>` to help manage your
billing quotas. Billing alerts notify a designated person when a bill
has exceeded a |usd| limit, or when a credit card is about to expire.

To :ref:`configure billing alerts <configure-alert-settings-tabs>`:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-settings.rst

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-alerts.rst
