Create a Role
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Roles grant users access to MongoDB resources. By default, MongoDB
provides a number of :doc:`built-in roles </reference/built-in-roles>`
that administrators may use to control access to a MongoDB system.
However, if these roles cannot describe the desired set of privileges,
you can create a new, customized role in a particular database.

Except for roles created in the ``admin`` database, a role can only
include privileges that apply to its database and can only inherit from
other roles in its database.

A role created in the ``admin`` database can include privileges that
apply to the ``admin`` database, other databases or to the
:ref:`cluster <resource-cluster>` resource, and can inherit from roles
in other databases as well as the ``admin`` database.

MongoDB uses the combination of the database name and the role name to
uniquely define a role.

Procedures
----------

To create a new role, use the :method:`db.createRole()` method,
specifying the privileges in the ``privileges`` array and the inherited
roles in the ``roles`` array.

.. _create-role-to-manage-ops:

Create a Role to Manage Current Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example creates a role named ``manageOpRole`` which
provides only the privileges to run both :method:`db.currentOp()` and
:method:`db.killOp()`. [#built-in-roles1]_

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-role-manage-ops.rst

.. [#built-in-roles1] 
   The built-in role :authrole:`clusterMonitor` also provides the
   privilege to run :method:`db.currentOp()` along with other
   privileges, and the built-in role :authrole:`hostManager` provides
   the privilege to run :method:`db.killOp()` along with other
   privileges.

.. _create-role-for-mongostat:

Create a Role to Run ``mongostat``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example creates a role named ``mongostatRole`` that
provides only the privileges to run :program:`mongostat`.
[#built-in-roles2]_

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-role-mongostat.rst

.. [#built-in-roles2] The built-in role
   :authrole:`clusterMonitor` also provides the privilege to run
   :program:`mongostat` along with other
   privileges.
