Prerequisites
-------------

.. _tableau-odbc-required:

MySQL Enterprise Edition ODBC Driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure requires the Enterprise edition of the MySQL ODBC
driver. MySQL Enterprise uses OpenSSL, which is compatible with |bic|
for TLS/SSL connections.

Go to `<https://www.mysql.com/downloads/>`_ and download the MySQL
Enterprise Edition.

If you have installed a community edition of the driver, to install the
Enterprise edition for the same driver version, you must uninstall the
community edition. To uninstall, you can either:

- Remove the driver by using the .msi for community edition.

- Remove the driver from the :guilabel:`Control Panel` >
  :guilabel:`Programs and Features` screen.

Tableau Desktop 10.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure uses Tableau Desktop 10.5.


.. note::

   The default installation of the Tableau Desktop 10.5 includes the
   installation of various drivers, including the community edition of
   the MySQL ODBC driver.

   During installation, you can customize the installation to not
   download the drivers. Or, if you have already installed Tableau with
   default settings, see the :ref:`ODBC prerequisities section
   <tableau-odbc-required>` for installing the Enterprise edition.
