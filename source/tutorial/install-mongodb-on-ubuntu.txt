This tutorial outlines the steps to install :term:`MongoDB` on Ubuntu
Linux systems. The tutorial uses ``.deb`` packages to install. Although
Ubuntu include its own MongoDB packages, the official MongoDB packages
are generally more up to date.

.. note::

   If you use an older Ubuntu that does **not** use Upstart, (i.e. any
   version before 9.10 "Karmic") please follow the instructions on the
   :doc:`install-mongodb-on-debian` tutorial.

Package Options
---------------

The MongoDB downloads repository provides the ``mongodb-10gen`` package,
which contains the latest **stable** release. Additionally you can
:ref:`install previous releases <install-ubuntu-version-pinning>` of MongoDB.

You cannot install this package concurrently with the ``mongodb``,
``mongodb-server``, or ``mongodb-clients`` packages provided by Ubuntu.

Install MongoDB
---------------

Configure Package Management System (APT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Ubuntu package management tool (i.e. ``dpkg`` and ``apt``)
ensure package consistency and authenticity by requiring that
distributors sign packages with GPG keys. Issue the following command
to import the `MongoDB public GPG Key <http://docs.mongodb.org/10gen-gpg-key.asc>`_:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 7F0CEB10

Create a ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb.list`` file using the
following command.

.. code-block:: sh

   echo 'deb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/ubuntu-upstart dist 10gen' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb.list

Now issue the following command to reload your repository:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt-get update

.. _install-ubuntu-version-pinning:

Install Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the following command to install the latest stable version of
MongoDB:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt-get install mongodb-10gen

When this command completes, you have successfully installed MongoDB!
Continue for configuration and start-up suggestions.

Manage Installed Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``mongodb-10gen`` package to install previous versions
of MongoDB. To install a specific release, append the version number
to the package name, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   apt-get install mongodb-10gen=2.2.3

This will install the ``2.2.3`` release of MongoDB. You can specify
any available version of MongoDB; however ``apt-get`` **will** upgrade
the ``mongodb-10gen`` package when a newer version becomes
available. Use the following *pinning* procedure to prevent unintended
upgrades.

To pin a package, issue the following command at the system prompt to
*pin* the version of MongoDB at the currently installed version:

.. code-block:: sh

   echo "mongodb-10gen hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections

Control Scripts

Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process by issuing the following
command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo service mongodb start

You can verify that :binary:`~bin.mongod` has started successfully by checking the
contents of the log file at ``/var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log``.

Stop MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As needed, you may stop the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process by issuing the
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo service mongodb stop

Restart MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process by issuing the
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo service mongodb restart
