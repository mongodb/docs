Core Processes
--------------

The core components in the MongoDB package are: 

.. list-table::

   * - :binary:`~bin.mongod`,
  
     - the core database process
  
   * - :binary:`~bin.mongos`

     - the controller and query router for :term:`sharded clusters
       <sharded cluster>`

   * - :binary:`~bin.mongo` 
     - the interactive MongoDB Shell.

Windows Services
----------------

The :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` and :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` describe the
options available for configuring MongoDB when running as a Windows
Service. The :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` and :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` binaries
provide a superset of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
options.

Binary Import and Export Tools
------------------------------

:binary:`~bin.mongodump` provides a method for creating :term:`BSON`
dump files from the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, while
:binary:`~bin.mongorestore` makes it possible to restore these
dumps. :binary:`~bin.bsondump` converts BSON dump files into
:term:`JSON`.

   /reference/program/mongorestore
   /reference/program/bsondump

Data Import and Export Tools
----------------------------

:binary:`~bin.mongoimport` provides a method for taking data in :term:`JSON`,
:term:`CSV`, or :term:`TSV` and importing it into a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance. :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` provides a method to export data from
a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance into JSON, CSV, or TSV.

.. note::

   The conversion between BSON and other formats lacks full
   type fidelity. Therefore you cannot use :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` and
   :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` for round-trip import and export operations.

Diagnostic Tools
----------------

.. note::

   Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB offers :doc:`free Cloud monitoring
   </administration/free-monitoring>` for standalones and replica sets.
   For more information, see :doc:`/administration/free-monitoring`.

:binary:`~bin.mongostat` and :binary:`~bin.mongotop`
provide diagnostic information related to the current operation of a
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

:binary:`~bin.mongoreplay` is a traffic capture and replay tool for MongoDB
that you can use to inspect and record commands sent to a MongoDB
instance, and then replay those commands back onto another host at a
later time.  :binary:`~bin.mongoreplay` is available for Linux and macOS.

MongoDB 3.4 provides :binary:`~bin.mongoldap` for testing native operating system
LDAP configuration options against a running LDAP server or set of servers.

GridFS
------

:binary:`~bin.mongofiles` provides a command-line interact to a MongoDB
:term:`GridFS` storage system.

MongoDB Compass
---------------

.. versionadded:: 3.6

   MongoDB is packaged with an :binary:`~bin.install_compass` script, which
   is a platform-specific installer for
   :ref:`MongoDB Compass Community Edition <compass-index>`.
