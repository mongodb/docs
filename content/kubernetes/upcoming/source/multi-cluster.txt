   :description: Deploy MongoDB replica sets that span two or more Kubernetes clusters in a single region across more than one zone, or in more than one region and zone.

.. important::

   You can deploy |k8s-op-full| to manage MongoDB deployments that span two
   or more |k8s| clusters. The |k8s-op-short| supports deploying both
   replica sets and sharded clusters across two or more |k8s| clusters. 

:ref:`multi-cluster-overview-ref`
