You can give a chart a title and/or a description at any time when the
chart is open for editing. The title and description appear above the
chart wherever the chart is rendered.

To create a title for a chart:

1. Click :guilabel:`Enter a title` above the chart.
#. Enter your desired title.
#. Click the check mark below the text box to save your title.

To create a description for a chart:

1. Click :guilabel:`Enter a description` above the chart.
#. Enter your desired text. Select one or more words to format the
   highlighted text. Formatting options include:

   - Bold
   - Italic
   - Hyperlink
#. Click the check mark below the text box to save your description.

Descriptions are limited to a single line of text. If the text exceeds
the space available on one line, it is truncated.

Both title and description are blank by default. If you don't create a
title or description for a chart, the chart expands to occupy the space
a title or description would otherwise occupy.
