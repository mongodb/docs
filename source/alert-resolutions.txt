|service| issues alerts for the database and server conditions
configured in your :doc:`alert settings </configure-alerts>`. When a
condition triggers an alert, |service| displays a warning symbol on the
cluster and sends alert notifications. Your alert settings determine
the notification methods. |service| continues sending notifications at
regular intervals until the condition resolves or you delete or disable
the alert. You should fix the immediate problem, implement a long-term 
solution, and :ref:`view metrics <monitor-cluster-metrics>` to monitor 
your progress.

.. note::

   If you integrate with VictorOps, OpsGenie, or DataDog, you can 
   receive informational alerts from these 
   :ref:`third-party monitoring services <third-party-integrations>` in 
   |service|. However, you must resolve these alerts within 
   each external service.

View Alerts

.. tabs:: 
   :hidden: true

   .. tab:: Organization Alerts
      :tabid: org

      You can view all alerts, alert settings, and deleted alerts on 
      the :guilabel:`Organization Alerts` page. To learn more, see 
      :ref:`alerts-workflow`.

      To view all open alerts:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-view-org-alerts.rst

   .. tab:: Project Alerts
      :tabid: project
   
      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
            :tabid: atlascli

            .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-alerts-list-and-describe.rst

         .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
            :tabid: ui

            You can view open alerts, closed alerts, and alert 
            settings on the :guilabel:`Project Alerts` page. 
            |service| sends notifications for all alerts 
            that appear on the :guilabel:`Open` tab. To learn more, see 
            :ref:`alerts-workflow`.
      
            To view all open alerts using the {+atlas-ui+}:

            .. include:: /includes/steps-view-project-alerts.rst

.. _acknowledge-alert:

Acknowledge Alerts
------------------

.. tabs:: 
   :hidden: true

   .. tab:: Organization Alerts
      :tabid: org

      To acknowledge alerts:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-ack-org-alerts.rst

   .. tab:: Project Alerts
      :tabid: project

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
            :tabid: atlascli

            .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-alerts-acknowledge.rst

         .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
            :tabid: ui
      
            To acknowledge alerts using the {+atlas-ui+}:

            .. include:: /includes/steps-ack-project-alerts.rst

When you acknowledge an alert, |service| sends no further notifications 
until either the acknowledgement period ends, you resolve the alert 
condition, or you unacknowledge the alert. If an alert condition ends 
during an acknowledgment period, |service| sends a notification.

.. _unacknowledge-alert:

Unacknowledge Alerts
--------------------

You can unacknowledge an alert that you previously acknowledged. After
you unacknowledge an active alert, |service| resumes sending
notifications at regular intervals until the condition resolves or you
delete, disable, or re-acknowledge the alert.

.. tabs:: 
   :hidden: true

   .. tab:: Organization Alerts
      :tabid: org

      To unacknowledge alerts:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-unack-org-alerts.rst

   .. tab:: Project Alerts
      :tabid: project

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
            :tabid: atlascli

            .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-alerts-unacknowledge.rst

         .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
            :tabid: ui
      
            To unacknowledge alerts using the {+atlas-ui+}:

            .. include:: /includes/steps-unack-project-alerts.rst

Increase Cluster Capacity
-------------------------

To resolve an alert by increasing your cluster's capacity, see
:doc:`/scale-cluster`.

.. _project-activity-feed:

View All Activity
-----------------

To view and filter the activity feed for an organization or project, see
:ref:`view-activity-feed`.

Resolutions for Specific Alerts
-------------------------------

The following sections describe |service|
:doc:`alert conditions </reference/alert-conditions>` and suggest
steps for resolving them.

   * - Alert Type
     - Description

   * - :ref:`Auto-scaling Alerts <atlas-autoscaling-alerts>`
     - Auto-scaling events, such as a change in the {+cluster+} tier. You
       can configure |service| to notify you of these events.

   * - :ref:`Atlas Search Alerts <atlas-search-alerts>`
     - Amount of CPU and memory used by |fts| processes reach a 
       specified threshold.

   * - :ref:`Connection Alerts <connection-alerts>`
     - Number of connections to a MongoDB process
       exceeds the allowable maximum.
    
   * - :ref:`Disk Space % Used Alerts <disk-space-used>`
     - Percentage of used disk space on a partition reaches a
       specified threshold.

   * - :ref:`Query Targeting Alerts <query-targeting-resolution>`
     - Indicates inefficient queries.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-query-targeting-mongot.rst

   * - :ref:`Replica Set Has No Primary <no-primary>`
     - No :term:`primary` is detected in replica set.

   * - :ref:`Replication Oplog Alerts <replication-oplog-alerts>`
     - Amount of :term:`oplog` data generated on a :term:`primary`
       cluster member is larger than the cluster's configured oplog
       size.

   * - :ref:`System CPU Usage Alerts <system-cpu>`
     - CPU usage of the MongoDB process reaches a specified
       threshold.
