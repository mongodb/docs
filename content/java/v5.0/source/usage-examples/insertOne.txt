.. _java-usage-insertone:

=================
Insert a Document
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can insert a single document into a collection using the ``insertOne()``
method on a ``MongoCollection`` object. To insert a document, construct a
``Document`` object that contains the fields and values that you want to
store. If you call the ``insertOne()`` method on a collection that does
not exist yet, the server automatically creates it for you.

Upon a successful insertion, ``insertOne()`` returns an instance of
``InsertOneResult``. You can retrieve information such as the ``_id``
field of the document you inserted by calling the ``getInsertedId()``
method on the ``InsertOneResult`` instance.

If your insert operation fails, the driver raises an exception. For more
information on the types of exceptions raised under specific conditions,
see the API documentation for ``insertOne()``, linked at the bottom of
this page.

Example
-------

The following snippet inserts a single document into the ``movies``
collection.

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/InsertOne.java
   :language: java

When you run the example, you should see output that resembles the following
with the inserted document's ``ObjectId`` in the value field:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Inserted document id: BsonObjectId{value=...}
