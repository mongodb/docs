Connection String URI Format
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This document describes the URI format for defining connections between
applications and MongoDB instances in the official MongoDB :doc:`drivers
</applications/drivers>`.

Standard Connection String Format
---------------------------------

This section describes the standard format of the MongoDB connection URI
used to connect to a MongoDB database server. The format is the same for
all official MongoDB drivers. For a list of drivers and links to driver
documentation, see :doc:`/applications/drivers`.

The following is the standard URI connection scheme:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]

The components of this string are:

#. ``mongodb://``

   A required prefix to identify that this is a string in the standard
   connection format.

#. ``username:password@``

   Optional. If specified, the client will attempt to log in to the
   specific database using these credentials after connecting to the
   :program:`mongod` instance.

#. ``host1``

   This the only required part of the URI. It identifies a server
   address to connect to. It identifies either a hostname, IP address,
   or UNIX domain socket.

#. ``:port1``

   Optional. The default value is ``:27017`` if not specified.

#. ``hostX``

   Optional. You can specify as many hosts as necessary. You would
   specify multiple hosts, for example, for connections to replica
   sets.

#. ``:portX``

   Optional. The default value is ``:27017`` if not specified.

#. ``/database``

   Optional. The name of the database to authenticate if the
   connection string includes authentication credentials in the form
   of ``username:password@``. If ``/database`` is not specified and
   the connection string includes credentials, the driver will
   authenticate to the ``admin`` database.

#. ``?options``

   Connection specific options. See
   :ref:`connections-connection-options` for a full description of
   these options.

   If the connection string does not specify a database/ you must
   specify a slash (i.e.  ``/``) between the last ``hostN`` and the
   question mark that begins the string of options.

.. example:: To describe a connection to a replica set named ``test``,
   with the following :program:`mongod` hosts:

   - ``db1.example.net`` on port ``27017`` and
   - ``db2.example.net`` on port ``2500``.

   You would use a connection string that resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: none

      mongodb://db1.example.net,db2.example.net:2500/?replicaSet=test

.. index:: connections; options
.. _connections-connection-options:

Connection String Options
-------------------------

This section lists all connection options used in the
:ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format`.The options are
not case-sensitive.

Connection options are pairs in the following form:
``name=value``. Separate options with the ampersand (i.e. ``&``)
character. In the following example, a connection uses the
``replicaSet`` and ``connectTimeoutMS`` options:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://db1.example.net,db2.example.net:2500/?replicaSet=test&connectTimeoutMS=300000

.. admonition:: Semi-colon separator for connection string arguments

   To provide backwards compatibility, drivers currently accept
   semi-colons (i.e. ``;``) as option separators.

.. _replica-set-options:
.. _replica-set-option:

Replica Set Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: uri.replicaSet

   Specifies the name of the :term:`replica set`, if the
   :program:`mongod` is a member of a replica set.

   When connecting to a replica set it is important to give a seed
   list of at least two :program:`mongod` instances. If you only
   provide the connection point of a single :program:`mongod`
   instance, and omit the :data:`~uri.replicaSet`, the client will create a
   :term:`standalone` connection.

Connection Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: uri.ssl

   ``true``: Initiate the connection with SSL.

   ``false``: Initiate the connection without SSL.

   .. todo Determine whether ``prefer`` option exists. Check with server
      team whether it's possible to do rolling restarts of a cluster to
      turn on SSL. Here is the option
      ``prefer``: Initiate the connection with SSL, but if that fails initiate without SSL.

   The default value is ``false``.

   .. note:: The :data:`~uri.ssl` option is not supported by all
      drivers. See your :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>`
      documentation and the :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`
      document.

.. data:: uri.connectTimeoutMS

   The time in milliseconds to attempt a connection before timing out.
   The default is never to timeout, though different drivers might
   vary.  See the :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>` documentation.

.. data:: uri.socketTimeoutMS

   The time in milliseconds to attempt a send or receive on a socket
   before the attempt times out. The default is never to timeout,
   though different drivers might vary. See the :doc:`driver
   </applications/drivers>` documentation.

Connection Pool Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most drivers implement some kind of connection pooling handle this for
you behind the scenes. Some drivers do not support connection
pools. See your :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>` documentation
for more information on the connection pooling implementation. These
options allow applications to configure the connection pool when
connecting to the MongoDB deployment.

.. data:: uri.maxPoolSize

   The maximum number of connections in the connection pool. The default
   value is ``100``.

.. data:: uri.minPoolSize

   The minimum number of connections in the connection pool. The default
   value is ``0``.

   .. note:: The :data:`~uri.minPoolSize` option is not supported by all
      drivers. For information on your driver, see the :doc:`drivers
      </applications/drivers>` documentation.

.. data:: uri.maxIdleTimeMS

   The maximum number of milliseconds that a connection can remain
   idle in the pool before being removed and closed.

   This option is not supported by all drivers.

.. data:: uri.waitQueueMultiple

   A number that the driver multiples the :data:`~uri.maxPoolSize` value
   to, to provide the maximum number of threads allowed to wait for a
   connection to become available from the pool. For default values,
   see the :doc:`/applications/drivers` documentation.

.. data:: uri.waitQueueTimeoutMS

   The maximum time in milliseconds that a thread can wait for a
   connection to become available. For default values, see the
   :doc:`/applications/drivers` documentation.

.. _connections-write-concern:

Write Concern Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Write concern <write-concern>` describes the kind of assurances
that the program:`mongod` and the driver provide to the application
regarding the success and durability of the write operation. For a
full explanation of write concern and write operations in general see
the: :doc:`/core/write-operations`:

.. data:: uri.w

   Defines the level and kind of write concern, that the driver uses
   when calling :dbcommand:`getLastError`. This option can take either
   a number or a string as a value.

   .. include:: /reference/connection-string-w-param.rst

.. data:: uri.wtimeoutMS

   The time in milliseconds to wait for replication to succeed, as
   specified in the :data:`~uri.w` option, before timing out. When ``wtimeoutMS`` is ``0``,
   write operations will never time out.

.. data:: uri.journal

   Controls whether write operations will wait until the
   :program:`mongod` acknowledges the write operations and commits the
   data to the on disk :term:`journal`.

   .. include:: /reference/connection-string-journal-param.rst

   If you set :data:`~uri.journal` to ``true``, and specify a :data:`~uri.w`
   value less than 1, :data:`~uri.journal` prevails.

   If you set :data:`~uri.journal` to true, and the :program:`mongod` does
   not have journaling enabled, as with :setting:`nojournal`, then
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` will provide basic receipt
   acknowledgment (i.e. ``w:1``), and will include a ``jnote`` field
   in its return document.

Read Preference Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Read preferences </core/read-preference>` describe the
behavior of read operations with regards to :term:`replica sets
<replica set>`. These parameters allow you to specify read preferences
on a per-connection basis in the connection string:

.. data:: uri.readPreference

   Specifies the :term:`replica set` read preference for this
   connection. This setting overrides any ``slaveOk`` value. The read
   preference values are the following:

   - :readmode:`primary`
   - :readmode:`primaryPreferred`
   - :readmode:`secondary`
   - :readmode:`secondaryPreferred`
   - :readmode:`nearest`

   For descriptions of each value, see
   :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-modes`.

   The default value is :readmode:`primary`, which sends all read
   operations to the replica set's :term:`primary`.

.. data:: uri.readPreferenceTags

   Specifies a tag set as a comma-separated list of
   colon-separated key-value pairs. For example:

   .. code-block:: none

      dc:ny,rack:1

   To specify a *list* of tag sets, use multiple ``readPreferenceTags``.
   The following specifies two tag sets and an empty tag set:

   .. code-block:: none

      readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:1&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny&readPreferenceTags=

   Order matters when using multiple ``readPreferenceTags``.

Authentication Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: uri.authSource

   .. versionadded:: 2.4

   Specify the database name associated with the user's
   credentials, if the users collection do not exist in the database
   where the client is connecting. :data:`~uri.authSource` defaults to
   the database specified in the connection string.

   For authentication mechanisms that delegate credential storage to
   other services, the :data:`~uri.authSource` value should be
   ``$external`` as with the ``PLAIN`` (LDAP) and ``GSSAPI``
   (Kerberos) authentication mechanisms.

   MongoDB will ignore :data:`~uri.authSource` values if the
   connection string specifies no  user name.

.. data:: uri.authMechanism

   .. versionadded:: 2.4

   .. versionchanged:: 2.6
      Support for the ``PLAIN`` and ``GSSAPI`` authentication mechanisms.

   Specify the authentication mechanism that MongoDB will use to
   authenticate the connection. Possible values include:

   .. these options should link to a reference page for authentication
      mechanisms. DOCS-2940

   - MONGODB-CR
   - MONGODB-X509
   - GSSAPI
   - PLAIN

   Only MongoDB Enterprise :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
   instances provide ``GSSAPI`` (Kerberos) and ``PLAIN`` (LDAP)
   mechanisms. To use ``MONGODB-X509``, you must have SSL Enabled.

   See :doc:`/core/authentication` for more information about the
   authentication system in MongoDB. Also consider
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509` for more information on x509
   authentication.

.. data:: uri.gssapiServiceName

   Set the Kerberos service name when connecting to Kerberized MongoDB
   instances. This value must match the service name set on MongoDB
   instances.

   :data:`~uri.gssapiServiceName` defaults to ``mongodb`` for all
   clients and for MongoDB instance. If you change
   :parameter:`saslServiceName` setting on a MongoDB instance, you
   will need to set :data:`~uri.gssapiServiceName` to the same value.

Miscellaneous Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: uri.uuidRepresentation

   .. include:: /reference/connection-string-uuidRepresentation-param.rst

   For the default, see the :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>`
   documentation for your driver.

   .. note:: Not all drivers support the :data:`~uri.uuidRepresentation`
      option. For information on your driver, see the :doc:`drivers
      </applications/drivers>` documentation.
