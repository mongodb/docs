Create an Application
=====================

.. meta::
   :keywords: app, odm, code example

In your ``quickstart`` project, you can create an application
that interacts with the Atlas sample database called ``sample_mflix``.
This database contains a ``movies`` collection, which stores
information about movies. The database also contains a ``users``
collection, which stores information about movie viewers who use 
a streaming service.

To learn more about the ``sample_mflix`` database, see :atlas:`Sample Mflix Dataset
</sample-data/sample-mflix/>` in the Atlas documentation.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create a "sample_mflix" app

      From your project's root directory, run the following command to create a 
      new Django app called ``sample_mflix`` based on a custom template:
      
      .. code-block:: bash

         python manage.py startapp sample_mflix --template https://github.com/mongodb-labs/django-mongodb-app/archive/refs/heads/{+django-version+}.x.zip

      .. note:: App Template

         The ``django-mongodb-app`` template ensures that your ``app.py`` file
         includes the line ``"default_auto_field = 'django_mongodb_backend.fields.ObjectIdAutoField'"``.

   .. step:: Create models for movie, award, and viewer data

      Open the ``models.py`` file in the ``sample_mflix`` directory and replace 
      its contents with the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/models.py
         :language: python
         :copyable:

      The ``Movie`` model represents the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
      and stores information about movies. This model contains an embedded 
      model field named ``awards``, which stores an ``Award`` object. The
      model also contains an array field named ``genres``, which stores
      a list of genres that describe the movie.

      The ``Award`` model does not represent a separate collection. Instead, it 
      represents the embedded document values stored in the ``Movie`` model.
      
      The ``Viewer`` model represents the ``sample_mflix.users`` collection
      and stores account information for movie viewers.

   .. step:: Create views to display data

      Open the ``views.py`` file in your ``sample_mflix`` directory and replace
      its contents with the following code:
      
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/views.py
         :language: python
         :copyable:

      These views display a landing page message and information about your ``Movie``
      and ``Viewer`` models.
   
   .. step:: Configure URLs for your views

      Create a new file called ``urls.py`` file in your ``sample_mflix`` directory.
      To map the views defined in the preceding step to URLs, paste the following
      code into ``urls.py``:
      
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/urls.py
         :language: python
         :copyable:

      Then, navigate to the ``quickstart/urls.py`` file and replace its contents with
      the following code:

      .. code-block:: python

         from django.contrib import admin
         from django.urls import include, path

         urlpatterns = [
             path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
             path("", include("sample_mflix.urls")),
         ]

   .. step:: Create templates to format your data

      In your ``sample_mflix`` directory, create a subdirectory called
      ``templates``. Then, create a file called ``recent_movies.html``
      and paste the following code:
      
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/recent_movies.html
         :language: html
         :copyable:
      
      This template formats the movie data requested by the ``recent_movies`` view.

      Create another file in the ``sample_mflix/templates`` directory called
      ``viewers_list.html`` and paste the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/viewers_list.html
         :language: html
         :copyable:

      This template formats the user data requested by the ``viewers_list`` view.

   .. step:: Include your app in your project

      Open the ``settings.py`` file in ``quickstart`` and edit your 
      ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting to resemble the following code:
      
      .. code-block:: python
         :emphasize-lines: 2

         INSTALLED_APPS = [
             'sample_mflix.apps.SampleMflixConfig',
             'quickstart.apps.MongoAdminConfig',
             'quickstart.apps.MongoAuthConfig',
             'quickstart.apps.MongoContentTypesConfig',
             'django.contrib.sessions',
             'django.contrib.messages',
             'django.contrib.staticfiles',
         ]

   .. step:: Create migrations for your new models

      From your project root, run the following command to create
      migrations for the ``Movie``, ``Award``, and ``Viewer`` models and apply
      the changes to the database:
      
      .. code-block:: bash

         python manage.py makemigrations sample_mflix
         python manage.py migrate

After completing these steps, you have a basic {+django-odm+} app that
you can use to access the ``sample_mflix`` Atlas database.
