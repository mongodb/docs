{+mcli+} Configuration File
================================

The {+mcli+} configuration file stores your profiles. You can update the settings stored in your configuration file by editing the file with a text editor or by using the :ref:`mcli-config-set-command` command.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/secure-config-file.rst

Configuration File Location
---------------------------

The first time you run the :ref:`mcli-config-command` command, the
{+mcli+} creates a configuration file called ``mongocli.toml``. The
{+mcli+} grants the user who ran the command read and write access to
the file. The {+mcli+} saves the configuration file to the folder where
your system stores application configuration files, which is defined by
the ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` environment variable. By default, this location
is the ``/.config`` folder of your home directory. If this folder
doesn't exist, the {+mcli+} creates the folder and grants you read,
write, and execute permissions.

.. _mcli-profiles:

Profiles
--------

The {+mcli+} configuration file stores related settings and
|api| keys in groups called *profiles*. You can create or define multiple profiles so that you can use the {+mcli+} to access different MongoDB services or projects from the same terminal.

The {+mcli+} uses the ``default`` profile by default. To run {+mcli+}
commands without the ``--profile`` flag, you must use a profile named
``default``. To use a profile with any other name, you must specify the
``--profile`` flag for every command.

Example
-------

The following example configuration file contains two profiles,
``default`` and ``myOpsManager``. 

The ``default`` profile connects to a |service| deployment and contains the following settings:

- An organization ID
- |api| keys
- A project ID

The ``myOpsManager`` profile connects to an |onprem| deployment and
contains contains the following settings:

- The |onprem| base |url|
- An organization ID
- |api| keys
- A project ID
