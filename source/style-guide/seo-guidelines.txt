Search Engine Optimization (SEO) considers the actual terms that users 
enter into search engines (keywords) and employs best practices to 
improve traffic to web pages from search engines.  Close attention to page metadata and keywords in the page content can improve page placement in search results.  The following 
guidance helps you to optimize your documentation pages for search.

.. important::

   In addition to this guidance, our content taxonomy improves 
   findability and increases relevance for search queries. To learn 
   more about the instructions and best practices for our content 
   taxonomy, see the `Taxonomy tagging instructions 
   <https://wiki.corp.mongodb.com/display/DE/Taxonomy+tagging+instructions>`__. 

Keywords
--------

You can add the actual terms that users enter into search engines 
(keywords) to the body of your page to improve its SEO.  Google Search Console provides details about the keywords our users enter and you can request this information from the IA and SEO teams.  

.. important::
  
   This guidance makes a distinction between the terms "keywords" and 
   "keyword meta tags". Here "keywords" are popular search terms added 
   throughout the content body, and "keyword meta tags" are metadata 
   specified with the ``.. meta::`` directive. While "keyword meta 
   tags" are available, some search engines might ignore these tags. To 
   learn more about "keyword meta tags", see :ref:`metadata`. We 
   primaily use "keyword meta tags" to supplement our taxonomy. To 
   learn more about the instructions and best practices for "keyword 
   meta tags", see the `Taxonomy tagging instructions 
   <https://wiki.corp.mongodb.com/display/DE/Taxonomy+tagging+instructions>`__.

Add keywords throughout the page copy according to the following best 
practices:

- Take the most concise form of the information that the page conveys 
  and make that the target keyword.

- Avoid keywords so broad that they compete with the product page.

- Avoid keywords so specific that we miss the actual behavior of 
  our searchers.

.. example::

   If the terms that people search for to try to find a page are 
   "MongoDB Atlas Course", add that phrase in at least one spot. For 
   example, use "This MongoDB Atlas course..." instead of "This Getting 
   Started with Atlas course...".

.. _seo-guidelines-titles:

Titles
------

Search engines weight page titles heavily. Name pages appropriately to ensure users can find 
relevant content in the MongoDB Documentation when they use a search engine.  

Consider the following SEO principles when you name a page:

- Title Length

- Standardization

- Findability

- Disambiguation

The following subsections describe these principles. 

Title Length
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Titles should include 30-60 characters. Search engines often truncate pages 
with titles longer than 60 characters. Titles with fewer than 30 characters 
convey limited information to search engines, so search engines recommend these 
pages less often. Search engines might also create a longer page title for pages with
titles under 30 characters.

As described in the :ref:`Page Title Structure <titles-page-title-structure>` subsection, 
the product name, version number, and "MongoDB Docs" are automatically appended to a title 
when the title is passed to a search engine. For example, for a v8.0 Server 
Manual page titled "Install MongoDB", the title is 15 characters long. The full 
title when passed to a search engine ("Install MongoDB - Database Manual v8.0 - MongoDB Docs") 
is 53 characters long. The appended additions to the title can add about 18-35 
characters to the title, depending on the length of the product name. 

Standardization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For pages across MongoDB documentation that cover similar concepts, use consistent
wording in the page titles to ensure a consistent user experience.

For example, multiple pages in the documentation cover the Read CRUD operation. 
You can refer to the Read CRUD operation as a read, find, or query operation.
Titles for pages that document the Read operation should use consistent terminology
to refer to Read operations, based on the most findable term.

Findability
~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the most relevant keywords in a page title. Pay attention to word order in a 
page title. Include the most relevant words at the beginning of the title.

When in doubt, search your potential page title in a search engine. The top five search 
results should resemble the content on your page. 

Disambiguation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For pages that cover commands with the same name but different
functions, add the command categories to the page titles to differentiate the pages.

For example, ``count`` is a database command, aggregation stage, aggregation 
operator, and  ``mongosh`` method. For Server Manual pages, you
can include the command category in the title, like
"count (Database Command)," to differentiate between these pages.

.. _titles-page-title-structure:

Page Title Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The product name, version number, and "MongoDB Docs" are automatically appended to 
Documentation page titles when the title is passed to a search engine.

For example, a v8.0 Server Manual page titled "Install MongoDB" appears as
"Install MongoDB - Database Manual v8.0 - MongoDB Docs" in search engine results.

General Guidelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following SEO best practices for page and subsection titles:

- Use a maximum of 70 characters.

- Include target keywords (the most concise form of the information 
  that the page conveys).

- Avoid excessive or irrelevant words (keyword stuffing).

- Use unique page titles. Identical titles, even between 
  documentation sets, compete in search results.

- Don't include "MongoDB" in a title unless the page is a product 
  landing page.
  
To learn more, see :ref:`titles-and-headings`.

Alternative Text
----------------

Screen readers read alternative text for images aloud so that users can 
better understand an image. Specify alternative text according to the 
following SEO best practices:

- Use a maximum of 125 characters per image.

- Describe the image with sufficient detail to understand what it shows.

- If they apply to the image, include keywords 
  (the actual terms that users enter into search engines). 

To learn more, see :ref:`write-for-accessibility`.

Descriptions
------------

The description is a snippet that appears under the link in the search 
results and is essential for SEO. Write these descriptions according to 
the following best practices:

- Use a concise description of the page content that is enticing, if 
  possible.

- Emphasize the "why" for using the page.

- Use a maximum of 155 characters.

- Include target keywords and a call to action (CTA) that prompts the 
  user to complete their desired task.

  .. example::

     The following examples use a CTA in the description meta tag:

     .. code-block:: rst
	     
	      .. meta::
	         :description: Use a language analyzer to create search keywords in your Atlas Search index that are optimized for a particular natural language.

     .. code-block:: rst
	     
	      .. meta::
	         :description: Use the character filters in an Atlas Search custom analyzer to examine text one character at a time and perform filtering operations.

- Use unique descriptions for every page.
