Add an Arbiter to a Self-Managed Replica Set

In some circumstances (such as if you have a primary and a secondary but
cost constraints prohibit adding another secondary), you may choose to
add a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance to a replica set as an
:doc:`arbiter </core/replica-set-arbiter>` to vote in elections.

Arbiters are ``mongod`` instances that are part of a
:term:`replica set` but do not hold data (i.e. do not provide data
redundancy). They can, however, participate in :ref:`elections
<replica-set-elections>`.

Arbiters have minimal resource requirements and do not require
dedicated hardware. You can deploy an arbiter on an application
server or a monitoring host.

.. important::

   Do not run an arbiter on systems that also host the
   primary or the secondary members of the replica set.

Arbiter
~~~~~~~

An arbiter does not store data, but until the arbiter's :binary:`~bin.mongod`
process is added to the replica set, the arbiter will act like any other
:binary:`~bin.mongod` process and start up with a set of data files and with a
full-sized :term:`journal`.

Add an Arbiter
--------------

.. include:: /includes/admonition-multiple-arbiters.rst

.. include:: /includes/important-hostnames.rst

#. Create a data directory (e.g. :setting:`storage.dbPath`) for the
   arbiter. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance uses the directory for
   configuration data. The directory *will not* hold the data set. For
   example, create the ``/var/lib/mongodb/arb`` directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir /var/lib/mongodb/arb

#. Start the arbiter, specifying the data directory and the name of the replica set
   to join. The following starts an arbiter using the ``/var/lib/mongodb/arb``
   as the :setting:`~storage.dbPath` and  ``rs`` for the replica set name:

   .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

   .. code-block:: bash

      mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /var/lib/mongodb/arb --replSet rs --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

#. Connect to the primary and add the arbiter to the replica set. Use
   the :method:`rs.addArb()` method, as in the following example which
   assumes that ``m1.example.net`` is the hostname associated with the
   specified ip address for the arbiter:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.addArb("m1.example.net:27017")

   This operation adds the arbiter running on port ``27017`` on the
   ``m1.example.net`` host.
