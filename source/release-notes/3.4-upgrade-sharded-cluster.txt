``mongos`` and Earlier Versions of ``mongod`` Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version |newversion| :program:`mongos` instances cannot connect to
earlier versions of :program:`mongod` instances.

The 3.2 and earlier :program:`mongo` shell is not compatible with 3.4
clusters.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Version |oldversion| or Greater
    To upgrade a sharded cluster to |newversion|, **all** members of the
    cluster must be at least version |oldversion|. The upgrade process checks
    all components of the cluster and will produce warnings if any
    component is running version earlier than |oldversion|.

- Config Server as Replica Set (CSRS)
    Starting in |newversion|, the use of the deprecated mirrored
    :program:`mongod` instances as config servers (SCCC) is no longer
    supported. Before you can upgrade your sharded clusters to 3.4, you
    must convert your config servers from SCCC to a replica set (CSRS).

    To convert your config servers from SCCC to CSRS, see
    :doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set`.

- Stop Metadata Changes during the Upgrade
    During the upgrade, ensure that clients do not make changes to the
    collection metadata. For example, during the upgrade, do **not**
    perform any of the following operations:

    - :method:`sh.enableSharding()`

    - :method:`sh.shardCollection()`

    - :method:`sh.addShard()`

    - :method:`db.createCollection()`

    - :method:`db.collection.drop()`

    - :method:`db.dropDatabase()`

    - any operation that creates a database

    - any other operation that modifies the cluster metadata in any way.

    See the :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list of sharding
    commands. Not all commands on the :doc:`/reference/sharding` page
    modify the cluster metadata.

- :ref:`Disable the balancer <sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily>`

- Back up the ``config`` Database
    *Optional but Recommended.* As a precaution, take a backup of the
    ``config`` database *before* upgrading the sharded cluster.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Use Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Download |newversion| Binaries Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs>`_.

See :doc:`/installation` for more information.
