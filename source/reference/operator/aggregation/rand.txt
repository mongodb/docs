Definition
----------

.. expression:: $rand

   .. versionadded:: 4.4.2

   Returns a random float between 0 and 1 each time it is called. 

   :expression:`$rand` has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript
  
      { $rand: {} }

   The :expression:`$rand` operator doesn't take any arguments. 

Behavior
--------
Each time ``$rand`` is called it will return a floating point value 
that has up to 17 digits after the decimal point. Trailing 0s are 
dropped so the actual number of digits may vary.

Examples
--------

Generate Random Data Points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example models charitable donations. The collection starts with a
list of donors.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.donors.insertMany(
      [
        { donorId: 1000, amount: 0, frequency: 1 },
        { donorId: 1001, amount: 0, frequency: 2 },
        { donorId: 1002, amount: 0, frequency: 1 },
        { donorId: 1003, amount: 0, frequency: 2 },
        { donorId: 1004, amount: 0, frequency: 1 }
      ]
   )

We use an aggregation pipeline to update each document with a random
donation amount.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.donors.aggregate(
      [
         { $set: { amount: { $multiply: [ { $rand: {} }, 100 ] } } },
         { $set: { amount: { $floor: "$amount" } } },
         { $merge: "donors" }
      ]
   )

The first :pipeline:`$set` stage updates the ``amount`` field. An
initial value between 0 and 1 is generated using ``$rand``. Then
:expression:`$multiply` scales it upward 100 times.

The :expression:`$floor` operator in the second ``$set`` stage removes
the decimal portion from the ``amount`` to leave an integer value.

Finally, :pipeline:`$merge` writes the random value created in the
previous steps to the ``amount`` field, updating it for each document
in the ``donors`` collection.

You can view the results with a projection stage:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.donors.aggregate(
      [
         { $project: {_id: 0, donorId: 1, amount: 1 } }
      ]
   )

The projection shows the scaled amounts are now random values in the
range from 0 to 99.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "donorId" : 1000, "amount" : 27 }
   { "donorId" : 1001, "amount" : 10 }
   { "donorId" : 1002, "amount" : 88 }
   { "donorId" : 1003, "amount" : 73 }
   { "donorId" : 1004, "amount" : 5 }

Select Random Items From a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use ``$rand`` in an aggregation pipeline to select random
documents from a collection. Consider a collection of voter records:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.voters.insertMany(
      [
        { name: "Archibald", voterId: 4321, district: 3, registered: true },
        { name: "Beckham", voterId: 4331, district: 3, registered: true },
        { name: "Carolin", voterId: 5321, district: 4, registered: true },
        { name: "Debarge", voterId: 4343, district: 3, registered: false },
        { name: "Eckhard", voterId: 4161, district: 3, registered: false },
        { name: "Faberge", voterId: 4300, district: 1, registered: true },
        { name: "Grimwald", voterId: 4111, district: 3, registered: true },
        { name: "Humphrey", voterId: 2021, district: 3, registered: true },
        { name: "Idelfon", voterId: 1021, district: 4, registered: true },
        { name: "Justo", voterId: 9891, district: 3, registered: false }
      ]
   )

Imagine you want to select about half of the voters in District 3 to do
some polling.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.voters.aggregate(
      [
         { $match: { district: 3 } },
         { $match: { $expr: { $lt: [0.5, {$rand: {} } ] } } },
         { $project: { _id: 0, name: 1, registered: 1 } }
      ]
   )

The first pipeline stage matches all documents where the voter is from
district 3.

The second :pipeline:`$match` stage uses ``$rand`` in a match
expression to further refine the selection. For each document,
``$rand`` generates a value between 0 and 1. The threshhold of ``0.5``
in the less than :expression:`($lt)<$lt>` comparison means that
:query:`$expr` will be true for about half the documents.

In the :pipeline:`$project` stage the selected documents are filtered
to return the ``name`` and ``registered`` fields. There are 7 voters in
District 3, running the code selects about half of them.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "name" : "Archibald", "registered" : true }
   { "name" : "Debarge", "registered" : false }
   { "name" : "Humphrey", "registered" : true }

.. note::

   The number of documents selected is different each time. If you need
   to select an exact number of documents, consider using
   :pipeline:`$sample` instead of ``$rand``.

   :query:`$rand (query) <$rand>`, :pipeline:`$sample`, :expression:`$round`
