Time series data is a sequence of data points in which insights are
gained by analyzing changes over time.

Time series data is generally composed of these components:

- **Time**: Indicates when the data point was recorded.

- **Metadata**: A label or tag that identifies a data series and rarely changes. 
  Metadata is stored in a ``metaField``. You cannot add a ``metaField`` field
  to a time series document after you create it. Metadata is also known as ``source``. 
  For more information, see :ref:`timeseries-collections-metafield`. 

- **Metrics**: Individual data points tracked at increments in time, often displayed 
  as key-value pairs that change over time. Metrics are also known as values.

- **Measurements**: Documents that contain data for all metrics at a 
  specific point in time. A measurement includes the time, metadata, 
  and all metrics recorded at that moment.

This table shows examples of time series data:

   * - **Example**
     - **Metrics**
     - **Metadata**

   * - Stock data
     - Stock price
     - Stock ticker, exchange

   * - Weather data
     - Temperature
     - Sensor identifier, location
     
   * - Website visitors
     - View count
     - URL

For efficient time series data storage, MongoDB provides time series
collections.

The following example shows a measurement document for weather data:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "timestamp": ISODate("2025-08-19T12:00:00Z"),
     "metaField": {
       "sensorId": "A1234",
       "location": {
         "city": "New York",
         "state": "NY"
       }
     },
     "temperature": 25.4,
     "humidity": 48.2,
     "pressure": 1012.5,
     "windSpeed": 5.2,
     "windDirection": "NW"
   }

In this example, the measurement contains:

- A timestamp showing when the data was recorded.
- Metadata identifying the sensor and its location.
- Multiple metrics, including temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and 
  direction, collected at the given time.

Time Series Collections
-----------------------

.. versionadded:: 5.0

Time series collections efficiently store time series data. In time
series collections, writes are organized so that data from the same
source is stored alongside other data points from a similar point in
time.

Benefits
~~~~~~~~

Compared to normal collections, storing time series data in time series
collections improves query efficiency and reduces the disk usage for
time series data and :term:`secondary indexes <secondary index>`.
MongoDB 6.3 and later automatically creates a :ref:`compound index
<index-type-compound>` on the time and metadata
fields for new time series collections. 

Time series collections use an underlying columnar storage format and
store data in time-order. This format provides the following benefits:

- Reduced complexity for working with time series data
- Improved query efficiency
- Reduced disk usage
- Reduced I/O for read operations
- Increased WiredTiger cache usage

.. _timeseries-collections-behavior:

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

Time series collections generally behave like other MongoDB collections.
You insert and query data as usual. 

.. warning::

   Match expressions in update and delete commands can only specify the
   metaField. You can't update other fields in a time series document.
   For more details, see :ref:`Time Series Delete and Update Limitations
   <timeseries-limitations-updates-deletes>`. 
   

MongoDB treats time series collections as writable non-materialized
:ref:`views <views-landing-page>` backed by an internal collection. When
you insert data, the internal collection automatically organizes time
series data into an optimized storage format. 

Starting in MongoDB 6.3: if you create a new time series collection,
MongoDB also generates a :ref:`compound index <index-create-compound>`
on the :ref:`metaField and timeField <time-series-fields>` fields. To
improve query performance, queries on time series collections use the
new compound index. The compound index also uses the optimized storage
format.

.. tip::

   To improve query performance, you can manually :ref:`add secondary
   indexes <timeseries-add-secondary-index>` on measurement fields or
   any field in your time series collection.

.. _timeseries-collections-metafield:

metaFields
~~~~~~~~~~

Time series documents can contain an optional metaField to group sets of
documents, both for internal storage optimization and query efficiency.
A metaField should rarely change and can be any data type. A metaField
can be an object and can contain subfields. Once you define a field as
the metaField, you can change the value of the metaField but you cannot
redefine the metaField as another field. For example, if you create time
series documents with the metaField defined as field ``A``, you cannot
later convert a field ``B`` to be the metaField. However, if the value
of metaField ``A`` is an object, you can add new subfields to field
``A``. 

.. note::

   Using an array as a metaField may cause unexpected collection
   behavior because array equality depends on specific order.

Buckets
```````

MongoDB uses the metaField to partition data for efficient organization
and retrieval. When you create a time series collection, MongoDB groups
documents into buckets. Documents within a bucket share an identical
metaField value and have timeField values that are close together.

The number of buckets in a time series collection depends on the number
of unique metaField values. Collections with fine-grained or dynamic
metaField values may generate more, sparsely packed, short-lived buckets
than collections with simple metaFields that rarely or never change.
Fine-grained and dynamic metaField values typically decrease storage and
query effiency. 

Indexes
```````

MongoDB automatically creates a :ref:`compound index
<index-type-compound>` on both the metaField and timeField of a time
series collection. 

metaField Best Practices
````````````````````````

- Select fields that rarely or never change as part of your metaField.
- If possible, select identifiers or other stable values that are common in filter
  expressions as part of your metaField. 
- Avoid selecting fields that are not used for filtering as part of your
  metaField. Instead, use those fields as measurements.
