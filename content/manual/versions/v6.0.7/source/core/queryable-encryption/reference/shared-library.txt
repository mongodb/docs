Overview
--------

The {+shared-library+} is a **dynamic library** that enables your client
application to perform automatic {+qe+}.
A dynamic library is a set of functionality accessed
by an application at runtime rather than compile time.
The {+shared-library+} performs the following tasks:

- Uses your {+enc-fields-map+} to mark fields in
  read and write operations for encryption
- Prevents your application from executing unsupported operations on encrypted
  fields

The {+shared-library+} does not perform any of the following tasks:

- The {+shared-library+} *does not* perform encryption or decryption itself
- The {+shared-library+} *does not* access any encryption key material
- The {+shared-library+} *does not* listen over the network

.. important:: Supported MongoDB Server Products

   Automatic {+qe+} is only available in the following MongoDB server products:
   
   - MongoDB Atlas 6.0 or later clusters
   - MongoDB Enterprise 6.0 or later
   
   Automatic {+qe+} is not available in any version of MongoDB
   Community Server.

The {+shared-library+} provides the same functionality as ``mongocryptd``,
but does not require you to spawn another process to perform automatic
encryption.

To learn more about automatic encryption, see
:ref:`<qe-features>`.

To learn more about ``mongocryptd``, see
:ref:`<qe-reference-mongocryptd>`.

.. note:: libmongocrypt Performs Encryption

   Drivers compatible with MongoDB 6.0 and later use the
   Apache-licensed `libmongocrypt
   <https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt>`__ library for performing
   encryption and decryption.

.. _qe-reference-shared-library-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

You can configure how your driver searches for the {+shared-library+}
through the following parameters:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: 30 70

    * - Name
      - Description

    * - cryptSharedLibPath
      - | Specifies the absolute path to the {+shared-library+} package,
        | {+shared-library-package+}.
        | **Default**: ``undefined``

    * - cryptSharedRequired
      - | Specifies if the driver must use the {+shared-library+}. If ``true``,
        | the driver raises an error if the {+shared-library+} is unavailable.
        | If ``false``, the driver performs the following sequence of actions:
        
        #. Attempts to use the {+shared-library+}.
        #. If the {+shared-library+} is unavailable, the driver attempts to
           spawn and connect to ``mongocryptd``.
   
        | **Default**: ``false``

To view an example demonstrating how to configure these parameters, see
the :ref:`Quick Start <qe-quick-start-shared-lib>`.
