You can install Relational Migrator on a single Mac machine. This 
installation method uses default settings and binds Relational Migrator to a single 
IP and port.

Steps
-----

1. Download the latest MacOS Relational Migrator binary from the 
   `release page <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator>`__.

#. Double-click the ``MongoDB.Relational.Migrator-X.X.X.dmg`` file.

#. Drag the ``MongoDB Relational Migrator.app`` icon into the ``/Applications`` folder.

#. (Optional) To connect to Oracle or MySQL drivers, download and place the drivers into your Relational Migrator directory.

   a. To download and install MySQL or Oracle drivers, see the following:
      
      - `MySQL: latest 8.3.x version, Platform Independent Version <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/>`_

      - `Oracle: 21.6.0.0 of ojdbc11.jar from the Oracle 21c <https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html>`_

   b. Copy the driver files to ``/Library/Application Support/MongoDB/Relational Migrator/Drivers``.

      .. note::

         Relational Migrator installs the JDBC drivers for SQL Server and PostgreSQL 
         by default.

#. Open Launchpad and search for **MongoDB Relational Migrator**. 

   Double-click the Relational Migrator icon to start the application.
