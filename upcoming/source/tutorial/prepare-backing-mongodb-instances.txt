Before you install |onprem|, you must deploy its supporting databases.
These are called :term:`backing databases`. These databases include the
:ref:`mms-application-database` and the
:term:`backup database <Backup Database>`. The following table
compares the |onprem| Application Database and the Backup Database:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 30 30

   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Frequently Asked Questions
     - :term:`Application Database <application database>`
     - :term:`Backup Database`

   * - What does the database store?
     - :red:`WARNING:` The following items can contain sensitive data. To prevent 
       unauthorized access and protect sensitive data, you must 
       :doc:`secure </tutorial/configure-ssl-connection-to-backing-mongodb>`
       the :ref:`mms-application-database`.

       - |onprem| operational data.
     
       - MongoDB database logs that you can :doc:`retrieve and view 
         </tutorial/view-logs>` using |onprem|. 
       
       - Unoptimized queries if you enabled :ref:`Performance 
         Advisor <project-settings-general>`, which 
         analyzes logs to recommend performance improvements in the 
         :ref:`performance-advisor` page.

       - Real-time metrics if you enabled :ref:`Real Time Performance Panel 
         <project-settings-general>`, which collects and displays real time metrics from your MongoDB databases in the :ref:`Real Time Metrics 
         <real-time-metrics-status-tab>` page. |onprem| deletes the data 
         when you navigate away from the ``Real Time Metrics`` page.

     - - :manual:`Oplog </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>` data
       - Temporary sync data
       - Your :manual:`snapshots </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>`, depending on your configuration

   * - Is the database necessary?
     - Yes
     - No, unless you use |onprem| to
       :doc:`backup </core/backup-overview>` the databases that
       |onprem| manages.

   * - How should the database store the data?
     - Dedicated :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` on independent storage volume
     - Dedicated :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` per backup database on independent
       storage volumes

   * - Can the database use more than one deployment?
     - No
     - :doc:`Yes </tutorial/configure-backup-high-availability>`

   * - Can |onprem| use the Automation module with this database?
     - No
     - Yes

   * - Can |onprem| use the Backup Module to back up this database?
     - No
     - No

   * - Can |onprem| use the Monitoring module to monitor this database?
     - :ref:`Yes<consider-monitoring-appdb>`
     - Yes

.. note::

   Each backing database must use a dedicated replica set. *The replica
   set can't store other data*.

   Running regular backups, a backup database could fill a volume. If
   the application database cannot write to a volume, |onprem| stops.
   Proper storage setup reduces the risk of |onprem| failures.

Considerations
--------------

Replica Set Topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each :term:`backing database <backing databases>` :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`
should include three data-bearing members for high availability. If you
lack storage capacity for three data-bearing members, the third member
of a backing database may be an :term:`arbiter`.

For the |onprem| :term:`application database`, you may run one member
of the replica set on the same host as |onprem|.

.. important:: Backing Databases with fewer than three data-bearing members

   When writing to its :term:`backing databases`, |onprem| uses the
   :guilabel:`Replica Acknowledged` (``w:2``)
   :manual:`write concern </reference/write-concern>`. This write
   concern reports a write as successful *only* after the primary *and*
   one secondary acknowledge that write. This means that if a backing
   database loses one of the two data-bearing members, MongoDB stops
   write operations.

.. warning:: Default read and write concerns

   The :manual:`default MongoDB read and write concerns 
   </reference/mongodb-defaults/>` for your MongoDB version should 
   match the default read and write concerns for your 
   :term:`backing databases` and your :term:`application database`. If 
   you set a different read or write concern, you might experience data 
   loss.

.. _consider-monitoring-appdb:

Application Database Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose to monitor the application database after you install
|onprem|.

To monitor your application database:

1. Finish installing the backing databases.
#. Install |application|.
#. :setting:`Enable Monitoring <Application Database Monitoring>` for
   the application database.

   a. :doc:`Install the {+mdbagent+} </tutorial/install-mongodb-agent-to-monitor>`
      on the application database hosts.
   b. :doc:`Add the application database </tutorial/enable-appdb-monitoring>`
      through the |onprem| UI.

.. seealso::

   To follow the full procedure, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/enable-appdb-monitoring`.

.. _requirements-backing-db-replica-sets:

Prerequisites
-------------

Replica Set Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` that host the |onprem|
:term:`backing databases` must:

Use Dedicated Databases
```````````````````````

The :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` must store data to support
|onprem| metadata *only*. They must store *no other data*.

Use Backing Database for |s3| Block and Oplog Metadata
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If you use |s3| for block or oplog storage, the backing database can
store the metadata for the blocks and oplog. 

.. _compatible-mdb-versions:

Use a Compatible MongoDB Version
````````````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-compatible-mongodb-versions.rst

Use the WiredTiger Storage Engine for the Application Database
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Use :manual:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>` for the |onprem|
application database.

Use the WiredTiger Storage Engine for the Backup Database
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

For backup database configuration options, see
:doc:`Backup Preparations </core/backup-preparations>`.

Use Queries that Do Not Require Indexes
```````````````````````````````````````

Do *not* run the :term:`backing databases` with the MongoDB
``--notablescan`` parameter set. When set, this parameter
specifies that all queries must use indexes.

.. _backing-instances-security:

Replica Set Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Secure the Connection to the Backing Databases
``````````````````````````````````````````````

Ensure that connections from |onprem| to your :term:`backing databases`
are secure. Configure these databases to accept connections from
|onprem| that :ref:`only use TLS <configure-ssl-backing>`.

Configure an Authentication Mechanism for the Backing Databases
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Limit access to your backing databases to specific MongoDB users using
an :term:`authentication mechanism`. To configure your backing
databases to use authentication, see :ref:`configure-auth-backing`.

Grant Minimal Roles to the |mms| User that Accesses the Backing Databases
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Set these users to have the :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase` and
:authrole:`dbAdminAnyDatabase` roles. If a backing database is a
sharded cluster, add :authrole:`clusterAdmin`, otherwise add
:authrole:`clusterMonitor`.

.. _backing-instances-prerequisites:

Host Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The hosts that run the :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` must meet the
following requirements for:

Hardware
````````

The hosts must meet :ref:`mms-application-database-specifications` or
:ref:`backup-database-specifications` depending on which database
the host runs. If a host serves other |onprem| components in
addition to the database, you must sum the hardware requirements for
each component to determine the requirements for the host.

System Configuration
````````````````````

The hosts must be configured according to the requirements given in
the :manual:`MongoDB Production Notes </administration/production-notes>`
except where explicitly contradicted in this tutorial. The Production
Notes include information on ulimits, NUMA, and other configuration
options.

Hostnames
`````````

Use lowercase |fqdn|\s. If you use uppercase characters, |onprem| may
fail to find your backing database. To learn more about naming hosts,
see :rfc:`RFC 1178 <1178>`.

Networking
``````````

Host network security must allow the needed ports described in
:doc:`/reference/firewall-configuration`. The appropriate inbound
and outbound firewall rules for each host must allow access to the
required ports.

|rhel| and CentOS 6 hosts only
``````````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/rhel-ulimit-conf-file.rst

|rhel| and CentOS hosts running SELinux in ``enforcing`` mode
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If the hosts are not configured to use the default MongoDB
:option:`data <mongod.--dbpath>` or :option:`log <mongod.--logpath>`
paths or :manual:`ports </reference/default-mongodb-port>` and are
enforcing SELinux policies, update the SELinux policies before
starting the :term:`backing databases`.

To learn how to update the SELinux policy:

- For MongoDB Community edition, see
  :ref:`Configure SELinux <install-rhel-configure-selinux>`

- For MongoDB Enterprise edition, see
  :ref:`Configure SELinux <install-enterprise-rhel-configure-selinux>`

Deploy Backing Databases
------------------------

To deploy MongoDB :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` to host the
|onprem| :term:`backing databases`:

.. include:: /includes/procedures/deploy-backing-dbs.rst

Next Steps
----------

- When you install |onprem|, you must set the :setting:`mongo.mongoUri`
  setting to connect to the :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` you created for the
  application database in this tutorial.

- If you enable backup for your |onprem| deployment, you must
  :doc:`configure the oplog store </tutorial/manage-oplog-storage>` to
  use the replica set that you created for the backup database in this
  tutorial. If you *also* choose to use a :opsmgr:`blockstore </reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-blockstore-database>` or
  :opsmgr:`S3 snapshot store  </reference/glossary/#std-term-S3-Snapshot-Store>` to store your
  :manual:`snapshots </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>`, you must
  :manual:`deploy one Replica Set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>` for
  each :doc:`blockstore </tutorial/manage-blockstore-storage>` or
  :doc:`S3 blockstore </tutorial/manage-s3-blockstore-storage>`
  metadata database.
