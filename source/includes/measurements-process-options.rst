   * - Option
     - Type
     - Description
     - Required?

   * - ``<hostname>:<port>``
     - String
     - The hostname of the server running the |service| MongoDB process
       and the port to which the process listens.
     - yes

   * - ``granularity``
     - String
     - An ISO-8601-formatted time period that specifies the interval
       between measurement data points. For example, ``PT1M`` specifies
       1-minute granularity.

       The following subset of ISO-8601-formatted time periods are 
       supported:

       - ``PT1M``
       - ``PT5M``
       - ``PT1H``
       - ``P1D``

       When you specify ``granularity``, you must specify either ``period``
       *or* ``start`` and ``end``.
     - yes

   * - ``period``
     - String
     - An ISO-8601-formatted time period that specifies the length of time in
       the past to query. For example, to request the last 36 hours, specify:
       ``period=P1DT12H``. Mutually exclusive with ``start`` and ``end``.
     - yes

   * - ``start``
     - String
     - The time at which to start retrieving measurements, as specified by an
       ISO-8601 timestamp string. If you specify ``start`` you must also
       specify ``end``. Mutually exclusive with ``period``.
     - yes

   * - ``end``
     - String
     - The time at which to stop retrieving measurements, as specified by an
       ISO-8601 timestamp string. If you specify ``end`` you must also
       specify ``start``. Mutually exclusive with ``period``.
     - yes

   * - ``type``
     - String
     - Specifies which measurement to return. If ``type`` is not specified, all
       measurements are returned.

       You must specify measurements that are valid for the host. |service|
       returns an error if any specified measurements are invalid.

       The following measurement values are valid:

       .. list-table::

          * - - ``DISK_PARTITION_IOPS_READ``
              - ``DISK_PARTITION_IOPS_WRITE``
              - ``DISK_PARTITION_IOPS_TOTAL``
       
            - Measures throughput of I/O operations for the disk partition used for
              MongoDB.
       
          * - - ``DISK_PARTITION_UTILIZATION``
       
            - The percentage of time during which requests are being issued to and
              serviced by the partition. This includes requests from any process, not
              just MongoDB processes.
       
          * - - ``DISK_PARTITION_LATENCY_READ``
              - ``DISK_PARTITION_LATENCY_WRITE``
       
            - Measures latency per operation type of the disk partition used by
              MongoDB.
       
          * - - ``DISK_PARTITION_SPACE_FREE``
              - ``DISK_PARTITION_SPACE_USED``
              - ``DISK_PARTITION_SPACE_PERCENT_FREE``
              - ``DISK_PARTITION_SPACE_PERCENT_USED``
       
            - Measures the free disk space and used disk space on the disk partition
              used by MongoDB.
     - no
