You can create and manage private endpoints for |gcp| using
:gcp:`{+google-psc+} </vpc/docs/private-service-connect>`. |service|
currently supports the use of {+google-psc+} via the |service|
API. Full UI support for |gcp| {+google-psc+} is coming soon.

Connecting to |service| clusters with private endpoints helps to ensure your
perceived network trust boundary is not extended. These one-way connections
prevent |service| |vpc|\s from initiating connections back to
your |gcp| |vpc|\s.

Overview
--------

|service| uses internal load balancers and :gcp:`service
attachments </vpc/docs/private-service-connect#service-attachments>` to
connect your clusters to your |vpc|. {+google-psc+} uses one load balancer per
node. To ensure the availability of resources for both current and future clusters,
|service| creates all the service attachments and internal load balancers for a
region when you activate {+google-psc+} for that region.

Connection Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. :doc:`Create the endpoint service for a region
   </reference/api/private-endpoints-service-create-one>` in |service| to enable the
   feature. After you enable {+google-psc+}, |service| does the following actions:

   - Creates its own |vpc|. If |service| is already using a |vpc| for |gcp|
     resources, |service| will use the existing |vpc|.
   - Creates 50 load balancers and service attachments for that region.
   - Places existing clusters within the region behind a network load balancer in
     the |service| |vpc|. |service| creates a separate load balancer for each node within
     every cluster.
   - Reserves any remaining load balancers and service attachments for your future
     clusters within that region.
   
#. :doc:`Get the endpoint service for the region
   </reference/api/private-endpoints-service-create-one>` in |service| to retrieve
   the service attachment names. 

   .. note::
   
     You can't retrieve the service attachment names or complete the next steps
     until |service| finishes creating the endpoint service. Wait for the
     ``Status`` value to become ``AVAILABLE`` when you :doc:`get the endpoint service for the region
     </reference/api/private-endpoints-service-create-one>` before proceeding.

#. Follow |gcp|'s steps for :gcp:`configuring {+google-psc+} to access
   services </vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-services>`, including
   the following steps: 

   - Create private endpoints. Each private endpoint reserves an IP address
     within your |gcp| |vpc| and forwards traffic from the endpoints' IP
     addresses to the service attachments. You must create an equal number of
     private endpoints to the number of service attachments. The default number
     of service attachments is 50.

#. :doc:`Create a private endpoint group
   </reference/api/private-endpoints-endpoint-create-one>` in |service|, which
   represents the collection of 50 forwarding rules. You must specify the
   following items: 
  
   - Static IP addresses you reserved.
   - Names of the forwarding rules you created.

   When creating private endpoint groups, you can: 
   
   - Create multiple endpoint groups in a region. This allows you to create
     multiple connection strings for a cluster.
   - Create one endpoint group per region for a single multi-region cluster.

   .. note::

      You can't use multiple endpoint groups per region and multi-region
      clusters with {+google-psc+} at the same time.

#. |service| uses the forwarding rules to provide a secure one-way connection
   from your |gcp| |vpc| to the network load balancers in the |service| |vpc|.
   You can find the connection string in the response body when you :doc:`get
   one cluster </reference/api/clusters-get-one>` or :doc:`get all clusters
   </reference/api/clusters-get-all>` from the region.

Considerations
--------------

The following considerations apply to |gcp| private endpoints:

High Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You don't need to take additional actions to ensure that |gcp| private endpoint
connections to |service| can withstand an availability zone outage.

IP Access Lists and Network Peering Connections with Private Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you enable private endpoints, you can still enable access to your
|service| clusters using other methods, such as adding public IPs to
:doc:`IP access lists </security/ip-access-list>` and
:doc:`network peering </security-vpc-peering>`.

Procedures
----------

To enable connections through {+google-psc+}, :doc:`complete the prerequisites
and create the endpoint group
</reference/api/private-endpoints-endpoint-create-one>` using the
|service| API.
