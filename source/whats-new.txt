- Improves the performance of BSON to JSON serialization for 
  nested documents

Fixes
`````

- Updates the truncated output of the ``bson_as_json_with_opts()`` function to no
  longer split valid UTF-8 sequences

- Updates generated JSON text in the following ways:

  - Serializes all empty arrays and documents with one space
  - Serializes arrays that the driver omits because of the maximum recursion limit
    to ``[ ... ]`` instead of ``{ ... }``
  - Applies the maximum recursion limit to legacy CodeWScope documents

- Fixes an output parameter leaked after unsuccessful calls to the 
  ``bson_append_array_builder_begin()`` function

{+libmongoc+}
~~~~~~~~~

The 1.30.0 release of ``{+libmongoc+}`` includes the following changes:

Deprecations
````````````

- Deprecates support for Debian 9 and Debian 10

New Features
````````````

- Adds support for structured logging. To configure this feature, use
  the ``mongoc_client_set_structured_log_opts()`` and ``mongoc_client_pool_set_structured_log_opts()``
  functions.

- Adds support for cache lifetime configuration of In-Use Encryption data
  encryption keys. To configure this feature, use the ``mongoc_auto_encryption_opts_set_key_expiration()``
  and ``mongoc_client_encryption_opts_set_key_expiration()`` functions.

  To learn more about In-Use Encryption, see :manual:`In-Use Encryption </core/security-in-use-encryption/>`
  in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

- Adds support for the ``sort`` option for update and replace operations.

- Adds support for constructing a ``mongoc_bulkwrite_t`` type without
  a client by using the ``mongoc_bulkwrite_new()`` and ``mongoc_bulkwrite_set_client()``
  functions.

Improvements
````````````

- Improves the performance of the ``mongoc_server_description_new_copy()``
  function

Fixes
`````

- Includes the following APM event fixes required by the
  :spec:`SDAM specification </server-selection/server-selection.md>`:

  - After delivering a ``server_opening`` event, the driver must deliver a
    corresponding ``server_closed`` event before delivering ``topology_closed``
  - Before delivering a ``topology_closed`` event, the driver delivers a ``topology_changed``
    event that has a ``new_description`` of type ``Unknown``

- Fixes possible crashes when the driver reports the inserted document
  IDs in the verbose results of client bulk writes
