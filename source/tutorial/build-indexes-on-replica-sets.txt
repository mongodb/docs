=============================
Build Indexes on Replica Sets
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

For replica sets, secondaries will begin building indexes *after* the
:term:`primary` finishes building the index. In :term:`sharded clusters
<sharded cluster>`, the :program:`mongos` will send :method:`ensureIndex()
<db.collection.ensureIndex()>` to the primary members of the replica
set for each shard, which then replicate to the secondaries after the
primary finishes building the index.

To minimize the impact of building an index on your replica set, use
the following procedure to build indexes:

.. see:: :doc:`/administration/indexes` and :doc:`/core/indexes` for
   more information.

Considerations
--------------

- Ensure that your :term:`oplog` is large enough to permit the
  indexing or re-indexing operation to complete without falling
  too far behind to catch up. See the :ref:`oplog sizing
  <replica-set-oplog-sizing>` documentation for additional
  information.

- This procedure *does* take one member out of the replica set at a
  time. However, this procedure will only affect one member of the
  set at a time rather than *all* secondaries at the same time.

- Do **not** use this procedure when building a :ref:`unique index
  <index-type-unique>` with the ``dropDups`` option.

- Before version 2.6 :ref:`Background index creation operations
  <index-creation-background>` become *foreground* indexing operations
  on :term:`secondary` members of replica sets. After 2.6, background
  index builds replicate as background index builds on the
  secondaries.


Procedure
---------

.. note::

   If you need to build an index in a :term:`sharded cluster`, repeat
   the following procedure for each replica set that provides each
   :term:`shard`.

.. _tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-stop-one-member:

Stop One Secondary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stop the :program:`mongod` process on one secondary. Restart the
:program:`mongod` process *without* the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`
option and running on a different port. [#different-port]_ This
instance is now in "standalone" mode.

For example, if your :program:`mongod` *normally* runs with on the
default port of ``27017`` with the :option:`--replSet
<mongod --replSet>` option you would use the following invocation:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --port 47017

.. [#different-port] By running the :program:`mongod` on a different
   port, you ensure that the other members of the replica set and all
   clients will not contact the member while you are building the
   index.

.. _tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-build-index:

Build the Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the new index using the :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()`
in the :program:`mongo` shell, or comparable method in your
driver. This operation will create or rebuild the index on this
:program:`mongod` instance

For example, to create an ascending index on the ``username`` field of
the ``records`` collection, use the following :program:`mongo` shell
operation:

.. code-block:: sh

   db.records.ensureIndex( { username: 1 } )

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/create-an-index` and
   :doc:`/tutorial/create-a-compound-index` for more information.

.. _tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-restart-mongod:

Restart the Program ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the index build completes, start the :program:`mongod` instance
with the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option on its usual port:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --port 27017 --replSet rs0

Modify the port number (e.g. ``27017``) or the replica set name
(e.g. ``rs0``) as needed.

Allow replication to catch up on this member.

Build Indexes on all Secondaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each secondary in the set, build an index according to the
following steps:

#. :ref:`tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-stop-one-member`
#. :ref:`tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-build-index`
#. :ref:`tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-restart-mongod`

Build the Index on the Primary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build an index on the primary you can either:

#. :doc:`Build the index in the background
   </tutorial/build-indexes-in-the-background>` on the primary.

#. Step down the primary using the :method:`rs.stepDown()` method in
   the :program:`mongo` shell to cause the current primary to become a
   secondary graceful and allow the set to elect another member as
   primary.

   Then repeat the index building procedure, listed below, to build the
   index on the primary:

   #. :ref:`tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-stop-one-member`

   #. :ref:`tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-build-index`

   #. :ref:`tutorial-index-on-replica-sets-restart-mongod`

Building the index on the background, takes longer than the foreground
index build and results in a less compact index structure. Additionally,
the background index build may impact write performance on the
primary. However, building the index in the background allows the set to
be continuously up for write operations during while MongoDB builds the
index.
