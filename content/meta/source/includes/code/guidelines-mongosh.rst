Shell Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For shell commands, use the following guidelines when creating blocks 
of code as input or output examples:

-  When showing input, do not include a command prompt (such as $).

-  As often as necessary, show input and output in separate blocks and
   provide explanations for each. For example, if the input contains
   arguments or parameters, explain those. If the user should expect
   something specific in the output, or you want to show only part of
   lengthy output, provide an explanation.

-  When the command is simple, and there's nothing specific to say
   about the output, you can show the input and output using the 
   ``.. io-code-block::`` directive.

-  For readability, you can break up long lines of shell input into 
   readable blocks by ending each line with a backslash (``\``).

-  If the input includes a list of arguments or parameters, use alphabetical order.
   If you explain the arguments or parameters in text, show them in the same order that
   they appear in the code block.

-  Use placeholder and variable text as directed in :ref:`placeholder-variable-text`.
