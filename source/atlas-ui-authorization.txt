You can manage access to your |service| {+database-deployments+} with 
:doc:`Atlas User Roles </reference/user-roles/>`. You can apply these
permissions only on the organization level or the project level. So, 
plan the hierarchy of your organizations and projects carefully.

|service| User Roles
--------------------

|service| user roles define the actions |service| users can perform in
organizations, projects, or both. Organization and project ``Owners``
can manage |service| users and their roles within their respective
organizations and projects. To learn more, see :ref:`user-roles`.

Organizations
-------------

An organization can contain multiple projects (previously referred to
as groups). Under this hierarchy structure:

.. include:: /includes/list-projects-hierarchy.rst

To learn more, see :ref:`manage-projects`.

Invitations
-----------

The :guilabel:`Invitations` tab allows you to view and accept
pending invitations to |service| organizations and projects. To learn 
more, see :ref:`view-invitations`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-project-invite-deprecation.rst

Programmatic Access
-------------------

To grant programmatic access to an organization or project using only
the :doc:`API </api>`, you can create an |api| key for the 
{+atlas-admin-api+}. To learn more, see :ref:`programmatic-access`.
