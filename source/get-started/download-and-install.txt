   .. step:: Install dependencies

      Before you being developing, ensure you have the following dependencies
      installed in your development environment:
      
      - `JDK <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/>`__ version 8 or later
      - `sbt <https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html>`__ version 1 or later

   .. step:: Create a project directory

      Run the following command in your shell to create a directory
      called ``scala-quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir scala-quickstart

      Select the tab corresponding to your operating system and run the following commands
      to create a ``build.sbt`` file in the ``scala-quickstart`` directory:

      .. tabs::

          .. tab:: macOS / Linux
             :tabid: create-file-mac-linux

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd scala-quickstart
                touch build.sbt

          .. tab:: Windows
             :tabid: create-file-windows

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd scala-quickstart
                type nul > build.sbt

   .. step:: Configure your project to use the {+driver-short+}

      Navigate to your ``build.sbt`` file and add the following code to use
      the {+driver-short+} in your application:

      .. code-block:: none
         
         ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "{+language-version+}"
         libraryDependencies += "org.mongodb.scala" %% "mongo-scala-driver" % "{+full-version+}"

      This code configures your application to use Scala version {+language-version+} and
      {+driver-short+} version {+full-version+}.

After you complete these steps, you have a new project directory with the driver
dependencies installed.
