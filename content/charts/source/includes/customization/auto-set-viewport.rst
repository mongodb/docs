Automatically Set Viewport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, geospatial charts show a map which includes all the data
point markers in your specified collection. You can pan and zoom to
change the map view, but if you close the chart and re-open it the map
reverts to its default state. This behavior is controlled by the
:guilabel:`Automatically Set Viewport` option.

When you toggle the :guilabel:`Automatically Set Viewport` switch to
``Off``, the area and zoom level at which the map is saved becomes the
new default view.

.. note::

   You can pan and zoom the map area in a chart on a dashboard, but
   these changes do not affect the default map view.
