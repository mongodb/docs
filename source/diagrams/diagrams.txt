Schema Visualizer maintains entity-relationship diagrams that
show tables, foreign key relationships, and data types. This helps you
optimize how you represent your relational data in MongoDB. Diagrams also
let you see how your mapping rules shape your MongoDB schema.

When you finish :ref:`creating a migration project
<rm-create-project-live>`, Relational Migrator creates a new diagram
based on your project's mapping rules. There are two views:

- The :guilabel:`Relational` view represents the tables in your relational
  database. It only updates if you change your project's data model.

- The :guilabel:`MongoDB` view represents the collections in your MongoDB
  database. It updates any time you :ref:`change your project's mapping rules <mapping-rules-edit>`.

You can also use `Hackolade <https://hackolade.com/>`__ to visualize your schemas.
