Encoding channels are the building blocks of your visualizations.
These channels are the means by which |charts-short| translates data
from your :manual:`collection </core/databases-and-collections/>` to
the visualization. The encoding process dictates how that data
appears in the chart based on the :ref:`channel type
<charts-channel-type-table>` selected.

.. _charts-channel-type-table:

Encoding Channel Types
----------------------

Each encoding channel type provides different capabilities for
processing and visualizing your data. Each channel type accepts
distinct data types (e.g., ``string`` versus ``numeric``
data). The following table describes each encoding channel type in
|charts|:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Encoding Channel Type
     - Description

   * - Value
     - A point on the chart is created from the chosen field for each
       document in the collection. You may only assign fields with a
       ``numeric`` or ``date`` type to a :guilabel:`Value` channel.

   * - Category
     - Each *unique* value from this field in the collection is used
       as a chart category. The :guilabel:`Category` encoding channel
       provides the following additional visualization options:

       - For fields with a ``string`` data type, you can specify a
         field to :ref:`sort <charts-sort-data>` on and the sort order.

       - For fields with a ``numeric`` data type, you can toggle
         :ref:`data binning <charts-bin-data>` and select the bin size.

       - For fields with a ``date`` data type, you can toggle date
         grouping and select the grouping period.

   * - Aggregation
     - A point on the chart is created by applying an
       :manual:`aggregation <aggregation>` function over the values of
       this field from multiple documents. For more
       information on aggregation in |charts-short|, see the
       :ref:`Aggregation <building-charts-aggregation>` section.

   * - Geopoint
     - When you create a chart using a geopoint channel type, |charts|
       renders a map to visualize your data. A mark is plotted on the
       map for each document containing the selected field based on
       the field's latitude and longitude values. Geopoint channel
       types are used in the :guilabel:`Coordinates` channel on
       :guilabel:`Geospatial Scatter` and
       :guilabel:`Geospatial Heatmap` chart types.

       For more information on the geopoint encoding channel type,
       refer to the :ref:`Geopoint Channel Type <geopoint-channel>`
       section.

|charts-short| shows required encoding channels in green, and
optional encoding channels in blue.

.. _building-charts-aggregation:

Aggregation
-----------

Dragging a field onto an :guilabel:`aggregation`
:ref:`encoding channel <encoding-channels>` allows you to use an
:manual:`aggregation pipeline operator </reference/operator/aggregation/>`
on that field. The aggregation operators available in the chart
builder change based on the :manual:`data type </reference/bson-types/>`
of the selected field. MongoDB Charts categorizes the field data type
as either a ``number``, ``string``, or ``date`` and displays
appropriate aggregation options accordingly.

.. example::

   Donut charts provide two encoding channels:

   - A :guilabel:`category` channel called :guilabel:`Label` dictating
     which field to use when dividing the sections of the chart.

   - An :guilabel:`aggregation` channel called :guilabel:`Arc` dictating
     the aggregation operation to perform on the :guilabel:`Label`
     category.

   The following donut chart examines NASA's Landslide data source to
   show the frequency of various landslide triggers by performing a
   :manual:`$count </reference/operator/aggregation/count/>` aggregation
   on the ``trigger`` field:

   .. figure:: /images/charts/donut-chart-example-2.png
      :figwidth: 720px
      :alt: Donut chart example

   We see from the chart that the most common landslide trigger is
   ``Downpour`` followed by ``Rain``.

.. _geopoint-channel:

Geopoint Channel Type
---------------------

Geopoint channel types are used in the :guilabel:`Coordinates` channel
on :guilabel:`Geospatial Scatter` and :guilabel:`Geospatial Heatmap`
chart types. Geospatial charts visualize data that references specific
geographic locations.

|charts| automatically determines which fields in your dataset, if
any, are :manual:`GeoJSON Points </reference/geojson/>`.
|charts-short| signifies these fields with a :icon-charts:`geoglobe`
icon. You can map these fields directly to a geopoint channel type
by dragging them onto an appropriate geopoint channel type in
the chart builder. |charts-short| automatically determines the latitude
and longitude values from the field and adds a point to the map for
each document.

.. note::

   You can also assign numeric coordinates or arrays to a
   geopoint channel type to specify latitude and
   longitude not stored as :manual:`GeoJSON Points
   </reference/geojson/#point>`. For details on this process, see the
   following section.

Assign Non-GeoJSON Fields to a Geopoint Channel Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to use fields not stored as
:manual:`GeoJSON Points </reference/geojson/#point>` in a
geopoint channel type.

- You can drag numeric fields onto a geopoint channel type to
  specify latitude and longitude. When you drag a numeric field onto a
  geopoint channel type, the channel updates to use the selected field
  as either :guilabel:`Latitude` or :guilabel:`Longitude`.
  |charts-short| prompts you for a second numeric field to fill in the
  other value.

- Alternatively, you can drag a numeric array onto a 
  geopoint channel type to specify location coordinates
  from a field. When you use this approach, you can specify which
  indexes of the array to use for latitude and longitude components.

For additional information and examples on :guilabel:`Geospatial`
:guilabel:`Scatter` and :guilabel:`Heatmap` charts which utilize
geopoint channel types, refer to the relevant chart type pages.

Surface Missing Fields in the Chart Builder
-------------------------------------------

|charts| populates the :guilabel:`Fields` pane of the
chart builder by randomly sampling documents from the selected
data source. As a result, |charts-short| may not display all fields
from documents in the data source if the field is not present on all
documents.

To surface a specific field in the chart builder, you can use the
:ref:`Query Bar <query-bar>` to define certain fields which must
appear in the sampled documents.

.. example::

   The following MQL query, when executed in the query bar,
   ensures that  the ``customer_satisfaction`` field is included
   in the :guilabel:`Fields` pane.

   .. code-block:: json

      { "customer_satisfaction": { $exists: true } }

   This query guarantees that you can interact with the
   ``customer_satisfaction`` field and include the field in chart
   construction.
