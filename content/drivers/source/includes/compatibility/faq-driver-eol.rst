When will my driver version reach EOL?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New driver versions are fully compatible with any {+mdb-server+} version that reached
EOL within the last three years. After this period, new driver
versions might not be fully compatible with the EOL {+mdb-server+} versions.

For example, MongoDB Server {+one-mdb-version-back+} reaches EOL on
{+one-mdb-version-back-eol-date+}. All |driver| releases until
{+one-mdb-version-back-eol-date-plus-three-years+} will be fully compatible with
{+mdb-server+} {+one-mdb-version-back+}.

To ensure long-term compatibility and security, we recommend upgrading your driver
before your version of {+mdb-server+} reaches EOL. 
To learn more about {+mdb-server+} release and EOL dates, see
`MongoDB Software Lifecycle Schedules <https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy/lifecycles>`__.
