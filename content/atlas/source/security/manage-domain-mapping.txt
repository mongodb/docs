You can map domains to your |idp| to streamline the login experience
for users from specified domains by authenticating them through an
|idp|. Domain mapping ensures that all users with a particular domain
in their email address have the same login experience.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/use-alternate-idp-multiple-mapped-domains.rst

To map a domain to your |idp|, you must verify that you own the
domain. You can either:

- Upload an |html| file containing a verification key to a host in your
  domain or

- Create a |dns| :wikipedia:`TXT record <TXT_record?oldid=930320014>`
  that contains a verification key.

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial, you must have already linked an |idp| to
|service|. To learn how to link an |idp| to |service|, see
