===================================
Preparing Backing MongoDB Instances
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

A backing MongoDB instance is a dedicated replica set that hosts a
:ref:`backing database <backing-database>` where MMS stores data. Backing
instances are dedicated to MMS operations and do not store any other data.

MMS requires separate backing MongoDB instances for the :ref:`MMS
Application Database <mms-application-database>` and for the :ref:`MMS
Backup Blockstore Database <mms-backup-blockstore-database>`

Considerations
--------------

All backing MongoDB instances must be running MongoDB 2.4.9 or
later.

.. _mms-application-database-specifications:

MMS Application Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MMS requires the :ref:`MMS Application Database
<mms-application-database>` to hold monitoring information.

Topology
````````

The backing MongoDB instance for the database should be a single
three-member MongoDB replica set. If you cannot allocate space for three
databases, you may deploy 2 :program:`mongod` instances that hold data and
an arbiter.

You may run the :ref:`MMS Application <mms-application-package>` on the same
physical server as one member of the MMS Application Database replica set. A MongoDB
standalone may also be used in place of a replica set, but this is not
recommended for production deployments.

Hardware Specifications
```````````````````````

For up to 400 monitored hosts, the MMS Application Database requires 200 GB of storage space.
For up to 2000 monitored hosts, the MMS Application Database requires 500 GB of storage space.
If you have more than 2000 monitored hosts, please contact your MongoDB Account Manager.

The MMS Application software requires 15 GB of RAM. The MMS Application
Database requires additional RAM for the monitored hosts, as follows:

- Up to 400 monitored hosts, 8 GB additional RAM.

- Up to 2000 monitored hosts, 15 GB additional RAM.

For the best results use SSD-backed storage.

MMS Backup Blockstore Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MMS Backup requires a separate, **dedicated** MongoDB replica set to hold
the Backup Service's snapshot data. This **cannot** be a replica set used
for purposes other than holding the snapshots. In particular, this cannot
be a replica set that stores the data the snapshots back up.

The replica set should have enough capacity to store 2 to 3 times the
total backed up data size.

Prior to installing MMS Backup, consider contacting your MongoDB Account
Manager to arrange a sizing consultation for the MMS Backup database.

For testing *only* you may use a standalone :program:`mongod` instance
in place of a replica set.

Prerequisites
-------------

Read the :manual:`MongoDB Production Notes
</administration/production-notes>` before installing
MongoDB and other software on your servers. If you are deploying MMS
on Amazon AWS, please see ::doc:`/tutorial/configure-aws-hosts`.

The MMS Application requires :query:`$where`. As a result, you must
ensure that :setting:`security.javaScriptEnabled` is ``true``, which
is the default, for all backing :program:`mongod` instances.

Procedures
----------

To create replica sets, start the :program:`mongod` instances for each
member of a new replica set, configure the replica set, then add the
:program:`mongod` instances to the replica set.

The :manual:`Deploy a Replica Set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>` guide
has step by step details how to setup and deploy replica sets for use as
backing MongoDBs for MMS.

Each backing instance should be a single three-member MongoDB replica
set. If you cannot allocate 3 data instances, you may deploy 2
:program:`mongod` instances that hold data and one arbiter.

For additional information on installing MongoDB, see :manual:`Install
MongoDB </installation/>`.
