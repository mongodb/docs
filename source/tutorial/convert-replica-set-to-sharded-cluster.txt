a :term:`sharded cluster`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/convert-replica-set-to-sharded-cluster.rst

After you convert a replica set to a sharded cluster, you can enable
sharding for a database and shard collections. See
:ref:`convert-shard-collection` for instructions on how to shard
collections.

If you need to add additional shards to support greater capacity, click
on the wrench menu for the sharded cluster to create additional shards.
