:program:`mongobiuser` allows you to create, drop, and list users within a
MongoDB Business Intelligence Connector running on the same host.

There must be at least one user created in order for Business Intelligence
Connector to function.

:program:`mongobiuser` has several subcommands that perform different actions:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Command
     - Arguments
     - Description

   * - ``mongobiuser create``

     - ``[create-flags] [username] [url]``

     - Creates a new user in the Business Intelligence Connector and associate
       them with the corresponding MongoDB :ref:`connection string <mongodb-uri>`.

       If the MongoDB instance uses
       :doc:`Transport Encryption </core/security-transport-encryption>`, you
       must use the ``ssl=true`` option allowed in
       `PyMongo connection strings <https://api.mongodb.org/python/current/examples/tls.html>`_.

   * - ``mongobiuser drop``

     - ``[username]``

     - Delete the given ``[username]`` and all data associated with them from
       the Business Intelligence Connector.

   * - ``mongobiuser list``

     -

     - List all users in the Business Intelligence Connector.
