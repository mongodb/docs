Each user can have up to 10 |api| keys associated with their account.
Each key can be either enabled or disabled but all count toward the 10
key limit.

An |api| key is like a password. Keep it secret.

Access Control
--------------

Your |mms| :doc:`roles </reference/user-roles>` determine which
:doc:`API resources </reference/api>` you can use. Your |mms| roles
apply to both the interface and the |api|.

Limit API Operations to Whitelisted IPv4 Addresses
--------------------------------------------------

To access whitelisted |api| operations, you must configure your
:doc:`API whitelist </reference/api/whitelist>` with the |ipv4|
addresses from which you will issue the whitelisted commands. You also
must have the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role to issue whitelisted
commands.

Address-based whitelists protect |api| operations. Only client requests
that originate from a whitelisted |ipv4| address are permitted to
perform the operations.

Users have their own whitelists and own |api| keys. When you issue an
|api| call, you must use an |api| key from your user account and must
issue the command from an address on your user account's whitelist. You
cannot use your key to issue a whitelisted |api| request from an
address on another user's whitelist, unless, of course, you've added
that address to your own whitelist.
