Activity Page
-------------

The :guilabel:`Activity` page has three sections:

#. :guilabel:`All Activity`, which shows a feed of all MMS events as well as all
   open alerts.

#. :guilabel:`Closed Alerts`, which shows a list of alerts that users have
   closed explicitly or where the metric has dropped below the
   threshold of the alert.

#. :guilabel:`Alert Settings`, which provides a window to create new alerts and
   manage existing alerts.

Procedures
----------

The :guilabel:`Alert Settings` tab on the :guilabel:`Activity` page displays all available alerts. A
:guilabel:`gear icon` drop down on the right side of each alert lets you edit,
clone, disable, or delete an alert.

Create an Alert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alerts can be created from scratch or cloned from an existing alert. To clone
an alert, see the :guilabel:`Clone an Alert` procedure below.

To create an alert:

1. Click the :guilabel:`Add Alert` button in the top right of the :guilabel:`Alert
   Settings` page. A window appears where you can configure the alert.

2. In the first section, choose the target category to monitor. Target
   categories refer to the monitored target and include: hosts, replica set,
   agents and backups.

   - If you select :guilabel:`Host`, choose the host type and then the condition or
     metric. Conditions include defining alert thresholds above or below
     metrics tracked in charts displayed when you click a hostname on the
     :guilabel:`Hosts` page, for example, ``Asserts``, ``Opcounter``, and ``Queues``.

     Alerts are sensitive to changes in host state. When a host
     changes state, MMS will automatically close alerts that are no
     longer relevant. For example, if a secondary becomes primary,
     replication lag alerts for that host will close automatically
     since the host is no longer required to replicate.

   .. only:: saas

      - If you select :guilabel:`Replica Set`, select the Primary Elected
        condition to send an alert when a new primary is elected.

   - If you select :guilabel:`Agent`, choose the agent to monitor.

   .. only:: saas

      - If you select :guilabel:`Backup`, choose which condition to use for the
        alert.

3. In the second section, choose to create an alert for *either* any monitored
   target (i.e. host, replica set, agent, or backup) *or* a subset of the
   monitored targets.

   If you want to specify a subset of monitored targets, you can
   specify the criteria used to select targets here.

.. only:: saas

   4. In the third section, you may add recipients (i.e. users or groups)
      and specify the distribution method (i.e. email addresses, and
      SMS) to define the distribution list of the alert.

      Users must ensure they have entered the correct number into the
      :guilabel:`Alerts` window. MMS removes all punctuation and letters and
      only uses the digits for the telephone number.

      .. include:: /includes/fact-intl-phone-numbers.rst

      For HipChat alerts, enter the HipChat room name and API token. Alerts
      will appear in the HipChat room message stream. See the :doc:`Settings page
      </management/settings>` to define default group alerts settings for HipChat.

      For `PagerDuty
      <http://www.pagerduty.com/?utm_source=mongodb&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partner>`_
      alerts, enter only the service key. Define escalation rules and alert
      assignments in PagerDuty. See the :doc:`Settings page
      </management/settings>` to define default group alerts settings for
      PagerDuty.

.. only:: hosted

   4. In the third section, you may add recipients (i.e. users or groups)
      and specify the distribution method (i.e. email addresses, SNMP, and
      SMS) to define the distribution list of the alert.

      For SNMP alerts, specify the hostname that will receive
      the v2c trap on standard port ``162``.

      The MIB file for SNMP is `available for download here
      <http://downloads.mongodb.com/on-prem-monitoring/MMS-10GEN-MIB.txt>`_.

      Users must ensure that they have entered the correct number into the
      :guilabel:`Alerts` window. MMS removes all punctuation and letters and
      only uses the digits for the telephone number.

      .. include:: /includes/fact-intl-phone-numbers.rst

You may also create multiple alerts with different minimum times before
notification to implement alert escalation. MMS processes alerts on a 5 minute
interval. Therefore, the minimum frequency for an alert is 5 minutes.

The time between re-notifications increases by the frequency amount every alert
cycle (e.g. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, etc.) up to
a maximum of 24 hours.

.. START-COMMENT

   - If you select **Group** and check the **SMS** box, then MMS sends
     alert text messages to all users in the group who have filled
     in their Mobile Number in the Settings page.

   - If you select **User** and check the **SMS** box, then MMS sends
     alert text messages to the user's Mobile Number specified in
     their Settings page.

   - MMS sends alert emails as multipart messages containing both HTML
     and plain text content. This way, the recipient's email client
     can choose the appropriate message format for display.

.. END-COMMENT

Costs to send alerts depend on your telephone service contract. Many factors
may affect alert delivery, including do not call lists, caps for messages
sent or delivered, delivery time of day, and message caching.

Clone an Alert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also create new alerts by cloning an existing alert then editing it.

To clone an alert:

1. On the :guilabel:`Alert Settings` tab on the :guilabel:`Activity` page,
   click the :guilabel:`gear icon` to the right of an alert. Select
   :guilabel:`Clone` to clone the alert.

2. Follow steps 2-4 described in the :ref:`Create an Alert
   <create-an-alert>` procedure.

Modify an Alert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To modify an existing alert, select the :guilabel:`Alert Settings` tab to view
all available alerts. A :guilabel:`gear icon` drop down on the right side of
each alert lets you edit an alert.

Each alert has a distribution list you can edit *and* a frequency
setting that controls how often MMS will distribute the alert.

MMS processes alerts on a 5 minute interval.

.. START-COMMENT

   Per Mike Benoit 12/17/2013, mms-docs Pull 80: The reason for the 5 minute
   minimum is that our alert processing job only executes every five minutes.
   Thus, setting this lower than 5 minutes wouldn't have any impact. This also
   means that only multiples of 5 make sense for this value.

.. END-COMMENT

Delete Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete alerts from MMS. On the :guilabel:`Alert Settings` tab on the
:guilabel:`Activity` page, click the :guilabel:`gear icon` to the right of an
alert. Select :guilabel:`Delete` to delete the alert.

Disable Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may disable and turn off alerts in MMS. On the :guilabel:`Alert Settings`
tab on the :guilabel:`Activity` page, click the :guilabel:`gear icon` to the
right of an alert. Select :guilabel:`Disable` to stop the alert.

The alert configuration remains visible in a *grayed out* state. MMS
automatically cancels active
alerts related to a disabled alert configuration.

For example, if you have an alert configured for *Host Down* and you currently
have an active alert telling you a host is down, MMS automatically
cancels active *Host Down*  alerts if you disable the default
*Host Down* configuration. MMS will send no further alerts
of this type unless the disabled alert is re-enabled.

Enable Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may reactivate disabled alerts. On the :guilabel:`Alert
Settings` tab on the :guilabel:`Activity` page, click the :guilabel:`gear icon`
to the right of a disabled alert. Select :guilabel:`Enable` to reactivate the
agent.

View Open Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view open alerts visit the :guilabel:`All Activity` tab on the
:guilabel:`Activity` page. Open alerts appear above the *Feed* section in an
*Open Alerts* section that only appears if there are open alerts. From this
window you can acknowledge an alert and select the duration of the
acknowledgment.

Once a user acknowledges an alert in the interface, MMS sends no
further notifications to the alert's distribution list until the
acknowledgement period has passed.

The distribution list receives *no* notification of alert
acknowledgment.

If you configure an alert with PagerDuty, a third-party incident management
service, you can only acknowledge the alert on your PagerDuty dashboard.
