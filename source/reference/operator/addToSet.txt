.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. operator:: $addToSet

   The :operator:`$addToSet` operator adds a value to an array only *if* the
   value is *not* in the array already. If the value *is* in the
   array, :operator:`$addToSet` returns without modifying the
   array. Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( { field: value }, { $addToSet: { field: value1 } } );

   Here, :operator:`$addToSet` appends ``value1`` to the array stored in
   ``field``, *only if* ``value1`` is not already a member of this
   array.

   .. note:: 
      
      :operator:`$addToSet` only ensures that there are no duplicate
      items added to the set and makes no guarantees regarding the order of
      the elements added, nor the order of the items in the set as a whole. 

   .. see:: :operator:`$each` and :operator:`$push`
