Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to run a database command with the
{+driver-short+}. You can use database commands to perform a variety of administrative and
diagnostic tasks, such as fetching server statistics, initializing a replica
set, or running an aggregation pipeline.

.. tip:: Prefer Driver Methods Over Database Commands

   The driver provides methods for many database commands. We recommend
   using driver methods instead of executing database commands when possible. 

   To perform administrative tasks, use the :mdb-shell:`MongoDB Shell </>` instead of the
   {+driver-short+}. Calling the MongoDB Shell :manual:`db.runCommand()
   </reference/method/db.runCommand/>` method is the preferred method to issue
   database commands, as it provides a consistent interface between the shell
   and drivers.

Run a Command
-------------

To run a database command, specify the command in a document, and pass the
document to the ``runCommand()`` method. The following code calls the
``runCommand()`` method on a database to run the ``ping`` command, which is a
no-op command used to test if a server is responsive.
