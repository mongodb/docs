Tables represent data in a tabular view, similar to a
`spreadsheet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet>`_. In |charts-short|,
tables split your data into categories, where:

- Table columns represent categorization fields.
- Table rows represent unique categories.
- Table body displays aggregated values based on the selected categorization fields.

Table Encoding Channels
-----------------------

Tables use the following :ref:`encoding channels
<encoding-channels>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Encoding Channel
     - Description

   * - Groups
     - The :guilabel:`category` encoding channels. |charts-short|
       creates a row in the table for each unique value in this field.
       When multiple :guilabel:`Groups` are added to the chart,
       |charts-short| creates a row for each unique combination of
       group fields.

       The :guilabel:`Groups` encoding channel supports
       :ref:`binning <charts-bin-data>` for numeric and date fields.

   * - Values
     - The :guilabel:`aggregation` encoding channels. |charts-short|
       creates a column for each field mapped into the
       :guilabel:`Values` channel. |charts-short|
       aggregates the encoded :guilabel:`Values` fields using the
       selected aggregation methods and populates the grid cells with
       the aggregated value for the corresponding :guilabel:`Group`.

   * - Dynamic Columns
     - A second :guilabel:`Category` encoding channel. When you use
       :guilabel:`Dynamic Columns`, |charts-short| creates table
       columns based on the unique values retrieved from the field
       mapped into the :guilabel:`Dynamic Columns` channel.
       |charts-short| uses the field mapped into the :guilabel:`Values`
       channel to populate the grid cells, aggregated against both the
       :guilabel:`Group` and :guilabel:`Dynamic Column` categories.

       You cannot apply dynamic columns to a table if you have selected
       multiple :guilabel:`Value` encoding channels.

       For an example of how to use dynamic columns, see the following
       :ref:`dynamic-col-example`.

       The :guilabel:`Dynamic Columns` encoding channel supports
       :ref:`binning <charts-bin-data>` for numeric and date fields.

Use Cases
---------

Tables have a wide variety of applications, but are most useful
when comparing multiple categories of calculated values. Visual charts
struggle to display multiple categories of data without losing their
audience. Tables present data with multiple categories such that
you can see which value applies to which slice of data.

Tables are also useful for showing precise data values, rather
than comparing approximate values. Comparing approximate values is
best done with a visual representation, instead of text.

For example, you can use tables to show:

- The total cost to rent an apartment, including rent, cleaning fees,
  and security deposits organized by location and total area of the
  unit.

- Time spent working out and total calories burned during various
  exercises categorized by the type of exercise and time of day the
  exercised was performed.

Customization Options
---------------------

The following customization options are specific to table charts. 
To see all available customization options, see
:ref:`customize-charts`.

.. _hyperlinking:

Hyperlinking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can display your data as a hyperlink.

To display your data as a hyperlink:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Customize` tab of the Chart Builder.

   .. step:: Expand the :guilabel:`Fields` section.

   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Hyperlinking` section, click :guilabel:`+ Add`.

   .. step:: Enter your URI.
      
      Your URI must:
      
      - Start with ``http://``, ``https://``, ``mailto:``, or ``tel:``.
      - Pass validation.

      To embed encoded fields in your URI, use the ``@`` symbol
      to display available fields.

   .. step:: (Optional) Hide your column.
      
      In the :guilabel:`Other Options` section, toggle :guilabel:`Hide Column` to :guilabel:`On`.

      .. note::
         
         |charts-short| returns only encoded fields. Hiding a column
         preserves the encoding of a field but omits the column from the
         results. This is useful when you want to:
      
         - Use the field as part of the URI, but don't want the
           field to render on the chart.
         - Drive :ref:`conditional formatting <conditional-formatting>`
           rules from an encoded hidden field.

To remove a hyperlink from your data:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Customize` tab of the Chart Builder.

   .. step:: Expand the :guilabel:`Fields` section.

   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Hyperlinking` section, click :icon-fa5:`trash` for the hyperlink you want to remove.

.. _wrap-text-option:

Wrap Text
~~~~~~~~~

You can wrap text that does fit in a single data cell across multiple 
lines. This setting is off by default. To turn it on:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Customize` tab of the Chart Builder.

   .. step:: Expand the :guilabel:`Fields` section.

   .. step:: Select your desired field from the dropdown menu.

   .. step:: Toggle the :guilabel:`Wrap Text` switch to enable this feature.

.. _pin-columns:

Pin Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pin :guilabel:`Group` and :guilabel:`Row Total` columns to the
side of the table. A pinned column remains fixed in place while the
rest of the table scrolls. 

To pin a column, hover over the column you want to pin and click the
:icon-fa5:`map-pin` button in the column header. The :icon-fa5:`map-pin`
button toggles on and the column pins to the side of the table: 

- A :guilabel:`Group` column pins to the left of any unpinned
  columns.
- The :guilabel:`Row Total` column pins to the right of any
  unpinned columns.

To unpin a column, click the :icon-fa5:`map-pin` button in the header of
the column you want to unpin. The :icon-fa5:`map-pin` button toggles off
and if the column is a :guilabel:`Group` column, it moves to the right
of any pinned :guilabel:`Group` columns.

Conditional Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create styling rules for table cell values that match 
conditions you define. Conditional formatting rules affect the look of 
your chart dynamically: if the value of a table cell changes to match 
or stop matching your conditions, its styling updates to reflect that.

To learn how to use conditional formatting rules, see the 
:ref:`Conditional Formatting <conditional-formatting>` 
customization option.

Examples
--------

The following table examples visualize data from a hospitality
and property service. Each document in the collection
represents a unit available for rent and includes information such as
the monthly unit price, neighborhood, and property type.

Basic Table
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table categorizes the rental listings by property
type and location, and shows the average review rating and average
weekly rent for each group:

.. figure:: /images/charts/data-table-basic-example.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Basic Table Example

The :guilabel:`Group` encoding channels of ``property_type`` and
``suburb`` create a row in the table for each unique combination
of those two fields in the data.

The :guilabel:`Values` of ``review_scores_rating`` and
``weekly_price`` each add a column to the table. For both values, we
average the rating and price for each ``property type`` and ``suburb``
using :manual:`aggregation </aggregation>` and display the results in
the table.

The results are formatted using the Customization tab to display the
mean weekly price as currency and round the mean review score to an
appropriate number of decimal places.

.. note::

   We have applied a :ref:`filter <charts-filter-documents>` to this
   chart to only display listings which have a ``weekly_price``
   associated with them.

.. _dynamic-col-example:

Table with Dynamic Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table displays nearly the same data as the previous
basic table example. In this example, instead of making
``property_type`` and ``suburb`` :guilabel:`Groups`, ``property_type``
field is now a :guilabel:`Dynamic Column`:

.. figure:: /images/charts/data-table-dynamic-example.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Basic Table Example

Now, rather than having two category columns in the table, the
``property_types`` become column titles. We are still aggregating
the mean of the ``weekly_price`` based on each combination of
``property_type`` and ``suburb``.

The results are formatted using the Customization tab to display the
mean weekly price as currency.

.. note::

   Blank table cells indicate that there are no documents that match
   the corresponding intersection of ``property_type`` and ``suburb``.

Limitations
-----------

The maximum query response size for a table is 50000 documents.
