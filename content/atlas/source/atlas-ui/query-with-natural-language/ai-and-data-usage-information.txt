Querying with natural language in |service-fullname| is powered by Generative AI
(Gen AI), and may give inaccurate responses. See our `Generative AI FAQ 
<https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/faq-ai-features>`__ 
for more information about Gen AI in MongoDB products.

Third Party Providers
---------------------

Querying with natural language in |service| currently uses the 
`Azure OpenAI Service <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__ 
hosted by Microsoft.  This is subject to change in the future. 

How Your Data is Used
---------------------

When you query with natural language in |service|, the query sends the 
following information to MongoDB and/or the third-party AI provider: 

- The full text of your natural language prompt.

- The schema of the collection you are querying, 
  including database name, collection name, field names, and types. 

- Sample field values to improve the quality of recommendations. 

  .. note:: 
   
     You can prevent |service| from sending sample field values in the 
     :ref:`project-level settings <atlas-ui-ai-features-project-level-disable>`. 
     If you disable this setting, you can still use natural language querying, 
     however, responses might be less accurate.

The information that is sent will not be shared with any other third 
parties or stored by the AI provider. We do not send database 
connection strings, credentials, rows, or documents from your databases. 

Disable AI Features
-------------------

You can disable AI-powered features at the project and organization levels. 

.. _atlas-ui-ai-features-project-level-disable:

Don't Share Sample Field Values 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use natural language querying but want to prevent 
|service| from sending sample field values to MongoDB or third-party 
providers, you can opt out from sharing field values within a project. 

.. note:: 

    If you disable this functionality, responses from your natural language 
    queries might be less accurate.

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      To opt out from sharing field values with the {+atlas-admin-api+}, 
      send a ``PATCH`` request to the :oas-atlas-tag:`settings 
      </Projects/operation/updateProjectSettings>` endpoint with the 
      ``isDataExplorerGenAISampleDocumentPassingEnabled`` boolean flag value set 
      to ``false``.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli 

      To opt out from sharing field values with the {+atlas-cli+}, run 
      the following command: 

      .. code-block:: 

         atlas projects settings update --disableDataExplorerGenAISampleDocumentPassing

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui 
      
      .. procedure::
         :style: normal 
         
         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-project-settings.rst
               
         .. step:: Don't share sample field values. 
               
            Set the 
            :guilabel:`Enable Sending Sample Field Values in Data Explorer Generative AI Features` 
            toggle to :guilabel:`off`.

Disable Natural Language Querying 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you no longer want to use natural language querying on your project, you can 
turn this feature off in the project-level settings.

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      To disable natural language querying with the {+atlas-admin-api+}, 
      send a ``PATCH`` request to the :oas-atlas-tag:`settings 
      </Projects/operation/updateProjectSettings>` endpoint with the 
      ``isDataExplorerGenAIFeaturesEnabled`` boolean flag value set to 
      ``false``.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli 

      To disable natural language querying with the {+atlas-cli+}, run the 
      following command: 

      .. code-block:: 

         atlas projects settings update --disableDataExplorerGenAIFeatures

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui 
      
      .. procedure::
         :style: normal 

            
         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-project-settings.rst
               
         .. step:: Disable natural language querying. 
               
            Set the :guilabel:`Enable Data Explorer Generative AI Features`
            toggle to :guilabel:`off`. 
   
Disable All AI Features on |service|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to prevent users in your organization from using all |service| 
features that use generative AI, you can change this setting at the organization
level.

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      To disable AI features for an organization with the {+atlas-admin-api+}, 
      send a ``PATCH`` request to the :oas-atlas-tag:`settings 
      </Organization/operation/updateOrganization>` endpoint with the 
      ``genAIFeaturesEnabled`` boolean flag value set to ``false``.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli 

      To disable AI features for an organization with the {+atlas-cli+}, specify 
      ``genAIFeaturesEnabled: false`` in a JSON configuration file:

      .. code-block:: json

         {
            "genAIFeaturesEnabled": false
         }
      
      After you update the ``genAIFeaturesEnabled`` field in your configuration 
      file, run the following command to update the organization settings: 

      .. code-block:: 

         atlas api updateOrganizationRoles --file <path-to-config-file>

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui 
      
      .. procedure::
         :style: normal 
         
         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-settings.rst
            
         .. step:: Disable the AI feature. 
            
            Set the :guilabel:`Enable Atlas features that use generative AI` 
            toggle to :guilabel:`off`.
