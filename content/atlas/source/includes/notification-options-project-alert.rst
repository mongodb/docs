When you configure an alert, you select how notifications are
sent. You can select multiple notification methods, such as
email, text message, or team collaboration tools.

To use certain notification methods, you must first set up
notification methods in the project's settings.
If the notification method's value becomes invalid, |service|
sends an email to the project owner. The following
notification methods require set up in the project's
settings:

- |service| Project
- |service| Organization
- |service| User
- Email
- SMS
- PagerDuty
- Datadog
- VictorOps
- Opsgenie
- Microsoft Teams
- Webhook
