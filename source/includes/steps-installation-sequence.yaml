  All servers must meet the |onprem| :doc:`Hardware and Software
  Requirements </core/requirements>`.

  Servers that host MongoDB **must** also meet the configuration
  requirements in the :manual:`MongoDB Production Notes

  information on :manual:`ulimits </reference/ulimit>`, :manual:`NUMA
  </administration/production-notes#production-numa>`,
  :manual:`Transparent Huge Pages (THP)
  </reference/transparent-huge-pages>`, and other configuration
  options.
