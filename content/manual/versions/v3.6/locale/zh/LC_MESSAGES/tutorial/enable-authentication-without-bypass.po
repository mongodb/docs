"Enabling authentication on a MongoDB instance restricts access to the "
"instance by requiring that users identify themselves when connecting. In "
"this procedure, you will create the instance's first user, which must be a "
"user administrator and then enable authentication. Then, you can "
"authenticate as the user administrator to create additional users and grant "
"additional access to the instance."

"This document outlines a procedure for enabling authentication for MongoDB "
"instance where you create the first user on an existing MongoDB system that "
"does not require authentication before restarting the instance and requiring"
" authentication. You can use the :ref:`localhost exception <localhost-"
"exception>` to gain access to a system with no users and authentication "
"enabled. See :doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication` for the description of "
