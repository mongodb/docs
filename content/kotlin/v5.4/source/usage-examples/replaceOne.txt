==================
Replace a Document
==================

You can replace a single document using the ``replaceOne()`` method on
a ``MongoCollection`` object. This method removes all the existing fields
and values from a document (except the ``_id`` field) and substitutes it
with your replacement document.

The ``replaceOne()`` method accepts a query filter that matches the
document you want to replace and a replacement document that contains the
data you want to save in place of the matched document. The ``replaceOne()``
method only replaces the first document that matches the filter.

You can optionally pass an instance of ``ReplaceOptions`` to the ``replaceOne()`` method in
order to specify the method's behavior. For example, if you set the ``upsert``
field of the ``ReplaceOptions`` object to ``true``, the operation inserts
a new document from the fields in the replacement document if no documents
match the query filter. See the link to the ``ReplaceOptions`` API
documentation at the bottom of this page for more information.

Upon successful execution, the ``replaceOne()`` method returns an instance
of ``UpdateResult``.  You can retrieve information such as the number of
documents modified by calling the ``getModifiedCount()`` method. You can also
retrieve the value of the document's ``_id`` field by calling the
``getUpsertedId()`` method if you set ``upsert(true)`` in the
``ReplaceOptions`` instance and the operation resulted in the insertion of a new document.

If your replacement operation fails, the driver raises an exception.
For example, if you try to specify a value for the immutable field
``_id`` in your replacement document that differs from the original
document, the method throws a ``MongoWriteException`` with the message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   After applying the update, the (immutable) field '_id' was found to have been altered to _id: ObjectId('...)

If your replacement document contains a change that violates unique index
rules, the method throws a ``MongoWriteException`` with an error
message that should look something like this:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   E11000 duplicate key error collection: ...

For more information on the types of exceptions raised under specific
conditions, see the API documentation for ``replaceOne()``, linked at the
bottom of this page.

Example
-------

In this example, we replace the first match of our query filter in the
``movies`` collection of the ``sample_mflix`` database with a replacement
document. All the fields except for the ``_id`` field are deleted from the
original document and are substituted by the replacement document.

Before the ``replaceOne()`` operation runs, the original document contains
several fields describing the movie. After the operation runs, the resulting
document contains only the fields specified by the replacement document
(``title`` and ``fullplot``) and the ``_id`` field.

The following snippet uses the following objects and methods:

- A **query filter** that is passed to the ``replaceOne()`` method. The ``eq``
  filter matches only movies with the title exactly matching the text
  ``'Music of the Heart'``.

- A **replacement document** that contains the document that replaces the
  matching document if it exists.

- A **ReplaceOptions** object with the ``upsert`` option set to ``true``.
  This option specifies that the method should insert the data contained in
  the replacement document if the query filter does not match any documents.

After you run the example, you should see output that looks something like
this:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Modified document count: 1
   Upserted id: null

Or if the example resulted in an upsert:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Modified document count: 0
   Upserted id: BsonObjectId{value=...}

If you query the replaced document, it should look something like this:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Movie(title=50 Violins, fullplot= A dramatization of the true story of Roberta Guaspari who co-founded the Opus 118 Harlem School of Music)
