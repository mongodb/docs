This page describes common strategies for troubleshooting
:term:`sharded cluster` deployments.

Application Servers or :binary:`~bin.mongos` Instances Become Unavailable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If each application server has its own :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, other
application servers can continue to access the database. Furthermore,
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances do not maintain persistent state, and they
can restart and become unavailable without losing any state or data.
When a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance starts, it retrieves a copy of the
:term:`config database` and can begin routing queries.

A Single :binary:`~bin.mongod` Becomes Unavailable in a Shard
-------------------------------------------------------------

:doc:`Replica sets </replication>` provide high availability for shards.
If the unavailable :binary:`~bin.mongod` is a :term:`primary`, then the
replica set will :ref:`elect <replica-set-elections>` a new primary. If
the unavailable :binary:`~bin.mongod` is a :term:`secondary`, and it
disconnects the primary and secondary will continue to hold all data. In
a three member replica set, even if a single member of the set
experiences catastrophic failure, two other members have full copies of
the data. [#recovery-window]_

Always investigate availability interruptions and failures. If a system
is unrecoverable, replace it and create a new member of the replica set
as soon as possible to replace the lost redundancy.

.. [#recovery-window] If an unavailable secondary becomes available
   while it still has current oplog entries, it can catch up to the
   latest state of the set using the normal :term:`replication process
   <sync>`; otherwise, it must perform an :term:`initial sync`.

All Members of a Shard Become Unavailable
-----------------------------------------

In a sharded cluster, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances
monitor the replica sets in the sharded cluster (e.g. shard replica
sets, config server replica set).

If all members of a replica set shard are unavailable, all data held in
that shard is unavailable. However, the data on all other shards will
remain available, and it is possible to read and write data to the
other shards. However, your application must be able to deal with
partial results, and you should investigate the cause of the
interruption and attempt to recover the shard as soon as possible.

A Config Server Replica Set Member Become Unavailable
-----------------------------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

   .. include:: /includes/fact-mirrored-config-servers-deprecated.rst

:doc:`Replica sets </replication>` provide high availability for the
config servers. If an unavailable config server is a :term:`primary`,
then the replica set will :ref:`elect <replica-set-elections>` a new
primary.

If the replica set config server loses its primary and cannot elect a
primary, the cluster's metadata becomes *read only*. You can still read
and write data from the shards, but no :ref:`chunk migration
<sharding-balancing>` or :doc:`chunk splits
</tutorial/split-chunks-in-sharded-cluster>` will occur until a primary
is available.

.. _sharded-clusters-3.2-config-server-avail:

MongoDB 3.2
~~~~~~~~~~~

In a sharded cluster, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances
monitor the replica sets in the sharded cluster (e.g. shard replica
sets, config server replica set).

If no member of the config server replica set is reachable by a
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance or a shard member:

For MongoDB 3.2.0-3.2.9,
   If the number of consecutive unsuccessful attempts exceeds
   :parameter:`replMonitorMaxFailedChecks` parameter value, the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance denotes the
   replica set as unavailable and the monitoring
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` or :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance becomes unusable
   until you restart the instance.

   However, you can avoid having to restart the :binary:`~bin.mongos` or
   the shard replica set member :binary:`~bin.mongod` in this situation by
   setting :parameter:`replMonitorMaxFailedChecks` to value
   ``2147483647`` when you start up these instances:

   .. important::
      The parameter setting is not persisted upon restart.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { setParameter: 1, 'replMonitorMaxFailedChecks': 2147483647 } )

For MongoDB 3.2.10 or later 3.2-series,
   By default, you do not need to restart unless
   :parameter:`timeOutMonitoringReplicaSets` is set to ``true``.

Cursor Fails Because of Stale Config Data
-----------------------------------------

.. DOCS-425

A query returns the following warning when one or more of the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances has not yet updated its cache of the
cluster's metadata from the :term:`config database`:

.. code-block:: none

   could not initialize cursor across all shards because : stale config detected

This warning *should* not propagate back to your application. The
warning will repeat until all the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances refresh
their caches. To force an instance to refresh its cache, run the
:dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` command.

Shard Keys and Cluster Availability
-----------------------------------

The most important consideration when choosing a :term:`shard key`
are:

- to ensure that MongoDB will be able to distribute data evenly among
  shards, and

- to scale writes across the cluster, and

- to ensure that :binary:`~bin.mongos` can isolate most queries to a specific
  :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

Furthermore:

- Each shard should be a :term:`replica set`, if a specific
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance fails, the replica set members will elect
  another to be :term:`primary` and continue operation. However, if an
  entire shard is unreachable or fails for some reason, that data will
  be unavailable.

- If the shard key allows the :binary:`~bin.mongos` to isolate most
  operations to a single shard, then the failure of a single shard
  will only render *some* data unavailable.

- If your shard key distributes data required for every operation
  throughout the cluster, then the failure of the entire shard will
  render the entire cluster unavailable.

In essence, this concern for reliability simply underscores the
importance of choosing a shard key that isolates query operations to a
single shard.

.. _config-database-string-error:

Config Database String Error
----------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

Starting in MongoDB 3.2, config servers can be deployed as replica
sets. The :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances for the sharded cluster must
specify the same config server replica set name but can specify
hostname and port of different members of the replica set.

.. include:: /includes/3.4-sccc-unsupported.rst

With earlier versions of MongoDB sharded clusters that use the topology
of three mirrored :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances for config servers,
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances in a sharded cluster must specify identical
:setting:`~sharding.configDB` string.


Avoid Downtime when Moving Config Servers
-----------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-use-cnames-for-config-servers.rst

``moveChunk commit failed`` Error
---------------------------------

At the end of a :ref:`chunk migration <sharding-chunk-migration>`, the
:term:`shard` must connect to the :term:`config database` to update the
chunk's record in the cluster metadata. If the :term:`shard` fails to
connect to the :term:`config database`, MongoDB reports the following
error:

.. code-block:: none

   ERROR: moveChunk commit failed: version is at <n>|<nn> instead of
   <N>|<NN>" and "ERROR: TERMINATING"

When this happens, the :term:`primary` member of the shard's replica
set then terminates to protect data consistency. If a :term:`secondary`
member can access the config database, data on the shard becomes
accessible again after an election.

The user will need to resolve the chunk migration failure
independently. If you encounter this issue, contact the `MongoDB
User Group <http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user>`_ or
:doc:`MongoDB Support </support>` to address this issue.
