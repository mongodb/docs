Scatter charts plot data with individual data points placed along the
X and Y axes. Optionally, the data point representations may use shapes
and colors to display additional data dimensions.

Scatter Chart Encoding Channels
-------------------------------

Scatter charts provide the following :ref:`encoding channels
<encoding-channels>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Encoding Channel
     - Description

   * - X / Y Axis
     - The X and Y axis encoding channels accept numerical and date
       fields and display the range of values from the field along the
       corresponding axis.

   * - Size
     - *(Optional)* An :guilabel:`aggregation` encoding channel that
       changes the size of the data point markers, with larger sizes
       indicating larger aggregated values.

   * - Color
     - *(Optional)* A :guilabel:`category` encoding channel that changes
       the color of the data point markers based on the value of the
       selected field. |charts| lists the colors used in a key to the
       right of the chart.

   * - Shape
     - *(Optional)* A :guilabel:`category` encoding channel that changes
       the shape of the data point markers based on the value of the
       selected field. |charts| lists the shapes used in a key to the
       right of the chart.

   * - Tooltip Detail
     - *(Optional)* A :guilabel:`category` encoding channel that adds
       the value of the selected field to each data point's tooltip. To
       view a data point tooltip, hover over that point in the chart.

       In addition to the :guilabel:`Tooltip Detail` field, the tooltip
       also shows other fields used to construct the chart.

Use Cases
---------

Scatter charts are useful for representing numerical data and
showing clearly how data points cluster together in certain areas.
The :guilabel:`Size`, :guilabel:`Color`, and :guilabel:`Shape`
encoding channels allow you to reveal
additional trends for data dimensions with low cardinality.

.. tip::

   A chart with many different colors or shapes may result in a
   cluttered visualization which is difficult to read. You can limit
   the number of categories in your chart by :ref:`binning
   <charts-bin-data>` or :ref:`limiting <charts-limit-data>` your data.

Scatter charts show an individual marker for each data point, so
they work better with smaller result sets. Outliers and extreme data
points are easy to identify.

Consider using a scatter chart to display:

- Temperature data for selected cities
- Volume of sales data for selected retail outlets
- Population density figures across several countries


Limitations
-----------

The maximum query response size for a scatter chart is 50000 documents.  


Examples
--------

AirBnB Rentals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following scatter chart uses a database of information about
AirBnB rental properties in Sydney, Australia. The X axis shows the
review ratings given to individual properties, with the price per
night displayed along the Y axis. The :ref:`query filter
<charts-filter-documents>` restricts the result set to properties with
at least 100 reviews.

The chart shows that lower-priced properties have a wider range of
review scores, while higher-priced properties have a smaller score
range with generally higher scores.

Movies with the Most Award Nominations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following more complex scatter chart uses a database with movie
data compiled from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. The chart shows the
TomatoMeter rating (ranging from 0 to 100) of movies with at least
one award nomination. Each data point marker represents one movie.
The X axis shows the movie's TomatoMeter rating and the Y axis shows
the number of award nominations the movie received.

The :ref:`query filter <charts-filter-documents>` restricts the result
set to exclude marginal data points.

The chart uses the :guilabel:`Color` and :guilabel:`Shape` encoding
channels to shed further light on the types of movies which receive
the most award nominations. The color of each data point shows the
MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) rating the movie received.
The chart uses the Shape encoding channel to indicate the year in
which the movie was released, and :ref:`bins <charts-bin-data>` the
data to place each movie into a time range, with each bin covering
25 years. Without the bins, there would be a different shape for every
year, which would make the chart too noisy to read.
