Migrate or Import Data
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can bring data from existing MongoDB deployments, ``JSON``, or ``CSV``
files into |service| using either live migration tools where |service|
assists you, or tools for a self-guided migration of data into |service|.

.. include:: /includes/serverless-move-data-options.rst

:doc:`migration-to-atlas-choosing`
   Choose between different tools for data import and migration based on
   common cluster configurations.

:doc:`migration-from-com`
   Use the |service|-managed live migration service to push data from a
   live deployment in |com| into |service|. |service| guides you through
   the process and ensures the live migration from |com| to |service|
   proceeds only when you are ready to start the migration.

:doc:`migration-live-atlas-managed`
   Use the |service|-managed tools to pull data into |service|.
   |service| guides you through the process and ensures the migration
   proceeds only when you are ready to start the migration.

:doc:`migration-self-managed`
   Use |mongomirror|, |mongorestore|, |mongoimport|, or
   :compass:`MongoDB Compass </import-export/>`
   to bring data into |service|. With these tools, you manage the migration
   process outside of |service|.
