You can configure {+avs+} to automatically generate and manage vector
embeddings for the text data in your cluster. You can create a
one-click AI semantic search index in your ``M10`` or higher |service|
cluster and use  Voyage AI embedding models, simplifying indexing,
updating, and querying with vectors. 

When you enable Automated Embedding, {+avs+} automatically generates
embeddings using the specified embedding model at index-time for the
specified text field in your |service| collection and at query-time for
your text string in your query against the field indexed for automated
embeddings. 

Considerations 
--------------

.. important:: 

   You can use {+avs+} Automated Embedding on any ``M10`` or higher
   cluster on any cloud provider. However, the service that handles the
   inference process for generating vector embeddings runs on |gcp|. This
   means that your data is sent to |gcp| for embedding generation and
   retrieval, regardless of your cluster's cloud provider. We provide
   enterprise grade security and therefore, your data is only stored
   in your cluster. 

The embedding models run on a shared, multi-tenant inference platform.
Therefore, during the preview period, you must use datasets with less
than 100k document and run queries only for the evaluation of the
feature and not for load testing. Contact your account team if you have
a use case with higher limits.

Although there are no hard rate-limits for your workload, there are
global limits. If your queries return a rate limit error (error 409),
perform a backoff and retry in your application code. This allows your 
application to gracefully handle rate limits and ensures continued
functionality. 

Prerequisites 
-------------

To enable vector search using Automated Embedding, you must have the
following: 

- ``M10`` or higher cluster 
- A collection with a text field that you want to index for automated
  embeddings. 
- One of the following clients:

  - {+atlas-ui+} for creating indexes 
  - {+mongosh+} for creating indexes and running queries
  - :driver:`Node Driver </node/current/>` 6.6.0 or higher for creating indexes and running queries
  - :driver:`Python Driver </python-drivers/>` 4.7 or higher for creating indexes and running queries

  Use the following drop-down menu to set the client for the procedures on this page.

{+avs+} Index for Automated Embedding
----------------------------------------------------

The following sections describe the {+avs+} index syntax and fields for
enabling automatic generation of embeddings for text fields and walk you
through the steps for configuring your index for Automated Embedding.

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need the :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` or higher role to create
and manage {+avs+} indexes.

Index Syntax 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is the syntax for enabling automatic generation of
embeddings:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

   {
     "fields": [
       {
         "type": "text",
         "path": "<field-name>",
         "model": "voyage-3-large | voyage-3.5 | voyage-3.5-lite"
       }
     ]
   }

Index Fields 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following fields are required in the index definition:

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 15 15 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``type``
     - string
     - The type of the field. For Automated Embedding, this must be
       ``text``.

   * - ``path``
     - string
     - The name of the field in the collection that you want to index
       for Automated Embedding.

   * - ``model``
     - string
     - The Voyage AI embedding model to use for generating the embeddings
       for the index. You can specify one of the following models:
       
       - ``voyage-3-large`` - Highest-quality retrieval across languages
         and domains. 
       - ``voyage-3.5`` - Balanced model for multilingual use and
         general-purpose retrieval accuracy. 
       - ``voyage-3.5-lite`` - Lightweight, faster model optimized for
         latency and lower cost. 

       After creating the index, if you change the embedding model
       subsequently, {+avs+} generates new embeddings for the dataset.
       While {+avs+} generates the embeddings, you can continue to
       query by using the old embeddings. When the old embeddings are
       replaced with embeddings from the new embedding model, {+avs+}
       removes the old embeddings.

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The index fields for Automated Embedding are mutually exclusive with the
following ``vector`` type index fields: 

- ``numDimensions``
- ``similarity``
- ``quantization``

If your collection already has embeddings, you must use the ``vector``
type fields to index the embeddings. To learn more about indexing fields
with embeddings, see :ref:`avs-types-vector-search`. 

You can create an index with both the ``text`` and ``vector`` types if
you want to index a text field for automatically generating embeddings
and also index a field with your own embeddings. {+avs+} will
automatically generate embeddings for queries against only the field
indexed as the ``text`` type. You must specify embeddings in the query
for searching the field indexed as the ``vector`` type.

You can also index fields to pre-filter your data by using the {+avs+}
``filter`` type. Pre-filtering reduces the number of documents against
which to run similarity comparisons, which can decrease query latency
and increase the accuracy of search results. To learn more about
pre-filtering your data, see :ref:`avs-types-filter`. 

Create an Index for Automated Embedding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |database-name| replace:: ``sample_mflix``
.. |collection-name| replace:: ``movies``
.. |index-name| replace:: ``movies_automated_embeddings``

The following procedure walks through the steps for enabling automated
embeddings in your {+avs+} index. If you loaded the
``sample_mflix.movies`` dataset, the example in the procedure
demonstrates how to enable Automated Embedding for the ``fullplot``
field in the collection.

{+avs+} Query with Automated Embedding
-----------------------------------------------------

After you create an index with Automated Embedding, you can run text
queries against the indexed field. {+avs+} automatically generates
embeddings for the text string in your query using the same embedding
model specified in the index. It uses the embeddings to search the index
for documents that are semantically similar to the specified query text.

The following sections describe the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` pipeline
syntax and fields for automatically generating embeddings for your query
text against the field indexed for Automated Embedding and demonstrate
how to run semantic search queries against the fields indexed for
Automated Embedding.  

Query Syntax 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following syntax demonstrates how to run a query against a field
indexed for Automated Embedding: 

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

   {
     "$vectorSearch": {
       "index": "<index-name>",
       "limit": <number-of-results>,
       "numCandidates": <number-of-candidates>,
       "path": "<field-to-search>",
       "query": "<query-string>"
     }
   }

Query Fields 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following fields are required for a {+avs+} query using automated
embeddings: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 15 15 70

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description

   * - ``exact``
     - boolean
     - Conditional 
     - This field is required if ``numCandidates`` is omitted. Mutually
       exclusive with ``numCandidates``. 
      
       Flag that specifies whether to run |enn| or |ann| search. Value
       can be one of the following: 
 
       - ``false`` - to run |ann| search

       Mutually exclusive with ``exact``. 
       
       Number of nearest neighbors to use during the search. Value must 
       be less than or equal to (``<=``) ``10000``. You can't specify a
       number less than the number of documents to return (``limit``).

   * - ``path``
     - string 
     - Required 
     - Indexed :ref:`vector <avs-types-vector>` type field to search.

   * - ``query``
     - string 
     - Required 
     - Text for which to automatically generate embeddings and perform
       the semantic search.

Considerations  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run an |ann| or |enn| query against the indexed field. To learn
more, see :ref:`ANN Search <vectorSearch-ann>` and :ref:`ENN Search
<vectorSearch-enn>`. 

You can't specify vector embeddings in your query against fields indexed
for Automated Embedding. Instead, you must run a natural language query 
against the field. When you run a natural language query against the
field indexed for Automated Embedding, {+avs+} automatically generates
the embeddings for the query text using the same embedding model as the
indexed field. It then uses the generated embeddings to perform a
semantic search against the indexed field.

You can optionally specify ``filter`` fields in your query to pre-filter
the documents against which {+avs+} performs the semantic search. To learn
more, see :ref:`vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-filter`.

You can also optionally retrieve the score of the documents in the
results. To learn more, see :ref:`vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-score`.

Run a Query Using Automated Embedding 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-drivers::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: atlas-ui

      You can't run {+avs+} queries in the {+atlas-ui+}. Use the
      {+mongosh+} or a supported driver to run queries.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: shell

      .. procedure:: 
         :style: normal 

         .. step:: Connect to the Atlas cluster using {+mongosh+}. 

            To learn more, see :ref:`connect-mongo-shell`.

         .. step:: Switch to the database that contains the collection for which you want to run the query. 

            .. code-block:: javascript 

               use <database-name>

            .. example:: 

               For example, to switch to the ``sample_mflix`` database,
               run the following command in your terminal:

               .. code-block:: javascript 

                  use sample_mflix

         .. step:: Run the ``db.collection.aggregate()`` method with the ``$vectorSearch`` stage.

            The :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method has the
            following syntax:

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/avs/automated-embeddings/basic-query-syntax.sh
               :language: javascript 
               :linenos:

            .. example:: 

               For example, to run a query against the ``fullplot``
               field in the ``movies`` collection for a semantic search
               for movies semantically similar to ``young heroes caught
               in epic struggles between light and darkness``, copy,
               paste, and run the following query.

               .. io-code-block:: 
                  :copyable: true

The Mages - an elite group of magic-users - rule whilst the lowly commoners are powerless. Izmer's young Empress, Savina, wants equality and prosperity for all, but the evil Mage Profion is plotting to depose her and establish his own rule. The Empress possesses a scepter which controls Izmer's Golden Dragons. To challenge her rule, Profion must have the scepter, and tricks the Council of Mages into believing Savina is unfit to hold it. Knowing that Profion will bring death and destruction to Izmer, Savina must find the legendary Rod of Savrille, a mythical rod that has the power to control Red Dragons, a species even mightier than the Gold. Enter two thieves, Ridley and Snails, who unwittingly become instrumental in Savina's search for the Rod. Joined by a feisty Dwarf named Elwood, and helped by the Empress's expert tracker, the Elf Norda, the young heroes go in search of the Rod of Savrille. From the deadly maze of the Thieves Guild at Antius to an Elven Village, secret grotto and abandoned castles, Ridley and his band must outwit Profion's chief henchman Damodar at every turn while, back in Izmer, Profion prepares to do battle with the Empress.
