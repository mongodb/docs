You can use the ``scoreDetails`` boolean option in your
:pipeline:`$search` stage for a detailed breakdown of the score for 
each document in the query results. To view the metadata, you must use
the :manual:`$meta </reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` expression
in the :pipeline:`$project` stage.

Syntax 
------

.. code-block:: json 
   :emphasize-lines: 6,11

   {
     "$search": {
       "<operator>": {
         <operator-specification>
       },
       "scoreDetails": true | false
     }
   },
   {
     "$project": {
       "scoreDetails": {"$meta": "searchScoreDetails"}
     }
   }

.. _fts-score-details-options:

Options 
-------

*In the $search stage*, the ``scoreDetails`` boolean option
takes one of the following values:  

- ``true`` - to include details of the score for the documents in the
  results. If set to ``true``, |fts| returns a detailed breakdown of
  the score for each document in the result. To learn more, see
  :ref:`fts-score-details-output`. 
- ``false`` - to exclude details of the score breakdown for the results.
  (Default) 

If omitted, the ``scoreDetails`` option defaults to ``false``.

*In the $project stage*, the ``scoreDetails`` field takes
the :manual:`$meta </reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` expression,
which requires the following value: 

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 30 70

   * - ``searchScoreDetails``
     - Returns a detailed breakdown of the score for each document in
       the results.

.. _fts-score-details-output:

Output 
------

The ``scoreDetails`` option returns the following fields in the
``details`` array inside the ``scoreDetails`` object for each document
in the result:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 10 75

   * - Field  
     - Type 
     - Description 
     
   * - ``value``
     - float
     - Contribution towards the score by a subset of the scoring
       formula. The top-level ``value`` shows the entire score of the result
       document, and is equal to the value of ``$searchScore``.
       
       The scoring formula varies based on the operator used in
       the query. For example, |fts| uses the following scoring formula
       for a :ref:`compound-ref` query with :ref:`text-ref` and 
       :ref:`near-ref` operators:  ``BM25Similarity +
       distance decay function``. 
          

   * - ``description``
     - string
     - Subset of the scoring formula including details about how the
       document was scored and factors considered in calculating
       the score. The top-level ``description`` shows the entire scoring formula 
       used to score the document. 

       To learn more, see :ref:`fts-score-details-factors`.

   * - ``details``
     - array of objects 
     - Breakdown of the score for each match in the document based on
       the subset of the scoring formula. The value is an array of
       score details objects, recursive in structure.

.. _fts-score-details-factors:

Factors That Contribute to the Score 
------------------------------------

For ``BM25Similarity``, the score is computed as ``boost * idf * tf``.
|fts| takes into account the following ``BM25Similarity`` factors for
calculating the score: 

.. include:: /includes/fts/list-tables/list-table-fts-bm25similarity.rst

For distance decay function, the score is computed as ``pivot / (pivot +
abs(fieldValue - origin))``. |fts| takes into account the following
factors for calculating the score: 

.. include:: /includes/fts/list-tables/list-table-fts-distance-decay-function.rst 

.. _fts-score-details-egs:

Examples 
--------

The following examples show how to retrieve the details of the scores
in the results for the following:

- Queries run using :ref:`text-ref`, :ref:`near-ref`,
  :ref:`compound-ref`, and :ref:`embedded-document-ref` operators. 
- Queries with scores modified using :ref:`scoring-function` option
  expressions. 

.. tip:: 

   To view details of the score recursively in the arrays of objects,
   configure the settings in {+mongosh+} by running the following:

   .. code-block:: shell 
      :copyable: true 

      config.set('inspectDepth', Infinity)

Operator Examples 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following examples demonstrate how to retrieve a breakdown of the
score using the :pipeline:`$search` ``scoreDetails`` option for the
documents in the results for the :ref:`text-ref`, :ref:`near-ref`,
:ref:`compound-ref`, and :ref:`embedded-document-ref` operator queries. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: text
      :tabid: text

      The following example uses the :ref:`text-ref` operator to query
      the ``title`` field in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection for
      the term ``autumn``. The query  specifies the ``scoreDetails``
      option in the :pipeline:`$search` stage to retrieve a detailed
      breakdown of the score for each document in the results. The query
      uses the :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the results to three
      documents and the :pipeline:`$project` stage to do the following: 

      - Exclude the ``_id`` field.
      - Include only the ``title`` field.
      - Add the ``score`` field to the results to return the score of the
        document and the ``scoreDetails`` field to the results to return a
        detailed breakdown of the score for the document.

      |fts| takes into account the following ``BM25Similarity`` factors
      for calculating the score: 

      .. include:: /includes/fts/list-tables/list-table-fts-bm25similarity.rst

   .. tab:: near
      :tabid: near

      The following example uses the :ref:`near-ref` operator to query
      the ``released`` field in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
      for movies released near January 01, 2010. The query specifies the
      ``scoreDetails`` option in the :pipeline:`$search` stage to
      retrieve a detailed breakdown of the score for each document in
      the results. The query uses the :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit
      the results to three documents and the :pipeline:`$project` stage
      to do the following: 

      - Exclude the ``_id`` field.
      - Include only the ``title`` and ``released`` fields.
      - Add the ``score`` field to the results to return the score of the
        document and the ``scoreDetails`` field to the results to return a
        detailed breakdown of the score for the document.

      For distance score, |fts| takes into account the following factors

      .. include:: /includes/fts/list-tables/list-table-fts-distance-decay-function.rst 

   .. tab:: compound
      :tabid: compound

      The following example uses the :ref:`compound-ref` operator to
      query the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection for movies using the
      following clauses: 
      
      - ``filter`` clause to find movies that contain the term
        ``friend`` in the title.
      - ``must`` clause to find movies released between the years
        ``2000`` and ``2015``. 
      - ``mustNot`` clause to find movies that are not in the
        ``Short``, ``Western``, and ``Biography`` genres. 
        
      The query specifies the ``scoreDetails`` option in the
      :pipeline:`$search` stage to retrieve a detailed breakdown of the
      score for each document in the results. The query uses the
      :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the results to three documents
      and the :pipeline:`$project` stage to do the following: 

      - Exclude the ``_id`` field.
      - Include only the ``title``, ``released``, and ``genres`` fields.
      - Add the ``score`` field to the results to return the score of the
        document and the ``scoreDetails`` field to the results to return a
        detailed breakdown of the score for the document.

      .. note:: 

         The ``# clause`` in the results on lines 15, 56, and 97
         represent the :ref:`compound-ref` query ``filter`` clause,
         which doesn't contribute to the score of the document.

   .. tab:: embeddedDocument
      :tabid: embedded

      The following example uses the :ref:`embedded-document-ref`
      operator to query the ``products.name`` field in the
      ``sample_training.companies`` collection for products that contain
      the term ``Basic`` preceded by any number of other characters. The
      query specifies inside the ``embeddedDocument`` operator that the
      returned score must be a sum of all the matching embedded
      documents. The query also specifies the ``scoreDetails`` option in
      the :pipeline:`$search` stage to retrieve a detailed breakdown of
      the score for each document in the results. The query uses the
      :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the results to three documents
      and the :pipeline:`$project` stage to do the following:

      - Exclude the ``_id`` field.
      - Include only the ``products.name`` field.
      - Add the ``score`` field to the results to return the score of the
        document and the ``scoreDetails`` field to the results to return a
        detailed breakdown of the score for the document.

         For scores based on child documents in range, the numbers in

         indexed by Lucene under the hood. The ``description`` in the
         child documents (on lines 16, 36, and 57) show an internal
         representation of a path.
