Overview
--------

As part of normal operation, MongoDB maintains a running log of events,
including entries such as incoming connections, commands run, and issues
encountered. Generally, log messages are useful for diagnosing issues,
monitoring your deployment, and tuning performance.

To get your log messages, you can use any of the 
following methods:

- View logs in your configured :ref:`log destination
  <log-message-destinations>`.
- Run the :dbcommand:`getLog` command.
- Download logs through :atlas:`{+atlas+} </>`.
  To learn more, see :ref:`log-messages-atlas`.

Structured Logging
------------------

:binary:`~bin.mongod` / :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances output all log messages 
in :ref:`structured JSON format <log-message-json-output-format>`. Log entries 
are written as a series of key-value pairs, where each key indicates a log 
message field type, such as "severity", and each corresponding value records 
the associated logging information for that field type, such as "informational".
Previously, log entries were output as plaintext.

.. example::

   The following is an example log message in JSON format as it would
   appear in the MongoDB log file:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-01T15:16:17.180+00:00"},"s":"I", "c":"NETWORK", "id":12345, "ctx":"listener", "svc": "R", "msg":"Listening on", "attr":{"address":"127.0.0.1"}}

   JSON log entries can be :ref:`pretty-printed
   <log-message-pretty-printing>` for readability. Here is the same log
   entry pretty-printed:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      {
        "t": {
          "$date": "2020-05-01T15:16:17.180+00:00"
        },
        "s": "I",
        "c": "NETWORK",
        "id": 12345,
        "ctx": "listener",
        "svc": "R",
        "msg": "Listening on",
        "attr": {
          "address": "127.0.0.1"
        }
      }

   In this log entry, for example, the key ``s``, representing
   :ref:`severity <log-severity-levels>`, has a corresponding value of
   ``I``, representing "Informational", and the key ``c``, representing
   :ref:`component <log-message-components>`, has a corresponding value
   of ``NETWORK``, indicating that the "network" component was
   responsible for this particular message. The various field types are
   presented in detail in the :ref:`log-message-field-types` section.

Structured logging with key-value pairs allows for efficient parsing
by automated tools or log ingestion services, and makes programmatic
search and analysis of log messages easier to perform. Examples of
analyzing structured log messages can be found in the
:ref:`log-message-parsing` section.

.. note:: 

   The ``mongod`` quits if it's unable to write to the log file. To
   ensure that ``mongod`` can write to the log file, verify that the log
   volume has space on the disk and the logs are rotated. 

.. _log-message-json-output-format:

JSON Log Output Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All log output is in JSON format including output sent to:

- Log file
- Syslog
- Stdout (standard out) :ref:`log destinations
  <log-message-destinations>`

Output from the :dbcommand:`getLog` command is also in JSON format.

Each log entry is output as a self-contained JSON object which follows
the :ref:`Relaxed Extended JSON v2.0 <mongodb-extended-json-v2>`
specification, and has the following layout and field order:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
     "t": <Datetime>, // timestamp
     "s": <String>, // severity
     "c": <String>, // component
     "id": <Integer>, // unique identifier
     "ctx": <String>, // context
     "svc": <String>, // service
     "msg": <String>, // message body
     "attr": <Object>, // additional attributes (optional)
     "tags": <Array of strings>, // tags (optional)
     "truncated": <Object>, // truncation info (if truncated)
     "size": <Object> // original size of entry (if truncated)
   }

Field descriptions:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10 50

   * - Field Name
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``t``
     - Datetime
     - Timestamp of the log message in ISO-8601 format. For an example,
       see :ref:`log-message-timestamp`.

   * - ``s``
     - String
     - Short severity code of the log message. For an example, see
       :ref:`log-severity-levels`.

   * - ``c``
     - String
     - Full component string for the log message. For an example, see
       :ref:`log-message-components`.

   * - ``id``
     - Integer
     - Unique identifier for the log statement. For an example, see
       :ref:`log-message-parsing-example-filter-id`.

   * - ``ctx``
     - String
     - Name of the thread that caused the log statement.

   * - ``svc``
     - String
     - Name of the service in whose context the log statement was made. Will be 
       ``S`` for "shard", ``R`` "router", or ``-`` for "unknown" or "none".

   * - ``msg``
     - String
     - Log output message passed from the server or driver. If
       necessary, the message is :ref:`escaped
       <log-message-json-escaping>` according to the JSON specification.

   * - ``attr``
     - Object
     - | One or more key-value pairs for additional log attributes. If a
       | log message does not include any additional attributes, the
       | ``attr`` object is omitted.
       
       | Attribute values may be referenced by their key name in the
       | ``msg`` message body, depending on the message. If necessary, the
       | attributes are :ref:`escaped <log-message-json-escaping>`
       | according to the JSON specification.

   * - ``tags``
     - Array of strings
     - Strings representing any tags applicable to the log statement.
       For example, ``["startupWarnings"]``.

   * - ``truncated``
     - Object
     - Information about the :ref:`log message truncation
       <log-message-truncation>`, if applicable. Only included if the
       log entry contains at least one truncated ``attr`` attribute.

   * - ``size``
     - Object
     - Original size of a log entry if it has been :ref:`truncated
       <log-message-truncation>`. Only included if the log entry
       contains at least one truncated ``attr`` attribute.

.. _log-message-json-escaping:

Escaping
````````

The **message** and **attributes** fields will escape control
characters as necessary according to the
Relaxed Extended JSON v2.0 specification:

.. include:: /includes/fact-json-escape-sequences.rst

An example of message escaping is provided in the
:ref:`examples section <log-message-json-examples>`.

.. _log-message-truncation:

Truncation
``````````

.. versionchanged:: 7.3

Any **attributes** that exceed the maximum size defined with
:parameter:`maxLogSizeKB` (default: 10 KB) are truncated. Truncated
attributes omit log data beyond the configured limit, but retain the
JSON formatting of the entry to ensure that the entry remains parsable.

For example, the following JSON object represents a ``command`` attribute
that contains 5000 elements in the ``$in`` field without truncation.

.. note:: 

   The example log entries are reformatted for readability.

.. code-block:: javascript 
   :emphasize-lines: 6
   :copyable: false 
   
   { 
     "command": { 
       "find": "mycoll", 
       "filter": { 
         "value1": {
           "$in": [0, 1, 2, 3, ... 4999]
         },
         "value2": "foo"
		 },
		 "sort": { "value1": 1 },
		 "lsid":{"id":{"$uuid":"80a99e49-a850-467b-a26d-aeb2d8b9f42b"}},
		 "$db": "testdb"
	   }
   }

In this example, the ``$in`` array is truncated at the 376th element because the  
size of the ``command`` attribute would exceed :parameter:`maxLogSizeKB` if 
it included the subsequent elements. The remainder of the ``command`` 
attribute is omitted. The truncated log entry resembles the following output: 

.. code-block:: javascript 
   :copyable: false 
   
   {
     "t": { "$date": "2021-03-17T20:30:07.212+01:00" },
     "s": "I",
     "c": "COMMAND",
     "id": 51803,
     "ctx": "conn9",
     "msg": "Slow query",
     "attr": {
       "command": {
         "find": "mycoll",
         "filter": {
           "value1": {
             "$in": [ 0, 1, ..., 376 ] // Values in array omitted for brevity
           }
         }
       },
       ... // Other attr fields omitted for brevity
     },
     "truncated": {
       "command": {
         "truncated": {
           "filter": {
             "truncated": {
               "value1": {
                 "truncated": {
                   "$in": {
                     "truncated": {
                       "377": {
                         "type": "double",
                         "size": 8
                       }
                     },
                     "omitted": 4623
                   }
                 }
               }
             },
             "omitted": 1
           }
         },
         "omitted": 3
       }
     },
     "size": {
       "command": 21692
     }
   }

Log entries containing one or more truncated attributes include nested
``truncated`` objects, which provide the following information for each
truncated attribute in the log entry:

- The attribute that was truncated
- The specific sub-object of that attribute that triggered truncation, if
  applicable
- The data ``type`` of the truncated field
- The ``size``, in bytes, of the element that triggers truncation
- The number of elements that were ``omitted`` under each sub-object due to 
  truncation

Log entries with truncated attributes may also include an additional
``size`` field at the end of the entry which indicates the original
size of the attribute before truncation, in this case ``21692`` or about
22KB. This final ``size`` field is only shown if it is different from
the ``size`` field in the ``truncated`` object, i.e. if the total object
size of the attribute is different from the size of the truncated
sub-object, as is the case in the example above.

Padding
```````

When output to the *file* or the *syslog* log destinations, padding is
added after the **severity**, **context**, and **id** fields to increase
readability when viewed with a fixed-width font.

The following MongoDB log file excerpt demonstrates this padding:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:12.724+00:00"},"s":"I", "c":"CONTROL", "id":23285, "ctx":"main", "svc": "R", "msg":"Automatically disabling TLS 1.0, to force-enable TLS 1.0 specify --sslDisabledProtocols 'none'"}
   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:12.734+00:00"},"s":"W", "c":"ASIO", "id":22601, "ctx":"main", "svc": "R", "msg":"No TransportLayer configured during NetworkInterface startup"}
   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:12.734+00:00"},"s":"I", "c":"NETWORK", "id":4648601, "ctx":"main", "svc": "R", "msg":"Implicit TCP FastOpen unavailable. If TCP FastOpen is required, set tcpFastOpenServer, tcpFastOpenClient, and tcpFastOpenQueueSize."}
   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:12.814+00:00"},"s":"I", "c":"STORAGE", "id":4615611, "ctx":"initandlisten", "svc": "R", "msg":"MongoDB starting", "attr":{"pid":10111,"port":27001,"dbPath":"/var/lib/mongo","architecture":"64-bit","host":"centos8"}}
   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:12.814+00:00"},"s":"I", "c":"CONTROL", "id":23403, "ctx":"initandlisten", "svc": "R", "msg":"Build Info", "attr":{"buildInfo":{"version":"4.4.0","gitVersion":"328c35e4b883540675fb4b626c53a08f74e43cf0","openSSLVersion":"OpenSSL 1.1.1c FIPS  28 May 2019","modules":[],"allocator":"tcmalloc","environment":{"distmod":"rhel80","distarch":"x86_64","target_arch":"x86_64"}}}}
   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-18T20:18:12.814+00:00"},"s":"I", "c":"CONTROL", "id":51765, "ctx":"initandlisten", "svc": "R", "msg":"Operating System", "attr":{"os":{"name":"CentOS Linux release 8.0.1905 (Core) ","version":"Kernel 4.18.0-80.11.2.el8_0.x86_64"}}}

.. _log-message-pretty-printing:

Pretty Printing
```````````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-use-jq-with-structured-logging.rst

You can use ``jq`` to pretty-print log entries as follows:

- Pretty-print the entire log file:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     cat mongod.log | jq

- Pretty-print the most recent log entry:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     cat mongod.log | tail -1 | jq

More examples of working with MongoDB structured logs are available in
the :ref:`log-message-parsing` section.

.. _log-message-destinations:

Configuring Log Message Destinations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB log messages can be output to *file*, *syslog*, or *stdout*
(standard output).

To configure the log output destination, use one of the following
settings, either in the :ref:`configuration file
<configuration-options>` or on the command-line:

**Configuration file:**
  - The :setting:`systemLog.destination` option for *file* or *syslog*

**Command-line:**
  - the :option:`--logpath <mongod --logpath>` option for
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` for *file*
  - the :option:`--syslog <mongod --syslog>` option for
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` for *syslog*
  - the :option:`--logpath <mongos --logpath>` option for
    :binary:`~bin.mongos` for *file*
  - the :option:`--syslog <mongos --syslog>` option for
    :binary:`~bin.mongos` for *syslog*

Not specifying either *file* or *syslog* sends all logging output to
*stdout*.

For the full list of logging settings and options see:

**Configuration file:**
  - :ref:`systemLog options list <systemlog-options>`

**Command-line:**
  - :ref:`Log options list <mongod-log-options-section>` for
    :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  - :ref:`Log options list <mongos-log-options-section>` for
    :binary:`~bin.mongos`

.. note::

   Error messages sent to ``stderr`` (standard error), such as fatal
   errors during startup when not using the *file* or *syslog* log
   destinations, or messages having to do with misconfigured logging
   settings, are not affected by the log output destination setting, and
   are printed to ``stderr`` in plaintext format.

.. _log-message-field-types:

Log Message Field Types
-----------------------

.. _log-message-timestamp:

Timestamp
~~~~~~~~~

The timestamp field type indicates the precise date and time at which
the logged event occurred.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 2-4

   {
     "t": {
       "$date": "2020-05-01T15:16:17.180+00:00"
     },
     "s": "I",
     "c": "NETWORK",
     "id": 12345,
     "ctx": "listener",
     "svc": "R", 
     "msg": "Listening on",
     "attr": {
       "address": "127.0.0.1"
     }
   }

When logging to *file* or to *syslog* [#syslog-ts]_, the default
format for the timestamp is ``iso8601-local``. To modify the
timestamp format, use the :option:`--timeStampFormat <mongod
--timeStampFormat>` runtime option or the
:setting:`systemLog.timeStampFormat` setting.

See :ref:`log-message-parsing-example-filter-timestamp` for log parsing
examples that filter on the timestamp field.

.. note::

   The ``ctime`` timestamp format is no longer supported.

.. [#syslog-ts]

   If logging to *syslog*, the ``syslog`` daemon generates timestamps
   when it logs a message, not when MongoDB issues the message. This
   can lead to misleading timestamps for log entries, especially when
   the system is under heavy load.

.. _log-severity-levels:

Severity
~~~~~~~~

The severity field type indicates the severity level associated with the
logged event.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 5

   {
     "t": {
       "$date": "2020-05-01T15:16:17.180+00:00"
     },
     "s": "I",
     "c": "NETWORK",
     "id": 12345,
     "ctx": "listener",
     "svc": "R", 
     "msg": "Listening on",
     "attr": {
       "address": "127.0.0.1"
     }
   }

Severity levels range from "Fatal" (most severe) to "Debug" (least
severe):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Level
     - Description

   * - ``F``
     - Fatal

   * - ``E``
     - Error

   * - ``W``
     - Warning

   * - ``I``
     - Informational, for :ref:`verbosity level
       <log-messages-configure-verbosity>` ``0``

   * - ``D1`` - ``D5``
     - Debug, for :ref:`verbosity levels
       <log-messages-configure-verbosity>` > ``0``

       MongoDB indicates the specific
       :ref:`debug verbosity level <log-messages-configure-verbosity>`.
       For example, if verbosity level is 2, MongoDB indicates ``D2``.

       In previous versions, MongoDB log messages specified ``D``
       for all debug verbosity levels.

You can specify the verbosity level of various components to determine
the amount of **Informational** and **Debug** messages MongoDB outputs.
Severity categories above these levels are always shown. [#slow-oplogs]_
To set verbosity levels, see :ref:`log-messages-configure-verbosity`.

.. _log-message-components:

Components
~~~~~~~~~~

The component field type indicates the category a logged event is a
member of, such as **NETWORK** or **COMMAND**.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   {
     "t": {
       "$date": "2020-05-01T15:16:17.180+00:00"
     },
     "s": "I",
     "c": "NETWORK",
     "id": 12345,
     "ctx": "listener",
     "svc": "R", 
     "msg": "Listening on",
     "attr": {
       "address": "127.0.0.1"
     }
   }

Each component is individually configurable via its own
:ref:`verbosity filter <log-messages-configure-verbosity>`. The
available components are as follows:

.. data:: ACCESS

   Messages related to access control, such as authentication. To
   specify the log level for :data:`ACCESS` components, use the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.accessControl.verbosity` setting.

.. data:: COMMAND

   Messages related to :ref:`database commands <database-commands>`,
   such as :dbcommand:`count`. To specify the log level for
   :data:`COMMAND` components, use the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.command.verbosity` setting.

.. data:: CONTROL

   Messages related to control activities, such as initialization. To
   specify the log level for :data:`CONTROL` components, use the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.control.verbosity` setting.

.. data:: ELECTION

   Messages related specifically to replica set elections. To specify
   the log level for :data:`ELECTION` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.election.verbosity`
   parameter.

   :data:`REPL` is the parent component of :data:`ELECTION`. If
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.election.verbosity` is
   unset, MongoDB uses the :data:`REPL` verbosity level for
   :data:`ELECTION` components.

.. data:: FTDC
   
   Messages related to the diagnostic data collection mechanism, such 
   as server statistics and status messages. To specify the log level
   for :data:`FTDC` components, use the 
   :setting:`systemLog.component.ftdc.verbosity` setting.

.. data:: GEO

   Messages related to the parsing of geospatial shapes, such as
   verifying the GeoJSON shapes. To specify the log level for
   :data:`GEO` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.geo.verbosity` parameter.

.. data:: INDEX

   Messages related to indexing operations, such as
   creating indexes. To specify the log level for
   :data:`INDEX` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.index.verbosity` parameter.

.. data:: INITSYNC

   Messages related to initial sync operation. To specify the log level
   for :data:`INITSYNC` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.initialSync.verbosity`
   parameter.

   :data:`REPL` is the parent component of :data:`INITSYNC`. If
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.initialSync.verbosity` is
   unset, MongoDB uses the :data:`REPL` verbosity level for
   :data:`INITSYNC` components.

.. data:: JOURNAL

   Messages related specifically to storage journaling activities. To
   specify the log level for :data:`JOURNAL` components, use the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.storage.journal.verbosity` setting.

   :data:`STORAGE` is the parent component of :data:`JOURNAL`. If
   :setting:`systemLog.component.storage.journal.verbosity` is
   unset, MongoDB uses the :data:`STORAGE` verbosity level for
   :data:`JOURNAL` components.

.. data:: NETWORK

   Messages related to network activities, such as accepting
   connections. To specify the log level for :data:`NETWORK`
   components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.network.verbosity` parameter.

.. data:: QUERY

   Messages related to queries, including query planner activities.
   To specify the log level for :data:`QUERY` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.query.verbosity` parameter.

.. data:: QUERYSTATS

   Messages related to :pipeline:`$queryStats` operations. To specify the log 
   level for ``QUERYSTATS`` components, set the 
   :setting:`systemLog.component.queryStats.verbosity` parameter.

.. data:: RECOVERY

   Messages related to storage recovery activities. To specify the log
   level for :data:`RECOVERY` components, use the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.storage.recovery.verbosity` setting.

   :data:`STORAGE` is the parent component of :data:`RECOVERY`. If
   :setting:`systemLog.component.storage.recovery.verbosity` is
   unset, MongoDB uses the :data:`STORAGE` verbosity level for
   :data:`RECOVERY` components.

.. data:: REPL

   Messages related to replica sets, such as initial sync, heartbeats,
   steady state replication, and rollback. [#slow-oplogs]_ To specify
   the log level for :data:`REPL` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.verbosity` parameter.

   :data:`REPL` is the parent component of the :data:`ELECTION`,
   :data:`INITSYNC`, :data:`REPL_HB`, and :data:`ROLLBACK` components.

.. data:: REPL_HB

   Messages related specifically to replica set heartbeats. To specify
   the log level for :data:`REPL_HB` components, set the
   :setting:`systemLog.component.replication.heartbeats.verbosity`
   parameter.

   :data:`REPL` is the parent component of :data:`REPL_HB`. If

   both named and unnamed components.

See :ref:`log-message-parsing-example-filter-component` for log parsing
examples that filter on the component field.

.. _log-messages-client-data:

Client Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

:driver:`MongoDB Drivers </>` and client applications (including 
:binary:`~bin.mongosh`) have the ability to send identifying information at the 
time of connection to the server. After the connection is established, the 
client does not send the identifying information again unless the connection is 
dropped and reestablished.

This identifying information is contained in the **attributes**
field of the log entry. The exact information included varies by client. 

Below is a sample log message containing the client data document as
transmitted from a :binary:`~bin.mongosh` connection. The client
data is contained in the ``doc`` object in the **attributes** field:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-20T16:21:31.561+00:00"},"s":"I", "c":"NETWORK", "id":51800, "ctx":"conn202", "svc": "R", "msg":"client metadata", "attr":{"remote":"127.0.0.1:37106","client":"conn202","doc":{"application":{"name":"MongoDB Shell"},"driver":{"name":"MongoDB Internal Client","version":"4.4.0"},"os":{"type":"Linux","name":"CentOS Linux release 8.0.1905 (Core) ","architecture":"x86_64","version":"Kernel 4.18.0-80.11.2.el8_0.x86_64"}}}}

When secondary members of a
:ref:`replica set <replica-set-members>` initiate
a connection to a primary, they send similar data. A sample log message
containing this initiation connection might appear as follows. The
client data is contained in the ``doc`` object in the **attributes**
field:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {"t":{"$date":"2020-05-20T16:33:40.595+00:00"},"s":"I", "c":"NETWORK", "id":51800, "ctx":"conn214", "svc": "R", "msg":"client metadata", "attr":{"remote":"127.0.0.1:37176","client":"conn214","doc":{"driver":{"name":"NetworkInterfaceTL","version":"4.4.0"},"os":{"type":"Linux","name":"CentOS Linux release 8.0.1905 (Core) ","architecture":"x86_64","version":"Kernel 4.18.0-80.11.2.el8_0.x86_64"}}}}

See the :ref:`examples section <log-message-json-examples>` for a
:ref:`pretty-printed <log-message-pretty-printing>` example showing
client data.

For a complete description of client information and required fields,
see the `MongoDB Handshake specification
<https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/mongodb-handshake/handshake.rst>`_.

.. _log-message-verbosity-levels:

Verbosity Levels
----------------

You can specify the logging verbosity level to increase or decrease
the amount of log messages MongoDB outputs. Verbosity levels can be
adjusted for all components together, or for specific
:ref:`named components <log-message-components>` individually.

Verbosity affects log entries in the :ref:`severity
<log-severity-levels>` categories **Informational** and **Debug** only.
Severity categories above these levels are always shown.

You might set verbosity levels to a high value to show detailed logging
for debugging or development, or to a low value to minimize writes to
the log on a vetted production deployment. [#slow-oplogs]_

View Current Log Verbosity Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the current verbosity levels, use the
:method:`db.getLogComponents()` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getLogComponents()

Your output might resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
    "verbosity" : 0,
    "accessControl" : {
       "verbosity" : -1
    },
    "command" : {
       "verbosity" : -1
    },
    ...
    "storage" : {
       "verbosity" : -1,
       "recovery" : {
          "verbosity" : -1
       },
       "journal" : {
           "verbosity" : -1
       }
    },
    ...

The initial ``verbosity`` entry is the parent verbosity level for all
components, while the individual :ref:`named components
<log-message-components>` that follow, such as ``accessControl``,
indicate the specific verbosity level for that component, overriding the
global verbosity level for that particular component if set.

A value of ``-1``, indicates that the component inherits the verbosity
level of their parent, if they have one (as with ``recovery`` above,
inheriting from ``storage``), or the global verbosity level if they do
not (as with ``command``). Inheritance relationships for verbosity
levels are indicated in the :ref:`components section
<log-message-components>`.

.. _log-messages-configure-verbosity:

Configure Log Verbosity Levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the verbosity level using: the
:setting:`systemLog.verbosity` and
``systemLog.component.<name>.verbosity`` settings, the
:parameter:`logComponentVerbosity` parameter, or the
:method:`db.setLogLevel()` method. [#slow-oplogs]_

``systemLog`` Verbosity Settings
````````````````````````````````

To configure the default log level for all :ref:`components
<log-message-components>`, use the :setting:`systemLog.verbosity`
setting. To configure the level of specific components, use the
``systemLog.component.<name>.verbosity`` settings.

For example, the following configuration sets the
:setting:`systemLog.verbosity` to ``1``, the
:setting:`systemLog.component.query.verbosity` to ``2``, the
:setting:`systemLog.component.storage.verbosity` to ``2``, and the
:setting:`systemLog.component.storage.journal.verbosity` to ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   systemLog:
      verbosity: 1
      component:
         query:
            verbosity: 2
         storage:
            verbosity: 2
            journal:
               verbosity: 1

You would set these values in the :ref:`configuration file
<configuration-options>` or on the command line for your
:binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

All components not specified explicitly in the configuration have a
verbosity level of ``-1``, indicating that they inherit the verbosity
level of their parent, if they have one, or the global verbosity level
(:setting:`systemLog.verbosity`) if they do not.

``logComponentVerbosity`` Parameter
```````````````````````````````````

To set the :parameter:`logComponentVerbosity` parameter, pass a
document with the verbosity settings to change.

For example, the following sets the :setting:`default verbosity level
<systemLog.verbosity>` to ``1``, the :setting:`query
<systemLog.component.query.verbosity>` to ``2``, the :setting:`storage
<systemLog.component.storage.verbosity>` to ``2``, and the
:setting:`storage.journal
<systemLog.component.storage.journal.verbosity>` to ``1``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( {
      setParameter: 1,
      logComponentVerbosity: {
         verbosity: 1,
         query: {
            verbosity: 2
         },
         storage: {
            verbosity: 2,
            journal: {
               verbosity: 1
            }
         }
      }
   } )

You would set these values from :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

``db.setLogLevel()``
````````````````````

Use the :method:`db.setLogLevel()` method to update a single component
log level. For a component, you can specify verbosity level of ``0`` to
``5``, or you can specify ``-1`` to inherit the verbosity of the
parent. For example, the following sets the
:setting:`systemLog.component.query.verbosity` to its parent verbosity
(i.e. default verbosity):

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.setLogLevel(-1, "query")

You would set this value from :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

.. [#slow-oplogs]

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-slow-oplog-log-message-footnote.rst

.. _log-message-slow-ops:

Logging Slow Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Client operations (such as queries) appear in the log if their duration
exceeds the :ref:`slow operation threshold <slowms-threshold-option>` or
when the :ref:`log verbosity level <log-message-verbosity-levels>` is 1
or higher. [#slow-oplogs]_ These log entries include the full command
object associated with the operation.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-log-query-shapes-plan-cache-key.rst

.. important::

   A single operation may log more than one entry. For example, if more 
   than one write in a :ref:`bulk write operation <bulk-write-operations>` 
   exceeds the slow operation threshold, each slow write is logged separately. 


Starting in MongoDB 5.0, :ref:`slow operation
<database-profiling-specify-slowms-threshold>` log messages include a 
``remote`` field specifying client IP address.

.. include:: /includes/sbe/fact-slow-ops-logs.rst

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, :ref:`slow operation
<database-profiling-specify-slowms-threshold>` log messages include 
:ref:`cache refresh time fields
<log-messages-cache-refresh-times>`.

Starting in MongoDB 6.3, :ref:`slow operation
<database-profiling-specify-slowms-threshold>` log messages and :ref:`database 
profiler <profiler>` entries include a ``cpuNanos`` field that specifies the 
total CPU time spent by a query operation in nanoseconds. The ``cpuNanos`` field 
is only available on Linux systems.

.. include:: /includes/fact-totalOplogSlotDurationMicros.rst 

.. example:: 

   .. include:: /includes/fact-totalOplogSlotDurationMicrosExample.rst

For a :ref:`pretty-printed <log-message-pretty-printing>` example of a
slow operation log entry, see :ref:`log-message-json-examples`.

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, the ``queryShapeHash`` field for a :ref:`query
shape <query-shapes>` is also included in the slow query log when
available.

Also starting in MongoDB 8.0, the slow query output includes a
``queues`` document that contains information about the operation's
:ref:`server-status-queues`. Each queue in the  ``queues`` field
contains a ``totalTimeQueuedMicros`` field that contains the total
cumulative time, in microseconds, that the operation spent in the
corresponding queue. 

.. _log-messages-remoteOpWaitMillis:

Time Waiting for Shards Logged in ``remoteOpWaitMillis`` Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 5.0

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, you can use the ``remoteOpWaitMillis`` log
field to obtain the wait time (in milliseconds) for results from
:term:`shards <shard>`.

``remoteOpWaitMillis`` is only logged:

- If you configure :ref:`slow operations logging
  <log-message-slow-ops>`.

- On the :term:`shard` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` that merges the results.

To determine if a merge operation or a shard issue is causing a slow
query, compare the ``workingMillis`` and ``remoteOpWaitMillis`` time
fields in the log. ``workingMillis`` is the total time the query took
to complete. Specifically:

- If ``workingMillis`` is slightly longer than ``remoteOpWaitMillis``,
  then most of the time was spent waiting for a shard response. For
  example, ``workingMillis`` of 17 and ``remoteOpWaitMillis`` of 15.

- If ``workingMillis`` is significantly longer than
  ``remoteOpWaitMillis``, then most of the time was spent performing the
  merge. For example, ``workingMillis`` of 100 and
  ``remoteOpWaitMillis`` of 15.

Log Redaction 
-------------

Queryable Encryption Log Redaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using :ref:`Queryable Encryption <qe-manual-feature-qe>`, CRUD
operations against encrypted collections are omitted from the slow query
log. For details, see :ref:`Queryable Encryption redaction <qe-redaction>`.

.. _log-message-parsing:

Parsing Structured Log Messages
-------------------------------

Log parsing is the act of programmatically searching through and
analyzing log files, often in an automated manner. With the introduction
of structured logging, log parsing is made simpler and
more powerful. For example:

- Log message fields are presented as key-value pairs. Log parsers can
  query by specific keys of interest to efficiently filter results.

- Log messages always contain the same message structure. Log parsers
  can reliably extract information from any log message, without needing
  to code for cases where information is missing or formatted
  differently.

The following examples demonstrate common log parsing workflows when
working with MongoDB JSON log output.

Log Parsing Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-use-jq-with-structured-logging.rst

These examples use ``jq`` to simplify log parsing.

Counting Unique Messages
````````````````````````

The following example shows the top 10 unique message values in a given
log file, sorted by frequency:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq -r ".msg" /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10

Monitoring Connections
``````````````````````
Remote client connections are shown in the log under the "remote" key
in the attribute object. The following counts all unique connections
over the course of the log file and presents them in descending order by
number of occurrences:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq -r '.attr.remote' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log | grep -v 'null' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r

Note that connections from the same IP address, but connecting over
different ports, are treated as different connections by this command.
You could limit output to consider IP addresses only, with the following
change:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq -r '.attr.remote' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log | grep -v 'null' | awk -F':' '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r

Analyzing Driver Connections
````````````````````````````

The following example counts all remote :driver:`MongoDB driver</>` connections, and
presents each driver type and version in descending order by number
of occurrences:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq -cr '.attr.doc.driver' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log | grep -v null | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn    

Analyzing Client Types
``````````````````````

The following example analyzes the reported :ref:`client data
<log-messages-client-data>` of remote :driver:`MongoDB driver </>`
connections and client applications, including :binary:`~bin.mongosh`,
and prints a total for each unique operating system type that
connected, sorted by frequency:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq -r '.attr.doc.os.type' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log | grep -v null | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

The string "Darwin", as reported in this log field, represents a macOS
client.

Analyzing Slow Queries
``````````````````````

With :ref:`slow operation logging <log-message-slow-ops>` enabled, the
following returns only the slow operations that took above
2000 milliseconds:, for further analysis:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq 'select(.attr.workingMillis>=2000)' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

Consult the `jq documentation <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/>`_
for more information on the ``jq`` filters shown in this example.

.. _log-message-parsing-example-filter-component:

Filtering by Component
``````````````````````

Log components (the third field in the :ref:`JSON log output format
<log-message-json-output-format>`) indicate the :ref:`general category
<log-message-components>` a given log message falls under. Filtering by
component is often a great starting place when parsing log messages for
relevant events.

The following example prints only the log messages of
:ref:`component <log-message-components>` type **REPL**:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq 'select(.c=="REPL")' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

The following example prints all log messages *except* those of
:ref:`component <log-message-components>` type **REPL**:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq 'select(.c!="REPL")' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

The following example print log messages of
:ref:`component <log-message-components>` type **REPL** *or*
**STORAGE**:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq 'select( .c as $c | ["REPL", "STORAGE"] | index($c) )' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

Consult the `jq documentation <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/>`_
for more information on the ``jq`` filters shown in this example.

.. _log-message-parsing-example-filter-id:

Filtering by Known Log ID
`````````````````````````

Log IDs (the fifth field in the :ref:`JSON log output format
<log-message-json-output-format>`) map to specific log events, and can
be relied upon to remain stable over successive MongoDB releases.

As an example, you might be interested in the following two log events,
showing a client connection followed by a disconnection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {"t":{"$date":"2020-06-01T13:06:59.027-0500"},"s":"I", "c":"NETWORK", "id":22943, "ctx":"listener", "svc": "R", "msg":"connection accepted from {session_remote} #{session_id} ({connectionCount}{word} now open)", "attr":{"session_remote":"127.0.0.1:61298", "session_id":164,"connectionCount":11,"word":" connections"}}
   {"t":{"$date":"2020-06-01T13:07:03.490-0500"},"s":"I", "c":"NETWORK", "id":22944, "ctx":"conn157", "svc": "R", "msg":"end connection {remote} ({connectionCount}{word} now open)", "attr":{"remote":"127.0.0.1:61298","connectionCount":10,"word":" connections"}}

The log IDs for these two entries are ``22943`` and ``22944``
respectively. You could then filter your log output to show only these
log IDs, effectively showing only client connection activity, using the
following ``jq`` syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq 'select( .id as $id | [22943, 22944] | index($id) )' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

Consult the `jq documentation <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/>`_
for more information on the ``jq`` filters shown in this example.

.. _log-message-parsing-example-filter-timestamp:

Filtering by Date Range
```````````````````````

Log output can be further refined by filtering on the timestamp field,
limiting log entries returned to a specific date range. For example, 
the following returns all log entries that occurred on April 15th, 2020:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq 'select(.t["$date"] >= "2020-04-15T00:00:00.000" and .t["$date"] <= "2020-04-15T23:59:59.999")' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

Note that this syntax includes the full timestamp, including
milliseconds but excluding the timezone offset. 

Filtering by date range can be combined with any of the examples above,
creating weekly reports or yearly summaries for example. The following
syntax expands the "Monitoring Connections" example from earlier to
limit results to the month of May, 2020:

.. code-block:: bash

   jq 'select(.t["$date"] >= "2020-05-01T00:00:00.000" and .t["$date"] <= "2020-05-31T23:59:59.999" and .attr.remote)' /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

Consult the `jq documentation <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/>`_
for more information on the ``jq`` filters shown in this example.

Log Ingestion Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Log ingestion services are third-party products that intake and
aggregate log files, usually from a distributed cluster of systems, and
provide ongoing analysis of that data in a central location.

The :ref:`JSON log format <log-message-json-output-format>` allows for more 
flexibility when working with log ingestion and analysis services. Whereas 
plaintext logs generally require some manner of transformation before being 
eligible for use with these products, JSON files can often be consumed out of 
the box, depending on the service. Further, JSON-formatted logs offer more
control when performing filtering for these services, as the
key-value structure offers the ability to specifically import only the
fields of interest, while omitting the rest.

Consult the documentation for your chosen third-party log ingestion
service for more information.

.. _log-message-json-examples:

Log Message Examples
--------------------

The following examples show log messages in JSON output
format. 

These log messages are presented in :ref:`pretty-printed format

Slow Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, slow operations are logged based on the time
that MongoDB spends working on that operation, rather than the total
latency for the operation.

You can use the metrics in the slow operation log to identify where an
operation spends time in its lifecycle, which helps identify possible
performance improvements.

In the following example log message:

- The amount of time spent waiting for resources while executing the
  query is shown in these metrics:
  
  - ``queues.execution.totalTimeQueuedMicros``
  - ``timeAcquiringMicros``

- ``workingMillis`` is the amount of time that MongoDB spends working on
  the operation.
   
- ``durationMillis`` is the operation's total latency.

View
~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, :ref:`log messages for slow queries
<log-message-slow-ops>` on :ref:`views <views-landing-page>` include a
``resolvedViews`` field that contains the view details:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   "resolvedViews": [ {
      "viewNamespace": <String>,  // namespace and view name
      "dependencyChain": <Array of strings>,  // view name and collection
      "resolvedPipeline": <Array of documents>  // aggregation pipeline for view
   } ]

The following example uses the ``test`` database and creates a view
named ``myView`` that sorts the documents in ``myCollection`` by the
``firstName`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use test
   db.createView( "myView", "myCollection", [ { $sort: { "firstName" : 1 } } ] )

Assume a :ref:`slow query <log-message-slow-ops>` is run on ``myView``.

Session Workflow Log Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.3, a message is added to the log if the time to
send an operation response exceeds the :ref:`slowms threshold option
<slowms-threshold-option>`.

The message is known as a session workflow log message and contains
various times to perform an operation in a database session.

Example session workflow log message:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      "t": {
        "$date": "2022-12-14T17:22:44.233+00:00"

      "c": "EXECUTOR",
      "id": 6983000,
      "ctx": "conn1",
      "svc": "R",
      "msg": "Slow network response send time",
      "attr": {
         "elapsed": {
            "totalMillis": 109,
            "activeMillis": 30,
            "receiveWorkMillis": 2,
            "processWorkMillis": 10,
            "sendResponseMillis": 22,
            "yieldMillis": 15,
            "finalizeMillis": 30
         }
      }
   }

The times are in milliseconds.

A session workflow message is added to the log if ``sendResponseMillis``
exceeds the :ref:`slowms threshold option <slowms-threshold-option>`.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``totalMillis``
     - Total time to perform the operation in the session, which
       includes the time spent waiting for a message to be received.

   * - ``activeMillis``
     - Time between receiving a message and completing the operation
       associated with that message. Time includes sending a response
       and performing any clean up.

   * - ``receivedWorkMillis``
     - Time to receive the operation information over the network.

   * - ``processWorkMillis``
     - Time to process the operation and create the response.

   * - ``sendResponseMillis``
     - Time to send the response.

   * - ``yieldMillis``
     - Time between releasing the worker thread and the thread being
       used again.

   * - ``finalize``
     - Time to end and close the session workflow.

.. _log-messages-connection-acquisition-to-wire:

Connection Acquisition To Wire Log Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.3, a message is added to the log if the time that
an operation waited between acquisition of a server connection and
writing the bytes to send to the server over the network exceeds 1
millisecond.

By default, the message is logged at the ``"I"`` information level, and
at most once every second to avoid too many log messages. If you must
obtain every log message, change your log level to debug.

If the operation wait time exceeds 1 millisecond and the message is
logged at the information level within the last second, then the next
message is logged at the debug level. Otherwise, the next message is
logged at the information level.

Example log message:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      "t": {
         "$date":"2023-01-31T15:22:29.473+00:00"
      },
      "s": "I",
      "c": "NETWORK",
      "id": 6496702,
      "ctx": "ReplicaSetMonitor-TaskExecutor",
      "svc": "R",
      "msg": "Acquired connection for remote operation and completed writing to wire",
      "attr": {
         "durationMicros": 1683
      }
   }
 
The following table describes the ``durationMicros`` field in ``attr``.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``durationMicros``
     - Time in microseconds that the operation waited between
       acquisition of a server connection and writing the bytes to send
       to the server over the network.

.. _log-messages-cache-refresh-times:

Cache Refresh Times
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.1, :ref:`log messages for slow queries
<log-message-slow-ops>` include the following cache refresh time fields:

- ``catalogCacheDatabaseLookupDurationMillis``
- ``catalogCacheCollectionLookupDurationMillis``
- ``databaseVersionRefreshDurationMillis``
- ``shardVersionRefreshMillis``

Starting in MongoDB 7.0, :ref:`log messages for slow queries
<log-message-slow-ops>` also include the 
``catalogCacheIndexLookupDurationMillis`` field that indicates the 
time that the operation spent fetching information from the index 
cache. This release also renames the ``shardVersionRefreshMillis`` 
field to ``placementVersionRefreshMillis``.

The following example includes:

- ``catalogCacheDatabaseLookupDurationMillis``
- ``catalogCacheCollectionLookupDurationMillis``
- ``catalogCacheIndexLookupDurationMillis``
