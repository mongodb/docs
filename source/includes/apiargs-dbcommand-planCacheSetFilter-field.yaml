  The query predicate associated with the index filter. Together with
  the ``sort`` and the ``projection``, the ``query`` predicate make up
  the :term:`query shape` for the specified index filter.

  Only the structure of the predicate, including the field names, are
  significant; the values in the query predicate are
  insignificant. As such, query predicates cover similar queries that
  differ only in the values.
