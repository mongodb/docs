The :guilabel:`Connect` dialog for a {+database-deployment+} provides the details to
connect to a {+database-deployment+} using :dl:`Compass <compass>`.

.. _compass-connect-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

|tls|
~~~~~

Use |compass| 1.5 or later to connect to |service| {+database-deployment+}s. These
versions support the required |sni| |tls| extension.

|compass|
~~~~~~~~~

To complete this procedure, do one of the following:

- Install |compass|. See :compass:`Compass Installation </install/>`.

- Upgrade to the latest version of |compass| by downloading |compass|
  from links in the |service| :guilabel:`Connect` dialog. To access these
  links, click :guilabel:`Connect` for the {+database-deployment+} you
  wish to connect to, then click :guilabel:`Connect with MongoDB Compass`.

             * - Field Name
               - Description

             * - :guilabel:`Hostname`

               - Hostname of primary for a replica set or the hostname
                 for the |mongos| for a sharded cluster.

                 To locate the hostname of the replica set primary in
                 the |service| UI:

                 #. Click :guilabel:`Database`.
                 #. Click the cluster to which you want to connect.
                 #. Click the replica set member marked as
                    :guilabel:`PRIMARY`.
                 #. Copy the hostname of the replica set.

                 To locate the hostname for a sharded cluster in the
                 |service| user interface:

                 1. Click :guilabel:`Connect` for the cluster.
                 2. Click :guilabel:`Connect Your Application`.
                 3. Extract the |mongos| hostname from the
                    :manual:`URI connection string </reference/connection-string>`.

                 Make note of the port number of the primary or
                 |mongos|. Use that port to fill in the
                 :guilabel:`Port` field in |compass|.

             * - :guilabel:`Port`

               - Port of the primary for a replica set or the port of
                 the |mongos| for a sharded cluster.

             * - :guilabel:`Authentication`
               - Select ``Username / Password``.

             * - :guilabel:`Username`

               - MongoDB user. The |service| connection string
                 displays the MongoDB administration user set up for
                 the {+database-deployment+}. You can connect with a different MongoDB
                 user.

             * - :guilabel:`Password`

               - Password associated with the specified MongoDB user.

             * - :guilabel:`Authentication Database`

               - Specify ``"admin"``.

             * - :guilabel:`Replica Set Name`
               - Name of the |service| cluster's replica set.

                 To retrieve the replica set name:

                 1. Click the :guilabel:`Connect` button for the
                    cluster.
                 2. Select :guilabel:`Connect Your Application`.
                 3. Extract the replica set name from the |uri|
                    connection string's ``replicaSet`` value.

             * - :guilabel:`Read Preference`
               - Specify how |compass| directs read operations. Options
                 are ``Primary``, ``Primary Preferred``, ``Secondary``,
                 ``Secondary Preferred``, and ``Nearest``. See
                 :manual:`/core/read-preference`.

             * - :guilabel:`SSL`
               - Select ``"Use System CA / Atlas Deployment"``

             * - :guilabel:`SSH Tunnel`
               - Select ``"Off"``

             * - :guilabel:`Favorite Name`
               - Enter a name for the connection if you want to save it
                 as a favorite.
