What happens when I reach my Atlas storage limit?
-------------------------------------------------

The result of reaching your |service| storage limit depends on the
|service| cluster you are using.

- For shared clusters (``M0``, ``M2``, ``M5``), the maximum storage is
  a hard limit and cannot be exceeded. You can add additional storage
  by upgrading to a dedicated cluster (``M10+``). For details on how
  |service| calculates storage limits for shared clusters, see
  :ref:`this section <faq-caluculate-shared-storage-limit>` of the FAQ.

- By default, ``M10+`` clusters
  :ref:`auto-expand storage <scale-cluster-storage>` based on disk
  usage thresholds. To modify this setting to a fixed storage limit,
  refer to the :ref:`Modify a Cluster <scale-cluster-storage>` page.

If you attempt to write to a shared cluster that does not have space
for the desired write operation, |service| displays an error message
similar to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   WriteResult({
     "writeError": {
       "code": 8000,
       "errmsg": "you are over your space quota, using 513 MB of 512 MB"
     }
   })

.. seealso::

   To learn about the differences between shared and dedicated
   clusters, see
   :doc:`Atlas M0 {+Free-cluster+}, M2, and M5 Limitations </reference/free-shared-limitations/>`.

.. tip::

   You can configure alerts which trigger once your allocated storage
   reaches a specified threshold. |service| calculates allocated
   storage using metrics returned by the
   :dbcommand:`dbStats` command.

   To learn more about storage alerts, see
   :ref:`DB Storage alert conditions <db-storage-alerts>`.

.. _faq-caluculate-shared-storage-limit:

How does Atlas calculate storage limits for shared clusters (M0, M2, M5)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| calculates the storage limit for shared clusters based on
data usage, as opposed to the ``storageSize`` metric used by
non-shared clusters (which includes compression). |service| determines
data usage by summing a cluster's ``dataSize`` and ``indexSize``.  You
can issue the :manual:`db.stats() </reference/method/db.stats/>`
method to view the values of these fields.

Without using Provisioned IOPS on MongoDB Atlas on AWS, what kind of IOPS should I expect?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|service| provides an estimate of how many 16K |iops| you can expect,
calculated as the lesser of 3 |iops| per provisioned GB, or the cluster
node's maximum |iops| capacity.

Can I configure a {+cluster+} with more storage than the standard limit for the {+cluster+} tier?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For {+clusters+} that meet specific criteria, yes. To learn which {+clusters+} support extended 
storage and how to enable this for your projects, see :ref:`project-settings`.
