Consider Query Operators and Query Complexity
---------------------------------------------

The complexity level of |fts| queries and the type of :ref:`operators
<fts-operators>` used can affect database performance. Highly
complex queries with :ref:`multiple clauses <compound-ref>` are
resource-intensive, as are queries which use the :ref:`regex
<regex-ref>` (regular expression) or the :ref:`wildcard <wildcard-ref>` operator.

Compound Queries 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your query includes multiple nested :ref:`compound-ref` statements,
ensure that these are not redundant. If the clauses are added
programmatically, consider implementing the logic in the application to
avoid inclusion of redundant clauses in the queries. Every score
calculation per field that ``mongot`` performs, such as for the ``must``
and ``should`` clauses, increases execution time.  

Faceted Search 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the |fts| :ref:`fts-facet-ref` collector to extract
metadata and avoid running multiple queries for search results and 
metadata. For an example, see the :ref:`Metadata and Search Results
example <fts-facet-egs>`. 

Scoring the Results  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|fts| queries are ranked by :ref:`score <scoring-ref>`. Queries that
return a large number of results are more computationally intensive
because they must keep track of all the scores for the result set.

Use ``$search`` Instead of ``$text`` or ``$regex``
--------------------------------------------------

For applications that rely heavily on MongoDB :query:`$text` and
:query:`$regex` queries, use the following recommendations to determine
whether to refactor your applications or migrate your applications to
|fts| :pipeline:`$search`. The ``$search`` aggregation pipeline stage
provides features that are either not available through the MongoDB
operators or are available through the MongoDB operators but not as
performant as |fts| ``$search``.

The following table shows how MongoDB :query:`$regex`, :query:`$text`,
and |fts| :pipeline:`$search` address your application's requirements. 

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 40 10 60 
   :header-rows: 1

   * - If your application requires... 
     - Use...
     - Because...

   * - Datastore to respect write concerns
     - :query:`$regex`
     - For transactions with heavy reads after writes, we recommend
       :query:`$regex`. For :pipeline:`$search`, reads after writes
       should be rare.  

   * - Cluster optimized for write performance
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| indexes don't degrade {+cluster+} write performance.

   * - Searching through large data sets
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| uses an inverted index, which enables fast document retrieval
       at very large scales.

   * - Language awareness 
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| supports many :ref:`language analyzers
       <ref-language-analyzers>` that can tokenize (create searchable
       terms) languages, remove stopwords, and interpret diacritics for
       improved search relevance. To learn more, see
       :ref:`multilingual-tutorial`. 

   * - Case-insensitive text search
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - :pipeline:`$search` offers more capabilities than
       :query:`$regex`. 

   * - Highlighting result text
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| :ref:`highlighting <highlight-ref>` allows you to
       contextualize the documents in the results, which is essential
       for natural language queries.

   * - Geospatial-aware search queries
     - :query:`$regex` or :pipeline:`$search`
     - MongoDB :query:`$regex` and |fts| :pipeline:`$search` treat
       geospatial parameters differently. In MongoDB, lines between
       coordinates are spherical, which is well-suited for coordinates
       for long distance such as air flight. |fts| uses Lucene, which
       draws a straight line between coordinates and is well-suited
       for short distance. To learn more, see
       :ref:`run-geo-search-tutorial`. 

   * - On-premises or local deployment
     - :query:`$regex` or :query:`$text`
     - |fts| is unavailable for on-premise or local deployment. |fts|
       is only available for data on the |service| {+cluster+}.

   * - Autocompletion of search queries
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - For :ref:`autocomplete-ref` of characters (nGrams), |fts|
       includes ``edgeGrams`` for left-to-right autocomplete, ``nGrams``
       for autocomplete of languages that don't have whitespace, and
       ``rightEdgeGram`` for autocomplete of languages that you write
       and read right-to-left. 
       
       For :ref:`autocomplete-ref` of words (wordGrams), |fts| includes
       :ref:`shingle-tf-ref` token filter, which supports word-based
       autocomplete by concatenating adjacent words to create a single
       token. 

       To learn more, see the :ref:`autocomplete-tutorial` tutorial.

   * - Fuzzy matching on text input 
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| :ref:`text-ref` and :ref:`autocomplete-ref` operators
       support ``fuzzy`` matching to filter on input text and address
       misspelled words (typos).

   * - Filtering based on multiple strings
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| :ref:`compound-ref` supports filtering based on multiple
       strings.

   * - Relevance score sorted search 
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| uses the `BM25 algorithm
       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25>`__ for determining
       the search relevance score of documents. It supports advanced
       configuration through :ref:`scoring-boost` expressions like
       multiply and gaussian decay, as well as analyzers, search
       operators, and synonyms. To learn more, see
       :ref:`compound-query-custom-score-tutorial`.

   * - Partial indexes 
     - :query:`$regex`
     - |fts| doesn't support partial indexing. 

   * - Patial match
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| :ref:`wildcard-ref` and :ref:`autocomplete-ref` operators
       support partial match queries. To learn more, see
       :ref:`partial-match-tutorial`. 

   * - Single compound index on arrays
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| term indexes are intersected in a single |fts| index and 
       eliminate the need for compound indexes for filtering on arrays.

   * - Synonyms search
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| supports :ref:`synonyms <synonyms-ref>` defined in a
       separate collection, which you can reference in your search index
       for use. To learn more, see the :ref:`synonyms-tutorial` tutorial.

   * - Faceting for counts
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| provides fast :ref:`counts <count-ref>` of documents based
       on text criteria, and also supports :ref:`faceted
       <fts-facet-ref>` search for numbers and dates. To learn more, see
       :ref:`facet-tutorial`. 

   * - Extract metadata
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| :ref:`fts-facet-ref` collector returns metadata and doesn't
       require you to run multiple queries for retrieving metadata. To
       learn more, see the :ref:`facet-tutorial` tutorial.

   * - Custom analyzers 
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| supports :ref:`custom analyzers <custom-analyzers>` to suit
       your specific indexing requirements. For example, you can index
       and search email addresses and |http| or |https| |url|\s using
       custom analyzers. To learn more, see
       :ref:`diacritic-insensitive-tutorial`. 

   * - Searching phrases or multiple words
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| :ref:`phrase-ref` operator supports searching for a
       sequence of terms. 

   * - Searching with regular expression
     - :pipeline:`$search`
     - |fts| provides improved performance when you use the |fts|
       :ref:`autocomplete-ref` operator instead.

.. seealso:: 

   - :ref:`text-to-search` - describes how you can replace
     :query:`$text` aggregation pipeline stage in your query with
     :pipeline:`$search` to improve both the flexibility and performance
     of these queries.  
   - :ref:`regex-to-search` - describes how you can replace
     inefficient regex matching with :pipeline:`$search` to improve the
     performance of text queries. 

.. _query-limit-and-facet-agg-stage:

Use ``$limit`` Before ``$facet``
--------------------------------

Using a :pipeline:`$limit` aggregation pipeline stage after a
:pipeline:`$facet` aggregation pipeline stage might negatively impact query performance. To avoid
performance bottlenecks, use :pipeline:`$limit` before
:pipeline:`$facet`.  

.. example:: 

   .. code-block:: json 
      :copyable: false 

      {
        {
          "$search": {...}
        },
        { "$limit": 20 },
        {
          "$facet": {
            "results": [],
            "totalCount": $$SEARCH_META
          }
        }
      }

For a demonstration, see the following examples: 

- :ref:`Metadata and Search Results Example <fts-facet-egs>` 
- :ref:`Facet Example <fts-count-aggregation-variable>`

.. _query-match-agg-stage:

Avoid ``$match`` After ``$search`` 
----------------------------------

Using a :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>`
aggregation pipeline stage after a :ref:`$search <query-syntax-ref>`
stage can drastically slow down query results. If possible, design
your ``$search`` query so that all necessary filtering occurs in the
``$search`` stage to remove the need for a ``$match`` stage. 

The |fts| :ref:`compound-ref` operator helps with queries that
require multiple filtering operations. If you must use the
:pipeline:`$match` stage in your aggregation pipeline, consider using
the :ref:`storedSource <fts-stored-source-definition>` option to store 
only the fields that your :pipeline:`$match` condition needs. You can 
then use the :ref:`returnStoredSource <fts-return-stored-source-option>`
option to retrieve stored fields.

.. seealso:: 

   - :ref:`perf-ref-stored-source`
   - :ref:`$match Example <fts-return-stored-source-egs>`

.. _query-group-agg-stage:

Avoid ``$group`` After ``$search``  
----------------------------------

Using a :pipeline:`$group` aggregation pipeline stage after a
:ref:`$search <query-syntax-ref>` stage can slow down query results. If
you use :pipeline:`$group` to get basic counts for field aggregations,
we recommend that you use :ref:`fts-facet-ref` inside the
:pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage instead.  

.. _query-count-agg-stage:

Avoid ``$count`` After ``$search`` 
----------------------------------

Using a :pipeline:`$count` aggregation pipeline stage after a
:ref:`$search <query-syntax-ref>` stage can slow down query results. If 
you use :pipeline:`$count` to get a count of the number of documents, 
we recommend that you use :ref:`count <count-ref>` inside the
:pipeline:`$search` or :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage instead.  

.. _query-sort-agg-stage:

Avoid ``$sort`` After ``$search`` 
---------------------------------

Using a :manual:`$sort </reference/operator/aggregation/sort/>` 
aggregation pipeline stage after a :ref:`$search <query-syntax-ref>` 
stage can drastically slow down query results. 

- For sorting numeric, date, or string fields,  use the ``sort`` option with
  the :pipeline:`$search` stage. To learn more, see :ref:`sort-ref`.  
- For sorting geo fields, use the :ref:`near <near-ref>` operator. 
- To sort other fields, use ``$sort`` and :ref:`returnStoredSource
  <fts-return-stored-source-option>` fields.  

Limit Use of ``$skip`` and ``$limit`` After ``$search`` 
-------------------------------------------------------

Using :pipeline:`$skip` and :pipeline:`$limit` to retrieve results
non-sequentially might be slow if the results for your query are large. 
For optimal performance, use the :pipeline:`$search` ``searchAfter`` or
``searchBefore`` options to paginate results. To learn more, see 
:ref:`fts-paginate-results`. 

To return non-sequential results, such as jumping from page 2 to page 5,
you can use the following pipeline stages: 

- :pipeline:`$search` ``searchAfter`` the last result on Page 2
- :pipeline:`$skip` documents on Pages 3 and 4 
- :pipeline:`$limit` results for Page 5

Here, your query is optimized to skip only 2 pages of results, instead
of skipping 4 pages if you didn't use ``searchAfter``. For a
demonstration of this, see :ref:`pagination-skip-limit-tutorial`.

.. _query-performance-monitoring:

Monitor Performance 
-------------------

You can :ref:`monitor <monitor-cluster-metrics>` your |service|
cluster and view charts with performance statistics on the |service|
:guilabel:`Metrics` tab. These metrics can help you see how |fts|
queries and index building affect your cluster's performance. To learn 
more, see :ref:`review-atlas-search-metrics`.

|service| might trigger some |service| :ref:`alerts <alerts>` when:

- |fts| queries your {+database-deployments+}, which can impact
  |service| performance metrics, such as the :ref:`query targeting 
  <query-targeting-resolution>` metrics.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-query-targeting-mongot.rst

- |fts| replicates data from MongoDB, which contributes to the 
  :ref:`metrics <monitor-cluster-metrics>` measured in |service|, such 
  as the number of :guilabel:`getmore` operations.

.. note::

   If your cluster's resources are stretched or near the
   limits of acceptable performance, consider :ref:`upgrading
   <scale-cluster>` to a larger cluster tier before implementing
   |fts| functionality.
