Document Record Padding
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Each document in a MongoDB collection has allocated *record* space
which includes the entire document *and* a small amount of
padding. This padding makes it possible for update operations to
increase the size of a document slightly without causing the document
to outgrow the allocated record size.

Documents in MongoDB can grow up to the full maximum :limit:`BSON
document size <BSON Document Size>`. However, when documents outgrow
their allocated record size MongoDB must allocate a new record and
move the document to the new record. Update operations that do not
cause a document to grow, (i.e. *in-place* updates,) are significantly
more efficient than those updates that cause document growth. Use
:doc:`data models </core/data-modeling>` that minimize the need for
document growth when possible.

For complete examples of update operations, see
:doc:`/core/update`.

Padding Factor
--------------

If an update operation does not cause the document to increase in
size, MongoDB can apply the update in-place. Some updates
change the size of the document, for example using the
:operator:`$push` operator to append a sub-document to an array can
cause the top level document to grow beyond its allocated space.

When documents grow, MongoDB relocates the document on disk with
enough contiguous space to hold the document. These relocations
take longer than in-place updates, particularly if the collection has
indexes that MongoDB must update all index entries. If
collection has many indexes, the move will impact write throughput.

To minimize document movements, MongoDB employs padding. MongoDB
adaptively learns if documents in a collection tend to grow, and if
they do, adds a :data:`~collStats.paddingFactor` so that the documents
have room to grow on subsequent writes. The
:data:`~collStats.paddingFactor` indicates the padding for new inserts
and moves.

.. versionadded:: 2.2
   You can use the :dbcommand:`collMod` command
   with the :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` flag so that MongoDB
   allocates document space in sizes that are powers of 2. This helps
   ensure that MongoDB can efficiently reuse the space freed as a
   result of deletions or document relocations. As with all padding,
   using document space allocations with power of 2 sizes minimizes,
   but does not eliminate, document movements.

To check the current :data:`~collStats.paddingFactor` on a collection, you can
run the :method:`db.collection.stats()` operation in the
:program:`mongo` shell, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.myCollection.stats()

Since MongoDB writes each document at a different point in time, the
padding for each document will not be the same. You can calculate the
padding size by subtracting 1 from the :data:`~collStats.paddingFactor`, for
example:

.. code-block:: none

   padding size = (paddingFactor - 1) * <document size>.

For example, a :data:`~collStats.paddingFactor` of ``1.0`` specifies no padding
whereas a paddingFactor of ``1.5`` specifies a padding size of ``0.5`` or 50
percent (50%) of the document size.

Because the :data:`~collStats.paddingFactor` is relative to the size of each
document, you cannot calculate the exact amount of padding for a
collection based on the average document size and padding factor.

If an update operation causes the document to *decrease* in size, for
instance if you perform an :operator:`$unset` or a :operator:`$pop`
update, the document remains in place and effectively has more
padding. If the document remains this size, the space is not reclaimed
until you perform a :dbcommand:`compact` or a
:dbcommand:`repairDatabase` operation.

.. note::

   The following operations remove padding:

   - :dbcommand:`compact`,
   - :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, and
   - initial replica sync operations.

   However, with the :dbcommand:`compact` command, you can run the
   command with a ``paddingFactor`` or a ``paddingBytes`` parameter.

   Padding is also removed if you use :program:`mongoexport` from a
   collection. If you use :program:`mongoimport` into a new
   collection, :program:`mongoimport` will not add padding.  If you
   use :program:`mongoimport` with an existing collection with
   padding, :program:`mongoimport` will not affect the existing
   padding.

   When a database operation removes padding, subsequent update that
   require changes in record sizes will have reduced throughput until
   the collection's padding factor grows. Padding does not affect
   in-place, and after :dbcommand:`compact`,
   :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, and replica set initial sync
   the collection will require less storage.

.. COMMENT -- not sure if we really need this manual padding info or if
   it belongs here, but ...
