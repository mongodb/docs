Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about **Codecs** and the supporting classes that
handle the encoding and decoding of Kotlin objects to and from BSON data
in the MongoDB Kotlin driver. The ``Codec`` abstraction allows you to map any Kotlin type to
a corresponding BSON type. You can use this to map your domain objects
directly to and from BSON instead of using data classes or an intermediate
map-based object such as ``Document`` or ``BsonDocument``.

You can learn how to specify custom encoding and decoding logic using
the ``Codec`` abstraction and view example implementations in the following
sections:

- :ref:`Codec <codecs-codec>`
- :ref:`CodecRegistry <codecs-codecregistry>`
- :ref:`CodecProvider <codecs-codecprovider>`
- :ref:`Custom Codec Example <codecs-custom-example>`

.. _codecs-codec:

Codec
-----

The ``Codec`` interface contains abstract methods for serializing and
deserializing Kotlin objects to BSON data. You can define your conversion logic
between BSON and your Kotlin object in your implementation of this interface.

To implement the ``Codec`` interface, override the ``encode()``, ``decode()``,
and ``getEncoderClass()`` abstract methods.

The ``encode()`` method requires the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20

   * - Parameter Type
     - Description

   * - ``writer``
     - An instance of a class that implements ``BsonWriter``, an interface type
       that exposes methods for writing a BSON document. For example, the
       ``BsonBinaryWriter`` implementation writes to a binary stream of data.
       Use this instance to write your BSON value using the appropriate
       write method.

   * - ``value``
     - The data that your implementation encodes. The type must match the type
       variable assigned to your implementation.

   * - ``encoderContext``
     -  Contains meta information about the Kotlin object data that it encodes
        to BSON including whether to store the current value in a
        MongoDB collection.

This method uses the ``BsonWriter`` instance to send the encoded value to
MongoDB and does not return a value.

The ``decode()`` method returns your Kotlin object instance populated with the
value from the BSON data. This method requires the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20

   * - Parameter Type
     - Description

   * - ``bsonReader``
     - An instance of a class that implements ``BsonReader``, an interface type
       that exposes methods for reading a BSON document. For example, the
       ``BsonBinaryReader`` implementation reads from a binary stream of data.

   * - ``decoderContext``
     - Contains information about the BSON data that it decodes to a Kotlin
       object.

The ``getEncoderClass()`` method returns a class instance of the Kotlin class
since Kotlin cannot infer the type due to type erasure.

.. _codecs-powerstatus-codec:

See the following code examples that show how you can implement a custom
``Codec``.

The ``PowerStatus`` enum contains the values "ON" and "OFF" to represent
the states of an electrical switch.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CodecTest.snippet.example-enum.kt
   :language: kotlin

The ``PowerStatusCodec`` class implements ``Codec`` in order to convert
the Kotlin ``enum`` values to corresponding BSON boolean values. The
``encode()`` method converts a ``PowerStatus`` to a BSON boolean and the
``decode()`` method performs the conversion in the opposite direction.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CodecTest.snippet.example-codec.kt
   :language: kotlin

You can add an instance of the ``PowerStatusCodec`` to your ``CodecRegistry``
which contains a mapping between your ``Codec`` and the Kotlin object type to
which it applies. Continue to the :ref:`CodecRegistry <codecs-codecregistry>`
section of this page to see how you can include your ``Codec``.

For more information about the classes and interfaces in this section, see the
following API Documentation:

.. _codecs-codecregistry:

CodecRegistry
-------------

A ``CodecRegistry`` is an immutable collection of ``Codec`` instances that
encode and decode the Kotlin classes they specify. You can use any of the
following ``CodecRegistries`` class static factory methods to construct a
``CodecRegistry`` from the ``Codec`` instances contained in the associated
types:

- ``fromCodecs()``
- ``fromProviders()``
- ``fromRegistries()``

The following code snippet shows how to construct a ``CodecRegistry`` using
the ``fromCodecs()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CodecTest.snippet.init-codec-registry.kt
   :language: kotlin

In the preceding example, we assign the ``CodecRegistry`` the following ``Codec``
implementations:

- ``IntegerCodec``, a ``Codec`` that converts ``Integers`` and is part of the BSON package.
- :ref:`PowerStatusCodec <codecs-powerstatus-codec>`, our sample ``Codec``
  that converts Kotlin enum values to BSON booleans.

You can retrieve the ``Codec`` instances from the ``CodecRegistry`` instance
from the prior example using the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CodecTest.snippet.get-codec-from-registry.kt
   :language: kotlin

If you attempt to retrieve a ``Codec`` instance for a class that is not
registered, the ``get()`` method throws a ``CodecConfigurationException``
exception.

For more information about the classes and interfaces in this section, see the
following API Documentation:

- `CodecRegistries <{+api-root+}/bson/org/bson/codecs/configuration/CodecRegistries.html>`__
- `IntegerCodec <{+api-root+}/bson/org/bson/codecs/IntegerCodec.html>`__

.. _codecs-codecprovider:

CodecProvider
-------------

A ``CodecProvider`` is an interface that contains abstract methods that create
``Codec`` instances and assign them to a ``CodecRegistry`` instance. Similar
to the ``CodecRegistry``, the BSON library uses the ``Codec`` instances
retrieved by the ``get()`` method to convert between Kotlin and BSON data types.

However, in cases in which you add a class that contains fields that require
corresponding ``Codec`` objects, you need to ensure that you instantiate the
``Codec`` objects for the class' fields before you instantiate the
``Codec`` for the class. You can use the ``CodecRegistry`` parameter in
the ``get()`` method to pass any of the ``Codec`` instances that the
``Codec`` relies on.

The following code example shows how you can implement ``CodecProvider`` to
pass the ``MonolightCodec`` any ``Codec`` instances it needs in a
``CodecRegistry`` instance such as the ``PowerStatusCodec`` from our prior
example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CodecTest.snippet.example-codec-2.kt
   :language: kotlin

To see a runnable example that demonstrates read and write operations using
these ``Codec`` classes, see the :ref:`Custom Codec Example <codecs-custom-example>`
section of this guide.

.. _codecs-default-codec-registry:

Default Codec Registry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default codec registry is a set of ``CodecProvider`` classes that
specify conversion between commonly-used Kotlin and MongoDB types. The
driver automatically uses the default codec registry unless you specify
a different one.

.. _codecs-override:

If you need to override the behavior of one or more ``Codec`` classes, but
keep the behavior from the default codec registry for the other classes,
you can specify all of the registries in order of precedence. For example,
suppose you wanted to override the default provider behavior of a ``Codec`` for
enum types with your custom ``MyEnumCodec``, you must add it to the registry
list prior to the default codec registry as shown in the example below:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CodecTest.snippet.override-default-codec.kt
   :language: kotlin

For more information about the classes and interfaces in this section, see
the following API documentation sections:

- `CodecProvider <{+api-root+}/bson/org/bson/codecs/configuration/CodecProvider.html>`__
- `Default codec registry <{+core-api+}/MongoClientSettings.html#getDefaultCodecRegistry()>`__

BsonTypeClassMap
----------------

The ``BsonTypeClassMap`` class contains a recommended mapping between BSON
and Kotlin types. You can use this class in your custom ``Codec`` or
``CodecProvider`` to help you manage which Kotlin types to decode your BSON
types to container classes that implement ``Iterable`` or ``Map`` such as
the ``Document`` class.

You can add or modify the ``BsonTypeClassMap`` default mapping by passing a
``Map`` containing new or replacement entries.

The following code snippet shows how you can retrieve the Kotlin class type
that corresponds to the BSON type in the default ``BsonTypeClassMap``
instance:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/CodecTest.snippet.bson-type-class-map.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: console

      Java type: java.util.List

You can modify these mappings in your instance by specifying replacements in the
``BsonTypeClassMap`` constructor. The following code snippet shows how
you can replace the mapping for ``ARRAY`` in your ``BsonTypeClassMap``
instance with the ``Set`` class:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/CodecTest.snippet.bson-type-class-map-replacement.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: console

      Java type: java.util.Set

For a complete list of the default mappings, refer to the
`BsonTypeClassMap <{+api-root+}/bson/org/bson/codecs/BsonTypeClassMap.html>`__ API Documentation.

For an example of how the ``Document`` class uses ``BsonTypeClassMap``, see
the driver source code for the following classes:

- :github:`DocumentCodecProvider <mongodb/mongo-java-driver/blob/master/bson/src/main/org/bson/codecs/DocumentCodecProvider.java>`
- :github:`DocumentCodec <mongodb/mongo-java-driver/blob/master/bson/src/main/org/bson/codecs/DocumentCodec.java>`

.. _codecs-custom-example:

Custom Codec Example
--------------------

In this section, we show how you can implement ``Codec`` and ``CodecProvider``
to define the encoding and decoding logic for a custom Kotlin class. We also show
how you can specify and use your custom implementations to perform insert
and retrieve operations.

.. tip:: Kotlin Serialization

   As an alternative to implementing custom codecs, you can use
   Kotlin serialization to handle your data encoding and decoding with 
   ``@Serializable`` classes. You might choose Kotlin serialization if you are
   already familiar with the framework or prefer to use an idiomatic Kotlin approach.  
   See the :ref:`Kotlin Serialization <fundamentals-kotlin-serialization>` 
   documentation for more information.

The following code snippet shows our example custom class called ``Monolight``
and its fields that we want to store and retrieve from a MongoDB collection:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CodecTest.snippet.example-class.kt
   :language: kotlin

This class contains the following fields, each of which we need to assign a
``Codec``:

- ``powerStatus`` describes whether the light is switched "on" or "off" for
  which we use the :ref:`PowerStatusCodec <codecs-powerstatus-codec>` that
  converts specific enum values to BSON booleans.
- ``colorTemperature`` describes the color of the light and contains an
  ``Int`` value for which we use the ``IntegerCodec`` included in the
  BSON library.

The following code example shows how we can implement a ``Codec`` for the
``Monolight`` class. Note that the constructor expects an instance of
``CodecRegistry`` from which it retrieves the ``Codec`` instances it needs
to encode and decode its fields:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CodecTest.snippet.example-codec-2.kt
   :language: kotlin

To ensure we make the ``Codec`` instances for the fields available for
``Monolight``, we implement a custom ``CodecProvider`` shown in the following
code example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CodecTest.snippet.codec-provider.kt
   :language: kotlin

After defining the conversion logic, we can perform the following:

- Store data from instances of ``Monolight`` into MongoDB
- Retrieve data from MongoDB into instances of ``Monolight``

The following example class contains code that assigns the
``MonolightCodecProvider`` to the ``MongoCollection`` instance by passing it
to the ``withCodecRegistry()`` method. The example class also inserts and
retrieves data using the ``Monolight`` class and associated codecs:

.. io-code-block::
   
   .. input:: /examples/generated/CodecTest.snippet.full-example.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: none

      [Monolight [powerStatus=ON, colorTemperature=5200]]
