Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to serialize **globally unique identifiers**  
(`GUIDs <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamicsax-2012/developer/guids>`__),
also known as **universally unique identifiers** (UUIDs).

.. tip::

   In MongoDB applications, ``ObjectId`` can be used as a unique identifier for
   a document. Consider using ``ObjectId`` in place of a GUID with MongoDB
   applications where possible.

A GUID is a 16-byte integer that you can use as a unique ID for a MongoDB document. 
Originally, GUIDs in MongoDB were represented as ``BsonBinaryData`` values of subtype 3. 
Subtype 3 did not standardize the byte order during serialization, which led to 
inconsistent serialization across MongoDB drivers. 
To standardize the byte order and ensure consistent serialization across drivers, we 
created ``BsonBinaryData`` subtype 4.

.. note::
   
   Use ``BsonBinaryData`` subtype 4 for all new GUIDs. 

GuidRepresentationMode
----------------------

In many MongoDB collections, all GUID fields use the same subtype of ``BsonBinaryData``.
Some older collections, however, may contain some GUID fields that 
use subtype 3 and others that use subtype 4. 
To ensure that the driver serializes and deserializes all GUIDs correctly,  
you should set the ``BsonDefaults.GuidRepresentationMode`` property to one of the 
following ``GuidRepresentationMode`` values: 

V2
~~

``GuidRepresentationMode.V2`` assumes that all GUIDs in a document use the same 
``BsonBinaryData`` subtype. In this mode, GUID representation is 
controlled by the reader or writer, not the serializer.

``V2`` is the default ``GuidRepresentationMode``.

.. note::
   
   When version 3 of the {+driver-short+} is released, support for ``GuidRepresentationMode.V2``
   will be removed from the driver and ``V3`` will become the default. 

V3
~~

``GuidRepresentationMode.V3`` allows fields in the same document to use different 
GUID formats. 
In this mode, GUID representation is controlled at the property level by configuring the 
serializer for each property.

To use ``GuidRepresentationMode.V3``, run the following line of code. You should run this 
code during the bootstrapping phase of your application, before creating 
a ``MongoClient`` object. 

.. code-block:: csharp

   BsonDefaults.GuidRepresentationMode = GuidRepresentationMode.V3;

Running in ``V3`` mode changes the behavior of the driver in the following ways:

- The ``BsonBinaryReader.ReadBinaryData()`` method ignores ``readerSettings.GuidRepresentation``
- The ``BsonBinaryWriter.WriteBinaryData()`` method ignores ``writerSettings.GuidRepresentation``
- The ``JsonReader.ReadBinaryData()`` method ignores ``readerSettings.GuidRepresentation``
- ``JsonWriter`` ignores ``writerSettings.GuidRepresentation``
- Calling the ``BsonBinaryData.ToGuid()`` method without the ``GuidRepresentation``
  parameter works only on GUIDs of subtype 4.

.. note::

   You can't use both ``GuidRepresentationMode.V2`` and ``GuidRepresentationMode.V3`` 
   in a single application.

Serializing GUIDs in V3
-----------------------

``GuidRepresentationMode.V3`` handles GUID serialization at the level of individual
properties. This mode is more flexible than ``V2``, but it also means you must ensure that 
each GUID field is serialized and deserialized correctly.

If you're using the {+driver-short+} to :ref:`automap your {+language+} classes to document schemas <csharp-class-mapping>`,
you can use the ``BsonGuidRepresentation`` attribute on a GUID property 
to specify the representation:

.. code-block:: csharp

   public class Widget
   {
       public int Id { get; set; }

      [BsonGuidRepresentation(GuidRepresentation.Standard)]
      public Guid G { get; set; }
   }

.. note::

   ``GuidRepresentation.Standard`` is equivalent to ``BsonBinaryData`` subtype 4.
   Other GUID representations in the {+driver-short+}, such as ``CSharpLegacy``,
   ``JavaLegacy``, and ``PythonLegacy``, are equivalent to subtype 3 but use 
   different byte orders.

If you're writing your own serialization code, you can use the 
``GuidSerializer`` class to serialize and deserialize individual GUID values to and 
from BSON fields. To ensure that the driver handles GUIDs correctly, use the 
``GuidRepresentation`` parameter when you construct a ``GuidSerializer``.

The following code sample creates an instance of ``GuidSerializer`` 
for serializing GUID representations of subtype 4: 

.. code-block::

   var guidSerializer = new GuidSerializer(GuidRepresentation.Standard);

If most of your GUIDs use the same representation, you can register a ``GuidSerializer``
globally. To create and register a ``GuidSerializer``, run the following code early
in your application, such as during the bootstrapping phase:

.. code-block:: csharp

   BsonSerializer.RegisterSerializer(new GuidSerializer(GuidRepresentation.Standard));

.. tip::

   When you're working with two subtypes, you can combine a global serializer with the 
   ``BsonGuidRepresentation`` property attribute. For example, you can register a global
   serializer for the most commonly used GUID subtype, then use the ``BsonGuidRepresentation``
   attribute to denote any GUID properties of another subtype.  

Serializing Objects in V3
-------------------------

You can use an ``ObjectSerializer`` to serialize hierarchical objects to subdocuments. 
To ensure that GUIDs in these objects are serialized and deserialized correctly when using 
``V3``, you should select the correct GUID representation when constructing your 
``ObjectSerializer``. 

The following code sample shows how to 
create an ``ObjectSerializer`` for a GUID representation of subtype 4:

.. code-block:: csharp

   var objectDiscriminatorConvention = BsonSerializer.LookupDiscriminatorConvention(typeof(object));
   var objectSerializer = new ObjectSerializer(objectDiscriminatorConvention, GuidRepresentation.Standard);

If your application relies on an ``ObjectSerializer`` to serialize any GUIDs, you 
must also register the serializer early in your application, such as during the 
bootstrapping phase. The serializer that you 
register will be used globally whenever an object serializer is needed and has not 
been otherwise specified.

To register your ``ObjectSerializer``, pass it to the ``BsonSerializer.RegisterSerializer()``
method:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   var objectDiscriminatorConvention = BsonSerializer.LookupDiscriminatorConvention(typeof(object));
   var objectSerializer = new ObjectSerializer(objectDiscriminatorConvention, GuidRepresentation.Standard);
   BsonSerializer.RegisterSerializer(objectSerializer);
