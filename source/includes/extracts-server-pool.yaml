   Server Pool
   -----------

   |onprem| Server Pool allows |onprem| users with administrative
   privileges, i.e. |onprem| Administrators, to maintain a pool of
   provisioned servers that already have Automation Agents installed.
   When users in a group want to create a new MongoDB deployment, they
   can request servers from this pool to host the MongoDB deployment.

   For details, see :ref:`provision-via-server-pool`.

   The properties file contains key/value pairs of the form
   ``<property>=<value>``. The |onprem| Administrator decides on both the
   property names and values.

   The properties and the values in this file may be presented to the
   user during server request as options when a user requests servers
   from the server pool. That is, the user can request servers that
   match certain properties.

   The |onprem| Administrator determines which properties to display to
   the user in the server request screen. For details, see
   :ref:`server-pool-server-request-options`.

   This setting is usually set when the Automation Agent is
   installed and is required to bind the server to a group.

   .. admonition:: Server Pool 

      Do not set if adding the server to a server pool. To add the
      server to a server pool, set :asetting:`serverPoolKey`,
      :asetting:`serverPoolPropertiesFile`, and
      :asetting:`serverPoolStateFile` instead.
