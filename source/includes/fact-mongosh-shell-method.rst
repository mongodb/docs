.. important:: ``mongosh`` Method

   This is a :mongosh:`mongosh </>` method. This is *not* the
   documentation for ``Node.js`` or other programming language specific
   driver methods.

   In most cases, :mongosh:`mongosh </>` methods work the same way as
   the legacy :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell methods. However, some legacy
   methods are unavailable in ``mongosh``.

   For the legacy :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell documentation, refer to the
   documentation for the corresponding MongoDB Server release:

   - :v4.4:`mongo shell v4.4 </mongo>`
   - :v4.2:`mongo shell v4.2 </mongo>`
   - :v4.0:`mongo shell v4.0 </mongo>`

   For MongoDB API drivers, refer to the language specific
   :driver:`MongoDB driver </>` documentation.
