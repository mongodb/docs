msgid "MongoDB 2.6 includes significant changes to the authorization model, which requires changes to the way that MongoDB stores users' credentials. As a result, in addition to upgrading MongoDB processes, if your deployment uses authentication and authorization, after upgrading all MongoDB process to 2.6 you **must** also upgrade the authorization model."

msgid "Before upgrading the authorization model, you should first upgrade MongoDB binaries to 2.6. For sharded clusters, ensure that **all** cluster components are 2.6. If there are users in any database, be sure you have at least one user in the ``admin`` database with the role :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` **before** upgrading the MongoDB binaries."

#: ../source/includes/fact-auth-upgrade-recommendation.rst:1
msgid "Because downgrades are more difficult after you upgrade the user authorization model, once you upgrade the MongoDB binaries to version 2.6, allow your MongoDB deployment to run a day or two **without** upgrading the user authorization model."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-auth-upgrade-recommendation.rst:6
msgid "This allows 2.6 some time to \"burn in\" and decreases the likelihood of downgrades occurring after the user privilege model upgrade. The user authentication and access control will continue to work as it did in 2.4, **but** it will be impossible to create or modify users or to use user-defined roles until you run the authorization upgrade."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/release-notes/2.6-upgrade-authorization.txt:35
msgid "If you decide to upgrade the user authorization model immediately instead of waiting the recommended \"burn in\" period, then for sharded clusters, you must wait at least 10 seconds after upgrading the sharded clusters to run the authorization upgrade script."
