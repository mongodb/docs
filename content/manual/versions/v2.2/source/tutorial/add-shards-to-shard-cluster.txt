You add shards to a :term:`sharded cluster` after you create the cluster
or anytime that you need to add capacity to the cluster. If you have not
created a sharded cluster, see :ref:`sharding-procedure-setup`.

When adding a shard to a cluster, you should always ensure that the
cluster has enough capacity to support the migration without affecting
legitimate production traffic.

In production environments, all shards should be :term:`replica sets
<replica set>`.

Add a Shard to a Cluster
------------------------

You interact with a sharded cluster by connecting to a :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instance.

1. From a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, connect to the :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   instance. Issue a command using the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo --host <hostname of machine running mongos> --port <port mongos listens on>

   For example, if a :binary:`~bin.mongos` is accessible at
   ``mongos0.example.net`` on port ``27017``, issue the following
   command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo --host mongos0.example.net --port 27017

#. Add each shard to the cluster using the :method:`sh.addShard()`
   method, as shown in the examples below. Issue :method:`sh.addShard()`
   separately for each shard. If the shard is a replica set, specify the
   name of the replica set and specify a member of the set. In
   production deployments, all shards should be replica sets.

   .. optional:: You can instead use the :dbcommand:`addShard` database
      command, which lets you specify a name and maximum size for the
      shard. If you do not specify these, MongoDB automatically assigns
      a name and maximum size. To use the database command, see
      :dbcommand:`addShard`.

   The following are examples of adding a shard with
   :method:`sh.addShard()`:

   - To add a shard for a replica set named ``rs1`` with a member
     running on port ``27017`` on ``mongodb0.example.net``, issue the
     following command:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        sh.addShard( "rs1/mongodb0.example.net:27017" )

     .. versionchanged:: 2.0.3

     For MongoDB versions prior to 2.0.3, you must specify all members of the replica set. For
     example:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        sh.addShard( "rs1/mongodb0.example.net:27017,mongodb1.example.net:27017,mongodb2.example.net:27017" )

   - To add a shard for a standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod` on port ``27017``
     of ``mongodb0.example.net``, issue the following command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.addShard( "mongodb0.example.net:27017" )

   .. note:: It might take some time for :term:`chunks <chunk>` to
      migrate to the new shard.
