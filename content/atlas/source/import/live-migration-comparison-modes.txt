To migrate a {+cluster+} to MongoDB |service| with minimal downtime, you can choose between :ref:`Atlas Live Migration <c2c-pull-live-migration>`
(which hosts mongosync for you) or run standalone |mongosync| directly. Compare both methods to decide which one meets your needs.

   * - Migration Mode
     - :ref:`Atlas Live Migration <c2c-pull-live-migration>`
     - Standalone |mongosync|

   * - Effort required for setting up mongosync
     - **Low:** Fully-managed in |service|-hosted infrastructure.
       Live migration (pull) is currently :ref:`available in these geographic regions<destination-cluster-configuration>`.
     - **High:** Requires self-hosted mongosync infrastructure setup.

   * - Source/Destination cluster locations
     - Source cluster can be either on-premises or in |service|.
  
       Destination cluster **must** exist in |service|.
     - Source cluster can be either on-premises or in |service|.
       
       Destination cluster can be either on-premises or in |service|.
