You can integrate {+avs+} with `LangChain <https://langchain.com/>`__
to build |llm| applications and implement 
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This tutorial demonstrates
how to start using {+avs+} with LangChain. 
In this tutorial, you perform the following actions:

#. Set up the environment.
#. Use |service| to store custom vector data.
#. Create an {+avs+} index on your data.
#. Run the following vector search queries:

   - Similarity search.
   - Similarity search with score.
   - Similarity search with metadata pre-filtering.

#. Implement |rag| by using {+avs+} to answer questions using your data.

Background
----------

LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of 
|llm| applications through the use of "chains." Chains are LangChain-specific
components that can be combined for a variety of AI use cases, including
|rag|. 

By integrating {+avs+} with LangChain, you can use 
|service| as a vector database, use {+avs+} to perform similarity 
search over your data, and implement |rag| by chaining together 
{+avs+} as a retriever. For more context, see :ref:`ai-key-concepts`.

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial, you must have the following:

- An |service| {+cluster+} running MongoDB version 6.0.11, 7.0.2, or later
  (including :abbr:`RCs (Release Candidates)`).

- An OpenAI API Key. You must have a paid OpenAI account with credits
  available for API requests.

- A notebook to run your Python project such as `Colab <https://colab.research.google.com>`__.

Set Up the Environment
----------------------

First, set up the environment for this tutorial by copying 
and pasting the following code snippets into your notebook:

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/langchain-set-up-environment.rst

Use |service| as a Vector Store
-------------------------------

Then, load custom data into |service| and instantiate it as 
an external vector database, also called a `vector store 
<https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/vectorstores/>`__.
Copy and paste the following code snippets into your notebook:

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/langchain-create-vector-store.rst

Create the {+avs+} Index
------------------------------------

To enable vector search queries on your vector store,
create an {+avs+} index on the ``langchain_db.test`` collection.

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an {+avs+} index, you must have :authrole:`Project Data Access 
Admin` or higher access to the |service| project.

Procedure 
~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/langchain-create-index.rst

Run Vector Search Queries
-------------------------

Once |service| has finished building your index, return 
to your notebook and run vector search queries on your data. 
The following examples demonstrate various queries that you can 
run on your vectorized data.

   For a full list of similarity search methods, refer to 
   the `API reference 
   <https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/vectorstores/langchain_community.vectorstores.mongodb_atlas.MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch.html>`__.

Perform Question Answering on Your Data
---------------------------------------

This section demonstrates how you might implement |rag| in your 
application. Now that you've used {+avs+} to retrieve semantically 
similar documents, run the following code in your notebook to create a 
question-answering model that uses these documents as context
for the |llm|. This example does the following:

- Instantiates {+avs+} as a retriever to query for similar documents.
  We include optional parameters to keep only the 10 most relevant
  documents with a relevance score above ``0.75``.
  
- Defines a LangChain prompt template to instruct the |llm| to use 
  these documents as context for your query.
  LangChain passes these documents to the ``{context}`` input
  variable and your query to the ``{question}`` variable.

- Uses the ``RetrievalQA`` chain to create a question-answering 
  model that generates context-aware responses. 
  It specifies the following:

  - OpenAI as the |llm| used to generate the response. 
  - {+avs+} as the retriever used to augment the data set.
  - The boolean value ``true`` to return the source documents
    used as context.
  - The ``stuff`` chain type, which specifies that the relevant 
    documents should be inserted, or "stuffed," into the prompt.
  - The prompt template that you constructed.

- Prompts the |llm| with a sample query about |service| security 
  recommendations. The generated response might vary.
