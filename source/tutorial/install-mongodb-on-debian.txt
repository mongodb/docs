Install MongoDB on Debian
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Use this tutorial to install MongoDB from ``.deb`` packages on the current
**stable** Debian release. While Debian includes its own MongoDB packages, the
official MongoDB packages are more up to date.

.. The following include includes two h2 headers:
.. Packages and Control Scripts

.. |init-script-path| replace:: ``/etc/init.d/mongod``
.. include:: /includes/list-mongodb-org-packages.rst

Considerations
--------------

For production deployments, always run MongoDB on 64-bit systems.

You cannot install this package concurrently with the ``mongodb``,
``mongodb-server``, or ``mongodb-clients`` packages that
your release of Debian may include.

Install MongoDB
---------------

The Debian package management tools (i.e. ``dpkg`` and ``apt``) ensure
package consistency and authenticity by requiring that distributors
sign packages with GPG keys.
