Overview

.. admonition:: new

   Groups are now projects.

In |mms|, MongoDB deployments are associated with projects.

You can create multiple projects in an organization. Each project has
its own Monitoring, Backup and Automation Agents associated with the
project. For a project, the Monitoring Agent must be able to connect to
all hosts it monitors. If you have environments separated by firewalls,
you must create separate |mms| projects for each environment.

Working with Multiple Environments
----------------------------------

If you have multiple MongoDB deployments in distinct environments and
cannot monitor all deployments with a single agent, you will need to
add new projects.

You may also use multiple projects and agents if you want to monitor
separately different MongoDB deployments that run in the same
environment.

Create a Project
----------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a project for an organization, you must be either an
``Organization Owner`` or an ``Organization Project Creator``.

When you create a project, you are added as a ``Project Owner``.

first user to the project and assigns the project a set of default
:doc:`alert configurations </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`.

----------------

.. only:: cloud

   .. important::

      Deleting a project removes all the project's artifacts, including all user
      and monitoring data. |mms| no longer displays the project in selection
      lists.

      You can delete a project if:

      - You have are the :ref:`Owner <owner-role>` for the project or
        have the ``Organization Owner`` role for the project's
        organization.

      - The project has no outstanding invoices.

      - The project has no backups. To terminate your backups prior to removing
        the project, see :ref:`terminate-backup`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. only:: onprem

   Please contact your |mms| administrator to delete a project
   from your |mms| account.

   If you have administrative privileges, you can delete a project through
   system administration. Click :guilabel:`Admin`, then :guilabel:`General`,
   and then :guilabel:`Projects`.
