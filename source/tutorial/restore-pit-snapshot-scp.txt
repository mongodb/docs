To restore a snapshot using ``SCP``, the :term:`Backup Daemon` streams
the snapshot to the target snapshot host.

.. include:: /images/restore-regular-scp.rst

1. The user selects a timestamp:

   - Through the |mms| application:

     1. Click on a timestamp.
     #. Submit their request.

   - Through the :doc:`API </reference/api/restorejobs/get-one-single-restore-job-for-one-cluster>`:

     1. Find the cluster to restore.
     #. :doc:`Create new Restore Job </reference/api/restorejobs/create-one-restore-job-for-one-cluster>`
        for that cluster.

#. |mms| creates a RestoreJob document.

#. The :term:`Backup Daemon` service picks up the RestoreJob document.

#. :term:`Backup Daemon` service starts streaming the :term:`snapshot`
   in the requested format from the Snapshot Store to the target
   snapshot host.

   a. The :term:`Blockstore <Backup Blockstore Database>` streams the
      Blocks that comprise the snapshot through |mms|.
   #. The :term:`S3 Snapshot Store` streams the Blocks that comprise the
      snapshot through |mms|.
   #. The :term:`File System Store` streams the Files that comprise the
      snapshot through |mms|.

#. The user downloads the MongoDB Backup Restore Utility from the |mms|
   application to the target snapshot host.

   .. note::
      The :abbr:`MBRU (MongoDB Backup Restore Utility)` is not unique to
      each restore. If the utility is installed on the host where the
      snapshot will be restored, the user does not need to download it
      again.

#. The user starts a temporary MongoDB instance on the target snapshot
   host. The fetched :term:`oplog` will be applied to the snapshot
   restored to this instance.

#. The :abbr:`MBRU (MongoDB Backup Restore Utility)` fetches the oplog
   for the point-in-time snapshot.

#. The :abbr:`MBRU (MongoDB Backup Restore Utility)` applies the oplog
   to snapshot in the temporary MongoDB instance.

#. The user exports the restored database from the temporary MongoDB
   instance.
