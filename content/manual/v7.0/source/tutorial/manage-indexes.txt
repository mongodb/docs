Remove Indexes
--------------

.. tip:: Hide an Index Before Dropping It

   If you drop an index that is actively used in production, your
   application may incur a performance degradation. Before you drop an
   index, you can evaluate the potential impact of the drop by
   :ref:`hiding the index <hide-existing-index>`.
   
   Hidden indexes are not used to support queries. If you hide an index
   and observe substantial negative performance impact, consider keeping
   and unhiding the index so queries can resume using it.

To learn how to remove an existing index, see :ref:`drop-an-index`.

Modify an Index
---------------

Minimize Performance Impact With a Temporary Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you drop an index that is actively used in production, your
application may incur a performance degradation. To ensure queries can
still use an index during modification, you can create a temporary,
redundant index that contains the same fields as the modified index.

Example
```````

This example creates a new index and modifies that index to make it
:ref:`unique <index-type-unique>`.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create a ``siteAnalytics`` collection with an index on the ``url`` field

      Run this command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.siteAnalytics.createIndex( { "url": 1 } )

      The command returns the name of the index:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

         url_1

   .. step:: Create a temporary index that contains the ``url`` field

      Run this command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.siteAnalytics.createIndex( { "url": 1, "dummyField": 1 } )

      The command returns the name of the index:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

         url_1_dummyField_1

      This temporary index lets you safely drop the original ``{ "url":
      1 }`` index without impacting performance.

   .. step:: Drop the original index

      Run this command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.siteAnalytics.dropIndex( { "url_1" } )

      The command returns:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

         { nIndexesWas: 3, ok: 1 } 

   .. step:: Recreate the ``{ "url": 1 }`` index with the ``unique`` property

       Run this command:

       .. code-block:: javascript

         db.siteAnalytics.createIndex( { "url": 1 }, { "unique": true } )
         
       The command returns the name of the index:

       .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          url_1
         
       The ``url_1`` index is recreated and you can drop the temporary
       index without impacting performance. Queries on the ``url`` field
       can use the new unique index.

   .. step:: Drop the temporary index

      Run this command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.siteAnalytics.dropIndex( { "url_1_dummyField_1" } )

      The command returns:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

         { nIndexesWas: 3, ok: 1 } 

   .. step:: Confirm that the index was updated

      To view the indexes on the ``siteAnalytics`` collection, run this
      command:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.siteAnalytics.getIndexes()

      The command returns these indexes, indicating that the ``url_1``
      index is now unique:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

         [
           { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' },
           { v: 2, key: { url: 1 }, name: 'url_1', unique: true }
         ]

Find Inconsistent Indexes Across Shards
---------------------------------------

A sharded collection has an inconsistent index if the collection does
not have the exact same indexes (including the index options) on each
shard that contains chunks for the collection. Although inconsistent
indexes should not occur during normal operations, inconsistent indexes
can occur, such as:

- When a user is creating an index with a ``unique`` key constraint and
  one shard contains a chunk with duplicate documents. In such cases,
  the create index operation may succeed on the shards without
  duplicates but not on the shard with duplicates.
  
- When a user is creating an index across the shards in a :doc:`rolling
  manner (i.e. manually building the index one by one across the
  shards) </tutorial/build-indexes-on-sharded-clusters>` but either
  fails to build the index for an associated shard or incorrectly
  builds an index with different specification.

The :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>` primary, by default, checks 
for index inconsistencies across the shards for sharded collections, and
the command :dbcommand:`serverStatus`, when run on the config server
primary, returns the field :serverstatus:`shardedIndexConsistency`
field to report on the number of sharded collections with index
inconsistencies.

If :serverstatus:`shardedIndexConsistency` reports any index
inconsistencies, you can run the :dbcommand:`checkMetadataConsistency`
command with ``checkIndexes: true`` for your sharded collections to 
find the inconsistencies.

#. Run the ``checkMetadataConsistency`` command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( {
         checkMetadataConsistency: 1,
         checkIndexes: true
      } )

#. If the collection has inconsistent indexes, the ``checkMetadataConsistency`` 
   command returns details regarding the inconsistent indexes similar to the
   following:

   .. include:: /includes/checkMetadataConsistency-check-indexes-output.rst

   The output indicates two inconsistencies for the sharded
   collection ``test.reviews``:

   #. An index named ``reviewDt_1`` has inconsistent properties across
      the collection's shards, specifically, the ``expireAfterSeconds``
      properties differ.

   #. An index named ``page_1_score_1`` is missing from the collection
      on ``shard02``.

To resolve the inconsistency where an index is missing  from the collection on a particular shard(s),
   You can either:

   - Issue an index build :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` from a
     :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance. The operation only builds the
     collection's index on the shard(s) missing the index.

     \-OR-

   - Perform a :doc:`rolling index build
     </tutorial/build-indexes-on-sharded-clusters>` for the collection
     on the affected shard(s).

     .. note::

        Rolling indexes may negatively impact your deployment. For
        information on when to use this index build, see
        :ref:`rolling-index-build`.

.. include:: /includes/warning-simultaneous-index-builds.rst

To resolve where the index properties differ across the shards, 
   Drop the incorrect index from the collection on the affected
   shard(s) and rebuild the index. To rebuild the index, you can either:

   - Issue an index build :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` from a
     :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance. The operation only builds the
     collection's index on the shard(s) missing the index.

     \-OR-

   - Perform a :doc:`rolling index build
     </tutorial/build-indexes-on-sharded-clusters>` for the collection
     on the affected shard.

     .. note::

        Rolling indexes may negatively impact your deployment. For
        information on when to use this index build, see
        :ref:`rolling-index-build`. 

   Alternatively, if the inconsistency is the ``expireAfterSeconds`` property,
   you can run the :dbcommand:`collMod` command to update the number of
   seconds instead of dropping and rebuilding the index.
