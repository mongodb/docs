To delete snapshots for replica sets and sharded clusters, use the
|mms| console to find then select a backup snapshot to delete.

.. admonition:: Affects next backup and point-in-time restores
   :class: important

   - The next backup job runs as a full backup rather than an
     incremental backup.

   - Point-in-time restores apply oplog entries to the last snapshot
     taken before the specified point. Deleting a snapshot removes the
     base snapshot for a PIT restore.
