journalLatencyTest

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: journalLatencyTest

   :dbcommand:`journalLatencyTest` is an administrative command that tests the
   length of time required to write and perform a file system sync
   (e.g. :term:`fsync`) for a file in the journal directory. 
   You must issue the
   :dbcommand:`journalLatencyTest`
   command against the :term:`admin database` in the form:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript

      { journalLatencyTest: 1 }

   The value (i.e. ``1`` above), does not affect the operation of the
   command.
