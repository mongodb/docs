This tutorial manipulates the :doc:`{+admin-api+}'s </core/api>`
automation configuration to deploy a :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>` that is
owned by another user. The tutorial first creates a new project, then a
new user as owner of the project, and then a sharded cluster owned by
the new user. You can create a script to automate these procedures for
use in routine operations.

To perform these steps, you must have sufficient access to |mms|. A
user with the :authrole:`Global Owner` or
:authrole:`Project Owner` role has sufficient access.

The procedures install a cluster with two :manual:`shards  </reference/glossary/#std-term-shard>`. Each
shard comprises a three-member :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`. The tutorial
installs one |mongos| and three :manual:`config servers  </reference/glossary/#std-term-config-server>`.
Each component of the cluster resides on its own server, requiring a
total of 10 hosts.

The tutorial installs the
:doc:`{+mdbagent+} </tutorial/nav/install-mongodb-agent>` on each
host.

.. _create-cluster-with-api-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

|mms| must have an existing user. If you are deploying the sharded
cluster on a fresh install of |mms|, you must register the first
user.

You must have the |url| of the |onprem| host, as set in the
:ref:`mmsbaseurl <mmsBaseUrl>` setting of the {+mdbagent+} configuration
file.

Provision ten hosts to serve the components of the
:manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`. For host requirements, see the
:manual:`Production Notes </administration/production-notes>` in the
MongoDB manual.

Each host must provide its
:doc:`{+mdbagent+} </tutorial/nav/install-mongodb-agent>` with full
networking access to the hostnames and ports of the {+mdbagent+}s on
all the other hosts. Each agent runs the command ``hostname -f``
to self-identify its hostname and port and report them to |mms|.

.. tip::

   To ensure agents can reach each other,
   :doc:`provision the hosts using Automation </tutorial/add-servers-automation>`.
   This installs the {+mdbagent+}s with correct network access. Use
   this tutorial to reinstall the {+aagent+}s on those machines.

Examples
--------

As you work with the |api|, you can view examples on the
`GitHub example page  <https://github.com/10gen-labs/mms-api-examples/tree/master/automation/>`__.

Variables for Cluster Creation API Resources
--------------------------------------------

The API resources use one or more of these variables. Replace these variables with your desired values before calling these API resources.

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/api-tutorial-substitution-fields.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-public-api-access` to enable you to use the
  API.

- Complete the :doc:`{+mdbagent+} Prerequisites </tutorial/install-mongodb-agent-prereq>`.

Procedures
----------

Create the Group and the User through the API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-group-through-api.rst

Install the {+mdbagent+} on each Provisioned Host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-automation-agent-to-provisioned-servers.rst

Deploy the New Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add or update a deployment, retrieve the
:ref:`configuration <automation-configuration-sample-entity>`, make
changes as needed, and send the updated configuration though the |api|
to |mms|.

The following procedure deploys an updated automation configuration
through the |api|:

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-cluster-through-api.rst

Next Steps
----------

To make an additional version of MongoDB available in the cluster,
see :ref:`update-mongodb-version-of-deployment-via-api`.
