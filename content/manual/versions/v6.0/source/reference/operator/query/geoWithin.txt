.. query:: $geoWithin

   Selects documents with geospatial data that exists entirely
   within a specified shape.

   The specified shape can be either a GeoJSON :ref:`geojson-polygon`
   (either single-ringed or multi-ringed), a GeoJSON
   :ref:`geojson-multipolygon`, or a shape defined by legacy coordinate
   pairs. The :query:`$geoWithin` operator uses the :query:`$geometry`
   operator to specify the :ref:`GeoJSON
   <geospatial-indexes-store-geojson>` object.

   To specify a GeoJSON polygons or multipolygons using the default
   coordinate reference system (CRS), use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         <location field>: {
            $geoWithin: {
               $geometry: {
                  type: <"Polygon" or "MultiPolygon"> ,
                  coordinates: [ <coordinates> ]
               }
            }
         }
      }

   For :query:`$geoWithin` queries that specify GeoJSON geometries with
   areas greater than a single hemisphere, the use of the default CRS
   results in queries for the complementary geometries.

   To specify a single-ringed GeoJSON :ref:`polygon
   <geojson-polygon>` with a custom MongoDB CRS, use the following
   prototype that specifies the custom MongoDB CRS in the
   :query:`$geometry` expression:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         <location field>: {
            $geoWithin: {
               $geometry: {
                 type: "Polygon" ,
                 coordinates: [ <coordinates> ],
                 crs: {
                    type: "name",
                    properties: { name: "urn:x-mongodb:crs:strictwinding:EPSG:4326" }
                 }
               }
            }
         }
      }

   The custom MongoDB CRS uses a counter-clockwise winding order and
   allows :query:`$geoWithin` to support queries with a single-ringed
   GeoJSON :ref:`polygon <geojson-polygon>` whose area is greater than
   or equal to a single hemisphere. If the specified polygon is smaller
   than a single hemisphere, the behavior of :query:`$geoWithin` with
   the MongoDB CRS is the same as with the default CRS. See also
   :ref:`geowithin-big-poly`.

   If querying for inclusion in a shape defined by legacy coordinate
   pairs on a plane, use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         <location field>: {
            $geoWithin: { <shape operator>: <coordinates> }
         }
      }

   The available shape operators are:

   - :query:`$box`,
   - :query:`$polygon`,
   - :query:`$center` (defines a circle), and
   - :query:`$centerSphere` (defines a circle on a sphere).

   .. important::
      If you use longitude and latitude, specify coordinates in order
      of ``longitude, latitude``.

Behavior
--------

Geospatial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:query:`$geoWithin` does not require a geospatial index. However, a
geospatial index will improve query performance. Both :doc:`2dsphere
</core/2dsphere>` and :doc:`2d </core/2d>` geospatial indexes support
:query:`$geoWithin`.

Unsorted Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :query:`$geoWithin` operator does not return sorted results. As
such, MongoDB can return :query:`$geoWithin` queries more quickly than
geospatial :query:`$near` or :query:`$nearSphere` queries, which sort
results.

Degenerate Geometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:query:`$geoWithin` does not guarantee that it will consider a piece of
geometry to contain its component geometry, or another polygon sharing
its component geometry.

Examples
--------

Within a Polygon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example selects all ``loc`` data that exist entirely
within a GeoJSON :ref:`geojson-polygon`. The area of the polygon is
less than the area of a single hemisphere:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find(
      {
        loc: {
          $geoWithin: {
             $geometry: {
                type : "Polygon" ,
                coordinates: [ [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 3, 6 ], [ 6, 1 ], [ 0, 0 ] ] ]
             }
          }
        }
      }
   )

For single-ringed polygons with areas greater than a single hemisphere,
see :ref:`geowithin-big-polygon`.

.. _geowithin-big-polygon:

Within a "Big" Polygon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query with a single-ringed GeoJSON polygon whose area is greater
than a single hemisphere, the :query:`$geometry` expression must
specify the custom MongoDB coordinate reference system. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find(
      {
        loc: {
          $geoWithin: {
             $geometry: {
                type : "Polygon" ,
                coordinates: [
                  [
                    [ -100, 60 ], [ -100, 0 ], [ -100, -60 ], [ 100, -60 ], [ 100, 60 ], [ -100, 60 ]
                  ]
                ],
                crs: {
                   type: "name",
                   properties: { name: "urn:x-mongodb:crs:strictwinding:EPSG:4326" }
                }
             }
          }
        }
      }
   )
