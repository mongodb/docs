Scatter Chart of Award-Nominated Movies with their TomatoMeter Rating
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, add a chart to your dashboard showing the TomatoMeter rating
and :abbr:`MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America)` rating
of movies with the most award nominations. A scatter chart is a good
choice for visualizing how data points clump together around certain
values and allows the representation of several different data
dimensions.
