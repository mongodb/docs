Definition
----------

.. method:: sh.addShard(<url>)

   Adds a shard replica set to a :term:`sharded cluster`. This method
   must be run on a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

   The :method:`sh.addShard()` method has the following parameter:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-sh.addShard-param.rst

   The :method:`sh.addShard()` method has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.addShard("<replica_set>/<hostname><:port>")

   .. warning::

      Do not use ``localhost`` for the hostname unless your
      config server
      is also running on ``localhost``.

      .. |mongodb-package| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongos`
      .. include:: /includes/note-deb-and-rpm-default-to-localhost.rst

The :method:`sh.addShard()` method is a helper for the
:dbcommand:`addShard` command.
The :dbcommand:`addShard` command has additional options which are
not available with this helper.

Example
-------

To add a shard, specify the name of the replica set and
the hostname of at least one member of the replica set, as a seed. If
you specify additional hostnames, all must be members of the same
replica set.

The following example adds a replica set named ``repl0`` and specifies
one member of the replica set:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.addShard("repl0/mongodb3.example.net:27327")
