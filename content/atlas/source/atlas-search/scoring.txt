Every document returned by a |fts| or {+avs+} query is assigned a score based
on relevance, and the documents included in a result set are returned
in order from highest score to lowest. 

Usage
-----

To include the score of each document in your search results,
use the :pipeline:`$project` stage in your aggregation pipeline.

- For the :pipeline:`$search` stage, the ``score`` field 
  takes the :manual:`$meta </reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` expression, 
  which requires the ``searchScore`` value. You can also specify the 
  ``searchScoreDetails`` value for the 
  ``scoreDetails`` field :manual:`$meta </reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` 
  expression for a detailed breakdown of the score. 

- For the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage, the ``score`` field
  takes the :manual:`$meta </reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` expression, 
  which requires the ``vectorSearchScore`` value to return the score of 
  each document in your vector search results. 

.. note:: 

   You can use: 
   
   - ``searchScore`` only in :pipeline:`$search` queries
   - ``vectorSearchScore`` only in :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries
   
   If you use ``searchScore`` and ``vectorSearchScore`` in any other
   query, MongoDB logs a warning starting in MongoDB v8.2.

.. example::

   The following query uses a :pipeline:`$project` stage to add a
   field named ``score`` to the returned documents:

   .. tabs:: 
   
      .. tab:: Search Score 
         :tabid: searchscore

            db.movies.aggregate([

                "$search": {

.. _scoring-behavior:

Behavior
--------

The score assigned to a returned document is part of the document's 
metadata. You can use a :pipeline:`$project` stage in your aggregation
pipeline to include each returned document's score along with the
result set. Documents return from highest score to lowest. 
Many factors can influence a document's score, including
the following:

- Position of the search term in the document.
- Frequency of occurrence of the search term in the document.
- Type of :ref:`operator <fts-operators>` or :ref:`analyzer <analyzers-ref>` 
  a |fts| query uses.

To learn more about the Lucene scoring algorithm, see
`Lucene documentation
<https://lucene.apache.org/core/3_5_0/scoring.html>`__.

Additional Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the default scoring behavior, |fts|
supports the following options:

- :ref:`Modifying <scoring-options>` the score assigned to
  certain documents.
- Returning a detailed breakdown of the score by using the 
  :ref:`score details <fts-score-details>` option.
- :ref:`Normalizing <fts-normalize-score>` the search score.

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If multiple documents in the results have identical scores, 
the ordering of the documents in the results is non-deterministic.
If you want your |fts| results to have a determined order,
include the :ref:`sort <sort-ref>` option in your
:pipeline:`$search` stage to sort the results by a unique field. 
You can use the :ref:`sort <sort-ref>` option to also return an 
ascending sort of the results by score. To learn more, 
see :ref:`sort-ref` and :ref:`Sort by Score Examples <sort-by-score-egs>`.
