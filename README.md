# docs-commandline-tools
This repository contains documentation for the MongoDB Database Tools
(`mongoimport`, `mongoexport`, etc.). Beginning with MongoDB 4.4, the
Database Tools are released separately from the core server package.
Consequently, the MongoDB Database Tools documentation has also been
moved to its own repository, maintained here, and is no longer part of
the core Server Manual from version 4.4 onwards.

The documentation for previous versions of the Database Tools can be
found in the Server Manual repository:

- https://github.com/mongodb/docs

The live documentation for the Database Tools can be found at the
following URL:

- https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/
