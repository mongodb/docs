MMAPv1 Durability Internals (Deprecated)

   :class: singlecol

.. warning::

   The main durability page (not the internals page) is the
   :manual:`Journaling </administration/journaling/>` page.

.. warning::

   The information on this page is deprecated and is accurate for MMAP in MongoDB versions 2.6 and prior.
   
Files
-----

The data file format is unchanged.

Journal files are placed in ``/data/db/journal/``.

Running
-------

Journaling is on by default. Run with ``--nojournal`` to disable
journaling/durable storage. Both :program:`mongod` and ``dbtest`` support
this option.

Declaring Write Intent
----------------------

When writing :program:`mongod` kernel code, one must now declare an
intention to write. Declaration of the intent occurs before the actual
write. See :file:`db/dur.h`. The actual write must occur before
releasing the write lock.

When you do your actual writing, use the pointer that
``dur::writing()`` returns, rather than the original pointer.

.. code-block:: cpp

   Foo *foo;
   getDur().writing(thing)->bar = something;

   int *x;
   getDur().writingInt(x) += 3;

   DiskLoc &loc;
   loc.writing() = newLoc;

   void *p;
   unsigned len;
   memcpy( getDur().writingPtr(p,len), src, len );

Try to declare intent on as small a region as possible to reduce the
amount of information journalled. For example:

.. code-block:: cpp

   BigStruct *b;

   dur::writing(b)->x = 3; // less efficient

   *dur::writing(&b->x) = 3; // more efficient

However, because of overhead for each intent declaration, if many
members of a struct will be written, it may be better to just
declare intent on the whole struct.

Tests
-----

``jstests/dur/`` contains tests for durability.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --nodb jstests/dur/<testname>.js

Administrative
--------------

.. code-block:: sh

   # dump journal entries during any recover, and then start normally
   mongod --journal --durOptions 1

   # recover and terminate
   mongod --journal --durOptions 4

   # dump journal entries (doing nothing else) and then terminate
   mongod --journal --durOptions 7

   # extra checks that everything is correct (slow but good for qa)
   mongod --journal --durOptions 8
