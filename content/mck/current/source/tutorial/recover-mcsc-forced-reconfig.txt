If your deployment has lost a voting majority in any of your shards or config 
server's replica sets, you must `restore from backups <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/backup-and-restore-tools/>`__ to maintain the consistency 
and integrity of your stored data.

.. warning:: 

   The |k8s-op-short| doesn't support forced reconfiguration of a |sharded-cluster| 
   in the event of losing the voting majority. Performing forced reconfiguration 
   might result in severe data loss and leave the sharded cluster in 
   an inconsistent state.
