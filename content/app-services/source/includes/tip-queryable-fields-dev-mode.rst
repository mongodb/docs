.. tip:: Changing Subscriptions with Developer Mode Enabled

   In this tutorial, when you change the subscription and query on
   the priority field for the first time, the field is automatically
   added to the Device Sync :guilabel:`Collection Queryable Fields`.
   This occurs because the template app has Development Mode enabled
   by default. If Development Mode was not enabled, you would have to
   manually add the field as a queryable field to use it in a client-side
   Sync query.

   For more information, refer to :ref:`queryable-fields`.
