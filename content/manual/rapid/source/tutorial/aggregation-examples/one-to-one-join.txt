This tutorial illustrates how to construct an aggregation pipeline,
perform the aggregation on a collection, and display the results using
the language of your choice.

About This Task
---------------

This tutorial demonstrates how to combine data from a collection that
describes product information with another collection that describes
customer orders. The results show a list of all orders placed in 2020
and includes the product details associated with each order.

This aggregation performs a one-to-one join. A one-to-one join occurs
when a document in one collection has a field value that matches a
single document in another collection that has the same field value. The
aggregation matches these documents on the field value and combines
information from both sources into one result.

.. note::

   A one-to-one join does not require the documents to have a one-to-one
   relationship. To learn more about this data relationship,
   see the Wikipedia entry about :wikipedia:`One-to-one (data model)
   <w/index.php?title=One-to-one_(data_model)&oldid=1096960092>`.
