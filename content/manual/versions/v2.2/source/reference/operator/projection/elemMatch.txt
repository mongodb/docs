   The :projection:`$elemMatch` projection operator limits the contents
   of an array field that is included in the query results to contain
   only the array element that matches the :projection:`$elemMatch`
   condition.

   .. note::

      - The elements of the array are documents.

      - If multiple elements match the :projection:`$elemMatch`
        condition, the operator returns the **first** matching element
        in the array.

      - The :projection:`$elemMatch` projection operator is similar to
        the positional :projection:`$` projection operator.

   The examples on the :projection:`$elemMatch` projection operator
   assumes a collection ``school`` with the following documents:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
       _id: 1,
       zipcode: 63109,
       students: [
                    { name: "john", school: 102, age: 10 },
                    { name: "jess", school: 102, age: 11 },
                    { name: "jeff", school: 108, age: 15 }
                 ]
      }
      {
       _id: 2,
       zipcode: 63110,
       students: [
                    { name: "ajax", school: 100, age: 7 },
                    { name: "achilles", school: 100, age: 8 },
                 ]
      }

      {
       _id: 3,
       zipcode: 63109,
       students: [
                    { name: "ajax", school: 100, age: 7 },
                    { name: "achilles", school: 100, age: 8 },
                 ]
      }

      {
       _id: 4,
       zipcode: 63109,
       students: [
                    { name: "barney", school: 102, age: 7 },
                 ]
      }

   .. example::

      The following :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` operation
      queries for all documents where the value of the ``zipcode``
      field is ``63109``. The :projection:`$elemMatch` projection
      returns only the **first** matching element of the ``students``
      array where the ``school`` field has a value of ``102``:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.schools.find( { zipcode: 63109 },
                          { students: { $elemMatch: { school: 102 } } } )

      The operation returns the following documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         { "_id" : 1, "students" : [ { "name" : "john", "school" : 102, "age" : 10 } ] }
         { "_id" : 3 }
         { "_id" : 4, "students" : [ { "name" : "barney", "school" : 102, "age" : 7 } ] }

      - For the document with ``_id`` equal to ``1``, the ``students``
        array contains multiple elements with the ``school`` field
        equal to ``102``. However, the :projection:`$elemMatch`
        projection returns only the first matching element from the
        array.

      - The document with ``_id`` equal to ``3`` does not contain the
        ``students`` field in the result since no element in its
        ``students`` array matched the :projection:`$elemMatch`
        condition.

   The :projection:`$elemMatch` projection can specify criteria on multiple
   fields:

   .. example::

      The following :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` operation
      queries for all documents where the value of the ``zipcode``
      field is ``63109``. The projection includes the **first**
      matching element of the ``students`` array where the ``school``
      field has a value of ``102`` **and** the ``age`` field is greater
      than ``10``:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.schools.find( { zipcode: 63109 },
                          { students: { $elemMatch: { school: 102, age: { $gt: 10} } } } )

      The operation returns the three documents that have ``zipcode`` equal to ``63109``:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         { "_id" : 1, "students" : [ { "name" : "jess", "school" : 102, "age" : 11 } ] }
         { "_id" : 3 }
         { "_id" : 4 }

      Documents with ``_id`` equal to ``3`` and ``_id`` equal to ``4``
      do not contain the ``students`` field since no element matched
      the :projection:`$elemMatch` criteria.

   When the :method:`~db.collection.find()` method includes a
   :method:`~cursor.sort()`, the :method:`~db.collection.find()` method
   applies the :method:`~cursor.sort()` to order the matching documents
   **before** it applies the projection.

   If an array field contains multiple documents with the same field
   name and the :method:`~db.collection.find()` method includes a
   :method:`~cursor.sort()` on that repeating field, the returned
   documents may not reflect the sort order because the
   :method:`~cursor.sort()` was applied to the elements of the array
   before the :projection:`$elemMatch` projection.

   .. example::

      The following query includes a :method:`~cursor.sort()` to order
      by descending ``students.age`` field:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.schools.find(
                          { zipcode: 63109 },
                          { students: { $elemMatch: { school: 102 } } }
                        ).sort( { "students.age": -1 } )

      The operation applies the :method:`~cursor.sort()` to order the
      documents that have the field ``zipcode`` equal to ``63109`` and
      then applies the projection. The operation returns the three
      documents in the following order:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         { "_id" : 1, "students" : [ { "name" : "john", "school" : 102, "age" : 10 } ] }
         { "_id" : 3 }
         { "_id" : 4, "students" : [ { "name" : "barney", "school" : 102, "age" : 7 } ] }
