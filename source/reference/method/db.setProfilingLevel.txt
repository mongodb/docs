.. method:: db.setProfilingLevel(level, slowms)

   Modifies the current :term:`database profiler` level. The database
   profiling system allows administrators to capture data about
   performance.

.. include:: /reference/method/db.setProfilingLevel-param.rst

   The level of profiling can affect performance. It also can allow the
   server to write the contents of queries to the log, which might have
   information security implications for your deployment.

   The following profiling levels are available:

   =========  ==================================
   **Level**  **Setting**
   ---------  ----------------------------------
      0       Off. No profiling.
      1       On. Only includes slow operations.
      2       On. Includes all operations.
   =========  ==================================

   Configure the :setting:`slowms` option to set the threshold
   for the profiler to consider a query "slow." Specify this value in
   milliseconds to override the default.

   This command provides a wrapper around the :term:`database command`
   :dbcommand:`profile`.

   :program:`mongod` writes the output of the database profiler to the
   ``system.profile`` collection.

   :program:`mongod` prints information about queries that take longer than
   the :setting:`slowms` to the log even when the database profiler is
   not active.
