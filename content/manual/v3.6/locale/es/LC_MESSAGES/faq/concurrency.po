"MongoDB allows multiple clients to read and write the same data. In order"
" to ensure consistency, it uses locking and other :term:`concurrency "
"control` measures to prevent multiple clients from modifying the same "
"piece of data simultaneously. Together, these mechanisms guarantee that "
"all writes to a single document occur either in full or not at all and "
"that clients never see an inconsistent view of the data."

"MongoDB uses multi-granularity locking [#mgl-ref]_ that allows operations"
" to lock at the global, database or collection level, and allows for "
"individual storage engines to implement their own concurrency control "
"below the collection level (e.g., at the document-level in WiredTiger)."

"access to a resource, such as a database or collection, but in MMAPv1, "

msgid ""
"In addition to a shared (S) locking mode for reads and an exclusive (X) "
"locking mode for write operations, intent shared (IS) and intent "
"exclusive (IX) modes indicate an intent to read or write a resource using"
" a finer granularity lock.  When locking at a certain granularity, all "
"higher levels are locked using an :term:`intent lock`."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/faq/concurrency.txt:37
msgid ""
"For example, when locking a collection for writing (using mode X), both "
"the corresponding database lock and the global lock must be locked in "
"intent exclusive (IX) mode. A single database can simultaneously be "

"any other modes, and a shared (S) lock can only coexists with intent "
"shared (IS) locks."

"Locks are fair, with reads and writes being queued in order. However, to "
"optimize throughput, when one request is granted, all other compatible "
