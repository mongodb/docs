To perform a :dbcommand:`text` search that also includes additional
query conditions, the :dbcommand:`text` command provides a ``filter``
option. A compound index can support the text search and the ``filter``
condition, such that the operation does not need to scan any documents
to satisfy the filter condition; i.e. the returned :data:`text.stats`
contain ``0`` for the :data:`~text.stats.nscannedObjects` field.

Procedure
---------

To create a ``text`` index that can fulfill the ``filter`` condition of
a :dbcommand:`text` search:

#. Append scalar index fields to a ``text`` index, as in the following
   example which specifies an ascending index key on ``cited``:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :emphasize-lines: 4

      db.quotes.ensureIndex(
         {
           comments: "text",
           cited: 1
         }
      )

#. Use the ``filter`` option in the :dbcommand:`text` to specify an
   condition on the ``cited`` field, as in the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :emphasize-lines: 3-4

      db.quotes.runCommand( "text",
         {
           search: "tomorrow",
           filter: { cited: { $gt: 10 } }
         }
      )

Considerations
--------------

When creating a compound index with that includes the ``text`` index,
you cannot include :ref:`multi-key <index-type-multi-key>` index field
or :ref:`geospatial <index-feature-geospatial>` index field.

With a compound index that includes the ``text`` index and an
ascending/descending key or keys, sort operations do not use the
ascending/descending key from this index; only the text score
determines the sort order.
