=============
MMS -- Backup
=============

The MMS (|mms|) Backup service is an application that creates backups
of MongoDB instances, replica sets, and sharded clusters for
deployments. A small agent runs within your infrastructure that
captures data from your MongoDB deployment using the replication
systems in ``mongod`` instances, while the service hosts the backup
data and snapshots with its own infrastructure.

The Backup MMS service is currently in limited release, and is fully
integrated with the :doc:`MMS Monitoring Service </monitoring>`.

This manual describes the process for registering and activating the
backup service, the process for installing the backup agent, and the
basic procedures for enabling backups and restoring from a backup.
