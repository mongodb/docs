When designing MongoDB systems that utilize MongoDB Search and MongoDB
Vector Search, there are two common deployment types:

- A co-located architecture where ``mongod`` and ``mongot`` processes
  share the same host. This architecture is suitable for development and
  small search or vector search workloads.

- A dedicated infrastructure model where ``mongod`` and ``mongot``
  processes run on separate machines, each sized according to the needs
  of each workload. This infrastructure is recommended for applications
  that demand high availability, sharding, or substantial search or
  vector workloads with heavy search queries and indexing.

This section describes both deployment types. It also describes the
implications of deploying ``mongot`` in sharded MongoDB clusters.

Co-Located Architecture
-----------------------

This is the simplest architecture, recommended for development
environments or any situation that requires quick iteration. It excels
in rapid prototyping and requires the least amount of configuration.

The deployment consists of a single machine running both
``mongod`` and ``mongot`` processes.  All communication can take
place over ``localhost`` addresses, and all authentication and
security features can be disabled or made more permissive.

For most small search workloads, you can expand this architecture to a
multi-node replica set. Use caution when implementing a co-located
architecture, and monitor for signs of resource contention.

Dedicated Infrastructure
------------------------

This is a general-purpose architecture, recommended for production
environments. Dedicated infrastructure accommodates both
horizontal and vertical scalability for both the database nodes
and search nodes.

The deployment consists of at least three machines running ``mongod`` in
a replica set configuration, and at least two machines running
``mongot``.  To provide high availability when querying Search, the
``mongod`` nodes require an application-level load balancer. Consider a
load balancer like Envoy, and use a load balancing strategy such as
per-request round-robin.

No load balancing is required in the opposite direction.
``mongot`` automatically chooses a ``mongod`` node to communicate
with for data replication and the index catalog data based on its
configuration.

.. note::

   **Search Index Storage**
   
   Each ``mongot`` maintains indexes that are built from the data
   continuously sourced from the database. The index definitions
   (metadata) are stored in the database itself.

Sharded Topology
----------------

This architecture is similar to the dedicated infrastructure
architecture, but the replica set configuration is duplicated to
each individual shard.

.. note::
   
   Even though you should only configure ``mongot`` to replicate
   from one shard, ``mongot`` still requires the router address
   to be configured in order to access the index catalog.

With the sharded topology architecture, ``mongot`` only belongs to
a single shard at a time. As a result, load balancers within each
shard should only be configured to direct traffic to that individual shard.

If you add shards to a collection with an existing MongoDB Search
index, an initial sync occurs on the newly added shards for that
MongoDB Search index. Each shard's MongoDB Search index contains
only the documents from the collection that exist on that shard.

.. important::

   **Search Index Storage in Sharded Clusters**
   
   In a sharded cluster, search indexes are distributed across the
   ``mongot`` processes associated with each shard. Consider this when
   planning your backup and recovery policies, as you will need to
   account for both the database data and the search index data stored 
   on each shard's ``mongot`` nodes.

To learn more, see :ref:`shard-global-collection`.

.. warning::

	If you shard a collection that already has a MongoDB Search index,
	you might experience a brief period of incomplete search results
	while the index is building on a shard. 
	
	Also, if you add a shard for an already sharded collection that
	contains a MongoDB Search index, your search queries against that
	collection might return incomplete results until the initial sync
	process  completes on the added shards. To learn more, see
	:ref:`troubleshoot-initial-sync`.
