Overview
--------
 
To access |service|, you must have an |service| user account. If you are
an existing MongoDB Cloud Manager user, you can use your Cloud Manager 
credentials.

To access clusters in a group, users must belong to that group. Users 
can belong to multiple groups.

.. _atlas_roles:

Roles
-----

When you add a user to a group, you also assign either the ``Owner`` or 
``Read-only`` role to the user. The role determines the actions the 
user can perform. You can modify a role for an existing user.  See 
:ref:`atlas_edit_users`.

To assign or edit user roles in a group, you must have the 
:guilabel:`Owner` role in the group. The user who creates a group is 
automatically assigned :guilabel:`Owner` role.

.. important::

   |service| users are separate from MongoDB users. MongoDB users can
   access MongoDB databases, while |service| users can access the
   |service| application itself.

.. _atlas_add_users:

Add Users
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/atlas-users-add.rst

View Users
----------

To view users, click :guilabel:`Users`.

Users are ordered by status. They appear in the following 
sequence:
  1. Users currently in your group.
  #. Users with pending invitations to join your group.
  #. Users requesting to join your group.

A user can request to join a group when first registering for |service|.

View Invitations
----------------

When you invite a user to join a group, if the user exists in |service|
they are added to the group automatically. If the user does not exist in
|service|, |service| sends an email invitation to join the group.

To view any unaccepted invitations, click :guilabel:`Users`. The 
invitee's role appears as *--invite sent--*. To cancel an 
invitation, click :guilabel:`Cancel Invite`.

Remove Users
------------

.. important::

   You cannot delete the last user in a group. You must instead 
   :ref:`close the group <how-do-i-remove-my-company-group>`.
    
   You cannot delete the last :guilabel:`Owner` remaining in the group. 
   You must first assign the role to at least one other user before 
   deleting the original user.
