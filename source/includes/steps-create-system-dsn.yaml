  The following form fields are required:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 30 70

     * - Field Name
       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`Data Source Name`
       - A name of your choice.

     * - :guilabel:`TCP/IP Server`
       - The hostname specified in the |service| connect dialog.

     * - :guilabel:`Port`
       - The :abbr:`IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)`
         `port number <https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml>`_
         specified in the |service| connect dialog. The default is
         ``27015``.

     * - :guilabel:`Database`
       - The name of the database to which you want to connect.

     * - :guilabel:`User`
       - Enter either the user specified in the |service| connect dialog
         or another database user with access to the database.

         The user is specified in the following format:

         .. code-block:: shell

             <username>?source=<database-name>

         where the ``<database-name>`` is the authentication database
         for the user. If ``admin`` is the authentication database,
         you can omit ``?source=<database-name>``.

         - If you are using Username and Password (``SCRAM-SHA-1``)
           authentication, the expected authenticating database is
           ``admin``.
  
         - If you are using LDAP (``PLAIN``) authentication, the
           expected authenticating database is ``$external``:

           .. example::

              myTestUser?source=$external    

     * - :guilabel:`Password`
       - The password that corresponds to the specified ``User``.

  the database named in the connection.
