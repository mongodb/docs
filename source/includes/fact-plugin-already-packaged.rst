.. note::

   This plugin is already packaged with |compass|, so following
   this tutorial and creating this plugin will not change Compass' visual
   contents. The source code for this plugin is maintained internally
   by the |compass| development team.

   This tutorial illustrates how to create and display a
   :ref:`header item <plugin-ref-header-items>` in |compass| so you can
   employ a similar approach when adding your own header items.
