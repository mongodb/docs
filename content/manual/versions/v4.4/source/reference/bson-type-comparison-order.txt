Comparison/Sort Order

.. note::

   :ref:`$range <range>` query and aggregation operators perform
   comparisons only on fields where the :ref:`BSON type
   <bson-types>` matches the query value's type. MongoDB supports
   limited cross-BSON comparison through :ref:`type-bracketing`.

Numeric Types
-------------

MongoDB treats some types as equivalent for comparison purposes. For
instance, numeric types undergo conversion before comparison.

Strings
-------

Binary Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, MongoDB uses the simple binary comparison to compare
strings.

.. _collation:

Collation
~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-versionadded.rst


Collation specification has the following syntax:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-document.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-unspecified.rst

Arrays
------

With arrays, a less-than comparison or an ascending sort compares the
smallest element of arrays, and a greater-than comparison or a
descending sort compares the largest element of the arrays. As such,
when comparing a field whose value is a single-element array (e.g. ``[
1 ]``) with non-array fields (e.g. ``2``), the comparison is between
``1`` and ``2``. A comparison of an empty array (e.g. ``[ ]``) treats
the empty array as less than ``null`` or a missing field.

Objects
-------

MongoDB's comparison of :term:`BSON` objects uses the following order:

#. Recursively compare key-value pairs in the order that they appear
   within the BSON object.

#. Compare the field types. MongoDB uses the following comparison
   order for field types, from lowest to highest:

   a. MinKey (internal type)
   #. Null
   #. Numbers (ints, longs, doubles, decimals)
   #. Symbol, String
   #. Object
   #. Array
   #. BinData
   #. ObjectId
   #. Boolean
   #. Date
   #. Timestamp
   #. Regular Expression
   #. MaxKey (internal type)

#. If the field types are equal, compare the
   :ref:`key field names <document-field-names>`.

#. If the key field names are equal, compare the field values.

#. If the field values are equal, compare the next key/value pair
   (return to step 1). An object without further pairs is less than an
   object with further pairs.


Dates and Timestamps
--------------------

Date objects sort before Timestamp objects.

Non-existent Fields
-------------------

The comparison treats a non-existent field as if it were an empty BSON
Object. As such, a sort on the ``a`` field in documents ``{ }`` and ``{
a: null }`` would treat the documents as equivalent in sort order.

BinData
-------

MongoDB sorts ``BinData`` in the following order:

#. First, the length or size of the data.

#. Then, by the BSON one-byte subtype.

#. Finally, by the data, performing a byte-by-byte comparison.
