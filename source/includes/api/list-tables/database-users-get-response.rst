         certificates, |ldap|, or AWS IAM.
       - ``admin`` users authenticated using
         :manual:`SCRAM-SHA </core/security-scram>`.

         This is the default authentication scheme in |service|. 

   * - ``deleteAfterDate``
     - string
     - |iso8601-time| after which |service| deletes the user. This
       field is only present if an expiration date was specified

          * - ``NONE``
            - |service| authenticates this user through

          * - ``USER``
            - |ldap| server authenticates this user through the user's
              |ldap| user.
          * - ``GROUP``
            - |ldap| server authenticates this user using their
              |ldap| user and authorizes this user using their |ldap|
              group. To learn more about |ldap| security, see
              :doc:`/security-ldaps`.

   * - ``x509Type``
     - string
     - X.509 method by which the provided ``username`` is
       authenticated. If no value is given, |service| uses the default

          * - ``MANAGED``
            - The user is being created for use with |service|-managed 
              X.509. 
              
              Externally authenticated users can only be created on the 
              ``$external`` database.

          * - ``CUSTOMER``
            - The user is being created for use with 
              :ref:`Self-Managed X.509 <self-managed-x509>`. Users 
              created with this ``x509Type`` require a 
              Common Name (CN) in the ``username`` field. To learn more,
              see `RFC 2253 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2253>`_.
