===================================
Configure a Secondary's Sync Target
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Secondaries capture data from the primary member to maintain an up to date
copy of the sets' data. However, by default secondaries may automatically
change their sync targets to secondary members based on changes in the
ping time between members and the state of other membersâ€™ replication. See
:doc:`/core/replica-set-sync` and
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-chained-replication` for more information.

For some deployments, implementing a custom replication sync topology may
be more effective than the default sync target selection logic. MongoDB
provides the ability to specify a host to use as a sync target.

To override the default sync target selection logic, you may manually
configure a :term:`secondary` member's sync target to temporarily pull
:term:`oplog` entries. The following provide access to this functionality:

- :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` command, or

- :method:`rs.syncFrom()` helper in the :program:`mongo` shell

Considerations
--------------

Sync Logic
~~~~~~~~~~

Only modify the default sync logic as needed, and always exercise
caution.  :method:`rs.syncFrom()` will not affect an in-progress
initial sync operation. To affect the sync target for the initial sync, run
:method:`rs.syncFrom()` operation *before* initial sync.

If you run :method:`rs.syncFrom()` during initial sync, MongoDB
produces no error messages, but the sync target will not change until
after the initial sync operation.

Procedure
---------

To use the :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` command in the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { replSetSyncFrom: "hostname<:port>" } )

To use the :method:`rs.syncFrom()` helper in the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.syncFrom("hostname<:port>")

.. slave-ok, admin-only
