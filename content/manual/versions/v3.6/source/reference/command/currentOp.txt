Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: currentOp

   .. |command| replace:: currentOp

   Returns a :term:`document` that contains information on in-progress
   operations for the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. 

   :dbcommand:`currentOp` has the following form:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript

      { currentOp: 1 }

   The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the :method:`db.currentOp()`
   wrapper for the :dbcommand:`currentOp` command.

Behavior
--------

:dbcommand:`currentOp` must run against the ``admin`` database, and
it can accept several optional fields.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85
   
   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``"$ownOps"``

     - Boolean. If set to ``true``, returns information on the current user's
       operations only.

       On :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, users are always authorized to run
       :dbcommand:`currentOp` with ``"$ownOps": true`` to view their own
       operations. See :ref:`access control <currentOp-access-control>`.

       .. versionadded:: 3.2.9

   * - ``"$all"``

     - Boolean. If set to ``true``, returns information on all operations,
       including operations on idle connections and system operations.

       ``"$all": true`` overrides any output field filters.

   * - <filter>

     - Specify filter conditions on the :ref:`currentOp-output-fields`.
       See :ref:`currentOp-examples`.

:dbcommand:`currentOp` and the
:doc:`database profiler</reference/database-profiler>` report the same
basic diagnostic information for all CRUD operations, including the
following:
 
.. include:: /includes/fact-diagnostic-info.rst

.. _currentOp-access-control:

Access Control
--------------

On systems running with :setting:`~security.authorization`, the user
must have access that includes the :authaction:`inprog` privilege
action.

Starting in 3.2.9, users can use
``$ownOps`` on :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances to view their own
operations without the :authaction:`inprog` privilege action.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { currentOp: 1, "$ownOps": 1 } )

.. seealso::  :ref:`create-role-to-manage-ops`

.. _currentOp-examples:

Examples
--------

The following examples use the :dbcommand:`currentOp` command with
various query documents to filter the output.

Display All Current Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand(
      {
        currentOp: true,
        "$all": true
      }
   )

.. NOTE TO WRITERS: If you're editing the following examples, make
   sure that you also update the examples on db.currentOp (the equiv. 
   method). Single sourcing is weird due to diffs in code block. - ARM

Write Operations Waiting for a Lock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example returns information on all write operations that
are waiting for a lock:

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand(
      {
        currentOp: true,
        "waitingForLock" : true,
        $or: [
           { "op" : { "$in" : [ "insert", "update", "remove" ] } },
           { "command.findandmodify": { $exists: true } }
       ]  
      }
   )

Active Operations with no Yields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example returns information on all active running
operations that have never yielded:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand(
      {
        currentOp: true,
        "active" : true,
        "numYields" : 0,
        "waitingForLock" : false
      }
   )

Active Operations on a Specific Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example returns information on all active operations for
database ``db1`` that have been running longer than 3 seconds:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand(
      {
        currentOp: true,
        "active" : true,
        "secs_running" : { "$gt" : 3 },
        "ns" : /^db1\./
      }
   )

.. _currentOp-cmd-index-creation:

Active Indexing Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

The following example returns information on index creation operations:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand(
       {
         currentOp: true,
         $or: [
           { op: "command", "command.createIndexes": { $exists: true }  },
           { op: "none", "msg" : /^Index Build/ }
         ]
       }
   )



Output Example
--------------

.. include:: /includes/currentOp-output-example.rst

.. _currentOp-output-fields:

Output Fields
-------------

.. data:: currentOp.desc

   A description of the client. This string includes the
   :data:`~currentOp.connectionId`.

.. data:: currentOp.connectionId

   An identifier for the connection where the operation originated.

.. data:: currentOp.client

   A string with information about where the operation originated.

.. data:: currentOp.appName

   A string with information about the type of client which made the
   request.

.. data:: currentOp.opid

   The identifier for the operation. You can pass this value to
   :method:`db.killOp()` in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to terminate the
   operation.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/warning-terminating-ops-method.rst

.. data:: currentOp.active

   A boolean value specifying whether the operation has started. Value
   is ``true`` if the operation has started or ``false`` if the
   operation is idle, such as an idle connection or an internal thread
   that is currently idle. An operation can be active even if the
   operation has yielded to another operation.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

      For some inactive background threads, such as an inactive
      ``signalProcessingThread``, MongoDB suppresses various empty
      fields.

.. data:: currentOp.secs_running

   The duration of the operation in seconds. MongoDB calculates this
   value by subtracting the current time from the start time of the
   operation.

   Only appears if the operation is running; i.e. if
   :data:`~currentOp.active` is ``true``.

.. data:: currentOp.microsecs_running

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   The duration of the operation in microseconds. MongoDB calculates this
   value by subtracting the current time from the start time of the
   operation.

   Only appears if the operation is running; i.e. if
   :data:`~currentOp.active` is ``true``.

.. data:: currentOp.op

   A string that identifies the type of operation. The possible values
   are:

   - ``"none"``
   - ``"update"``
   - ``"insert"``
   - ``"query"``
   - ``"command"``
   - ``"getmore"``
   - ``"remove"``
   - ``"killcursors"``

   ``"query"`` operations include read operations.

   ``"command"`` operations include most 
   :doc:`commands </reference/command>` such as the
   :dbcommand:`createIndexes` and :dbcommand:`findandmodify`.

.. data:: currentOp.ns

   The :term:`namespace` the operation targets. A namespace consists of
   the :term:`database` name and the :term:`collection` name
   concatenated with a dot (``.``); that is,
   ``"<database>.<collection>"``.

.. data:: currentOp.command

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/command-field-currentOp.rst

.. data:: currentOp.originatingCommand

   .. include:: /includes/fact-originating-command-ref.rst

.. data:: currentOp.planSummary

   A string that contains the query plan to help debug slow queries.

.. data:: currentOp.client

   The IP address (or hostname) and the ephemeral port of the client
   connection where the operation originates. If your ``inprog``
   array has operations from many different clients, use this string
   to relate operations to clients.

.. data:: currentOp.appName

   .. include:: /includes/fact-client-appname.rst

.. data:: currentOp.locks

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

   The :data:`~currentOp.locks` document reports the type and mode of
   locks the operation currently holds. The possible lock types are as
   follows:

   .. include:: /includes/fact-lock-types.rst

   The possible modes are as follows:

   .. include:: /includes/fact-lock-modes.rst

.. data:: currentOp.waitingForLock

   Returns a boolean value. :data:`~currentOp.waitingForLock` is ``true`` if the
   operation is waiting for a lock and ``false`` if the operation has
   the required lock.

.. data:: currentOp.msg

   The :data:`~currentOp.msg` provides a message that describes the status and
   progress of the operation. In the case of indexing or mapReduce
   operations, the field reports the completion percentage.

.. data:: currentOp.progress

   Reports on the progress of mapReduce or indexing operations. The
   :data:`~currentOp.progress` fields corresponds to the completion percentage in
   the :data:`~currentOp.msg` field. The :data:`~currentOp.progress` specifies the following
   information:

   .. data:: currentOp.progress.done

      Reports the number completed.

   .. data:: currentOp.progress.total

      Reports the total number.

.. data:: currentOp.killPending

   Returns ``true`` if the operation is currently flagged for
   termination.  When the operation encounters its next safe termination point, the
   operation will terminate.

.. data:: currentOp.numYields

   :data:`~currentOp.numYields` is a counter that reports the number of times the
   operation has yielded to allow other operations to complete.

   Typically, operations yield when they need access to data that
   MongoDB has not yet fully read into memory. This allows
   other operations that have data in memory to complete quickly
   while MongoDB reads in data for the yielding operation.

.. data:: currentOp.fsyncLock

   Specifies if database is currently locked for :method:`fsync
   write/snapshot <db.fsyncLock()>`.

   Only appears if locked; i.e. if :data:`~currentOp.fsyncLock` is
   ``true``.

.. data:: currentOp.info

   Information regarding how to unlock database from
   :method:`db.fsyncLock()`. Only appears if
   :data:`~currentOp.fsyncLock` is ``true``.

.. data:: currentOp.lockStats

   For each lock type and mode (see :data:`currentOp.locks` for
   descriptions of lock types and modes), returns the following
   information:

   .. COMMENT
      these definitions are for per operations and not for server,
      as such, they differ from those in serverStatus.txt

   .. data:: currentOp.lockStats.acquireCount

      Number of times the operation acquired the lock in the specified
      mode.

   .. data:: currentOp.lockStats.acquireWaitCount

      Number of times the operation had to wait for the
      :data:`~currentOp.lockStats.acquireCount` lock acquisitions
      because the locks were held in a conflicting mode.
      :data:`~currentOp.lockStats.acquireWaitCount` is less than or
      equal to :data:`~currentOp.lockStats.acquireCount`.

   .. data:: currentOp.lockStats.timeAcquiringMicros

      Cumulative time in microseconds that the operation had to wait to
      acquire the locks.

      :data:`~currentOp.lockStats.timeAcquiringMicros` divided by
      :data:`~currentOp.lockStats.acquireWaitCount` gives an
      approximate average wait time for the particular lock mode.

   .. data:: currentOp.lockStats.deadlockCount

      Number of times the operation encountered deadlocks while waiting
      for lock acquisitions.
