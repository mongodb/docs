TTL indexes are special indexes that MongoDB can use to automatically
remove documents from a collection after a certain amount of
time. This is ideal for some types of information like machine
generated event data, logs, and session information that only need to
persist in a database for a limited amount of time.

Considerations
--------------

TTL indexes have the following limitations:

- :ref:`Compound indexes <index-type-compound>` are *not* supported.

- The indexed field **must** be a date :term:`type <bson types>`.

- If the field holds an array, and there are multiple date-typed data
  in the index, the document will expire when the *lowest*
  (i.e. earliest) matches the expiration threshold.

In all other respects, TTL indexes are normal indexes,
and if appropriate, MongoDB can use these
indexes to fulfill arbitrary queries.
