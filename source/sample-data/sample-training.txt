The ``sample_training`` database contains a set of realistic data used in
`MongoDB Private Training Offerings`_.
This dataset is based on public available data sources such as:

- `Crunchbase Data`_,
- `NYC OpenData`_,
- `Open Flights`_ and
- `Citibike Data`_.


These realistic datasets are used by our students to explore MongoDB's
functionality across our private training labs and exercises.
