  Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the latest
  release in the |oldversion| series. If using a package manager, add a new
  repository for the |oldversion| binaries, then perform the actual downgrade
  process.

  Downgrade each :term:`secondary` member of the replica set, one at a
  time:

  a. :ref:`Perform a clean shut down <terminate-mongod-processes>`
     of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process.

     .. include:: /includes/note-clean-shutdown.rst

  #. Replace the |newversion| binary with the |oldversion| binary.

  #. Start the |oldversion| :binary:`~bin.mongod` process.

  #. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state
     before downgrading the next secondary. To check the member's 
     state, use the :method:`rs.status()` method in the 
     :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

  Use :method:`rs.stepDown()` in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to
  step down the :term:`primary` and force the normal :ref:`failover
  <replica-set-failover>` procedure.
action:
  language: javascript
  code:
    rs.stepDown()
post: |
  :method:`rs.stepDown()` expedites the failover procedure and is
  preferable to shutting down the primary directly.

  When :method:`rs.status()` shows that the primary has stepped down
  and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, 
  :ref:`perform a clean shut down <terminate-mongod-processes>` of the
  previous primary and replace the :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with
  the |oldversion| binary and start the new process.
