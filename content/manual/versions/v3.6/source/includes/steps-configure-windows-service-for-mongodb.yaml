title: Install the MongoDB service.
stepnum: 3
level: 4
ref: mongodb-service
content: |

  Install the MongoDB service by starting :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe`
  with the ``--install`` option and the ``-config``
  option to specify the previously created configuration file.

  .. code-block::

     "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin\mongod.exe" ^
        --config "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\mongod.cfg" ^
        --install

  To use an alternate :setting:`dbpath`, specify the path in the
  configuration file (e.g. ``C:\mongodb\mongod.cfg``) or
  on the command line with the :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` 
  option.

  .. note::

     You can install services for multiple instances of 
     :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` or :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` on a 
     single host. Install each service with a unique 
     :option:`--serviceName <mongod.exe --serviceName>` and 
     :option:`--serviceDisplayName <mongod.exe --serviceDisplayName>`. 
     Use multiple instances only when sufficient system resources 
     exist and your system design requires it.

  Verify that MongoDB has started successfully by checking the
  log file at ``c:\data\log\mongod.log`` for the following line:

  If you modified the :setting:`systemLog.path`
  configuration file option, open the log file at that location to
  examine the process output.

  You may see non-critical warnings in the process
  output. As long as you see the log line shown above, you can safely
  ignore these warnings during your initial evaluation of MongoDB.
