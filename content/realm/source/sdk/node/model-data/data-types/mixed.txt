Mixed - Node.js SDK
===================

.. versionchanged:: 12.9.0

    Mixed properties can contain lists or dictionaries of mixed data.

.. versionadded:: 10.5.0

The mixed data type is a realm property type that can hold any valid Realm data
type except an embedded object or a set.
You can create collections (lists, sets, and dictionaries) of type ``mixed``. Properties using the mixed data type can also hold null values.

.. note::

   The mixed data type is indexable, but you can't use it as a primary key.
   Because null is a permitted value, you can't declare a Mixed property as
   optional.

Realm Object Models
-------------------
To :ref:`set a property of your object model
<node-define-a-realm-object-schema>` as mixed, set the property's type to
"``mixed``".

Create an Object With a Mixed Value
-----------------------------------
Create an object with a mixed value by running the :js-sdk:`realm.create()
<classes/Realm-1.html#create>` method within a write transaction.

Collections as Mixed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In SDK v12.9.0 and later, a mixed data type can hold collections (a list or
dictionary, but *not* a set) of mixed elements. You can use mixed collections to
model unstructured or variable data. For more information, refer to
:ref:`<node-model-unstructured-data>`.

- You can nest mixed collections up to 100 levels.
- You can query mixed collection properties and
  :ref:`register a listener for changes <node-collection-listener>`, as you
  would a normal collection.

- You can find and update individual mixed collection elements
- You *cannot* store sets or embedded objects in mixed collections.

To use mixed collections, define the mixed type property in your data model.
Then, create the list or dictionary collection.

Query for Objects with a Mixed Value
------------------------------------
Query for objects with a mixed value by running the
:js-sdk:`Collection.filtered() <classes/OrderedCollection.html#filtered>`
method and passing in a :ref:`filter <node-filter-queries>` for a non-mixed
field. You can then print the value of the mixed property or the entire
object itself.
