|mms| supports shutting down individual |mongod| and |mongos|
processes, as well as :term:`replica sets <replica set>` and
:term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`. When you shut down a
process, cluster, or replica set, |mms| continues to manage it.

After the process shuts down, you can
:doc:`restart </tutorial/restart-deployment>` or
:doc:`remove </tutorial/unmanage-deployment>` your processes.

.. admonition:: No Alert Raised if User Shuts Down a MongoDB Process
   :class: note
