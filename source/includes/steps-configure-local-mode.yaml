     :guilabel:`Ops Manager Config`.

  #. Click the :guilabel:`Miscellaneous` tab at the top of the page.

  #. Scroll to the :guilabel:`MongoDB Version Management` heading.

  #. Select the following settings:

        * - Option
          - Action

        * - :guilabel:`Agents get the installers from:` under
            :guilabel:`Installer Download Source`

          - Select :guilabel:`Ops Manager Application Server`.

            All necessary installers are downloaded from |onprem|
            Application Servers. Agent hosts do not need an internet
            connection.

        * - :guilabel:`Ops Manager gets installers from:` under
            :guilabel:`Installer Download Source`
          - Select
            :guilabel:`Ops Manager Application Server Hard Drive`.

            An |onprem| administrator provides installers from the
            MongoDB Download Center into the
            :term:`versions directory`. |onprem| serves them to Agent
            hosts. The Version Manifest must be
            :doc:`updated manually </tutorial/update-version-manifest>`.
            No hosts in the deployment require an internet connection.

            .. note::

               This option appears if :guilabel:`Agents get the
               installers from:` is set to :guilabel:`Ops Manager
               Application Server`.

        * - :guilabel:`Versions Directory`
          - Leave this value to the plaform default unless you need to
            change to meet a requirement for your environment.

            The default locations for the :setting:`Versions Directory`
            depend on your |onprem| host platform:

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1
               :widths: 30 70

               * - Windows
                 - ``C:\MMSData\MongoDBReleases``

            The |application| expects the MongoDB binaries to be
            stored in this directory on every |onprem| host.

        * - :guilabel:`Backup Versions Auto Download`
          - Select ``true`` unless your :term:`Backup Daemon` and
            |application| run on different platforms (chip
            architectures, operating systems, or operating system
            versions). If they run on separate platforms, select
            ``false``.

            .. admonition:: MongoDB version for Backup Daemon and |onprem| must be same platform
               :class: warning

               If the Agents and the :term:`Backup Daemon` run on a
               "mixed environment" of different host platforms, you
               must manage the installation and upgrade of the MongoDB
               version for the Backup Daemon manually. If the Backup
               Daemon manages downloading and extracting the MongoDB
               version for the :term:`head database`, it could try to
               install or upgrade an incompatible binary in a mixed
               environment.

        * - :guilabel:`Backup Versions Auto Download Enterprise Builds`
          - Select ``true`` if you want the Backup Daemon to download
            MongoDB Enterprise builds as well as MongoDB Community
            builds.

        * - :guilabel:`Required Module for Backup`
          - Select which build of MongoDB you want the
            :term:`Backup Daemon` to use for the :term:`head database`.

title: "Download the required MongoDB archives."
stepnum: 2
ref: download-binaries
content: |
  
   Using a computer connected to the Internet, go to the MongoDB
   `Download Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center>`_
   and download the MongoDB binary archives for the appropriate
   platforms and versions.

   Binaries are stored as compressed archives (``.tgz`` for macOS or
   Linux and ``.zip`` for Windows).

   .. admonition:: Downloading Archives with Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge Browsers
      :class: note

      If you download a binary archive using Microsoft Internet
      Explorer or Edge, the archive downloads with a ``.gz`` extension
      instead of a ``.tgz`` extension. You must change this file
      extension to ``.tgz`` before continuing.

   To review which versions you require, see
   :ref:`local-mode-determine-versions`.
  
   **To download a Community Edition:**
  
   a. Go to the `Community Server
      <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community>`_ tab in the
      Download Center.

   #. Click on the tab for the desired platform.

   #. In the :guilabel:`Version` list, click the desired platform
      version.

   #. To download the latest stable version, click
      :guilabel:`Download`.
  
      For the current stable version, click the :guilabel:`Download`
      button and in the dialog that appears, click on the
      :guilabel:`archive` link.

   #. To download the older versions, click
      :guilabel:`All Version Binaries`.

   #. Download the **archive file** for each MongoDB host platform
      that |onprem| manages.

   **To download an Enterprise Edition:**

   a. Go to the `Enterprise Server
      <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#enterprise>`_ tab in the
      Download Center.

   #. Click on the tab for the desired platform.

   #. In the :guilabel:`Version` list, click the desired platform
      version.

   #. To download the latest stable version, click
      :guilabel:`Download`.
  
      For the current stable version, click the :guilabel:`Download`
      button and in the dialog that appears, click on the
      :guilabel:`archive` link.

   #. To download the older versions, click
      :guilabel:`Archived Releases`.

      For each platform and MongoDB version you want to download,
      click the link to the right of the :guilabel:`Archive` label.

title: "Populate all |onprem| hosts with the necessary MongoDB binaries and archives."
stepnum: 3
ref: populate-with-binaries
content: |

  On *all* your |onprem| hosts, including those with enabled Backup
  Daemons, you must copy all of the archived binaries to the directory
  specified in the :setting:`Versions Directory <versions-directory>`.
  This directory stores all of the MongoDB archived and extracted
  binaries that |onprem| needs to install and upgrade MongoDB
  deployments and :term:`head databases <head database>`.

  .. topic:: Optional: Extract MongoDB binaries on Backup Daemon host
 
     .. important::

        Skip these steps if you set
        :ref:`Backup Version Auto Download <mongodb-release-autodownload>`
        to ``true``.

     a. Login to the |onprem| host that runs the Backup Daemon.

     b. Change to the :setting:`Versions Directory <versions-directory>`
        into which you copied the archived binaries.

        .. code-block:: sh

           cd /opt/mongodb/mms/mongodb-releases

     c. Extract all of the archived binaries needed for
        |onprem|\'s :term:`Backup Daemon`. When extracted, the archive
        creates a subdirectory that uses the following naming convention:

        ``mongodb-<platform>-<chip-architecture>-(edition)-<platform-version>-<mongodb-version``

        .. example::

           .. code-block:: sh

              mongodb-linux-x86_64-enterprise-suse11-3.6.2.tgz

     The extracted binaries must match the Backup Daemon's
     platform and must be the latest in the series for each MongoDB
     version in your deployments.

     .. example::

        If the MongoDB version of your deployment is ``v3.6``,
        latest in the series would be ``3.6.x`` where ``x`` is the
        latest revision version number.

title: "Ensure that the |mms| Linux user can read files in the Versions Directory. (Linux only)"
stepnum: 4
ref: mongodb-mms-as-owner
content: |

  On a Linux platform, the ``mongodb-mms`` user needs the read
  permissions to the :setting:`Versions Directory <versions-directory>`.

  a. Change ownership of all files and  directories in the Versions
     Directory to ``mongodb-mms``.

     .. code-block:: sh
        :class: copyable-code

        sudo chown -R mongodb-mms:mongodb-mms <path-to-the-versions-directory>/*

  b. Change permissions on all the files under the
     Versions Directory to allow the:

     - **Owner** to read and write them
     - **Group** to read them

     When you set these permissions, |onprem| can read and extract the
     archived binaries. Do not remove the execute permission from any
     directories under the
     :setting:`Versions Directory <versions-directory>`. If you did, the
     :term:`Backup Daemon` cannot access any files inside those
     directories.

     .. code-block:: sh
        :class: copyable-code

        sudo chmod -R 640 <path-to-the-versions-directory>/*.tgz \
          <path-to-the-versions-directory>/*.zip

  If these steps were successful, the resulting list of the
  :setting:`Versions Directory <versions-directory>` should look
  something like this:
 
  .. code-block:: sh

     -rw-r----- 1 mongodb-mms mongodb-mms 116513825 Apr 27 15:06 mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.6.9.tgz
