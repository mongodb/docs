Definition
~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`$lookup <streams-agg-pipeline-lookup>` stage performs a left outer
join of the stream of messages from your :pipeline:`$source` to an
{+service+} collection in your :ref:`Connection Registry <atlas-sp-manage-connections>`.

Depending on your use case, a ``$lookup`` pipeline stage uses one of 
the following three syntaxes:

- :manual:`Equality Match with a Single Join Collection 
  </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#equality-match-with-a-single-join-collection>`
- :manual:`Join Conditions and Subqueries on a Joined Collection
  </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#join-conditions-and-subqueries-on-a-joined-collection>`
- :manual:`Correlated Subqueries Using Concise Syntax
  </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#correlated-subqueries-using-concise-syntax>`

To learn more, see :manual:`$lookup Syntax 
</reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#syntax>`.

.. warning::

   Using ``$lookup`` to enrich a stream can reduce stream processing
   speed.

The following prototype form illustrates all available fields:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "$lookup": {
      "from": {
        "connectionName": "<registered-atlas-connection>",
        "db": "<registered-database-name>",
        "coll": "<atlas-collection-name>"
      },
      "localField": "<field-in-source-messages>",
      "foreignField": "<field-in-from-collection>",
      "let": { 
        <var_1>: <expression>, 
        <var_2>: <expression>, 
        …, 
        <var_n>: <expression> 
      },
      "pipeline": [ 
        <pipeline to run> 
      ],
      "as": "<output-array-field>"
    }  
  } 

.. _atlas-sp-agg-lookup-syntax:

Syntax
~~~~~~

The ``$lookup`` stage takes a document with the following fields:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 15 15 65

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description

   * - from
     - document 
     - Conditional
     - Document that specifies a collection in an {+service+} database
       to join to messages from your :pipeline:`$source`. You must 
       specify a collection only from your Connection Registry.

       If you specify this field, you must specify values for all
       fields in this document.

       This field is not required if you specify a ``pipeline`` field.

   * - from.connectionName
     - string 
     - Conditional
     - Name of the connection in your Connection Registry.

       This field is not required if you specify a ``pipeline`` field.

   * - from.db
     - string 
     - Conditional
     - Name of the {+service+} database that contains the 
       collection you want to join.

       This field is not required if you specify a ``pipeline`` field.

   * - from.coll
     - string 
     - Conditional
     - Name of the collection you want to join.

       This field is not required if you specify a ``pipeline`` field.

   * - localField
     - string
     - Conditional
     - Field from your ``$source`` messages to join on.

       This field is part of the following syntaxes:

       - :manual:`Equality Match with a Single Join Collection 
         </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#equality-match-with-a-single-join-collection>`
       - :manual:`Correlated Subqueries Using Concise Syntax
         </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#correlated-subqueries-using-concise-syntax>`

   * - foreignField
     - string
     - Conditional
     - Field from documents in the ``from`` collection to join on.

       This field is part of the following syntaxes:

       - :manual:`Equality Match with a Single Join Collection 
         </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#equality-match-with-a-single-join-collection>`
       - :manual:`Correlated Subqueries Using Concise Syntax
         </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#correlated-subqueries-using-concise-syntax>`

   * - let
     - document
     - Conditional
     - Specifies the variables to use in the 
       :ref:`pipeline <lookup-join-pipeline>` stages. To learn more,
       see :ref:`let <lookup-join-let>`.

       This field is part of the following syntaxes:

       - :manual:`Join Conditions and Subqueries on a Joined Collection
         </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#join-conditions-and-subqueries-on-a-joined-collection>`
       - :manual:`Correlated Subqueries Using Concise Syntax
         </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#correlated-subqueries-using-concise-syntax>`

   * - pipeline
     - document
     - Conditional
     - Specifies the ``pipeline`` to run on the joined collection. To
       learn more, see :ref:`pipeline <lookup-join-pipeline>`.

       This field is part of the following syntaxes:

       - :manual:`Join Conditions and Subqueries on a Joined Collection
         </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#join-conditions-and-subqueries-on-a-joined-collection>`
       - :manual:`Correlated Subqueries Using Concise Syntax
         </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/#correlated-subqueries-using-concise-syntax>`

   * - as
     - string
     - Required
     - Name of the new array field to add to the input documents. This
       new array field contains the matching documents from the 
       ``from`` collection. If the specified name already exists as a 
       field in the input document, that field is overwritten.

.. _atlas-sp-agg-lookup-behavior:

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

The {+atlas-sp+} version of :ref:`$lookup <streams-agg-pipeline-lookup>` 
performs a left outer join of messages from your ``$source`` and the 
documents in a specified {+service+} collection. This version behaves 
similarly to the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage available in a standard 
MongoDB database. However, this version requires that you specify an 
{+service+} collection from your 
:ref:`Connection Registry <atlas-sp-manage-connections>` as the value for
the ``from`` field.

The :ref:`pipeline <lookup-join-pipeline>` can contain a nested 
:pipeline:`$lookup` stage. If you include a nested :pipeline:`$lookup` 
stage in your pipeline, you must use the standard ``from`` syntax to
specify a collection in the same remote {+service+} connection as the
outer :pipeline:`$lookup` stage.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: json

      $lookup : {
        from: {connectionName: "dbsrv1", db: "db1", coll: "coll1"},
          …,
        pipeline: [
          …,
          {
            $lookup: {
              from: "coll2",
              …,
            }
          },
          …,
        ]
      }

If your pipeline has both :pipeline:`$lookup` and :pipeline:`$merge`
on the same collection, {+atlas-sp+} results might vary if you
try to maintain an incremental view. {+atlas-sp+} processes
multiple source messages simultaneously and then merges them all
together. If multiple messages have the same ID, which both
:pipeline:`$lookup` and :pipeline:`$merge` use, {+atlas-sp+} might 
return results that haven't yet materialized. 

.. example:: 

   Consider the following input stream:

   .. code-block:: shell
      :copyable: false 

      { _id: 1, count: 2 }
      { _id: 1, count: 3 }

   Suppose your query contains the following inside the pipeline: 

   .. code-block:: js
      :copyable: false 

      {
        ...,
        pipeline: [
          { $lookup on _id == foreignDoc._id from collection A }
          { $project: { _id: 1, count: $count + $foreignDoc.count } }
          { $merge: { into collection A } }
        ]
      }

   If you are trying to maintain an incremental view, you might expect a
   result similar to the following:

   .. code-block:: shell
      :copyable: false 

      { _id: 1, count: 5 } 

   However, {+atlas-sp+} might return a count of ``5`` or ``3``
   depending on whether {+atlas-sp+} has processed the documents.

For more information, see :pipeline:`$lookup`.

.. _atlas-sp-agg-lookup-examples:

Examples
~~~~~~~~

A streaming data source generates detailed weather reports from
various locations, conformant to the schema of the :ref:`Sample
Weather Dataset <sample-weather>`. A collection named
``humidity_descriptions`` contains documents of the form:

.. code-block: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     'dew_point': 16.2,
     'relative_humidity': 79,
     'condition': 'sticky, oppressive'
   }

Where the ``relative_humidity`` field describes the relative humidity at
room temperature (20 Celsius), and ``condition`` lists verbal
descriptors appropriate to that level of humidity. You can use the
:ref:`$lookup <atlas-sp-agg-lookup>` stage to enrich the streaming
weather reports with suggested descriptors for meteorologists to use
in weather broadcasts.

The following aggregation has four stages:

1. The :pipeline:`$source` stage establishes a connection with the
   {+kafka+} broker collecting these reports in a topic named
   ``my_weatherdata``, exposing each record as it is ingested to the
   subsequent aggregation stages. This stage also overrides the name
   of the timestamp field it projects, setting it to
   ``ingestionTime``.

2. The ``$lookup`` stage joins the records from the
   ``humidity_descriptions`` database into the weather reports on the
   ``dewPoint`` field.

3. The :pipeline:`$match` stage excludes documents that have an empty
   ``humidity_info`` field, and passes along documents with a populated
   ``humidity_info`` field to the next stage.

4. The :pipeline:`$merge` stage writes the output to an {+service+}
   collection named ``enriched_stream`` in the
   ``sample_weatherstream`` database. If no such database or
   collection exist, {+service+} creates them.

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true
   
   {
     '$source': {
       connectionName: 'sample_weatherdata',
       topic: 'my_weatherdata',
       tsFieldName: 'ingestionTime'
     }
   },
   {
     '$lookup': {
       from: {
         connectionName: 'weatherStream',
         db: 'humidity',
         coll: 'humidity_descriptions'
       },
     'localField':'dewPoint.value',
     'foreignField':'dewPoint',
     'as': 'humidity_info'
     }
   }
   { '$match': { 'humidity_info': { '$ne': [] } } }
   {
     '$merge': {
       into: {
	 connectionName: 'weatherStream',
	 db: 'sample_weatherstream',
	 coll: 'enriched_stream'
       }
     }
   }

To view the documents in the resulting ``sample_weatherstream.enriched_stream``
collection, connect to your {+service+} cluster and run the following command:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: json

      db.getSiblingDB("sample_weatherstream").enriched_stream.find()

   .. output::
      :language: json
