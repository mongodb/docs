==========================
Seed with ``mongorestore``
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


You can use |mongodump| and |mongorestore| to seed |service-fullname|
cluster with data from an existing MongoDB standalone or replica set.
For guidance on seeding data from an existing MongoDB sharded cluster,
contact |service| support by clicking :guilabel:`Support` in the
left-hand navigation of the |service| UI.

While you can :doc:`scale </scale-cluster>` an ``M0``
Free Tier cluster to an ``M10+`` paid cluster using the |service| user
interface, you can also use :binary:`mongodump` and :binary:`mongorestore`
procedures in this section to copy data from an ``M0`` Free Tier cluster
to an ``M10+`` cluster.


Considerations
--------------

Recommended ``mongodump`` and ``mongorestore`` Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the latest stable release version of |mongodump|
and |mongorestore| for this procedure.

Downtime Required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure an up-to-date migration, schedule a maintenance
window where you can stop all writes to your source cluster.
Any write operations issued to the source cluster after the
|mongodump| portion of the procedure completes
are not migrated to the target cluster.

You must cut-over your applications to the target |service| cluster
after |mongorestore| completes the
data restoration before resuming write operations.
See :doc:`/connect-to-database-deployment` for complete
documentation on connecting to a |service| cluster.

The total amount of downtime required depends on factors such as the
size of data being migrated and the network connection between your
source cluster and |service|. If you have questions or concerns about
extended downtime, contact |service| support by clicking
:guilabel:`Support` from the left-hand navigation of the {+atlas-ui+}.

For a guided minimal-downtime migration procedure, see
:ref:`Replica Set Live Migration <live-import-replica>` or
:ref:`Sharded Cluster Live Migration <live-import-sharded>`.

Cluster Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| fully manages database user creation. If the source
cluster enforces authentication:

- Allow read access to the primary.
- If you want to use :binary:`mongorestore <bin.mongorestore>` with the
  :option:`--oplogReplay <mongorestore.--oplogReplay>` option, you must
  delete both the ``admin``and the ``config`` directories from the
  ``dump`` directory that :binary:`mongodump <bin.mongodump>` creates.
  Both the ``admin`` and the ``config`` directories contain database user
  information that you can't add to a |service| cluster with ``mongorestore``.
  Use the |mongorestore| :option:`--nsExclude <mongorestore.--nsExclude>`
  to exclude the ``admin.system.*`` namespace. 

You can't migrate any existing user or role information to |service|.
For the target |service| cluster, create the appropriate database users
for supporting your application's usage patterns. Update your applications
as part of the cut-over procedure to use the new database users. To learn
more, see :ref:`mongodb-users`.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure requires running |mongodump| and
|mongorestore| on a host in the source
cluster. These programs use system resources such as CPU and memory,
and may impact the performance of the host.

Run this procedure during non-peak system usage,
or during a scheduled maintenance window. If the source is a replica
set, you can run this procedure from the host of a :term:`secondary`
member. After stopping writes to the cluster, allow the secondary to
catch up to the primary before starting this procedure.

Pipe Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure uses
`linux pipes <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pipe.2.html>`__ to
stream the output of |mongodump| to |mongorestore|. If the
|mongorestore| process can't keep up with the |mongodump| process,
you may see broken pipe errors.

For guidance on addressing persistent broken pipe errors,
contact |service| support by clicking :guilabel:`Support` from the
left-hand navigation of the |service| UI.
