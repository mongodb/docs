Step 1: Choose a C++17 polyfill
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, :ref:`choose a C++17 polyfill library <cpp-polyfill-selection>`.

Step 2: Download the latest version of the mongocxx driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most reliable starting point for building the mongocxx driver is the latest
release tarball.

The `mongocxx releases <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/releases>`__
page will have links to the release tarball for the version you wish you install.  For
example, to download version {+full-version+}:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -OL https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/releases/download/r{+full-version+}/mongo-cxx-driver-r{+full-version+}.tar.gz
   tar -xzf mongo-cxx-driver-r{+full-version+}.tar.gz
   cd mongo-cxx-driver-r{+full-version+}/build

Make sure you change to the ``build`` directory of whatever source tree you
obtain.

Step 3: Configure the driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Without additional configuration, ``mongocxx`` installs into its local build
directory as a courtesy to those who build from source. To configure
``mongocxx`` for installation into ``/usr/local`` as well, use the following
``cmake`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake ..                                \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release          \
       -DMONGOCXX_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_INSTALL_PREFIX=OFF

These options can be freely mixed with a C++17 polyfill option. For instance, this is how a user
would run the command above with the Boost polyfill option:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake ..                                            \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release                      \
       -DBSONCXX_POLY_USE_BOOST=1                      \
       -DMONGOCXX_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_INSTALL_PREFIX=OFF

Step 4: Build and install the driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build and install the driver:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake --build .
   sudo cmake --build . --target install

The driver can be uninstalled at a later time in one of two ways.  First,
the uninstall target can be called:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo cmake --build . --target uninstall

Second, the uninstall script can be called:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo <install-dir>/share/mongo-cxx-driver/uninstall.sh
