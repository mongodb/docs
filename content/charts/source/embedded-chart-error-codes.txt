   * - Error Code
     - Error Cause
     - More Information

   * - ``-1``
     - Unknown error.
     -

   * - ``2``
     - Chart not found.
     
     - Check the ``id`` field in the iframe and make sure it
       matches the ``id`` in the :guilabel:`Embed Chart` modal window.

   * - ``3``
     - Embedding not enabled.
     
     - Check whether embedding is enabled in your chart's or dashboard's
       :guilabel:`Embed Chart` or :guilabel:`Embed Dashboard` modal 
       window.

   * - ``4``
     - Embedding not allowed.
     
     - Check that embedding is enabled for your
       chart's or dashboard's backing
       :ref:`data source <data-source-embedding>`.

   * - ``5``
     - Invalid payload.
     
     - Your application server is not creating a
       usable :ref:`signature <admin-settings>`.

       Using verified signatures to authenticate your embedded chart
       is deprecated. Instead, use an
       :ref:`embedding authentication provider
       <configure-auth-providers>`.

   * - ``6``
     - Invalid ``autoRefresh`` value specified.
     
     - The ``autoRefresh`` value must be an integer greater than 0.

   * - ``7``
     - :ref:`Filter <embed-options-filter>` not allowed. 
     
     - When you filter an embedded chart, the fields
       used in the filter must be present in the
       :ref:`Allowed filter fields <specify-filter-fields>` list. 
       Additionally, filters embedded charts cannot use non-logical 
       operators before a field name (e.g., :query:`$expr`, 
       :query:`$where`, or :query:`$text`).

   * - ``8``
     - :ref:`Filter <embed-options-filter>` not valid.
     
     - A ``filter`` parameter contains an invalid value.

   * - ``9``
     - Invalid |jwt|.
 
     - Your application's |jwt| is invalid or malformed.

   * - ``10``
     - |jwt| has no matching providers.

     - Your application's |jwt| is not associated with an
       :ref:`Authenticated Embedding Provider
       <configure-auth-providers>`.

   * - ``11``
     - No authentication providers are configured.

     - You must configure an :ref:`Authenticated Embedding Provider
       <configure-auth-providers>` to support your |jwt|.

   * - ``12``
     - |jwt| was issued in the future.

     - This error can occur if the time on the machine that issued the
       |jwt| is more than 5 minutes ahead of the actual time,. This
       can occur if the machine's time has been manually adjusted.

       To resolve this error, ensure that the machine issuing the
       |jwt| is in sync with the actual time and is set to the correct
       time zone.

   * - ``13``
     - |jwt| does not have an expiry date.

     - To use your |jwt| for authenticated embedding, it must have an
       expiry date. A |jwt| that never expires is dangerous because if
       the token is compromised, someone can always access the data
       that the token was securing.

   * - ``14``
     - |jwt| is expired.

     - You need to reissue a |jwt| with an expiration date in the
       future.

   * - ``15``
     - Token lifetime is greater than 24 hours.

     - Your token cannot expire more than 24 hours from the time it
       was created. Refreshing your tokens on a regular basis ensures
       that the token holder still has expected access rights.

   * - ``16``
     - Audience tag on |jwt| does not match with any provider.

     - Your |jwt|\'s audience claim must match the audience claim with
       the token's associated authentication provider.

   * - ``17``
     - Injected filter failed to apply.

     - Your injected filter function failed or returned an illegal
       result.

   * - ``18``
     - Client ID doesn't match provider.

     - This error occurs for Google authentication providers
       if the token is valid but was issued for a different application.
   
   * - ``19``
     - Authentication Provider is deprecated.
     - This error occurs for authentication providers that are deprecated and 
       are no longer supported by MongoDB |charts|.
