To access the |service| |api|, generate an
:ref:`API key <atlas-prog-api-key>` for your organization.

.. note:: Programmatic API Keys can't use the |mms| Console

   Organization |api| keys aren't associated with user credentials and
   can't log in to the |service| console.

Prerequisite
------------

.. _enable-api-access-list:

Enable the API Access List for Your Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For |service| users with a non-empty |api| access list, all |api|
access must originate from an IP address on an |api| access list.
Configure your access list entries to include all clients which require
|api| access. An empty |api| access list grants access to all |api|
endpoints except those that explicitly require an |api| access list.

You can configure |service| to require |api| access listing at the
organization level. When this setting is enabled, all |api| calls
within that organization must originate from an entry on each
respective |service| userâ€™s |api| access list. For organizations that
require |api| access listing, |service| users cannot access any |api|
operations until they define at least one |api| access list entry.

To require an |api| access list for an Organization:

.. include:: /includes/steps/require-ip-access-list.rst

For a description of the |service| |api|'s principles and conventions,
see the :doc:`/api`.

.. _atlas-prog-api-key:

Programmatic API Keys
---------------------

To grant programmatic access to an organization or project using only
the :doc:`API </api>`, create an |api| key.

|api| keys have two parts: a Public Key and a Private Key. You can't
use an |api| key to log into |service| through the user interface.

All |api| keys belong to the organization, but can be given access to
a project.

To create and manage |api| keys, use the :guilabel:`Access Manager`.

When you create a new |api| key, |service| grants key the following
permissions:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Organization
     - :authrole:`Organization Member`
   * - Project
     -
       - :authrole:`Project Read Only`
       - :authrole:`Organization Member`

You can add more permissions to the new |api| key when you create it.

To add the new |api| key created in an organization,
:ref:`invite the API key to the project <invite-org-app-api-keys>`.
