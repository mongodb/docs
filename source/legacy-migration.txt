   If your source {+cluster+} is running a MongoDB version {+c2c-version+} or earlier,
   you can use legacy migration options described in this section to migrate to
   {+c2c-version+}+ destination {+clusters+} in |service|.

   For legacy migration, you use the {+atlas-ui+} to either pull a MongoDB replica set
   into an |service| replica set, or push data from a source replica set
   monitored in |mms| to a destination in |service|.

   If you must use legacy live migration (push) to migrate a source sharded
   {+cluster+}, upgrade the {+cluster+} to MongoDB to {+c2c-version+}+ or {+c2c-version-7+}+,
   and then migrate it to |service| using :ref:`this live migration (push) procedure <c2c-push-live-migration>`.

   You can also use self-managed tools to migrate manually, load files, and
   seed or import data.

This section describes the following legacy migration options:

- :ref:`live-migration-pre60`
- :ref:`migrate-from-com`
- :ref:`self-managed-migration`
- `Migrate a MongoDB Replica Set from AWS to MongoDB Atlas on AWS 
  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/cloud/migrate-from-aws-to-atlas/>`__.
