Resolve Alerts

.. default-domain:: mongodb

|mms| issues an alert for each condition configured in your 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>` when an
:doc:`alert condition </reference/alerts>` occurs, such as an
unresponsive host or an outdated agent. To view all alert 
notifications, click :guilabel:`Alerts` in |mms|.

When a condition triggers an alert, you receive the alert at regular
intervals until the alert resolves or |mms| cancels it. You can
acknowledge an alert for a period of time, but if the alert condition
persists, you will again receive notifications once the acknowledgment
period ends.

You can temporarily suspend alerts on a resource by creating an alert
:ref:`maintenance window <suspend-alerts-during-maintenance-window>`.
For example, you can create a maintenance window
that suspends host alerts while you shut down hosts for maintenance.

.. _resolved-alert:

Resolved Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alerts resolve when the alert condition no longer applies. For example,
if a replica set's :term:`primary` goes down, |mms| issues an alert
that the replica set does not have a primary. When a new primary is
elected, the alert condition no longer applies, and the alert will
resolve. |mms| sends a notification of the alert's resolution.

.. _cancelled-alert:

Cancelled Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| cancels an alert if the alert configuration that triggered the
alert is deleted, disabled, edited, or if the open alert becomes
invalid. Some examples of an alert becoming invalid are:

- There is an open "Host Down" alert, and then you delete the target
  host.

- There is an open "Replication Lag" alert, and the target host becomes
  the primary.

- There is an open "Replica set has no primary" alert for a replica set
  whose name is "rs0," and the target replica set is renamed to "rs1."

When an alert is canceled, |mms| does **not** send a notification and
does not record an entry on the |mms| :guilabel:`Alerts` lists.
