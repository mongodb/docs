Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the ``Mongoid::Document`` module in
{+odm+}. The ``Document`` module is a {+language+} implementation of a
MongoDB document, which stores data in field-and-value pairs. To learn
more about the terminology, structure, and limitations of
MongoDB documents, see :manual:`Documents </core/document/>` in the
{+server-manual+}.

You must include the ``Mongoid::Document`` module in any class that you
want to persist to MongoDB. By including the ``Document`` module in your
model class, you can use its methods on instances of your model class.

The following code demonstrates how to include the ``Document`` module
in a sample ``Person`` model class:

.. code-block:: ruby
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   class Person
       include Mongoid::Document
   
       field :name, type: String
   end

You can find more information about the ``Document`` module in the `API
documentation <{+api+}/Mongoid/Document.html>`__.

Work with Documents
-------------------

You can store instances of your models directly in a collection, or you
can embed them in other classes that use the ``Document`` module.
When you save a ``Document`` instance to MongoDB, it is converted
to a BSON object that is similar to a {+language+} hash or JSON
object.

The following code creates an instance of the ``Person`` model defined
in the preceding section:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Person.create(name: 'Meena Kumar')

The document appears in MongoDB as follows:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     "_id": {
       "$oid": "673b6dce61700598c24a72b0"
     },
     "name": "Meena Kumar"
   }

.. note:: _id Field

   When you persist an instance of a model to the database, MongoDB
   automatically adds an ``_id`` field that has a unique value even if you
   do not explicitly define this field in your model.
   
   To learn more about this field, see the :manual:`ObjectId reference
   </reference/bson-types/#objectid>` in the {+server-manual+}.
