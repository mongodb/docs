The |bi| version 2.11 release introduces significant improvements to
stored schema management. The new stored-schema format is
equivalent to :ref:`DRDL <schema-with-drdl-file>` files. These
improvements are incompatible with |bi-short| configurations from
versions 2.10 and earlier. If you are running |bi-short| 2.10 or
earlier, use the following sections to update your configuration to be
compatible with version 2.11 or later.

If you are already running version 2.11 or later, no further
configuration changes are required. To learn more about the different
schema management configurations introduced in version 2.11, see the
:ref:`Sampling Mode Reference Chart <sampling-mode-chart>`.

Standalone Reader Changes
-------------------------

Use the following table to modify your |bi-short| version 2.10 or
earlier Standalone Reader configuration to be compatible with version
2.11 and later: 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 10 45 45

   * - 
     - Version 2.10 and Earlier
     - Version 2.11 and Later

   * - Mode
     - Standalone Reader
     - Standalone Reader

   * - Behavior
     - :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` samples data upon startup and holds the
       schema in memory.
     - :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` samples data upon startup and holds the
       schema in memory.

   * - Options
     - 
       - ``--sampleMode read``

       - ``--sampleSource`` *not used*

       .. include:: /includes/fact-v210-schema-options.rst

     - None. The ``--sampleMode`` option is deprecated in version 2.11. Remove
       this command line option or configuration file setting to
       continue using standalone mode.

       Any other standalone mode configurations that worked in earlier
       releases will continue to work with version 2.11 and later.

   * - Example
     - The following example launches |bi-short| versions 2.10 and
       earlier in Standalone Reader mode:

       .. code-block:: sh

          mongosqld --sampleMode read

     - The following example launches |bi-short| versions 2.11 and later
       in Standalone Reader mode:

       .. code-block:: sh

          mongosqld

.. include:: /includes/sampling-ref-chart-link.rst

Clustered-Reader Mode to Custom Mode
------------------------------------

Use the following table to modify your |bi-short| version 2.10 or
earlier Clustered-Reader configuration to be compatible with the version
2.11 and later: 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 10 45 45

   * - 
     - Version 2.10 and Earlier
     - Version 2.11 and Later

   * - Mode
     - Clustered-Reader Mode
     - Custom Mode

   * - Behavior
     - The |bi-short| does not sample the schema and uses the MongoDB
       schema stored in the ``--sampleSource`` database to build its
       relational schema.
     - The |bi-short| does not sample the schema and uses the
       :ref:`DRDL <schema-with-drdl-file>` schema from the
       :option:`--schemaSource <mongosqld --schemaSource>` database.

   * - Options
     - 
       - ``--sampleMode read``

       - ``--sampleSource`` <dbName>

       .. include:: /includes/fact-v210-schema-options.rst

     - - :option:`--schemaMode <mongosqld --schemaMode>` ``custom``
       - :option:`--schemaSource <mongosqld --schemaSource>` <dbName>
       - *Optional:* :option:`--schemaName <mongosqld --schemaName>` <schemaName>

   * - Example
     - The following example launches |bi-short| versions 2.10 and
       earlier in Clustered-Reader mode:

       .. code-block:: sh

          mongosqld --sampleMode read \
                    --sampleSource schemaDb

     - The following example launches |bi-short| versions 2.11 and later
       in Custom mode:

       .. code-block:: sh

             mongosqld --schemaMode custom \
                       --schemaSource schemaDb

.. include:: /includes/sampling-ref-chart-link.rst

Clustered-Writer Mode to Auto Mode
----------------------------------

Use the following table to modify your |bi-short| version 2.10 or
earlier Clustered-Writer configuration to be compatible with version 2.11
and later: 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 10 45 45

   * - 
     - Version 2.10 and Earlier
     - Version 2.11 and Later

   * - Mode
     - Clustered-Writer Mode
     - Auto Mode

   * - Behavior
     - The |bi-short| obtains its schema by sampling, and persists
       information about the schema to the ``--sampleSource`` database.
     - The |bi-short| obtains its schema by sampling and persists each
       sampled schema to the
       :option:`--schemaSource <mongosqld --schemaSource>` database in
       the :ref:`DRDL <schema-with-drdl-file>` format.

   * - Options
     - 
       - ``--sampleMode write``

       - ``--sampleSource`` <dbName>

       .. include:: /includes/fact-v210-schema-options.rst

     - - :option:`--schemaMode <mongosqld --schemaMode>` ``auto``
       - :option:`--schemaSource <mongosqld --schemaSource>` <dbName>
       - *Optional:* :option:`--schemaName <mongosqld --schemaName>` <schemaName>

   * - Example
     - The following example launches |bi-short| versions 2.10 and
       earlier in Clustered-Writer mode:

       .. code-block:: sh

          mongosqld --sampleMode write \
                    --sampleSource schemaDb

     - The following example launches |bi-short| versions 2.11 and later
       in Auto mode:

       .. code-block:: sh

             mongosqld --schemaMode auto \
                       --schemaSource schemaDb

.. include:: /includes/sampling-ref-chart-link.rst

Deprecations
------------

The ``--sampleRefreshIntervalSecs`` flag and its corresponding config
file setting ``schema.sample.refreshIntervalSecs`` were deprecated in
favor of
:option:`--schemaRefreshIntervalSecs <mongosqld --schemaRefreshIntervalSecs>`
and :setting:`schema.refreshIntervalSecs`. The old command line option
and configuration file setting will continue to work in the 2.11
release, but switching to the new command line option or configuration
file setting is recommended.
