Install MongoDB Community Edition
---------------------------------

.. _osx-prereq:

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have the Homebrew ``brew`` package installed on your OSX host 
*and* you have previously tapped the official 
`MongoDB Homebrew Tap <https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew>`_, 
skip the prerequisites and go to the :ref:`install` step.

Install XCode
`````````````
.. container::

   Apple's XCode includes command-line tools that are required
   by ``brew``, and is available for free on the App Store. Make sure
   you are running the latest version.

Install Homebrew
````````````````

.. container::

   OSX does not include the Homebrew ``brew`` package by default.
   Install ``brew`` using the 
   `official instructions <https://brew.sh/#install>`_.

Tap the MongoDB Homebrew Tap
````````````````````````````

.. container::

   Issue the following from the terminal to
   tap the official 
   `MongoDB Homebrew Tap <https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew>`_:

   .. code-block:: sh

      brew tap mongodb/brew 

.. _install:

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps to install MongoDB |edition| Edition using the
third-party ``brew`` package manager.

.. container::

   From a terminal, issue the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      brew install mongodb-community@{+version+}

   .. tip::
   
      If you have previously installed an older version of the formula,
      you may encounter a ChecksumMismatchError. To resolve, see
      :ref:`troubleshooting-checksumerror`.

   In addition to the :doc:`binaries </reference/program>`, the install
   creates:

   - the :doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>`
     (:file:`/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`)

   - the :setting:`log directory path <systemLog.path>` (``/usr/local/var/log/mongodb``)

   - the :setting:`data directory path <storage.dbPath>` (``/usr/local/var/mongodb``)

Run MongoDB Community Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps to run MongoDB |edition| Edition. These instructions
assume that you are using the default settings.

.. container::

   You can run MongoDB as a macOS service using ``brew``, or you can run
   MongoDB manually as a background process. It is recommended to run
   MongoDB as a macOS service, as doing so sets the correct system
   ``ulimit`` values automatically (see
   :ref:`ulimit settings <ulimit-settings>` for more information).

   - To run MongoDB (i.e. the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process) **as a
     macOS service**, issue the following:

     .. code-block:: sh

        brew services start mongodb-community@{+version+}

     To stop a :binary:`~bin.mongod` running as a macOS service, use the
     following command as needed:

     .. code-block:: sh

        brew services stop mongodb-community@{+version+}

   - To run MongoDB (i.e. the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process) **manually
     as a background process**, issue the following:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf --fork

     To stop a :binary:`~bin.mongod` running as a background process,
     connect to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` from the :program:`mongo`
     shell, and issue the :dbcommand:`shutdown` command as needed.

   Both methods use the :file:`/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf` file created
   during the install. You can add your own MongoDB
   :doc:`configuration options </reference/configuration-options>` to
   this file as well.

   To verify that MongoDB is running, search for ``mongod`` in your
   running processes:

   .. code-block:: sh

      ps aux | grep -v grep | grep mongod

   You can also view the log file to see the current status of your
   ``mongod`` process: ``/usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log``.

Connect and Use MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   To begin using MongoDB, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the
   running instance. From a new terminal, issue the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo

Troubleshooting ChecksumMismatchError
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have previously installed an older version of the formula,
you may encounter a ChecksumMismatchError resembling the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   Error: An exception occurred within a child process:

     ChecksumMismatchError: SHA256 mismatch

   Expected: c7214ee7bda3cf9566e8776a8978706d9827c1b09017e17b66a5a4e0c0731e1f

     Actual: 6aa2e0c348e8abeec7931dced1f85d4bb161ef209c6af317fe530ea11bbac8f0

   To retry an incomplete download, remove the file above.

To fix:

#. Remove the downloaded :file:`.tgz` archive.

#. Retap the formula.

   .. code-block:: sh

      brew untap mongodb/brew && brew tap mongodb/brew

#. Retry the install.

   .. code-block:: sh

      brew install mongodb-community@{+version+}
