To run your Playground, press the :guilabel:`Play Button` at the top
right of the Playground View. |vsce| splits your Playground and outputs 
the results of your Playground in the :guilabel:`Playground 
Results.json` pane. If you disabled split-view, |vsce| outputs the 
results of your Playground in a new tab.
