This page details steps required for building your Realm application when
using `Mac Catalyst <https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/>`_ with `React
Native version 0.64 and below <https://reactnative.dev/versions>`_.

.. note::

   Version 10.6.0 and above of the Realm React Native SDK supports Mac Catalyst.

.. important::

   Version 0.65 and above of React Native do not require these additional steps to build using Mac Catalyst.

Procedure

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Update Your Build Phase Settings

      Before you can use Mac Catalyst in your React Native application, you must
      specify the platform name. Click :guilabel:`Build Phases` in XCode, and within
      the :guilabel:`Bundle React Native code and images` tab, add the following to
      specify "ios" as the platform name.

      .. code-block:: none

       export PLATFORM_NAME=ios


   .. step:: Update Your Podfile


      .. note::

       This is a temporary step that will not be necessary when the following Cocoapods issue is solved:
       :github:`[Catalyst] Podspec Resource Bundle requires a development team <CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/8891>`

      Currently, there is a :github:`Cocoapods bug
      <CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/8891>` that causes XCode to require a development
      team when building for Mac Catalyst. This bug prevents signing locally. As a
      workaround, you can alter your Podfile to fix your bundle target's signing
      certificate to sign to run locally.

      Replace the post-install script in your Podfile by removing the following lines:

      .. code-block:: none
         :caption: /ios/Podfile

       post_install do |installer|
         react_native_post_install(installer)
       end

      And copy the following lines where your previous post-install script was:

      .. code-block:: none
         :caption: /ios/Podfile

       post_install do |installer|
         react_native_post_install(installer)
         installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
           # Fix bundle targets' 'Signing Certificate' to 'Sign to Run Locally'
           if target.respond_to?(:product_type) and target.product_type == "com.apple.product-type.bundle"
             target.build_configurations.each do |config|
               config.build_settings['CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY[sdk=macosx*]'] = '-'
             end
           end
         end
       end


   .. step:: Activate and Test Catalyst in Your Project

      To test out Catalyst in your project, activate Mac in the :guilabel:`general`
      tab of your XCode project workspace. To do this, click :guilabel:`Mac` in the
      :guilabel:`Deployment Info` section. Select :guilabel:`"Scale Interface to Match iPad"`.
      This makes "My Mac" selectable, allowing you to run your application on your Mac.
