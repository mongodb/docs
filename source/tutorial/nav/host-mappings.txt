|mms| generates a list of *host mappings* when you monitor a new deployment.
Host mappings based on the data that the Monitoring Agent retrieves. |mms|
regenerates the entries on the :guilabel:`Host Mappings` page after each
retrieval.

Host mappings are displayed in three-column rows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70 
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Column
     - Content
   * - :guilabel:`Host`
     - The preferred hostname and port for the deployment.
   * - :guilabel:`Alias`
     - One alternative hostname or address and port for the deployment. 
   * - :guilabel:`Last Updated`
     - The timestamp when the host mapping was updated.

If a host has multiple aliases, each mapping of host to alias is listed in its
own row.

Preferred Hostnames
-------------------

The preferred hostname also appears in the :guilabel:`Name` column of
the :guilabel:`Deployment` page. If you want a different preferred
hostname than what |mms| chose, regenerate the list of mappings
in one of the following ways:

* Specify constraints on how |mms| picks a preferred hostname. See 
  :guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames` in :doc:`/tutorial/manage-project-settings`
  for more information.

* Reset the mapping list.  See :guilabel:`Reset Duplicates` in 
  :doc:`/tutorial/manage-project-settings`
  for more information.

.. important::

   Resetting duplicates and setting constraints on the selection of a
   preferred hostname cause |mms| to lose the monitoring history for
   affected hosts. Chart data based on this history is also lost.
  
Aliases
-------

Depending on what |mms| obtains from a monitored host, the alias may be in any
one of the following forms:

* Fully qualified domain name (FQDN)

* Internal hostname

* External IP address

* Internal IP address

.. important::

   To prevent naming conflicts, |mms| does not use ``localhost`` or similiar
   local designations for new or remapped hosts unless no other hostname
   option is possible.
