.. expression:: exists

   The ``exists`` operator tests if a path to a specified indexed field
   name exists in a document. If the specified field exists but is not
   indexed, the document is not included with the result set.
   ``exists`` is often used as part of a :ref:`compound
   <compound-ref>` query in conjunction with other search clauses.

   ``exists`` has the following syntax:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      { 
        $search: {  
          "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
          "exists": {
            "path": "<field-to-test-for>",
          }
        }
      }

Examples
--------

The following examples use a collection called ``fruit`` that contains
the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "_id" : 1,
     "type" : "apple",
     "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp."
   },
   {
     "_id" : 2,
     "type" : "banana",
     "description" : "Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six."
   },
   { "_id" : 3,
     "type": "apple",
     "description" : "Apple pie and apple cobbler are popular apple-based desserts."
   },
   { "_id" : 4,
     "description" : "Types of citrus fruit include lemons, oranges, and grapefruit.", 
     "quantities" : {
       "lemons": 200,
       "oranges": 240,
       "grapefruit": 160
     }
   }

The ``fruit`` collection has an |fts| index on the ``description`` field
that uses the :ref:`standard <ref-standard-analyzer>` analyzer. The
``standard`` analyzer lower-cases all words and disregards common stop
words (``"the", "a", "and",`` etc).

Basic Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example searches for documents which include a field
called ``type``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "exists": {
           "path": "type"
         }
       }
     }
   ])

The above query returns the first three documents of the collection. The
document with ``_id: 4`` is not included because it does not have a
``type`` field.

Embedded Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use dot notation to search for embedded fields. The following example
searches for documents which have a field named ``lemons`` embedded
within a field named ``quantities``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "exists": {
           "path": "quantities.lemons"
         }
       }
     }
   ])

The above query returns the following result:

.. code-block:: json

   { 
     "_id" : 4,
     "description" : "Types of citrus fruit include lemons, oranges, and grapefruit.", 
     "quantities" : {
       "lemons": 200,
       "oranges": 240,
       "grapefruit": 160
     }
   }

Compound Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses ``exists`` as part of a :ref:`compound
<compound-ref>` query.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "compound": {
           "must": [
             {
               "exists": {
                 "path": "type"
               }
             },
             {
               "search": {
                 "query": "apple",
                 "path": "type"
               }
             }],
           "should": {
             "search": {
               "query": "fuji",
               "path": "description"
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   ])

The above query returns the following results:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { 
     "_id" : 1, 
     "type" : "apple", 
     "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp." 
   }
   { 
     "_id" : 3, 
     "type" : "apple",
     "description" : "Apple pie and apple cobbler are popular apple-based desserts."
   }

Both documents have a ``type`` field, and both include the search term
``apple``. The document with ``_id: 1`` is returned first because it
satisfies the :data:`should` clause.
