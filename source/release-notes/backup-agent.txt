Backup Agent ``1.4.0.17``
-------------------------

Added support for sharded cluster checkpoints that add additional
points-in-time, in between scheduled snapshots, that MMS can use to
create restores. Configure checkpoints using the *Edit Snapshot
Schedule* link and interface.

This version marks a change in the numbering scheme of backup agents
to support improved packaging options for the backup agent.

Backup Agent ``v20131216.1``
----------------------------

- Added support for connecting to MongoDB instances running SSL. See
  the :ref:`Backup Agent Configuration <backup-ssl>` documentation for
  more information.

- The agent will try to use additional MongoS instances to take a
  cluster snapshot if the first MongoS is unavailable.

Backup Agent ``v20131118.0``
----------------------------

- Significantly reduced the amount of time needed by the agent to
  detect situations that require a resync.

- Allow automatic resync operations for config servers in sharded
  clusters. The agent can now resync automatically from these
  servers.

Backup Agent ``v20130923.0``
----------------------------

- When the agent sends the initial meta-data about the data to back up
  (e.g. the list of databases, collections,and indexes,) to the MMS
  API, the agent will not include any databases or collections in the
  "excluded namespace" configuration.

Backup Agent ``v20130826.0``
----------------------------

- Adds support for managing excluded namespaces: Backup Agent will no
  longer send data for excluded collections or databases.

Backup Agent ``v20130812.1``
----------------------------

*Major stability update*

- If the communication between the Backup Agent and the |backup| API
  is interrupted, the Backup Agent can more reliably recover the
  current state. This results in fewer "resync required" errors.
