   MongoDB removes the following command(s) and ``mongo`` shell
   helper(s):

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 25 55
   
      * - Removed Command
        - Removed Helper
        - Alternatives
     
      * - ``cloneCollection``
   
        - ``db.cloneCollection()``

        - - Use :binary:`~bin.mongoexport` and
            :binary:`~bin.mongoimport`, or

          - Use the aggregation pipeline :pipeline:`$out` or
            :pipeline:`$merge` stages, or
 
          - Write a script using the drivers.

      * - ``planCacheListPlans``
   
        - ``PlanCache.getPlansByQuery()``

        - - Use the aggregation pipeline stage :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` or

          - Use the ``mongo`` shell helper method
            :method:`PlanCache.list()`. (Available starting in version 4.4)

          | See also :ref:`4.4-agg-planCachesStats-changes`.

      * - ``planCacheListQueryShapes``

        - ``PlanCache.listQueryShapes()``

        - - Use the aggregation pipeline stage :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` or
 
          - Use the ``mongo`` shell helper method

ref: 4.4-changes-removed-parameters
content: |
   MongoDB removes the following server parameter:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 25 75
   
      * - Removed Parameter
        - Description
     
      * - ``failIndexKeyTooLong``
   
        - MongoDB 4.4 removes the ``failIndexKeyTooLong`` parameter.
          This parameter was deprecated in 4.2 as MongoDB with
          :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <view-fcv>` (fCV) version
          4.2+ no longer imposes an :limit:`Index Key Limit`. 

---
ref: 4.4-changes-planCache-changes
content: |

   Starting in version 4.4, 
   
   - :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` stage can be run on
     :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances as well as on
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. In 4.2,
     :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` stage can only run on
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

   - :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` includes new fields: the :ref:`host
     <plancachestats-host>` field and, when run against a
     :binary:`~bin.mongos`, the :ref:`shard <plancachestats-shard>`
     field.

   - ``mongo`` shell provides the method
     :method:`PlanCache.list()` as a wrapper for
     :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` aggregation stage.

   - MongoDB removes the following:

     - ``planCacheListPlans`` and ``planCacheListQueryShapes``
       commands, and

     - ``PlanCache.getPlansByQuery()`` and
       ``PlanCache.listQueryShapes()`` methods.

     Use :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` or :method:`PlanCache.list()` instead.
---
ref: 4.4-changes-rollback-directory
content: |
   Starting in Mongo 4.4, the rollback directory for a collection is named
   after the collection's UUID rather than the collection namespace; e.g.

   .. code-block:: none
      :copyable: false

      <dbpath>/rollback/20f74796-d5ea-42f5-8c95-f79b39bad190/removed.2020-02-19T04-57-11.0.bson

   For details, see :ref:`replica-set-rollback-data`.

---
ref: 4.4-changes-timestamp-format
content: |

   |timestampfmt| no longer supports ``ctime``. An example of ``ctime`` 
   formatted date is: ``Wed Dec 31 18:17:54.811``.
---
ref: 4.4-changes-meta-convergence
content: |

   As of MongoDB 4.4, there is no distinction between
   the :expression:`$meta` aggregation operator and the
   :expression:`$meta` projection operator.
      
---
ref: 4.4-changes-projection-sort-meta-list
content: |

   - You can specify the :expression:`{ $meta: "textScore" } <$meta>` 
     expression in the :method:`~cursor.sort()` without also specifying the 
     expression in the projection. For example:

     .. code-block:: javascript 

        db.articles.find( 
           { $text: { $search: "cake" } } 
        ).sort( { score: { $meta: "textScore" } } )

     As a result, you can sort the resulting documents by their search
     relevance without projecting the ``textScore``.

   - If you include the :expression:`{ $meta: "textScore" } <$meta>` expression 
     in both the :ref:`projection <find-projection>` and 
     :method:`~cursor.sort()`, the projection and sort documents can have 
     different field names for the expression.

     | For example, in the following operation, the projection uses a
      field named  ``score`` for the expression and the
      :method:`~cursor.sort()` uses the field named ``ignoredName``.

     .. code-block:: javascript 

        db.articles.find(
           { $text: { $search: "cake" } } , 
           { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
        ).sort( { ignoredName: { $meta: "textScore" } } )

---
ref: 4.4-changes-textscore-predicate
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you must specify the :query:`$text` operator
   in the query predicate of the :method:`db.collection.find()` operations
   to use :expression:`{ $meta: "textScore" } <$meta>` expression in the
   projection or sort. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.articles.find(
         { $text: { $search: "cake" } },
         { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
      );

      db.articles.find(
         { $text: { $search: "cake" } },
         { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
      ).sort( { score: {  $meta: "textScore" } } );
   

   If you do not specify the :query:`$text` operator in the query
   predicate, the operation fails. For example, the following operations are
   invalid starting in MongoDB 4.4:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.articles.find(
         { },
         { score: { $meta: "textScore" } } 
      )

      db.articles.find(
         { },
         { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
      ).sort( { score: {  $meta: "textScore" } } );
   
---
ref: 4.4-changes-natural-sort-views
content: |

   You can specify a :operator:`$natural` sort when running a :dbcommand:`find` 
   operation against a :ref:`view <views-landing-page>`.
---
ref: 4.4-changes-drop-in-progress-indexes
content: |

   The :method:`db.collection.drop()` method and :dbcommand:`drop` command 
   abort any in-progress index builds on the target collection before dropping 
   the collection. 

   .. include:: /includes/fact-abort-index-build-replica-sets.rst
---
ref: 4.4-changes-drop-database-in-progress-indexes
content: |

   The :method:`db.dropDatabase()` method and :dbcommand:`dropDatabase` command 
   abort any in-progress index builds on collections in the target database 
   before dropping the database. Aborting an index build has the same effect as 
   dropping the built index. 

---
ref: 4.4-changes-minimum-oplog-retention-period
content: |

   You can specify the minimum number of hours to preserve an oplog entry 
   where :binary:`~bin.mongod` only removes an oplog entry *if* both of the 
   following criteria are met:

   - The oplog has reached the :ref:`maximum configured size
     <replica-set-oplog-sizing>`.

   - The oplog entry is older than the configured number of hours based
     on the host system clock.

   By default MongoDB does not set a minimum oplog retention period and
   automatically truncates the oplog starting with the oldest entries to
   maintain the configured maximum oplog size.

---
ref: 4.4-changes-minimum-oplog-retention-period-nolinks
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can specify the minimum number of hours
   to preserve an oplog entry. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` only truncates

ref: 4.4-changes-index-builds-simultaneous-fcv
content: |

   .. note:: Requires ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` 4.4+
   
      Each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the replica set or sharded cluster
      *must* have :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <set-fcv>` set to at
      least ``4.4`` to start index builds simultaneously across 
      replica set members.

---
ref: 4.4-changes-index-builds-simultaneous
content: |

   Index builds on a replica set or sharded cluster build simultaneously across 
   all data-bearing replica set members. For sharded clusters, the index build 
   occurs only on shards containing data for the collection being indexed. 
   The primary requires a minimum number of data-bearing :rsconf:`voting
   <members[n].votes>` members (i.e commit quorum), including itself,
   that must complete the build before marking the index as ready for
   use. See :ref:`index-operations-replicated-build` for more
   information.

   The :dbcommand:`replSetGetConfig` command
   can specify a new option :ref:`commitmentStatus: true
   <replSetGetConfig-commitmentStatus>` when run on the primary. When
   run with the option, the command includes in the output a
   :ref:`commitmentStatus <replSetGetConfig-output-commitmentStatus>`
   field. This output field indicates whether the replica set's
   previous reconfig has been committed, so that the replica set is
   ready to be reconfigured again. |moreinfo|
---
ref: 4.4-validate-data-throughput
content: |
   
   The :pipeline:`$currentOp` and the :dbcommand:`currentOp` command
   include :data:`~$currentOp.dataThroughputAverage` and
   :data:`~$currentOp.dataThroughputLastSecond` information for
   validate operations in progress.

   The log messages for validate operations include
   ``dataThroughputAverage`` and ``dataThroughputLastSecond``
   information.
---
ref: 4.4-replSetReconfig-majority
content: |
   
   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` command
   waits until a majority of voting members install the replica
   configuration before returning success. A voting member is *any*
   replica member where :rsconf:`members[n].votes` is ``1``, including
   arbiters. First, the operation waits until the *current*
   configuration is committed before installing the *new* configuration
   on the primary. The operation then waits until a majority of voting
   members install the *new* configuration before returning
   successfully. See
   :ref:`replSetReconfig-cmd-majority-install` for more information.
   
   :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` waits indefinitely for a majority of
   voting members to install the configuration by default. MongoDB 4.4
   also adds the optional :ref:`maxTimeMS
   <replSetReconfig-cmd-maxTimeMS>` parameter to
   :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` for specifying the maximum amount of
   time to wait for the operation to return successfully.
---
ref: 4.4-replSetReconfig-single-node-voting-change
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` command
   allows adding or removing no more than ``1`` :rsconf:`voting
   <members[n].votes>` member at a time. To add or remove multiple
   voting members, issue a series of :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` or
   :method:`rs.reconfig()` operations to add or remove one member at a
   time. See :ref:`replSetReconfig-cmd-single-node` for more
   information.

---
ref: 4.4-replSetGetConfig-term-field
content: |

   MongoDB 4.4 adds the :rsconf:`term` field to the replica set
   :ref:`configuration document <replica-set-configuration-document>`.
   Replica set members use :rsconf:`term` and :rsconf:`version` to
   achieve consensus on the "newest" replica configuration. Setting
   :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion (fCV) : "4.4" <set-fcv>`
   implicitly performs a :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` to add the
   :rsconf:`term` field to the configuration document and blocks until
   the new configuration propagates to a majority of replica set
   members. Similarly, downgrading to ``fCV : "4.2"`` implicitly
   performs a reconfiguration to remove the :rsconf:`term` field.

---
ref: 4.4-changes-migrate-jumbo-chunks
content: |
   For chunks that are :ref:`too large to migrate
   <migration-chunk-size-limit>`, starting in MongoDB 4.4:

   - A new balancer setting ``attemptToBalanceJumboChunks`` allows the
     balancer to migrate chunks too large to move as long as the chunks
     are not labeled :ref:`jumbo <jumbo-chunk>`. See
     :ref:`balance-chunks-that-exceed-size-limit` for details.

   - The :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command can specify a new option
     :ref:`forceJumbo <movechunk-forceJumbo>` to allow for the
     migration of chunks that are too large to move. The chunks may or
     may not be labeled :ref:`jumbo <jumbo-chunk>`.
---
ref: 4.4-changes-repl-state-restrictions
content: |

   To run on a replica set member, the following operations require the member 
   to be in :replstate:`PRIMARY` or :replstate:`SECONDARY` state.
   
   - :dbcommand:`listDatabases`
   - :dbcommand:`listCollections`
   - :dbcommand:`listIndexes`
   - :dbcommand:`distinct`
   - :dbcommand:`dbStats`
   - :dbcommand:`collStats`

   If the member is in another state, such as :replstate:`STARTUP2`,
   the operation errors.

ref: 4.4-changes-getLastErrorDefaults-deprecation
content: |

  Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB deprecates specifying a
  :rsconf:`settings.getLastErrorDefaults` value other than the default
  of ``{ w: 1, wtimeout: 0 }``. MongoDB 4.4 honors any write concern
  value that you specify, however future MongoDB versions might not
  honor values other than the default. Instead, use the
  :dbcommand:`setDefaultRWConcern` command to set the default read or
  write concern configuration for a replica set or sharded cluster.
