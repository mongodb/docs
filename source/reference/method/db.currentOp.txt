Definition
----------

.. method:: db.currentOp()

   Returns a :term:`document` that contains information on in-progress
   operations for the database instance.

   :method:`db.currentOp()` method has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.currentOp(<operations>)

   The :method:`db.currentOp()` method can take the following *optional*
   argument:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-db.currentOp-param.rst

.. _currentOp-behavior:

Behavior
--------

:method:`db.currentOp()` can accept a filter document or a boolean
parameter.

If you pass a filter document to :method:`db.currentOp()`, the output
returns information only for the current operations that match the
filter. The filter document can contain:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85
   
   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``"$ownOps"``

     - Boolean. If set to ``true``, returns information on the current user's
       operations only.

       On :program:`mongod` instances, users can always run
       ``db.currentOp( { "$ownOps": true } )`` to view their own
       operations.
       
       .. versionadded:: 3.2.9

   * - ``"$all"``

     - Boolean. If set to ``true``, returns information on all operations,
       including operations on idle connections and system operations.

       If the document includes ``"$all": true`` along with
       :ref:`currentOp-output-fields` conditions, only the
       ``"$all":true`` applies.

   * - :ref:`currentOp-output-fields`

     - Specify filter conditions on the :ref:`currentOp-output-fields`.
       See :ref:`currentOp-examples`.
       
       If the document includes ``"$all": true`` along with
       :ref:`currentOp-output-fields` conditions, only the ``"$all":
       true`` applies.
 
Passing in ``true`` to :method:`db.currentOp()` is equivalent to
passing in a document of ``{ "$all": true }``. The following operations
are equivalent:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.currentOp(true)
   db.currentOp( { "$all": true } )

.. include:: /includes/fact-diagnostic-info.rst

Access Control
--------------

On systems running with :setting:`~security.authorization`, the user
must have access that includes the :authaction:`inprog` privilege
action. 

.. versionchanged:: 3.2.9

   On :program:`mongod` instances, users can run ``db.currentOp( {
   "$ownOps": true } )`` to view their own operations even without the
   :authaction:`inprog` privilege action.

.. _currentOp-examples:

Examples
--------

The following examples use the :method:`db.currentOp()` method with
various query documents to filter the output.

.. _currentOp-output-fields:

Output Fields
-------------

.. data:: currentOp.desc

   A description of the client. This string includes the
   :data:`~currentOp.connectionId`.

.. data:: currentOp.threadId

   An identifier for the thread that handles the operation and its
   connection.

.. data:: currentOp.connectionId

   An identifier for the connection where the operation originated.

.. data:: currentOp.opid

   The identifier for the operation. You can pass this value to
   :method:`db.killOp()` in the :program:`mongo` shell to terminate the
   operation.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/warning-terminating-ops-method.rst

.. data:: currentOp.active

   A boolean value specifying whether the operation has started. Value
   is ``true`` if the operation has started or ``false`` if the
   operation is idle, such as an idle connection or an internal thread
   that is currently idle. An operation can be active even if the
   operation has yielded to another operation.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

      For some inactive background threads, such as an inactive
      ``signalProcessingThread``, MongoDB suppresses various empty
      fields.

.. data:: currentOp.secs_running

   The duration of the operation in seconds. MongoDB calculates this
   value by subtracting the current time from the start time of the
   operation.

   Only appears if the operation is running; i.e. if
   :data:`~currentOp.active` is ``true``.

.. data:: currentOp.microsecs_running

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   The duration of the operation in microseconds. MongoDB calculates this
   value by subtracting the current time from the start time of the
   operation.

   Only appears if the operation is running; i.e. if
   :data:`~currentOp.active` is ``true``.

.. data:: currentOp.op

   A string that identifies the type of operation. The possible values
   are:

   - ``"none"``
   - ``"update"``
   - ``"insert"``
   - ``"query"``
   - ``"getmore"``
   - ``"remove"``
   - ``"killcursors"``

   ``"query"`` operations include read operations as well as most
   commands such as the :dbcommand:`createIndexes` command and the
   :dbcommand:`findandmodify` command.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

      Write operations that use the :dbcommand:`insert`,
      :dbcommand:`update`, and :dbcommand:`delete` commands
      respectively display ``"insert"``, ``"update"``, and ``"delete"``
      for :data:`~currentOp.op`. Previous versions include these write
      commands under ``"query"`` operations.

.. data:: currentOp.ns

   The :term:`namespace` the operation targets. A namespace consists of
   the :term:`database` name and the :term:`collection` name
   concatenated with a dot (``.``); that is,
   ``"<database>.<collection>"``.

.. data:: currentOp.insert

   Contains the document to be inserted for operations with
   :data:`~currentOp.op` value of ``"insert"``. Only appears for
   operations with :data:`~currentOp.op` value ``"insert"``.

   Insert operations such as :method:`db.collection.insert()` that use
   the :dbcommand:`insert` command will have :data:`~currentOp.op` value
   of ``"query"``.

.. data:: currentOp.query

   A document containing information on operations whose
   :data:`~currentOp.op` value is *not* ``"insert"``. For instance, for
   a :method:`db.collection.find()` operation, the
   :data:`~currentOp.query` contains the query predicate.

   :data:`~currentOp.query` does not appear for :data:`~currentOp.op`
   of ``"insert"``. :data:`~currentOp.query` can also be an empty
   document.

   For :data:`"update" <currentOp.op>` or :data:`"remove"
   <currentOp.op>` operations or for read operations categorized under
   :data:`"query" <currentOp.op>`, the :data:`~currentOp.query`
   document contains the query predicate for the operations.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/currentOp-getmore-operation-query-field.rst

   For other commands categorized under :data:`"query" <currentOp.op>`,
   :data:`~currentOp.query` contains the issued command
   document. Refer to the specific command reference page for the details
   on the command document.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

       Previous versions categorized operations that used write
       commands under :data:`~currentOp.op` of ``"query"`` and returned
       the write command information (e.g. query predicate, update
       statement, and update options) in :data:`~currentOp.query`
       document.

.. data:: currentOp.planSummary

   A string that contains the query plan to help debug slow queries.

.. data:: currentOp.client

   The IP address (or hostname) and the ephemeral port of the client
   connection where the operation originates. If your ``inprog``
   array has operations from many different clients, use this string
   to relate operations to clients.

.. data:: currentOp.locks

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

   The :data:`~currentOp.locks` document reports the type and mode of
   locks the operation currently holds. The possible lock types are as
   follows:

   .. include:: /includes/fact-lock-types.rst

   The possible modes are as follows:

   .. include:: /includes/fact-lock-modes.rst

.. data:: currentOp.waitingForLock

   Returns a boolean value. :data:`~currentOp.waitingForLock` is ``true`` if the
   operation is waiting for a lock and ``false`` if the operation has
   the required lock.

.. data:: currentOp.msg

   The :data:`~currentOp.msg` provides a message that describes the status and
   progress of the operation. In the case of indexing or mapReduce
   operations, the field reports the completion percentage.

.. data:: currentOp.progress

   Reports on the progress of mapReduce or indexing operations. The
   :data:`~currentOp.progress` fields corresponds to the completion percentage in
   the :data:`~currentOp.msg` field. The :data:`~currentOp.progress` specifies the following
   information:

   .. data:: currentOp.progress.done

      Reports the number completed.

   .. data:: currentOp.progress.total

      Reports the total number.

.. data:: currentOp.killPending

   Returns ``true`` if the operation is currently flagged for
   termination.  When the operation encounters its next safe termination point, the
   operation will terminate.

.. data:: currentOp.numYields

   :data:`~currentOp.numYields` is a counter that reports the number of times the
   operation has yielded to allow other operations to complete.

   Typically, operations yield when they need access to data that
   MongoDB has not yet fully read into memory. This allows
   other operations that have data in memory to complete quickly
   while MongoDB reads in data for the yielding operation.

.. data:: currentOp.fsyncLock

   Specifies if database is currently locked for :method:`fsync
   write/snapshot <db.fsyncLock()>`.

   Only appears if locked; i.e. if :data:`~currentOp.fsyncLock` is
   ``true``.

.. data:: currentOp.info

   Information regarding how to unlock database from
   :method:`db.fsyncLock()`. Only appears if
   :data:`~currentOp.fsyncLock` is ``true``.

.. data:: currentOp.lockStats

   For each lock type and mode (see :data:`currentOp.locks` for
   descriptions of lock types and modes), returns the following
   information:

   .. COMMENT
      these definitions are for per operations and not for server,
      as such, they differ from those in serverStatus.txt

   .. data:: currentOp.lockStats.acquireCount

      Number of times the operation acquired the lock in the specified
      mode.

   .. data:: currentOp.lockStats.acquireWaitCount

      Number of times the operation had to wait for the
      :data:`~currentOp.lockStats.acquireCount` lock acquisitions
      because the locks were held in a conflicting mode.
      :data:`~currentOp.lockStats.acquireWaitCount` is less than or
      equal to :data:`~currentOp.lockStats.acquireCount`.

   .. data:: currentOp.lockStats.timeAcquiringMicros

      Cumulative time in microseconds that the operation had to wait to
      acquire the locks.

      :data:`~currentOp.lockStats.timeAcquiringMicros` divided by
      :data:`~currentOp.lockStats.acquireWaitCount` gives an
      approximate average wait time for the particular lock mode.

   .. data:: currentOp.lockStats.deadlockCount

      Number of times the operation encountered deadlocks while waiting
      for lock acquisitions.
