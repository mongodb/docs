Enable x.509 Authentication for your |mms| Group
================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

.. include:: /includes/enable-auth-intro.rst

.. next paragraph stolenish from the MongoDB Manual

MongoDB supports x.509 certificate authentication for use with a secure
:doc:`TLS/SSL connection </tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment>`. 
The x.509 client authentication allows clients to
authenticate to servers with certificates rather than with a username
and password.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/enterprise-availability-x509.rst

|mms| does **not** currently support :manual:`using x.509 certificates
for membership authentication
<tutorial/configure-x509-member-authentication/>`.

Considerations
--------------

.. important::
   A full description of TLS/SSL, PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
   certificates, in particular x.509 certificates, and Certificate
   Authority is beyond the scope of this document. This tutorial assumes
   prior knowledge of TLS/SSL as well as access to valid x.509
   certificates.

In order to enable x.509 Authentication for |mms|, you must obtain
valid certificates generated and signed by a single certificate authority.
Refer to the :manual:`Client x.509 Certificate </tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication>`
in the MongoDB Manual for more about the certificate requirements.

Procedures
----------

This procedure describes how to configure and enable x.509
authentication when using Automation. If your Monitoring or Backup
agents are **not** managed by |mms|, you must manually configure them to
use x.509 authentication. See:
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-x509` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-x509` for instructions.

Configure an Existing Deployment for x.509 Client Certificate Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have one or more existing deployments managed by |mms|, the
MongoDB deployment must be configured for x.509 Client Certificate
authentication before you can enable x.509 authentication for your group.

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-existing-deployment-for-x509.rst

When you have configured the SSL options for each deployment, you can
proceed to enable x.509 authentication for your |mms| group.
