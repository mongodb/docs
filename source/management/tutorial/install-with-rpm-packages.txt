.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| is a service to monitor and back up a MongoDB infrastructure. This
tutorial describes the basic process to install and configure the service.

At a high level, a basic installation will look like the following.
The estimated setup time is less than an hour.

#. Configure an MMS Application Server that meets the :doc:`hardware
   requirements </management/requirements>`.

#. Install a single MongoDB replica set as described in the
   :doc:`/management/tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances`.

#. Install an SMTP email server as appropriate for your environment.

#. Install the MMS Application Package

#. Configure the MMS server's URL, email addresses, and Mongo URI connection strings.

#. Start up the MMS application.

Links to configure the MMS application and start MMS are at the bottom of
this tutorial.

Prerequisites
-------------

Download the latest On-Prem Monitoring releases from <http://www.mongodb.com/commercialsupport/downloads>.

Confirm your environment meets the :doc:`/management/requirements`.

Procedures
----------

Install and Start MMS Application Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the :manual:`MongoDB Installation tutorials </installation>` for
complete instructions on this procedure.

Install the MMS Application Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the ``.rpm`` by issuing command in the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo rpm --ivh mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.rpm

Replace ``<version>`` with the version of the ``.rpm`` you
obtained. When installed, the base directory for the MMS software is
``/opt/mongodb/mms/``. The RPM package will also create a new system
user ``mongodb-mms`` under which the server will run.

Update the MMS Software Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upgrade |mms| from 1.3
++++++++++++++++++++++

#. *Recommended.* Take a full backup of the MMS database before
   beginning the upgrade procedure.

#. Shut down MMS, using the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo service mongodb-mms stop

#. Save a copy of your previous configuration file

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo cp /opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties ~/.

#. Upgrade the package

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo rpm -U mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.deb

#. Move the new version of the configuration file into place

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo mv /opt/mongodb-mms/conf/conf-mms.properties.rpmnew /opt/mongodb-mms/conf/conf-mms.properties

#. Fill in the new configuration file at ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties``
   using your old file as a reference point.

#. Start MMS, using the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo service mongodb-mms start

Upgrade |mms| from 1.2 and Earlier
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Due to the `company name change
<http://www.mongodb.com/press/10gen-announces-company-name-change-mongodb-inc>`_,
the name of the MMS package changed between versions 1.2 and 1.3.
Therefore, to upgrade the |mms| server from *any* version before 1.3, use
the following procedure:

#. *Recommended.* Take a full backup of the MMS database before
   beginning the upgrade procedure.

#. Shut down MMS, using the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      /etc/init.d/10gen-mms stop

#. Download the latest package and proceed with the instructions
   for a fresh install. Do not attempt to use your package manager
   to do an upgrade.

   When complete, |mms| is installed in the ``/opt/mongodb/mms``
   directory.

#. Follow all procedures for a new install include configuring the
   options in ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties``. If you
   used encrypted authentication credentials you will need to
   regenerate these manually.  *Do not copy the credentials from
   your old properties file. Old credentials will not work.*

#. Start MMS  using the new package name:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms start

#. Update any Monitoring Agent. See :ref:`upgrade-mms-agent` for
   more information.
