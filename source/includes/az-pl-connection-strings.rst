      When you configure a private endpoint, |service| generates DNS
      seedlist and standard private endpoint-aware connection strings:

      - DNS seedlist connection

        .. code-block:: none
           :copyable: false

           mongodb+srv://cluster0-pl-0.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net

      - Standard connection string

        .. code-block:: none
           :copyable: false

           mongodb://pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net:1024,pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net:1025,pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net:1026/?ssl=truereplicaSet=atlas-18bndf-shard-0

      When a client in your VNet connects to an |service| cluster using
      one of these private endpoint-aware connection strings, the
      client attempts to establish a connection to the Private Link
      Service in the |service| VNet through the private endpoint's
      network interface. The Private Link service sends traffic through
      an |azure| Standard Load Balancer to the |service| cluster nodes
      that you deployed in that region. Your client's |dns| resolution
      mechanism handles resolving the hostname to the network
      interface's private IP address. The driver is only aware of the
      hostname in the connection string, listening on one port for each 
      node in the cluster's replica set.

      **SRV Record for DNS Seedlist Private Endpoint-Aware Connection Strings**

      The following example shows the SRV record for an 
      {+az-pl+}-enabled single-region cluster, showing three unique
      ports defined for ``pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net``:


      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         $ nslookup -type=SRV _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net

         Server:  127.0.0.53
         Address:  127.0.0.53#53

         Non-authoritative answer:
         _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net service = 0 0 1024 pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net.
         _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net service = 0 0 1025 pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net.
         _mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net service = 0 0 1026 pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net.

      .. tip::

         In the preceding example:

         - ``_mongodb._tcp.cluster0-pl-0.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net`` is
            the SRV record that the connection string references. 
         - ``pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net`` is the hostname for
            each node in one |service| cluster in one region for which
            you have configured {+az-pl+}.
         - ``1024``, ``1025``, and ``1026`` are unique ports that 
            |service| assigns on the load balancer for each |service|
            replica set node in the region for which you enabled 
            {+az-pl+}. All nodes in an |service| replica set are
            accessible via the same hostname, with the load balancer
            resolving individual nodes by their unique port.

      **Hostname DNS Resolution in Private Endpoint-Aware Connection Strings and SRV Records**

      The hostname in the SRV record and the standard connection string
      is an |dns| ``A`` record that resolves to the private IP address
      of the private endpoint's network interface. 

      The following example shows the |dns| lookup for the hostname in
      the SRV record and in the standard connection string:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         $ nslookup pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net
         Server:  127.0.0.53
         Address:  127.0.0.53#53

         Non-authoritative answer:
         Name:	pl-0-eastus2.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net
         Address: 10.0.0.4

   .. tab:: {+Serverless-Instances+}
      :tabid: serverless-instances

      When you configure a private endpoint, |service| generates a DNS
      seedlist connection string:

      - DNS seedlist connection

        .. code-block:: none
           :copyable: false

           mongodb+srv://cluster0-pl-0.uzgh6.azure.mongodb.net

      When a client in your VNet connects to an |service| 
      {+database-deployment+} using the private-endpoint-aware
      connection string, the client attempts to establish a connection
      to the Private Link Service in the |service| VNet through the
      private endpoint's network interface. The Private Link service
      sends traffic through an |azure| Standard Load Balancer to the 
      |service| {+database-deployment+} that you deployed in that
      region. Your client's |dns| resolution mechanism handles
      resolving the hostname to the network interface's private IP
      address. The driver is only aware of the hostname in the
      connection string.

      **Hostname DNS Resolution in Private Endpoint-Aware Connection Strings and SRV Records**

      The hostname in the SRV record and the standard connection string
      is an |dns| ``A`` record that resolves to the private IP address
      of the private endpoint's network interface.
