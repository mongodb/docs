title: Shut down the entire cluster.
stepnum: 1
ref: shutdown-cluster
pre: |
  Stop all :program:`mongos` and :program:`mongod` processes, including
  all shards *and* all config servers. To stop all members, connect to
  **each** member and issue following operations:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    use admin
    db.shutdownServer()

title: Restore the data files.
stepnum: 2
ref: restore
content: |
  On each server, extract the data files to the location where the
  :program:`mongod` instance will access them and restore the following:

  - **Data files for each server in each shard.**

    For each shard replica set, restore all the members of the replica
    set. See :doc:`/tutorial/restore-replica-set-from-backup`.

  - **Data files for each config server.**
 
    To restore to the :ref:`config server replica set (CSRS) <csrs>`,
    see :doc:`/tutorial/restore-replica-set-from-backup`.

  .. seealso:: :ref:`backup-restore-snapshot`.

stepnum: 5

content: |
   If shard hostnames have changed, connect a :program:`mongo` shell to
   the :program:`mongos` instance and update the :data:`~config.shards`
   collection in the :ref:`config-database` to reflect the new
   hostnames.

title: "Clear per-shard sharding recovery information."
stepnum: 6
ref: per-shard-recovery
pre: |
   If the backup data was from a deployment using :ref:`CSRS <csrs>`,
   clear out the no longer applicable recovery information on each shard. For each
   shard:
      
   #. Restart the replica set members for the shard with the
      :parameter:`recoverShardingState` parameter set to ``false``.
      Include additional options as required for your specific
      configuration.

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --setParameter=recoverShardingState=false --replSet <replSetName> --shardsvr --port <port>

   #. Connect :program:`mongo` shell to the primary of the replica set
      and delete from the ``admin.system.version`` collection the
      document where ``_id`` equals ``minOpTimeRecovery`` id. Use
      write concern ``"majority"``.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         use admin

  the cluster is operational.
