"Conceptually, documents from a collection travel through an aggregation "

"The MongoDB aggregation pipeline starts with the documents of a collection "
"and streams the documents from one :ref:`pipeline operator <aggregation-"
"pipeline-operator-reference>` to the next to process the documents. Each "
"operator in the pipeline transforms the documents as they pass through the "
"pipeline. Pipeline operators do not need to produce one output document for "
"every input document. Operators may generate new documents or filter out "
"documents. Pipeline operators can be repeated in the pipeline."
