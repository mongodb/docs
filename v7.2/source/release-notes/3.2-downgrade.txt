Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
of this document, particularly the :ref:`3.2-downgrade-considerations`
and the procedure for :ref:`downgrading sharded clusters
<3.2-downgrade-cluster>`.

.. _3.2-downgrade-considerations:

Downgrade Recommendations and Checklist
---------------------------------------

When downgrading, consider the following:

Downgrade Path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To downgrade, use the latest version in the 3.0-series.

Preparedness
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :ref:`Remove or downgrade version 3 text indexes
  <downgrade-text-index-v3>` before downgrading MongoDB 3.2 to 3.0.

- :ref:`Remove or downgrade version 3 2dsphere indexes
  <downgrade-2dsphere-index-v3>` before downgrading MongoDB 3.2 to 3.0.

Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the downgrade procedures:

- To downgrade sharded clusters, see :ref:`3.2-downgrade-cluster`.

- To downgrade replica sets, see :ref:`3.2-downgrade-replica-set`.

- To downgrade a standalone MongoDB instance, see :ref:`3.2-downgrade-standalone`.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. _downgrade-text-index-v3:

Text Index Version Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have *version 3* text indexes (i.e. the default version for text
indexes in MongoDB 3.2), drop the *version 3* text indexes before
downgrading MongoDB. After the downgrade,
recreate the dropped text indexes.

To determine the version of your ``text`` indexes, run
:method:`db.collection.getIndexes()` to view index specifications. For
text indexes, the method returns the version information in the field
``textIndexVersion``. For example, the following shows that the
``text`` index on the ``quotes`` collection is version 3.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 15

   {
      "v" : 1,
      "key" : {
         "_fts" : "text",
         "_ftsx" : 1
      },
      "name" : "quote_text_translation.quote_text",
      "ns" : "test.quotes",
      "weights" : {
         "quote" : 1,
         "translation.quote" : 1
      },
      "default_language" : "english",
      "language_override" : "language",
      "textIndexVersion" : 3
   }

.. _downgrade-2dsphere-index-v3:

``2dsphere`` Index Version Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have *version 3* ``2dsphere`` indexes (i.e. the default version
for ``2dsphere`` indexes in MongoDB 3.2), drop the *version 3*
``2dsphere`` indexes before downgrading MongoDB. After the downgrade,
recreate the ``2dsphere`` indexes.

To determine the version of your ``2dsphere`` indexes, run
:method:`db.collection.getIndexes()` to view index specifications. For
``2dsphere`` indexes, the method returns the version information in the field
``2dsphereIndexVersion``. For example, the following shows that the
``2dsphere`` index on the ``locations`` collection is version 3.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 9

   {
      "v" : 1,
      "key" : {
         "geo" : "2dsphere"
      },
      "name" : "geo_2dsphere",
      "ns" : "test.locations",
      "sparse" : true,
      "2dsphereIndexVersion" : 3
   }

.. _downgrade-partial-index:

Partial Indexes Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before downgrading MongoDB, drop any partial indexes.

.. _3.2-downgrade-standalone:

Downgrade a Standalone ``mongod`` Instance
------------------------------------------

The following steps outline the procedure to downgrade a standalone
:binary:`~bin.mongod` from version 3.2 to 3.0.

.. include:: /includes/steps/3.2-downgrade-mongod.rst

.. _`MongoDB Download Page`: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

.. _3.2-downgrade-replica-set:

Downgrade a 3.2 Replica Set
---------------------------

The following steps outline a "rolling" downgrade process for the
replica set. The "rolling" downgrade process minimizes downtime by
downgrading the members individually while the other members are
available:

.. include:: /includes/steps/3.2-downgrade-replica-set.rst

Replica set failover is not instant but will render the set unavailable to
writes and interrupt reads until the failover process
completes. Typically this takes 10 seconds or more. You may wish to
plan the downgrade during a predetermined maintenance window.

.. _3.2-downgrade-cluster:

Downgrade a 3.2 Sharded Cluster
-------------------------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the downgrade is in progress, you cannot make changes to the
collection metadata. For example, during the downgrade, do
**not** do any of the following:

- :method:`sh.enableSharding()`

- :method:`sh.shardCollection()`

- :method:`sh.addShard()`

- :method:`db.createCollection()`

- :method:`db.collection.drop()`

- :method:`db.dropDatabase()`

- any operation that creates a database

- any other operation that modifies the cluster meta-data in any
  way. See :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list of
  sharding commands. Note, however, that not all commands on the
  :doc:`/reference/sharding` page modifies the cluster meta-data.
