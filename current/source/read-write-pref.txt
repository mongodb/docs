Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to configure **write concern**, **read concern**,
and **read preference** options to modify the way that the {+driver-short+} runs create,
read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on replica sets.

Read and Write Settings Precedence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set write concern, read concern, and read preference options at the following
levels:

- Client, which sets the *default for all operation executions* unless overridden
- Transaction
- Database
- Collection

This list also indicates the increasing order of precedence of the option settings. For
example, if you set a read concern level for a transaction, it will override a read
concern level inherited from the client.

Write concern, read concern, and read preference options allow you to customize the
causal consistency and availability of the data in your replica sets. To see a full
list of these options, see the following guides in the {+mdb-server+} manual:

- :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference/>`
- :manual:`Read Concern </reference/read-concern/>`
- :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>`

.. _scala-read-write-config:

Configure Read and Write Operations
-----------------------------------

You can control how the driver routes read operations among replica set members
by setting a read preference. You can also control how the driver waits for
acknowledgment of read and write operations on a replica set by setting read and
write concerns.

The following sections show how to configure these read and write settings
at various levels.

.. _scala-read-write-client:

Client Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to set the read preference, read concern, and
write concern of a ``MongoClient`` instance by passing a ``MongoClientSettings``
instance to the constructor. The code configures the following settings:

- ``secondary`` read preference: Read operations retrieve data from 
  secondary replica set members.
- ``LOCAL`` read concern: Read operations return the instance's most recent data 
  without guaranteeing that the data has been written to a majority of the replica
  set members.
- ``W2`` write concern: The primary replica set member and one secondary member
  must acknowledge the write operation.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-pref.scala
    :language: scala
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-client-settings
    :end-before: end-client-settings

Alternatively, you can specify the read and write settings in the connection
URI, which is passed as a parameter to the ``MongoClient`` constructor:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-pref.scala
    :language: scala
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-client-settings-uri
    :end-before: end-client-settings-uri

.. _scala-read-write-transaction:

Transaction Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to set the read preference, read concern, and
write concern of a transaction by passing a ``TransactionOptions``
instance to the ``startTransaction()`` method. Transactions run within
*sessions*, which are groupings of related read or write operations that you
intend to run sequentially. Before configuring transaction options, create a
``ClientSession`` instance to start a session.

.. tip::

   To learn more about sessions, see :manual:`Server Sessions </reference/server-sessions/>`
   in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

The example configures the following settings:

- ``primary`` read preference: Read operations retrieve data from 
  the primary replica set member.
- ``MAJORITY`` read concern: Read operations return the instance's most recent data 
  that has been written to a majority of replica set members.
- ``W1`` write concern: The primary replica set member must acknowledge the
  write operation.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-pref.scala
    :language: scala
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-transaction-settings
    :end-before: end-transaction-settings

.. _scala-read-write-database:

Database Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to set the read preference, read concern, and
write concern of a database called ``test_database`` by chaining setter
methods to the ``getDatabase()`` method. The code configures the following
settings:

- ``primaryPreferred`` read preference: Read operations retrieve data from 
  the primary replica set member, or secondary members if the primary is unavailable.
- ``AVAILABLE`` read concern: Read operations return the instance's most recent data 
  without guaranteeing that the data has been written to a majority of the replica
  set members.
- ``MAJORITY`` write concern: The majority of all replica set members
  must acknowledge the write operation.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-pref.scala
    :language: scala
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-database-settings
    :end-before: end-database-settings

.. _scala-read-write-collection:

Collection Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to set the read preference, read concern, and
write concern of a collection called ``test_collection`` by chaining setter
methods to the ``getCollection()`` method. The code configures the following
settings:

- ``secondaryPreferred`` read preference: Read operations retrieve data from 
  secondary replica set members, or the primary members if no secondary members are
  available.
- ``AVAILABLE`` read concern: Read operations return the instance's most recent data 
  without guaranteeing that the data has been written to a majority of the replica
  set members.
- ``UNACKNOWLEDGED`` write concern: Replica set members do not need to acknowledge
  the write operation.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-pref.scala
    :language: scala
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-collection-settings
    :end-before: end-collection-settings

.. _scala-read-write-advanced:

Advanced Read Configurations 
----------------------------

The following sections describe ways to further customize how the {+driver-short+}
reads from replica set members.

.. _scala-tag-sets:

Tag Sets
~~~~~~~~

In {+mdb-server+}, you can apply key-value :manual:`tags
</core/read-preference-tags/>` to replica set members
according to any criteria you choose. You can then use those
tags to target one or more members for a read operation.

By default, the {+driver-short+} ignores tags when choosing a member
to read from. To instruct the {+driver-short+} to prefer certain tags,
pass the tags as a list to your read preference setter method.

Suppose you are connected to a replica set that contains members hosted
at multiple data centers across the United States. You want the driver to
prefer reads from secondary replica set members in the following order:

1. Members from the New York data center, tagged with ``("dc", "ny")``
#. Members from the San Francisco data center, tagged with ``("dc", "sf")``
#. Any secondary members

This code example passes a list of tags representing the preceding replica
set members to the ``ReadPreference.secondary()`` setter method. Then, the code
passes the read preference information to the ``withReadPreference()`` method
to set the read order on the database:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-pref.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-tag-set
   :end-before: end-tag-set

.. _scala-local-threshold:

Local Threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If multiple replica set members match the read preference and tag sets that you specify,
the {+driver-short+} reads from the nearest replica set members, chosen according to
their ping time.

By default, the driver uses only members whose ping times are within 15 milliseconds
of the nearest member for queries. To distribute reads among members with
higher latencies, set the ``localThreshold`` option in a ``MongoClientSettings``
instance or the ``localThresholdMS`` option in your connection URI.

The following example specifies a local threshold of 35 milliseconds. Select 
the :guilabel:`MongoClientSettings` or :guilabel:`Connection URI` tab to see
corresponding code for each approach:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
      :tabid: settings

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-pref.scala
          :language: rust
          :dedent:
          :start-after: start-local-threshold-settings
          :end-before: end-local-threshold-settings

    
    .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: uri

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/read-write-pref.scala
          :language: rust
          :dedent:
          :start-after: start-local-threshold-uri
          :end-before: end-local-threshold-uri

In the preceding example, the {+driver-short+} distributes reads among matching members
within 35 milliseconds of the closest member's ping time.

.. note::
  
   The {+driver-short+} ignores the ``localThresholdMS`` option when communicating with a
   replica set through a ``mongos`` instance. In this case, use the
   :manual:`localThreshold </reference/program/mongos/#std-option-mongos.--localThreshold>`
   command-line option.
