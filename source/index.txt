   Welcome to the documentation for `MongoDB Management Service
   (MMS) <https://mms.mongodb.com/?pk_campaign=mms-docs-homepage>`_. Engineered
   by the team who develops MongoDB, MMS provides cloud-based
   monitoring as well as backup and recovery for MongoDB. MMS users
   can visualize database performance and set custom alerts when

   continuous backup solution for MongoDB, providing point-in-time
   recovery for replica sets and cluster-wide snapshots of sharded
   systems. You can create a free MMS account at `mms.mongodb.com
