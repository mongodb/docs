Documents Tab
-------------

From the :guilabel:`Documents` tab, you can view, insert, clone, modify, and
delete documents.


View Documents
--------------

Use the Documents tab to view individual documents. When the Documents
tab loads, Compass displays all documents that match your query criteria
(or all documents within the sample if no query criteria was
specified).

Insert Documents
----------------

Click the :guilabel:`Insert Document` button to insert a new document:

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-button.png
  :figwidth: 800px

The insert dialog appears:

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document.png
  :figwidth: 598px

For each field in the document, select field type and fill in the
field name and value.

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document2.png
  :figwidth: 627px

.. tip::

   For the field values, you can paste valid JSON that can be parsed by
   JavaScript's ``JSON.parse``.
   
   - If the pasted JSON is an Array, the first character must be a left
     bracket ``[`` and the last character must be a right bracket ``]``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        [ "first", "second", 3 ]
   
   - If the pasted JSON is an Object (i.e. a document), the keys must
     be quoted in double quotes and are permitted to be escaped. The
     first character must be left curly brace ``{`` and the last must
     be right curly brace ``}``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          "email": "test@example.com",
          "phone": "555-555-1212"
        }

Add New Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new field for the document, hover over the row number in the
dialog (the row number is not part of the document but the dialog
display) and click on the plus sign add a new field after the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document-new-field.svg
  :figwidth: 621px

You can also add a new field at the end by hitting the Tab from the
value of the last field.

.. tip::

   To add a new field after an array or a document field, hover over
   the row number in the dialog (the row number is not part of the
   document but the dialog display) and click on the plus sign add a

Change Field Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change the data type of a field by using the data type
selectors on the right of the field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/insert-document3.png
  :figwidth: 644px

To change the ``_id`` field to use a custom value, change
the data type from ``ObjectID`` to ``string`` and then overwrite the
``_id`` value:

Clone Documents
---------------

It is also possible to insert new documents by cloning
the schema and values of an existing document in a collection.

To clone a document, hover over the desired document
and click the :guilabel:`Clone` button.

.. figure:: /images/compass/clone-doc.png
  :figwidth: 740px

This creates a new insert dialog with the same schema
and values. You can edit any of these fields and values before
you insert the new document.

Modify Documents
----------------

To edit a document, hover over the document and select the pencil icon:

.. figure:: /images/compass/edit-doc.png
  :figwidth: 740px

After you click the pencil icon, the document enters edit mode:

You can now make changes to the fields, values, or data types
of values.

.. tip::

   JavaScript's ``JSON.parse``.
   
   - If the pasted JSON is an Array, the first character must be a left
     bracket ``[`` and the last character must be a right bracket ``]``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        [ "first", "second", 3 ]
   
   - If the pasted JSON is an Object (i.e. a document), the keys must
     be quoted in double quotes and are permitted to be escaped. The
     first character must be left curly brace ``{`` and the last must
     be right curly brace ``}``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {

          "phone": "555-555-1212"
        }

.. figure:: /images/compass/update-field.png
  :figwidth: 740px

When you are finished editing the document, click the ``Update`` button

.. figure:: /images/compass/delete-doc.png
  :figwidth: 740px

.. figure:: /images/compass/delete-doc2.png
  :figwidth: 740px

After you confirm, Compass deletes the document
from the collection.
