"However, when creating backups from a sharded cluster it is important that "
"you disable the balancer while taking backups to ensure that no chunk "
"migrations affect the content of the backup captured by the backup "
"procedure. Using the procedure outlined in the section :ref:`sharding-"
"balancing-disable-temporarily` you can manually stop the balancer process "
"temporarily. As an alternative you can use this procedure to define a "
"balancing window so that the balancer is always disabled during your "
"automated backup operation."

"不过,在对集群进行备份时,关闭均衡过程以防止对备份的数据造成影响是很重要的."

"This operation configures the balancer to run between 6:00am and 11:00pm, "

"这个配置使得集群只在6:00am到11:00pm之间运行均衡过程."
"安排你的备份计划,使其 *整个流程时间* 都不在这个范围内."
"这样均衡与备份才不会相互干扰."
