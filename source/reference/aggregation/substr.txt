=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. expression:: $substr

   :expression:`$substr` takes a string and two numbers. The first
   number represents the number of bytes in the string to skip,
   and the second number specifies the number of bytes to return
   from the string.

   .. note::

      :expression:`$substr` is not encoding aware and if used
      improperly may produce a result string containing an invalid UTF-8
      character sequence.
