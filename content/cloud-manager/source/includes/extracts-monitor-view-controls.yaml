ref: monitor-view-control-granularity
content: |

  Modifies the granularity of metrics displayed for each chart.
  Select a granularity between 1 minute and 1 day (24 hours).
  Select ``Auto`` to automatically adjust the granularity based
  on the selected :guilabel:`Zoom` or :guilabel:`Current Display`
  date controls. ``Auto`` granularity selects the highest fidelity
  granularity available for the time range.

ref: monitor-view-control-granularity-sharded
content: |

  Modifies the granularity of metrics displayed for each chart.
  Select a granularity between 1 minute and 1 day (24 hours).
  Select ``Auto`` to automatically adjust the granularity based
  on the selected :guilabel:`Zoom` or :guilabel:`Current Display`
  date controls.

  ``Auto`` granularity selects the highest fidelity
  granularity available within the selected time range and sharded
  cluster metric rendering limits.

  In the Sharded Cluster metrics view, |mms| renders a maximum of:
      
  - 3,000 data points for a single series, and
  - 100,000 total data points.
     
  As a result, when rendering metrics for large deployments over a
  long period of time, |mms| may display metrics at a lower
  granularity than is retained.

  For example, for Premium |mms| users, |mms| retains data for the past
  year with a granularity of 1 hour. A year's worth of data
  results in ``365`` days * ``24`` hours, or ``8760`` data
  points per data series. Therefore, when rendering a year
  of historical metrics, |mms| renders the chart at a lower
  granularity because it can only render a maximum 3,000
  data points for a single series.

  The granularity at which |mms| gathers and stores metric data
  depends on your |mms| plan. To learn more about metric data
  granularity, see :ref:`monitoring-metrics-per-plan`.

ref: monitor-view-control-zoom
content: |

  Modifies the date range of metrics displayed for each chart. 
  Select a zoom range between 1 hour and 5 years. Adjusting
  the :guilabel:`Zoom` automatically adjusts the
  :guilabel:`Current Display` date range. 

---
ref: monitor-view-control-current-display
content: |

  Modifies the start and end date-time range of metrics displayed 
  for each chart. Modifying the start and end date sets the 
  value of :guilabel:`Zoom` to ``custom`` and overrides the
  previously selected zoom level.

ref: monitor-view-control-toggle-members
content: |

  Limit charts to the selected replica set members. The
  ``P`` icon represents the :manual:`primary </reference/glossary/#std-term-primary>` replica set member,
  while the ``S`` icon represents a :manual:`secondary </reference/glossary/#std-term-secondary>`
  member.

ref: monitor-view-control-add-chart
content: |

  Select one or more charts to display or hide. Adding
  charts using this dropdown is identical to adding charts
  from the :guilabel:`Toggle Charts` section of the 
  :guilabel:`Metrics` view.

---
ref: monitor-view-control-display-opcounters
content: |

  Directs |mms| to split the :guilabel:`Opcounters`
  chart into its individual components. You can then choose
  to chart one or more of those components.

---
ref: monitor-view-control-display-annotations
content: |
  
  Directs |mms| to display or hide chart annotations. 
  Chart annotations consist of colored vertical lines that 
  indicate server events, such as a server restart or 
  a transition in member state.
---
ref: monitor-view-control-display-data
content: |

  Directs |mms| to display data based on the selected options

  - ``Individually`` - displays the selected metrics for each shard as an individual line.

  - ``Sum`` - displays the sum of the selected metrics across all shards in the deployment.

  - ``Averaged`` - displays the average of the selected metrics across all shards in the deployment.
---
ref: monitor-view-control-display
content: |
  
  Selects which metric to chart. You can display no more than
  one chart at a time. 
---
ref: monitor-view-control-view
content: |
  
  Selects which sharded cluster components to display
  
  - ``SHARDS`` - displays metrics for each shard in the sharded cluster deployment.
  
  - ``MONGOS`` - displays metrics for each :binary:`bin.mongos` in the sharded cluster deployment.
  
  - ``CONFIGS`` - displays metrics for the config server in the sharded cluster config server replica set.
---
ref: monitor-view-control-select-database
content: |
  
  - :guilabel:`Select Database`
  
  - Only visible for the :guilabel:`DB Stats` view. Selects
    the database for which to display metrics.
