Overview
--------

|mms| integrates with Microsoft Azure so that you can provision servers
directly from the |mms| interface. When you provision servers, |mms|
automatically installs the Automation Agent on each, making them available
to host MongoDB deployments.

In general, provision one server per :program:`mongod` process. For
MongoDB deployment architectures, see :manual:`Replica Set Architectures
</core/replica-set-architectures>` and :manual:`Sharded Cluster
Architectures </core/sharded-cluster-architectures>` in the MongoDB
manual.

Prerequisites
-------------

You or an administrator must :doc:`configure integration with Azure
</tutorial/configure-azure-integration>`.

You must have at least one SSH public key stored on the :guilabel:`Provisioning Settings`
page, accessed through the :guilabel:`Settings` tab. You will use
the key when logging in to the provisioned servers.
