.. dbcommand:: drop

   The :dbcommand:`drop` command removes an entire collection from a
   database. The command has following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { drop: <collection_name>, writeConcern: <document>, comment: <any> }

   The command takes the following fields:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 80

      * - Field
        - Description

      * - ``drop``
        - The name of the collection to drop.

      * - ``writeConcern``

        - Optional. A document expressing the :doc:`write concern
          </reference/write-concern>` of the :dbcommand:`drop` command.
          Omit to use the default write concern.

      * - ``comment``

   The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the equivalent helper method
   :method:`db.collection.drop()`.

Behavior
--------

- Starting in MongoDB 5.0, the :dbcommand:`drop` command and the
  :method:`db.collection.drop()` method will raise an error if passed an
  unrecognized parameter. In MongoDB 4.4 and earlier, unrecognized 
  parameters are silently ignored.

- This command also removes any indexes associated with the dropped
  collection.

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-drop-in-progress-indexes.rst

- The :dbcommand:`drop` command and its helper
  :method:`db.collection.drop()` create an :ref:`change-event-invalidate`
  for any :doc:`/changeStreams` opened on the dropped collection.
