msgid "Range-based sharding involves dividing data into contiguous ranges determined by the shard key values. In this model, documents with \"close\" shard key values are likely to be in the same :term:`chunk` or :term:`shard`. This allows for efficient queries where reads target documents within a contiguous range. However, both read and write performance may decrease with poor shard key selection. See :ref:`sharding-ranged-shard-key`."
