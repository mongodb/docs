.. The BI Connector team derives
.. the links to the release notes based on the assumption that we'll
.. use the following heading format: |bi| x.x.x

.. When you add notes for a new release, you **must** use that
.. formatting for the H3 so that the rendered target is the format they
.. expect and we don't break the links on the downloads page.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pushdown
````````

This release includes a number of improvements to pushdown. Existing
translations were improved and expanded pushdown coverage to more
functions and query shapes.

- Adds support for pushing down correlated subqueries to MongoDB
  versions 3.6 and later.

- Adds pushdown support for ``ln``, ``ascii``, ``user``, ``database``,
  ``version``, ``connection_id``, and constant-valued time/date
  functions.

- Adds support for pushing down ``regexp`` to the aggregation language.

- Removes some unnecessary rounding from pushdown translations.

- Adds support for pushing down ``LIKE`` expressions with literal
  pattern strings to the aggregation language.

- Improves the efficiency of pipelines generated for ``EXISTS``
  subqueries.

- Improves truncate pushdown coverage and updated the translation to use
  :operator:`$trunc` with MongoDB versions 4.1.9 and later.

- Adds pushdown support for the ``char`` and ``str_to_date`` functions.

Go Driver
`````````

This release includes a number of improvements made possible by
upgrading to the new go driver:

- Adds support for SRV URI support to :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` and
  :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`.

- Adds MongoDB URI support to :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` via a
  ``--uri`` flag.

- Adds support for zlib and snappy compression for connections to
  MongoDB.

- Updates :ref:`DRDL <schema-with-drdl-file>` file parsing to support
  the most recent version of the extjson spec.

Behavioral Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds new reserved words to the parser: ``INSERT``, ``INTO``, ``KEY``,
  ``FULLTEXT``, and ``PRIMARY``.

  Going forward, these words must be wrapped in backticks to be used as
  identifiers in queries.

- Removes support for altering sampled schema with ``ALTER TABLE``
  statements.

- Prior to 2.12, :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` supported renaming and
  removing tables and columns via a modified ``ALTER TABLE`` syntax when
  in :ref:`standalone schema mode <sampling-mode-chart>`. Any customer
  currently using this feature is advised to migrate their schema
  management needs to :ref:`views <schema-with-views>`,
  :ref:`DRDL <schema-with-drdl-file>`, or
  :ref:`custom schema mode <sampling-mode-chart>`. The variable/config
  parameter that enabled this feature, ``enable_table_alterations``, is
  still supported but doesn’t do anything in |bi-short| 2.12. It will be
  removed in a future release.

.. _bi-2-11-1:

|bi| 2.11.1
-----------

*Released July 8, 2019*

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Fixes a bug that caused the MySQL schema to include incorrect foreign
key constraints.

Fixes a bug that caused incorrect pushdown for some very large or very
small ``date`` and ``datetime`` values.

Fixes a bug that caused aliases to be ignored for tables in the
``information_schema`` database.

.. _bi-2-11-0:

|bi| 2.11.0
-----------

*Released May 16, 2019*

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds a number of optimizations that are applied to generated
  aggregation pipelines before sending them to MongoDB.

- Adds new subcommands to :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` for storing a
  ``DRDL`` file in MongoDB and for manipulating stored schemas.

- Enables :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` to use stored ``DRDL`` schemas instead
  of sampling. To learn more, see :ref:`2.11-schema-management-changes`.

- Introduces the beta version of :binary:`~bin.mongotranslate`, a
  command-line utility that can translate SQL queries to
  aggregation pipelines without a running |bi-short| or MongoDB
  instance.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes a problem that caused the |bi-short| to generate unnecessarily
  long ``$group`` key names.

- Fixes a bug that caused the |bi-short| to generate incorrect table
  pipelines in
  :ref:`polymorphic schema mapping mode <system-environment-variables>`.

- Fixes a bug that caused the |bi-short| to panic when printing some
  query plans.

- Fixes a bug where the |bi-short|’s in-memory evaluation of
  string-to-date conversions did not match the pushdown behavior.

- Updates the supported Amazon Linux version to match the version
  supported by MongoDB 4.2.

- Fixes a bug with Active Directory constrained delegation in the
  |bi-short|’s GSSAPI implementation (linux and macOS).

- Introduces a ``--gssapiConstrainedDelegation`` flag that must be enabled
  to ensure existing Kerberos configurations are not broken.

- Fixes a bug that caused Kerberos authentication to fail with a linux
  :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`, MongoDB 4.0, and an Active Directory KDC.

- Fixes a number of small bugs related to correlated subqueries.

Chages/Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changes some schema-management configuration options.

- Deprecates schema-modification support via ``ALTER TABLE``, as well as
  the ``enable_table_alterations`` :ref:`system variable <system-environment-variables>` and
  :xml:`<mono><link target="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#setparameter-option">setParameter</link></mono>`.

.. _bi-2-10-0:

|bi| 2.10.0
-----------

*Released Mar 15, 2019*

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes a bug where aggregate functions returned ``NULL`` in dual
  queries with the ``DUAL`` keyword omitted.

- Fixes a bug where some invalid ``DUAL`` queries did not return an
  error.

- Fixes a bug that prevented pushdown of some joins to derived tables
  selecting from ``DUAL``.

- Fixes some correctness bugs in the in-memory evaluation for 
  :doc:`mysql-mode conversions </reference/type-conversion/>`.

- Fixes a bug where some trig functions (``ascii``, ``acos``, and
  ``asin``) could return incorrect results due to missing
  :ref:`type conversions <type-conversion-modes>`.

- Fixes a bug where some subquery comparisons could return incorrect
  results due to missing
  :ref:`type conversions <type-conversion-modes>`.

- Fixes a bug where we lost precision while converting a ``Uint64`` to a
  ``Decimal``.

- Fixes a correctness bug with the ``INSERT`` scalar function's pushdown
  translation.

- Fixes a bug where unstable sorting caused non-deterministic renaming
  of colliding collection/field names during schema mapping.

- Fixes a bug where some valid subquery comparisons returned errors.

- Fixes a bug where some valid subquery and tuple comparisons returned
  errors.

- Fixes a bug where queries using ``xor`` returned errors on MongoDB 3.2
  because the generated pipelines required features added in MongoDB
  3.4.

- Fixes a bug that caused kerberos
  :ref:`authentication <client-authentication>` to fail with MongoDB
  4.0.

Date and Time Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release resolves a number of inconsistencies in the |bi-short|'s
date and timestamp semantics. Resolving these inconsistencies resulted
in some changes to user-facing behavior:

- Removes inconsistent support for partial dates.

  - MySQL can represent partial dates that are
    `missing month or day components <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/date-and-time-functions.html>`__.
    It is impossible to represent these incomplete dates with
    MongoDB dates. Attempting to correctly manipulate and render
    incomplete dates was causing a number of bugs and inconsistencies
    with complete dates.

  - Starting with version 2.10, the |bi-short| does not support
    operations on or expressions that return incomplete dates.
    Going forward, we cannot provide guarantees about the behavior of
    operations that attempt to construct incomplete dates.

- Updates the ``DATE(a)`` and ``TIMESTAMP(a)`` scalar functions to be
  equivalent to ``CAST(a AS DATE)``, and ``CAST(a AS DATETIME)``,
  respectively.

  - The behavior of the ``DATE`` and ``TIMESTAMP`` scalar functions will
    depend on the value of the ``type_conversion_mode`` variable. This
    will change the default behavior for those scalar functions.

  - Queries affected by this change can be rewritten to use a more
    explicit conversion function (such as ``str_to_date``) that does not
    depend on ``type_conversion_mode``. If an affected query cannot be
    rewritten, a user may set ``type_conversion_mode`` variable to
    ``mysql``, which instructs the BI Connector to perform all type
    conversions with MySQL semantics instead of MongoDB semantics.

    .. important::

       This is discouraged unless absolutely necessary, as it
       significantly curtails the ability to push down type conversions
       across the board.

  - For more information on type conversions and the
    ``type_conversion_mode`` system variable, see
    :ref:`Type Conversion Modes <type-conversion-modes>`.
