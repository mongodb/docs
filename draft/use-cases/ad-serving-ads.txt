Online Advertising: Ad Serving
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

This document outlines the basic patterns and principless for using
MongoDB as a persistent storage engine for an online advertising network. In
particular, this document focuses on the task of deciding *which* ad to serve
when a user visits a particular site.

Problem
~~~~~~~

You want to create an advertising network that will serve ads to a variety of
online media sites. As part of this ad serving, you want to track which ads are
available to be served, and decide on a particular ad to be served in a
particular zone.

Solution
~~~~~~~~

This solution is structured as a progressive refinement of the ad network,
starting out with the basic data storage requirements and adding more advanced
features to the schema to support more advanced ad targeting. The key performance
criterion for this solution is the latency between receiving an ad request and
returning the (targeted) ad to be displayed.

The examples that follow use the Python programming language and the
:api:`PyMongo <python/current>` :term:`driver` for MongoDB, but you
can implement this system using any language you choose.

Design 1: Basic Ad Serving
--------------------------

A basic ad serving algorithm consists of the following steps:

#. The network receives a request for an ad, specifying at a minimum the
   ``site_id`` and ``zone_id`` to be served.
#. The network consults its inventory of ads available to display and chooses an
   ad based on various business rules.
#. The network returns the actual ad to be displayed, possibly recording the
   decision made as well.

This design uses the ``site_id`` and ``zone_id`` submitted with the ad request,
as well as information stored in the ad inventory collection, to make the ad
targeting decisions. Later examples will build on this, allowing more advanced ad
targeting.

Schema Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A very basic schema for storing ads available to be served consists of a single
collection, ``ad.zone``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: ObjectId(...),
     site_id: 'cnn',
     zone_id: 'banner',
     ads: [
       { campaign_id: 'mercedes:c201204_sclass_4',
         ad_unit_id: 'banner23a',
         ecpm: 250 },
       { campaign_id: 'mercedes:c201204_sclass_4',
         ad_unit_id: 'banner23b',
         ecpm: 250 },
       { campaign_id: 'bmw:c201204_eclass_1',
         ad_unit_id: 'banner12',
         ecpm: 200 },
       ... ]
   }

Note that for each (``site``, ``zone``) combination you'll be storing a list of
ads, sorted by their ``ecpm`` values.

Choosing an Ad to Serve
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The query you'll use to choose which ad to serve selects a compatible ad and
sorts by the advertiser's ``ecpm`` bid in order to maximize the ad network's
profits:

.. code-block:: python

   from itertools import groupby
   from random import choice

   def choose_ad(site_id, zone_id):
       site = db.ad.zone.find_one({
           'site_id': site_id, 'zone_id': zone_id})
       if site is None: return None
       if len(site['ads']) == 0: return None
       ecpm_groups = groupby(site['ads'], key=lambda ad:ad['ecpm'])
       ecpm, ad_group = ecpm_groups.next()
       return choice(list(ad_group))

Index Support
`````````````

In order to execute the ad choice with the lowest latency possible, you'll want
to have a compound index on (``site_id``, ``zone_id``):

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> db.ad.zone.ensure_index([
   ...     ('site_id', 1),
   ...     ('zone_id', 1) ])

Making an Ad Campaign Inactive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One case you'll have to deal with in this solution making a campaign
inactive. This may happen for a variety of reasons. For instance, the campaign
may have reached its end date or exhausted its budget for the current time
period. In this case, the logic is fairly straightforward:

.. code-block:: python

   def deactivate_campaign(campaign_id):
       db.ad.zone.update(
         { 'ads.campaign_id': campaign_id },
         {' $pull': { 'ads', { 'campaign_id': campaign_id } } },
         multi=True)

The update statement above first selects only those ad zones which had avaialable
ads from the given ``campaign_id`` and then uses the ``$pull`` modifier to remove
them from rotation.

Index Support
`````````````

In order to execute the multi-update quickly, you should maintain an index on the
``ads.campaign_id`` field:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> db.ad.zone.ensure_index('ads.campaign_id')

Sharding
~~~~~~~~

In order to scale beyond the capacity of a single replica set, you will need to
shard the ``ad.zone`` collection. To maintain the lowest possible latency in
the ad selection operation, the :term:`shard key` needs to be chosen to allow
MongoDB to route the ``ad.zone`` query to a single shard. In this case, a
good approach is to shard on the (``site_id``, ``zone_id``) combination:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> db.command('shardcollection', 'ad.zone', {
   ...     'key': {'site_id': 1, 'zone_id': 1} })
   { "collectionsharded": "ad.zone", "ok": 1 }

Design 2: Adding Frequency Capping
----------------------------------

One problem with the logic described in Design 1 above is that it will tend to
display the same ad over and over again until the campaign's budget is
exhausted. To mitigate this, advertisers may wish to limit the frequency with
which a given user is presented a particular ad. This process is called frequency
capping and is an example of user profile targeting in advertising.

In order to perform frequency capping (or any type of user targeting), the ad
network needs to maintain a profile for each visitor, typically implemented as a
cookie in the user's browser. This cookie, effectively a ``user_id``, is then
transmitted to the ad network when logging impressions, clicks, conversions,
etc., as well as the ad serving decision. This section focuses on how that
profile data impacts the ad serving decision.

Schema Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use the user profile data, you need to store it. In this case, it's
stored in a collection ``ad.user``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: 'cookie_value',
     advertisers: {
       mercedes: {
         impressions: [
           { date: ISODateTime(...),
             campaign: 'c201204_sclass_4',
             ad_unit_id: 'banner23a',
             site_id: 'cnn',
             zone_id: 'banner' } },
           ... ],
         clicks: [
           { date: ISODateTime(...),
             campaign: 'c201204_sclass_4',
             ad_unit_id: 'banner23a',
             site_id: 'cnn',
             zone_id: 'banner' } },
         ... ],
       bmw: [ ... ],
       ...
     }
   }

There are a few things to note about the user profile:

- Profile information is segmented by advertiser. Typically advertising data is
  sensitive competitive infomration that can't be shared among advertisers, so
  this must be kept separate.
- All data is embedded in a single profile document. When you need to query this
  data (detailed below), you don't necessarily know which advertiser's ads you'll
  be showing, so it's a good practice to embed all advertisers in a single
  document.
- The event information is grouped by event type within an advertiser, and sorted
  by timestamp. This allows rapid lookups of a stream of a particular type of
  event.

Choosing an Ad to Serve
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The query you'll use to choose which ad to serve now needs to iterate through
ads in order of desireability and select the "best" ad that also satisfies the
advertiser's targeting rules (in this case, the frequency cap):

.. code-block:: python

   from itertools import groupby
   from random import shuffle
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   def choose_ad(site_id, zone_id, user_id):
      site = db.ad.zone.find_one({
           'site_id': site_id, 'zone_id': zone_id})
      if site is None or len(site['ads']) == 0: return None
      ads = ad_iterator(site['ads'])
      user = db.ad.user.find_one({'user_id': user_id})
      if user is None:
          # any ad is acceptable for an unknown user
          return ads.next()
      for ad in ads:
          advertiser_id = ad['campaign_id'].split(':', 1)[0]
          if ad_is_acceptable(ad, user[advertiser_id]):
              return ad
      return None

   def ad_iterator(ads):
       '''Find available ads, sorted by ecpm, with random sort for ties'''
       ecpm_groups = groupby(ads, key=lambda ad:ad['ecpm'])
       for ecpm, ad_group in ecpm_groups:
           ad_group = list(ad_group)
           shuffle(ad_group)
           for ad in ad_group: yield ad

   def ad_is_acceptable(ad, profile):
       '''Returns False if the user has seen the ad today'''
       threshold = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=1)
       for event in reversed(profile['impressions']):
           if event['timestamp'] < threshold: break
           if event['detail']['ad_unit_id'] == ad['ad_unit_id']:
               return False
       return True

Here, the ``chose_ad()`` function provides the framework for your ad selection
process. The ``site`` is fetched first, and then passed to the ``ad_iterator()``
function which will yield ads in order of desirability. Each ad is then checked
using the ``ad_is_acceptable()`` function to determine if it meets the
advertiser's rules.

The ``ad_is_acceptable()`` function then iterates over all the ``impressions``
stored in the user profile, from most recent to oldest, within a certain
``thresold`` time period (shown here as 1 day). If the same ``ad_unit_id``
appears in the mipression stream, the ad is rejected. Otherwise it is acceptable
and can be shown to the user.

Index Support
`````````````

In order to retrieve the user profile with the lowest latency possible, there
needs to be an index on the ``_id`` field, which MongoDB supplies by default.

Sharding
~~~~~~~~

When sharding the ``ad.user`` collection, choosing the ``_id`` field as a
:term:`shard key` allows MongoDB to route queries and updates to the profile:

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> db.command('shardcollection', 'ad.user', {
   ...     'key': {'_id': 1 } })
   { "collectionsharded": "ad.user", "ok": 1 }

Design 3: Keyword Targeting
---------------------------

Where frequency capping above is an example of user profile targeting, you may
also wish to perform content targeting so that the user receives relevant ads for
the particular page being viewed. The simplest example of this is targeting ads
at the result of a search query. In this case, a list of ``keywords`` is sent to
the ``choose_ad()`` call along with the ``site_id``, ``zone_id``, and
``user_id``.


Schema Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to choose relevant ads, you'll need to expand the ``ad.zone`` collection
to store keywords for each ad:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: ObjectId(...),
     site_id: 'cnn',
     zone_id: 'search',
     ads: [
       { campaign_id: 'mercedes:c201204_sclass_4',
         ad_unit_id: 'search1',
         keywords: [ 'car', 'luxury', 'style' ],
         ecpm: 250 },
       { campaign_id: 'mercedes:c201204_sclass_4',
         ad_unit_id: 'search2',
         keywords: [ 'car', 'luxury', 'style' ],
         ecpm: 250 },
       { campaign_id: 'bmw:c201204_eclass_1',
         ad_unit_id: 'search1',
         keywords: [ 'car', 'performance' ],
         ecpm: 200 },
       ... ]
   }

Choosing a Group of Ads to Serve
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the approach described here, you'll choose a number of ads that match the
keywords used in the search, so the code below has been modified to return an
iterator over ads in descending order of preference:

.. code-block:: python

   def choose_ads(site_id, zone_id, user_id, keywords):
      site = db.ad.zone.find_one({
           'site_id': site_id, 'zone_id': zone_id})
      if site is None: return []
      ads = ad_iterator(site['ads'], keywords)
      user = db.ad.user.find_one({'user_id': user_id})
      if user is None: return ads
      advertiser_ids = (
          ad['campaign_id'].split(':', 1)[0]
          for ad in ads )
      return (
          ad for ad, advertiser_id in izip(
              ads, advertiser_ids)
          if ad_is_acceptible(ad, user[advertiser_id]) )

  def ad_iterator(ads, keywords):
       '''Find available ads, sorted by score, with random sort for ties'''
       keywords = set(keywords)
       scored_ads = [
           (ad_score(ad, keywords), ad)
           for ad in ads ]
       score_groups = groupby(
           sorted(scored_ads), key=lambda score, ad: score)
       for score, ad_group in score_groups:
           ad_group = list(ad_group)
           shuffle(ad_group)
           for ad in ad_group: yield ad

  def ad_score(ad, keywords):
      '''Compute a desirability score based on the ad ecpm and keywords'''
      matching = set(ad['keywords']).intersection(keywords)
      return ad['ecpm'] * math.log(
          1.1 + len(matching))

  def ad_is_acceptible(ad, profile):
      # same as above

The main thing to note in the code above is that a must now be sorted according
to some ``score`` which in this case is computed based on a combination of the
``ecpm`` of the ad as well as the number of keywords matched. More advanced use
cases may boost the importance of various keywords, but this goes beyond the
scope of this use case. One thing to keep in mind is that the fact that ads are
now being sorted at ad display time may cause performance issues if there are are
large number of ads competing for the same display slot.
