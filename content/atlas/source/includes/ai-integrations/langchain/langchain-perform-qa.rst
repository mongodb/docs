   .. tab:: RAG with Filtering
      :tabid: langchain-rag-filtering

      This example does the following:

      - Instantiates {+avs+} as a `retriever 
        <https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#retrievers/>`__
        to query for similar documents, including the following optional parameters:
         
        - ``k`` to search for only the ``10`` most relevant documents.
        - ``score_threshold`` to use only documents with a relevance score above ``0.75``.

          .. note::

             This parameter refers to a relevance score that Langchain uses
             to normalize your results, and not the :ref:`relevance score <scoring-ref>`
             used in |fts| queries. To use |fts| scores in your |rag| implementation,
             define a custom retriever that uses the ``similarity_search_with_score`` method 
             and filters by the |fts| score.
           
        - ``pre_filter`` to filter on the ``page_label`` field for documents that appear on page 2 only.
