The |k8s-op-full| translates the human knowledge of creating a MongoDB
instance into a scalable, repeatable, and standardized method.
|k8s| needs help creating and managing stateful applications like
databases. It needs to configure the network, persist storage, and
dedicate computing capacity without additional human effort on each
container.

The |k8s-op-short| manages the typical lifecycle events for a MongoDB
cluster: provisioning storage and computing power, configuring network
connections, setting up users, and changing these settings as needed.
It accomplishes this using the Kubernetes API and tools.

You provide the |k8s-op-full| with the specifications for your MongoDB
cluster. The |k8s-op-full| uses this information to specify to |k8s| how to
configure that cluster including provisioning storage, setting up the
network connections, and configuring other resources.

The |k8s-op-full| works together with MongoDB |com|, which further
configures to MongoDB clusters. When MongoDB is deployed and running in
|k8s|, you can manage MongoDB tasks using |com|.

You can then deploy MongoDB databases as you deploy them now after the
cluster is created. You can use the |com| console to run MongoDB at
optimal performance.
