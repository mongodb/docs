============================
Add Entries to the Whitelist
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

|service| only allows client connections to the cluster from entries in the
project's whitelist. Each entry is either a single IP address, a CIDR-notated
range of addresses, or if using :ref:`VPC Peering <vpc-peering>`, a Security
Group associated with the peer VPC.

For |service| clusters deployed on :ref:`google-gcp` or
:ref:`microsoft-azure`, add the IP addresses of your :abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud
Platform)` or :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)` services to |service| project IP
whitelist to grant those services access to the cluster.

The whitelist applies to all clusters in the project and can have up to 200
whitelist entries, with the following exception: projects with an existing
sharded cluster created *before* August 25th, 2017 can have up to 100
whitelist entries.

To add an entry to the whitelist, from the :guilabel:`Clusters` view,
select the :guilabel:`Security` tab, then click :guilabel:`IP
Whitelist`, then :guilabel:`Add IP Address`.
