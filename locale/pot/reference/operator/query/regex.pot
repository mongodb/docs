msgid ":query:`$regex` can only use an :term:`index <index>` efficiently when the regular expression has an anchor for the beginning (i.e. ``^``) of a string and is a case-sensitive match.  Additionally, while ``/^a/``, ``/^a.*/``, and ``/^a.*$/`` match equivalent strings, they have different performance characteristics. All of these expressions use an index if an appropriate index exists; however, ``/^a.*/``, and ``/^a.*$/`` are slower. ``/^a/`` can stop scanning after matching the prefix."
