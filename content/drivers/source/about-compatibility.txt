MongoDB Compatibility Tables
============================

.. meta::
   :description: Explore compatibility tables for MongoDB drivers, detailing server, language, and component compatibility to ensure operational environments.

.. facet::
   :name: genre
   :values: reference

We include compatibility tables for each version of the driver to guide
your decisions on what versions you need to ensure your environment
remains fully operational.

We maintain the following tables for each driver:

- :ref:`MongoDB compatibility <mongodb-compatibility-tables>`
- :ref:`Language compatibility <language-compatibility-tables>`

.. important:: Locating Compatibility Tables

   Each :driver:`driver's documentation </>` contains compatibility
   tables for that specific driver. After navigating to a driver
   documentation site, select the :guilabel:`Compatibility` entry from
   the left-hand navigation to view the MongoDB and language
   compatibility details for that driver.

Read the following sections for explanations of these tables.

MongoDB Compatibility Tables
----------------------------

In the **MongoDB Compatibility** tables, the columns are labeled with
versions of MongoDB server and the rows are labeled with major release
versions of the driver.

The check marks (✓) indicate that the driver can access **all the
features** of that specific version of MongoDB server unless those features
have been deprecated or removed.

The circled asterisks (⊛) indicate that the driver version works with
that specific version of MongoDB server, but may not be able to access all
the features.

If you are **upgrading your server version**, check whether your current driver
version is compatible. We recommend using the newest compatible driver when
upgrading your server version.

If you are **upgrading your driver version**, you can use the table to
identify which version you need to access all the newest features included
in a specific version of the server. Also note that any of the minor
or patch versions share the same compatibility as the major version
release.

We recommend that you avoid using older versions of the drivers that do not
appear on the chart because they are unsupported.

.. _language-compatibility-tables:

Language Compatibility Tables
-----------------------------

In the **Language Compatibility** tables, the columns are labeled with
versions of the language (e.g. Node.js, Python, etc.) and the rows are
labeled with major release versions of the driver.

The check marks (✓) indicate that the code in the driver is fully
compatible with the version of the language.

Component Compatibility Tables
------------------------------

In the **Component Compatibility** tables, the columns indicate versions of
the driver, and the rows indicate the component package names.

The table cells indicate which versions of the component packages are
compatible with the driver version specified in that column.

If the table cell value is blank, the component package is incompatible with
the version of the driver version specified in that column.
