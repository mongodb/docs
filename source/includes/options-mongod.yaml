  The maximum amount of time in milliseconds that

  On MMAPv1, if the journal is on a different block device (e.g. physical
  volume, RAID device, or LVM volume) than the data files, the default journal
  commit interval is 30 milliseconds. Additionally, on MMAPv1, when a write
  operation with ``j:true`` is pending, {{program}} will reduce
  :setting:`~storage.journal.commitIntervalMs` to a third of the set value.

  On WiredTiger, the default journal commit interval is 100 milliseconds. Additionally,
  a write with ``j:true`` will cause an immediate sync of the journal.

  .. versionadded:: 3.4

     Allows the {{program}} to accept and create authenticated and
     non-authenticated connections to and from other :program:`mongod`
     and :program:`mongos` instances in the deployment. Used for
     performing rolling transition of replica sets or sharded clusters
     from a no-auth configuration to :ref:`internal authentication
     <inter-process-auth>`. Requires specifying a :ref:`internal
     authentication <inter-process-auth>` mechanism such as
     :option:`--keyfile`.

  For example, if using :ref:`keyfiles <internal-auth-keyfile>` for
  :ref:`internal authentication <inter-process-auth>`, the {{program}} creates
  an authenticated connection with any :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos`
  in the deployment using a matching keyfile. If the security mechanisms do
  not match, the {{program}} utilizes a non-authenticated connection instead.

  A {{program}} running with {{role}} does not enforce :ref:`user access
  controls <authorization>`. Users may connect to your deployment without any
  access control checks and perform read, write, and administrative operations.

  .. note::
    
     A {{program}} running with :ref:`internal authentication
     <inter-process-auth>` and *without* {{role}} requires clients to connect
     using :ref:`user access controls <authorization>`. Update clients to
     connect to the {{program}} using the appropriate :ref:`user <users>`

description: |
  .. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.
  
  A {{program}} running with {{role}} redacts any message accompanying a given
  log event before logging. This prevents the {{program}} from writing
  potentially sensitive data stored on the database to the diagnostic log.
  Metadata such as error or operation codes, line numbers, and source file
  names are still visible in the logs.
  
  Use {{role}} in conjunction with :doc:`encryption
  </core/security-encryption>` to assist compliance with regulatory
  requirements.
  
  For example, a MongoDB deployment might store Personally Identifiable
  Information (PII) in one or more collections. The {{program}} logs events
  such as those related to CRUD operations, sharding metadata, etc. It is
  possible that the {{program}} may expose PII as a part of these logging
  operations. A {{program}} running with {{role}} removes any message
  accompanying these events before being output to the log, effectively
  removing the PII.
  
  Diagnostics on a {{program}} running with {{role}} may be more difficult
  due to the lack of data related to a log event. See the 
  :ref:`process logging <monitoring-log-redaction>` manual page for an 
  example of the effect of {{role}} on log output.
  
  You can enable or disable log redaction on a running {{program}}
  using the :dbcommand:`setParameter` database command.

  .. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

  Maps the username provided to {{program}} for authentication to a LDAP
  Distinguished Name (DN). You may need to use {{role}} to transform a
  username into an LDAP DN in the following scenarios:
    
  - Performing LDAP authentication with simple LDAP binding, where users
    authenticate to MongoDB with usernames that are not full LDAP DNs.
  
  - Using an :option:`LDAP authorization query template
    <--ldapAuthzQueryTemplate>` that requires a DN.
    
  - Transforming the usernames of clients authenticating to Mongo DB using
    different authentication mechanisms (e.g. x.509, kerberos) to a full LDAP
    DN for authorization.
  
  {{role}} expects a quote-enclosed JSON-string representing an ordered array
  of documents. Each document contains a regular expression ``match`` and
  either a ``substitution`` or ``ldapQuery`` template used for transforming the
  incoming username.
  
  Each document in the array has the following form:
    
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     {
       match: "<regex>"
       substitution: "<LDAP DN>" | ldapQuery: "<LDAP Query>"
     }

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 70 20

     * - Field
       - Description
       - Example
       
     * - ``match``
       - An ECMAScript-formatted regular expression (regex) to match against a 
         provided username. Each parenthesis-enclosed section represents a 
         regex capture group used by ``substitution`` or ``ldapQuery``.
       - ``"(.+)ENGINEERING"``
         ``"(.+)DBA"``
       
     * - ``substitution``
     
       - An LDAP distinguished name (DN) formatting template that converts the
         authentication name matched by the ``match`` regex into a LDAP DN.
         Each curly bracket-enclosed numeric value is replaced by the
         corresponding `regex capture group
         <http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html>`_ extracted
         from the authentication username via the ``match`` regex.
         
       - ``"cn={0},ou=engineering,
         dc=example,dc=com"``
       
     * - ``ldapQuery``
     
       - A LDAP query formatting template that inserts the authentication
         name matched by the ``match`` regex into an LDAP query URI encoded
         respecting RFC4515 and RFC4516. Each curly bracket-enclosed numeric
         value is replaced by the corresponding `regex capture group
         <http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html>`_ extracted
         from the authentication username via the ``match`` expression. 
         {{program}} executes the query against the LDAP server to retrieve
         the LDAP DN for the authenticated user. {{program}} requires
         exactly one returned result for the transformation to be
         successful, or {{program}} skips this transformation.
         
       - ``"ou=engineering,dc=example,
         dc=com??one?(user={0})"``

  For each document in the array, you must use either ``substitution`` or
  ``ldapQuery``. You *cannot* specify both in the same document.

  When performing authentication or authorization, {{program}} steps through
  each document in the array in the given order, checking the authentication
  username against the ``match`` filter.  If a match is found,
  {{program}} applies the transformation and uses the output for 
  authenticating the user. {{program}} does not check the remaining documents
  in the array.
  
  If the given document does not match the provided authentication name, or
  the transformation described by the document fails, {{program}} continues
  through the list of documents to find additional matches. If no matches are
  found in any document, {{program}} returns an error.

  .. example::

    The following shows two transformation documents. The first
    document matches against any string ending in ``@ENGINEERING``, placing
    anything preceeding the suffix into a regex capture group. The
    second document matches against any string ending in ``@DBA``, placing
    anything preceeding the suffix into a regex capture group.
  
    .. important::  You must pass the array to {{role}} as a string.
  
    .. code-block:: text
    
       "[
          {
             match: "(.+)@ENGINEERING.EXAMPLE.COM",
             substitution: "cn={0},ou=engineering,dc=example,dc=com"
          },
          {
             match: "(.+)@DBA.EXAMPLE.COM",
             ldapQuery: "ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com??one?(user={0})"
                  
          }
        
       ]"
  
    A user with username ``alice@ENGINEERING.EXAMPLE.COM`` matches the first
    document. The regex capture group ``{0}`` corresponds to the string
    ``alice``. The resulting output is the DN
    ``"cn=alice,ou=engineering,dc=example,dc=com"``.
  
    A user with username ``bob@DBA.EXAMPLE.COM`` matches the second document.
    The regex capture group ``{0}`` corresponds to the string ``bob``.  The
    resulting output is the LDAP query
    ``"ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com??one?(user=bob)"``. {{program}} executes this
    query against the LDAP server, returning the result
    ``"cn=bob,ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com"``.

  If {{role}} is unset, {{program}} applies no transformations to the username
  when attempting to authenticate or authorize a user against the LDAP server.

  This setting can be configured on a running {{program}} using the 
  :dbcommand:`setParameter` database command.

  For each LDAP DN returned by the query, {{program}} assigns the authorized
  user a corresponding role on the ``admin`` database. If a role on the on the
  ``admin`` database exactly matches the DN, {{program}} grants the user the
  roles and privileges assigned to that role. See the
  :method:`db.createRole()` method for more information on creating roles.
