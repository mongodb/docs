"Virtual private networks, or VPNs, make it possible to link two networks "
"over an encrypted and limited-access trusted network. Typically, MongoDB "
"users who use VPNs use TLS/SSL rather than IPSEC VPNs for performance "
"issues."

"Depending on configuration and implementation, VPNs provide for "
"certificate validation and a choice of encryption protocols, which "
"requires a rigorous level of authentication and identification of all "
"clients. Furthermore, because VPNs provide a secure tunnel, by using a "
"VPN connection to control access to your MongoDB instance, you can "
"prevent tampering and \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks."
