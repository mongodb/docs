   :class: twocols

Before you install |onprem|, you must deploy its supporting databases.
These are called :term:`backing databases`. These databases include the
:ref:`mms-application-database` and the
:term:`backup database <Backup Database>`. The following table
compares the |onprem| Application Database and the Backup Database:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 30 30
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Database
     - Application Database
     - :term:`Backup Database`

   * - What does the database store?
     - |onprem| operational data
     - :term:`Oplog <oplog>` data, temporary sync data, and, depending
       on your configuration, your :term:`snapshots <snapshot>`

   * - Is the database necessary?
     - Yes
     - No, unless you use |onprem| to
       :doc:`backup </core/backup-overview>` the databases that
       |onprem| manages.

   * - How should the database store the data?
     - Dedicated :term:`replica set` on independent storage volume
     - Dedicated :term:`replica set` per backup database on independent
       storage volumes

   * - Can the database use more than one deployment?
     - No
     - :doc:`Yes </tutorial/configure-backup-high-availability>`

   * - Can |onprem| manage the database?
     - No
     - Yes

.. note::

   Each backing database must use a dedicated replica set. *The replica
   set can't store other data*.

   Running regular backups, a backup database could fill a volume. If
   the application database cannot write to a volume, |onprem| stops.
   Proper storage setup reduces the risk of |onprem| failures.

Considerations
--------------

Replica Set Topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each :term:`backing database <backing databases>` :term:`replica set`
should include three data-bearing members for high availability. If you
lack storage capacity for three data-bearing members, the third member
of a backing database may be an :term:`arbiter`.

For the |onprem| :term:`application database`, you may run one member
of the replica set on the same host as |onprem|.

.. admonition:: Backing Databases with fewer than three data-bearing members
   :class: important

   When writing to its :term:`backing databases`, |onprem| uses the
   :guilabel:`Replica Acknowledged` (``w:2``)
   :manual:`write concern </reference/write-concern>`. This write
   concern reports a write as successful *only* after the primary *and*
   one secondary acknowledge that write. This means that if a backing
   database loses one of the two data-bearing members, MongoDB stops
   write operations.

.. _consider-monitoring-appdb:

Application Database Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose to monitor the application database after you install
|onprem|.

To monitor your application database:

1. Finish installing the backing databases.
#. Install |application|.
#. :setting:`Enable Monitoring <Application Database Monitoring>` for
   the application database.

   a. :doc:`Install the {+mdbagent+} </tutorial/install-mongodb-agent-to-monitor>`
      on the application database hosts.
   b. :doc:`Add the application database </tutorial/enable-appdb-monitoring>`
      through the |onprem| UI.

.. seealso::

   To follow the full procedure, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/enable-appdb-monitoring`.

.. _requirements-backing-db-replica-sets:

Prerequisites
-------------

Replica Set Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`replica sets <replica set>` that host the |onprem|
:term:`backing databases` must:

Use Dedicated Databases
  The :term:`replica sets <replica set>` must store data to support
  |onprem| metadata *only*. They must store *no other data*.

Use a Compatible MongoDB Version
  .. include:: /includes/fact-compatible-mongodb-versions.rst

Use the WiredTiger Storage Engine for the Application Database
  Use :manual:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>` for the |onprem|
  application database.

Use the WiredTiger Storage Engine for the Backup Database
  For backup database configuration options, see
  :doc:`Backup Preparations </core/backup-preparations>`.

Use Queries that Do Not Require Indexes
  Do *not* run the :term:`backing databases` with the MongoDB
  :parameter:`--notablescan` parameter set. When set, this parameter
  specifies that all queries must use indexes.

.. _backing-instances-security:

Replica Set Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Secure the Connection to the :term:`Backing Databases <backing databases>`
  Ensure that connections from |onprem| to your
  :term:`backing databases` are secure. Configure these databases to
  accept connections from |onprem| that
  :ref:`only use TLS <configure-ssl-backing>`.

Configure an :term:`Authentication Mechanism <authentication mechanism>` for the :term:`Backing Databases <backing databases>`
  Limit access to your backing databases to specific MongoDB users
  using an authentication mechanism. To configure your backing
  databases to use authentication, see :ref:`configure-auth-backing`.

Configure the |mms| User that Accesses the :term:`Backing Databases <backing databases>` with Only Needed Roles
  Set these users to have the :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase` and
  :authrole:`dbAdminAnyDatabase` roles. If a backing database is a
  sharded cluster, add :authrole:`clusterAdmin`, otherwise add
  :authrole:`clusterMonitor`.

.. _backing-instances-prerequisites:

Host Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The hosts that run the :term:`replica sets <replica set>` must meet the
following requirements for:

Hardware
  The hosts must meet :ref:`mms-application-database-specifications` or
  :ref:`backup-database-specifications` depending on which database
  the host runs. If a host serves other |onprem| components in
  addition to the database, you must sum the hardware requirements for
  each component to determine the requirements for the host.

System Configuration
  The hosts must be configured according to the requirements given in
  the :manual:`MongoDB Production Notes </administration/production-notes>`
  except where explicitly contradicted in this tutorial. The Production
  Notes include information on ulimits, NUMA, and other configuration
  options.

Networking
  Host network security must allow the needed ports described in
  :doc:`/reference/firewall-configuration`. The appropriate inbound
  and outbound firewall rules for each host must allow
  access to the required ports.

|rhel| and CentOS 6 hosts only
  .. include:: /includes/rhel-ulimit-conf-file.rst

|rhel| and CentOS hosts running SELinux in ``enforcing`` mode
  If the hosts are not configured to use the default MongoDB
  :option:`data <mongod.--dbpath>` or :option:`log <mongod.--logpath>`
  paths or :manual:`ports </reference/default-mongodb-port>` and are
  enforcing SELinux policies, update the SELinux policies before
  starting the :term:`backing databases`.

  To learn how to update the SELinux policy:

  - For MongoDB Community edition, see
    :ref:`Configure SELinux <install-rhel-configure-selinux>`

  - For MongoDB Enterprise edition, see
    :ref:`Configure SELinux <install-enterprise-rhel-configure-selinux>`

Deploy Backing Databases
------------------------

To deploy MongoDB :term:`replica sets <replica set>` to host the
|onprem| :term:`backing databases`:

.. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-backing-dbs.rst

Next Steps
----------

- When you install |onprem|, you must set the :setting:`mongo.mongoUri`
  setting to connect to the :term:`replica set` you created for the
  application database in this tutorial.

- If you enable backup for your |onprem| deployment, you must
  :doc:`configure the oplog store </tutorial/manage-oplog-storage>` to
  use the replica set that you created for the backup database in this
  tutorial. If you *also* choose to use a :term:`blockstore` or
  :term:`S3 snapshot store <S3 Snapshot Store>` to store your
  :term:`snapshots <snapshot>`, you must
  :manual:`deploy one Replica Set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>` for
  each :doc:`blockstore </tutorial/manage-blockstore-storage>` or
  :doc:`S3 blockstore </tutorial/manage-s3-blockstore-storage>`
  metadata database.
