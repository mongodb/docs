You must create a MongoDB user to access your cluster. For security
purposes, |service| requires clients to authenticate as MongoDB users
to access clusters.

MongoDB users are separate from |service| users:

- MongoDB users can access databases hosted in |service|.

- |service| users can log into |service| but do not have access to
  MongoDB databases.

Procedure
---------

To add a MongoDB user to your cluster:

   cluster, see :doc:`/security-add-mongodb-users/`.

:doc:`Connect to Your Cluster </tutorial/connect-to-your-cluster>`.
