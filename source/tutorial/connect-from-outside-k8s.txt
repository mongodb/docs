The following procedure describes how to connect to a MongoDB resource
deployed by |k8s| from outside of the |k8s| cluster.

.. important::
   You can only connect to a :doc:`standalone
   </tutorial/deploy-standalone>` or a :doc:`sharded cluster
   </tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster>` resource from outside of the
   |k8s| cluster.

Prerequisite
------------

For your databases to be accessed outside of |k8s|, they must run one
of the following versions of MongoDB:

- 3.6.17 or later
- 4.0.15 or later
- 4.2.3 or later
- 4.4.0 or later

Procedure
---------

How you connect to a MongoDB resource that |k8s| deployed from outside
of the |k8s| cluster depends on the resource.

- For standalone or sharded cluster deployments, set the resource's
  :setting:`spec.exposedExternally` flag to ``true``.

  When this flag is set to ``true``, the |k8s-op-short| creates a
  :k8sdocs:`NodePort service </concepts/services-networking/service/>`.
  The NodePort service exposes the deployment as a network service,
  thereby enabling access from outside of the |k8s| cluster.

- For replica sets, set the resource's:

  - :setting:`spec.security.tls.enabled` to ``true``.
  - :setting:`spec.security.tls.additionalCertificateDomains` to the
    collection of one or more domains for the other horizons that this
    replica set uses.
  - :setting:`spec.connectivity.replicaSetHorizons` to the collection
    of horizons and |uri|\s of the replica set.

Example Deployment Configurations
---------------------------------

.. tabs-deployments::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: standalone

      In the following example, set ``spec.exposedExternally`` to
      ``true`` in the standlone configuration object. This
      exposes the deployment outside of the |k8s| cluster:

      .. literalinclude:: /reference/k8s/example-exposed-standalone.yaml
         :language: yaml
         :emphasize-lines: 15

      Once your standalone instance is deployed in |com|, run the
      following command to get information on the NodePort service
      created by the Operator:

      .. code-block:: sh

         kubectl get services -n <namespace>

      The list output by this command should contain an entry
      similar to the following:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         NAME                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE

         standalone-svc-external   NodePort    10.102.27.116   <none>        27017:30994/TCP   8m30s

      In this case, the |mongod| is exposed on port ``27017`` in the
      |k8s| container, and the NodePort service exposes the ``mongod``
      via port ``30994``.

      When you connect to your deployment, you must specify the
      external |dns| of a node in the |k8s| cluster as the ``--host``
      option in your ``mongo`` command. If a node in the |k8s| cluster
      has an external |dns| of
      ``ec2-54-212-23-143.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com``, you can
      connect to this standalone instance from outside of |k8s| using
      the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo --host ec2-54-212-23-143.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com --port 30994

      .. include:: /includes/admonitions/fact-get-external-dns.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: repl

      In the following example, set the highlighted parameter and value pairs in the replica set configuration object. This
      exposes the deployment outside of the |k8s| cluster:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/yaml-files/example-replica-set.yaml
         :language: yaml
         :start-after: START-horizon-addcert-replset-upper
         :end-before: END-horizon-addcert-replset-upper
         :linenos:
         :lineno-start: 1
         :copyable: false

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/yaml-files/example-replica-set.yaml
         :language: yaml
         :start-after: START-horizon-addcert-replset-lower
         :end-before: END-horizon-addcert-replset-lower
         :linenos:
         :lineno-start: 15
         :emphasize-lines: 1-14

   .. tab::
      :tabid: shard

      In the following example, set ``spec.exposedExternally`` to
      ``true`` in the sharded cluster configuration object. This
      exposes the deployment outside of the |k8s| cluster:

      .. literalinclude:: /reference/k8s/example-exposed-sharded.yaml
         :language: yaml
         :emphasize-lines: 19

      Once your sharded cluster is deployed in |com|, run the
      following command to get information on the NodePort service
      created by the Operator:

      .. code-block:: sh

         kubectl get services -n <namespace>

      The list output by this command should contain an entry
      similar to the following:

      .. code-block:: sh
         :copyable: false

         NAME                          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE

         shardedcluster-svc-external   NodePort    10.106.44.30    <none>        27017:30078/TCP   10s

      In this case, the |mongos| is exposed on port
      ``27017`` in the |k8s| container, and the NodePort service
      exposes the ``mongos`` via port ``30078``.

      When you connect to your deployment, you must specify the
      external |dns| of a node in the |k8s| cluster as the ``--host``
      option in your |mongo| command. If a node in the |k8s| cluster
      has an external |dns| of
      ``ec2-54-212-23-143.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com``, you can
      connect to this standalone instance from outside of |k8s| using
      the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo --host ec2-54-212-23-143.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com --port 30078
