To delete your |service| account, you must ensure that you have no:

- Outstanding invoices
- Active {+database-deployments+}
- Projects  
- Organizations

This document walks you through deleting your 
|service| account.

.. important::

   If you log in to |service| through an identity provider, you can't 
   delete your account yourself. Contact your identity provider 
   to delete your |service| account.

Delete All Projects
-------------------

Delete a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prerequisites
`````````````

To delete a project for an organization:

- You must either have the ``Owner`` role for the project or have 
  the ``Organization Owner`` role for the project's organization.

- The project must have no outstanding invoices.

- The project must have no active {+database-deployments+}.

Check Project Invoices
``````````````````````

To learn how to view your project's invoices, see
:ref:`atlas-invoices`.

Terminate All Clusters
``````````````````````

.. warning::

   Terminating a cluster also deletes any backup snapshots for that
   cluster. See :ref:`retention-policy`.

To terminate an |service| {+cluster+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps/terminate-atlas-cluster.rst

To terminate an |service| {+serverless-instance+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps/terminate-atlas-serverless-instance.rst

|service| executes the terminate operation after completing any
in-progress deployment changes.

Delete the Project
``````````````````

You can delete a project for an organization either from the
organization's :guilabel:`Projects` view or the project's
:guilabel:`Project Setting` view:

.. tabs::

   tabs:

   - id: projects-view

     name: "Delete from Projects view"

     content: |
       .. include:: /includes/steps/delete-project.rst

   - id: project-setting-view

     name: "Delete from Project Setting view"

     content: |
       .. include:: /includes/steps/delete-project-from-settings.rst

Leave or Delete All Organizations
---------------------------------

Leave an Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   If you are the only :authrole:`Organization Owner` in an 
   organization, you must promote 
   another member to :authrole:`Organization Owner` before you can 
   leave an organization.

.. include:: /includes/steps/leave-organization.rst

Delete an Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   To delete an organization, you must have the
   :authrole:`Organization Owner` role for the organization.

   You cannot delete an organization that has active projects. You must
   delete the organization's projects before you can delete the
   organization.

.. include:: /includes/steps/delete-organization.rst

Once you delete all active {+database-deployments+}, projects, and 
organizations, you are no longer billed for any |service| activity 
and no longer receive |service| alerts.

Delete your |service| Account
-----------------------------

.. important::

   Once you delete your account there's no way to recover it.
   
   You can't reuse the email address that is associated with the 
   deleted account to create a new |service| account.

.. include:: /includes/steps/delete-atlas-account.rst
