Modeling application data for MongoDB depends on both the data itself,
as well as the characteristics of MongoDB itself. For example,
different data models may allow applications to use more efficient
queries, increase the throughput of insert and update operations, or
distribute activity to a sharded cluster more effectively.

These factors are *operational* or address requirements that arise
outside of the application but impact the performance of MongoDB based
applications. When developing a data model, analyze all of your
application's :doc:`read operations </core/read-operations>` and
:doc:`write operations </core/write-operations>` in conjunction with
the following considerations.

.. _data-model-document-growth:

Document Growth
---------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

Some updates to documents can increase the size of documents. These
updates include pushing elements to an array (i.e. :update:`$push`) and
adding new fields to a document.

When using the MMAPv1 storage engine, document growth can be a
consideration for your data model. For MMAPv1, if the document size
exceeds the allocated space for that document, MongoDB will relocate
the document on disk. With MongoDB 3.0.0, however, the default use of
the :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` minimizes the occurrences of such
re-allocations as well as allows for the effective reuse of the freed
record space.

When using MMAPv1, if your applications require updates that will
frequently cause document growth to exceeds the current power of 2
allocation, you may want to refactor your data model to use references
between data in distinct documents rather than a denormalized data
model.

You may also use a *pre-allocation* strategy to explicitly avoid
document growth. Refer to the :ecosystem:`Pre-Aggregated Reports Use
Case </use-cases/pre-aggregated-reports>` for an example of the
*pre-allocation* approach to handling document growth.

See :doc:`/core/mmapv1` for more information on MMAPv1.

.. _data-model-atomicity:
.. _data-modeling-atomicity:

Atomicity
---------

In MongoDB, operations are atomic at the :term:`document` level. No
**single** write operation can change more than one document.
Operations that modify more than a single document in a collection
still operate on one document at a time. [#record-atomicity]_ Ensure
that your application stores all fields with atomic dependency
requirements in the same document. If the application can tolerate
non-atomic updates for two pieces of data, you can store these data in
separate documents.

A data model that embeds related data in a single document
facilitates these kinds of atomic operations. For data models that
store references between related pieces of data, the application must
issue separate read and write operations to retrieve and modify these
related pieces of data.

See :ref:`data-modeling-atomic-operation` for an example data model
that provides atomic updates for a single document.

.. [#record-atomicity] Document-level atomic operations include all
   operations within a single MongoDB document record: operations that
   affect multiple embedded documents within that single record are still
   atomic.

Sharding
--------

MongoDB uses :term:`sharding` to provide horizontal scaling. These
clusters support deployments with large data sets and high-throughput
operations. Sharding allows users to :term:`partition` a
:term:`collection` within a database to distribute the collection's
documents across a number of :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances or
:term:`shards <shard>`.

To distribute data and application traffic in a sharded collection,
MongoDB uses the :ref:`shard key <shard-key>`. Selecting the proper
:ref:`shard key <shard-key>` has significant implications for
performance, and can enable or prevent query isolation and increased
write capacity. It is important to consider carefully the field or
fields to use as the shard key.

See :doc:`/core/sharding-introduction` and
:doc:`/core/sharding-shard-key` for more information.

.. _data-model-indexes:

Indexes
-------

Use indexes to improve performance for common queries. Build indexes on
fields that appear often in queries and for all operations that return
sorted results. MongoDB automatically creates a unique index on the
``_id`` field.

As you create indexes, consider the following behaviors of indexes:

- Each index requires at least 8KB of data space.

- Adding an index has some negative performance impact for write
  operations. For collections with high write-to-read ratio, indexes
  are expensive since each insert must also update any indexes.

- Collections with high read-to-write ratio often benefit from
  additional indexes. Indexes do not affect un-indexed read operations.

- When active, each index consumes disk space and memory. This usage
  can be significant and should be tracked for capacity planning,
  especially for concerns over working set size.

See :doc:`/applications/indexes` for more information on indexes as
well as :doc:`/tutorial/analyze-query-plan/`. Additionally, the MongoDB
:doc:`database profiler </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>` may
help identify inefficient queries.

.. _data-model-large-number-of-collections:

Large Number of Collections
---------------------------

In certain situations, you might choose to store related information in
several collections rather than in a single collection.

Consider a sample collection ``logs`` that stores log documents for
various environment and applications. The ``logs`` collection contains
documents of the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { log: "dev", ts: ..., info: ... }
   { log: "debug", ts: ..., info: ...}

If the total number of documents is low, you may group documents into
collection by type. For logs, consider maintaining distinct log
collections, such as ``logs_dev`` and ``logs_debug``. The ``logs_dev``
collection would contain only the documents related to the dev
environment.

Generally, having a large number of collections has no significant
performance penalty and results in very good performance. Distinct
collections are very important for high-throughput batch processing.

When using models that have a large number of collections, consider
the following behaviors:

- Each collection has a certain minimum overhead of a few kilobytes.

- Each index, including the index on ``_id``, requires at least 8KB of
  data space.

- For each :term:`database`, a single namespace file (i.e.
  ``<database>.ns``) stores all meta-data for that database, and each
  index and collection has its own entry in the namespace file. MongoDB
  places :limit:`limits on the size of namespace files
  <Size of Namespace File>`.

- MongoDB using the ``mmapv1`` storage engine has :limit:`limits on
  the number of namespaces <Number of Namespaces>`. You may wish to
  know the current number of namespaces in order to determine how many
  additional namespaces the database can support. To get the current
  number of namespaces, run the following in the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
  shell:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.system.namespaces.count()

  The limit on the number of namespaces depend on the ``<database>.ns``
  size. The namespace file defaults to 16 MB.

  To change the size of the *new* namespace file, start the server with
  the option :option:`--nssize \<new size MB\> <mongod --nssize>`. For
  existing databases, after starting up the server with
  :option:`--nssize <mongod --nssize>`, run the :method:`db.repairDatabase()` command
  from the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. For impacts and considerations on
  running :method:`db.repairDatabase()`, see
  :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`.

Data Lifecycle Management
-------------------------

Data modeling decisions should take data lifecycle management into
consideration.

The :doc:`Time to Live or TTL feature </tutorial/expire-data>` of
collections expires documents after a period of time. Consider using
the TTL feature if your application requires some data to persist in
the database for a limited period of time.

Additionally, if your application only uses recently inserted
documents, consider :doc:`/core/capped-collections`. Capped collections
provide *first-in-first-out* (FIFO) management of inserted documents
and efficiently support operations that insert and read documents based
on insertion order.
