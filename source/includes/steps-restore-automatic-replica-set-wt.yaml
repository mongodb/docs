  a. Choose the point from which you want to restore your backup.

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 40 40
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Restore Type

          - Description

          - Action

        * - :guilabel:`Snapshot`

          - Allows you to choose one
            :term:`stored snapshot <snapshot>`.

          - Select an existing :term:`snapshot <snapshot>` to restore.

        * - :guilabel:`Point In Time`

          - Creates a custom snapshot that includes all operations up
            to but not including the selected time. By default, the
            Oplog Store stores 24 hours of data.

            .. example::

               If you select ``12:00``, the last operation in the
               restore is ``11:59:59`` or earlier.

            .. important::

               You cannot perform a :abbr:`PIT (Point in Time)` restore
               that covers any time prior to the latest backup resync.
               For the conditions that cause a resync, see
               :doc:`/tutorial/resync-backup`.

          - Select a :guilabel:`Date` and :guilabel:`Time`.

        * - :guilabel:`Oplog Timestamp`

          - Creates a custom snapshot that includes all operations up
            to and including the entered Oplog timestamp. The Oplog
            Timestamp is represented as two fields:

            .. list-table::
               :widths: 20 80

               * - :guilabel:`Timestamp`
                 - |epoch-time|

               * - :guilabel:`Increment`
                 - Order of operation applied in that second as a
                   32-bit ordinal.

          - Type an Oplog :guilabel:`Timestamp` and
            :guilabel:`Increment`.

            Run a query against :data:`local.oplog.rs` on your
            :term:`replica set` to find the desired timestamp.

  b. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

  a. Click :guilabel:`Choose Cluster to Restore to`.

  b. Complete the following fields:

     .. list-table::

        :header-rows: 1

        * - Field
          - Action

        * - :guilabel:`Project`
          - Select a :term:`project` to which you want to restore the
            :term:`snapshot`.

        * - :guilabel:`Cluster to Restore to`
          - Select a :term:`cluster` to which you want to restore
            the snapshot.

            |mms| *must* manage the target replica set.

            .. warning::
               Automation removes all existing data from the
               cluster. All backup data and snapshots for the
               existing cluster are preserved.

  b. Click :guilabel:`Restore`.

     |mms| notes how much storage space the restore requires.
