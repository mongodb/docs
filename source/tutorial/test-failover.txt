Replica set elections are necessary every time |service| makes
configuration changes as well as during failure scenarios.
Configuration changes may occur as a result of patch updates or scaling
events. As a result, you should write your applications to be capable
of handling elections without any downtime.

.. include:: /includes/fact-retry-writes.rst

You can use the |service| UI and API to test the failure of the
replica set :term:`primary` in your |service| cluster and observe how your 
application handles a replica set failover. 

.. _test-failover-process:

Test Failover Process 
---------------------

When you submit a request to test failover using the |service| UI 
or |api|, |service| simulates a failover event. During this 
process:

a. |service| shuts down the current :term:`primary`.

#. The members of the replica set hold an election to choose which
   of the secondaries will become the new primary.

#. |service| brings the original primary back to the
   :term:`replica set` as a :term:`secondary`. When the old primary
   rejoins the replica set, it will sync with the new primary to
   catch up any writes that occurred during its downtime.

   .. note::
      If the original primary accepted write operations that had not
      been successfully replicated to the secondaries when the
      primary stepped down, the primary rolls back those write
      operations when it re-joins the replica set and begins
      synchronizing. For more information on rollbacks, see
      `Rollbacks During Replica Set Failover 
      <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-rollbacks/>`_.

   Contact MongoDB support for assistance with resolving rollbacks.

.. note::

   If you are testing failover on a sharded cluster, |service| triggers 
   an election on all the replica sets in the sharded cluster.
   
   - Only the :binary:`~bin.mongos` processes that are on the same 
     instances as the primaries of the replica sets in the sharded cluster 
     are restarted. 
   - The primaries of the replica sets in the sharded cluster are restarted 
     in parallel.

Test Failover Using the |service| UI 
------------------------------------

Log in to the |service| UI and do the following:

1. Click :guilabel:`Clusters`.

#. For the cluster you wish to perform failover testing, click on the
   :guilabel:`...` button.

#. Click :guilabel:`Test Failover`. |service| displays a 
   :guilabel:`Test Failover` modal with the steps |service| will take to 
   simulate a failover event. 

#. Click :guilabel:`Restart Primary` to begin the test. See 
   :ref:`Test Failover Process <test-failover-process>` for information 
   on the failover process. |service| notifies you in the 
   :guilabel:`Test Failover` modal the results of your failover process.

Test Failover Using the API 
---------------------------

You can use the :ref:`Test Failover <test-failover-api>` |api| endpoint 
to simulate a failover event. To learn more about the failover process,  
see :ref:`Test Failover Process <test-failover-process>`.

You can verify that the failover was successful by doing the following:

1. Log in to the |service| UI and click :guilabel:`Clusters`.

#. Click the name of the cluster for which you performed the failover 
   test.

#. Observe the following changes in the list of nodes in 
   the :guilabel:`Overview` tab:

   - The original ``PRIMARY`` node is now a ``SECONDARY`` node.

   - A former ``SECONDARY`` node is now the ``PRIMARY`` node.

Troubleshoot Failover Issues 
----------------------------

If your application does not handle the failover gracefully, ensure the
following:

- The connection string includes all members of the replica set.
- You are using the latest version of the driver.
- You have implemented appropriate retry logic in your application.
