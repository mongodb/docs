- The :pipeline:`$match` stage that includes a ``$text`` must be
  the **first** stage in the pipeline.

- A ``$text`` operator can only occur once in the stage.

- The ``$text`` operator expression cannot appear in
  :expression:`$or` or :expression:`$not` expressions.

- ``$text``, by default, does not return the matching documents in order
  of matching scores. To sort by descending score, use the
  :expression:`$meta` aggregation expression in the :pipeline:`$sort` stage.
