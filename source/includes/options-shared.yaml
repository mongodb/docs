  .. versionadded:: 2.4

  Specifies the database that holds the user's (e.g :option:`--username
  <{{role}} --username>`) credentials.

  .. build system replaces this with
     /includes/fact-authentication-source-mongo on the mongo shell
     man page.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-authentication-source-tool.rst

  See :doc:`/core/access-control` for more information on authentication
  in MongoDB.
  
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: authenticationMechanism
directive: option
args: <name>
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.4

  Specifies the authentication mechanism. By default, the authentication
  mechanism is ``MONGODB-CR``, which is the MongoDB challenge/response
  authentication mechanism. In |ent-build|, {{role}} also includes
  support for ``GSSAPI`` to handle Kerberos authentication.

  See :doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication`
  for more information about Kerberos authentication.
optional: true

program: _shared
name: db
aliases: -d
directive: option
args:  <db>
description: |
  Specifies the name of the database on which to run {{role}}.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: dbpath
directive: option
args: <path>
description: |
  Specifies the directory of the MongoDB data files. If used, the
  ``--dbpath`` option enables {{role}} to attach directly to local data
  files without a running :program:`mongod`. When run with ``--dbpath``,
  {{role}} locks access to the data directory. No :program:`mongod` can
  access the same path while the process runs.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: help
aliases: -h
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Returns the options and usage information.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: host
aliases: -h
directive: option
args: <hostname><:port>
description: |
  Specifies a resolvable hostname for the :program:`mongod` to which to
  connect. By default {{role}} attempts to connect to a MongoDB instance
  running on the localhost on port number ``27017``.

  To connect to a replica set, specify the replica set seed name and the
  seed list of set members. Use the following format:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     <replica_set_name>/<hostname1><:port>,<hostname2:<port>,...

  You can always connect directly to a single MongoDB instance by
  specifying the host and port number directly.
optional: false
---
program: _shared
name: ipv6
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Enables IPv6 support. Allows {{role}} to connect to the MongoDB
  instance using an IPv6 network. By default, MongoDB programs and
  processes disable IPv6 support.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: journal
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Allows {{role}} operations to use the durability :term:`journal` to
  ensure data files remain valid and recoverable. This option is only
  relevant when specifying the :option:`--dbpath` option.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: password
aliases: -p
directive: option
args: <password>
description: |
  Specifies a password to authenticate to a MongoDB database that requires
  authentication. Use in conjunction with the ``--username`` and
  ``--authenticationDatabase`` options.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: port
directive: option
args: <port>
description: |
  Specifies the port number when the MongoDB instance is not running on the
  standard port of ``27017``. You may also specify the port number
  using the ``--host`` option.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: ssl
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  Enables connection to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` that has
  SSL support enabled.

  The `default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: sslAllowInvalidCertificates
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  Bypasses the validation checks for server certificates and allows
  the use of invalid certificates. When using the
  :setting:`sslAllowInvalidCertificates` setting, MongoDB logs as a
  warning the use of the invalid certificate.

  The `default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: sslCAFile
directive: option
args: <filename>
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains the root certificate chain
  from the Certificate Authority. Specify the file name of the
  :file:`.pem` file using relative or absolute paths.

  The `default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: sslCRLFile
directive: option
args: <filename>
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains the Certificate Revocation
  List. Specify the file name of the :file:`.pem` file using relative or
  absolute paths.

  The `default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: sslFIPSMode
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  Uses the FIPS mode of the installed OpenSSL library. Your system must
  have a FIPS compliant OpenSSL library to use :option:`--sslFIPSMode`.

  The `default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: sslPEMKeyFile
directive: option
args: <filename>
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  Specifies the :file:`.pem` file that contains both the SSL certificate
  and key. Specify the file name of the :file:`.pem` file using relative
  or absolute paths.

  This option is required when using the :option:`--ssl` option to connect
  to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` that has
  :setting:`sslCAFile` enabled *without*
  :setting:`sslWeakCertificateValidation`.

  The `default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: sslPEMKeyPassword
directive: option
args: <value>
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.5.4

  Specifies the password to de-crypt the certificate-key file (i.e.
  :option:`--sslPEMKeyFile`). Only use :option:`--sslPEMKeyPassword` if
  the certificate-key file is encrypted. In all cases, {{role}} will
  redact the password from all logging and reporting output.

  If the private key in the PEM file is encrypted and you do not specify
  :option:`--sslPEMKeyPassword`, {{role}} will prompt for a passphrase.
  See :ref:`ssl-certificate-password`.

  The `default distribution of MongoDB does not contain support for SSL.
  For more information on MongoDB and SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: username
aliases: -u
directive: option
args: <username>
description: |
  Specifies a username to authenticate to a MongoDB database that requires
  authentication. Use in conjunction with the ``--password`` and
  ``--authenticationDatabase`` options. If you specify a username without
  a password, {{role}} prompts for a password interactively.
optional: true
---
program: _shared
name: verbose
aliases: -v
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Increases the amount of internal reporting returned on standard output
  or in log files. Increase the verbosity with the ``-v`` form by
  including the option multiple times, (e.g. ``-vvvvv``.)
