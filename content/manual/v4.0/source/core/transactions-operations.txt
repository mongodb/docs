For transactions:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-crud.rst

Operations that affect the database catalog, such as creating or
dropping a collection or an index, are not allowed in multi-document
transactions. For example, a multi-document transaction cannot include
an insert operation that would result in the creation of a new
collection. See :ref:`transactions-operations-ref-restricted`.

Operations Supported in Multi-Document Transactions

CRUD Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following read/write operations are allowed in transactions:

.. include:: /includes/table-transactions-operations.rst

.. _transactions-operations-count:

Count Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a count operation within a transaction, use the
:pipeline:`$count` aggregation stage or the :pipeline:`$group` (with a
:group:`$sum` expression) aggregation stage.

MongoDB drivers compatible with the 4.0 features provide a
collection-level API ``countDocuments(filter, options)`` as a helper
method that uses the :pipeline:`$group` with a :group:`$sum` expression
to perform a count. The 4.0 drivers have deprecated the ``count()`` API.

Starting in MongoDB 4.0.3, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the
:method:`db.collection.countDocuments()` helper method that uses the
:pipeline:`$group` with a :group:`$sum` expression to perform a count.
