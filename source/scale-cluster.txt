Considerations
--------------

Migration, Availability, and Performance Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The time required for an :term:`initial sync` and resynchronizing data
across storage volumes increases linearly with the amount of data in
the cluster. Making changes to a cluster often requires migrating to new
servers and storage volumes. The time required for an initial sync and
resynchronizing data across storage volumes increases linearly with the
amount of data in the cluster.

Tier migrations which require an :term:`initial sync`:

- Upgrades from a free or shared tier (``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` clusters)
  to a higher tier.

- Changes to :ref:`NVMe storage volumes <nvme-storage>`. NVMe clusters
  auto-scale to the next higher tier when 90% of the available storage space
  is consumed, and the migration requires an initial sync.

To maximize availability:

- For a replica set, |service| migrates one node at a time, starting
  with the secondary nodes first and then the primary.

- For a sharded cluster, |service| performs the migration of the shards
  independently of each other. For each shard (i.e. replica set),
  |service| migrates one node at a time, starting with the secondary
  nodes first and then the primary.

:manual:`Retryable writes </core/retryable-writes>` should prevent any
write errors during the election of a new primary. On average, an
election can take five seconds.

Migration can affect performance if your primary is already reaching
operational capacity: each newly migrated replica set node must
perform an :term:`initial sync` from the primary, adding to the
operational load. Migrations can also affect performance if
:manual:`read preferences </core/read-preference>` are set to read from
secondaries: the replica set is down one secondary during the
migration.

.. include:: /includes/fact-auto-index.rst

.. Note to writers: beginning in v20160712, a cluster tier change
.. with no disk change does not require an initial sync

Billing
~~~~~~~

As you modify your cluster, you can compare the costs of different
options before applying them. The :guilabel:`Cluster Overview` box
displays the cost of the selected configuration, excluding data
transfer.

.. admonition:: Free Tier
   :class: important

   Upgrading an ``M0`` Free Tier cluster to an ``M2`` or greater paid
   tier cluster starts billing for the cluster. See :doc:`billing` for
   complete documentation on |service| billing.

The following sections provide complete documentation for each of the
|service| cluster scaling configuration options.

Backup
~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-continuous-backup-transition.rst

.. warning::

   |service| deletes {+Old-Backup+}s snapshots when you:

   - Change from {+Old-Backup+}s to {+Cloud-Backup+}s and
     remain on the same MongoDB version.

   - Change from {+Old-Backup+}s to {+Cloud-Backup+}s and
     perform a major MongoDB version upgrade other than 4.0 to 4.2.
     For example, if you change from {+Old-Backup+}s to {+Cloud-Backup+}s while upgrading from 3.6 to 4.0, |service|
     deletes {+old-backup+}s.

.. _scale-cluster-open-dialog:

Open the :guilabel:`Editing Cluster` Dialog
-------------------------------------------

For the cluster you want to modify, click the ellipses :guilabel:`...`
icon, then select :guilabel:`Edit Configuration`.

Alternatively, if you are already viewing the specific cluster,
click the :guilabel:`Configuration` button.

For ``M0`` Free Tier clusters, you can also click the
:guilabel:`Upgrade` button for the cluster.

.. _scale-cluster-global-config:

Modify the :guilabel:`Global Cluster Configuration`
---------------------------------------------------

.. important::

   You can't disable |global-write| for a cluster once deployed.

You can enable global writes for your cluster or modify
existing global cluster configurations.

To learn more about global clusters, see
:ref:`global-clusters`.

To learn how to configure global clusters and map your global cluster
zones, see :ref:`create-new-global-write-cluster`.

.. _scale-cluster-region:
.. _scale-cluster-cloud-provider:

Modify the :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region`
----------------------------------------------

.. admonition:: Considerations
   :class: note

   - .. include:: /includes/fact-modify-cloud-provider.rst

   - .. include:: /includes/fact-modify-cloud-provider-live-migrate.rst

Select :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region` to view the
currently configured cloud provider and region for the cluster.

Select the desired cloud provider and region for your cluster.

If you are upgrading from an |service| ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5``
shared-tier cluster, you can change the cloud provider backing your
cluster by selecting from the available cloud providers.

For details on cloud providers and regions for both single-region
and multi-region clusters,
see :ref:`create-cluster-cloud-provider-region`.

For more information on moving a cluster to a new region, see
:ref:`move-cluster`.

.. _scale-cluster-storage:
.. _scale-cluster-instance:

Modify the :guilabel:`Cluster Tier`
-----------------------------------

You can change the cluster tier, as well as the memory, storage,
and |iops| (speed) specifications for the selected cluster.

.. admonition:: Free and Shared-Tier Cluster Considerations
   :class: note

   - You can't downgrade an ``M10+`` cluster to an
     ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5`` Shared-Tier Starter instance size.

   - Changing the cluster tier from an ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5``
     Shared-Tier cluster to an ``M10`` or larger cluster tier requires
     downtime.

Select your preferred cluster tier. The selected instance
size dictates the  memory, storage, and IOPS specification for each
data-bearing server [#data-bearing]_ in the cluster.


For more information on cluster tiers, see
:ref:`create-cluster-instance`.

From the :guilabel:`Cluster Tier` section, you can also:

- :ref:`create-cluster-storage`

- :ref:`Configure Autoscaling Options <scale-cluster-autoscale>`

Modify :guilabel:`Additional Settings`
--------------------------------------

From the :guilabel:`Additional Settings` section, you can

- :ref:`scale-cluster-version`,
- :ref:`scale-cluster-backups`,
- :ref:`scale-cluster-sharding`,
- :ref:`scale-cluster-shardNum`,
- :ref:`scale-cluster-enable-bi`,
