  a. Paste the following example services into a text editor:

     .. literalinclude:: /reference/k8s/example-openshift-service.yaml
        :linenos:
        :lineno-start: 1
        :emphasize-lines: 12-13, 26-27, 40-41 
  
     .. note::
         
        If the ``spec.selector`` has entries that target headless 
        services or applications, OpenShift may create a software 
        firewall rule explicitly dropping connectivity. Review the 
        selectors carefully and consider targeting the stateful set pod 
        members directly as seen in the example. Routes in OpenShift 
        offer port 80 or port 443. This example service uses 
        port 443.

  #. Change the settings to your preferred values.

  #. Save this file with a ``.yaml`` file extension.

  #. To create the services, invoke the following ``kubectl`` command 
     on the services file you created:

     .. code-block:: sh

        kubectl apply -f <my-external-services>.yaml

        To ensure the |tls| |sni| negotiation with |mongod| necessary
        for |mongod| to respond with the correct horizon replica set 
        topology for the drivers to use, you must set |tls| 
        termination passthrough.

  The |k8s-op-short| should deploy the MongoDB replica set, 
  configured with the horizon routes created for ingress. After 
  the |k8s-op-short| completes the deployment, you may connect with the 
  horizon using |tls| connectivity.  If the certificate authority is 
  not present on your workstation, you can view and copy it from a 
  MongoDB pod using the following command:

  .. code-block:: sh  
  
     oc exec -it my-external-0 -- cat /mongodb-automation/ca.pem

  To test the connections, run the following command:

  .. note::
     
     In the following example, for each member of the replica set, use
     your replica set names and replace ``{redacted}`` with the domain
     that you manage.

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongosh --host my-external/my-external-0.{redacted} \
           --port 443
           --ssl \
           --tlsAllowInvalidCertificates

  .. warning::

     Don't use the ``--tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` flag in production.
     
  In production, for each host in a replica set, specify the |tls|
  certificate and the |certauth| to securely connect to client tools or
  applications:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongosh --host my-external/my-external-0.{redacted} \
       --port 443 \
       --tls \
       --tlsCertificateKeyFile server.pem \
       --tlsCAFile ca-pem

  If the connection succeeds, you should see:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     Enterprise <my-replica-set> [primary]

...
