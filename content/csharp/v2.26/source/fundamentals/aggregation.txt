Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-long+} to perform
**aggregation operations**.

Aggregation operations process data in your MongoDB collections and
return computed results. The MongoDB Aggregation framework is modeled on the 
concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a pipeline comprised of one or
more stages, and this pipeline transforms the documents into an aggregated result.

Analogy
~~~~~~~

Aggregation operations function similarly to car factories with assembly
lines. The assembly lines have stations with specialized tools to
perform specific tasks. For example, when building a car, the assembly
line begins with the frame. Then, as the car frame moves through the
assembly line, each station assembles a separate part. The result is a
transformed final product, the finished car.

The assembly line represents the *aggregation pipeline*, the individual
stations represent the *aggregation stages*, the specialized tools
represent the *expression operators*, and the finished product
represents the *aggregated result*.

Compare Aggregation and Find Operations
---------------------------------------

The following table lists the different tasks you can perform with find
operations, compared to what you can achieve with aggregation
operations. The aggregation framework provides expanded functionality
that allows you to transform and manipulate your data.

   * - Find Operations
     - Aggregation Operations

   * - | Select *certain* documents to return
       | Select *which* fields to return
       | Sort the results
       | Limit the results
       | Count the results
     - | Select *certain* documents to return
       | Select *which* fields to return
       | Sort the results
       | Limit the results
       | Count the results
       | Group the results
       | Rename fields
       | Compute new fields
       | Summarize data
       | Connect and merge data sets

Server Limitations
------------------

Consider the following :manual:`limitations </core/aggregation-pipeline-limits/>` when 
performing aggregation operations:

- Returned documents must not violate the :manual:`BSON document size limit </reference/limits/#mongodb-limit-BSON-Document-Size>`
  of 16 megabytes.

- Pipeline stages have a memory limit of 100 megabytes by default. If required, you can exceed this limit by setting
  the `AllowDiskUse <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.AggregateOptions.AllowDiskUse.html#MongoDB_Driver_AggregateOptions_AllowDiskUse>`__
  property of the ``AggregateOptions`` object that you pass to the ``Aggregate()`` method.

- The :manual:`$graphLookup </reference/operator/aggregation/graphLookup/>` stage has
  a strict memory limit of 100 megabytes and ignores the ``AllowDiskUse`` property.

Aggregation Example
-------------------

To perform an aggregation, pass a list of aggregation stages to the
``IMongoCollection<TDocument>.Aggregate()`` method.

.. note::
  
  This example uses the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
  from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
  free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see :ref:`csharp-quickstart`.

The following code example produces a count of the number of bakeries in each borough
of New York City. To do so, it uses an aggregation pipeline that contains the following stages:

- A :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage to filter for documents whose
  ``cuisine`` field contains the value ``"Bakery"``.

- A :manual:`$group </reference/operator/aggregation/group/>` stage to group the matching
  documents by the ``borough`` field, accumulating a count of documents for each distinct value
  of that field.

The following sections implement this example by using LINQ, Builders, and BsonDocument
approaches to create and combine the aggregation stages used in the example pipeline.

LINQ Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/LinqAggregation.cs
      :language: csharp
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin-aggregation
      :end-before: end-aggregation
   
   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      { _id = Bronx, Count = 71 }
      { _id = Brooklyn, Count = 173 }
      { _id = Staten Island, Count = 20 }
      { _id = Missing, Count = 2 }
      { _id = Manhattan, Count = 221 }
      { _id = Queens, Count = 204 }

To learn more about using LINQ to construct aggregation pipelines, see the
:ref:`csharp-linq` guide.      

Builders Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/BuilderAggregation.cs
      :language: csharp
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin-aggregation
      :end-before: end-aggregation
   
   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      { _id = Bronx, Count = 71 }
      { _id = Brooklyn, Count = 173 }
      { _id = Staten Island, Count = 20 }
      { _id = Missing, Count = 2 }
      { _id = Manhattan, Count = 221 }
      { _id = Queens, Count = 204 }

To learn more about using builders to construct aggregation pipelines,
see the :ref:`csharp-builders-aggregation` section of the Operations with Builders guide.       

BsonDocument Approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Aggregation.cs
      :language: csharp
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin-aggregation
      :end-before: end-aggregation

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      { "_id" : "Brooklyn", "count" : 173 }
      { "_id" : "Manhattan", "count" : 221 }
      { "_id" : "Bronx", "count" : 71 }
      { "_id" : "Missing", "count" : 2 }
      { "_id" : "Staten Island", "count" : 20 }
      { "_id" : "Queens", "count" : 204 }
