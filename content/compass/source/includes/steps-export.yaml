  You can select either :guilabel:`JSON` or :guilabel:`CSV`. If you select

  and select from the following extended JSON formats: 
  
  .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 50, 50

         * - JSON Format
           - Description

         * - Default Extended JSON
           - A string format that avoids any loss of BSON type information. This 
             is the default |compass-short| setting.  

         * - Relaxed Extended JSON
           - A string format that emphasizes readability and interoperability at 
             the expense of type preservation. That is, conversion from relaxed 
             format to BSON can lose type information.

             :red:`WARNING:` This format is not recommended for data integrity. 

         * - Canonical Extended JSON
           - A string format that emphasizes type preservation at the expense of 
             readability and interoperability. That is, conversion from canonical 
             to BSON will generally preserve type information except in certain 
             specific cases.
