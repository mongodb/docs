In addition to the authentication mechanisms offered in MongoDB
Community, MongoDB Enterprise provides integration with the following
external authentication mechanisms.

.. _security-auth-kerberos:

Kerberos Authentication
-----------------------

`MongoDB Enterprise <http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?jmp=docs>`_
supports authentication using a Kerberos service. Kerberos is an industry
standard authentication protocol for large client/server systems.

To use MongoDB with Kerberos, you must have a properly configured
Kerberos deployment, configured :ref:`Kerberos service principals
<kerberos-service-principal>` for MongoDB, and added :ref:`Kerberos
user principal <kerberos-user-principal>` to MongoDB.

For more information on Kerberos and MongoDB, see:

- :doc:`/core/kerberos`,

- :doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication` and

- :doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-windows-with-kerberos-authentication`.

.. _security-auth-ldap:

LDAP Proxy Authentication
-------------------------

`MongoDB Enterprise
<http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?jmp=docs>`_ supports
proxy authentication through a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) service.

.. versionchanged:: 3.4

   MongoDB 3.4 supports using operating system libraries instead of the
   `saslauthd <http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/saslauthd8.html>`_
   daemon, allowing MongoDB 3.4 servers running on Linux and Microsoft Windows
   to connect to LDAP servers. Linux MongoDB deployments continue to support
   ``saslauthd``.

Previous versions of MongoDB support authentication against an LDAP server
using simple and SASL binding via ``saslauthd``. This restricted LDAP
authentication support to only Linux MongoDB deployments.

See :doc:`/core/security-ldap` for more information.

LDAP Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.4

MongoDB Enterprise supports querying an LDAP server for the LDAP groups the
authenticated user is a member of. MongoDB maps the Distinguished Names (DN)
of each returned group to :ref:`roles <roles>` on the ``admin`` database.
MongoDB authorizes the user based on the mapped roles and their associated
privileges. See :ref:`LDAP Authorization <security-ldap-external>` for more
information.
