You can visualize your |service| billing data in |charts| by 
creating a billing dashboard. Billing dashboards are 
:ref:`dashboards <dashboards>` with prebuilt charts that 
help you monitor your |service| usage. After you ingest your
billing data, you can add a billing dashboard and customize 
it to suit your specific billing needs.

To learn more about how |service| bills your deployments, 
see :atlas:`Manage Billing </billing>`.

Billing Dashboards
------------------

Billing dashboards provide metrics and detailed charts about the 
usage in your organization across different categories 
and periods of time. The insights from your dashboard 
can help you optimize your |service| spending.

By default, billing dashboards include the following metrics 
and charts:

- Total spending across your organization
- Biggest spenders in your organization
- Total spending by instance size, project, cluster, product category, or SKU
- Total cost by product category

Required Access
---------------

To create a billing dashboard, you must have at least 
:authrole:`Project Data Access Read/Write` permissions.

Limitations
-----------

At any given time, billing dashboards use 
the last twelve months of your organization's billing data.

If you change an existing invoice, |service| updates the
billing data in your ingestion only if you've incurred 
the invoice within the last three months. Any invoice changes
reflect in your dashboard after the next scheduled ingestion.

Create a Billing Dashboard
--------------------------

To ingest your billing data and add a billing dashboard:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: In the left navigation menu, click :guilabel:`Ingestions`.
      
   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Atlas Billing` card, click :guilabel:`Add configuration`.

      The :guilabel:`New Configuration` dialog box displays.

         :figwidth: 500px
         :alt: Configuration box for the Atlas Billing Ingestion.

   .. step:: Configure the |service| Billing Ingestion.

      a. Enter your :guilabel:`Organization public API key` and :guilabel:`Organization private API key`.
      
         Your key pair must have at least :authrole:`Organization Billing Admin`
         and :authrole:`Organization Billing Viewer` access.
         
         To learn how to create and view an API key for your organization,
         see :atlas:`Grant Programmatic Access to Atlas 
         </configure-api-access/#grant-programmatic-access-to-service>`.

      #. From the dropdown, select the :guilabel:`Target deployment` to 
         store your billing data.
      #. (Optional) Change the :guilabel:`Database name`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Save`.

      |charts-short| uses the :oas-atlas-tag:`Invoices API </Invoices>`
      to ingest the last twelve months of your organization's billing 
      data into the specified deployment and database. After you create
      the initial ingestion, |service| ingests billing data daily.

   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Atlas Billing` card, click :guilabel:`Add and Open`.
   
      |charts-short| generates the billing dashboard and saves it to 
      the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page. All dashboard and chart
      features, such as :ref:`dashboard filters <filter-dashboards>` 
      and :ref:`interactive filtering <interact-with-charts>`, apply to
      billing dashboards and its prebuilt charts.

      To learn more about filtering billing dashboards, 
      see :ref:`billing-dashboard-filter`.

.. _billing-dashboard-filter:

Apply Dashboard Filters
-----------------------

You can use :ref:`dashboard filters <filter-dashboards>`
to refine the charts across your billing dashboard.
By default, billing dashboards include
filters on the following fields from your billing data:

- ``name``
- ``cluster``
- ``category``
- ``sku`` 

To view active filters, click the filter icon 
in the top-right corner of your dashboard to expand 
the :guilabel:`Dashboard Filters` pane. 

In the :guilabel:`Dashboard Filters` pane, 
you can manage your active filters
or click :guilabel:`Edit` to add and apply 
new filters. When you apply a filter, the 
charts in your dashboard update to display only data 
that matches the field values that you filtered on.

To learn more, see :ref:`dashboard-filters-pane`.

Example
~~~~~~~

Consider a sample billing dashboard that uses the following filters:

- A filter on the ``category`` field to include only invoices 
  related to the |charts-short| and Private Endpoint categories.

- A filter on the ``date`` field to include only invoices incurred 
  within the past 6 months.

Once the filters are applied, the charts in the billing dashboard 
highlight only the values specified in these filters. For example:

.. figure:: /images/charts/billing-dashboard-filter-example.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: A sample Billing Dashboard with filters on the category 
         and date fields.
