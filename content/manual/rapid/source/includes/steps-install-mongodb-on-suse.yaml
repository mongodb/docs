      To install the latest version of MongoDB, issue the following
      command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo zypper -n install {+package-name-org+}
  - pre: |
      To install a specific release of MongoDB, specify each
      component package individually and append the version number to the
      package name, as in the following example:

      .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-suse.rst
  - pre: |
      You can specify any available version of MongoDB. However ``zypper``
      upgrades the packages when a newer version becomes available. To
      prevent unintended upgrades, pin the packages by running the following
      command:

      .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-suse-lock.rst
post: |
  Previous versions of MongoDB packages use a different repository location.
  Refer to the version of the documentation appropriate for
  your MongoDB version.
