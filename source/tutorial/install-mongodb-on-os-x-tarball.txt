Overview
--------

The following tutorial downloads the ``.tgz`` file directly to install
MongoDB Community Edition on macOS. To install using ``brew``, see
:doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x` instead.

Prerequisites
-------------

MongoDB 4.2+ only supports macOS versions 10.12 and
later on Intel x86-64. See :ref:`mongodb-supported-platforms` for more
information.

Install MongoDB Community Edition
---------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/install-past-mongodb-org-osx.rst

.. note::

   You can also spin up MongoDB on AWS, Azure, or GCP using Atlas, our
   fully-managed database-as-a-service. Atlas enables you to configure anything
   from a free sandbox environment to a globally sharded production cluster.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Security
~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB binaries, :binary:`mongod
<bin.mongod>` and :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`, bind to
``localhost`` by default.

When bound only to the localhost, these binaries can only accept
connections from clients that are running on the same machine. Remote
clients cannot connect to the binaries bound only to localhost. For
more information, including how to override and bind to other ip
addresses, see :ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`.
