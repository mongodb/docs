Command Limitations in Paid Tier Clusters
=========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

|service| requires clients to authenticate to access an |service| 
cluster. |service| provides a curated list of 
:ref:`MongoDB Database User Privileges <atlas-user-privileges>`. 
These privileges provide access to a subset of MongoDB commands. 

The following list covers the most common commands that 
|service| MongoDB user privileges do not support. The 
functionality provided by these commands are largely subsumed by 
|service|, or are restricted to ensure cluster stability and
performance.
