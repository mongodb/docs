.. note:: **Availability**
   |mms| can display real-time metrics for MongoDB deployments that
   Automation manages. Collection of real time data requires the 
   {+mdbagent+}.
   
   |mms| supports real-time metrics for |mongod| (replica sets and
   shards) and |mongos| processes.

To view real-time metrics, click the :guilabel:`Metrics` button
for the desired deployment, then click :guilabel:`Real Time`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-cluster-metrics.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/admonition-pii-user-role.rst

In the upper-right corner, you can click to view the metrics in a 
:guilabel:`Table` or :guilabel:`Graph`.

       has reported.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-sys-mem-by-os-rtpp.rst

   * - :guilabel:`Operations`

     - Number of operations as reported by
       :manual:`mongostat </reference/program/mongostat/#fields>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Query Execution Times`

     - Displays latency metrics for current read requests,
       write requests, and other database commands. Available
       only for MongoDB 3.4+. To learn more, see ``opLatencies``
       at :manual:`serverStatus </reference/command/serverStatus>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Query Targeting`

     - Ratio of documents and objects scanned to
       documents and objects returned in current queries. These
       metrics are useful in determining if and how a query
       uses an index. To learn more, see
       :manual:`Analyze Query Performance 
       </tutorial/analyze-query-plan>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Reads & Writes`

     - Number of active reads, queued reads, active
       writes, and queued writes as reported by
       :manual:`mongostat </reference/program/mongostat/#fields>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Replication Lag`

     - Time required to replicate operations from
       the primary to the secondary members of a replica set.
       Available only for secondary members of a replica set.
       To learn more, see
       :manual:`Replica Set Secondary Members 
       </core/replica-set-secondary>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Hottest Collections`

     - Collections with the most operations that
       :manual:`mongotop </reference/program/mongotop/#fields>`
       has reported. For each hot collection, the table also
       displays the :guilabel:`Utilization Percent` for the
       collection.

       :guilabel:`Utilization Percent` is calculated from the 
       read and write times that 
       :manual:`mongotop </reference/program/mongostat/#fields>`
       has reported during a sample period. Specifically, the
       :guilabel:`Utilization Percent` is the percentage
       (rounded to the nearest 0.1%) of the read and write
       times for a collection relative to the read and write
       times for all collections in the deployment during the
       sample period. If no read and write operation occur
       during this period, the :guilabel:`Utilization Percent`
       may be 0%.

       The hottest collections correspond to the most current
       time displayed in the charts. That is, if the display is
       running (not paused), the collections correspond to
       the hottest collections at the current timestamp. If the
       display is paused, the collections correspond to the
       hottest collections at the paused time.

   * - :guilabel:`Slowest Operations`

     - Slowest operations that the
       :manual:`db.currentOp() </reference/method/db.currentOp>`
       has reported.

       The operations correspond to the most current time
       displayed in the charts. That is, if the display is
       running (not paused), the operations correspond to
       the slowest operations at the current timestamp. If the
       display is paused, the operations correspond to the
       slowest operations at the paused time.

       Click the operation to view the detailed JSON
       document that 
       :manual:`db.currentOp() </reference/method/db.currentOp>`
       has reported for the operation.

       Users with the
       :ref:`Data Access Admin <data-access-admin-role>`
       role can access buttons to force stop an operation or
       an inactive transaction in the operation details panel:

       To stop a slow operation:

       #. Click the operation in the :guilabel:`Slowest Operations` 
          pane.

       #. Click :guilabel:`Kill Op` in the 
          :guilabel:`Operation Details` pane.

          Alternatively, click :guilabel:`Kill Session` if the
          operation is  an inactive transaction.

       #. Click :guilabel:`Yes, terminate this operation` in the
          :guilabel:`Confirm Operation` modal.

       To learn more about
       :manual:`transactions </core/transactions>`, refer to
       the MongoDB manual.

To hide/show a metric in the graph, click the color box for
the metric.

Read Exact Metrics from Graph View
----------------------------------

If you pause the :guilabel:`Graph` view of the Real-Time
Performance Panel, you can hover over a line graph to see its
exact value, along with the slowest operations and hottest
collections, at a given moment in time.

Stop and Restart Display
------------------------

To stop the update of the metrics displayed, click
:guilabel:`Pause`. :guilabel:`Pause` only
stops the update of the displays and doesn't pause the
collection of the underlying data.

To restart the display updates, click :guilabel:`Play`.
