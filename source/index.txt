This package adds functionalities to the Eloquent model and Query builder for
MongoDB, using the original Laravel API.
*This library extends the original Laravel classes, so it uses exactly the
same methods.*

This package was renamed to ``mongodb/laravel-mongodb`` because of a transfer
of ownership to MongoDB, Inc. It is compatible with Laravel 10.x. For older
versions of Laravel, please see the `old versions <https://github.com/mongodb/laravel-mongodb/tree/3.9#laravel-version-compatibility>`__.
