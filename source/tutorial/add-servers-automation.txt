|mms| can automate operations for the MongoDB processes running on your
servers. |mms| can both discover existing processes and deploy new ones.

Procedure
---------

Install the {+aagent+} on each server that you want |mms| to
manage. The following procedure applies to all operating systems. For
instructions for a specific operating system, see
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent`.

On Linux servers, if you installed MongoDB with a package manager, use the
same package manager to install the {+aagent+}. If you installed
MongoDB without a package manager, use an archive to install the
{+aagent+}.

Once you have installed the agent to all your servers, you can deploy your
first :doc:`replica set </tutorial/deploy-replica-set>`, :doc:`cluster
</tutorial/deploy-sharded-cluster>`, or :doc:`standalone
</tutorial/deploy-standalone>`.
