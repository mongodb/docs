Overview

This tutorial describes how to upgrade an existing
:ref:`mms-application-package` and :ref:`Backup Daemon <backup-daemon>`

an earlier version, you must first upgrade to version 1.5.

You must have administrative access on the machines on which you perform
the upgrade.

You must have the download link available on the customer downloads page
provided to you by MongoDB. If you do not have this link, you can access

Procedures

The version of your existing |onprem| installation determines your upgrade
path. The following table lists upgrade paths per version:

.. include:: /includes/list-table-upgrade-path-per-verion.rst

There are no supported downgrade paths for |onprem|.

To upgrade a tarball installation, backup the configuration file and logs,
and then re-install the |onprem| server.

.. important:: It is crucial that you back up the existing
   configuration because the upgrade process will delete existing
   data.
