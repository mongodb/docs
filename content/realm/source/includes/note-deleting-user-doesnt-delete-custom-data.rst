   Deleting a user only deletes the user object, which may contain associated 
   :ref:`metadata <ios-user-metadata>`. This does not delete :ref:`custom 
   user data <ios-custom-user-data>` or user-entered data from your 
   application. Apple :apple:`requires that you disclose data retention 
   and deletion policies <app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1>` to your 
   application customers and give them a way to request user data deletion.
   If you collect additional user data, you must implement your own methods 
   or processes to delete that data.
