and see its compatibility with {+qe+}.

MongoDB Edition, Topology, and Version Compatibility
----------------------------------------------------

{+qe+} with automatic encryption is only available with MongoDB Enterprise
Edition and MongoDB Atlas. You can use {+qe+} on a
MongoDB replica set or sharded cluster, but not a standalone instance.

:ref:`Explicit encryption <qe-fundamentals-manual-encryption>` is
available with MongoDB Community and Enterprise Edition.
