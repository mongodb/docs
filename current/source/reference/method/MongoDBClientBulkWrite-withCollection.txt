Definition
----------

.. phpmethod:: MongoDB\ClientBulkWrite::withCollection()

   Return an updated instance of :phpclass:`MongoDB\ClientBulkWrite`
   from the provided :phpclass:`MongoDB\Collection` instance. This
   method allows you to add subsequent write operations on a different
   collection than that with which the ``ClientBulkWrite`` was created.

   This method does not build a new :php:`BulkWriteCommand
   <mongodb-driver-bulkwritecommand>` and does not edit the
   ``ClientBulkWrite`` instance in place.

   .. code-block:: php

      function withCollection(
          Collection $collection,
      ): self

   You cannot mix ``Collection`` instances associated with different
   ``Manager`` objects when calling this method on a ``ClientBulkWrite``
   instance. This is because the library sends the completed
   ``BulkWriteCommand`` to a single server.

Parameters
----------

``$collection`` : :phpclass:`MongoDB\Collection`
  The ``Collection`` instance to set as the target for write operations
  added to the ``ClientBulkWrite`` instance after calling
  ``withCollection()``.

Return Values
-------------

A new ``ClientBulkWrite`` instance with the same ``BulkWriteCommand``
specification but an updated target namespace.
