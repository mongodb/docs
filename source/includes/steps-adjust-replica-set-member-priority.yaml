action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    cfg.members[0].priority = 0.5
    cfg.members[1].priority = 2
    cfg.members[2].priority = 2
post: |
  This sequence of operations modifies the value of ``cfg`` to set the
  priority for the first three members defined in the
  :data:`~local.system.replset.members` array.
