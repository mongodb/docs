|service| provides details to connect to a cluster via the
:program:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell or a MongoDB driver.

.. _connection-limits:

Connection Limits and Instance Sizes
------------------------------------

|service| sets the :setting:`limits for concurrent incoming connections
<net.maxIncomingConnections>` based on instance size:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Instance Size
     - Maximum Number of Concurrent Incoming Connections
   
   * - ``M10``
     - 350

   * - ``M20``
     - 700

   * - ``M30``
     - 2000

   * - ``M40``
     - 4000

   * - ``M50``
     - 6000

   * - ``M60``
     - 8000

   * - ``M100``
     - 16000

Prerequisites
-------------

- TLS/SSL
   Clients must have support for TLS/SSL to connect to an |service|
   cluster.

   If using the :program:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell, you must use **version 3.2.6 or
   later** binary with TLS/SSL support. If you do not have a 3.2.6 or
   later :program:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell with TLS/SSL support, you can download
   the latest 3.2 version of the :program:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell from the
   :guilabel:`Connect` dialog.

   You can also download the Server package, which includes the
   :program:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell from the `Download Center
   <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center>`_. If downloading the
   version 3.2.6 Server package for OSX, do not use homebrew to install
   the the package for use with |service|; instead, download the
   ``*.tgz`` or ``*.zip`` file.

- Whitelist
   To access a cluster, you must connect from an IP address on the
   |service| group's IP whitelist. If you need to add an IP address to the
   whitelist, you can do so in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog. You can
   also add the IP address from the :ref:`Security tab <add-to-whitelist>`.

Connect to Your Cluster
-----------------------

To view connection specification details for a cluster, go to the
:guilabel:`Clusters` view.
