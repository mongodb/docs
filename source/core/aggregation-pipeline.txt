Aggregation Pipeline
====================

.. versionadded:: 2.2

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation modeled
on the concept of data processing pipelines. Documents enter a
multi-stage pipeline that transforms the documents into an aggregated
results.

The aggregation pipeline provides an alternative to :term:`map-reduce`
and may be the preferred solution for many aggregation tasks where the
complexity of map-reduce may be unwarranted.

Aggregation pipeline have some limitations on value types and result
size. See :doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline-limits` for details on
limits and restrictions on the aggregation pipeline.

.. _aggregation-pipeline:

Pipeline
--------

Conceptually, documents from a collection travel through an
aggregation pipeline, which transforms these objects as they pass
through. For those familiar with UNIX-like shells (e.g. bash), the
concept is analogous to the pipe (i.e. ``|``).

The MongoDB aggregation pipeline starts with the documents of a
collection and streams the documents from one :ref:`pipeline operator
<aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>` to the next to process the
documents. Each operator in the pipeline transforms the documents as they
pass through the pipeline. Pipeline operators do not need to produce
one output document for every input document. Operators may generate
new documents or filter out documents. Pipeline operators can be
repeated in the pipeline.

.. include:: /includes/fact-agg-helper-returns-cursor.rst

See :ref:`aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference` for the list of
pipeline operators that define the stages.

For example usage of the aggregation pipeline, consider
:doc:`/tutorial/aggregation-with-user-preference-data` and
:doc:`/tutorial/aggregation-zip-code-data-set`, as well as the
:dbcommand:`aggregate` command and the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method reference pages.

.. _aggregation-expressions:

Pipeline Expressions
--------------------

Each pipeline operator takes a pipeline expression as its operand.
Pipeline expressions specify the transformation to apply to the input
documents. Expressions have a :term:`document` structure and can
contain fields, values, and :ref:`operators
<aggregation-expression-operators>`.

Pipeline expressions can only operate on the current document in the
pipeline and cannot refer to data from other documents: expression
operations provide in-memory transformation of documents.

Generally, expressions are stateless and are only evaluated when seen
by the aggregation process with one exception: :term:`accumulator`
expressions. The accumulator expressions, used with the
:pipeline:`$group` pipeline operator, maintain their state (e.g.
totals, maximums, minimums, and related data) as documents progress
through the pipeline.

For the expression operators, see
:ref:`aggregation-expression-operators`.

.. _aggregation-optimize-performance:

Aggregation Pipeline Behavior
-----------------------------

In MongoDB, the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command operates on a single
collection, logically passing the *entire* collection into the
aggregation pipeline. To optimize the operation, wherever possible, use
the following strategies to avoid scanning the entire collection.

.. _aggregation-pipeline-operators-and-performance:

Pipeline Operators and Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$match` and :pipeline:`$sort` pipeline operators can
take advantage of an index when they occur at the **beginning** of the
pipeline.

.. versionadded:: 2.4
   The :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline operator takes advantage of a
   geospatial index. When using :pipeline:`$geoNear`, the
   :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline operation must appear as the first
   stage in an aggregation pipeline.

Even when the pipeline uses an index, aggregation still requires access
to the actual documents; i.e. indexes cannot fully cover an aggregation
pipeline.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6
   In previous versions, for very select use cases, an index could
   cover a pipeline.

Early Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your aggregation operation requires only a subset of the data in a
collection, use the :pipeline:`$match`, :pipeline:`$limit`, and
:pipeline:`$skip` stages to restrict the documents that enter at the
beginning of the pipeline. When placed at the beginning of a pipeline,
:pipeline:`$match` operations use suitable indexes to scan only
the matching documents in a collection.

Placing a :pipeline:`$match` pipeline stage followed by a
:pipeline:`$sort` stage at the start of the pipeline is logically
equivalent to a single query with a sort and can use an index. When
possible, place :pipeline:`$match` operators at the beginning of the
pipeline.

Additional Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aggregation pipeline has an internal optimization phase that
provides improved performance for certain sequences of operators. For
details, see :ref:`aggregation-pipeline-sequence-optimization`.

The aggregation pipeline supports operations on sharded collections.
See :ref:`aggregation-pipeline-sharded-collection`.
