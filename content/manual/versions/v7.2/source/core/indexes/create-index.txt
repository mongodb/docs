Indexes support efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. If your
application is repeatedly running queries on the same fields, you can
create an index on those fields to improve performance for those
queries.

To create an index, use the :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` shell
method or equivalent method for your driver. This page shows examples
for the MongoDB Shell and drivers.

About this Task
---------------

When you run a create index command in the MongoDB Shell or a driver,
MongoDB only creates the index if an index of the same specification
does not exist.

Although indexes improve query performance, adding an index has negative
performance impact for write operations. For collections with a high
write-to-read ratio, indexes are expensive because each insert and
update must also update any indexes.

Example

.. include:: /includes/driver-examples/driver-example-indexes-1.rst

.. note:: Index Sort Order

   .. include:: /includes/indexes/fact-single-field-index-sort.rst

Results
-------

To confirm that the index was created, use :binary:`mongosh` to run the
:method:`db.collection.getIndexes` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.getIndexes()

Output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
     { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' },
     { v: 2, key: { name: -1 }, name: 'name_-1' }
   ]

To view information on created indexes using a driver, refer to your
:driver:`driver's documentation </>`.
