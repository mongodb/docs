  Use the :doc:`automationConfig </reference/api/automation-config>`
  resource to retrieve the configuration. Issue the following command,
  replacing ``<user@example.net>`` with the credentials of the
  :ref:`global owner <global-owner-role>`, ``<api_key>`` with the
  previously retrieved API key, ``<app-example.net>`` with the URL of
  |mms|, and ``<group_id>`` with the previously retrieved group ID:

  code: |
    curl -u "<user@example.net>:<api_key>" "http://<app-example.net>/api/public/v1.0/groups/<group_id>/automationConfig" --digest -i
post: |
  Confirm that the ``version`` field of the retrieved :ref:`automation
  configuration <automation-configuration-sample-entity>` matches the
  ``version`` field in the ``mms-cluster-config-backup.json`` file.

  Create a document with the following fields. As you build the
  configuration document, refer the
  :ref:`description of an automation configuration
  <automation-configuration-sample-entity>` for detailed explanations
  of the settings.

title: "Add MongoDB versions to the configuration document."
stepnum: 3
ref: add-mongodb-versions
pre: |
  In the ``mongoDbVersions`` array, add the versions of MongoDB to have
  available to the deployment. Add only those versions you will use. The
  following array includes just one version, ``2.4.12``, but you can specify multiple
  versions.

title: "Add the Monitoring Agent to the configuration document."
stepnum: 4
ref: add-monitoring-agent
pre: |
  In the ``monitoringVersions.hostname`` field, enter the hostname of the
  server where |mms| should install the Monitoring Agent. Use the fully
  qualified domain name that running ``hostname -f`` on the
  server returns, as in the following:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    "monitoringVersions": [
        {

                "timeThresholdHrs": 24
            }

post: |
  This configuration example also includes the ``logPath`` field, which
  specifies the log location, and ``logRotate``, which specifies the log
  thresholds.

title: Add the servers to the configuration document.
stepnum: 5
ref: add-servers
pre: |
  This sharded cluster has 10 MongoDB instances, as
  described in the :ref:`create-cluster-with-api-overview`, each running
  on its own server. Thus, the automation configuration's ``processes`` array will have 10
  documents, one for each MongoDB instance.

  The following example adds the first document to the ``processes``
  array. Replace ``<process_name_1>`` with any name you choose, and
  replace ``<server_1.example.net>`` with the FQDN of the server. You
  will need to add 9 documents: one for each MongoDB instance in your
  sharded cluster.

  The example uses the ``args2_4`` syntax for the ``processes.<args>``
  field. For MongoDB versions 2.6 and later, use the ``args2_6`` syntax.
  See :doc:`/reference/api/automation-config` for information on the two forms.

stepnum: 6
ref: add-topology
action:

      Add two replica set documents to the ``replicaSets`` array. Add
      three members to each document. The following example shows one
      replica set member added in the first replica set document:

          },
          ...
  - pre: |
      In the ``sharding`` array, add the replica sets to the shards, and
      add the three config servers, as in the following:

                      "rs": "rs2"

title: Send the configuration document.
stepnum: 7
ref: send-configuration-doc
pre: |
  Use the ``groups/<group_id>/automationConfig`` endpoint to
  to send the automation configuration document to |mms|, as in 
  the following. Replace
  ``<user@example.net>`` with the credentials of the :ref:`global owner
  <global-owner-role>`, ``<api_key>`` with previously retrieved API key,
  ``<app-example.net>`` with the |mms| URL, and
  ``<group_id>`` with the previously retrieved group ``id``.

  Replace ``<configuration_document>`` with the configuration document
  you have created in the previous steps.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    curl -u "<user@example.net>:<api_key>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://<app-example.net>/api/public/v1.0/groups/<group_id>/automationConfig" --digest -i -X PUT --data '
    <configuration_document>
    '
post: |
  Upon successful update of the configuration, the API returns the
  ``HTTP/1.1 200 OK`` status code to indicate the request has succeeded.
---
title: Confirm successful update of the automation configuration.
stepnum: 8
ref: confirm-update-of-configuration-doc
pre: |
  Retrieve the automation configuration
  to compare it against the document you sent. In particular, confirm that
  the ``version`` field equals ``2``.

  Issue a command similar to the following. Replace the credentials, API
  key, ``<app-example.net>`` URL, and group ``id`` as in previous steps.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    curl -u "<user@example.net>:<api_key>" "http://<app-example.net>/api/public/v1.0/groups/<group_id>/automationConfig" --digest -i
---
title: Check the deployment status to ensure goal state is reached.
stepnum: 9
ref: check-deployment-status
action:
  - pre: |
      Use the :doc:`automationStatus </reference/api/automation-status>`
      resource to retrieve the deployment status. Issue the following
      command, replacing the credentials, API key, URL, and
      group ``id`` as in previous steps.
    language: sh
    code: |
      curl -u "<user@example.net>:<api_key>" "http://<app-example.net>/api/public/v1.0/groups/<group_id>/automationStatus" --digest -i
  - pre: |
      The command returns the ``processes`` array and the ``goalVersion``
      field. The ``processes`` array contains a document for each server
      that is to run a MongoDB instance, similar to the following:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      {
        "plan": [],
        "lastGoalVersionAchieved": 2,
        "name": "<process_name_1>",
        "hostname": "<server_1.example.net>",
      }
post: |
  If any document has a ``lastGoalVersionAchieved`` field equal to ``1``,
  the configuration is in the process of deploying. The document's ``plan`` field
  displays the remaining work. Wait several seconds and issue the
  ``curl`` command again.

  When all ``lastGoalVersionAchieved`` fields equal the value
  specified in the ``goalVersion`` field, the new
  configuration has successfully deployed.

  To view the new configuration in the |mms| web interface, select the
  :guilabel:`Deployment` tab and then the :guilabel:`Deployment` page.
