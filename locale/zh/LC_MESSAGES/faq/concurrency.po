"MongoDB allows multiple clients to read and write the same data. In order to"
" ensure consistency, it uses locking and other :term:`concurrency control` "
"measures to prevent multiple clients from modifying the same piece of data "

"single document occur either in full or not at all and that clients never "

"In addition to a shared (S) locking mode for reads and an exclusive (X) "

"For example, when locking a collection for writing (using mode X), both the "
