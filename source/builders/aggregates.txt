Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the `Aggregates <{+core-api+}/client/model/Aggregates>`__
class which provides static factory methods that build :manual:`aggregation pipeline
stages </meta/aggregation-quick-reference/#stages>` in the MongoDB Java driver.

To learn more about aggregation, see our :ref:`Aggregation guide
<java-aggregation>`. To learn how to create expression operations with
discoverable, typesafe Java methods to use in your aggregations, see
:ref:`java-aggregation-expression-operations`.

.. tip::

   For brevity, you can choose to import the methods of the following
   classes statically to make your queries more succinct:

   - ``Aggregates``
   - ``Filters``
   - ``Projections``
   - ``Sorts``
   - ``Accumulators``

   .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
      :start-after: begin static import
      :end-before: end static import
      :language: java
      :dedent:

   The examples on this page assume these static imports, in addition to
   statically importing the ``asList()`` method.

Use these methods to construct pipeline stages and specify them in your
aggregation as a list:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: begin aggregationSample
   :end-before: end aggregationSample
   :language: java
   :dedent:


Match
-----

Use the ``match()`` method to create a :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>`
pipeline stage that matches incoming documents against the specified
query filter, filtering out documents that do not match.

.. tip::

   The filter can be an instance of any class that implements ``Bson``, but it's
   convenient to combine with use of the :ref:`Filters <filters-builders>` class.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that matches all documents where the
``title`` field is equal to "The Shawshank Redemption":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: begin match
   :end-before: end match
   :language: java
   :dedent:


Project
-------

Use the ``project()`` method to create a :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project/>`
pipeline stage that project specified document fields. Field projection
in aggregation follows the same rules as :ref:`field projection in queries <java-fundamentals-project>`.

.. tip::

   Though the projection can be an instance of any class that implements ``Bson``,
   it's convenient to combine with use of :ref:`Projections <projections-builders>`.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that excludes the ``_id`` field but
includes the ``title`` and ``plot`` fields:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: begin project
   :end-before: end project
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Projecting Computed Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``$project`` stage can project computed fields as well.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that projects the ``rated`` field
into a new field called ``rating``, effectively renaming the field.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: begin computed
   :end-before: end computed
   :language: java
   :dedent:


Documents
---------

Use the ``documents()`` method to create a
:manual:`$documents </reference/operator/aggregation/documents/>`
pipeline stage that returns literal documents from input values.

.. important::

   If you use a ``$documents`` stage in an aggregation pipeline, it must be the first
   stage in the pipeline.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that creates
sample documents with a ``title`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin documents
   :end-before: // end documents
   :language: java
   :dedent:

.. important::

   If you use the ``documents()`` method to provide the input to an aggregation pipeline,
   you must call the ``aggregate()`` method on a database instead of on a
   collection.


Sample
------

Use the ``sample()`` method to create a :manual:`$sample </reference/operator/aggregation/sample/>`
pipeline stage to randomly select documents from input.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that randomly selects 5 documents:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin sample
   :end-before:  // end sample
   :language: java
   :dedent:



Sort
----

Use the ``sort()`` method to create a  :manual:`$sort </reference/operator/aggregation/sort/>`
pipeline stage to sort by the specified criteria.

.. tip::

   Though the sort criteria can be an instance of any class that
   implements ``Bson``, it's convenient to combine with use of :ref:`Sorts <sorts-builders>`.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that sorts in descending order according
to the value of the ``year`` field and then in ascending order according to the
value of the ``title`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin sortStage
   :end-before: // end sortStage
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Skip
----

Use the ``skip()`` method to create a :manual:`$skip </reference/operator/aggregation/skip/>`
pipeline stage to skip over the specified number of documents before
passing documents into the next stage.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that skips the first ``5`` documents:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin skip
   :end-before: // end skip
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Limit
-----

Use the :manual:`$limit </reference/operator/aggregation/limit/>` pipeline stage
to limit the number of documents passed to the next stage.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that limits the number of documents to ``10``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin limit
   :end-before: // end limit
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Lookup
------

Use the ``lookup()`` method to create a :manual:`$lookup </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/>`
pipeline stage to perform joins and uncorrelated subqueries between two collections.

Left Outer Join
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example creates a pipeline stage that performs a left outer
join between the ``movies`` and ``comments`` collections:

- It joins the ``_id`` field from ``movies`` to the ``movie_id`` field in ``comments``
- It outputs the results in the ``joined_comments`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin basic lookup
   :end-before: // end basic lookup
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Full Join and Uncorrelated Subqueries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example creates a pipeline stage that joins two collections, ``orders``
and ``warehouses``, by the item and whether the available quantity is enough
to fulfill the ordered quantity:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin advanced lookup
   :end-before: // end advanced lookup
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Group
-----

Use the ``group()`` method to create a :manual:`$group </reference/operator/aggregation/group/>`
pipeline stage to group documents by a specified expression and output a document
for each distinct grouping.

.. tip::

   The driver includes the `Accumulators <{+core-api+}/client/model/Accumulators.html>`__
   class with static factory methods for each of the supported accumulators.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that groups documents by the value
of the ``customerId`` field. Each group accumulates the sum and average
of the values of the ``quantity`` field into the ``totalQuantity`` and
``averageQuantity`` fields.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin group
   :end-before: // end group
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Learn more about accumulator operators from the Server manual section
on :manual:`Accumulators </reference/operator/aggregation/#std-label-agg-operators-group-accumulators>`.

.. _java_aggregates_pick_n:

Pick-N Accumulators
-------------------

The pick-n accumulators are aggregation accumulation operators that return
the top and bottom elements given a specific ordering. Use one of the
following builders to create an aggregation accumulation operator:

- :ref:`minN() <java_aggregates_min_n>`
- :ref:`maxN() <java_aggregates_max_n>`
- :ref:`firstN() <java_aggregates_first_n>`
- :ref:`lastN() <java_aggregates_last_n>`
- :ref:`top() <java_aggregates_top>`
- :ref:`topN() <java_aggregates_top_n>`
- :ref:`bottom() <java_aggregates_bottom>`
- :ref:`bottomN() <java_aggregates_bottom_n>`

.. tip::

   You can only perform aggregation operations with these pick-n accumulators
   when running MongoDB v5.2 or later.

Learn which aggregation pipeline stages you can use accumulator operators with
from the Server manual section on
:manual:`Accumulators </reference/operator/aggregation/#std-label-agg-operators-group-accumulators>`.

.. _java_aggregates_min_n:

MinN
~~~~

The ``minN()`` builder creates the :manual:`$minN </reference/operator/aggregation/minN/>`
accumulator which returns data from documents that contain the ``n`` lowest
values of a grouping.

.. tip::

   The ``$minN`` and ``$bottomN`` accumulators can perform similar tasks.
   See
   :manual:`Comparison of $minN and $bottomN Accumulators </reference/operator/aggregation/minN/#comparison-of--minn-and--bottomn-accumulators>`
   for recommended usage of each.

The following example demonstrates how to use the ``minN()`` method to return
the lowest three ``imdb.rating`` values for movies, grouped by ``year``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AccumulatorsPickN.java
   :start-after: // begin minN accumulator
   :end-before: // end minN accumulator
   :language: java
   :dedent:

See the `minN() API documentation <{+core-api+}/client/model/Accumulators.html#minN(java.lang.String,InExpression,NExpression)>`__
for more information.

.. _java_aggregates_max_n:

MaxN
~~~~

The ``maxN()`` accumulator returns data from documents that contain the ``n``
highest values of a grouping.

The following example demonstrates how to use the ``maxN()`` method to
return the highest two ``imdb.rating`` values for movies, grouped by ``year``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AccumulatorsPickN.java
   :start-after: // begin maxN accumulator
   :end-before: // end maxN accumulator
   :language: java
   :dedent:

See the `maxN() API documentation <{+core-api+}/client/model/Accumulators.html#maxN(java.lang.String,InExpression,NExpression)>`__
for more information.

.. _java_aggregates_first_n:

FirstN
~~~~~~

The ``firstN()`` accumulator returns data from the first ``n`` documents in
each grouping for the specified sort order.

.. tip::

   The ``$firstN`` and ``$topN`` accumulators can perform similar tasks.
   See
   :manual:`Comparison of $firstN and $topN Accumulators </reference/operator/aggregation/firstN/#comparison-of--firstn-and--topn-accumulators>`
   for recommended usage of each.

The following example demonstrates how to use the ``firstN()`` method to
return the first four movie ``title`` values, based on the order they came
into the stage, grouped by ``year``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AccumulatorsPickN.java
   :start-after: // begin firstN accumulator
   :end-before: // end firstN accumulator
   :language: java
   :dedent:

See the `firstN() API documentation <{+core-api+}/client/model/Accumulators.html#firstN(java.lang.String,InExpression,NExpression)>`__
for more information.

.. _java_aggregates_last_n:

LastN
~~~~~

The ``lastN()`` accumulator returns data from the last ``n`` documents in
each grouping for the specified sort order.

The following example demonstrates how to use the ``lastN()`` method to show
the last three movie ``title`` values, based on the the order they came into
the stage, grouped by ``year``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AccumulatorsPickN.java
   :start-after: // begin lastN accumulator
   :end-before: // end lastN accumulator
   :language: java
   :dedent:

See the `lastN() API documentation <{+core-api+}/client/model/Accumulators.html#lastN(java.lang.String,InExpression,NExpression)>`__
for more information.

.. _java_aggregates_top:

Top
~~~

The ``top()`` accumulator returns data from the first document in a group
based on the specified sort order.

The following example demonstrates how to use the ``top()`` method to return
the ``title`` and ``imdb.rating`` values for the top rated movies based on the
``imdb.rating``, grouped by ``year``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AccumulatorsPickN.java
   :start-after: // begin top accumulator
   :end-before: // end top accumulator
   :language: java
   :dedent:

See the `top() API documentation <{+core-api+}/client/model/Accumulators.html#top(java.lang.String,org.bson.conversions.Bson,OutExpression)>`__
for more information.

.. _java_aggregates_top_n:

TopN
~~~~

The ``topN()`` accumulator returns data from documents that contain the
highest ``n`` values for the specified field.

.. tip::

   The ``$firstN`` and ``$topN`` accumulators can perform similar tasks.
   See
   :manual:`Comparison of $firstN and $topN Accumulators </reference/operator/aggregation/firstN/#comparison-of--firstn-and--topn-accumulators>`
   for recommended usage of each.

The following example demonstrates how to use the ``topN()`` method to return
the ``title`` and ``runtime`` values of the three longest movies based on the
``runtime`` values, grouped by ``year``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AccumulatorsPickN.java
   :start-after: // begin topN accumulator
   :end-before: // end topN accumulator
   :language: java
   :dedent:

See the `topN() API documentation <{+core-api+}/client/model/Accumulators.html#topN(java.lang.String,org.bson.conversions.Bson,OutExpression,NExpression)>`__
for more information.

.. _java_aggregates_bottom:

Bottom
~~~~~~

The ``bottom()`` accumulator returns data from the last document in a group
based on the specified sort order.

The following example demonstrates how to use the ``bottom()`` method to
return the ``title`` and ``runtime`` values of the shortest movie based on the
``runtime`` value, grouped by ``year``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AccumulatorsPickN.java
   :start-after: // begin bottom accumulator
   :end-before: // end bottom accumulator
   :language: java
   :dedent:

See the `bottom() API documentation <{+core-api+}/client/model/Accumulators.html#bottom(java.lang.String,org.bson.conversions.Bson,OutExpression)>`__
for more information.

.. _java_aggregates_bottom_n:

BottomN
~~~~~~~

The ``bottomN()`` accumulator returns data from documents that contain the
lowest ``n`` values for the specified field.

.. tip::

   The ``$minN`` and ``$bottomN`` accumulators can perform similar tasks.
   See :manual:`Comparison of $minN and $bottomN Accumulators </reference/operator/aggregation/minN/#comparison-of--minn-and--bottomn-accumulators>`
   for recommended usage of each.

The following example demonstrates how to use the ``bottomN()`` method to
return the ``title`` and ``imdb.rating`` values of the two lowest rated movies
based on the ``imdb.rating`` value, grouped by ``year``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AccumulatorsPickN.java
   :start-after: // begin bottomN accumulator
   :end-before: // end bottomN accumulator
   :language: java
   :dedent:

See the `bottomN() API documentation <{+core-api+}/client/model/Accumulators.html#bottomN(java.lang.String,org.bson.conversions.Bson,OutExpression,NExpression)>`__
for more information.

Unwind
------

Use the ``unwind()`` method to create an :manual:`$unwind </reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/>`
pipeline stage to deconstruct an array field from input documents, creating
an output document for each array element.

The following example creates a document for each element in the ``sizes`` array:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin unwindStage
   :end-before: // end unwindStage
   :language: java
   :dedent:

To preserve documents that have missing or ``null``
values for the array field, or where array is empty:


.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin unwindPreserve
   :end-before: // end unwindPreserve
   :language: java
   :dedent:

To include the array index, in this example in a field called ``"position"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin unwindIndex
   :end-before: // end unwindIndex
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Out
---

Use the ``out()`` method to create an :manual:`$out </reference/operator/aggregation/out/>`
pipeline stage that writes all documents to the specified collection in
the same database.

.. important::

   The ``$out`` stage must be the last stage in any aggregation pipeline.

The following example writes the results of the pipeline to the ``authors``
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin out
   :end-before: // end out
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Merge
-----

Use the ``merge()`` method to create a :manual:`$merge </reference/operator/aggregation/merge/>`
pipeline stage that merges all documents into the specified collection.

.. important::

   The ``$merge`` stage must be the last stage in any aggregation pipeline.

The following example merges the pipeline into the ``authors`` collection using the default
options:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin mergeStage
   :end-before: // end mergeStage
   :language: java
   :dedent:

The following example merges the pipeline into the ``customers`` collection in the
``reporting`` database using some options that specify to replace
the document if both ``date`` and ``customerId`` match, otherwise insert the
document:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin mergeOptions
   :end-before: // end mergeOptions
   :language: java
   :dedent:

GraphLookup
-----------

Use the ``graphLookup()`` method to create a :manual:`$graphLookup </reference/operator/aggregation/graphLookup/>`
pipeline stage that performs a recursive search on a specified collection to match
a specified field in one document to a specified field of another document.

The following example computes the social network graph for users in the
``contacts`` collection, recursively matching the value in the ``friends`` field
to the ``name`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin graphLookupBasic
   :end-before: // end graphLookupBasic
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Using ``GraphLookupOptions``, you can specify the depth to recurse as well as
the name of the depth field, if desired. In this example, ``$graphLookup`` will
recurse up to two times, and create a field called ``degrees`` with the
recursion depth information for every document.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin graphLookupDepth
   :end-before: // end graphLookupDepth
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Using ``GraphLookupOptions``, you can specify a filter that documents must match
in order for MongoDB to include them in your search. In this
example, only links with "golf" in their ``hobbies`` field will be included.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin graphLookupMatch
   :end-before: // end graphLookupMatch
   :language: java
   :dedent:

SortByCount
-----------

Use the ``sortByCount()`` method to create a :manual:`$sortByCount </reference/operator/aggregation/sortByCount/>`
pipeline stage that groups documents by a given expression and then sorts
these groups by count in descending order.

.. tip::

   The ``$sortByCount`` stage is identical to a ``$group`` stage with a
   ``$sum`` accumulator followed by a ``$sort`` stage.

   .. code-block:: json

      [
          { "$group": { "_id": <expression to group on>, "count": { "$sum": 1 } } },
          { "$sort": { "count": -1 } }
      ]

The following example groups documents by the truncated value of the field ``x``
and computes the count for each distinct value:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin sortByCount
   :end-before: // end sortByCount
   :language: java
   :dedent:


ReplaceRoot
-----------

Use the ``replaceRoot()`` method to create a :manual:`$replaceRoot </reference/operator/aggregation/replaceRoot/>`
pipeline stage that replaces each input document with the specified document.

The following example replaces each input document with the nested document
in the ``spanish_translation`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin replaceRoot
   :end-before: // end replaceRoot
   :language: java
   :dedent:

AddFields
---------

Use the ``addFields()`` method to create an :manual:`$addFields </reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/>`
pipeline stage that adds new fields to documents.

.. tip::

   Use ``$addFields`` when you do not want to project field inclusion
   or exclusion.

The following example adds two new fields, ``a`` and ``b`` to the input documents:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin addFields
   :end-before: // end addFields
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Count
-----

Use the ``count()`` method to create a :manual:`$count </reference/operator/aggregation/count/>`
pipeline stage that counts the number of documents that enter the stage, and assigns
that value to a specified field name. If you do not specify a field,
``count()`` defaults the field name to "count".

.. tip::

   The ``$count`` stage is syntactic sugar for:

   .. code-block:: json

      { "$group":{ "_id": 0, "count": { "$sum" : 1 } } }

The following example creates a pipeline stage that outputs the count of incoming
documents in a field called "total":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin count
   :end-before: // end count
   :language: java
   :dedent:


Bucket
------

Use the ``bucket()`` method to create a :manual:`$bucket </reference/operator/aggregation/bucket/>`
pipeline stage that automates the bucketing of data around predefined boundary
values.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that groups incoming documents based
on the value of their ``screenSize`` field, inclusive of the lower boundary
and exclusive of the upper boundary.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin basicBucket
   :end-before: // end basicBucket
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Use the ``BucketOptions`` class to specify a default bucket for values
outside of the specified boundaries, and to specify additional accumulators.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that groups incoming documents based
on the value of their ``screenSize`` field, counting the number of documents
that fall within each bucket, pushing the value of ``screenSize`` into a
field called ``matches``, and capturing any screen sizes greater than "70"
into a bucket called "monster" for monstrously large screen sizes:

.. tip::

   The driver includes the `Accumulators <{+core-api+}/client/model/Accumulators.html>`__
   class with static factory methods for each of the supported accumulators.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin bucketOptions
   :end-before: // end bucketOptions
   :language: java
   :dedent:

BucketAuto
----------

Use the ``bucketAuto()`` method to create a :manual:`$bucketAuto </reference/operator/aggregation/bucketAuto/>`
pipeline stage that automatically determines the boundaries of each bucket
in its attempt to distribute the documents evenly into a specified number of buckets.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that will attempt to create and evenly
distribute documents into *10* buckets using the value of their ``price`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin bucketAutoBasic
   :end-before: // end bucketAutoBasic
   :language: java
   :dedent:


Use the ``BucketAutoOptions`` class to specify a :wikipedia:`preferred number <Preferred_number>`
based scheme to set boundary values, and specify additional accumulators.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that will attempt to create and evenly
distribute documents into *10* buckets using the value of their ``price`` field,
setting the bucket boundaries at powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, ...). It also counts
the number of documents in each bucket, and calculates their average ``price``
in a new field called ``avgPrice``:

.. tip::

   The driver includes the `Accumulators <{+core-api+}/client/model/Accumulators.html>`__
   class with static factory methods for each of the supported accumulators.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin bucketAutoOptions
   :end-before: // end bucketAutoOptions
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Facet
-----

Use the ``facet()`` method to create a :manual:`$facet </reference/operator/aggregation/facet/>`
pipeline stage that allows for the definition of parallel pipelines.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that executes two parallel aggregations:

- The first aggregation distributes incoming documents into 5 groups according to
  their ``attributes.screen_size`` field.

- The second aggregation counts all *manufacturers* and returns their count, limited
  to the top **5**.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin facet
   :end-before: // end facet
   :language: java
   :dedent:

.. _builders-aggregates-setWindowFields:

SetWindowFields
---------------

Use the ``setWindowFields()`` method to create a :manual:`$setWindowFields </reference/operator/aggregation/setWindowFields/>`
pipeline stage that allows using window operators to perform operations
on a specified span of documents in a collection.

.. tip:: Window Functions

   The driver includes the `Windows <{+core-api+}/client/model/Windows.html>`__
   class with static factory methods for building windowed computations.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that computes the
accumulated rainfall and the average temperature over the past month for
each locality from more fine-grained measurements presented in the ``rainfall``
and ``temperature`` fields:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggBuilders.java
   :start-after: // begin setWindowFields
   :end-before: // end setWindowFields
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Densify
-------

Use the ``densify()`` method to create a
:manual:`$densify </reference/operator/aggregation/densify/>` pipeline
stage that generates a sequence of documents to span a specified interval.

.. tip::

   You can use the ``$densify()`` aggregation stage only when running
   MongoDB v5.1 or later.

Consider the following documents retrieved from the :atlas:`Atlas sample weather dataset </sample-data/sample-weather>`
that contain measurements for a similar ``position`` field, spaced one hour
apart:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Document{{ _id=5553a..., position=Document{{type=Point, coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 08:00:00 EST 1984, ... }}
   Document{{ _id=5553b..., position=Document{{type=Point, coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 09:00:00 EST 1984, ... }}

Suppose you needed to create a pipeline stage that performs the following
actions on these documents:

- Add a document at every 15-minute interval for which a ``ts`` value does not
  already exist.
- Group the documents by the ``position`` field.

The call to the ``densify()`` aggregation stage builder that accomplishes
these actions resembles the following:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggregateDensify.java
   :start-after: // begin densify aggregate
   :end-before: // end densify aggregate
   :language: java
   :dedent:

The following output highlights the documents generated by the aggregate stage
which contain ``ts`` values every 15 minutes between the existing documents:

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 2-4
   :copyable: false

   Document{{ _id=5553a..., position=Document{{type=Point, coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 08:00:00 EST 1984, ... }}
   Document{{ position=Document{{coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 08:15:00 EST 1984 }}
   Document{{ position=Document{{coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 08:30:00 EST 1984 }}
   Document{{ position=Document{{coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 08:45:00 EST 1984 }}
   Document{{ _id=5553b..., position=Document{{type=Point, coordinates=[-47.9, 47.6]}}, ts=Mon Mar 05 09:00:00 EST 1984, ... }}

for more information.

Fill
----

Use the ``fill()`` method to create a
`$fill <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/upcoming/reference/operator/aggregation/fill/>`__
pipeline stage that populates ``null`` and missing field values.

.. tip::

   You can use the ``$fill()`` aggregation stage only when running
   MongoDB v5.3 or later.

Consider the following documents that contain temperature and air pressure
measurements at an hourly interval:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Document{{_id=6308a..., hour=1, temperature=23C, air_pressure=29.74}}
   Document{{_id=6308b..., hour=2, temperature=23.5C}}
   Document{{_id=6308c..., hour=3, temperature=null, air_pressure=29.76}}

Suppose you needed to populate missing temperature and air pressure
data points in the documents as follows:

- Populate the ``air_pressure`` field for hour "2" using linear interpolation
  to calculate the value.
- Set the missing ``temperature`` value to "23.6C" for hour "3".

The call to the ``fill()`` aggregation stage builder that accomplishes
these actions resembles the following:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggregateFill.java
   :start-after: // begin fill aggregate
   :end-before: // end fill aggregate
   :language: java
   :dedent:

The following output highlights the documents that contain fields populated
by the aggregate stage:

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 2,3
   :copyable: false

   Document{{_id=6308a..., hour=1, temperature=23C, air_pressure=29.74}}
   Document{{_id=6308b..., hour=2, temperature=23.5C, air_pressure=29.75}}
   Document{{_id=6308c..., hour=3, temperature=23.6C, air_pressure=29.76}}

See the `fill package API documentation <{+core-api+}/client/model/fill/package-summary.html>`__
for more information.

Atlas Full-Text Search
----------------------

Use the ``search()`` method to create a :manual:`$search </reference/operator/aggregation/search/>`
pipeline stage that specifies a full-text search of one or more fields.

.. tip:: Only Available on Atlas for MongoDB v4.2 and later

   This aggregation pipeline operator is only available for collections hosted
   on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` clusters running v4.2 or later that are
   covered by an :atlas:`Atlas search index </reference/atlas-search/index-definitions/>`.
   Learn more about the required setup and the functionality of this operator
   from the :ref:`Atlas Search <fts-top-ref>` documentation.

The following example creates a pipeline stage that searches the ``title``
field for text that contains the word "Future":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggregateSearchBuilderExample.java
   :start-after: // begin atlasTextSearch
   :end-before: // end atlasTextSearch
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Learn more about the builders from the
`search package API documentation <{+core-api+}/client/model/search/package-summary.html>`__.

Atlas Search Metadata
---------------------

Use the ``searchMeta()`` method to create a
:manual:`$searchMeta </reference/operator/aggregation/searchMeta/>`
pipeline stage which returns only the metadata part of the results from
Atlas full-text search queries.

.. tip:: Only Available on Atlas for MongoDB v4.4.11 and later

   This aggregation pipeline operator is only available
   on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` clusters running v4.4.11 and later. For a
   detailed list of version availability, see the MongoDB Atlas documentation
   on :atlas:`$searchMeta </atlas-search/query-syntax/#-searchmeta>`.

The following example shows the ``count`` metadata for an Atlas search
aggregation stage:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/builders/AggregateSearchBuilderExample.java
   :start-after: // begin atlasSearchMeta
   :end-before: // end atlasSearchMeta
   :language: java
   :dedent:

Learn more about this helper from the
`searchMeta() API documentation <{+core-api+}/client/model/Aggregates.html#searchMeta(com.mongodb.client.model.search.SearchCollector)>`__.
