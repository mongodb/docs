A MongoDB view is a read-only queryable object whose contents are
defined by an :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` on
other collections or views.

MongoDB does not persist the view contents to disk. A view's content is
computed on-demand when a client queries the view.

Use Cases
---------

You can use views to:

- Create a view on a collection of employee data to exclude any
  personally identifiable information (PII). Your application can query
  the view for employee data that does not contain any :abbr:`PII
  (Personally Identifiable Information)`.

- Create a view on a collection of sensor data to add computed fields
  and metrics. Your application can use :method:`find operations
  <db.collection.find()>` to query the computed data.

- Create a view that joins two collections containing inventory and
  order history. Your application can query the view without managing or
  understanding the underlying pipeline.

Behavior
--------

The following sections describe behavior specific to views.

Read Only
~~~~~~~~~

Views are read-only. Write operations on views return an error.

Index Use
~~~~~~~~~

Views use the indexes of the underlying collection. As a result, you
cannot create, drop or re-build indexes on the view directly, nor get
a list of indexes on the view.

View Pipelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The view's underlying aggregation pipeline is subject to the 100
megabyte memory limit for blocking sort and blocking group
operations. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-allowDiskUseByDefault.rst

Sharded Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Views are considered sharded if their underlying collection is sharded.
You cannot specify a sharded view for the ``from`` field in
:pipeline:`$lookup` and :pipeline:`$graphLookup` operations.

Time Series Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot create a view from a :ref:`time series
<manual-timeseries-collection>` bucket collection namespace (namely, a
collection prefixed with ``system.buckets``).
