Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to insert documents with the MongoDB Java
driver. 

You can use MongoDB to retrieve, update, and delete information. To
perform any of those operations, that information, such as user profiles
and orders, needs to exist in MongoDB. For that information to exist,
first perform an insert operation.

An insert operation inserts a single or multiple documents into MongoDB
using the  ``insertOne()``, ``insertMany()``, and ``bulkWrite()``
methods. 

The following sections focus on ``insertOne()`` and
``insertMany()``. For information on how to use the ``bulkWrite()``
method, see our
:doc:`guide on Bulk Operations </crud/write-operations/bulk/>`. 

A Note About ``_id``
--------------------

When inserting a document, MongoDB enforces one constraint on your
documents by default: each document *must* contain a unique ``_id``
field. 

There are two ways to manage this field:

- You can manage this field yourself, ensuring each value you use is unique.
- You can let the driver automatically generate unique ObjectId values.

Unless you have provided strong guarantees for uniqueness, we recommend
you let the driver automatically generate ``_id`` values. 

.. note::

   Duplicate ``_id`` values violate unique index constraints, resulting
   in a ``WriteError``. 
 
For additional information on unique indexes, see the manual entry on 
:manual:`Unique Indexes </core/index-unique/>`.

Insert a Single Document
------------------------

Use the ``insertOne()`` method when you want to insert a single
document. 

On successful insertion, the method returns an ``InsertOneResult``
instance representing the ``_id`` of the new document. 

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example creates and inserts a document using the
``insertOne()`` method: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Insert.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertOneExample
   :end-before: end insertOneExample

The output of the preceding code resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Inserted a document with the following id: 60930c39a982931c20ef6cd6

Insert Multiple Documents
-------------------------

Use the ``insertMany()`` method when you want to insert multiple
documents. This method inserts documents in the order specified until an
exception occurs, if any.

For example, assume you want to insert the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": 3, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
   { "_id": 4, "color": "purple", "qty": 10 }
   { "_id": 3, "color": "yellow", "qty": 3 }
   { "_id": 6, "color": "blue", "qty": 8 }

If you attempt to insert these documents, a ``WriteError`` occurs at the
third document and the documents prior to the error get inserted into
your collection. 

.. tip::

   Use a try-catch block to get an acknowledgment for successfully
   processed documents before the error occurs:

   .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Insert.java
      :language: java
      :dedent:
      :start-after: begin insertManyErrorExample
      :end-before: end insertManyErrorExample

   The output consists of documents MongoDB can process and should look
   something like this:

   .. code-block:: 
      :copyable: false
      
      A MongoBulkWriteException occurred, but there are successfully processed 
      documents with the following ids: [3, 4, 6] 
   
   If you look inside your collection, you should see the following documents:
   
   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false

      { "_id": 3, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
      { "_id": 4, "color": "purple", "qty": 10 }

On successful insertion, the method returns an ``InsertManyResult``
instance representing the ``_id`` of each new document. 

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example creates and adds two documents to a ``List``, and
inserts the ``List`` using the ``insertMany()`` method: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Insert.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertManyExample
   :end-before: end insertManyExample

The output of the preceding code resembles the following:

.. code-block::
   :copyable: false

   Inserted documents with the following ids: [60930c3aa982931c20ef6cd7, 60930c3aa982931c20ef6cd8]

Summary
-------

There are three ways to perform an insert operation, but we focused on two:

- The ``insertOne()`` method inserts a single document.
- The ``insertMany()`` method inserts multiple documents.

Both methods automatically generate an ``_id`` if you omit the field in
your document. 

If the insertion is successful, both methods return an instance
representing the ``_id`` of each new document.
