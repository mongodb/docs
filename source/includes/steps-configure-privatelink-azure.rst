      #. Disable private endpoint network policies by copying the 
         ``az network vnet subnet update`` command the dialog box 
         displays and running it using the |azure| CLI.

         For more information about this command, see the :azure:`Azure
         documentation </private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy>`.

      #. Create the private endpoint in your VNet by copying the 
         ``az network private-endpoint create`` command the dialog box 
         displays and running it using the |azure| CLI.

         .. note::
        
            You can't copy the command until |service| finishes
            creating VNet resources in the background.

            For more information about this command, see the 
            `Azure documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/network/private-endpoint?view=azure-cli-latest#az_network_private_endpoint_create>`__.

      #. You might receive an error like the following when you create

         If you receive this error, you must add the 
         ``--manual-request true`` parameter to the |azure| CLI command 
         you used to create the private endpoint, then run the command 
         again.

      You can connect to an |service| cluster using the {+az-pl+} private 
      endpoint when all of the resources are configured and the private
      endpoint becomes available.
      
      To verify that the {+az-pl+} private endpoint is available:
      
      On the :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` tab, select a 
      {+database-deployment+} type and verify the following 
      statuses for the region that contains the cluster 
      you want to connect to using {+az-pl+}:
