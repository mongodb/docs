Installing from source
======================

System Requirements
-------------------

On macOS, you need a working modern XCode installation with the XCode
Command Line Tools. Additionally, you need CMake and pkg-config::

  $ xcode-select --install
  $ brew install cmake
  $ brew install pkg-config

On Linux, installation requires gcc 12, CMake and pkg-config.

Windows is not yet supported.

Environment Setup
-----------------

First, clone the mongo-arrow git repository::

  $ git clone https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-arrow.git
  $ cd mongo-arrow/bindings/python

Additionally, create a virtualenv in which to install ``pymongoarrow``
from sources::

  $ virtualenv pymongoarrow
  $ source ./pymongoarrow/bin/activate
  $ pip install tox

libbson
^^^^^^^

PyMongoArrow uses `libbson <http://mongoc.org/libbson/current/index.html>`_.
Detailed instructions for building/installing ``libbson`` can be found
`here <http://mongoc.org/libmongoc/1.21.0/installing.html#installing-the-mongodb-c-driver-libmongoc-and-bson-library-libbson>`_.


You can either use a system-provided version of ``libbson`` that is properly
configured for use with ``pkg-config``, or use the provided ``build-libbson.sh`` script to build it::

  $ LIBBSON_INSTALL_DIR=$(pwd)/libbson tox -e build-libbson

On macOS, users can install the latest ``libbson`` using Homebrew::

  $ brew install mongo-c-driver

Conda users can install ``libbson`` as follows::

  $ conda install --channel conda-forge libbson pkg-config

The minimum required version is listed in ``pymongoarrow/version.py``.
If you try to build with a lower version a ``ValueError`` will be raised.

Build
-----

Typically we will use the provided ``tox`` scripts and will not build directly, but you can build and
test in the created virtualenv.

In the previously created virtualenv, to install PyMongoArrow and its test dependencies in editable mode::

  (pymongoarrow) $ pip install -v -e ".[test]"

If you built libbson using the ``build-libbson`` script then use the same ``LIBBSON_INSTALL_DIR`` as above:

  (pymongoarrow) $ LIBBSON_INSTALL_DIR=$(pwd)/libbson pip install -v -e ".[test]"

Test
----

To run the test suite, you will need a MongoDB instance running on
``localhost`` using port ``27017``. To run the entire test suite, do::

  (pymongoarrow) $ tox -e test

or, if not using ``tox``:

  (pymongoarrow) $ pytest


Running Linters
---------------

PyMongoArrow uses `pre-commit <https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit/>`_
for managing linting of the codebase.
``pre-commit`` performs various checks on all files in PyMongoArrow and uses tools
that help follow a consistent code style within the codebase.

To set up ``pre-commit`` locally, run::

    (pymongoarrow) $ pip install pre-commit
    (pymongoarrow) $ pre-commi t install

To run ``pre-commit`` manually, run::

    (pymongoarrow) $ tox -e lint
