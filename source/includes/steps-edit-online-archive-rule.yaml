title: "Select :guilabel:`Edit Archive` from the dropdown to make 
       changes to your archiving rule, the number of days to keep 
       archived data, and the time window for running data archiving 
       jobs."

  You can change the archiving criteria and the number of days after 
  which to delete archived data.

  - To edit :guilabel:`Date Match` criteria, modify the number of 
    days |service| stores data on the active |service| cluster in the 
    :guilabel:`Archival Age Limit` section.

  - To edit :guilabel:`Custom Criteria`, enter a valid |json| filter 
    to select the documents for archiving. 

    .. note::

       |service| uses the specified query with the 
       :manual:`db.collection.find(query) 
       </reference/method/db.collection.find/>` command. Custom queries 
       do not support JavaScript expressions. Also, you can't pass an 
       empty document ``{}`` to return all documents.

  - To modify the number of days after which |service| deletes archived 
    data, enter or modify the number of days in the :guilabel:`Deletion 
    Age Limit` section. You can specify between ``7`` and ``9125`` 
    days, or leave the field empty to disable the data expiration rule. 
    It takes 24 hours for this change to take effect. 

    .. include:: /includes/fact-oa-data-expiration-preview.rst

  - To modify the scheduled time for data archiving jobs, make changes 
    to any of the following: 

    - Frequency. You can choose to run the job every day, on a specific 
      day of the week, or on a specific date every month. If you 
      wish to archive on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of every month, 
      |service| doesn't run the archiving job for those months that 
      don't include those dates. 
    - Time window. Select the period of time during which you want 
      |service| to run the data archiving job. You must specify a 
      minimum of two hours.

    You can also disable the schedule by toggling :guilabel:`Schedule 
    Archive Window`. If you disable the schedule, |service| reverts to 
    the default schedule and :ref:`runs the archiving job periodically 
    <online-archive-job>`.

    |service| starts using the new data archiving schedule immediately 
    after you change it. However, if an archiving job is currently 
    running, |service| doesn't interrupt the running job and the 
    setting takes effect after the job completes.
