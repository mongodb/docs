Perform Bulk Operations
=======================

.. meta::
   :description: Perform batch write operations using the bulkWrite() method in the MongoDB Node.js Driver to increase throughput and performance by reducing network round trips.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The ``bulkWrite()`` method performs batch write operations against a
*single* collection. This method reduces the number of network round trips from
your application to the server which therefore increases the throughput and
performance. Bulk writes return a collection of results for all operations
only after *all* operations passed to the method complete.

You can specify one or more of the following write operations in
``bulkWrite()``:

- ``insertOne``
- ``updateOne``
- ``updateMany``
- ``deleteOne``
- ``deleteMany``
- ``replaceOne``

The ``bulkWrite()`` method accepts the following parameters:

- ``operations``: specifies the bulk write operations to
  perform. Pass each operation to ``bulkWrite()`` as an object in
  an array. For examples that show the syntax for each write operation, see
  the `bulkWrite API documentation <{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#bulkWrite>`__.

- ``options``: *optional* settings that affect the execution
  of the operation, such as whether the write operations executes in
  sequential order and the write concern.

  By default, MongoDB executes bulk write operations one-by-one in the specified order
  (serially). During an ordered bulk write, if an error occurs during the processing of an
  operation, MongoDB returns without processing the remaining operations in the list. In
  contrast, when ``ordered`` is ``false``, MongoDB continues to process remaining write
  operations in the list. Unordered operations are theoretically faster since MongoDB can
  execute them in parallel, but only use them if the writes do not depend on order.

If you create an index with a :manual:`unique index </core/index-unique>`
constraint, you might encounter a duplicate key write error during an
operation in the following format:

.. code-block:: sh

   Error during bulkWrite, BulkWriteError: E11000 duplicate key error collection: ...

Similarly, if you attempt to perform a bulk write against a collection
that uses :manual:`schema validation </core/schema-validation>`, you may
encounter warnings or errors related to the formatting of inserted or
modified documents.

Example
-------

The following code sample performs a bulk write operation on the
``theaters`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database. The example call
to ``bulkWrite()`` includes examples of ``insertOne``, ``updateMany``, and
``deleteOne`` write operations:

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: JavaScript
      :tabid: javascript

      .. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/usage-examples/bulkWrite.js
         :language: javascript
         :linenos:

   .. tab:: TypeScript
      :tabid: typescript

      .. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/usage-examples/bulkWrite.ts
         :language: typescript
         :linenos:

Running the preceding example results in the following output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   BulkWriteResult {
     insertedCount: 2,
     matchedCount: 1,
     modifiedCount: 1,
     deletedCount: 0,
     upsertedCount: 0,
     upsertedIds: {},
     insertedIds: {
       '0': new ObjectId("..."),
       '1': new ObjectId("...")
     }
   }
