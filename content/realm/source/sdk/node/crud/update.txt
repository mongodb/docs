.. _node-update-an-object:

Update an Object
----------------

You can add, modify, or delete properties of a Realm object inside
of a write transaction in the same way that you would update any other
JavaScript object.

.. tip:: Update Related and Embedded Objects
   
   To update a property of an :ref:`embedded object <node-embedded-objects>` or
   a :ref:`related object <node-client-relationships>`, modify the property with
   :mdn:`dot-notation or bracket-notation
   <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors>` as if it were in a
   regular, nested object.

.. _node-upsert-an-object:

Upsert an Object
----------------

To upsert an object, call :js-sdk:`Realm.create() <classes/Realm-1.html#create>` 
with the update mode set to ``modified``. The operation either inserts a 
new object with the given primary key or updates an existing object that 
already has that primary key.

.. _node-update-a-collection:
.. _node-bulk-update:

Bulk Update a Collection
------------------------

To apply an update to a collection of objects, iterate through the collection
(e.g. with :mdn:`for...of
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of>`). In the loop, update each object individually:

.. note:: Inverse Relationships

   Thanks to an :ref:`inverse relationship <node-inverse-relationship>` from
   ``Dog.owner`` to ``Person.dogs``, Realm automatically updates
   Ali's list of dogs whenever we set her as a puppy's owner.
