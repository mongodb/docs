This document provides an overview of the practices and processes.

Commits
-------

When relevant, include a Jira case identifier in a commit
message. Reference documentation cases when applicable, but feel free to
reference other cases from `jira.mongodb.org <http://jira.mongodb.org/>`__.

Remove trailing whitespaces in the source file.

"Hard wrap" files to between 72 and 80 characters per-line.

Standards and Practices
-----------------------

- At least two people should vet all non-trivial
  changes to the documentation before publication. One of the
  reviewers should have significant technical experience with the
  material covered in the documentation.

- All development and editorial work should transpire on GitHub branches
  or forks that editors can then merge into
  the publication branches.

Collaboration
-------------

To propose a change to the documentation, do either of the following:

- Open a ticket in the `documentation project
  <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DOCS>`__ proposing the change.
  Someone on the documentation team will make the change and be in
  contact with you so that you can review the change.

- Using `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__, fork the `mongodb/docs
  repository <https://github.com/mongodb/docs>`__, commit your changes,
  and issue a pull request. Someone on the documentation team will
  review and incorporate your change into the documentation.

Publication
-----------

The makefile for this repository contains targets that automate the
publication process. Use ``make html`` to publish a test build of
the documentation in the ``build/`` directory of your
repository. Use ``make publish`` to build the full contents of the
manual from the current branch in the ``../public-docs/`` directory
relative the docs repository.

Other targets include:

- ``man`` - builds UNIX Manual pages for all Mongodb utilities.
- ``push`` - builds and deploys the contents of the
  ``../public-docs/``.
- ``pdfs`` - builds a PDF version of the manual (requires LaTeX
  dependencies.)

Branches
--------

This section provides an overview of the git branches in the MongoDB
documentation repository and their use.

At the present time, future work transpires in the ``master``, with
the main publication being ``current``. As the documentation
stabilizes, the documentation team will begin to maintain branches of
the documentation for specific MongoDB releases.

Migration from Legacy Documentation
-----------------------------------

The MongoDB.org Wiki contains
a wealth of information. As the transition to the Manual (i.e. this
project and resource) continues, it's *critical* that no information
disappears or goes missing. The following process outlines *how* to
migrate a wiki page to the manual:

1. Read the relevant sections of the Manual, and see what the new
   documentation has to offer on a specific topic.

   In this process you should follow cross references and gain an
   understanding of both the underlying information and how the parts of
   the new content relates its constituent parts.

2. Read the wiki page you wish to redirect, and take note of all of the
   factual assertions, examples presented by the wiki page.

3. Test the factual assertions of the wiki page to the greatest extent
   possible. Ensure that example output is accurate. In the case of
   commands and reference material, make sure that documented options
   are accurate.

4. Make corrections to the manual page or pages to reflect any missing
   pieces of information.

   The target of the redirect need *not* contain every piece of
   information on the wiki page, **if** the manual as a whole does, and
   relevant section(s) with the information from the wiki page are
   accessible from the target of the redirection.

5. As necessary, get these changes reviewed by another writer and/or
   someone familiar with the area of the information in question.

   At this point, update the relevant Jira case with the target that
   you've chosen for the redirect, and make the ticket unassigned.

6. When someone has reviewed the changes and published those changes
   to Manual, you, or preferably someone else on the team, should make
   a final pass at both pages with fresh eyes and then make the
   redirect.

   Steps 1-5 should ensure that no information is lost in the
   migration, and that the final review in step 6 should be trivial to
   complete.

Review Process
--------------

Types of Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The content in the Manual undergoes many types of review, including
the following:

Initial Technical Review
````````````````````````

Review by an engineer familiar with MongoDB and the topic area of
the documentation. This review focuses on technical content, and
correctness of the procedures and facts presented, but can improve
any aspect of the documentation that may still be lacking. When both
the initial technical review and the content review are complete,
the piece may be "published."

Content Review
``````````````

Textual review by another writer to ensure stylistic consistency with
the rest of the manual. Depending on the content, this may precede or
follow the initial technical review. When both the initial technical
review and the content review are complete, the piece may be
"published."

Consistency Review
``````````````````

This occurs post-publication and is content focused. The goals of
consistency reviews are to increase the internal consistency of the
documentation as a whole. Insert relevant cross-references, update the
style as needed, and provide background fact-checking.

When possible, consistency reviews should be as systematic as possible
and we should avoid encouraging stylistic and information drift by
editing only small sections at a time.

Subsequent Technical Review
```````````````````````````

If the documentation needs to be updated following a change in
functionality of the server or following the resolution of a user
issue, changes may be significant enough to warrant additional
technical review. These reviews follow the same form as the "initial
technical review," but is often less involved and covers a smaller
area.

Review Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're not a usual contributor to the documentation and would like
to review something, you can submit reviews in any of the following
methods:

- If you're reviewing an open pull request in GitHub, the best way to
  comment is on the "overview diff," which you can find by clicking on
  the "diff" button in the upper left portion of the screen. You can
  also use the following URL to reach this interface:

  .. code-block:: none

     https://github.com/mongodb/docs/pull/[pull-request-id]/files

  Replace ``[pull-request-id]`` with the identifier of the pull
  request. Make all comments inline, using GitHub's comment system.

  You may also provide comments directly on commits, or on the pull
  request itself but these commit-comments are archived in less
  coherent ways and generate less useful emails, while comments on the
  pull request lead to less specific changes to the document.

- Leave feedback on Jira cases in the `DOCS
  <http://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DOCS>`__ project. These are better
  for more general changes that aren't necessarily tied to a specific
  line, or affect multiple files.

- Create a fork of the repository in your GitHub account, make any
  required changes and then create a pull request with your changes.

  If you insert lines that begin with any of the following
  annotations:

  .. code-block:: none

     .. TODO:
     TODO:
     .. TODO
     TODO

  followed by your comments, it will be easier for the original writer
  to locate your comments. The two dots ``..`` format is a comment in
  reStructured Text, which will hide your comments from Sphinx and
  publication if you're worried about that.

  This format is often easier for reviewers with larger portions of
  content to review.
