Definition
----------

.. method:: db.collection.drop(<options>)

   .. |dbcommand| replace:: :dbcommand:`drop` command
   .. include:: /includes/wayfinding/mongosh-method-drop.rst

   Removes a collection or :ref:`view <views-landing-page>` from the database.
   The method also removes any indexes associated with the dropped
   collection. The method provides a wrapper around the
   :dbcommand:`drop` command.

   :returns: ``true`` 

.. note:: 

   If the specified collection doesn't exist, ``db.collection.drop()`` 
   still returns ``true``.

Compatibility
-------------

.. |operator-method| replace:: ``db.collection.drop()``

.. include:: /includes/fact-compatibility.rst

Syntax
------

The :method:`~db.collection.drop()` method has the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.drop( { writeConcern: <document> } )

The :method:`~db.collection.drop()` method takes an 
optional document with the following field:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - writeConcern
     - Optional. A document expressing the :doc:`write concern
       </reference/write-concern>` of the
       :method:`db.collection.drop()` operation. Omit to use the
       default write concern.

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/mongos-operations-wc-drop.rst
         
Behavior
--------

- The :method:`db.collection.drop()` method and :dbcommand:`drop`
  command create an :ref:`change-event-invalidate` for any
  :doc:`/changeStreams` opened on dropped collection.

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-drop-in-progress-indexes.rst

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-drop-collection-change.rst

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/5.0-changes-drop-sharding.rst

- Starting in MongoDB 6.0, the :method:`db.collection.drop()` method 
  drops the specified collection and any internal collections related 
  to encrypted fields. 

  .. warning::
  
     The :method:`db.collection.drop()` method's behavior differs from
     the driver's ``drop`` method's behavior. The driver's connection 
     must have automatic encryption enabled in order to drop both the 
     specified collection and any internal collections related to
     encrypted fields. ``mongosh`` *always* drops the specified 
     collection and any internal collections related to encrypted
     fields.

Reusing Dropped Collection Names on Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a sharded cluster, if you create a collection that has the same name 
as a previously deleted collection prior to MongoDB 5.0, 
:binary:`~bin.mongos` may forward operations to the wrong shard.
To avoid this situation use the version-specific instructions below:

For a sharded cluster running **MongoDB 5.0 or later**, 
no special action is required. Use the ``drop()`` method
and then create a new collection with the same name.

For a sharded cluster, if you use the ``drop()`` method and then create a new 
collection with the same name, you must either:

-  Flush the cached routing table on every :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   using :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig`.

-  Use :method:`db.collection.remove()` to remove the existing
   documents and reuse the collection.

Flushing the cached routing tables is the preferred procedure because it
is faster than removing sharded collections with 
:method:`db.collection.remove()`. Only use the ``remove()`` approach if 
you want to avoid flushing the cache.

Example
-------

Drop a Collection Using Default Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation drops the ``students`` collection in the
current database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.drop()

Drop a Collection Using ``w: 1`` Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:method:`db.collection.drop()` accepts an options document.

The following operation drops the ``students`` collection in the
current database. The operation uses the
:writeconcern:`1 <\<number\>>` write concern:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.drop( { writeConcern: { w: 1 } } )
