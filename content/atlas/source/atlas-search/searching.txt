The relationship between search queries and search indexes dictates how efficiently and effectively
you can find data within your MongoDB collections using |fts|.

|fts| queries specify the criteria for finding documents within a database. 
|fts| queries take the form of an :manual:`aggregation pipeline </aggregation>`
that begins with the :pipeline:`$search` or :pipeline:`$searchMeta` pipeline stage.
You can use :ref:`operators <fts-operators>`, :ref:`collectors <fts-collectors>`, and 
:ref:`search options <fts-search-options>` inside the pipeline stages to 
implement complex search functionality like full-text search, 
relevance-based ranking, faceted search, filtering, and sorting.

Before you can run a |fts| query, you must create a |fts| index on the fields 
that you want to search. Search indexes are data structures that are optimized to quickly retrieve documents 
that meet the search criteria of your query. When you define a search index, you specify which fields to index and
how these fields should be tokenized.

Effective search queries depend on properly defined search indexes. The fields you intend to search must be indexed,
and your index configuration determines whether your search supports sorting, faceting, autocomplete, and other
search functionality. You can iterate on both query and index design to balance search accuracy with performance.

This page describes how to plan your |fts| search experience and define a |fts| index and query to fit your search requirements.

Plan Your Search Experience
---------------------------

When planning your |fts| implementation, start by defining the search experience you want to deliver:

- Clearly identify what types of searches your application needs to perform. 
  Are you building a search feature for a blog website that needs full-text search and autocomplete for article titles, 
  or an e-commerce site that requires faceted search and filtering by product categories?
- Determine how users will interact with your application. Prioritize features that will enhance the user experience, such as 
  quick response times or accurate autocomplete suggestions. 

Then, consider the following questions to help determine the structure of your |fts| indexes and queries based on those user needs:

.. collapsible::
   :heading: What are your users searching for?
   :sub_heading: Choose between returning document content or search metadata. 
   :expanded: false 

   Consider whether your application users want to return the content of documents or metadata about your documents:

   - If users want document content, 
     use the :pipeline:`$search` aggregation stage to return documents that match their search criteria. 
   - If users want metadata about their search results, 
     use the :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage to return customizable counts of matching documents and facets. 

.. collapsible::
   :heading: Which fields in your documents contain likely search terms? 
   :sub_heading: Determine which fields to index based on which fields contain the data your users want to find.
   :expanded: false 

   Identify the specific fields within your collections that users are likely to search so that you know which fields to index.
   Each |fts| query searches a single |fts| index, which contains terms that are extracted from one or more specified
   fields within a collection. When planning your |fts| queries, decide whether to index only key fields or every field in your 
   specified collection by enabling :ref:`static or dynamic mapping <static-dynamic-mappings>`. 
   You can query across multiple fields by specifying the :ref:`query path <ref-path-intro>` as an array of fields, 
   or by using the :ref:`queryString <querystring-ref>` operator.

.. collapsible::
   :heading: How closely should users' search terms match your data? 
   :sub_heading: Choose search operators based on whether your users' common search terms are exact, similar, or partial matches for your data. 
   :expanded: false 

   Your users' common search terms may be **exact**, **similar** , or **partial** matches for the data in your {+cluster+}.
   For example, users of a movie review application may want to filter for movies from an *exact* year, or see
   movie recommendations that are *similar* to their favorite film. 

   Determine the type of matches your users are searching for to inform which :ref:`operators <fts-operators>` to use in your |fts| queries: 

   - For **exact** matches, use operators like :ref:`equals <equals-ref>` or :ref:`in <in-ref>` to match documents that contain
     terms that are identical to the specified ``query`` value. You can also use the :ref:`text <text-ref>` operator to match documents
     that contain ``any`` or ``all`` of the strings in the ``query`` value. 
   - For **similar** matches, use operators like :ref:`near <near-ref>`, :ref:`moreLikeThis <more-like-this-ref>`, or :ref:`phrase <phrase-ref>` to match documents that contain
     numeric values, documents, or string orderings that are similar to the specified search terms. You can also use the :ref:`range <range-ref>` operator to match
     documents that contain a value within a specified range of values. 
   - For **partial** matches, such as search-as-you-type queries, use operators like :ref:`autocomplete <autocomplete-ref>`, :ref:`regex <regex-ref>`, or :ref:`wildcard <wildcard-ref>` to 
     implement search-as-you-type functionality or match terms using regular expressions. 
   - Use the :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operator to blend multiple matching behaviors in a single query. 

.. collapsible::
   :heading: Do you need advanced text analysis?
   :sub_heading: Use text analysis tools if your application requires text normalization, multi-language support, or more. 
   :expanded: false 

   For applications that require text normalization, multi-language support, stemming, or more, leverage 
   |fts| text analysis tools: 

   - Choose a :ref:`built-in analyzer <ref-built-in-analyzers>` in your index definition to match the language and nature of your text data. 
     Analyzers break text into terms or tokens and can adjust text to remove punctuation and capitalization, convert words to their root form,
     and more. 
   - Configure :ref:`custom analyzers <custom-analyzers>` if your application has specific requirements like handling domain-specific jargon or 
     parsing formatted text like email addresses or dash-separated IDs. 
     Custom analyzers enable you to filter text by character, 
     define the number of characters to include in each token chunk, or enable stemming or redaction.
   - Define :ref:`synonyms <synonyms-ref>` to improve search accuracy for terms with the same or similar meanings.

.. collapsible::
   :heading: How do you want to present search results?  
   :sub_heading: Use search options to implement filtering, sorting, or relevancy demands for your search results. 
   :expanded: false 

   You can adjust the presentation of search results based on your users' filtering, sorting, or 
   relevancy demands: 

   - Use the :ref:`score <scoring-ref>` query option to modify the relevance score of documents and affect the order in which 
     users view results. 
     |fts| queries associate a relevance-based score with every document in the result set, and returns documents in order from  
     the highest to the lowest score. 
   - Set the :ref:`sort <sort-ref>` query option for indexed fields that users are likely to sort in ascending or descending order,
     such as dates or numeric fields.
   - Use the :ref:`searchBefore or searchAfter <fts-paginate-results>` query options to display results as a set of pages
     that users can navigate sequentially or skip through.
   - Use the :ref:`fts-facet-ref` collector to allow users to filter results by categories or other dimensions. 
     This can significantly improve the relevance of search results, offering users a more guided search experience. 

.. collapsible::
   :heading: How can you optimize search performance?
   :sub_heading: Adjust your index and query configuration to optimize your search performance. 
   :expanded: false 

   |fts| query performance is affected by your index configuration and the complexity of your queries.
   Focus on indexing fields that are critical to your application's search functionality and aim for a
   logical balance between query complexity and speed.

   To further optimize performance, consider the following query options:

   - Use the :ref:`concurrent <concurrent-ref>` query option to set the number of concurrent
     search requests that are executed when evaluating a query. 
     This option is useful for complex queries or large datasets.
   - Use the :ref:`returnStoredSource <fts-return-stored-source-option>` query option in combination with the :ref:`storedSource <fts-stored-source-definition>` index option  
     to determine whether to return original source documents, stored as part of the index, alongside the search results. 
     This option is useful for applications where you display summaries or highlights based on search criteria.
   - Use the :ref:`numPartitions <fts-index-partition>` index option to partition your index,
     distributing index objects between sub-indexes in an optimal way. 

   For more recommendations on how to optimize your query performance, see :ref:`query-perf`. 

.. _fts-define-index: 

Define Your Index
-----------------

Before you can search your data using |fts|, you must create one or more |fts| indexes
to be used during your |fts| query. This section demonstrates how to apply your query preferences
to the |json| configuration syntax of a |fts| index.

To use the |json| syntax in this section in your index definition, replace the placeholders with valid values and 
ensure that your full index definition contains the :ref:`necessary options <index-definition-options>`.

To learn how to add your |fts| index to your cluster, see the :ref:`fts-tutorial-ref`. 

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Choose which fields to index. 

      If you know which fields you want to query in your collection,
      enable static mappings and specify the fields in your |fts| index
      definition. Otherwise, you can enable dynamic mappings to
      automatically index all fields based on a default or configured
      set of field types (``typeSet``). 
      
      To learn more, see :ref:`static-dynamic-mappings`.

      .. note::
         
         See :ref:`<ref-index-considerations>` for more details on {+fts+} indexes behaviour 
         and limitations.

               :copyable: true     

   .. step:: *(Optional)* Apply text analysis rules. 

      If you have special language, parsing, or scoring requirements for
      your ``string`` data, you can apply the following options to your
      index definition:

      .. tabs:: 
         
         .. tab:: Built-in Analyzers
            :tabid: analyzers-syntax

            To specify how |fts| breaks your text fields into tokens,
            you can set :ref:`built-in analyzers
            <ref-built-in-analyzers>` in your |fts| index.

            .. code-block:: json
               :copyable: true 
               :emphasize-lines: 2,3,10,14

               {
                 "analyzer": "<index-analyzer-name>", // top-level index analyzer, used if no analyzer is set in the field mappings
                 "searchAnalyzer": "<search-analyzer-name>", // query text analyzer, typically the same as the index analyzer
                 "mappings": {
                   "dynamic": <boolean>,
                   "fields":{
                     "<field-name>": [
                       {
                         "type": "string|autocomplete",
                         "analyzer": "<field-analyzer-name>" // field-specific index analyzer
                         "multi": {
                           "<multi-option-name>": {
                             "type": "string|autocomplete",
                             "analyzer": "<alternate-analyzer-name>" // multi-option specific index analyzer
                           }
                         }
                       }
                     ]
                   }
                 }
               }

         .. tab:: Custom Analyzers
            :tabid: custom-analyzers-syntax

            To customize how |fts| breaks text into tokens, you can
            define a :ref:`custom analyzer <custom-analyzers>` in the
            ``analyzers`` field of your |fts| index.
        
            .. code-block:: json
               :copyable: true
               :linenos: 

               {
                 "analyzers": [
                   {
                     "name": "<custom-analyzer-name>", 
                     "tokenizer": {
                       "type": "<tokenizer-type>"
                     }
                   },
                   ...
                 ]
               }

         .. tab:: Synonyms
            :tabid: synonyms-syntax 

            To run queries with the :ref:`text <text-ref>` operator that
            account for terms with the same or similar meanings, you can
            define :ref:`synonyms <synonyms-ref>` in the ``synonyms``
            field of your |fts| index. 

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/syntax/fts-index-definition-syntax-synonyms.json 
               :language: json
               :copyable: true
               :linenos:

         .. tab:: Scoring
            :tabid: scoring-syntax

            To set which similarity algorithm |fts| uses to calculate
            relevance scores during queries, specify an algorithm in the
            ``similarity.type`` property for your ``string`` fields
            indexed as the |fts| :ref:`string <bson-data-types-string>`
            or :ref:`autocomplete <bson-data-types-autocomplete>` type.

            This option determines how the :ref:`text <text-ref>`,
            :ref:`phrase <phrase-ref>`, :ref:`queryString
            <querystring-ref>`, and :ref:`autocomplete
            <more-like-this-ref>` operators calculate relevance scores.
            To learn more about the different similarity algorithms, see
            :ref:`Score Details <fts-similarity-algorithms>`.

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/syntax/fts-index-definition-syntax-similarity.json

               :copyable: true
               :linenos:

   .. step:: *(Optional)* Add options to optimize query performance. 

      If you want to optimize your query performance on a large dataset, you can add the following
      options to your index definition to limit the amount of data that your |fts| query must traverse: 

      .. tabs:: 

         .. tab:: numPartitions
            :tabid: numPartitions-syntax

            Use the :ref:`numPartitions <fts-index-partition>` option to configure partitions for your index.
            When you partition your index, |fts| automatically distributes the index objects between sub-indexes in an optimal way. 

            .. code-block:: json
               :copyable: true
               :linenos:

               {
                 "numPartitions": <integer>,
               }

         .. tab:: storedSource
            :tabid: storedSource-syntax

            Use the :ref:`storedSource <fts-stored-source-definition>` option to specify fields in the source document that |fts| must store.

            .. code-block:: json
               :copyable: true
               :linenos:

               {
                 "storedSource": true | false | {
                   "include" | "exclude": [
                     "<field-name>", 
                     ...
                   ]
                 }
               }

Define Your Query
-----------------

After you create an :ref:`{+fts+} index <ref-index-definitions>`
for all the fields that you want to search in your collection, you can run a |fts| query.
This section demonstrates how to apply your :ref:`goals for your application's search experience <fts-plan-query>` to the |json| syntax of a |fts| query. 

To use the |json| syntax in this section in your |fts| query aggregation pipeline, replace the placeholders with valid values and 
ensure that your full query pipeline contains the required :ref:`$search fields <fts-search-fields>` or :ref:`$searchMeta fields <fts-searchMeta-fields>`. 

To learn how to run a Search query, see the :ref:`fts-tutorial-ref`.

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Choose your initial |fts| pipeline stage. 

      The first stage of your |fts| query aggregation pipeline must be either the :pipeline:`$search` or :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage,
      depending on whether you're searching for documents or metadata:
      
      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 40 60

         * - Aggregation Pipeline Stage
           - Purpose
         * - :pipeline:`$search`
           - Return the search results of a full-text search.
         * - :pipeline:`$searchMeta`
           - Return metadata about your search results.

   .. step:: Apply operators to define your search criteria.

      To define your search criteria, you must apply one or more :ref:`operators <fts-operators>` or :ref:`collectors <fts-collectors>`
      to your :pipeline:`$search` or :pipeline:`$searchMeta` pipeline stage. 

      |fts| operators allow you to locate and retrieve relevant data from your {+cluster+} according to content, format, or data tyoe.
      To learn which operators support searches for each :ref:`field type <bson-data-types>`, see the table in the :ref:`operators <fts-operators>` reference section.
      You must specify one or more indexed search fields in the operator's :ref:`query path <ref-path>` parameter:

      .. tabs:: 
         
         .. tab:: $search
            :tabid: search-equals-operator

                  {
                    $search: {
                      "<operator-name>"|"<collector-name>": {
                        <operator-specification>|<collector-specification>
                      }
                    }
                  }

                  :linenos:
                  :emphasize-lines: 3-5

                  {
                    $searchMeta: {
                      "<operator-name>"|"<collector-name>": {
                        <operator-specification>|<collector-specification>
                      }
                    }
                  }

               .. output:: 
                  :visible: false

                  [ 
                    { 
                      count: { 
                        total: <results-count>
                      } 
                    } 
                  ]

      .. tip:: 
         
         You can combine multiple operators into one operation using the :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operator.
         You can also use the :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operator's *filter* clause to filter for query output that matches a given clause.

   .. step:: *(Optional)* Apply options or collectors to return metadata. 

      If you want to retrieve metadata from your |fts| query, you can apply one of the following configurations 
      to choose between the :ref:`count <count-ref>` or :ref:`fts-facet-ref` type of metadata results document: 

      .. tabs:: 
        
         .. tab:: Count Metadata
            :tabid: count-option

            To return the total or lower-bounded count of your search results, set the :ref:`count <count-ref>` option in your aggregation stage.

            The :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage returns the ``count`` metadata results, while the :pipeline:`$search` stage stores the metadata results in the 
            :ref:`$$SEARCH_META aggregation variable <fts-aggregation-variable>` and returns only the search results.
            For an example of how to retrieve the ``count`` metadata results from the ``$$SEARCH_META`` variable, see :ref:`count-results`. 

            .. code-block:: json
               :copyable: true
               :linenos:

               } 

         .. tab:: Facet Metadata
            :tabid: facet-collector

            To run a facet query, which groups results by values or ranges and returns the count for each of these groups, 
            use the :ref:`fts-facet-ref` collector in your aggregation stage.

            The :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage returns ``facet`` metadata results, while the :pipeline:`$search` stage stores the metadata results in the 
            :ref:`$$SEARCH_META aggregation variable <fts-aggregation-variable>` and returns only the search results.
            For an example of how to retrieve the ``facet`` metadata results from the ``$$SEARCH_META`` variable, see :ref:`fts-facet-results`. 

            .. code-block:: json
               :copyable: true
               :linenos:
               :emphasize-lines: 3-7

               {
                 "$search" | "$searchMeta": {
                   "facet": {
                     "facets": {
                       <facet-definitions>
                     }
                   }
                 }
               }

   .. step:: *(Optional)* Add search options to your $search stage to retrieve additional information about your |fts| query.

      You can retrieve additional information about your :pipeline:`$search` stage results using the following options: 

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 30 70
         :header-rows: 1
              
         * - Option
           - Use Case

         * - :ref:`highlight <highlight-ref>`
           - Display your search terms in their original
             context as fields in your query result.
                
         * - :ref:`scoreDetail <fts-score-details>`
           -  Retrieve a detailed breakdown of the score for each document |fts| returns.
          
         * - :ref:`tracking <fts-tracking-ref>`
           - Track and provide analytics information for your query search terms.

         * - :ref:`explain <explain-ref>`
           - Retrieve analytics about which Lucene queries |fts| executed to
             satify your query, and how much time your query
             spends in the various stages of execution.
                            
   .. step:: *(Optional)* Add $search options to define result ranking. 

      You can implement special ordering functionality for your :pipeline:`$search` results with the following options: 

      .. list-table::
          :widths: 30 70
          :header-rows: 1
              
          * - Option
            - Use Case
         
          * - :ref:`score <scoring-ref>`
            - Modify the relevance score of the documents in the results to ensure |fts| returns relevant results.

          * - :ref:`sort <sort-ref>`
            - Sort your results by number, string, and date fields, or by score.

          * - :ref:`searchBefore/searchAfter <fts-paginate-results>`
            - Set a reference point to stop or start your ordered results
   
   .. step:: *(Optional)* Add $search options to optimize query performance.

      Optimize query performance using the following :pipeline:`$search` options: 

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 30 70
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Option
           - Use Case
  
         * - :ref:`returnStoredSource <fts-return-stored-source-option>`
           - Run your |fts| query more efficiently by only
             retrieving fields stored on ``mongot`` as
             specified in your |fts| index definition for a
             collection.

         * - :ref:`concurrent <concurrent-ref>`
           - Parallelize search across segments on :ref:`dedicated search
             nodes <what-is-search-node>`.
