Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: geoNear

   Specifies a point for which a
   geospatial query returns the 100 closest documents.
   The :dbcommand:`geoNear` command provides an alternative to the
   :operator:`$near` operator. In addition to the functionality of
   :operator:`$near`, :dbcommand:`geoNear` returns additional diagnostic
   information.

   The :dbcommand:`geoNear` command can use either a :term:`GeoJSON`
   point or :term:`legacy coordinate pairs`.

   The :dbcommand:`geoNear` command provides the fields described in the
   following table, except where noted. The table applies to both the
   :dbcommand:`geoNear` command and the :pipeline:`$geoNear` operator
   and indicates where behavior varies between the two. Specify all
   distances in the same units as the document coordinate system:

   To query a :doc:`2dsphere </core/2dsphere>` index, use the
