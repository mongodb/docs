==================
mongo.setSlaveOk()
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: Mongo.setSlaveOk()

   For the current session, this command permits read operations from
   non-master (i.e. :term:`slave` or :term:`secondary`)
   instances. Practically, use this method in the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getMongo().setSlaveOk()

   Indicates that ":term:`eventually consistent <eventual
   consistency>`" read operations are acceptable for the current
   application. This function provides the same functionality as
   :method:`rs.slaveOk()`.

   See the :method:`readPref() <cursor.readPref()>` method for more
   fine-grained control over :doc:`read preference
   </core/read-preference>` in the :program:`mongo` shell.
