Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to
perform **bulk operations**. Bulk operations help reduce the number
of calls to the server. Instead of sending a request for each operation,
you can perform multiple operations within one action.

.. tip::

   To learn more about bulk operations, see :manual:`Bulk Write Operations </core/bulk-write-operations/>`
   in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`node-bulk-insert-operation` describes how to perform bulk insert
  operations on your collection or client.
- :ref:`node-bulk-replace-operation` describes how to perform bulk replace
  operations on your collection or client.
- :ref:`node-bulk-update-operation` describes how to perform bulk update
  operations on your collection or client.
- :ref:`node-bulk-delete-operation` describes how to perform bulk delete
  operations on your collection or client.
- :ref:`node-bulk-return-type` describes the return object that results from your
  bulk write operations.
- :ref:`node-bulk-handle-exceptions` describes the exceptions that occur if 
  any of the operations in a bulk write operation fail.
- :ref:`node-bulk-addtl-info` provides links to resources and API documentation for
  types and methods mentioned in this guide.

.. important:: Server and Driver Version Requirements

   Collection-level bulk write operations require the following versions:

   - {+mdb-server+} version 3.2 or later
   - {+driver-short+} version 3.6 or later

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``movies`` and ``users`` collections in
the ``sample_mflix`` database, which is included in the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`.
To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

.. _node-bulk-insert-operation:

Bulk Insert Operations
----------------------

To perform a bulk insert operation, create a bulk operation model for each document
you want to insert. Then, pass a list of these models to the ``bulkWrite()``
method.

.. _node-bulk-insert-collection:

Collection Bulk Inserts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a bulk insert operation on your collection, create an ``InsertOneModel``
for each operation. Then, call the ``bulkWrite()`` method on your collection
and pass an array of models as a parameter. To create an ``InsertOneModel``, 
specify the model's ``document`` field and set it to the document you want to insert.

Example
```````

This example performs the following actions:

1. Specifies two ``InsertOneModel`` instances in an array. Each ``InsertOneModel`` 
   represents a document to insert into the ``movies`` collection in the
   ``sample_mflix`` database. 
#. Calls the ``bulkWrite()`` method on the ``movies`` collection and passes an
   array of models as a parameter.
#. Prints the number of inserted documents.

      Inserted documents: 2

.. _node-bulk-replace-operation:

Bulk Replace Operations
-----------------------

To perform a bulk replace operation, create a bulk operation model for each document
you want to replace. Then, pass a list of these models to the ``bulkWrite()``
method.

.. _node-bulk-replace-collection:

Collection Bulk Replacements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a bulk replace operation on your collection, create a ``ReplaceOneModel``
for each operation. Then, call the ``bulkWrite()`` method on your collection
and pass an array of models as a parameter. 

The following table describes the fields that you can set in a
``ReplaceOneModel``:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``filter`` 
     - | The filter that matches the document you want to replace.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``replacement`` 
     - | The replacement document.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``collation`` 
     - | (Optional) The collation to use when sorting results. To learn more 
         about collations, see the :ref:`node-fundamentals-collations` guide.
       | Type: ``String`` or ``Object``

   * - ``hint`` 
     - | (Optional) The index to use for the operation. To learn more about
         indexes, see the :ref:`node-fundamentals-indexes` guide.
       | Type: ``Bson``

   * - ``upsert`` 
     - | (Optional) Whether a new document is created if no document matches the filter.
       | By default, this field is set to ``false``.
       | Type: ``Boolean``

Example
```````

This example performs the following actions:

1. Specifies two ``ReplaceOneModel`` instances in an array. The ``ReplaceOneModel`` 
   instances contain instructions to replace documents representing movies in the
   ``movies`` collection.
#. Calls the ``bulkWrite()`` method on the ``movies`` collection and passes an
   array of models as a parameter.
#. Prints the number of modified documents.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /code-snippets/crud/bulk.js
      :start-after: begin-replace-coll
      :end-before: end-replace-coll
      :language: javascript
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

.. _node-bulk-update-operation:

Bulk Update Operations
----------------------

To perform a bulk update operation, create a bulk operation model for each update
you want to make. Then, pass a list of these models to the ``bulkWrite()``
method.

.. _node-bulk-update-collection:

Collection Bulk Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a bulk update operation on your collection, create an ``UpdateOneModel``
or ``UpdateManyModel`` for each operation. Then, call the ``bulkWrite()`` method on
your collection and pass an array of models as a parameter. An ``UpdateOneModel``
updates only one document that matches a filter, while an ``UpdateManyModel`` updates
all documents that match a filter.

The following table describes the fields you can set in an ``UpdateOneModel`` or 
``UpdateManyModel``:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``filter`` 
     - | The filter that matches one or more documents you want to update. When 
         specified in an ``UpdateOneModel``, only the first matching document will 
         be updated. When specified in an ``UpdateManyModel``, all matching documents
         will be updated.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``update`` 
     - | The update to perform.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``arrayFilters`` 
     - | (Optional) A set of filters specifying which array elements an update 
         applies to if you are updating an array-valued field.
       | Type: ``Array``

   * - ``collation`` 
     - | (Optional) The collation to use when sorting results. To learn more about 
         collations, see the :ref:`node-fundamentals-collations` guide.
       | Type: ``Object``

   * - ``hint`` 
     - | (Optional) The index to use for the operation. To learn more about
         indexes, see the :ref:`node-fundamentals-indexes` guide.
       | Type: ``String or Object``

   * - ``upsert`` 
     - | (Optional) Whether a new document is created if no document matches the filter.
         By default, this field is set to ``false``.
       | Type: ``Boolean``

Example
```````

This example performs the following actions:

1. Specifies an ``UpdateOneModel`` and an ``UpdateManyModel`` instance in an array. 
   These models contain instructions to update documents representing movies in the
   ``movies`` collection.
#. Calls the ``bulkWrite()`` method on the ``movies`` collection and passes an
   array of models as a parameter.
#. Prints the number of modified documents.

.. _node-bulk-delete-operation:

Bulk Delete Operations
----------------------

To perform a bulk delete operation, create a bulk operation model for each delete
operation. Then, pass a list of these models to the ``bulkWrite()`` method.

.. _node-bulk-delete-collection:

Collection Bulk Deletes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a bulk delete operation on your collection, create a ``DeleteOneModel``
or ``DeleteManyModel`` for each operation. Then, call the ``bulkWrite()`` method on
your collection and pass an array of models as a parameter.  A ``DeleteOneModel``
deletes only one document that matches a filter, while a ``DeleteManyModel`` deletes
all documents that match a filter.

The following table describes the fields you can set in a ``DeleteOneModel`` or 
``DeleteManyModel``:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``filter`` 
     - | The filter that matches one or more documents you want to delete. When 
         specified in a ``DeleteOneModel``, only the first matching document will
         be deleted. When specified in a ``DeleteManyModel``, all matching documents
         will be deleted.
       | Type: ``Document``

   * - ``collation`` 
     - | (Optional) The collation to use when sorting results. To learn more about 
         collations, see the :ref:`node-fundamentals-collations` guide.
       | Type: ``Object``

   * - ``hint`` 
     - | (Optional) The index to use for the operation. To learn more about
         indexes, see the :ref:`node-fundamentals-indexes` guide.
       | Type: ``String or Object``

Example
```````

This example performs the following actions:

1. Specifies a ``DeleteOneModel`` and a ``DeleteManyModel`` instance in an array. 
   These models contain instructions to delete documents in the
   ``movies`` collection.
#. Calls the ``bulkWrite()`` method on the ``movies`` collection and passes an
   array of models as a parameter.
#. Prints the number of deleted documents.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /code-snippets/crud/bulk.js
      :start-after: begin-delete-coll
      :end-before: end-delete-coll
      :language: javascript
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Deleted documents: 5538

.. _node-bulk-return-type:

Return Type
-----------

The ``Collection.bulkWrite()`` method returns a ``BulkWriteResult`` object, which provides
information about your bulk operation.

The following tables describes the fields of a ``BulkWriteResult`` object:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``insertedCount`` 
     - The number of inserted documents

     - The number of matched documents

   * - ``modifiedCount`` 
     - The number of updated documents

   * - ``upsertedCount`` 
     - The number of upserted documents

   * - ``deletedCount`` 
     - The number of deleted documents

.. _node-bulk-handle-exceptions:

Handling Exceptions
-------------------

If any bulk write operations called on a collection are unsuccessful,
the {+driver-short+} throws a ``MongoBulkWriteError`` and does not perform any further operations if the 
``ordered`` option is set to ``true``. If ``ordered`` is set to ``false``, it will
attempt to continue with subsequent operations.

.. tip::

   To learn more about ordered and unordered bulk operations, see
   the :manual:`Ordered vs Unordered Operations </core/bulk-write-operations/#ordered-vs-unordered-operations>`
   section in the Bulk Write guide from the {+mdb-server+} manual.

A ``MongoBulkWriteError`` object contains the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``message`` 
     - | The error message. 
       | Type: ``String``

   * - ``writeErrors`` 
     - | An array of errors that occurred during the bulk write operation.
       | Type: ``BulkWriteError[]``

   * - ``writeConcernErrors`` 
     - | Write concern errors that occurred during execution of the bulk write operation.
       | Type: ``WriteConnectionError[]``   

   * - ``result`` 
     - | The results of any successful operations performed before the exception was 
         thrown.
       | Type: ``BulkWriteResult[]``   

   * - ``err`` 
     - | The underlying error object, which may contain more details.
       | Type: ``Error``
