.. dbcommand:: abortReshardCollection

   .. versionadded:: 5.0

   During a :ref:`resharding operation <sharding-resharding>`, you can
   abort the operation with the :dbcommand:`abortReshardCollection`
   command.

   The command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        abortReshardCollection: "<database>.<collection>"
      }

   You can abort a :ref:`resharding operation <sharding-resharding>` at
   any point until the :ref:`commit phase
   <resharding-commit-phase-command>`. If the :ref:`resharding operation
   <sharding-resharding>` has reached the :ref:`commit phase
   <resharding-commit-phase-command>` before you run the
   :dbcommand:`abortReshardCollection` command, the command returns an
   error.

   The :binary:`~bin.mongosh` provides a wrapper method
   :method:`sh.abortReshardCollection()`.
