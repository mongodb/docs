Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about using **indexes** to improve the
efficiency of your queries and add functionality to querying and
storing documents.

Without a relevant index, MongoDB scans every document in a collection
to find the documents that match a query. These collection scans are
slow and can negatively affect the performance of your application.
However, if the appropriate index exists, MongoDB can use the index to
reduce the number of documents to inspect.

Operational Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often in
your application's queries or operations that return sorted results. Each
index that you add consumes disk space and memory, so we recommend
that you track memory and disk usage when doing capacity planning. In addition,
when a write operation updates an indexed field, MongoDB updates the related
index, which can negatively impact performance for write operations.

You can use :manual:`wildcard indexes </core/index-wildcard/>` in your
MongoDB application to query against fields whose names are not known in
advance or are arbitrary. Wildcard indexes are *not* designed to replace
workload-based index planning.

To learn more about designing your data model and choosing
indexes, see the :manual:`Indexes
</core/data-model-operations/#indexes>` section of the Operational
Factors and Data Models guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``movies`` collection in the
``sample_mflix`` database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets
</sample-data>`. To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and
load the sample datasets, see the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas
</getting-started>` guide.

Create an Index
---------------

MongoDB supports several index types to help query your data.
The following pages describe different index types and provide sample
code to programmatically create each type of index.

- :ref:`php-single-field-index`
- :ref:`php-compound-index`
- :ref:`php-multikey-index`
- :ref:`php-atlas-search-index`

List Indexes
------------

You can retrieve a list of indexes on a collection by calling the
``MongoDB\Collection::listIndexes()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.php
   :language: php
   :start-after: start-list-indexes
   :end-before: end-list-indexes
   :dedent:

.. _php-remove-idx:

Remove an Index
---------------

You can remove any unused index except the default unique index on the
``_id`` field.

The following sections provide examples that show how to remove one or
more indexes from a collection.

Delete a Single Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pass the name of an index to the ``MongoDB\Collection::dropIndex()``
method to remove an index from a collection.

The following example removes the ``'_title_'`` index from the
``movies`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.php
   :language: php
   :start-after: start-remove-index
   :end-before: end-remove-index
   :dedent:

.. note::

   You cannot remove a single field from a compound index. You must
   drop the entire index and create a new one to update the indexed
   fields.

Delete All Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete all indexes by calling the
``MongoDB\Collection::dropIndexes()`` method on a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/indexes/indexes.php
   :language: php
   :start-after: start-remove-all-indexes
   :end-before: end-remove-all-indexes
   :dedent:

The ``dropIndexes()`` method returns information about the number of
indexes removed and a success message.
