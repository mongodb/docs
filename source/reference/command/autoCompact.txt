.. dbcommand:: autoCompact

   .. versionadded:: 8.0

   Enables or disables background :ref:`compaction <compact>`. 
   When enabled, ``autoCompact`` periodically iterates through all available 
   files and continuously runs compaction if there is enough free storage space 
   available. 

   Before you enable ``autoCompact``, run the :dbcommand:`dbStats` command to 
   see if you have enough available storage space for compaction to proceed. If 
   the amount of available space returned by ``dbStats`` is less than 
   ``freeSpaceTargetMB``, background compaction has no effect.

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      { 
        autoCompact: <boolean>, 
        freeSpaceTargetMB: <int>, // Optional 
        runOnce: <boolean>, // Optional
      }
   )

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-no-free.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Command Fields
--------------

The command can take the following optional fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``freeSpaceTargetMB`` 
     - Integer 
     - .. versionadded: 7.3

       .. include:: /includes/fact-freeSpaceTargetMB.rst

       *Default:* 20

   * - ``runOnce``
     - boolean
     - Optional. If ``runOnce`` is set to ``true``, background compaction runs 
       only once through every collection on the node.

       If ``runOnce`` is set to ``false``, background compaction runs 
       continuously on all collections in the database. If a collection fails to
       compact while ``runOnce`` is ``false``, MongoDB temporarily skips that 
       collection and continues compacting the remaining collections. MongoDB 
       attempts to compact the failed collection again after approximately one 
       day. 

.. warning:: 

   Always have an up-to-date backup before performing server
   maintenance such as the ``autoCompact`` operation.

Required Privileges
-------------------

For clusters enforcing :ref:`authentication <authentication>`,
you must authenticate as a user with the :authaction:`compact` privilege
action on the target collection. The :authrole:`dbAdmin` and 
:authrole:`hostManager` roles provide the required privileges for running 
``autoCompact`` against all collections. 

Behavior
--------

Blocking
~~~~~~~~

Although the ``autoCompact`` command itself doesn't block any reads and 
writes, background compaction applies the same :ref:`blocking behavior 
<compact-blocking>` as the :dbcommand:`compact` command.

Excluded Collections 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an :term:`oplog` exists, MongoDB excludes it from background compaction.

Performance Considerations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend running ``autoCompact`` during periods of low traffic. If you run 
background compaction in parallel with other operations, it can negatively 
impact performance.

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run background compaction on collections and indexes that are 
stored in a replica set. However, note the following considerations:  

- The primary node does not replicate the ``autoCompact`` command to the
  secondary nodes.
- A secondary node can replicate data while background compaction is 
  running.
- Reads and writes are permitted while background compaction is running.

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``autoCompact`` only applies to :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. In a
sharded environment, run ``autoCompact`` on each shard separately.

You cannot run ``autoCompact`` against a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.
