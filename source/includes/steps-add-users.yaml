     * - Field

       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`User Name`

       - The user's login name. All MongoDB users for |service| are
         associated with the ``admin`` database; i.e. their
         :ref:`authentication database <user-authentication-database>`
         is ``admin``. To access MongoDB, a user provides a username
         and the name of the authentication database, as well as a
         password. The authentication database does not determine the
         user's roles. You can assign a user different roles in
         different database namespaces.

         .. example::

            You can create a user to have the ``readWrite`` role on
            the ``test`` database but only the ``read`` role on the
            ``production`` database. The authentication database would
            still be ``admin``.

     * - :guilabel:`Password`

       - The user's password.

         |service| clusters use :ref:`SCRAM
         <authentication-scram>` to authenticate MongoDB users.

     * - :guilabel:`User Privileges`

       - You can assign roles in one of the following ways:

         - Select :atlasrole:`Atlas admin`, which provides the user
           with privileges to administer the |service| project's
           clusters.

         - Select :atlasrole:`Read and write to any database`, which
           provides the user with privileges to read and write to any
           database.

         - Select :atlasrole:`Only read any database` which provides
           the user with privileges to read any database.

         - Select :guilabel:`Select Custom Role`, which allows you to
           select a custom MongoDB role previously created in
           |service|. For more information on custom MongoDB roles, see
           :ref:`mongodb-roles`.

         - Click :guilabel:`Add Default Privileges`. When you
           click this option, you can select
           individual roles and specify the database on which the
           roles apply. Optionally, for the ``read`` and ``readWrite``
           roles, you can also specify a collection. If you do not
           specify a collection for ``read`` and ``readWrite``, the
           role applies to all non-``system`` collections in the
           database.

           .. note::

              .. include:: /includes/fact-read-read-write-actions.rst

           .. tip::

              You can create custom MongoDB roles in |service| in
              cases where the built-in |service| roles cannot
              describe the desired set of priveleges. For more
              information on custom roles, see :ref:`mongodb-roles`.

         For information on the built-in |service| privileges, see
         :ref:`atlas-user-privileges`.

         For more information on authorization, see :manual:`Role-Based
         Access Control </core/authorization>` and :manual:`Built-in
         Roles </core/security-built-in-roles>` in the MongoDB manual.

     * - :guilabel:`Save as temporary user`

       - Check this option to specify a time after which |service| will
         delete the user. You can select one of the following time
         periods for the user to exist:

         - 6 hours

         - 1 day

         - 1 week

         In the :guilabel:`MongoDB Users` tab, temporary users display
         the time remaining until |service| will delete the user. Once
         |service| deletes the user, any client or application
         attempting to authenticate with the user loses access to
         the database.
