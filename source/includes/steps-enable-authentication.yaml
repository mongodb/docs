title: "Select the :guilabel:`Agent Auth Mechanism` and configure the |mms| Agents."
replacement:
  mechanism: "the authentication mechanism"
pre: |
  If you enable more than one authenication mechanism, you must specify
  which authentication mechanism the |mms| agents should use to
  connect to your deployment. Choose {{mechanism}}.
content: |
  |mms| automatically generates the Agents' usernames and passwords.
  
  |mms| creates users for the agents with the
  required user roles in the admin database for each existing deployment
  in |mms|. When you add a new deployment, |mms| creates the required
  users in the new deployment.
post: |
  You do not need to configure all of the agents: for
  example, if you are not using Backup, you do not need to configure
  the Backup agent.
