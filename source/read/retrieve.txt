Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to retrieve
data from a MongoDB collection by using **read operations**. You can call the
``find()`` or ``find_one()`` method on a collection to retrieve documents
that match a set of criteria.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``companies`` collection in the ``sample_training``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your C++ application, instantiate a ``mongocxx::client`` that connects to an Atlas
cluster and assign the following values to your ``db`` and ``collection`` variables:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/retrieve.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-db-coll
    :end-before: end-db-coll

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Find Documents
--------------

The {+driver-short+} includes two methods for retrieving documents from a collection:
``find_one()`` and ``find()``.
These methods take a **query filter** and return one or more matching documents.
A query filter is an object that specifies the documents you want to retrieve in
your query. 

.. TODO:
 To learn more about query filters, see :ref:`cpp-specify-query`.

.. _cpp-retrieve-find-one:

Find One Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find a single document in a collection, call the ``find_one()`` method and pass a query
filter that specifies the criteria of the document you want to find.

The ``find_one()`` method returns an instance of ``std::optional< bsoncxx::document::value >``.
If the query filter matches a document, the ``optional`` object contains a value of type
``bsoncxx::document::value``. If the query filter does not match any documents, the ``optional``
object contains no value.

If the query filter matches more than one document, the ``find_one()`` method returns the *first*
matching document from the retrieved results.

.. tip::
   
   The ``find_one()`` method is useful when you know there's only one matching document
   or if you're only interested in the first match.  

The following example uses the ``find_one()`` method to find the first document in which
the ``name`` field has the value ``"LinkedIn"``:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/read/retrieve.cpp
      :start-after: start-find-one
      :end-before: end-find-one
      :language: cpp
      :dedent:

   .. output::

      { "_id" : { "$oid" : "52cdef7c4bab8bd675297e0c" }, "name" : "LinkedIn", "permalink" : "linkedin",
      "crunchbase_url" : "http://www.crunchbase.com/company/linkedin", "homepage_url" : "http://linkedin.com",
      ...
   
.. tip:: Sort Order

   The ``find_one()`` method returns the first document in 
   :manual:`natural order </reference/glossary/#std-term-natural-order>`
   on disk if no sort criteria is specified.

.. TODO:
 To learn more about sorting, see the :ref:`sort guide <cpp-sort>`.

.. _cpp-retrieve-find-multiple:

Find Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find multiple documents in a collection, pass a query filter to the ``find()``
method that specifies the criteria of the documents you want to retrieve. 

The following example uses the ``find()`` method to find all documents in which
the ``founded_year`` field has the value ``1970``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/retrieve.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-find-many
    :end-before: end-find-many

The ``find()`` method returns an instance of ``mongocxx::cursor``, which you can
iterate over to see the matching documents. A cursor is a mechanism that allows an
application to iterate over database results while holding only a subset of them in
memory at a given time. Cursors are useful when your ``find()`` method returns a large
amount of documents.

You can iterate over the documents in a cursor by using a ``for-in`` loop, as shown in
the following example:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/read/retrieve.cpp
      :start-after: start-cursor
      :end-before: end-cursor
      :language: cpp
      :dedent:

   .. output::

      { "_id" : { "$oid" : "52cdef7d4bab8bd675298be4" }, "name" : "Mitsubishi Motors",
      "permalink" : "mitsubishi-motors", "crunchbase_url" : "http://www.crunchbase.com/company/mitsubishi-motors",
      ...

      { "_id" : { "$oid" : "52cdef7e4bab8bd67529b996" }, "name" : "Western Digital",
      "permalink" : "western-digital", "crunchbase_url" : "http://www.crunchbase.com/company/western-digital",
      ...

      { "_id" : { "$oid" : "52cdef7e4bab8bd67529b9f1" }, "name" : "Celarayn", "permalink" : "celarayn",
      "crunchbase_url" : "http://www.crunchbase.com/company/celarayn",
      ...

.. note:: Find All Documents

   To find all documents in a collection, pass an empty filter 
   to the ``find()`` method:

   .. code-block:: cpp

      auto cursor = collection.find({})

Modify Find Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``find()`` and ``find_one()`` methods by passing
an instance of the ``mongocxx::options::find`` class as a parameter. The following table
describes some of the fields you can set in a ``mongocxx::options::find`` instance:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``batch_size`` 
     - | The number of documents to return per batch.
       | **Type**: ``std::int32_t``

   * - ``collation`` 
     - | The collation to use for the operation.
       | **Type**: ``bsoncxx::document::view_or_value``

   * - ``comment`` 
     - | The comment to attach to the operation.
       | **Type**: ``bsoncxx::string::view_or_value``

   * - ``cursor_type`` 
     - | The type of cursor to use for the operation.
       | **Type**: ``cursor::type``

   * - ``limit`` 
     - | The maximum number of documents the operation can return.
       | **Type**: ``std::int64_t``

   * - ``skip`` 
     - | The number of documents to skip before returning results.
       | **Type**: ``std::int64_t``

   * - ``sort`` 
     - | The order in which the operation returns matching documents.
       | **Type**: ``bsoncxx::document::view_or_value``

The following example uses the ``find()`` method to find all documents in which
the ``number_of_employees`` field has the value ``1000`` and instructs the
operation to return a maximum of ``5`` results:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/retrieve.cpp
    :language: cpp
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-modify
    :end-before: end-modify
