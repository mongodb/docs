Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use bulk operations in the
{+driver-long+}.

For individual CRUD operations, you can use the relevant method. For
example, to insert one document and then update multiple documents, you
can use the ``insertOne()`` method and the ``updateMany()`` method.

The ``MongoClient`` performs these operations by making a request to the
database corresponding to each operation. You can reduce the number of
calls to the database by using bulk operations.

Performing Bulk Operations
--------------------------

Bulk operations consist of a large number of write operations. To perform
a bulk operation, pass a ``List`` containing ``WriteModel`` documents to the
``bulkWrite()`` method. A ``WriteModel`` is a model that represents a single
write operation.

The following sections show how to create and use each variation of the ``WriteModel``
type. The examples in each section use the following documents in the ``people`` collection:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": 1, "name": "Karen Sandoval", "age": 31 }
   { "_id": 2, "name": "William Chin", "age": 54 }
   { "_id": 8, "name": "Shayla Ray", "age": 20 }

This data is modeled with the following Kotlin data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.bulk-data-model.kt
   :language: kotlin

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `bulkWrite() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-kotlin-coroutine/mongodb-driver-kotlin-coroutine/com.mongodb.kotlin.client.coroutine/-mongo-collection/bulk-write.html>`__
- `WriteModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/WriteModel.html>`__
- `BulkWriteOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/BulkWriteOptions.html>`__

Insert Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an insert operation, create an ``InsertOneModel`` specifying
the document you want to insert. To insert multiple documents, you must
create an ``InsertOneModel`` for each document you want to insert.

Example
```````

The following example creates an ``InsertOneModel`` for two documents
describing people:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.insert-one.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()`` operation, the ``InsertOneModel`` cannot
   insert a document with an ``_id`` that already exists in the
   collection. In this case, the driver throws a ``MongoBulkWriteException``.

   The following example tries to insert two documents where the ``_id``
   values are ``1`` and ``3``. Since there is already a document with an ``_id``
   of ``1`` in the collection, the operation results in an error:
   
   .. io-code-block::

      .. input:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.bulk-write-exception.kt
         :language:  kotlin

      .. output:: 
         :language:  console
         
         A MongoBulkWriteException occurred with the following message:  
         Bulk write operation error on server sample-shard-00-02.pw0q4.mongodb.net:27017. 
         Write errors: [BulkWriteError{index=0, code=11000, message='E11000 duplicate key 
         error collection: crudOps.bulkWrite index: _id_ dup key: { _id: 1 }', details={}}].

   To learn about why the driver didn't insert the document with the
   ``_id`` of ``3``, see the :ref:`Order of Execution <orderOfExecution>` section.

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the `InsertOneModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/InsertOneModel.html>`__ API documentation. 

Replace Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a replace operation, create a ``ReplaceOneModel`` specifying
a query filter for the document you want to replace and the replacement
document.

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``ReplaceOneModel`` cannot
   make changes that violate unique index constraints on
   the collection. Additionally, the model does not perform the replace
   operation if there are no matches to the query filter.

Example
```````

The following example creates a ``ReplaceOneModel`` to
replace a document where the ``_id`` is ``1`` with a document that
contains the additional ``location`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.replace-one.kt
   :language: kotlin

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
the ``ReplaceOneModel`` instance, the operation replaces the first
result. You can specify a sort in a ``ReplaceOptions`` instance to apply
an order to matched documents before the driver performs the replace
operation, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.replace-model-options.kt
   :language: kotlin

- `ReplaceOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/ReplaceOptions.html>`__ API documentation
- :manual:`Unique indexes </core/index-unique/>` Server Manual Explanation

Update Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an update operation, create an ``UpdateOneModel`` or an
``UpdateManyModel`` that specifies a query filter and an update document.

The ``UpdateOneModel`` updates the first document that matches your query
filter and the ``UpdateManyModel`` updates all the documents that
match your query filter.

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``UpdateOneModel`` and
   ``UpdateManyModel`` types cannot make changes that violate unique
   index constraints on the collection. Additionally, the models do not
   perform update operations if there are no matches to the query
   filter.

Example
```````

The following example creates an ``UpdateOneModel`` to increment the ``age``
field by ``1`` in a document where the ``_id`` is ``2``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.update-one.kt
   :language: java

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
the ``UpdateOneModel`` instance, the operation updates the first
result. You can specify a sort in an ``UpdateOptions`` instance to apply
an order to matched documents before the driver performs the update
operation, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.update-model-options.kt
   :language: kotlin

- `UpdateOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/UpdateOptions.html>`__ API documentation
- :manual:`unique indexes </core/index-unique/>` Server Manual Explanation

Delete Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a delete operation, create a ``DeleteOneModel`` or a
``DeleteManyModel`` that specifies a query filter for documents you want
to delete.

The ``DeleteOneModel`` deletes the first document that matches your query
filter and the ``DeleteManyModel`` deletes all the documents that
match your query filter.

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``DeleteOneModel`` and
   ``DeleteManyModel`` types do not delete any documents if there are no
   matches to the query filter.

Example
```````

The following example creates a ``DeleteOneModel`` to delete
a document where the ``_id`` is ``1`` and a ``DeleteManyModel`` to delete
documents where the ``age`` value is less than ``30``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.delete.kt
   :language: kotlin

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `DeleteOneModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/DeleteOneModel.html>`__
- `DeleteManyModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/DeleteManyModel.html>`__

.. _orderOfExecution:

Order of Execution
------------------

The ``bulkWrite()`` method accepts an optional ``BulkWriteOptions`` as
a second parameter to specify if you want to execute the bulk operations
as ordered or unordered.

Ordered Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the ``bulkWrite()`` method executes bulk operations in
order. This means that the operations execute in the order you
added them to the list until any error occurs.

Example 
```````

The following example performs these bulk operations:

- An insert operation for a document where the ``name`` is
  ``"Zaynab Omar"`` and  the ``age`` is ``37``
- A replace operation for a document where the ``_id`` is ``1`` with a new
  document that contains the ``location`` field
- An update operation for a document where the ``_id`` is ``6`` to
  change the ``name`` field
- A delete operation for all documents that have an ``age`` value
  greater than ``50``

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.ordered.kt
   :language: kotlin

After running this example, your collection contains the following 
document:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   
   { "_id": 1, "name": "Sandy Kane", "location": "Helena, MT" }
   { "_id": 8, "name": "Shayla Ray", "age": 20 }
   { "_id": 6, "name": "Zaynab Hassan", "age": 37 }

Unordered Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also execute bulk operations in any order by passing ``false``
to the ``ordered()`` method on a ``BulkWriteOptions`` object. This means that
all the write operations execute regardless of errors. If any errors occur,
the driver reports them at the end.

The following code shows how to execute a bulk operation with no order
of execution:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.unordered.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. note::

   Unordered bulk operations do not guarantee the order of execution. The
   order may differ from the way you list them to optimize the runtime.
   
   In the preceding example, if the ``bulkWrite()`` method performed the
   insert operation after the update operation, the update operation
   would not produce changes because the document did not exist
   at that point in time. The collection would then contain the following
   documents:
   
   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false
   
      { "_id": 1, "name": "Sandy Kane", "location": "Helena, MT" }
      { "_id": 8, "name": "Shayla Ray", "age": 20 }
      { "_id": 6, "name": "Zaynab Omar", "age": 37 }

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `BulkWriteOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/BulkWriteOptions.html>`__
- `ordered() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/BulkWriteOptions.html#ordered(boolean)>`__

Summary
-------

To perform a bulk operation, create and pass a list of
``WriteModel`` documents to the ``bulkWrite()`` method.

There are six variations of ``WriteModel``:

- ``InsertOneModel``
- ``ReplaceOneModel``
- ``UpdateOneModel``
- ``UpdateManyModel``
- ``DeleteOneModel``
- ``DeleteManyModel``

There are two ways to execute the ``bulkWrite()`` method:

- Ordered, where the driver performs the write operations in order until any error occurs
- Unordered, where the driver performs all the write operations in any order and
  reports any errors after the operations complete
