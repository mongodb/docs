MongoDB provides a number of :doc:`built-in roles
</reference/built-in-roles>`. However, if these roles cannot describe the
desired set of privileges, you can create new roles.

.. note::

   You can configure custom database roles in the UI for deployments
   hosted in {+atlas+}. To learn more, see 
   :atlas:`Configure Custom Database Roles 
   </security-add-mongodb-roles>`.

Role Management Interface
-------------------------

To add a role, MongoDB provides the :method:`db.createRole()` method.
MongoDB also provides methods to update existing user-defined roles. For
a full list of role management methods, see
:ref:`role-management-methods`.

Scope
-----

When adding a role, you create the role in a specific database. MongoDB
uses the combination of the database and the role name to uniquely
define a role.

Centralized Role Data
---------------------

MongoDB stores all role information in the :doc:`system.roles
</reference/system-roles-collection>` collection in the ``admin`` database

Do not access this collection directly but instead use the :ref:`role
management commands <role-management-commands>` to view and edit custom roles.
