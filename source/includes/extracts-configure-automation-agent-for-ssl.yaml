     |onprem| can manage |tls-ssl| for you if you using Automation for
     the deployment. With Automation, |mms| prompts you for the
     certificates to use to connect to the deployment when you enable
     |tls-ssl| and then configures the agents appropriately. See:
     :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment` for more information.

  To ensure that the Automation Agents use |tls-ssl| when connecting to
  |onprem|, Configure |onprem| to use |tls-ssl| for all connections.
  The :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-connection-to-web-interface`
  tutorial describes how to set up |onprem| to run over HTTPS.

  By default, the Automation Agent validates the |tls-ssl| certificate
  of the |onprem|.

  If you are not using a certificate signed by a trusted 3rd party, you
  must configure the Automation Agent to trust |onprem|.

  To specify a self-signed certificate for |onprem| that the Automation
  Agent should trust:
