You can create teams at the organization level and add teams to 
projects to grant project access roles to multiple users. Add any 
number of organization users to a team.

Grant a team roles for specific projects. All members of a team share 
the same project access. Organization users can belong to multiple 
teams. To add teams to a project or edit team roles, see 
:ref:`manage-project-access`.
