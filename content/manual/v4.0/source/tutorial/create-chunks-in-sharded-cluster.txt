In most situations a :term:`sharded cluster` will create/split and
distribute chunks automatically without user intervention. However, in
a limited number of cases, MongoDB cannot create enough chunks or
distribute data fast enough to support the required throughput.

For example, if you want to ingest a large volume of data into a
cluster that is unbalanced, or where the ingestion of data will lead to
data imbalance, such as with monotonically increasing or decreasing
shard keys. Pre-splitting the chunks of an empty sharded collection
can help with the throughput in these cases.

Alternatively, starting in MongoDB 4.0.3, by defining the :doc:`zones
and zone ranges </core/zone-sharding>` *before* sharding an empty or a
non-existing collection, the shard collection operation creates chunks
for the defined zone ranges as well as any additional chunks to cover
the entire range of the shard key values and performs an initial chunk
distribution based on the zone ranges. For more information, see
:ref:`initial-chunks-empty-collection`.

.. warning::

   Only pre-split chunks for an empty collection. Manually splitting
   chunks for a populated collection can lead to unpredictable chunk
   ranges and sizes as well as inefficient or ineffective balancing
   behavior.

To split empty chunks manually, you can run the :dbcommand:`split` command:

.. example::

   To create chunks for documents in the ``myapp.users``
   collection using the ``email`` field as the :term:`shard key`,
   use the following operation in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      for ( var x=97; x<97+26; x++ ){
          for ( var y=97; y<97+26; y+=6 ) {
              var prefix = String.fromCharCode(x) + String.fromCharCode(y);
              db.adminCommand( { split: "myapp.users", middle: { email : prefix } } );
          }
      }

   This assumes a collection size of 100 million documents.
