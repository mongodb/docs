The `MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes>`__
creates |k8s| |k8s-statefulsets| from specification files that you
wrote.

MongoDB resources are created in Kubernetes as `custom resources <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/>`__.
After you create or update a MongoDB resource specification, you direct
|k8s-op-full| to apply this specification to your |k8s| environment.
|k8s-op-short| creates the defined |k8s-statefulsets|, services and
other Kubernetes resources. After the Operator finishes creating those
objects, it updates Ops Manager deployment configuration to reflect
changes.

Each |k8s-obj| uses an |k8s-obj| specification in
:abbr:`YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)` to define the characteristics and settings of the MongoDB object: standalone, :term:`replica set`,
and :term:`sharded cluster`.

Common Resource Settings
------------------------

Every resource type must use the following settings:

Required

Optional
~~~~~~~~

Every resource type may use the following settings:

Deployment-Specific Resource Settings
-------------------------------------

Other settings you can and must use in a |k8s-mdbrsc| specification
depend upon which MongoDB deployment item you want to create:

- :ref:`standalone-settings`

- :ref:`replica-set-settings`

- :ref:`sharded-cluster-settings`
