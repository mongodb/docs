title: Disable the balancer process.
stepnum: 1
ref: disable-balancer
pre: |
   To disable the :ref:`balancer <sharding-internals-balancing>`,
   connect the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance and run
   :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` in the ``config`` database.
action:
   language: javascript
   code: |
      use config
      sh.stopBalancer()
post: |
   For more information, see the
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily` procedure.

   .. warning:: If you do not stop the balancer, the backup could have
      duplicate data or omit data as :term:`chunks <chunk>` migrate while
      recording backups.

title: Lock one secondary member of each replica set.
stepnum: 2
ref: lock-replica-set-members
pre: |
   Lock a secondary member of each replica set in the sharded cluster,
   and one secondary of the :ref:`config server replica set (CSRS)
   <replset-config-servers>`.

   Ensure that the :term:`oplog` has sufficient capacity to allow these
   secondaries to catch up to the state of the primaries after
   finishing the backup procedure. See :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing`
   for more information.
action:
  - heading: Lock shard replica set secondary.
    pre: |
      For each shard replica set in the sharded cluster, connect a
      :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the secondary member's
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and run :method:`db.fsyncLock()`. 
    language: javascript
    code: |
      db.fsyncLock()

  - heading: Lock config server replica set secondary.
    pre: |
      If locking a secondary of the CSRS, confirm that the member has
      replicated data up to some control point. To verify, first connect a
      :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the CSRS primary and perform a write
      operation with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern on a
      control collection:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      use config
      db.BackupControl.findAndModify(
         {
           query: { _id: 'BackupControlDocument' },
           update: { $inc: { counter : 1 } },
           new: true,
           upsert: true,
           writeConcern: { w: 'majority', wtimeout: 15000 }
         }
      );
  - pre: |
      The operation should return either the newly inserted document or the
      updated document:
    language: javascript
    code: |
       { "_id" : "BackupControlDocument", "counter" : 1 }
  - pre: |
      Query the CSRS secondary member for the returned control
      document. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the CSRS secondary
      to lock and use :method:`db.collection.find()` to query for the
      control document:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      db.getMongo().setReadPref('secondary');

      use config;

      db.BackupControl.find(
         { "_id" : "BackupControlDocument", "counter" : 1 }
      ).readConcern('majority');
  - post: |
       If the secondary member contains the latest control document, it
       is safe to lock the member. Otherwise, wait until the member
       contains the document or select a different secondary member
       that contains the latest control document.
  - pre: |
       To lock the secondary member, run :method:`db.fsyncLock()` on
       the member:
    language: javascript
    code: |
       db.fsyncLock()

---
title: Backup one config server.
stepnum: 3
ref: backup-config-server
pre: |
   Run :binary:`~bin.mongodump` against a config server :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instance to back up the cluster's metadata. You only need to back up
   one config server. Perform this step
   against the locked config server.
action:
  - pre: |
      Use :binary:`~bin.mongodump` with the :option:`--oplog <mongodump.--oplog>` option to
      backup one of the :ref:`config servers
      <sharding-config-server>`.
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongodump --oplog
  - pre: |
      If your deployment uses CSRS config servers, unlock the config server
      node before proceeding to the next step.
      To unlock the CSRS member, use :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` method in
      the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      db.fsyncUnlock()
---
title: Back up a replica set member for each shard.
stepnum: 4
ref: backup-replica-set-members
pre: |
   Back up the locked replica set members of the shards using
   :binary:`~bin.mongodump` with the
   :option:`--oplog <mongodump.--oplog>` option. You may back up the
   shards in parallel.
action:
   language: sh
   code: |
      mongodump --oplog
---
title: Unlock replica set members for each shard.
stepnum: 5
ref: restart-replica-set-members
pre: |
  To unlock the replica set members, use :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()`
  method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.
action: 
  language: javascript
  code: |
    db.fsyncUnlock()
post: |
  Allow these members to catch up with the state of the primary.
---
title: Re-enable the balancer process.
stepnum: 6
ref: reenable-balancer-process
pre: |
  To re-enable to balancer, connect the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to a
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance and run
  :method:`sh.setBalancerState()`.
action:
   language: javascript
   code: |
      use config
      sh.setBalancerState(true)
...
