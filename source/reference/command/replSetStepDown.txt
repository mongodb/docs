Description

.. dbcommand:: replSetStepDown

   Forces the :term:`primary` of the replica set to become a
   :term:`secondary`, triggering an :ref:`election for primary
   <replica-set-election-internals>`. The command steps down the
   primary for a specified number of seconds; during this period, the
   stepdown member is ineligible from becoming primary.

   By default, the command only steps down the primary if an
   :data:`electable <~replSetGetConfig.members[n].priority>`
   secondary is up-to-date with the primary, waiting up to 10 seconds
   for a secondary to catch up.

   The command is only valid against the primary and will error if run
   on a non-primary member. :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` can
   only run in the ``admin`` database and has the following prototype
   form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { 
          replSetStepDown: <seconds>,
          secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs: <seconds>,
          force: <true|false>
      } )

   :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` takes the following fields as arguments:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/command-replSetStepDown-field.rst

Behavior
--------

.. versionadded:: 3.0

Before stepping down, :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` will attempt to
terminate long running user operations that would block the primary
from stepping down, such as an index build, a write operation or a
map-reduce job.

To avoid rollbacks, :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown`, by default, only
steps down the primary if an electable secondary is completely caught up
with the primary. The command will wait up to the
``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs`` for a secondary to catch up.

If no electable secondary meets this criterion by the waiting period,
the primary does not step down and the command errors. However, you can
override this behavior by including the ``force: true`` option.

Upon successful stepdown, :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` forces all
clients currently connected to the database to disconnect. This helps
ensure that the clients maintain an accurate view of the replica set.

Because the disconnect includes the connection used to run the command,
you cannot retrieve the return status of the command if the command
completes successfully; i.e. you can only retrieve the return status of
the command if it errors. When running the command in a script, the
script should account for this behavior.

.. note::

   :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` blocks all writes to the primary while
   it runs.

Examples
--------

Step Down with Default Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example, run on the current primary, attempts to step
down the member for ``120`` seconds.

The operation will wait up to the default ``10`` seconds for a
secondary to catch up. If no suitable secondary exists, the primary
does not step down and the command errors.

.. note::

   The command blocks all writes to the primary while it runs.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.runCommand( { replSetStepDown: 120 } )

Specify Wait Time for Secondary Catch Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example, run on the current primary, attempts to step
down the member for ``120`` seconds, waiting up to ``15`` seconds for
an electable secondary to catch up. If no suitable secondary exists,
the primary does not step down and the command errors.

.. note::

   The command blocks all writes to the primary while it runs.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.runCommand( { replSetStepDown: 120, secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs: 15 } )

Specify Secondary Catch Up with Force Step Down
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example, run on the current primary, attempts to step
down the member for ``120`` seconds, waiting up to ``15`` seconds for
an electable secondary to catch up. Because of the ``force: true``
option, the primary steps down even if no suitable secondary exists.

.. note::

   The command blocks all writes to the primary while it runs.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.runCommand( { replSetStepDown: 120, secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs: 15, force: true } )
