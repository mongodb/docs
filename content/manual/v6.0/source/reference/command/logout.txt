.. dbcommand:: logout

   .. deprecated:: 5.0

   Attempting to use the :dbcommand:`logout` command will write an 
   error message to the log once per logout attempt.
   
   This command will be removed in a future release.   

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      { 
        logout: 1 
      }
   )


Example
-------

.. |operation-name| replace:: :dbcommand:`logout`
.. include:: /includes/note-logout-namespace.rst

  following operation:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { logout: 1 } )
