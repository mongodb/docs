   b. Click :guilabel:`Discrete` below the dropdown.

   .. example:: Area Chart

      An area chart is a good choice to easily visualize the ages where
      customers are the most concentrated. Since you are not concerned
      with exact values in this scenario but rather general trends, an
      area chart makes more sense than a line chart because the filled-in
      visualization allows us to more easily identify the most common age
      ranges.

      We use a discrete area chart, rather than continuous,
      because we are ultimately looking for a count of the customers in
      each particular age bracket determined by the chart's
      :ref:`bin size <charts-bin-data>`. Discrete charts allow us
      to perform aggregation operations on the data, whereas in a
      continuous chart each data point must come from a distinct
      document.

title: Add the desired fields to the proper encoding channels.

level: 4

   a. In the :guilabel:`Fields` section click the ``customer`` field to
      expand the ``customer`` object and view its properties.

   #. Drag the ``customer.age`` field to the :guilabel:`X Axis`
      encoding channel. The :guilabel:`X Axis` encoding channel
      dictates which field to display on the horizontal axis.

   #. Set the :guilabel:`Bin Size` to ``5``.

      .. example:: Data Binning

         Binning data groups continuous data into bins of a
         specified size. In this case, rather than plotting
         points for each individual age in the dataset, the data
         is grouped into bins of ``5`` ages. This
         provides a clearer look into the overall trend of
         the age distribution.

         For more information on data binning, see the
         :ref:`Data Binning <charts-bin-data>` section.

   #. Drag the ``_id`` field to the :guilabel:`Y Axis`
      encoding channel. The :guilabel:`Y Axis` encoding channel
      determines which field to use for the chart's
      :manual:`aggregation </aggregation>`.

      .. example:: Y Axis Encoding Channel

         Because we will be performing a :manual:`$count
         </reference/operator/aggregation/count/>` aggregation on the
         documents, it does not matter what field we use for this
         encoding channel because the chosen field does not affect the
         number of documents in each bin.

   #. In the :guilabel:`Y Axis Aggregate` dropdown, select
      :guilabel:`count`. This option counts the occurrence of each
      customer age from each sale and adds it to the visualization
      after placing it in the appropriate bin.

   Your chart should now look something like this:

   .. figure:: /images/charts/tutorial-area-in-progress-2.png
      :figwidth: 750px
      :alt: Area Chart Builder

   Customers appear to be mostly between the
   ages ``40-45``. This is where the largest area region in the
   chart occurs. Additionally, the rest of the ages appear to be
   `normally distributed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution>`_,
   meaning the average customer age is at the center of the area chart
   and there are the same number of younger and older customers. You can
   use this information to direct advertising where the largest
   customer age group is most likely to see company advertisements.
