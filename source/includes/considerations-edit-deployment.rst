Apply Changes to Cluster or Member
  If you make configuration changes to an individual MongoDB
  process within a cluster, any future changes to the cluster no longer apply to the child process.

  .. example::

     If you turn off journaling for a replica set member and
     then later change the journal commit interval for the
     replica set, the change does not apply to the member.

MongoDB Version
  To choose which versions of MongoDB are available to |mms|, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/configure-available-mongodb-version`.

  .. include:: /includes/considerations-change-mongodb-version.rst

Storage Engine

  .. important::

     .. include:: /includes/fact-mmapv1-deprecated.rst

  If you run or upgrade to MongoDB 3.0 or later and modify the MongoDB
  storage engine, |mms| shuts down and restarts the MongoDB process. For 
  a multi-member replica set, |mms| performs a rolling 
  :term:`initial sync` of each member.

  |mms| creates backup directories during the migration from one storage
  engine to the other if the host has adequate disk space. If disk space
  is insufficient, no backups are taken. |mms| *does not* delete the
  backup directories once the migration is complete. You can keep or
  delete the previous backup directories. The backup directories are
  located in  the :program:`mongod`'s data directory.

  .. example::

     If the data directory was ``/data/process``, the backup would be
     ``/data/process.bak.UNIQUENAME``. The ``UNIQUENAME`` is a random
     string that |mms| generates.

  Before you can change the :term:`storage engine` for a standalone
  instance or replica set, you must give the :term:`Automation Agent`
  write access to the MongoDB :term:`data directory`'s *parent* directory.
  The agent creates a temporary backup of the data in parent directory
  when  updating the storage engine.

  You cannot change the storage engine on a :term:`config server`. For
  more information on storage engines and the available options, see
  :manual:`Storage </core/storage>` in the MongoDB manual.

Fixed Properties
  You cannot modify the following settings after a deployment has been 
  created:

  - :option:`database path <mongod.--dbpath>`
  - The hostname, :option:`bind_ip <mongod.--bind_ip>` or 
    :option:`port <mongod.--port>` to which a MongoDB process is 
    assigned

  You *can* modify the following deployment settings:

  - :option:`log path <mongod.--logpath>` at the process level
  - :doc:`advanced options </reference/deployment-advanced-options>`

Deployment Topology
  You can make modifications at all levels of a deployment's topology,
  including child processes. 

  To modify the topology or processes, use this tutorial or one of the
  more specific tutorials:

  - :doc:`/tutorial/migrate-member-to-new-hardware`
  - :doc:`/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set`

Project-Level Modifications
  Some modifications that affect a deployment occur at the project level.
  The following changes affect every MongoDB process in the project. For
  these changes, use the specified tutorials:

  - To enable SSL for the deployment, see
    :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment`.

  - To enable authentication for the deployment, see
    :doc:`/tutorial/nav/security-enable-authentication`.

  - To add or modify MongoDB users and roles for the deployment, see
    :doc:`/tutorial/manage-mongodb-users`.

Multiple Modifications
  You can combine multiple modifications into one deployment. 

  .. example::
     You could make all the following modifications before clicking the
     :guilabel:`Review Changes` button:

     - Add the latest stable version of MongoDB to the 
       :ref:`version-manager`.

     - Enable SSL for the deployment's MongoDB processes.

     - Add a new sharded cluster running the latest stable version of 
       MongoDB from above.

  When you click :guilabel:`Review Changes`, the review displays all the
  changes on one screen for you to confirm before deploying.
