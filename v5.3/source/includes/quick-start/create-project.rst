This guide shows you how to add the MongoDB Java driver dependencies using
Maven or Gradle. We recommend that you use an integrated development
environment (IDE) such as Intellij IDEA or Eclipse IDE make it more convenient 
to configure Maven or Gradle to build and run your project.

If you are not using an IDE, see
`Building Maven <https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-building-maven.html>`_
or
`Creating New Gradle Builds <https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/>`_
