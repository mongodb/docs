Starting in 3.4, the use of the deprecated mirrored :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances as config servers (SCCC) is no longer supported. Before you
can upgrade your sharded clusters to 3.4, you must convert your config
servers from SCCC to CSRS.

To convert your config servers from SCCC to CSRS, see
:doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set`.
