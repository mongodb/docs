Numeric Types
-------------

MongoDB treats some types as equivalent for comparison purposes. For
instance, numeric types undergo conversion before comparison.

Strings
-------

Binary Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, MongoDB uses the simple binary comparison to compare
strings.

Collation
~~~~~~~~~

Collation specification has the following syntax:

Arrays

Objects
-------

MongoDB's comparison of :term:`BSON` objects uses the following order:

#. Recursively compare key-value pairs in the order that they appear
   within the BSON object.

#. Compare the field types. MongoDB uses the following comparison
   order for field types, from lowest to highest:

   a. MinKey (internal type)
   #. Null
   #. Numbers (ints, longs, doubles, decimals)
   #. Symbol, String
   #. Object
   #. Array
   #. BinData
   #. ObjectId
   #. Boolean
   #. Date
   #. Timestamp
   #. Regular Expression
   #. MaxKey (internal type)

#. If the field types are equal, compare the
   :ref:`key field names <document-field-names>`.

#. If the key field names are equal, compare the field values.

#. If the field values are equal, compare the next key/value pair
   (return to step 1). An object without further pairs is less than an
   object with further pairs.


Dates and Timestamps
--------------------

Date objects sort before Timestamp objects.

Non-existent Fields
-------------------

The comparison treats a non-existent field as if it were an empty BSON
Object. As such, a sort on the ``a`` field in documents ``{ }`` and ``{
a: null }`` would treat the documents as equivalent in sort order.

BinData
-------

MongoDB sorts ``BinData`` in the following order:

#. First, the length or size of the data.

#. Then, by the BSON one-byte subtype.

#. Finally, by the data, performing a byte-by-byte comparison.
