:orphan:

This function is considered a retryable read operation unless the pipeline contains a write stage like $out or $merge.
Upon a transient error (a network error, errors due to replica set failover, etc.) the operation is safely retried once.
If ``retryreads`` is false in the URI (see `mongoc_uri_t <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_uri_t.html>`__) the retry behavior does not apply.
