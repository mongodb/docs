The schema design process helps you prepare an effective schema for your
application. Following the schema design process helps you identify what
data your application needs and how to best organize your data to
optimize performance.

Use Cases
---------

Planning and designing your schema is best done early in your
application development process. Starting your application with good
data modeling practices helps prevent schema and performance issues as
your application grows. When you follow schema design practices early
and appropriately, you can achieve better performance and make it easier
to scale your application in the future.

You can design your schema iteratively and modify your schema as the
needs of your application change. MongoDB provides ways to seamlessly
modify your schema without downtime. However, it can still be difficult
to modify large-scale schemas that are used in production.

When you design your schema, you may need to strike a balance between
performance and simplicity. Sometimes, the most performant schema takes
many iterations and a great deal of testing to achieve. Depending on
your application and the importance of optimization, you may want to
establish a simple schema to cover basic functionality, before spending
time on optimizations.

Tasks
-----

The schema design process consists of the following steps:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Identify your workload

      Identify the operations that your application runs most
      frequently. See :ref:`data-modeling-identify-workload`.

   .. step:: Map relationships

      Identify the relationships in your application's data and decide
      whether to link or embed related data. See
      :ref:`data-modeling-map-relationships`.

   .. step:: Apply design patterns

      Apply schema design patterns to optimize reads and writes. See
      :ref:`data-modeling-apply-patterns`.

   .. step:: Create indexes

      Create indexes to support common query patterns. See
      :ref:`create-indexes-to-support-queries`.
