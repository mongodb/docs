MMS Overview
============

|mms| (MMS) is a service for monitoring MongoDB
infrastructure. MMS was created by 10gen and is provided for all users
of MongoDB. Designed for security and ease of use, MMS collects
statistics on all key server and hardware indicators and then presents
the data in a powerful web console. The data is a great asset when
optimizing applications during development and potentially invaluable
when diagnosing production issues. For sharded clusters consisting of
dozens of nodes, MMS is particularly useful because it provides a
holistic overview of MongoDB deployments so that administrators can
quickly asses the health of their clusters.

How MMS works
-------------

You enable MMS by installing a lightweight monitoring agent in the
server environment. A single agent can monitor an entire deployment of
``mongod`` and ``mongos`` instances. The agent extracts the data that 
you provide to MMS and automatically discovers
MongoDB instances in your deployment using this "seed" information. The
agent then regularly pushes data to MMS, which MMS uses to provide
reports on metrics that include memory usage, ops per second, and open
connections. If enabled, MMS can also track system performance, 
including CPU load and I/O activity. The web interface then displays
the status of each MongoDB instance, as well as historical graphs for
all collected data. You can create custom dashboards, perform
side-by-side data comparisons, and re-plot charts on different
timescales to aid analysis.

Security
--------

The agent transmits all metrics to the MMS servers over SSL
(128-bit encryption), and agent traffic is exclusively outbound. The
monitoring agent is a Python script, and you are free to examine its
source code. MMS pushes no data to the agent. The agent is
subject to firewalls and contains support for MongoDB authentication.
Monitored services are only discovered when the agent fetches
information provided to MMS or from other members of the cluster. The
agent only records server metrics: the collection of hardware and
application data must be explicitly enabled. The web interface is
secured over SSL, and extensive data access controls and audits are in
place to ensure that the safety of your data.

Installation

.. only:: saas

   MMS is compatible with all varieties of MongoDB deployments,
   regardless of the infrastructure or architecture of the MongoDB
   deployment. The agent and server installation is quick and
   straightforward, and meaningful results are available through the web
   interface in minutes. See the :doc:`install` document and
   `mms.10gen.com <http://mms.10gen.com>`_ for more information.
