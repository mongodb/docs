Use synthetic foreign keys to establish relationships between your tables before 
creating mapping rules. A synthetic foreign key represents a relationship between 
two tables, but unlike a regular foreign key, it does not exist in the source 
database and can be defined directly using {+rel-mig+}.

Steps
-----

1. On the diagram toolbar, click :guilabel:`Add a synthetic foreign key`.

#. Select the parent table.

   You can select a parent table in two ways:

   - Click on a single table or,

   - Click and drag between your choice of parent and child table. If you select 
     your parent and child table in this manner, step 5 is completed.

#. On the :guilabel:`Add relationship pane`, select the cardinality.

   - When you select :guilabel:`One to one`, each row in the parent table must 
     relate to at most one row in the child table.

   - When you select :guilabel:`One to many`, each row in the parent table can 
     relate to zero or more rows in the child table.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Parent field` drop-down and select a parent field.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Child table` drop-down and select a child table.

   To represent the potential relationship, a blue line appears between the 
   parent table and child table on the relational model.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Child field` drop-down and select a child field.

   Select a child field whose values correspond to those in the parent field.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save and close`.
