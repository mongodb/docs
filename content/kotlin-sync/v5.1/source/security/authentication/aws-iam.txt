Overview
--------

The **MONGODB-AWS** authentication mechanism uses Amazon Web Services
Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) credentials to authenticate a user to MongoDB.
You can use this mechanism only when authenticating to MongoDB Atlas.

.. tip:: Configure Atlas for AWS IAM Authentication

   To learn more about configuring MongoDB Atlas for AWS IAM authentication, see
   :atlas:`Set Up Authentication with AWS IAM </security/aws-iam-authentication/>` in
   the Atlas documentation.

Specify MONGODB-AWS Authentication
----------------------------------

To instruct the {+driver-short+} to use the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism,
you can either specify ``MONGODB-AWS`` as a parameter in the connection string or call
the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method.

In the following sections, you can learn different ways to specify the 
``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism and provide your AWS IAM credentials.

These sections contain code examples that use the following placeholders:

- ``awsKeyId``: The value of your AWS access key ID
- ``awsSecretKey``: The value of your AWS secret access key
- ``atlasUri``: The network address of your MongoDB Atlas deployment
- ``hostname``: The hostname of your MongoDB Atlas deployment
- ``port``: The port of your MongoDB Atlas deployment
- ``awsSessionToken``: The value of your AWS session token

AWS SDK 
~~~~~~~

.. note:: End of Support for AWS SDK for Java v1

   The AWS SDK for Java v1 will reach end of support on December 31, 2025. 
   AWS recommends migrating to AWS SDK for Java v2. For more information, 
   see the `end of support announcement 
   <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-aws-sdk-for-java-v1-x-on-december-31-2025/>`__ 
   on the AWS site.

AWS provides software development kits (SDKs) for Java v1 and v2.
The AWS SDK offers the following features:

- Multiple options for obtaining credentials
- Credential caching, which helps your application avoid rate limiting
- Credential provider management for use with the `Elastic Kubernetes Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html>`__

To use the AWS SDK for ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication, perform
the following steps:

1. :ref:`Specify the authentication mechanism <kotlin-mongodb-aws-sdk-specify>`.
#. :ref:`Add the SDK as a dependency to your project <kotlin-mongodb-aws-sdk-dependency>`.
#. :ref:`Supply your credentials by using one of the methods in the credential provider chain <kotlin-mongodb-aws-sdk-credentials>`.

.. _kotlin-mongodb-aws-sdk-specify:

Specify the Authentication Mechanism
````````````````````````````````````

You can specify the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism by using a connection
string or a ``MongoCredential`` object. Select the :guilabel:`Connection String`
or the :guilabel:`MongoCredential` tab below for corresponding instructions and sample code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: Connection String

      To specify the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism in the connection string, 
      set the ``authMechanism`` parameter to ``MONGODB-AWS``, as shown in the following
      example:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.kt
         :language: kotlin
         :dedent:
         :start-after:  start-aws-sdk-cred-string
         :end-before: end-aws-sdk-cred-string
      
   .. tab::
      :tabid: MongoCredential

      To specify the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential``
      object, call the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method
      and add the ``MongoCredential`` instance to your ``MongoClient``, as shown
      in the following example:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.kt
         :language: kotlin
         :dedent:
         :start-after:  start-aws-sdk-mcred
         :end-before: end-aws-sdk-mcred
         :emphasize-lines: 1, 9

.. _kotlin-mongodb-aws-sdk-dependency:

Add the AWS SDK Dependency
``````````````````````````

To add the AWS SDK as a dependency to your project, see the following
AWS documentation for the version you need:

- For the **AWS SDK for Java v2**, see the `Setting Up <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/setup.html>`__
  guide.
- For the **AWS SDK for Java v1**, see the `Getting Started <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/getting-started.html>`__
  guide.

.. note::

   For the AWS SDK for Java v2, the Java driver tests by using the
   ``software.amazon.awssdk:auth:2.30.31`` dependency.

   For the AWS SDK for Java v1, the Java driver tests by using the
   ``com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-core:1.12.782`` dependency.

.. _kotlin-mongodb-aws-sdk-credentials:

Supply Your Credentials
```````````````````````

To supply your credentials, see the following AWS documentation for the
version you need:

- To learn more about the **AWS SDK for Java v2** class the driver uses to
  get the credentials, see the `DefaultCredentialsProvider <https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/auth/credentials/DefaultCredentialsProvider.html>`__
  API documentation.

  Learn how to supply your credentials to this class from the
  `Use the default credential provider chain <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-chain>`__
  section.

- To learn more about the **AWS SDK for Java v1** class the driver uses to
  get the credentials, see the `DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html>`__
  API documentation.

  Learn how to supply your credentials to this class from the
  `Using the Default Credential Provider Chain <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default>`__
  section.

.. note::

   If you include both v1 and v2 of the AWS SDK for Java in your project,
   you must use the v2 methods to supply your credentials.

.. _kotlin-mongodb-aws-env-variables:

Specify Your Credentials in the Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide your AWS IAM credentials by instructing the driver to
use the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism and by setting the
appropriate environment variables.

To use the environment variables to supply your credentials, perform
the following steps:

1. :ref:`Specify the authentication mechanism <kotlin-mongodb-aws-env-specify>`.
#. :ref:`Add the appropriate environment variables <kotlin-mongodb-aws-env-set-vars>`.

.. _kotlin-mongodb-aws-env-specify:

Specify the Authentication Mechanism
````````````````````````````````````

You can specify the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism by using a 
``MongoCredential`` object or in the connection string.

To specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential`` object,
call the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method and add the
``MongoCredential`` instance to your ``MongoClient``, as shown in the following
example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :dedent:
   :start-after:  start-aws-env-mcred
   :end-before: end-aws-env-mcred
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 9

To specify the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism in the connection 
string, add it as a parameter as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :dedent:
   :start-after:  start-aws-env-cred-string
   :end-before: end-aws-env-cred-string

.. _kotlin-mongodb-aws-env-set-vars:

Set Environment Variables
`````````````````````````

This section shows how to provide your credentials by setting environment
variables for the following types of authentication:

- Programmatic access keys
- ECS container credentials
- EC2 container credentials

The following example shows how you can set your **programmatic access keys**
in environment variables by using ``bash`` or a similar shell:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<awsKeyId>
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<awsSecretKey>
   export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<awsSessionToken>

Omit the line that sets the ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` variable if you don't need an AWS
session token for that role.

To authenticate by using **ECS container credentials**, set the ECS
endpoint relative URI in an environment variable by using ``bash`` or
a similar shell, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI=<your ECS endpoint>

To authenticate by using **EC2 container credentials**, do not set
the AWS environment variables. The driver obtains the credentials
from the default IPv4 EC2 instance metadata endpoint.

.. _kotlin-mongodb-aws-mongoclient-configuration:

Specify Your Credentials in a MongoCredential
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can supply your AWS IAM credentials to a ``MongoClient`` by using a
``MongoCredential`` instance. To construct the ``MongoCredential`` instance
for ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication, call the 
`createAwsCredential() <{+core-api+}/MongoCredential.html#createAwsCredential(java.lang.String,char%5B%5D)>`__
factory method.

.. tip::
    
   You can supply only programmatic access keys to the
   ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` method. If you must supply ECS
   or EC2 container credentials, follow the instructions in
   :ref:`<kotlin-mongodb-aws-env-variables>`.

To use a ``MongoCredential`` object for ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication, perform
the following steps:

1. Specify the authentication mechanism.
#. Supply the credentials.

To specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential`` object,
call the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method
and add the ``MongoCredential`` instance to your ``MongoClient``, as shown
in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :dedent:
   :start-after:  start-aws-mcred
   :end-before: end-aws-mcred
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 9

If you must specify an AWS session token, pass it to the
`withMechanismProperty() <{+core-api+}/MongoCredential.html#withMechanismProperty(java.lang.String,T)>`__
method, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :dedent:
   :start-after:  start-aws-mcred-wmechprop
   :end-before: end-aws-mcred-wmechprop
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 2, 10

To refresh your credentials, you can declare a ``Supplier`` lambda expression
that returns new credentials, as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :dedent:
   :start-after:  start-aws-lambda-expression
   :end-before: end-aws-lambda-expression
   :emphasize-lines: 4-6, 9

If you must provide AWS IAM credentials in a connection string, you can add 
it to your ``MongoClientSettings`` object by calling the `applyConnectionString() <{+core-api+}/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyConnectionString(com.mongodb.ConnectionString)>`__
method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :dedent:
   :start-after:  start-aws-apply-connect-string
   :end-before: end-aws-apply-connect-string
   :emphasize-lines: 2, 5
