At this point, you can run the |newversion| binaries without the
|newversion| |features| that are incompatible with |oldversion|.

To enable these |newversion| features, set the feature compatibility
version (``FCV``) to |newversion|. You must also set ``confirm`` to 
true if upgrading to 7.0 or later.
