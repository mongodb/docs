  operating system."

level: 4
content: |
   Download the appropriate version of ``mongosh`` for your operating
   system. MongoDB provides versions of ``mongosh`` for Intel and ARM 
   architectures.

title: "Extract the files from the downloaded archive."
ref: extract-zip-macos
level: 4
content: |
   Go to the directory that contains the ``mongosh`` ``.zip`` archive,
   then unpack the ``.zip`` file. 
   
   If your computer is Intel based, run:
   
   .. code-block:: sh

      unzip mongosh-{+version+}-darwin-x64.zip

   If your computer is ARM based (M1 or M2), run:
   
   .. code-block:: sh

      unzip mongosh-{+version+}-darwin-arm64.zip


   The extracted archive has a ``bin`` folder that contains two files,
   ``mongosh`` and ``mongosh_crypt_v1.dylib``.

   If your web browser automatically extracts the archive as part of the
   download, or if you extract the archive without using the ``unzip``
   command, you may need to make the binary executable. 
   
   To make the binary executable, run the following command in the
   directory where you extracted the archive:

   .. code-block:: sh

      chmod +x bin/mongosh

   you receive a security error when starting ``mongosh`` indicating
   that the developer could not be identified or verified, perform
   the following actions:

   a. Open *System Preferences*.
   
   #. Select the *Security and Privacy* pane.

   #. Under the *General* tab, click the button to the right of the
      message about ``mongosh``, labelled either :guilabel:`Open Anyway`
      or :guilabel:`Allow Anyway` depending on your version of macOS.
