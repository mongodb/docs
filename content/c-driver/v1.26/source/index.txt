Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB C driver.
You can add the driver to your application to work with MongoDB in C.
Download the required libraries, ``libmongoc`` and ``libbson``, by following
the :ref:`obtaining_libraries` instructions or set up a runnable project by
following our tutorial.

Connect to MongoDB Atlas
------------------------

You can use the following connection snippet to test your connection to your
MongoDB deployment on Atlas:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/c-connection.c
   :language: c

This connection snippet uses the Stable API feature. You can access this feature
when connecting to MongoDB Server v5.0 and later and using the C driver v1.18 and later.

When you use this feature, you can update your driver or server without
worrying about backward compatibility issues with any commands covered by the
Stable API.

.. note::

   Starting from February 2022, the **Versioned API** is known as the **Stable API**.
   All concepts and features remain the same with this naming change.

.. _connect-atlas-no-stable-api-c-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas Without the Stable API
-----------------------------------------------

If you are using a version of MongoDB or the driver that lacks support for the
Stable API, you can use the following code snippet to test your connection
to your MongoDB deployment on Atlas:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/c-connection-no-stable-api.c
   :language: c

Compatibility
-------------

To learn about the versions of the {+mdb-server+} and the C language that are compatible with 
each version of the {+driver-short+}, see the
:driver:`Compatibility </compatibility/?driver-language=c>`
page.
