MongoDB drivers use a Server Selection algorithm to choose which
replica set member to use or, when connected to multiple
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, which :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance to use.

Server selection occurs once per operation.

Read Preference for Replica Sets
--------------------------------

Server selection occurs once per operation and is governed by the
:doc:`read preference </core/read-preference>` and ``localThresholdMS``
settings.

The read preference is re-evaluated for each operation.

Read Preference for Sharded Clusters
------------------------------------

Load Balancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is more than one :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance in the connection
seed list, the driver determines which :binary:`~bin.mongos` is the
"closest" (i.e. the member with the lowest average network
round-trip-time) and calculates the latency window by adding the
average round-trip-time of this "closest" :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance
and the ``localThresholdMS``. The driver will load balance randomly
across the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances that fall within the latency
window.

Read Preference and Shards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For sharded clusters that have replica set shards, :binary:`~bin.mongos`
applies the read preference when reading from the shards. Server
selection is governed by the :doc:`read preference
</core/read-preference>` and :setting:`replication.localPingThresholdMs` settings.
