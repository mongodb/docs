============================
Getting Started with MongoDB
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This tutorial provides an introduction to basic database operations
using the :program:`mongo` shell. :program:`mongo` is a part of the
standard MongoDB distribution and provides a full JavaScript
environment with a complete access to the JavaScript language
and all standard functions as well as a full database interface for
MongoDB. See the :api:`mongo JavaScript API <js>` documentation and
the :program:`mongo` shell :doc:`JavaScript Method Reference </reference/method>`.

The tutorial assumes that you're running MongoDB on a Linux or OS X
operating system and that you have a running database server; MongoDB
does support Windows and provides a Windows distribution with
identical operation. For instructions on installing MongoDB and
starting the database server, see the appropriate :doc:`installation
</installation>` document.

Connect to a Database
---------------------

In this section, you connect to the database server, which runs as
:program:`mongod`, and begin using the :program:`mongo` shell to
select a logical database within the database instance and access the
help text in the :program:`mongo` shell.

Connect to a :program:`mongod`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From a system prompt, start :program:`mongo` by issuing the
:program:`mongo` command, as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo

By default, :program:`mongo` looks for a database server listening on
port ``27017`` on the ``localhost`` interface. To connect to a server
on a different port or interface, use the
:option:`--port <mongo --port>` and :option:`--host <mongo --host>`
options.

Select a Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After starting the :program:`mongo` shell your session will use the
``test`` database by default. At any time, issue the following operation
at the :program:`mongo` to report the name of the current database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db

1. From the :program:`mongo` shell, display the list of
   databases, with the following operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      show dbs

#. Switch to a new database named ``mydb``, with the following
   operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use mydb

#. Confirm that your session has the ``mydb`` database as context, by
   checking the value of the ``db`` object, which returns the name
   of the current database, as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db

   At this point, if you issue the ``show dbs`` operation again, it will
   not include the ``mydb`` database. MongoDB will not permanently
   create a database until you insert data into that database. The
   :ref:`getting-started-create-documents` section describes the process
   for inserting data.

   .. versionadded:: 2.4
      ``show databases`` also returns a list of databases.

Display ``mongo`` Help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At any point, you can access help for the :program:`mongo` shell using
the following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   help

Furthermore, you can append the ``.help()`` method to some JavaScript
methods, any cursor object, as well as the ``db`` and
``db.collection`` objects to return additional help information.

.. _getting-started-create-documents:

Create a Collection and Insert Documents
----------------------------------------

In this section, you insert documents into a new :term:`collection`
named ``testData`` within the new :term:`database` named
``mydb``.

MongoDB will create a collection implicitly upon its first use. You do
not need to create a collection before inserting data. Furthermore,
because MongoDB uses :ref:`dynamic schemas <faq-schema-free>`, you also
need not specify the structure of your documents before inserting them
into the collection.

1. From the :program:`mongo` shell, confirm you are in the ``mydb``
   database by issuing the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db

#. If :program:`mongo` does not return ``mydb`` for the previous
   operation, set the context to the ``mydb`` database, with the
   following operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use mydb

#. Create two documents named ``j`` and ``k`` by using the following
   sequence of JavaScript operations:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      j = { name : "mongo" }
      k = { x : 3 }

#. Insert the ``j`` and ``k`` documents into the ``testData``
   collection with the following sequence of operations:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.testData.insert( j )
      db.testData.insert( k )

   When you insert the first document, the :program:`mongod` will
   create both the ``mydb`` database and the ``testData`` collection.

#. Confirm that the ``testData`` collection exists. Issue
   the following operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      show collections

   The :program:`mongo` shell will return the list of the collections
   in the current (i.e. ``mydb``) database. At this point, the only
   collection is ``testData``. All :program:`mongod` databases also have
   a :data:`system.indexes <<database>.system.indexes>` collection.

#. Confirm that the documents exist in the ``testData`` collection by
   issuing a query on the collection using the
   :method:`~db.collection.find()` method:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.testData.find()

   This operation returns the following results. The :doc:`ObjectId
   </reference/object-id>` values will be unique:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id" : ObjectId("4c2209f9f3924d31102bd84a"), "name" : "mongo" }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("4c2209fef3924d31102bd84b"), "x" : 3 }

   All MongoDB documents must have an ``_id`` field with a unique
   value.  These operations do not explicitly specify a value for the
   ``_id`` field, so :program:`mongo` creates a unique :doc:`ObjectId
   </reference/object-id>` value for the field before inserting it into the
   collection.

Insert Documents using a For Loop or a JavaScript Function
----------------------------------------------------------

To perform the remaining procedures in this tutorial, first add more
documents to your database using one or both of the procedures described
in :doc:`/tutorial/generate-test-data`.

Working with the Cursor
-----------------------

When you query a :term:`collection`, MongoDB returns a "cursor" object
that contains the results of the query. The :program:`mongo` shell then
iterates over the cursor to display the results. Rather than returning
all results at once, the shell iterates over the cursor 20 times to
display the first 20 results and then waits for a request to iterate
over the remaining results. In the shell, use enter ``it`` to iterate
over the next set of results.

The procedures in this section show other ways to work with a cursor.
For comprehensive documentation on cursors, see
:ref:`crud-read-cursor`.

Iterate over the Cursor with a Loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before using this procedure, make sure to add at least 25 documents to a
collection using one of the procedures in
:doc:`/tutorial/generate-test-data`. You can name your database and
collections anything you choose, but this procedure will assume the
database named ``test`` and a collection named ``testData``.

1. In the MongoDB JavaScript shell, query the ``testData`` collection
   and assign the resulting cursor object to the ``c`` variable:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var c = db.testData.find()

#. Print the full result set by using a ``while`` loop to iterate over
   the ``c`` variable:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      while ( c.hasNext() ) printjson( c.next() )

   The ``hasNext()`` function returns true if the cursor has documents.
   The ``next()`` method returns the next document. The
   ``printjson()`` method renders the document in a JSON-like format.

   The operation displays 20 documents. For example, if the documents
   have a single field named ``x``, the operation displays the field as
   well as each document's ``ObjectId``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990be6"), "x" : 1 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990be7"), "x" : 2 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990be8"), "x" : 3 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990be9"), "x" : 4 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bea"), "x" : 5 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990beb"), "x" : 6 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bec"), "x" : 7 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bed"), "x" : 8 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bee"), "x" : 9 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bef"), "x" : 10 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bf0"), "x" : 11 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bf1"), "x" : 12 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bf2"), "x" : 13 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bf3"), "x" : 14 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bf4"), "x" : 15 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bf5"), "x" : 16 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bf6"), "x" : 17 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bf7"), "x" : 18 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bf8"), "x" : 19 }
      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bf9"), "x" : 20 }

Use Array Operations with the Cursor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following procedure lets you manipulate a cursor object as if it
were an array:

1. In the :program:`mongo` shell, query the ``testData`` collection
   and assign the resulting cursor object to the ``c`` variable:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var c = db.testData.find()

#. To find the document at the array index ``4``, use the following
   operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      printjson( c [ 4 ] )

   MongoDB returns the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bea"), "x" : 5 }

   When you access documents in a cursor using the array index
   notation, :program:`mongo` first calls the ``cursor.toArray()``
   method and loads into RAM all documents returned by the cursor. The
   index is then applied to the resulting array. This operation
   iterates the cursor completely and exhausts the cursor.

   For very large result sets, :program:`mongo` may run out of
   available memory.

For more information on the cursor, see :ref:`crud-read-cursor`.

Query for Specific Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB has a rich query system that allows you to select and filter
the documents in a collection along specific fields and values. See
:ref:`read-operations-query-document` and :doc:`/core/read-operations`
for a full account of queries in MongoDB.

In this procedure, you query for specific documents in the ``testData``
:term:`collection` by passing a "query document" as a parameter to the
:method:`~db.collection.find()` method. A query document
specifies the criteria the query must match to return a document.

In the :program:`mongo` shell, query for all documents where the ``x``
field has a value of ``18`` by passing the ``{ x : 18 }`` query document
as a parameter to the :method:`~db.collection.find()` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.testData.find( { x : 18 } )

MongoDB returns one document that fits this criteria:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990bf7"), "x" : 18 }

Return a Single Document from a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the :method:`~db.collection.findOne()` method you can return a
single *document* from a MongoDB collection. The :method:`~db.collection.findOne()` method takes the same parameters as
:method:`~db.collection.find()`, but returns a document rather
than a cursor.

To retrieve one document from the ``testData`` collection, issue the
following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.testData.findOne()

For more information on querying for documents, see the
:ref:`read-operations-query-document` and :doc:`/core/read-operations` documentation.

Limit the Number of Documents in the Result Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To increase performance, you can constrain the size of the result by
limiting the amount of data your application must receive over the
network.

To specify the maximum number of documents in the result set, call the
:method:`~cursor.limit()` method on a cursor, as in the
following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.testData.find().limit(3)

MongoDB will return the following result, with different
:doc:`ObjectId </reference/object-id>` values:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990be6"), "x" : 1 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990be7"), "x" : 2 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("51a7dc7b2cacf40b79990be8"), "x" : 3 }
