CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations enable you to work
with data stored in MongoDB. Learn how to perform CRUD operations in the
following sections:

- :ref:`rust-crud-read-operations`: find and return
  documents.
- :ref:`rust-crud-write-operations`: insert, modify,
  or delete documents.

Compound operations combine functionalities of read and write
operations. To learn more about these methods, see
the :ref:`rust-compound-operations` guide.

.. To learn how to modify the way your CRUD operations execute on
.. the server, see the :ref:`rust-write-read-pref` guide.
