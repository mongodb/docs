Data verification optionally runs as a separate process that is tightly
coupled to a migration job. Data verification can be enabled for one-time 
migration jobs. This page details how to enable and debug the 
data verification process.

Enable Data Verification
------------------------

You can optionally enable data verification when 
:ref:`creating a migration job <rm-create-jobs>` on the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab.

On the :guilabel:`Migration Options` module, click the 
:guilabel:`Verify migrated data` check box for your migration job.

.. note::

   The Data Verification process can take as long or longer than the data migration job.
   You can click :guilabel:`Terminate` to cancel a Data Verification process.

To view status and metadata information about the data verification process
for a migration job, click the :guilabel:`Data Verification` drop-down menu:

   * - CANCELLING
     - The data verification process is being canceled.
   * - FAILED
     - The source and destination databases do not match. The corresponding errors are listed on the :guilabel:`Job Update Log` pane.
   * - VERIFIED
     - Data verification is successful, the source and destination databases match.
   * - VERIFYING
     - The data verification is in progress. Backend SQL and MongoDB query API commands are running to validate the migration.

Successful Data Verification
----------------------------

When a migration job is successful the status updates to :guilabel:`Verified`
and a double checkmark is displayed in the :guilabel:`History` pane:

Data Verification Issues
------------------------

If the data verification process detects any differences between the 
source database and destination collections, the errors are
reported in the Data Verification :guilabel:`Job Update Log` pane.

In this example, the data verification process is detecting that the
number of documents in the target collection do not match the source
database.

#. The Verification status is :guilabel:`Aborted`.
#. The specific issue and error detail is displayed in the 
   :guilabel:`Job Update Log` pane.
