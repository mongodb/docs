Master-slave replication preceded replica sets and made it possible to have a large number of non-master (i.e. slave) nodes, as well as to restrict replicated operations to only a single database; however, master-slave replication provides less redundancy and does not automate failover. See :ref:`replica-set-equivalent` for a replica set configuration that is equivalent to master-slave replication.
