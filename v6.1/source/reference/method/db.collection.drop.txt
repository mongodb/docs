Definition
----------

.. method:: db.collection.drop(<options>)

   .. |dbcommand| replace:: :dbcommand:`drop` command
   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method-alt

   Removes a collection or :ref:`view <views-landing-page>` from the database.
   The method also removes any indexes associated with the dropped
   collection. The method provides a wrapper around the
   :dbcommand:`drop` command.

   :method:`db.collection.drop()` has the form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.drop( { writeConcern: <document> } )

   :method:`db.collection.drop()` takes an optional document with the
   following field:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 80

      * - Field
        - Description

      * - writeConcern

        - Optional. A document expressing the :doc:`write concern
          </reference/write-concern>` of the
          :method:`db.collection.drop()` operation. Omit to use the
          default write concern.

          .. include:: /includes/extracts/mongos-operations-wc-drop.rst

   :returns:
     - ``true`` when successfully drops a collection.
     - ``false`` when collection to drop does not exist.

Behavior
--------

- The :method:`db.collection.drop()` method and :dbcommand:`drop`
  command create an :ref:`change-event-invalidate` for any
  :doc:`/changeStreams` opened on dropped collection.

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/zoned-sharding-drop-collection-change.rst

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/5.0-changes-drop-sharding.rst

- Starting in MongoDB 6.0, the :method:`db.collection.drop()` method 
  drops the specified collection and any internal collections related 
  to encrypted fields. 

  .. warning::
  
     The :method:`db.collection.drop()` method's behavior differs from
     the driver's ``drop`` method's behavior. The driver's connection 
     must have automatic encryption enabled in order to drop both the 
     specified collection and any internal collections related to
     encrypted fields. ``mongosh`` *always* drops the specified 
     collection and any internal collections related to encrypted
     fields.

Reusing Dropped Collection Names on Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a sharded cluster, if you create a collection that has the same name 
as a previously deleted collection prior to MongoDB 5.0, 
:binary:`~bin.mongos` may forward operations to the wrong shard.
To avoid this situation use the version-specific instructions below:

For a sharded cluster running **MongoDB 5.0 or later**, 
no special action is required. Use the ``drop()`` method
and then create a new collection with the same name.

For a sharded cluster running **MongoDB 4.4 or earlier**, 
if you use the ``drop()`` method and then create a new collection with 
the same name, you must either:

-  Flush the cached routing table on every :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   using :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig`.

-  Use :method:`db.collection.remove()` to remove the existing
   documents and reuse the collection.

Flushing the cached routing tables is the preferred procedure because it
is faster than removing sharded collections with 
:method:`db.collection.remove()`. Only use the ``remove()`` approach if 
you want to avoid flushing the cache.

Example
-------

Drop a Collection Using Default Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation drops the ``students`` collection in the
current database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.drop()

Drop a Collection Using ``w: 1`` Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:method:`db.collection.drop()` accepts an options document.

The following operation drops the ``students`` collection in the
current database. The operation uses the
:writeconcern:`1 <\<number\>>` write concern:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.drop( { writeConcern: { w: 1 } } )
