         To delete at most a single document that matches a specified

         MongoDB Compass provides a simple way to delete a document
         from a collection. The following example shows how to delete
         the document with ``item`` equal to ``paper`` from the
         ``inventory`` collection:

         .. note::

            In this example we are using the Compass
            :ref:`Table View <documents-table-view>` to delete the
            document. The deletion process using the Compass
            :ref:`List View <documents-list-view>` follows a very
            similar approach.

            For more information on the differences between Table View
            and List View in Compass, refer to the
            :ref:`Compass documentation <compass-view-documents>`.

Delete Behavior
---------------

Indexes
~~~~~~~

Delete operations do not drop indexes, even if deleting all documents
from a collection.

Atomicity
~~~~~~~~~

All write operations in MongoDB are atomic on the level of a single
document. For more information on MongoDB and atomicity, see
:doc:`/core/write-operations-atomicity`.

Write Acknowledgement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With write concerns, you can specify the level of acknowledgement
requested from MongoDB for write operations. For details, see
:doc:`/reference/write-concern`.
