  MongoDB stores data records as
  :manual:`documents </core/document/>`. Documents are composed of
  field-value pairs.

  To create your document, begin by specifying field-value pairs. To
  define :manual:`data types </reference/bson-types/>` for your
  fields, use the dropdown to the right of the value input. A single
  document can contain multiple data types.

  To add additional fields, hover over the number to the left of a
  field so the number turns to a :icon-fa5:`plus` icon. Click the
  :icon-fa5:`plus` and click :guilabel:`Add Field After <Field Name>`.

  To remove a field, hover over a field and click the ``X`` icon
  which appears to the left of the field.

  .. example::

     The following sample document contains values of varying
     types:

     .. figure:: /images/getting-started-gui-insert-doc.png
        :scale: 90%
        :alt: Image showing a sample document

     The above fields have the following data types:

     - ``_id`` holds an *ObjectId*.

     - ``name`` holds an *embedded document* that contains the
       fields ``first`` and ``last``.

     - ``birth`` and ``death`` hold values of the *Date* type.

     - ``contribs`` holds an *array of strings*.

     - ``views`` holds a value of the *Int64* type.

     To learn more, see :manual:`Documents </core/document/>`
     in the MongoDB manual.
