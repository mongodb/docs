|mms-full| can automate, monitor, and back up your MongoDB
infrastructure.

.. _automation:

Automation
----------

|mms| Automation enables you to configure and maintain MongoDB nodes
and clusters.

   :alt: "Automation coordinates MongoDB instances running in a public cloud, in your private data center, or on your local system."
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

MongoDB Agents using Automation on each MongoDB host can maintain your
MongoDB deployments. You can
:doc:`install </tutorial/nav/install-mongodb-agent>` the
:doc:`MongoDB Agent </tutorial/nav/mongodb-agent>`. Automation can
:doc:`add hosts </tutorial/nav/add-servers>` and
:doc:`deploy and upgrade new or existing clusters </tutorial/nav/manage-hosts>`.

.. _monitoring-functional-overview:

Monitoring
----------

|mms| Monitoring provides real-time reporting, visualization, and
alerting on key database and hardware indicators.

How Monitoring Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you activate Monitoring on a MongoDB host, Monitoring collects
statistics from the nodes in your MongoDB deployment. The Agent
transmits database statistics back to |mms| to report deployment status
in real time. You can :doc:`set alerts </tutorial/nav/alerts>` on
indicators you choose.

.. _mms-backup-functional-overview:

Backup
------

|mms| Backup provides scheduled
:doc:`snapshots </tutorial/nav/backup-use-operations>` and
point-in-time
:doc:`recovery </tutorial/nav/backup-restore-deployments>`
of your MongoDB :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` and
:manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`.

How Backup Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you activate Backup for a MongoDB deployment, Backup takes
snapshots of data from the MongoDB processes you have specified.

Backup Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backups rely upon the
:manual:`MongoDB version compatibility</reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`
of your database.
This Feature Compatibility Version ranges from the current version to
one version earlier. For MongoDB 4.2, the |fcv| can be ``4.0`` or
``4.2``.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: |fcv| 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      .. include:: /includes/backup/wtchk-process-overview-main-om.rst

      The {+mdbagent+} uses WiredTiger's incremental backup cursor to
      capture the incremental changes.

   .. tab:: |fcv| 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      Once backup has started, |mms| backs up the data as an ongoing
      and continuous process. This process continues creating snapshots
      as long as the head database remains synchronized with the
      database.

      .. include:: /includes/backup/legacy-process-overview-main-om.rst

      The {+mdbagent+} then tails each replica set's :manual:`oplog </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>`
      to maintain on disk a standalone database, called a
      :opsmgr:`head database </reference/glossary/#std-term-head-database>`. |mms| maintains one
      head database for each backed-up replica set. The head
      database stays consistent with the original :manual:`primary </reference/glossary/#std-term-primary>` up
      to the last oplog that the {+mdbagent+} supplies.

The backup process works in this manner regardless of how snapshots are
stored.

Backup uses a MongoDB instance version equal to or greater than the
version of the replica set it backs up.

Backup takes and stores snapshots based on a user-defined
:ref:`snapshot retention policy <snapshot-frequency-and-retention>`.
Sharded cluster snapshots temporarily stop the balancer. The snapshots
then can insert a marker token into all shards and config servers in
the cluster. |mms| takes a :manual:`snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>` when the marker tokens
appear in the snapshot data.

   :hidden:

   .. tab:: |fcv| 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      |mms| can back up data as a full or incremental backup. |mms|
      requires a full backup:

      - For your first backup.
      - After a snapshot has been deleted.
      - If the blockstore block size has been changed.

      Incremental backups reduce network transfer and storage costs.

   .. tab:: |fcv| 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      How much storage capacity you need depends on both the number
      of snapshots and the type of snapshot storage you choose. The
      following table outlines the differences in snapshot stores:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 25 75

         * - Snapshot Store
           - Description

         * - MongoDB blockstore
           - Only the differences between each successive
             :manual:`snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>` are stored. Compression and
             block-level :term:`deduplication` reduce the size of
             snapshot data.

         * - |aws| |s3| bucket
           - Only the differences between each successive
             :manual:`snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>` are stored. Compression and
             block-level :term:`deduplication` reduce the size of
             snapshot data.

         * - File system store
           - Depending on the configuration, compression reduces the
             size of the :manual:`snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>` data.

      All snapshots represent a full backup.

To learn more about how to configure backups, see
:doc:`Backup Configuration Options </core/backup-preparations>`.

.. _restores:

Restore Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backup can restore data from a complete scheduled snapshot or from
a selected point between snapshots.

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: |fcv| 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      You can restore :manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>` and
      :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` from selected points in time.

   .. tab:: |fcv| 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      - For :manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`, you can restore
        from :ref:`checkpoints <checkpoint>` between snapshots.

      - For :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`, you can restore from
        selected points in time.

When you restore from a :manual:`snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>`, |mms| reads directly from
the snapshot storage. You can restore the snapshot:

- To another cluster.
- To download the snapshot files from an |https| link.

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: |fcv| 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      When you restore from a point in time, |mms| does the following:
      
      1. Restores a full snapshot from the snapshot storage.
      #. Applies stored :manual:`oplogs </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>` until it reaches the 
         specified point.
      #. Delivers the snapshot and oplog updates using the same
         |https| mechanisms.

      You can configure how much of the oplog you want to keep per
      backup. This affects the amount of time a point-in-time restore
      can cover.

   .. tab:: |fcv| 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      When you restore from a checkpoint or point in time, |mms| does the following:

      1. Restores a full snapshot from the snapshot storage. 
      #. Applies stored :manual:`oplogs </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>` until it reaches the
         specified point. 
      #. Delivers the snapshot and oplog updates using the same |https| mechanisms. 
         To enable checkpoints, see :ref:`enable-cluster-checkpoints`.

      You can configure how much of the oplog you want to keep per
      backup. This affects how much time a checkpoint and
      point-in-time restore can cover.
