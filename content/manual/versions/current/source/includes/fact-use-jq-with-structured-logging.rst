When working with MongoDB structured logging, you can use the third-party
`jq command-line utility <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_ for easy 
pretty-printing of log entries, and powerful key-based matching and filtering.

``jq`` is an open-source JSON parser, and is available for
Linux, Windows, and macOS.
