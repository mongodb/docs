Logging
=======

By default, logging is enabled via the popular `SLF4J
<https://www.slf4j.org/>`__ API. Logging is optional, so the driver
uses SLF4J if the driver detects the presence of SLF4J API (class
``org.slf4j.Logger``) in the classpath.

Otherwise, the driver logs a single warning via JUL
(``java.util.logging``) and logging is otherwise disabled.

The driver uses the following logger names:

- ``org.mongodb.driver``: the root logger
  
  - ``cluster``: for logs related to monitoring of the MongoDB servers to
    which the driver connects
  
  - ``connection``: for logs related to connections and connection pools
  
  - ``protocol``: for logs related to protocol messages sent to and
    received from a MongoDB server

    - ``insert``: for logs related to insert messages and responses
    
    - ``update``: for logs related to update messages and responses
    
    - ``delete``: for logs related to delete messages and responses
    
    - ``query``: for logs related to query messages and responses
    
    - ``getmore``: for logs related to ``getmore`` messages and responses
    
    - ``killcursor``: for logs related to ``killcursor`` messages and responses
    
    - ``command``: for logs related to command messages and responses

  - ``uri``: for logs related to connection string parsing
  
  - ``management``: for logs related to JMX
