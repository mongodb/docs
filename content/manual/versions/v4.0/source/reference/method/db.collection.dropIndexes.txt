===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

.. method:: db.collection.dropIndexes()

   Drops all indexes other than the required index on the ``_id``
   field. Only call :method:`~db.collection.dropIndexes()` as a method on a
   collection object.

.. warning::

   This command obtains a write lock on the affected database and
   will block other operations until it has completed.

Behavior
--------

Dropping an Index during Index Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid dropping an index on a collection while any index is being
replicated on a secondary. If you attempt to drop an index from a
collection on a :term:`primary` while the collection has a background
index building on a :term:`secondary`, reads will be halted across all
namespaces and replication will halt until the background index build
completes.
