":term:`Sharding<sharding>` is a method for distributing data across "
"multiple machines. MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very"
" large data sets and high throughput operations."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/sharding.txt:27
msgid ""
"Database systems with large data sets or high throughput applications can"
" challenge the capacity of a single server. For example, high query rates"
" can exhaust the CPU capacity of the server. Working set sizes larger "
"than the system's RAM stress the I/O capacity of disk drives."

"There are two methods for addressing system growth: vertical and "
"horizontal scaling."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/sharding.txt:35
msgid ""
"*Vertical Scaling* involves increasing the capacity of a single server, "
"such as using a more powerful CPU, adding more RAM, or increasing the "
"amount of storage space. Limitations in available technology may restrict"
" a single machine from being sufficiently powerful for a given workload. "
"Additionally, Cloud-based providers have hard ceilings based on available"
" hardware configurations. As a result, there is a practical maximum for "
"vertical scaling."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/sharding.txt:42
msgid ""
"*Horizontal Scaling* involves dividing the system dataset and load over "
"multiple servers, adding additional servers to increase capacity as "
"required. While the overall speed or capacity of a single machine may not"
" be high, each machine handles a subset of the overall workload, "
"potentially providing better efficiency than a single high-speed high-"
"capacity server. Expanding the capacity of the deployment only requires "
"adding additional servers as needed, which can be a lower overall cost "
"than high-end hardware for a single machine. The trade off is increased "
"complexity in infrastructure and maintenance for the deployment."
