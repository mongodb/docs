Screenshot Guidelines and Process
=================================

.. include:: /style-guide/includes/page-needs-update.rst

When your content references a user interface (UI), consider whether
you need to include screenshots. Screenshots can be helpful when text
alone cannot adequately convey instructions, and users like screenshots
and find them useful. However, screenshots are difficult and
time-consuming to maintain, and present translation problems.
Therefore, you should minimize the use of screenshots within your
content.

When to Use Screenshots
-----------------------

You can use screenshots for the following purposes:

-  Orient users in a complicated or long procedure

-  Show complex windows or dialog boxes, such as those that contain
   multiple subsets of information, with free-form text fields and many
   options available for selection

-  Emphasize a new feature or change in the UI

However, *do not* create or use screenshots of the following items:

-  Code samples (instead, show code samples in code blocks)

-  Dialog boxes that are easy to understand, such as drop-down lists
   and option buttons with few or no free-form text fields

-  Confirmation boxes

-  License agreement boxes

-  Message text (instead show message text within regular text)

-  Progress bars

-  Welcome windows

-  Wizard pages, especially Welcome pages and other simple pages

-  Tables created in another authoring tool

Screenshot Alternatives
-----------------------

As an alternative to screenshots, use the correct names of the UI
labels with which the user must interact and the values that they must
choose or enter. Show the names of buttons, options, check boxes,
menus, windows, dialog boxes, and so on as they appear on the UI. For
example, for straightforward instructions like, "To open a file, select
**File > Open**," a screenshot is not required.

Before You Create a Screenshot
------------------------------

Install Jing to capture and edit screenshots. Jing is available as `a
free download <https://www.techsmith.com/jing.html>`__.

To learn how to take a screenshot and make a callout, use the Jing
`capture an image <https://www.techsmith.com/tutorial-jing-capture-an-image.html>`__
tutorial.

.. note::

   Jing does not support Linux distributions, but you can use
   other programs such as gscreendemp, GreenShot, and Shutter on Linux.

Screenshots in Procedures
-------------------------

If you include a screenshot in a procedure, place it directly under the
step that it illustrates. Do not rely on the screenshot to show
information or values that the user must enter; always provide that
information in the text of the steps. However, ensure that the
screenshot accurately reflects the directions and values in the step
text.

Screenshot Checklist
--------------------

Use the following standards when creating your screenshots:

-  **Size**: Make screenshots no larger than 600 pixels wide.
-  **Scope**: Limit the scope of a screenshot to just the portion of
   the UI that shows the action, plus enough surrounding detail to help
   the user locate the item.
-  **Callouts**: Use only arrows and boxes for callouts. Use **Red**
   (hexadecimal color **FF0000**) for all callout arrows and boxes.
-  **File name**: Create unique and meaningful file names to easily
   differentiate between screenshots.
-  **Titles:** Titles are not required, especially for screenshots
   in procedures and tutorials. If you want to add a title to a
   screenshot for clarity, follow the guidelines in :ref:`titles-and-headings`.
