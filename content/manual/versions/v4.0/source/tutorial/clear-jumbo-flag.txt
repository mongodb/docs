If MongoDB cannot split a chunk that exceeds the :ref:`specified chunk
size <sharding-chunk-size>`, MongoDB labels the chunk as 
:ref:`jumbo <jumbo-chunks>`.

If the chunk size no longer exceeds the :ref:`specified chunk size 
<sharding-chunk-size>`, MongoDB clears the ``jumbo`` flag for the chunk
when the :binary:`~bin.mongos` rewrites the chunk metadata.

In cases where you need to clear the flag manually, the following
procedures outline the steps to manually clear the ``jumbo`` flag.

Procedures
----------

.. _preferred-method-clear-jumbo:

Divisible Chunks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preferred way to clear the ``jumbo`` flag from a chunk is to
attempt to split the chunk. If the chunk is divisible, MongoDB removes
the flag upon successful split of the chunk.

   .. include:: /includes/steps/clear-jumbo-flag-preferred.rst

Indivisible Chunks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some instances, MongoDB cannot split the no-longer ``jumbo`` chunk,
such as a chunk with a range of single shard key value, and the
preferred method to clear the flag is not applicable. In such cases,
you can clear the flag using the following steps.

.. container::

   .. tabs::
   
      .. tab:: For MongoDB v4.0.15+
         :tabid: clear-flag-command

         Starting in 4.0.15, MongoDB provides the
         :dbcommand:`clearJumboFlag` command to manually clear the
         ``jumbo`` flag.

         .. important::

            Only use this method if the :ref:`preferred method
            <preferred-method-clear-jumbo>` is *not* applicable.

         .. include:: /includes/steps/clear-jumbo-flag-command.rst
      

      .. tab:: For MongoDB 4.0.14 and earlier
         :tabid: clear-flag-manual


         .. important::

            Only use this method if the :ref:`preferred method
            <preferred-method-clear-jumbo>` is *not* applicable.

            Before modifying the :doc:`config database
            </reference/config-database>`, *always* back up the config database.

         .. include:: /includes/steps/clear-jumbo-flag.rst
      
   If you clear the ``jumbo`` flag for a chunk that still exceeds the
   chunk size, MongoDB will re-label the chunk as ``jumbo`` when MongoDB
   tries to move the chunk.
