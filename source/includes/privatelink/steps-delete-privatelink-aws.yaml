  a. Click the :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` tab.

  #. Next to the private endpoint you want to remove, click
     :guilabel:`Terminate`.

  #. To confirm, click :guilabel:`Confirm` in the dialog.

  .. note::

     When you delete a private endpoint from a region in
     |cloudgov-short|, you must manually 
     :aws:`delete the private endpoint </vpc/latest/userguide/delete-vpc-endpoint.html>` 
     in |aws|. |aws| lists the endpoint as ``rejected``. 
     |cloudgov-short| can't delete this resource because it lacks the 
     required permissions.
