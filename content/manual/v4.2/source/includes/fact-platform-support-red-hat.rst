.. [#oracle-linux]

   MongoDB only supports Oracle Linux running the Red Hat Compatible
   Kernel (RHCK). MongoDB does **not** support the Unbreakable
   Enterprise Kernel (UEK).

.. [#rocky-alma-note]
   MongoDB on-premises products released for RHEL version 8.0+ are 
   compatible with and supported on Rocky Linux version 8.0+ and 
   AlmaLinux version 8.0+, contingent upon those distributions meeting their 
   obligation to deliver full RHEL compatibility.
