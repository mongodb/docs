Query with {+asql+}
=========================

.. meta::
   :description: Run SQL-style queries on federated database instances using Atlas SQL Interface for data visualization and reporting with BI tools like Power BI and Tableau.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can run SQL-style queries to search data on your {+fdi+}\s using the 
{+asql+} Interface. This capability allows you to visualize, graph, and 
report on your |service| data using relational business intelligence 
tools such as 
`Power BI <https://powerbi.microsoft.com/>`__ and 
`Tableau <https://www.tableau.com/>`__.

.. note:: Considerations

   {+asql+} Interface only supports read operations. You cannot write 
   data to your |service| {+cluster+} with the {+asql+} Interface.

.. important:: MongoDB Minimum Version

   If some or all of your data comes from |a-service| cluster, you must 
   use MongoDB version 5.0 or greater for that cluster to 
   take advantage of {+asql+}.

The {+asql+} Interface is available by default when you create a 
{+fdi+}. {+adf+} automatically creates collection schemas for {+asql+} query 
compilation and type inference. To learn more about the 
schema, see :ref:`Schema Management <sql-schema-management>`.

To use the {+asql+} Interface to run SQL queries, connect to your data 
using a MongoDB SQL Driver or one of the BI tool custom connectors. To 
learn more about the different connection options, see 
:ref:`Connect <sql-connect>`.

Components
----------

The {+asql+} interface includes the following components:

{+FDI+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A {+fdi+} is a deployment of {+adf+}. Each {+fdi+} contains virtual 
databases and collections that map to data in your data stores. This 
also provides a SQL schema and translates {+asql+} queries between 
your BI tool and your |service| data.

Custom Connector or SQL Driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :ref:`custom connector <sql-custom-connectors>` or a :ref:`SQL driver <sql-standalone-drivers>` 
provides a standard method to connect to a |bi| tool. 
If you are using a BI tool, check which connections it supports.

BI Tool
~~~~~~~
A visualization and reporting tool, such as Power BI or Tableau.

Pricing
-------

Querying your {+fdi+} with {+asql+} incurs data transfer charges. See :ref:`atlas-data-federation-billing` to
learn more about the costs associated with {+adf+}.

Get Started
-----------

To start querying your |service| data with {+asql+}, 
:ref:`enable the {+asql+} Interface <enable-sql-interface>`
and :ref:`connect to your data <sql-connect>`
with a driver or BI tool of your choice.
