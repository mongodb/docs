Embed Charts with an iframe
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 2
   :class: singlecol

You can embed a chart into a web application with an iframe and specify
settings such as height, width, refresh interval, and display theme.

Charts embedded within an iframe may be either:

- Unauthenticated, in which case they are viewable by anyone.
- Authenticated with a Verified Signature.

  .. note::

     Authentication with a Verified Signature is deprecated. The
     :ref:`Embedding Charts SDK <embedding-charts-sdk>` offers authentication
     through several :ref:`authentication providers <configure-auth-providers>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

- You must be a dashboard :ref:`Author <dashboard-permissions>` to enable
  embedding for a chart.
- :ref:`add-data-source`
- :ref:`create-new-dashboard`
- :ref:`create-new-chart`

     - id: unauthenticated
       name: Unauthenticated
       content: |

     - id: verified-signature
       name: Verified Signature (Deprecated)
       content: |

         .. important::

            Using a Verified Signature for authentication is deprecated.
            Instead, refer to the
            :guilabel:`Authenticated Embedding` tab for
            instructions on securing your charts.

         .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-embedding-iframe-verified.rst

After your iframe code is ready with any options you've set, you can place
it in a web page to display your chart.
