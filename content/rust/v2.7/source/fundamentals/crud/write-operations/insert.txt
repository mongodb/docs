Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to **insert** documents into a MongoDB
collection.

Before you can find, update, and delete any documents in MongoDB, you need
to insert them. You can insert documents by using the following methods:

- ``insert_one()`` to insert one document
- ``insert_many()`` to insert one or more documents

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`The _id Field <rust-retrieve-find>` describes the ``_id`` field
  that each document contains

- :ref:`Insert a Document <rust-insert-one>` describes how to use the
  driver to insert a single document into a collection

- :ref:`Insert Multiple Documents <rust-insert-multiple>` describes how to use the
  driver to insert multiple documents into a collection

- :ref:`Additional Information <rust-crud-insert-addtl-info>`
  provides links to resources and API documentation for types
  and methods mentioned in this guide

.. _rust-id-field:

The _id Field
-------------

In MongoDB, each document *must* contain a unique ``_id`` field.
MongoDB allows you to manage this field in the following ways:

- Manage this field yourself, ensuring that each ``_id`` value you set
  is unique. 
- Let the driver automatically generate unique ``ObjectId`` values. The
  driver generates a unique ``ObjectId`` value for each document if you do
  not specify a value for the ``_id`` field when performing an insert.

Unless you provide strong guarantees for uniqueness, we recommend that
you let the driver automatically generate ``_id`` values for your
documents.

.. important:: Duplicate _id Values

   If you attempt to perform a write operation that includes duplicate ``_id``
   values, the duplicate values violate unique index constraints and cause
   the write operation to fail.

To learn more about the ``_id`` field, see :manual:`Unique Indexes
</core/index-unique/>` in the Server manual.

To learn more about document structure and rules, see
:manual:`Documents </core/document>` in the Server manual.

.. _rust-insert-one:

Insert a Document
-----------------

Use the ``insert_one()`` method to insert a single document into a
collection.

Upon successful insertion, the method returns an
``InsertOneResult`` instance that contains the ``_id`` of the inserted
document.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``insert_one()`` method to insert a
document into the ``books`` collection:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/insert.rs
      :start-after: begin-insert-one
      :end-before: end-insert-one
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Inserted document with _id: 8

.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/automatic-creation.rst

Modify insert_one Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``insert_one()`` method by
constructing and passing an ``InsertOneOptions`` struct. 

.. note:: Instantiating Options
   
   The {+driver-short+} implements the Builder design pattern for the
   creation of many different types, including ``InsertOneOptions``.
   You can use each type's ``builder()`` method to construct an options
   instance by chaining option builder functions one at a time.

The following table describes the options available in ``InsertOneOptions``:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :class: compatibility-large

   * - Option
     - Description

   * - ``bypass_document_validation``
     - | If ``true``, allows the driver to perform a write that violates
         document-level validation. To learn more about validation, see
         the guide on :ref:`rust-schema-validation`.
       |
       | Type: ``bool``
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``write_concern``
     - | The write concern for the operation. If you don't set this
         option, the operation inherits the write concern set for
         the collection. To learn more about write concerns, see
         :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>` in the
         Server manual.
       |
       | Type: ``WriteConcern``

   * - ``comment``
     - | An arbitrary ``Bson`` value tied to the operation to trace
         it through the database profiler, ``currentOp``, and
         logs. This option is available only when connecting to
         {+server+} versions 4.4 and later.
       |    
       | Type: ``Bson``
       | Default: ``None``

.. _rust-insertone-bypass-validation-ex:

The following code shows how to construct an ``InsertOneOptions``
instance:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/insert.rs
   :start-after: begin-one-options
   :end-before: end-one-options
   :language: rust
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. _rust-insert-multiple:

Insert Multiple Documents
-------------------------

Use the ``insert_many()`` method to insert multiple documents into a
collection.

Upon successful insertion, the method returns an
``InsertManyResult`` instance that contains the ``_id`` values of the
inserted documents.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``insert_many()`` method to insert
multiple documents into the ``books`` collection:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/insert.rs
      :start-after: begin-insert-many
      :end-before: end-insert-many
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Inserted documents with _ids:
      Int32(5)
      Int32(6)
      Int32(7)

.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/automatic-creation.rst

Modify insert_many Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``insert_many()`` method by
constructing and passing an ``InsertManyOptions`` struct. The
following table describes the options available in
``InsertManyOptions``:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :class: compatibility-large

   * - Option
     - Description

   * - ``bypass_document_validation``
     - | If ``true``, allows the driver to perform a write that violates
         document-level validation. To learn more about validation, see
         the guide on :ref:`rust-schema-validation`.
       |
       | Type: ``bool``
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``ordered``
     - | If ``true``, when any insert fails, the operation returns
         without inserting the remaining documents. If ``false``, even
         if an insert fails, the operation continues with the remaining
         writes. To learn more about ordered inserts, see the
         :ref:`Ordered Behavior Example <rust-ordered-behavior>` section
         of this guide.
       |
       | Type: ``bool``
       | Default: ``true``

   * - ``write_concern``
     - | The write concern for the operation. If you don't set this
         option, the operation inherits the write concern set for
         the collection. To learn more about write concerns, see
         :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>` in the
         Server manual.
       |
       | Type: ``WriteConcern``

   * - ``comment``
     - | An arbitrary ``Bson`` value tied to the operation to trace
         it through the database profiler, ``currentOp``, and
         logs. This option is available only when connecting to
         {+server+} versions 4.4 and later.
       |
       | Type: ``Bson``
       | Default: ``None``

The following code shows how to construct an ``InsertManyOptions``
instance:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/insert.rs
   :start-after: begin-many-options
   :end-before: end-many-options
   :language: rust
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. _rust-ordered-behavior:

Ordered Behavior Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assume you want to insert the following documents into the ``books``
collection:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": 1, "title": "Where the Wild Things Are" }
   { "_id": 2, "title": "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" }
   { "_id": 1, "title": "Blueberries for Sal" }
   { "_id": 3, "title": "Goodnight Moon" }

When you attempt to insert these documents, the result depends on the
value of the ``ordered`` option in your ``InsertManyOptions``:

- If ``ordered`` is ``true`` (the default value), the driver throws a
  ``BulkWriteError`` when it attempts to insert the document with the
  duplicate ``_id`` value. However, the driver still inserts the
  documents before the error occurs. 

- If you set ``ordered`` to ``false``, the driver still throws a
  ``BulkWriteError`` when it attempts to insert the document with the
  duplicate ``_id`` value, but it inserts every other document.

The following code shows how to perform an unordered write operation to
insert the preceding documents:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/insert.rs
   :start-after: begin-unordered
   :end-before: end-unordered
   :emphasize-lines: 8-9
   :language: rust
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Even though this operation results in a ``BulkWriteError``, you can
still find the non-error-producing documents in your collection:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": 1, "title": "Where the Wild Things Are" }
   { "_id": 2, "title": "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" }
   { "_id": 3, "title": "Goodnight Moon" }
