Write Concern Reference
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

:doc:`Write concern </core/write-concern>` describes the guarantee that
MongoDB provides when reporting on the success of a write operation.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6
   A new protocol for :ref:`write operations
   <rel-notes-write-operations>` integrates write concerns with the
   write operations and eliminates the need to call the
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` command. Previous versions required a
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` command immediately after a write
   operation to specify the write concern.

Read Isolation Behavior

Available Write Concern
-----------------------

Write concern can include the :ref:`w <wc-w>` option to specify the
required number of acknowledgments before returning, the :ref:`j
<wc-j>` option to require writes to the journal before returning, and
:ref:`wtimeout <wc-wtimeout>` option to specify a time limit to prevent
write operations from blocking indefinitely.

In sharded clusters, :program:`mongos` instances will pass the write
concern on to the shard.

.. _wc-w:

``w`` Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``w`` option provides the ability to disable write concern entirely
*as well as* specify the write concern for :term:`replica sets <replica
set>`. 

MongoDB uses ``w: 1`` as the default write concern. ``w: 1``
provides basic receipt acknowledgment.

The ``w`` option accepts the following values:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Value

     - Description

   * - ``1``

     - Provides acknowledgment of write operations on a standalone
       :program:`mongod` or the :term:`primary` in a replica set.

       This is the default write concern for MongoDB.

   * - ``0``

     - Disables basic acknowledgment of write operations, but returns
       information about socket exceptions and networking errors to the
       application.

       If you disable basic write operation acknowledgment but require
       journal commit acknowledgment, the journal commit prevails, and
       the server will require that :program:`mongod` acknowledge
       the write operation.

   * - <Number greater than 1>

     - Guarantees that write operations have propagated successfully to
       the specified number of replica set members including the
       primary.

       For example, ``w: 2`` indicates acknowledgements from the
       primary and at least one secondary.

       If you set ``w`` to a number that is greater than the number of
       set members that hold data, MongoDB waits for the non-existent
       members to become available, which means MongoDB blocks
       indefinitely.

   * - ``"majority"``

     - Confirms that write operations have propagated to the majority
       of configured replica set: a majority of the set's configured
       members must acknowledge the write operation before it succeeds.
       This allows you to avoid hard coding assumptions about the size
       of your replica set into your application.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-master-slave-majority.rst

   * - <tag set>

     - By specifying a :ref:`tag set
       <replica-set-configuration-tag-sets>`, you can have fine-grained
       control over which replica set members must acknowledge a write
       operation to satisfy the required level of write concern.

.. _wc-j:

``j`` Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``j`` option confirms that the :program:`mongod` instance has
written the data to the on-disk journal. This ensures that data is not
lost if the :program:`mongod` instance shuts down unexpectedly. Set to
``true`` to enable.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6
   Specifying a write concern that includes ``j: true`` to
   a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` running with
   :option:`--nojournal` option now errors. Previous versions would
   ignore the ``j: true``.

.. include:: /includes/note-write-concern-journaled-replication.rst

.. _wc-wtimeout:

``wtimeout``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option specifies a time limit, in milliseconds, for the write
concern. This option causes write operations to return upon reaching
this limit, even if the required write concern has yet to be
fulfilled.

If you do not specify the ``wtimeout`` option and the level of write
concern is unachievable, the write operation will block indefinitely.
Specifying a ``wtimeout`` value of ``0`` is equivalent to a write
concern without the ``wtimeout`` option.
