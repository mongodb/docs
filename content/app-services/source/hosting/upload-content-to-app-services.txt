Overview
--------

You can upload content to App Services from the :guilabel:`Hosting` screen of
the App Services UI or by :ref:`importing
<deploy-cli>` an application directory that
includes the files. Select the tab below that corresponds to the method
you want to use.

Procedure
---------

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Navigate to the Hosting Configuration Page

            To open the hosting configuration page, click :guilabel:`Hosting` in
            the left navigation menu of the App Services UI.


         .. step:: Upload Files to Atlas App Services

            You can upload files to App Services individually or select multiple files
            or file directories to upload simultaneously. All files that you
            upload must be available on your local filesystem.

            There are two ways to upload files through the App Services UI. You can
            use either of the following methods:

            - Drag and drop files from your local filesystem on to the
              :guilabel:`Hosting` screen.

            - Click :guilabel:`Upload Files` and select the files you wish to
              upload from a file picker.

            Once you have dropped in or selected your files, App Services will begin
            uploading them immediately. The rate of upload time will vary depending
            on network connection speed and the number and size of the files
            selected.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      

      .. include:: /includes/enable-hosting-in-ui-note.rst
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Pull Your App's Latest Configuration Files

            .. code-block:: shell

               {+cli-bin+} pull --remote=<App ID>


         .. step:: Add a Hosting Directory

            App Services looks for files to upload in the ``/hosting/files``
            subdirectory of your application directory. If this directory doesn't
            already exist, create it:

            .. code-block:: shell

               mkdir -p hosting/files


         .. step:: Add a Metadata Configuration File

            To deploy hosted files through the {+cli-ref+} you must include a
            ``metadata.json`` file in the ``/hosting`` directory. If the
            configuration file does not exist, create it:

            .. code-block:: shell

               touch hosting/metadata.json

            The configuration does not need to specify metadata for any files but
            must be present. For more information, see :doc:`Configure File
            Metadata </hosting/configure-file-metadata>`.

            .. include:: /hosting/includes/metadata-config-json.rst

            .. note::

               If you include an entry in ``metadata.json`` for a file that does
               not exist, you will not be able to import your changes. The
               metadata.json must only have hosted files represented.


         .. step:: Add Files to the Hosting Directory

            To upload or edit files, add them to the ``/hosting/files``
            subdirectory of your application directory. When you import your
            application, App Services will map this subdirectory to the root of your
            application's hosted file tree.

            .. note::

               You can nest additional directories inside of the
               ``/hosting/files`` subdirectory. Nested directories are listed
               before a file's name in its resource path.


         .. step:: Upload the Files

            To upload files from the ``/hosting/files`` subdirectory, push your
            configuration directory with the ``--include-hosting`` flag:

            .. code-block:: shell

               {+cli-bin+} push --include-hosting

            .. note::

               The upload speed will vary depending on your network connection and the
               number and size of the files that you upload.
