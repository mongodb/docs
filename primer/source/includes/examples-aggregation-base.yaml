  Use the :pipeline:`$group` stage to group by a specified key. In the
  :pipeline:`$group` stage, specify the group by key in the ``_id``
  field. :pipeline:`$group` accesses fields by the field path, which is
  the field name prefixed by a dollar sign ``$``. The
  :pipeline:`$group` stage can use :manual:`accumulators
  </meta/aggregation-quick-reference/#group-operators>` to perform
  calculations for each group.

  The following example groups the documents in the ``restaurants``
  collection by the ``borough`` field and uses the :group:`$sum`
  accumulator to count the documents for each group.

  The result set consists of the following documents:

  The ``_id`` field contains the distinct ``borough`` value, i.e., the
  group by key value.

  Use the :pipeline:`$match` stage to filter documents.
  :pipeline:`$match` uses the MongoDB :doc:`query syntax
  </query>`.

  The following pipeline uses :pipeline:`$match` to query the
  ``restaurants`` collection for documents with ``borough`` equal to
  ``"Queens"`` and ``cuisine`` equal to ``Brazilian``.

  Then the :pipeline:`$group` stage groups the matching documents
  by the ``address.zipcode`` field and uses the :group:`$sum`
  accumulator to calculate the count. :pipeline:`$group` accesses
  fields by the field path, which is the field name prefixed by a
  dollar sign ``$``.
