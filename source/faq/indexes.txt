Should you run :dbcommand:`ensureIndex` after every insert?
-----------------------------------------------------------

No. An index needs to be created only once for a collection. After
initial creation, MongoDB automatically updates the index as data
changes.

Will building a large index affect database performance?
--------------------------------------------------------

Building an index can be an IO-intensive operation, especially if you
have a large collection. This is true on any database system that
supports secondary indexes, including MySQL. If you need to build an
index on a large collection, consider building the index in the
background. See :ref:`index-creation-operations`.

If you build a large index without the background option, and if doing
so causes the database to stop responding, you have two options:

- Wait for the index to finish building

- Kill the current operation (see :method:`db.killOp()`). The partial
  index will be deleted.

Using :operator:`$ne` and :operator:`$nin` in a query is slow. Why?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The :operator:`$ne` and :operator:`$nin` operators can match much of an
index. If you need to use these, it is often best to make sure that an
additional, more selective criterion is part of the query.
