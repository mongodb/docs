In examples of API authentication requests, and other examples where we
are teaching the use of the API and expect that users might copy the

account numbers, usernames, passwords, API keys, and so on. Format the
variables by using camelCase and italics, and also use bold within the
examples.

In example API operation requests and responses, in which we want users
to see actual values from the system, use "real-looking" values that
are nevertheless obviously made up, such the following one for
