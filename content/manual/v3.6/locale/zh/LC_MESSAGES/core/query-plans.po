"For each query, the query planner searches the query plan cache for an "
"entry that fits the :term:`query shape`. If there are no matching "

"documents."

"If a matching entry exists, the query planner generates a plan based on "
"that entry and evaluates its performance through a ``replanning`` "
"mechanism. This mechanism makes a ``pass/fail`` decision based on the "
"plan performance and either keeps or evicts the cache entry. On eviction,"
" the query planner selects a new plan using the normal planning process "
"and caches it. The query planner executes the plan and returns the result"
