=============
Using MongoDB
=============

These documents address application development with MongoDB. Most
applications interact with MongoDB using client libraries (drivers.)
The drivers provide language-specific interfaces to the database for
use in your applications. The :doc:`/applications/drivers` page
contains more information about the drivers themselves and links to
more through API-level documentation.

Beyond the drivers, you may also want to consider the documentation of
the :ref:`aggregation framework <aggregation-framework>` that
provides a more natural way to aggregate data with MongoDB. This
manual contains documentation of both :doc:`aggregation itself
</applications/aggregation>` and the :doc:`aggregation operators
</reference/aggregation>`.

Finally this section provides :ref:`introductory application
development tutorials using with Python and MongoDB
<applications-tutorials-python>`, that may help you as you begin to
develop applications with MongoDB. Also consider the
:ref:`administration tutorials <administration-tutorials>` that
provide an introduction to basic MongoDB use.

.. seealso:: ":wiki:`Developer Zone <Developer+Zone>`" wiki pages and
   the ":doc:`/faq/developers`" document. Developers also should be
   familiar with the :doc:`mongo` shell and the MongoDB :doc:`query
   and update operators </reference/operators>`.
