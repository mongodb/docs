IP Access List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To access a {+database-deployment+}, you must connect from an IP address on the
|service| project's IP access list. If you need to add an IP address to
the IP access list, you can do so in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog.
You can also add the IP address from the
:ref:`Network Access tab <add-to-access-list>`.
