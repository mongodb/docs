.. _swiftui-update-ui-when-objects-change:

Observe an Object
-----------------

The Swift SDK provides the :swift-sdk:`@ObservedRealmObject 
<Structs/ObservedRealmObject.html>` property wrapper that invalidates a view 
when an observed object changes. You can use this property wrapper to 
create a view that automatically updates itself when the observed object
changes.

   :language: swift

.. _swiftui-update-ui-when-query-results-change:

Observe Query Results
---------------------

The Swift SDK provides the :swift-sdk:`@ObservedResults <Structs/ObservedResults.html>`
property wrapper that lets you observe a collection of query results. You
can perform a quick write to an ObservedResults collection, and the view 
automatically updates itself when the observed query changes. For example,
you can remove a dog from an observed list of dogs using ``onDelete``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/PassObjectsToView.snippet.implicitly-open-realm-and-pass-objects.swift
   :language: swift

   For more information about the query syntax and types of queries that Realm
   supports, see: :ref:`Read - Swift SDK <swift-crud-read>` and :ref:`Filter 
   Data - Swift SDK <ios-filter-data>`.

Sort Observed Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :swift-sdk:`@ObservedResults <Structs/ObservedResults.html>`
property wrapper can take a :swift-sdk:`SortDescriptor 
<Structs/SortDescriptor.html>` parameter to sort the query results.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/FilterData.snippet.sort-descriptor.swift
   :language: swift

.. tip::

   You cannot use a computed property as a ``SortDescriptor`` for ``@ObservedResults``.

.. _swiftui-observe-sectioned-results:

Observe Sectioned Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.29.0

You can observe a results set that is divided into sections by a key 
generated from a property on the object. We've added a computed variable
to the model that we don't persist; we just use this to section the results
set.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/Model.snippet.computed-var-sectioned-results.swift
   :language: swift

Then, we can use the :swift-sdk:`@ObservedSectionedResults 
<Structs/ObservedSectionedResults.html>` property wrapper to 
observe the results set divided into sections based on the computed variable 
key.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/SectionedResults.snippet.observed-sectioned-results.swift
   :language: swift

You might use these observed sectioned results to populate a List view 
divided by sections:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/SectionedResults.snippet.sectioned-dogs-list-view.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swiftui-react-to-login-state-changes:

Observe App State
-----------------

If your app uses Atlas Device Sync, you can observe the :swift-sdk:`App 
<Extensions/App.html>` object to react to login state changes. This enables
your app to perform operations while it has an ``app.currentUser``, or direct 
the user to log in if there is no ``app.currentUser``. 

Because Realm caches user credentials on the device, your app can work 
offline while it has an ``app.currentUser``.
