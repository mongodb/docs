|mms| provides :term:`queryable backups <queryable backup>`. This
functionality allows you to more quickly query specific backup
snapsnots. You can use the queryable backups to:

- Restore a subset of data within the MongoDB deployment.

- Compare previous versions of data against the current data.

- Identify the best point in time to restore a system by comparing data
  from multiple snapshots.

Considerations
--------------

Read-Only Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/queryable-backup-duration.rst

Query Restrictions on the Queryable Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot perform the following operations on queryable snapshots:

- :manual:`Map-reduce operations </core/map-reduce>`.

- Queries that require disk usage, such as
  :manual:`running aggregation </reference/method/db.collection.aggregate>`
  with the ``allowDiskUse`` option to perform large sort
  operations.

.. cond:: cloud

   Cannot Query Snapshots on Encrypted Snapshots
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   If you :ref:`encrypted your snapshots <encrypt-snapshots>`, you
   cannot query those encrypted snapshots.

.. cond:: onprem

   Cannot Query Snapshots on Compressed File System Stores
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   If snapshots are :ref:`compressed <add-filestore>` in a
   :term:`file system store <File System Store>`,
   the snapshot contents cannot be queried.

   If you want to be able to query snapshots on a
   :term:`file system store <File System Store>`, you need to
   :ref:`create a new file system store <add-filestore>` with
   compression disabled.

Connection Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connections to these instances are over |tls-ssl|  and require
:manual:`x.509 authentication </core/security-x.509>`.  |mms| provides:

- An executable that creates a :ref:`tunnel <query-via-tunnel>` which
  handles the connection, including the client |tls-ssl| and the x.509
  authentication.

  .. cond:: onprem

     Requests are routed through the tunnel. The tunnel ensures that
     the request is speaking to the correct :program:`mongod` instance.

- x.509 certificates if you want to handle the connection details
  manually, including the |tls-ssl| and the x.509 authentication.

  .. cond:: onprem

     Requests come in through the web server, which acts as a proxy to
     the :program:`mongod`.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. cond:: onprem

   Encrypted Snapshot Support for Local Mode
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   You can query encrypted snapshot using |onprem|
   :doc:`local mode </tutorial/configure-local-mode>` if you
   run MongoDB Enterprise 4.2.9 or later.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/queryable-backup-prerequisites.rst

.. _query-via-tunnel:

Query Backup (Use Tunnel to Connect)
------------------------------------

.. note::

   The tunnel handles the security (|tls-ssl| and x.509 authentication)
   for connecting to the instance.

.. include:: /includes/steps/query-backup-tunnel.rst

.. tip::

   Once you have finished querying this snapshot, you can terminate the
   queryable instance:

   #. Go to the :guilabel:`Restore History` and hover over the
      :guilabel:`Status` column for the deployment item.

   #. Click :guilabel:`Cancel`.

.. cond:: onprem

   .. note::

      To find the log file for the queryable backup
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, navigate to the following path in
      the head directory of the :term:`Backup Daemon` host:

      .. code-block:: shell

         <daemon-hostname>:/<headDirectory>/queryable/<backupId>/mongod.log

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/warning/rotate-keys-with-aes256-gcm.rst

.. _query-via-manual-connection:

Query Backup (Handle |tls| Authentication Manually)
-------------------------------------------------------

.. note::

  .. include:: /includes/extracts/queryable-backup-certificate-duration.rst

.. include:: /includes/steps/query-backup-manual.rst

.. tip::

   Once you have finished querying this snapshot, you can terminate the
   queryable instance:

   #. Go to the :guilabel:`Restore History` and hover over the
      :guilabel:`Status` column for the deployment item.

   #. Click :guilabel:`Cancel`.
