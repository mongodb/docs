This guide shows you how to configure federated authentication 
using Okta as your |idp|.

After integrating Okta and |mms|, you can use your 
company's credentials to log in to |mms| and other MongoDB cloud 
services.

.. note::

   If you are using Okta's built-in MongoDB Cloud app, you can use
   `Okta's documentation
   <https://saml-doc.okta.com/SAML_Docs/How-to-Configure-SAML-2.0-for-MongoDB-Cloud.html>`__.

   If you are creating your own SAML app, use the procedures described here.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use Okta as an |idp| for |mms|, you must have:

- An `Okta account <https://www.okta.com/>`__.
- A custom, routable domain name.

Procedures
----------

Throughout the following procedure, it is helpful to have one browser
tab open to your :ref:`Federation Management Console
<mms-federated-authentication>` and one tab open to your Okta account.

Configure Okta as an Identity Provider

.. include:: /includes/associate-domain-map-org.rst

.. _okta-map-org:

(Optional) Map an Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :guilabel:`Federation Management Console` to assign your 
domain's users access to specific |mms| organizations:

.. include:: /includes/steps/manage-organization-mapping.rst

(Optional) Configure Advanced Federated Authentication Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the following advanced options for federated
authentication for greater control over your federated users and
authentication flow:

- :ref:`bypass-saml`

.. note::

   The following advanced options for federated authentication require
   you to :ref:`map an organization <okta-map-org>`.

- :ref:`advanced-option-default-role`
- :ref:`restrict-org-access-by-domain`
- :ref:`restrict-fed-user-membership`

Sign in to |mms| Using Your Login URL
-----------------------------------------

All users you assigned to the Okta application can log in to 
|mms| using their |idp-provider| credentials on the 
:guilabel:`Login URL`. Users have access to the organizations you 
mapped to your |idp|.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/use-alternate-idp-multiple-mapped-domains.rst

If you selected a default organization role, new users who log in to
|mms| using the :guilabel:`Login URL` have the role you specified.
