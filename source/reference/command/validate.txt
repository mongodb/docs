.. dbcommand:: validate

   The :dbcommand:`validate` command checks the structures within a
   namespace for correctness by scanning the collection's data and
   indexes. The command returns information regarding the on-disk
   representation of the collection.

   The ``validate`` command can be slow, particularly on larger data
   sets. While the ``validate`` command is running, it holds an
   exclusive lock on the collection.  This will block all reads and
   writes until the validate command finishes.

   :dbcommand:`validate` has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { validate: <collection> }

   You may also specify one of the following options:

   - ``full: true`` provides a more thorough scan of the data.

   - ``scandata: false`` skips the scan of the collection data
     without skipping scans of any indexes.

   The :program:`mongo` shell also provides a wrapper
   :method:`db.collection.validate()`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.validate();

Examples
--------

Use one of the following forms to validate a collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.validate()
   db.collection.validate(true)
   db.runCommand( { validate: "collection", full: true } )

.. note::

   Due to the manner in which :dbcommand:`validate` scans data
   structures, even a full collection validation cannot detect all
   forms of corruption on MMAPv1 storage engine data files.

Output
------

.. include:: /includes/note-output-may-vary.rst

:dbcommand:`validate` produces different output depending on which
:doc:`storage engine</core/storage-engines>` you are using. Specify
``{ full: true }`` for more detailed output.

The following fields are common to the
:doc:`MMAPv1</core/mmapv1>` and :doc:`WiredTiger</core/wiredtiger>`
storage engines:

.. data:: validate.ns

   The full namespace name of the collection. Namespaces include the
   database name and the collection name in the form
   ``database.collection``.

.. data:: validate.nrecords

   The number of :term:`documents <document>` in the collection.

.. data:: validate.nIndexes

   The number of indexes on the collection.

.. data:: validate.keysPerIndex

   A document containing a field for each index. The value for each
   field is the number of keys (or documents referenced) in the index.

.. data:: validate.valid

   A boolean that is ``true`` if :dbcommand:`validate` determines that
   all aspects of the collection are valid. When ``false``, see the
   :data:`~validate.errors` field for more information.

.. data:: validate.errors

   If the collection is not valid (i.e
   :data:`~validate.valid` is false), this field will contain a message
   describing the validation error.

.. data:: validate.ok

   An integer with the value ``1`` when the command succeeds. If the
   command fails the :data:`~validate.ok` field has a value of ``0``.

The following fields are specific to :doc:`MMAPv1</core/mmapv1>`:

.. data:: validate.firstExtent

   The disk location of the first extent in the collection. The value
   of this field also includes the namespace.

.. data:: validate.lastExtent

   The disk location of the last extent in the collection. The value
   of this field also includes the namespace.

.. data:: validate.extentCount

   The number of extents in the collection.

.. data:: validate.extents

   :dbcommand:`validate` returns one instance of this document for
   every extent in the collection. This embedded document is only returned
   when you specify the ``full`` option to the command.

   .. data:: validate.extents.loc

      The disk location for the beginning of this extent.

   .. data:: validate.extents.xnext

      The disk location for the extent following this one. "null" if
      this is the end of the linked list of extents.

   .. data:: validate.extents.xprev

      The disk location for the extent preceding this one. "null" if
      this is the head of the linked list of extents.

   .. data:: validate.extents.nsdiag

      The namespace this extent belongs to (should be the same as the
      namespace shown at the beginning of the validate listing).

   .. data:: validate.extents.size

      The number of bytes in this extent.

   .. data:: validate.extents.firstRecord

      The disk location of the first record in this extent.

   .. data:: validate.extents.lastRecord

      The disk location of the last record in this extent.

.. data:: validate.datasize

   The number of bytes in all data records.  This value does not
   include deleted records, nor does it include extent headers, nor
   record headers, nor space in a file unallocated to any
   extent. :data:`~validate.datasize` includes record :term:`padding`.

.. data:: validate.lastExtentSize

   The size of the last new extent created in this collection. This
   value determines the size of the *next* extent created.

.. data:: validate.padding

   A floating point value between 1 and 2.

   When MongoDB creates a new record it uses the :term:`padding
   factor` to determine how much additional space to add to the
   record. The padding factor is automatically adjusted by mongo when
   it notices that update operations are triggering record moves.

.. data:: validate.firstExtentDetails

   The size of the first extent created in this collection. This data
   is similar to the data provided by the :data:`~validate.extents`
   embedded document; however, the data reflects only the first extent in
   the collection and is always returned.

   .. data:: validate.firstExtentDetails.loc

      The disk location for the beginning of this extent.

   .. data:: validate.firstExtentDetails.xnext

      The disk location for the extent following this one. "null" if
      this is the end of the linked list of extents, which should only
      be the case if there is only one extent.

   .. data:: validate.firstExtentDetails.xprev

      The disk location for the extent preceding this one. This should
      always be "null."

   .. data:: validate.firstExtentDetails.nsdiag

      The namespace this extent belongs to (should be the same as the
      namespace shown at the beginning of the validate listing).

   .. data:: validate.firstExtentDetails.size

      The number of bytes in this extent.

   .. data:: validate.firstExtentDetails.firstRecord

      The disk location of the first record in this extent.

   .. data:: validate.firstExtentDetails.lastRecord

      The disk location of the last record in this extent.

.. data:: validate.objectsFound

   The number of records actually encountered in a scan of the
   collection. This field should have the same value as the
   :data:`~validate.nrecords` field.

.. data:: validate.invalidObjects

   The number of records containing BSON documents that do not pass a
   validation check.

   .. note::

      This field is only included in the validation output when you
      specify the ``full`` option.

.. data:: validate.bytesWithHeaders

   This is similar to datasize, except that :data:`~validate.bytesWithHeaders`
   includes the record headers. In version 2.0, record headers are 16
   bytes per document.

   .. note::

      This field is only included in the validation output when you
      specify the ``full`` option.

.. data:: validate.bytesWithoutHeaders

   :data:`~validate.bytesWithoutHeaders` returns data collected from a scan of
   all records. The value should be the same as :data:`~validate.datasize`.

   .. note::

      This field is only included in the validation output when you
      specify the ``full`` option.

.. data:: validate.deletedCount

   The number of deleted or "free" records in the collection.

.. data:: validate.deletedSize

   The size of all deleted or "free" records in the collection.
