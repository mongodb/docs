Configure Queryable Backups for |onprem| Resources

   :description: Configure queryable backups for Ops Manager resources in Kubernetes Operator to run queries on specific backup snapshots and manage them effectively.

You can configure :opsmgr:`queryable backups </tutorial/query-backup/>`
for |onprem| resources that you deploy in the |k8s-op-short|.

.. note:: In the |onprem| documentation, queryable backups are also
          referred to as queryable snapshots, or queryable restores.

Queryable backups allow you to :opsmgr:`run queries </tutorial/query-backup/#query-backup-handle-tls-authentication-manually>`
on specific backup snapsnots from your |onprem| resources. Querying |onprem|
backups helps you compare data from different snapshots and identify the
best snapshot to use for :opsmgr:`restoring data </tutorial/restore-single-database/#restore-from-queryable-backup>`.

In the following procedure you:

- Create the :opsmgr:`queryable.pem </reference/configuration/#brs.queryable.pem>`
  file that holds the certificates for accessing the backup snapshots that you intend to query.
- Create the secret containing the :opsmgr:`queryable.pem </reference/configuration/#brs.queryable.pem>` file.
- Configure an |onprem| custom resource to use the secret for queryable backups.
- Save the |onprem| custom resource configuration and apply it.

Once the |k8s-op-short| deploys the updated configuration for its custom
resource, |onprem| can read the secret from the :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.queryableBackupSecretRef.name`
parameter. You can now access the backup snapshots and run queries on them.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you configure queryable backups, complete the following tasks:

- :doc:`Install the Kubernetes Operator </tutorial/install-k8s-operator>`.

- :ref:`Deploy the Ops Manager application <deploy-om-container>`.

- :doc:`Configure Backup Settings for the Ops Manager Resource </tutorial/deploy-om-container>`.
  In the linked procedures, see the steps for configuring backups.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-om-queryable-backups.rst

After you configure queryable backups, you can :opsmgr:`query them </tutorial/query-backup/>`
to select the best backup snapshot to use for :opsmgr:`restoring data </tutorial/restore-single-database/#restore-from-queryable-backup>`.

Disable Queryable Backups
-------------------------

If you require all containers in your MongoDB deployment to be fully :ref:`static <static-containers>`, disable queryable backups as a best practice. This is so the :ref:`backup-daemon` doesn't attempt to download the MongoDB binaries 
from |onprem|. Downloading binaries undermines the immutable nature of static containers and is only 
possible with non-static containers. 
To learn more, see :ref:`static-containers`.
