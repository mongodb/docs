After you :ref:`set your secret storage tool <k8s-set-secret-storage-tool>` to
|hashicorp-vault|, you must also create secrets in |vault-short|. This applies
when you're manually migrating your existing |k8s| |k8s-secrets|
or you're creating secrets for the first time.

For a list of secrets that you must manually migrate to |vault-short|, see the
|vault-short| section of :ref:`Configure Secret Storage <k8s-set-secret-storage-tool>`.

The following tutorial stores your :ref:`Programmatic API Key 
<create-org-app-api-key>` in |vault-short|. You can adapt the commands in this
procedure to add other secrets to |vault-short| by changing the base path, the
namespace, and the secret name.

To learn more about |secret-stores|, see :ref:`Configure Secret Storage <k8s-set-secret-storage-tool>`.


Prerequisites
-------------

To create credentials for the |k8s-op-short| in |vault-short|, you must:

1. Have or create an |onprem|
   :opsmgr:`Organization </tutorial/manage-organizations>`.

#. Have or generate a
   :ref:`Programmatic API Key <create-org-app-api-key>`.

#. Grant this new |svc-api-key| the :authrole:`Project Owner` role.

#. Add the |ipaddr| or |cidr| block of any hosts that serve the
   |k8s-op-short| to the
   :opsmgr:`API Access List </tutorial/configure-public-api-access/>`.

#. Set up a |vault-short| instance and `enable Vault <https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2#setup>`__. 

   .. note::
      Ensure that |vault-short| is **not** running in `dev mode <https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/dev-server>`__ 
      and that your |vault-short| installation follows any applicable
      `configuration recommendations <https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/production-hardening>`__.
