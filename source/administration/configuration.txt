The :doc:`command line </reference/program/mongod>` and :doc:`configuration
file </reference/configuration-options>` interfaces provide MongoDB
administrators with a large number of options and settings for
controlling the operation of the database system. This document
provides an overview of common configurations and examples of
best-practice configurations for common use cases.

While both interfaces provide access to the same collection of options
and settings, this document primarily uses the configuration file
interface. If you run MongoDB using a :term:`init script` or if you installed
from a package for your operating system, you likely already have a
configuration file located at ``/etc/mongod.conf``. Confirm this by
checking the contents of the ``/etc/init.d/mongod`` or
``/etc/rc.d/mongod`` script to ensure that the init scripts start the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` with the appropriate configuration file.

To start a MongoDB instance using this configuration file, issue a
command in the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf
   mongod -f /etc/mongod.conf

Modify the values in the ``/etc/mongod.conf`` file on your system to
control the configuration of your database instance.

.. _base-config:

Configure the Database
----------------------

Consider the following basic configuration which uses the :doc:`YAML
format </reference/configuration-options>`:

.. code-block:: yaml

   processManagement:
      fork: true
   net:
      bindIp: 127.0.0.1
      port: 27017
   storage:
      dbPath: /srv/mongodb
   systemLog:
      destination: file
      path: "/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log"
      logAppend: true
   storage:
      journal:
         enabled: true

Or, if using the older ``.ini`` configuration file format:

.. code-block:: ini

   fork = true
   bind_ip = 127.0.0.1
   port = 27017
   quiet = true
   dbpath = /srv/mongodb
   logpath = /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
   logappend = true
   journal = true

For most standalone servers, this is a sufficient base
configuration. It makes several assumptions, but consider the
following explanation:

- :setting:`~processManagement.fork` is ``true``, which enables a
  :term:`daemon` mode for :binary:`~bin.mongod`, which detaches (i.e. "forks")
  the MongoDB from the current session and allows you to run the
  database as a conventional server.

- :setting:`~net.bindIp` is ``127.0.0.1``, which forces the
  server to only listen for requests on the localhost IP. Only bind to
  secure interfaces that the application-level systems can access with
  access control provided by system network filtering
  (i.e. ":term:`firewall`").

  .. |mongodb-package| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongod`

  .. include:: /includes/note-deb-and-rpm-default-to-localhost.rst

- :setting:`~net.port` is ``27017``, which is the default
  MongoDB port for database instances. MongoDB can bind to any
  port. You can also filter access based on port using network
  filtering tools.

  .. note::

     UNIX-like systems require superuser privileges to attach processes
     to ports lower than 1024.

- :setting:`~systemLog.quiet` is ``true``. This disables all but
  the most critical entries in output/log file, and is *not*
  recommended for production systems. If you do set this option, you
  can use :dbcommand:`setParameter` to modify this setting during
  run time.

- :setting:`~storage.dbPath` is ``/srv/mongodb``, which
  specifies where MongoDB will store its data files. ``/srv/mongodb``
  and ``/var/lib/mongodb`` are popular locations. The user account
  that :binary:`~bin.mongod` runs under will need read and write access to this
  directory.

- :setting:`systemLog.path` is ``/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log``
  which is where :binary:`~bin.mongod` will write its output. If you do not set
  this value, :binary:`~bin.mongod` writes all output to standard output
  (e.g. ``stdout``.)

- :setting:`~systemLog.logAppend` is ``true``, which ensures that
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` does not overwrite an existing log file
  following the server start operation.

- :setting:`storage.journal.enabled` is ``true``, which enables
  :term:`journaling <journal>`.  Journaling ensures single instance
  write-durability. 64-bit builds of :binary:`~bin.mongod` enable
  journaling by default. Thus, this setting may be redundant.

Given the default configuration, some of these values may be
redundant. However, in many situations explicitly stating the
configuration increases overall system intelligibility.

.. _configuration-security:

Security Considerations
-----------------------

The following collection of configuration options are useful for
limiting access to a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. Consider the following
settings, shown in both ``YAML`` and older configuration file format:

In :doc:`YAML format </reference/configuration-options>`

.. code-block:: yaml

   security:
      authorization: enabled
   net:
      bindIp: 127.0.0.1,10.8.0.10,192.168.4.24

Or, if using the older :v2.4:`older configuration file format
</reference/configuration-options>`:

.. code-block:: ini

   bind_ip = 127.0.0.1,10.8.0.10,192.168.4.24
   auth = true

Consider the following explanation for these configuration decisions:

- ":setting:`~net.bindIp`" has three values: ``127.0.0.1``, the localhost
  interface; ``10.8.0.10``, a private IP address typically used for
  local networks and VPN interfaces; and ``192.168.4.24``, a private
  network interface typically used for local networks.

  Because production MongoDB instances need to be accessible from
  multiple database servers, it is important to bind MongoDB to
  multiple interfaces that are accessible from your application
  servers. At the same time it's important to limit these interfaces
  to interfaces controlled and protected at the network layer.

- ":setting:`~security.authorization`" is ``true`` enables the authorization
  system within MongoDB. If enabled you will need to log in by
  connecting over the ``localhost`` interface for the first time to
  create user credentials.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/security`

Replication and Sharding Configuration
--------------------------------------

Replication Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Replica set` configuration is straightforward, and only
requires that the :setting:`~replication.replSetName` have a value that is consistent
among all members of the set. Consider the following:

In :doc:`YAML format </reference/configuration-options>`

.. code-block:: yaml

   replication:
      replSetName: set0

Or, if using the :v2.4:`older configuration file format
</reference/configuration-options>`:

.. code-block:: ini

   replSet = set0

Use descriptive names for sets. Once configured, use the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to add hosts to the replica set.

.. seealso::
   :ref:`Replica set reconfiguration
   <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`.

To enable authentication for the :term:`replica set`, add the
following :setting:`~security.keyFile` option:

In :doc:`YAML format </reference/configuration-options>`

.. code-block:: yaml

   security:
      keyFile: /srv/mongodb/keyfile

Or, if using the :v2.4:`older configuration file format
</reference/configuration-options>`:

.. code-block:: ini

   keyFile = /srv/mongodb/keyfile

Setting :setting:`~security.keyFile` enables authentication and specifies a key
file for the replica set member use to when authenticating to each
other. The content of the key file is arbitrary, but must be the same
on all members of the :term:`replica set` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances that connect to the set. The keyfile must be less than one
kilobyte in size and may only contain characters in the base64 set and
the file must not have group or "world" permissions on UNIX systems.

.. seealso::
   The :ref:`Replica Set Security <replica-set-security>` section for
   information on configuring authentication with replica sets.

   The :doc:`/replication` document for more information
   on replication in MongoDB and replica set configuration in general.

Sharding Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sharding requires :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances with different
:binary:`~bin.mongod` configurations for the :ref:`config servers
<sharded-cluster-config-server>` and the :doc:`shards
</core/sharded-cluster-shards>`. The config servers store the cluster's
metadata, while the shards store the data.

To configure the config server :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, in the
configuration file, specify ``configsvr`` for the
:setting:`sharding.clusterRole` setting.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

   Starting in MongoDB 3.2, config servers can be deployed as a replica
   set, and MongoDB deprecates the use of the mirrored config servers.
   See :doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set`.

.. code-block:: yaml

   sharding:
      clusterRole: configsvr
   net:
      bindIp: 10.8.0.12
      port: 27001
  replication:
      replSetName: csRS

To deploy config servers as a replica set, the config servers must run
the :ref:`storage-wiredtiger`. :method:`Initiate <rs.initiate()>` the
replica set and add members.

To configure the shard :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, specify
``shardsvr`` for the :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` setting:

.. code-block:: yaml

   sharding:
      clusterRole: shardsvr

Or, if using the :v2.4:`older configuration file format
</reference/configuration-options>`:

.. code-block:: ini

   shardsvr = true

For the router (i.e. :binary:`~bin.mongos`), configure at least one
:binary:`~bin.mongos` process with the following settings:

In :doc:`YAML format </reference/configuration-options>`:

.. code-block:: yaml

   sharding:
      configDB: csRS/10.8.0.12:27001
      chunkSize: 64

Or, if using the :v2.4:`older configuration file format
</reference/configuration-options>`:

.. code-block:: cfg

   configdb = csRS/10.8.0.12:27001
   chunkSize = 64

You can specify multiple config servers by specifying hostnames and
ports in the form of a comma separated list.

In general,
avoid modifying the :setting:`~sharding.chunkSize` from the default value of 64,
[#chunksize]_ and ensure this setting is consistent among all
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

.. [#chunksize] :term:`Chunk` size is 64 megabytes by default, which
   provides the ideal balance between the most even distribution of
   data, for which smaller chunk sizes are best, and minimizing chunk
   migration, for which larger chunk sizes are optimal.

.. seealso:: The :doc:`/sharding` section of the manual for more
   information on sharding and cluster configuration.

Run Multiple Database Instances on the Same System
--------------------------------------------------

In many cases running multiple instances of :binary:`~bin.mongod` on a
single system is not recommended. On some types of deployments
[#multimongod]_ and for testing purposes you may need to run more than
one :binary:`~bin.mongod` on a single system.

In these cases, use a :ref:`base configuration <base-config>` for each
instance, but consider the following configuration values:

In :doc:`YAML format </reference/configuration-options>`:

.. code-block:: yaml

   storage:
      dbPath: /srv/mongodb/db0/
   processManagement:
      pidFilePath: /srv/mongodb/db0.pid

Or, if using the :v2.4:`older configuration file format
</reference/configuration-options>`:

.. code-block:: cfg

   dbpath = /srv/mongodb/db0/
   pidfilepath = /srv/mongodb/db0.pid

The :setting:`~storage.dbPath` value controls the location of the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance's data directory. Ensure that each database
has a distinct and well labeled data directory. The
:setting:`~processManagement.pidFilePath` controls where :binary:`~bin.mongod` process
places it's :term:`process id <pid>` file. As this tracks the specific
:binary:`~bin.mongod` file, it is crucial that file be unique and well
labeled to make it easy to start and stop these processes.

Create additional :term:`init scripts <init script>` and/or
adjust your existing MongoDB configuration and init script as
needed to control these processes.

.. [#multimongod] Single-tenant systems with :term:`SSD` or other high
   performance disks may provide acceptable performance levels for
   multiple :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. Additionally, you may find that
   multiple databases with small working sets may function acceptably
   on a single system.

Diagnostic Configurations
-------------------------

The following configuration options control various :binary:`~bin.mongod`
behaviors for diagnostic purposes:

- :setting:`operationProfiling.mode` sets the :ref:`database profiler
  <database-profiling>` level. The profiler is not active by default
  because of the possible impact on the profiler itself on performance.
  Unless this setting is on, queries are not profiled.

- :setting:`operationProfiling.slowOpThresholdMs` configures the
  threshold which determines whether a query is "slow" for the purpose
  of the logging system and the :ref:`profiler <database-profiling>`.
  The default value is 100 milliseconds. Set a lower value if the
  database profiler does not return useful results or a higher value to
  only log the longest running queries.

- :setting:`systemLog.verbosity` controls the amount of logging output that
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` write to the log. Only use this option if you are
  experiencing an issue that is not reflected in the normal logging
  level.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0

     You can also specify verbosity level for specific components using
     the ``systemLog.component.<name>.verbosity`` setting. For the
     available components, see :setting:`component verbosity settings
     <systemLog.component.accessControl.verbosity>`.

For more information, see also :ref:`database-profiling` and
:doc:`/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance`.
