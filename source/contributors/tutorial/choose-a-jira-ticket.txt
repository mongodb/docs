JIRA is the system we use to track feature requests, bug reports and
other requested work. Each project has an associated JIRA project:

- `MongoDB Server JIRA Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER>`_
- `MongoDB Tools Jira Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/TOOLS>`_
- `C Driver JIRA Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CDRIVER>`_
- `C++ Driver JIRA Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CXX>`_
- `C# Driver JIRA Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP>`_
- `Java Driver JIRA Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/JAVA>`_
- `Node Driver JIRA Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE>`_
- `Perl Driver JIRA Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PERL>`_
- `PHP Driver JIRA Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PHP>`_
- `Python Driver JIRA Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON>`_
- `Ruby Driver JIRA Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/RUBY>`_
- `Scala Driver JIRA Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SCALA>`_
- `Hadoop Connector JIRA Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/HADOOP>`_

Guidelines for Choosing a Ticket
--------------------------------

Anyone can file a JIRA ticket, and some tickets may be vague,
underspecified, or out of date. Some tickets may be feature requests
that cannot or will not be implemented because the request may be
incompatible with planned changes or is a feature that would have a
greater negative impact than positive.

The following lists some guidelines to help you choose a ticket:

#. **Choose a ticket that is unassigned.**

#. **Do not choose a ticket with Fix Version "Features we're not sure of" or "Needs triage".**
   "Needs triage" is the default fix version for new tickets. Both of
   these versions indicate that we haven't decided how the ticket will
   fit into our roadmap.

#. **Aim for a ticket with Fix Version of the next version.** For
   example, if the current stable release is 2.6, you want to aim for
   something in the "2.7 desired" fix version.

#. **Choose a ticket with detailed and specific description.**
   A more thorough specification improves your chances of implementing
   the changes in a non-breaking way.

#. **Avoid tickets with debates over the implementation details in the comments.**
   Approvals are less likely for changes based on a controversial tickets.

#. **Look for tickets without any or fewer cross-dependencies.**
   A ticket that has numerous links to other tickets, depends on other
   tickets, or have other tickets depend upon it require more research
   and can be difficult to implement correctly without being in close
   contact with the persons implementing the others tickets.

   If you're just starting out, try to pick a ticket that has fewer
   cross-dependencies.

#. **Verify approval of New Feature requests.**
   To avoid `feature creep
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep>`_, requests for New
   Feature undergo a review and approval process. If choosing a New
   Feature request ticket, verify that we have approved the request.

Scope Consideration
-------------------

It is important to keep your changes to the scope of the JIRA ticket.
This helps us accurately track changes.

For instance, do not correct typos or trailing whitespace or anything
else outside of the scope of the ticket. If your IDE of choice has
auto-formatting, turn that feature off.

If you go outside the scope of the ticket, your changes are unlikely to
be merged.

SERVER-Specific JIRA FAQs
-------------------------

- What do the JIRA ticket Fix version numbers mean?
    A `server roadmap/master plan
    <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER#selectedTab=com.atlassian.j
    ira.plugin.system.project%3Aroadmap-panel>`_ covers all the tickets
    that have undergone comprehensive review.

    We break down specific versions into subcategories. Ordered
    from most to least pressing, these are:

    #. <Version> Desired (for whichever is due out next, e.g. 2.7.)

    #. Planning Bucket A

    #. Planning Bucket B

    #. Planning Bucket C

    #. Planned But Not Scheduled

    #. Features We're Not Sure Of

- What does the `#neweng label <https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=labels+%3D+neweng>`_ mean?
    This label exists for tickets that we think are a good entry point
    for engineers who are new to the codebase. The tickets are small in
    scope, provide a good learning experience, and/or are otherwise
    appropriate for a new server contributor.

- Is there any way to get feedback on the ticket I picked?
    Yes. Once you have picked a ticket, you can email the `mongodb-dev
    mailing list
    <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mongodb-dev>`_ to get
    feedback on your chosen ticket. This mailing list is specifically
    for anyone interested in contributing to the database or building
    third party tools around and is a great resource for feedback
    throughout the process of contributing to the server.
