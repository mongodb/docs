Install or Upgrade the On-Prem MMS Service: tar.gz and zip
==========================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| is a service to monitor and back up a MongoDB infrastructure. This
tutorial describes the basic process to install and configure the service.

At a high level, a basic installation will look like the following.
The estimated setup time is less than an hour.

#. Install a standalone local MongoDB server backed by a fast, large storage volume.

#. Install an SMTP email server as appropriate for your environment.

#. Install the MMS server RPM package.

#. Configure the MMS server's URL and email addresses.

#. Start up MMS server.

Links to configure the MMS application and start MMS are at the bottom of
this tutorial.

Prerequisites
-------------

Contact a MongoDB representative to obtain the current stable |monitoring|
release. MMS is available in DEB packages for Debian, Ubuntu, and related
systems; RPM for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, and related
systems; as well as ``tar.gz`` and ``zip`` packages.

You can also download the latest On-Prem Monitoring releases from
<http://www.mongodb.com/commercialsupport/downloads> as an RPM package.

Confirm your environment meets the :doc:`/management/requirements`.

Procedures
----------

Install and Start MongoDB System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the :manual:`MongoDB Installation tutorials </installation>` for
complete instructions on this procedure.

Install the MMS Software Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install |monitoring| from the provided ``tar.gz`` or ``zip``
archive without making any changes to the underlying system
(i.e. without creating users.)  To install, extract the package, as in
the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    tar -zxf mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.tar.gz

Optionally create a symlink in ``/etc/init.d`` to the included control
script for convenience, as in the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo ln -s <install_dir>/bin/mongodb-mms /etc/init.d/

Note, when the app is first started, it will create and store an encryption
key in ``$HOME/.mongodb-mms`` for the app user.

Update the MMS Software Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upgrade |mms| from 1.2 and Earlier
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Due to the `company name change
<http://www.mongodb.com/press/10gen-announces-company-name-change-mongodb-i
nc>`_, the name of the MMS package changed between versions 1.2 and 1.3.
Therefore, to upgrade the |mms| server from *any* version before 1.3, use
the following procedure:

#. *Recommended.* Take a full backup of the MMS database before
   beginning the upgrade procedure.

#. Shut down MMS, using the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      /etc/init.d/10gen-mms stop

#. Download the latest package and proceed with the instructions
   for a fresh install. Do not attempt to use your package manager
   to do an upgrade. See
   :doc:`/monitoring/tutorial/install-monitoring-server` for more
   information.

   When complete, |mms| is installed in the ``/opt/mongodb/mms``
   directory.

#. Follow all procedures for a new install include configuring the
   options in ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties``. If you
   used encrypted authentication credentials you will need to
   regenerate these manually.  *Do not copy the credentials from
   your old properties file. Old credentials will not work.*

#. Start MMS  using the new package name:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms start

#. Update any Monitoring Agent. See :ref:`upgrade-mms-agent` for
   more information.

Upgrading a ``tgz``/``zip`` Installation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To upgrade a tarball installation, backup configuration and/or logs,
and then re-install the On-Prem MMS server.

.. important:: It is crucial that you back up the existing
   configuration because the upgrade process will delete existing
   data.

In more details:

#. Shutdown the MMS server and take a backup of your existing
   configuration and logs.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms stop
      sudo cp -a <install_dir>/conf ~/mms_conf.backup
      sudo cp -a <install_dir>/logs ~/mms_logs.backup

#. Remove your existing MMS server installation entirely and extract
   latest release in its place:

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd <install_dir>/../
      sudo rm -rf <install_dir>
      sudo tar -zxf -C . /path/to/10gen-mms-<version>.x86_64.tar.gz

#. Compare and reconcile any changes in configuration between versions:

   .. code-block:: sh

      diff -u ~/mms_conf.backup/conf-mms.properties <install_dir>/conf/conf-mms.properties
      diff -u ~/mms_conf.backup/mms.conf <install_dir>/conf/mms.conf

#. Edit your configuration to resolve any conflicts between the old
   and new versions, being sure to take any new changes as
   appropriate.

   .. note::

      Changes to ``mms.centralUri``, email addresses, and MongoDB are
      the most common configuration changes.

#. Restart the On-Prem MMS server.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms start

.. include:: /includes/mms-install-next-steps.rst
