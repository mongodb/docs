|service| {+Cloud-Backup+}s provide localized backup storage using the
native snapshot functionality of the cluster's cloud service provider.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/notes/backup-roles.rst

|service| supports {+cloud-backup+} for clusters served on:

- :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`
- :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
- :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`

You can enable {+cloud-backup+} during the
:doc:`cluster creation </tutorial/create-new-cluster>` or during the
:doc:`modification of an existing cluster </scale-cluster>`.
From the cluster configuration modal, toggle
:guilabel:`Turn on Cloud Backup` to :guilabel:`Yes`.

If you need to retain any {+old-backup+} snapshots for archival
purposes, download them before you switch to {+Cloud-Backup+} from
{+old-backup+}s. To learn how to download a snapshot, see
:doc:`/backup/legacy-backup/restore`.

When you change from {+Old-Backup+}s to {+Cloud-Backup+}s, |service| retains
your {+Old-Backup+} snapshots in accordance with your
:ref:`legacy backup retention policy <retention-policy>`.

.. important:: Limitations of {+Cloud-Backup+}

   {+Cloud-Backup+}s:

   - Can support sharded clusters running MongoDB version 4.0 or later.

   - Cannot restore an existing snapshot to a cluster after you add or
     remove a shard from it. You may restore an existing snapshot to
     another cluster with a matching topology.

.. note:: Sharded Cluster Balancer, FCV 4.0 databases and {+Cloud-Backup+}

   With databases running |fcv-link| 4.0 or earlier, {+Cloud-Backup+}
   automatically disables the balancer for snapshots if it's running.
   This ensures an inactive balancer during the backup operation. When
   the snapshot completes, {+Cloud-Backup+} returns the balancer to its
   previous state.
