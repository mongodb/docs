   .. important::

      Once you automate sharding, the {+aagent+} reverts
      any configuration changes not made through the |mms| interface.

      The {+aagent+} does not change anything in sharded
      collections that are not managed through |mms|.

title: "For each shard key, enter the minimum and maximum values and select the associated zone."

ref: set-data-range

   Compound shard keys have one range per component shard key but
   together are associated with only one zone.

   .. note::
   
      If your shard key is a compound shard key with a hashed field, 
      valid range value types for the hashed field are: 

      - ``NumberLong``
      - ``minKey``
      - ``maxKey``

   A range's minimum value is inclusive and the maximum value is
   exclusive.

   .. example::

      The following two ranges do not overlap:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 33,33,33

         * - min
           - max
           - zone
         * - 1
           - 10
           - A
         * - 10
           - 20
           - B

   .. note::
      :guilabel:`Min` and :guilabel:`Max` are absolute values: the
      absolute minimum and maximum value of any range without
      explicitly listing a specific value.

   Each range can be associated only to a single zone. You cannot assign
   the same range to more than one zone.

   You can add additional shard key ranges for the given collection.

   You cannot assign the same range to another zone in this manner.
