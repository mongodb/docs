   :description: Deploy a sharded cluster with Ops Manager for horizontal scaling and high throughput, configuring settings for shards, replica sets, and MongoDB processes.

:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` provide horizontal scaling
for large data sets and enable high throughput operations by
distributing the data set across a group of servers.

To learn more about sharding, see
:manual:`Sharding Introduction </core/sharding-introduction>` in the
MongoDB manual.

Use this procedure to deploy a new sharded cluster that |mms| manages.
Later, you can use |mms| to add shards and perform other maintenance
operations on the cluster.

.. note:: Use |k8s| to deploy |onprem|

   You can use |k8s| to deploy MongoDB instances with
   |onprem| version 6.0 or later.

Considerations
--------------

Unique Names for Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use unique names for the new cluster and its shards.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/consideration-k8s-monitoring-agent.rst

Configuration Server Deployment Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   For MongoDB 6.0 and later versions of configuration server |mongod| processes, |mms|
   deploys configuration servers as a replica set.

To learn more about |csrs| and mirrored configuration servers (|sccc|),
see :manual:`Config Servers </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers/>`.
