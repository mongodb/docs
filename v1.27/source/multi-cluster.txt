   :description: Deploy MongoDB replica sets that span two or more Kubernetes clusters in a single region across more than one zone, or in more than one region and zone.

.. important::

   You can deploy |k8s-op-full| to manage MongoDB deployments that span two
   or more |k8s| clusters. The |k8s-op-short| supports deploying only
   replica sets across two or more |k8s| clusters. Deploying sharded
   clusters across two or more |k8s| clusters is not supported.

:ref:`multi-cluster-overview-ref`
  Learn about |multi-clusters|.

:ref:`multi-cluster-arch-ref`
  Learn about the |multi-cluster| architecture, capabilities, and
  limitations, and view the deployment's diagram.

:ref:`multi-cluster-services-tools-ref`
  Review the list of services and tools used in this quick start.

:ref:`multi-cluster-prereqs`
  Set up |gke| clusters, install tools, set the deployment's scope,
  install the |kubectl-mongodb| and check connectivity across member clusters.

:ref:`multi-cluster-quick-start-ref`
  Deploy a MongoDB replica set across three |k8s| member clusters, using
  |gke| and a service mesh.

:ref:`multi-cluster-deploy-replica-set`
  Deploy a |mongodb-multi| as a replica set with a service mesh.

:ref:`multi-cluster-no-service-mesh-deploy-rs`
  Deploy a |mongodb-multi| as a replica set without a service mesh.

:ref:`multi-cluster-edit-replica-set`
  Modify the configuration of a |mongodb-multi|.

:ref:`multi-cluster-secure-ref`
  Secure client connections in |multi-clusters|.

:ref:`multi-cluster-connect-ref`
  Connect to a |mongodb-multi|.

:ref:`disaster-recovery-ref`
  Set a disaster recovery mode for your |multi-cluster|.

:ref:`multi-cluster-troubleshooting`
  Troubleshoot your |multi-clusters|.

:ref:`kubectl-plugin-ref`
