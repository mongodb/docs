Behavior
--------

Expanded Event Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionchanged:: 6.0

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, when the :ref:`showExpandedEvents
<change-streams-expanded-events>` option is set to ``true`` for the change 
stream, the ``rename`` event includes an ``operationDescription`` document.
This document provides a ``to`` field showing the changed database and
collection and a ``dropTarget`` field indicating whether the ``rename``
operation removed the collection before the rename.


Example
-------

The following example illustrates a ``rename`` event:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
      "_id": { <Resume Token> },
      "operationType": "rename",
      "clusterTime": <Timestamp>,
      "wallTime": <ISODate>,
      "ns": {
         "db": "engineering",
         "coll": "users"
      },
      "to": {
         "db": "engineering",
         "coll": "people"
      },
      "operationDescription": {
         "to": {
            "db": "engineering",
            "coll": "people"
         }
      }
   }

A ``rename`` event leads to an
:ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>` for change streams opened
against its ``ns`` collection or ``to`` collection.
