.. pipeline:: $searchMeta

The :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage returns different :ref:`types of 
metadata result <fts-metadata-results>` documents. 

.. note:: 

   To run :pipeline:`$searchMeta` queries over sharded collections, 
   your cluster must run MongoDB v6.0 or later.

Syntax 
------

A ``$searchMeta`` pipeline stage has the following prototype form: 

.. code-block:: json

   {
     $searchMeta: {
       "index": "<index-name>",
       "<collector-name>"|"<operator-name>": {
         <collector-specification>|<operator-specification>
       },
       "count": {
         <count-options>
       }
     }
   }
  
Fields
------

The ``$searchMeta`` stage takes a document with the following fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 15 15 70

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description

   * - ``<collector-name>``
     - object 
     - Conditional
     - Name of the :ref:`collector <collectors-ref>` to use with the 
       query. You can provide a document that contains the 
       collector-specific options as the value for this field. Value 
       must be ``facet`` to retrieve a mapping of the defined facet 
       names to an array of buckets for that facet. To learn more, see  
       :ref:`fts-facet-ref`. You must specify this or 
       ``<operator-name>``.

   * - ``count``
     - object 
     - Optional
     - Document that specifies the :ref:`count <count-ref>` options for 
       retrieving a count of the results. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`count-ref`.

   * - ``index`` 
     - string 
     - Optional 
     - Name of the |fts| index to use. If omitted, defaults to 
       ``default``. 
       
       |fts| doesn't return results if you misspell the index name or 
       if the specified index doesn't already exist on the cluster.

   * - ``<operator-name>``
     - object 
     - Conditional
     - Name of the :ref:`operator <operators-ref>` to search with. You 
       can provide a document that contains the operator-specific 
       options as the value for this field. You must specify 
       this or ``<collector-name>``. :pipeline:`$searchMeta` 
       returns the default ``count`` metadata only.

Behavior
--------

The :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage must be the first stage in any 
pipeline.

.. _fts-metadata-results:

Metadata Result Types 
---------------------

The structure of the metadata results document that is returned by 
the :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage varies based on the type of 
results. |fts| supports the following result types:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1 
   :widths: 20 80
   
   * - Type
     - Result Structure

   * - ``count``
     - The count result included in the results indicate whether the 
       count returned in the results is a total count of the search 
       results, or a lower bound. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`count-results`.

   * - ``facet``
     - The result to a facet query is a mapping of the defined facet 
       names to an array of buckets for that facet. To learn more, 
       see :ref:`fts-facet-results`.

Example
-------

Suppose the following index on the ``sample_mflix.movies`` 
collection.

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true

   {
     "mappings": {
       "dynamic": false,
       "fields": {
         "year": {
           "type": "number"
         }
       }
     }
   }

The following query searches for the number of movies released in 1998
using the :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: json

      db.movies.aggregate([
        {
          "$searchMeta": {
            "range": {
              "path": "year",
              "gte": 1998,
              "lt": 1999
            },
            "count": {
              "type": "total"
            }
          }
        }
      ])

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: true
      
      [ { count: { total: Long("552") } } ]
