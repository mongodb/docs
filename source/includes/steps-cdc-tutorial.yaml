  Once you have cloned the repository, switch to the

title: Set Up the Environment
ref: cdc-tutorial-set-up-environment
content: |
  The sample pipeline consists of the following tools running in Docker
  containers on your computer:

  - A MongoDB replica set
  - An Apache Kafka instance
  - A Kafka Connect instance with the MongoDB Kafka Connector installed
  - A Zookeeper instance (Zookeeper is a dependency of Apache Kafka)

  The pipeline comes with a source connector already installed. The source
  connector writes change event documents corresponding to the ``Source``
  collection in the ``CDCTutorial`` database to a Kafka topic. The configuration
  for the source connector is as follows:
  <TODO: Link to Source - Fundamentals - Change Streams page>
    
  .. code-block:: properties
     :copyable: false

     name="mongo-source-CDCTutorial-eventroundtrip"
     connector.class="com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSourceConnector"
     connection.uri="mongodb://mongo1:27017,mongo2:27017,mongo3:27017"
     database="CDCTutorial"
     collection="Source"

  To download and start the pipeline, execute the following command from
  within the root directory of your cloned repository:

  .. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose -p cdc-tutorial up -d

  .. include:: /includes/tutorials/download-note.rst

  Once the preceding command finishes and the pipeline starts, you should see
  output that looks like this:

  .. code-block:: text
     :copyable: false

     ...
     Creating mongo1    ... done
     Creating mongo1    ... done
     Creating zookeeper ... done
     Creating broker       ... done
     Creating mongo1-setup ... done
     Creating connect      ... done
     Creating shell        ... done

  Open a second terminal window. You will use one
  terminal to monitor your topic, and the other terminal to perform write
  operations on your database. Enter the following command into both terminals:

  .. code-block:: bash

     docker exec -it shell /bin/bash

  Once you have entered the preceding command into both terminal windows, your
  terminals should look like:

  .. figure:: /includes/figures/two-shells-after.png
     :alt: Arrangement of two shells for this tutorial.

  Arrange your two terminal windows to match the preceding image so that
  both are visible and one is above the other. 

  To monitor your topic, type the following command in your upper terminal window:

  .. code-block:: bash

     kafkacat -b broker:29092 -C -t CDCTutorial.Source

  .. important:: Broker Leader Not Available

     If you receive the following output, run the preceding ``kafkacat`` command
     a second time: 

     .. code-block::
        :copyable: false

        % Error: Topic CDCTutorial.Source error: Broker: Leader not available

  Once you enter the preceding command, you should see output that looks like
  this:

  .. code-block:: text
     :copyable: false

     % Reached end of topic CDCTutorial.Source [0] at offset 0

  Your upper terminal window is now listening to the ``CDCTutorial.Source`` Kafka
  topic. Changes to your topic will print in this terminal window.

title: Configure Sink Connector
ref: cdc-tutorial-configure-sink
content: |
  To configure your sink connector, execute the following command in your lower
  terminal window:

  .. code-block:: bash

     curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '
     { "name": "mongo-sink-CDCTutorial-eventroundtrip", 
       "config": {
       "connector.class":"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSinkConnector",
       "tasks.max":"1",
       "topics":"CDCTutorial.Source",
       "change.data.capture.handler":"com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.cdc.mongodb.ChangeStreamHandler",
       "connection.uri":"mongodb://mongo1:27017,mongo2:27017,mongo3:27017",
       "database":"CDCTutorial",
       "collection":"Destination"}
     }' http://connect:8083/connectors -w "\n" | jq .

  After you run the preceding command, you should see the following output:

  .. code-block:: json

     ...
     {
       "name": "mongo-sink-CDCTutorial-eventroundtrip",
       "config": {
        "connector.class": "com.mongodb.kafka.connect.MongoSinkConnector",
        "tasks.max": "1",
        "topics": "CDCTutorial.Source",
        "change.data.capture.handler": "com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.cdc.mongodb.ChangeStreamHandler",
        "connection.uri": "mongodb://mongo1:27017,mongo2:27017,mongo3:27017",
        "database": "CDCTutorial",
        "collection": "Destination",
        "name": "mongo-sink-CDCTutorial-eventroundtrip"
       },
       "tasks": [],
       "type": "sink"
     }

  This configuration makes your sink connector do the following things:

  - Listen for events on the ``CDCTutorial.Source`` topic
  - Apply a change data capture handler to documents it receives from the
    ``Tutorial.Source`` topic
  - Write received documents to the ``Destination`` collection in the
    ``CDCTutorial`` database

title: Change Data in MongoDB
ref: cdc-tutorial-change-data
content: |
  From your lower terminal, enter the 
  `MongoDB Shell <https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/>`__
  with the following command:

  .. code-block:: bash

     mongosh mongodb://mongo1:27017/?replicaSet=rs0

  Once you are in the MongoDB Shell, your terminal prompt should look like this:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :copyable: false

     rs0 [primary] test> 

  Insert a document into the ``Source`` collection of the ``CDCTutorial`` database
  with the following commands:

  .. code-block :: javascript

     use CDCTutorial
     db.Source.insert({proclaim: "Hello World!"});

  Once you insert the document, you should see output that resembles the following
  in your upper shell:
    
  .. code-block:: bash
     :copyable: false

     {"schema":{"type":"string","optional":false},
     "payload":{"_id": {"_data": "8260...4"}, 
     "operationType": "insert", 
     "clusterTime": {"$timestamp": {"t": 1611348141, "i": 2}},
     "fullDocument": {"_id": {"$oid": "600b38ad..."}, "proclaim": "Hello World!"},
     "ns": {"db": "CDCTutorial", "coll": "Source"},
     "documentKey": {"_id": {"$oid": "600b38a...."}}}}

  In your lower shell, inspect the ``Destination`` collection with the following
  command:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.Destination.find()

  You should see output that looks like this:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :copyable: false

     { _id: ..., proclaim: 'Hello World!' }

  Try deleting your document from your ``Source`` collection with the following
  command:
    
  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.Source.deleteMany({})

  Once you delete the document, you should see output that resembles the following
  in your upper shell:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :copyable: false

     {"schema":{"type":"string","optional":false},"payload":"{\"_id\":
     {\"_data\": \"826138BCBA000000012B022C0100296E5A10041FD232D9ECE347FFABA837E9AB05D95046645F696400646138BCAF2A52D9E0D299336F0004\"},
     \"operationType\": \"delete\", \"clusterTime\": {\"$timestamp\": {\"t\":
     1631108282, \"i\": 1}}, \"ns\": {\"db\": \"CDCTutorial\", \"coll\":
     \"Source\"}, \"documentKey\": {\"_id\": {\"$oid\":
     \"6138bcaf2a52d9e0d299336f\"}}}"}

  Now see how many documents are in your ``Destination`` collection:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.Destination.count()

  You should see the following output:

  .. code-block:: text
     :copyable: false

     0

  Once you have finished exploring the connector in the MongoDB shell, you can
  exit the MongoDB shell with the following command:

  .. code-block:: bash

     exit

  Try and explore the CDC handler on your own. Here are some challenges to get
  you started:

  - Add a second source connector that writes to the ``CDCTutorial.Source``
    topic. Use a pipeline to have this connector only write insert events.
  - Remove the ``change.data.capture.handler`` from your sink connector. What
    do your documents look like?
  - Use ``kafkacat`` to upload a message to the ``CDCTutorial.Source`` topic
    that isn't a MongoDB Change Event document. What happens?

  <TODO: Link to relevant docs sections from the explore list above >

title: Stop the Pipeline
ref: cdc-tutorial-stop-pipeline
content: |
  To conserve resources on your computer, make sure to stop the sample pipeline
  once you are done exploring this example.

  Before you stop the sample pipeline, make sure to exit your Docker shell.
  You can exit your Docker shell by running the following command in your lower
  terminal:

  .. code-block:: bash

     exit

  To stop the sample pipeline and remove containers and images, run the following command:

  .. code-block:: bash

     docker-compose -p cdc-tutorial down --rmi 'all'
