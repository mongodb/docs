As an organization owner, you can set up your |service| organization
so that MongoDB Production Support Employees, including Technical
Service Engineers, can only access your production servers with your
explicit permission. If an issue that requires MongoDB Support arises 
and you want to grant 24-hour temporary infrastructure access to 
MongoDB Support, you can grant access at the {+database-deployments+} 
level. Granting temporary access doesn't give MongoDB Support access to 
read your database, only the underlying MongoDB and Atlas Search
infrastructure, which should exclude :ref:`sensitive information
<sensitive-info>`. You can also revoke temporary infrastructure access
at any time prior to the automatic 24-hour expiration. Additionally, you
can view who accessed your database logs or {+cluster+} in your
:ref:`Activity Feed <view-activity-feed>`.

Block Access at the Organization Level
-----------------------------------------

You must be an organization owner to adjust this setting.

Grant Infrastructure Access to MongoDB Support for 24 hours
-----------------------------------------------------------

If an issue that requires MongoDB Support arises and you want to allow 
MongoDB support
staff limited-time access to a {+database-deployment+} 
within your organization,
you can do so with the following procedure.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      To grant limited-time access to MongoDB support staff to a {+database-deployment+} through 
      the {+atlas-admin-api+}, see :oas-atlas-op:`Grant MongoDB employee cluster access for one cluster </grantMongoDBEmployeeAccess>`.

      You can specify ``CLUSTER_INFRASTRUCTURE`` for the ``grantType`` field in the request body schema.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/steps-grant-support-access-bypass.rst

Grant Access to MongoDB Support Only for Database Logs
------------------------------------------------------

If an issue that requires MongoDB Support arises and you want to allow 
MongoDB support staff limited-time access only to database logs within 
your organization, you can do so with the following procedure.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      To grant access to MongoDB support staff to database logs through 
      the {+atlas-admin-api+}, see :oas-atlas-op:`Grant MongoDB employee cluster access for one cluster </grantMongoDBEmployeeAccess>`.

      You can specify ``CLUSTER_DATABASE_LOGS`` for the ``grantType`` field in the request body schema.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/steps-grant-support-access-only-to-database-logs.rst

Revoke Temporary Infrastructure Access to MongoDB Support
---------------------------------------------------------

If you want to revoke access to a {+database-deployment+} 
within your organization that has been granted 
24-hour temporary infrastructure access,
you can do so with the following procedure.

.. important:: 
   
   Temporary infrastructure access that is not revoked will automatically
   expire at the end of 24 hours. |service| displays a timer indicating 
   the amount of time left before 24-hour temporary infrastructure access expires.
   
.. include:: /includes/steps-revoke-support-access-bypass.rst

To revoke 24-hour temporary infrastructure access from MongoDB support staff 
through the {+atlas-admin-api+}, see :oas-atlas-op:`Revoke granted MongoDB employee 
cluster access for one cluster </revokeMongoDBEmployeeAccess>`.

Access Transparency Employee Identifiers
----------------------------------------

You can monitor certain actions on your infrastructure with an
anonymized :guilabel:`Employee Identifier`, which you can view in each
:ref:`Activity Feed <view-activity-feed>` entry related to accessing
your infrastructure.

Each :guilabel:`Employee Identifier`:

- Starts with ``mongodb-employee`` and ends with a few digits.
- Is unique for each organization and MongoDB employee.
- Lasts for 30 days before |service| automatically replaces it with a new identifier.
- Consists of a unique value that |service| does not reuse for at least
  365 days from the day |service| creates it.

.. note::

   If you have questions about employee access to your {+cluster+}
   infrastructure or logs, contact |mdb-support|.
