Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: killOp

   Terminates an operation as specified by the operation ID.
   The :program:`mongo` shell provides the 
   :method:`db.killOp()` helper.
   To find operations and their corresponding IDs,
   see :method:`db.currentOp()`.
   
   .. |command| replace:: killOp

   The ``killOp`` command must be run against the ``admin`` database.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand.rst

   The command has the following form:

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { 
         "killOp": 1,
         "op": <opid>,
         txnNumber: <long>,   // Set by the 3.6 drivers and mongo shell
         lsid: { id: <UUID> } // Set by the 3.6 drivers and mongo shell
      }

Access Control
--------------

On systems running with :setting:`~security.authorization`, to kill
operations not owned by the user, the user must have access that
includes the :authaction:`killop` privilege action.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2.9
   On :program:`mongod` instances, users can kill their own operations
   even without the :authaction:`killop` privilege action.

Example
-------

The following example uses :dbcommand:`killOp` to target
the running operation with opid ``3478``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { "killOp": 1, "op": 3478 } )

The operation returns the following result:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "info" : "attempting to kill op", "ok" : 1 }

:dbcommand:`killOp` only confirms its attempt to end the
specified operation. Use :method:`db.currentOp()` to confirm the
target operation was terminated.
