Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+}
to run a database command. You can use database commands to perform a
variety of administrative and diagnostic tasks, such as fetching server
statistics, initializing a replica set, or running an aggregation pipeline.

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Execute a Command <rust-execute-command>` describes the syntax
  and behavior of the ``run_command()`` method

- :ref:`Response <rust-command-response>` describes the information
  that the ``run_command()`` method returns

- :ref:`Command Example <rust-command-example>` provides a command
  example and describes the output for the command

- :ref:`Additional Information <rust-addtl-info-runcommand>`
  provides links to resources and API documentation for types
  and methods mentioned in this guide

.. important:: Prefer Driver Methods to Database Commands

   The driver provides wrapper methods for many database commands.
   We recommend using driver methods instead of executing database
   commands when possible.
   
   To perform administrative tasks, use the :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell </>`
   instead of the {+driver-short+}. Calling the ``db.runCommand()``
   method inside the shell is the preferred way to issue database
   commands, as it provides a consistent interface between the shell and
   drivers.

.. _rust-execute-command:

Execute a Command
-----------------

To run a database command, you must specify the command and any relevant
parameters in a command document, then pass the command document to the
``run_command()`` method.

The following code shows how you can use the ``run_command()``
method to run the ``hello`` command, which returns information about
the current member's role in the replica set, on a database:

.. code-block:: rust

   let result = my_db.run_command(doc! { "hello": 1 }, None).await?;

To find a link to a full list of database commands and corresponding
parameters, see the :ref:`Additional Information section
<rust-addtl-info-runcommand>`.

.. note:: Read Preference

   The ``run_command()`` method does not obey the read preference you
   might have set on your ``Database`` object elsewhere in your code. By
   default, it uses the ``primary`` read preference.
   
   You can set a read preference for command execution by
   passing an options object. The following code shows how to specify a
   read preference in a ``SelectionCriteria`` instance and pass it as an
   option to the ``run_command()`` method:
   
   .. code-block:: rust

      let command_options: SelectionCriteria = SelectionCriteria::ReadPreference(
          ReadPreference::Primary
      );
      let result = my_db.run_command(command_doc, command_options).await?;
   
   For more information on read preference options, see :manual:`Read
   Preference </core/read-preference/>` in the Server manual.

.. _rust-command-response:

Response
--------

The ``run_command()`` method returns a ``Document`` instance that contains
the response from the database after the command has been executed. Each
database command performs a different function, so the response content
can vary across commands. However, every response contains a document
with the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - <command result>
     - Fields specific to the database command. For example,
       ``count`` returns the ``n`` field and ``explain`` returns the
       ``queryPlanner`` field.

   * - ``ok``
     - Whether the command has succeeded (``1``)
       or failed (``0``).

   * - ``operationTime``
     - The logical time of the operation. MongoDB uses the
       logical time to order operations.
       
       .. seealso::
  
          To learn more about logical time, see our blog post about the
          :website:`Global Logical Clock </blog/post/transactions-background-part-4-the-global-logical-clock>`.

   * - ``$clusterTime``
     - A document that contains the signed cluster time. Cluster time is a
       logical time used for the ordering of operations.

       This document contains the following fields:

       - ``clusterTime``, the timestamp of the highest known cluster time for the member
       - ``signature``, a document that contains the hash of the cluster time and the ID
         of the key used to sign the cluster time

.. _rust-command-example:

Command Example
---------------

The following code shows how you can use the ``run_command()`` method to run
the ``explain`` command for a ``count`` operation on the ``flowers``
collection of the ``plants`` database. The ``explain`` command runs in the
``"queryPlanner"`` verbosity mode:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/run-command.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-runcommand
   :end-before: end-runcommand

Output
~~~~~~

The output includes fields explaining the
execution of the ``count`` operation, such as the winning plan, which is
the plan selected by the query optimizer, and any rejected
plans. The output also contains information about the execution of the
``explain`` command:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 9-13,19-29

   {
       "$clusterTime": {
           "clusterTime": {
               "T": 1673969525,
               "I": 24
           },
           "signature": {...}
       },
       "command": {
           "$db": "plants",
           "count": "flowers"
       },

       "operationTime": {

           "namespace": "plants.flowers",
           "rejectedPlans": [],
           "winningPlan": {
               "stage": "RECORD_STORE_FAST_COUNT"
           }
       },
       "serverInfo": {...},
       "serverParameters": {
           "internalDocumentSourceGroupMaxMemoryBytes": 104857600,
           ...
       }
