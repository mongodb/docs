     {{operation}} can ensure that the data files do not change for
     MongoDB instances using either the MMAPv1 or the WiredTiger storage
     engines, thus providing consistency for the purposes of creating
     backups.

     In previous MongoDB versions, {{operation}} *cannot* guarantee a
     consistent set of files for low-level backups (e.g. via file copy
     ``cp``, ``scp``, ``tar``) for WiredTiger.

   .. note::

      The {{cachesetting}} limits the size of the WiredTiger internal
      cache. The operating system will use the available free memory
      for filesystem cache, which allows the compressed MongoDB data
      files to stay in memory. In addition, the operating system will
      use any free RAM to buffer file system blocks and file system
      cache.

      To accommodate the additional consumers of RAM, you may have to
      decrease WiredTiger internal cache size.

   The default WiredTiger internal cache size value assumes that there is a
   single :program:`mongod` instance per machine. If a single machine
   contains multiple MongoDB instances, then you should decrease the setting to
   accommodate the other :program:`mongod`
   instances.

   If you run :program:`mongod` in a container (e.g. ``lxc``,
   ``cgroups``, Docker, etc.) that does *not* have access to all of the
   RAM available in a system, you must set {{cachesetting}} to a value less
   than the amount of RAM available in the container. The exact amount
   depends on the other processes running in the container.
