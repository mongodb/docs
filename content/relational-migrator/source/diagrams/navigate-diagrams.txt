This page describes how to navigate your project's diagrams and
entities.

After you :ref:`create a project<rm-create-project-live>`, Relational
Migrator creates an initial diagram containing the entities and
relationships in the Relational and MongoDB models.

If you have a large data model, you can create additional diagrams to
separate the model into smaller subsets. When you have multiple diagrams
in your project, {+rel-mig+} lists the diagram names in tabs at
the top of the workspace.

.. note::

   Diagram tabs appear in the order that the diagrams were created. You
   cannot reorder diagram tabs.

Change the Active Diagram
-------------------------

The active diagram is the diagram currently displayed by Relational
Migrator.

To change the active diagram, click the tab for the diagram you want to
view.

Navigate Diagram Entities
-------------------------

Diagrams are made up of entities. An entity is either a Relational or
MongoDB database object.

{+rel-mig+} provides these modes for navigating entities in a
diagram:

- Pan Mode
- Multi-Select Mode

Pan Mode
~~~~~~~~

In Pan Mode, you can click and drag the diagram to navigate to different
areas. When you click a diagram entity, {+rel-mig+} shows
mapping details for that entity in the right pane.

Pan Mode is the default view mode. When you are in Pan Mode, Relational
Migrator highlights the arrow icon at the top of the diagram.

Multi-Select Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Multi-Select Mode, you can select multiple diagram entities by
clicking and dragging the diagram to create a select box. When you
select multiple entities, {+rel-mig+} shows the selected
entities in the right pane. When multiple entities are selected, you
cannot see any mapping details.

To enter Multi-Select Mode, press and hold :guilabel:`Shift`. When you are in
Multi-Select Mode, {+rel-mig+} highlights the box icon at the
top of the diagram. When you release the shift key, {+rel-mig+}s
returns to Pan Mode.
