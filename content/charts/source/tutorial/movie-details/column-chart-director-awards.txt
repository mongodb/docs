Construct the Chart
-------------------

To discover which directors of films represented in this dataset have
won the most awards, use the ``directors`` and ``awards.wins`` database
fields in your chart. The ``genres`` field provides additional
insight into the specific genres of the films for which these directors have won awards.

A :ref:`column chart <column-bar-chart-ref>` makes it easy to
sort and compare fields with numerical values, so it is a good choice
for this use case.
