This page provides answers to some frequently asked questions we have
encountered. If you have additional questions please contact MongoDB
Support.

Can I perform reads or writes to my destination cluster while ``mongosync`` is syncing?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can perform reads during synchronization if ``canCommit`` is ``true``. 
However, the data that you read is 
:term:`eventually consistent <eventual consistency>`, meaning that you might not 
always read the latest writes.

During an ongoing sync, you can write to any non-synced namespaces in the 
destination cluster as long as the source cluster doesn’t include a namespace 
with the same name. If you write to a synced namespace before issuing a 
:ref:`commit <c2c-api-commit>` and while ``canWrite`` is ``false``, the behavior 
is undefined. To avoid this undefined behavior, you can enable 
:ref:`write blocking <c2c-dr-write-blocking>`.

To check the value of ``canCommit`` or ``canWrite``, call the :ref:`progress 
<c2c-api-progress>` API endpoint.

Can ``mongosync`` run on its own hardware? 
------------------------------------------

Yes, ``mongosync`` can run on its own hardware. ``mongosync`` does not
have to run on the servers that host your MongoDB instances. When
``mongosync`` runs on its own hardware, it can use an operating system
(OS) that is different than the OS on the source or destination
clusters.

.. _c2c-faq-increase-oplog:

Should I increase the size of the ``oplog`` in the source cluster?
------------------------------------------------------------------

The :term:`oplog` is a capped collection that keeps a rolling 
record of all operations that modify the data stored in your databases. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-oplog-background

To learn more about how to increase the size of the ``oplog``, see:
:ref:`tutorial-change-oplog-size`. 

Which connection string options does ``mongosync`` allow?
---------------------------------------------------------

``mongosync`` requires :ref:`readConcern: "majority" <read-concern>`
and :ref:`writeConcern: "majority" <write-concern>`. 

If the ``readConcern`` is not ``majority``, ``mongosync`` returns an
error:

.. code-block:: shell

   Invalid URI option, read concern must be majority

If the ``writeConcern`` is not ``majority``, ``mongosync`` returns an
error:

.. code-block:: shell

   Invalid URI option, write concern must be majority

``mongosync`` accepts all other :ref:`connection string options
<mongodb-uri>`.


Which security and authentication options are supported?
--------------------------------------------------------

``mongosync`` uses a standard MongoDB :ref:`connection string
<mongodb-uri>` to connect to the source and destination clusters. 

:ref:`LDAP <security-auth-ldap>` and :ref:`X509
<authentication-mechanism-x509>` are supported. For available
authentication options, see :ref:`authentication`.


Can I configure ``mongosync`` for high availability?
----------------------------------------------------

There is no automatic failover built into ``mongosync``. However you
can write a script or use your operating system's process managers,
``systemd`` for example, to restart the ``mongosync`` process. 

The ``mongosync`` binary is stateless. The metadata for restarting is
stored on the destination cluster.

A ``mongosync`` operation can be resumed if ``mongosync`` becomes
unavailable during synchronization. When ``mongosync`` becomes
available again, restart the ``mongosync`` process with the same
parameters. ``mongosync`` resumes the operation from where it stopped
when ``mongosync`` became unavailable.

Can the source or destination be a replica set with arbiters? 
-------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, the replica set can have arbiters. The source replica set must
have more than 2 non-arbiter nodes and you must sync from a non-arbiter
node. Use the source cluster's connection string to specify a
:ref:`read preference <mongodb-uri>` for a non-arbiter, data-bearing
node. 

What if I see a Slow Operation Warning?
---------------------------------------

Slow operation warnings can occur during the initial sync or the application 
of a change event when there is a slow read operation on the source cluster 
or a slow write operation on the destination cluster.  The warning may
indicate network congestion or resource strain on the source or destination
cluster.

While these warnings do not indicate failures in themselves, slow operations
can cause operation timeout errors in ``mongosync`` and migration failures.

If you see slow operation warnings, check CPU, memory, and network usage on the
source and destination clusters.  If the clusters are underprovisioned for your
needs, consider upgrading the cluster hardware.

Should I stop a migration if the logs contain the word "error" or "failure"?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, logs that contain the word "error" or "failure" show non-fatal
errors and do not signal that you need to stop ``mongosync`` early.
These logs do not indicate that ``mongosync`` is failing or corrupting
data. If a fatal error occurs, ``mongosync`` stops the sync and writes a
fatal log entry.
