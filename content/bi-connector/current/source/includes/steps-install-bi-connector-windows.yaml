  The MongoDB release team digitally signs all software packages to
  certify that a particular MongoDB package is a valid and unaltered
  MongoDB release. Complete the following steps to verify the MongoDB
  binary against its SHA256 key:

  a. Download the ``.sha256`` file for Windows x64 from `BI Connector
     Downloads page <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/bi-connector/releases>`__. 
  #. Compare the signature file to the MongoDB installer hash using the
     following Powershell script:

     .. code-block:: shell
      
        $sigHash = (Get-Content $Env:HomePath\Downloads\mongodb-bi-win32-x86_64-{version}.msi.sha256 | Out-String).SubString(0,64).ToUpper(); `
        $fileHash = (Get-FileHash $Env:HomePath\Downloads\mongodb-bi-win32-x86_64-{version}.msi).Hash.Trim(); `
        echo $sigHash; echo $fileHash; `
        $sigHash -eq $fileHash

     The command outputs three lines:

     - A SHA256 hash that you downloaded directly from MongoDB.
     - A SHA256 hash computed from the MongoDB binary you downloaded from MongoDB.
     - A True or False result depending if the hashes match.

     If the hashes match, the MongoDB binary is verified.

  a. Run the downloaded ``.msi`` file.
  #. Follow the wizard instructions to install the files. The binaries 
     install into a ``bin`` directory inside the installation 
     directory. 
     
     If a prior version exists, you might need to configure your system 
     services to launch the new installation. You can delete the old 
     binaries.
