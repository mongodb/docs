Replica Sets
------------

MMS backups for replica sets uses a lightweight backup agent that runs
within a deployment to copy data to the Backup service. Internally,
MMS Backup operates like a secondary in a replica set.

The agent first performs a process that resembles the
:ref:`initial sync for new replica set members
<replica-set-initial-sync>`. The agent *always* collects :term:`oplog`
entries and, just like :doc:`replication
</core/replication-introduction>`, applies those operations to the
backup snapshots. MMS Backup uses this oplog to build point-in-time
snapshots of the replica set.

If MMS cannot reach the backup agent, MMS automatically sends an
alert. MMS also alerts if the MMS Backup service falls too far behind
the deployment.

See the :mms:`tutorial for enabling backup with MMS
</backup/tutorial/enable-backup-for-replica-set/>` to begin using MMS
Backup.

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each shard in a production sharded cluster is a replica set. MMS
Backup treats each shard like all other replica sets.

To create a backup of a sharded cluster, MMS Backup temporarily
disables all :ref:`balancing operations <sharding-balancing>`
and inserts a synchronization token into the oplog of all shards. MMS
Backup uses these tokens to produce snapshots of the cluster.

MMS Backup produces these cluster wide backups on a regular schedule,
and can restore the sharded cluster to one of these points in time.

See the :mms:`tutorial for enabling backup for sharded clusters with MMS
</backup/tutorial/enable-backup-for-sharded-cluster/>` to begin
backing up a sharded cluster with MMS Backup.

Restoration
~~~~~~~~~~~

MMS Backup provides restorations in the form of MongoDB data
files. MMS can either provide from the remote MMS servers or push a
set of MongoDB data files onto a local directory on a server.

See :mms:`Restore from a Stored Snapshot
</backup/tutorial/restore-from-snapshot/>` and :mms:`Restore a Replica
set from a Point in the Last 24 Hours
</backup/tutorial/restore-from-point-in-time-snapshot/>`.

Use
~~~

MMS simplifies the set up and configuration of a backup
system. The Backup agent has no dependencies and minimal
configuration. However, the Backup agent must be able to contact the
MMS server. See the :mms:`Backup agent installation
</backup/tutorial/install-and-start-backup-agent/>` and :mms:`Backup
agent configuration </backup/tutorial/configure-backup-agent>`
tutorials for a description of this process.

Because MMS tracks oplog entries, MMS Backup can provide restores for
any point in time within the past 24 hours. Regular snapshots for
replica sets and sharded clusters ensure your ability to restore to
specific earlier states as well.
