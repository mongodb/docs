To select the MongoDB version for your cluster, use the
dropdown in the :guilabel:`Additional Settings` section
of the cluster form:

You can upgrade an existing |service| cluster to a newer major
MongoDB version, if available, when you 
:ref:`scale a cluster <scale-cluster-version>`. However, you 
cannot downgrade a cluster's MongoDB version.

.. important::

   If your project contains a :ref:`custom role <mongodb-roles>`
   that uses actions introduced in a specific MongoDB version, you
   cannot create a cluster with a MongoDB version less than that
   version unless you delete the custom role.
