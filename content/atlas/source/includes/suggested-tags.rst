Suggested Tags
--------------

When you create resource tags in the {+atlas-ui+}, 
|service| automatically suggests tag keys and values. We recommend that 
you apply the ``environment`` and ``application`` tag keys to every 
resource. 

The following suggested tag keys appear in the :guilabel:`Key` 
drop-down:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tag Key
     
     - Description
     
   * - ``application``
     
     - Key for the project, service, or application of the resource.

   * - ``environment``

     - Key for the deployment environment of the resource. 

If you select the ``environment`` suggested tag key, the following 
suggested tag values appear in the :guilabel:`Value` drop-down:

- ``development``
- ``production``
- ``staging``
- ``test``

Your recent tags appear under the suggested ones. This list includes 
tags previously used for other resources.
