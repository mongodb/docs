The |pa| monitors queries that MongoDB considers slow and
suggests new indexes to improve query performance. The threshold for
slow queries varies based on the average time of operations on your
cluster to provide recommendations pertinent to your workload.

Recommended indexes are accompanied by sample queries, grouped by
:term:`query shape`, that were run against a collection that would
benefit from the suggested index. The |pa| doesn't negatively affect 
the performance of your |service| {+clusters+}.

You can also monitor collection-level :manual:`query latency </reference/operator/aggregation/collStats/#latencystats-document>` with 
:ref:`Namespace Insights <namespace-insights>` and query performance 
with the :ref:`Query Profiler <query-profiler>`.

.. note::

   If the slow query log contains consecutive :pipeline:`$match` stages 
   in the aggregation pipeline, the two stages can :manual:`coalesce 
   </core/aggregation-pipeline-optimization/#-match----match-coalescence>` 
   into the first :pipeline:`$match` stage and result in a single 
   :pipeline:`$match` stage. As a result, the query shape in the 
   |pa| might differ from the actual query you ran.

Common Reasons for Slow Queries
-------------------------------

If a query is slow, common reasons include:

- The query is unsupported by your current indexes. 
- Some documents in your collection have large array fields that are 
  costly to search and index.
- One query retrieves information from multiple collections with 
  :manual:`$lookup </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup>`.

Required Access
---------------

To view collections with slow queries and see suggested indexes, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Read Only` access or higher to the project. 

To view field values in a sample query in 
the |pa|, you must have :authrole:`Project Observability Viewer`, 
:authrole:`Project Data Access Read Only`,
:authrole:`Project Data Access Read/Write`, or
:authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` access to the project.

To enable or disable the |service|-managed slow operation threshold, 
you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project. Users 
with :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves to the 
project as a ``Project Owner``.

Configure the Slow Query Threshold
----------------------------------

By default, |service| dynamically adjusts your slow query threshold
based on the execution time of operations across your cluster. However, 
you can opt out of this feature and instead use a fixed slow query
threshold of 100 milliseconds. You can disable the |service|-managed
slow operation threshold with the {+atlas-cli+}, 
{+atlas-admin-api+}, or {+atlas-ui+}.

.. note::

   |service| {+clusters+} with Atlas Search enabled don't support
   the |service|-managed slow query operation threshold.

For ``M0``, ``M2``, ``M5`` clusters and {+Serverless-instances+}, 
|service| disables the |service|-managed slow query operation threshold by default and you can't enable it.

Disable the |service|-Managed Slow Operation Threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   By default, |service| dynamically adjusts your slow query threshold
   based on the execution time of operations across your cluster. If 
   you disable the |service|-managed slow query threshold, it no longer 
   dynamically adjusts. MongoDB defaults the fixed slow query threshold 
   to 100 milliseconds. We don't recommend that you set the fixed slow 
   query threshold lower than 100 milliseconds.

To disable the |service|-managed slow operation threshold and use a
fixed threshold of 100 milliseconds:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-performanceAdvisor-slowOperationThreshold-disable.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      See :oas-atlas-op:`Disable Managed Slow Operation Threshold 
      </disableManagedSlowOperationThreshold>`.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: atlasui

      In the :ref:`Project Settings <project-settings>` for
      the current project, toggle :guilabel:`Managed Slow Operations` to 
      :guilabel:`Off`.

Enable the |service|-Managed Slow Operation Threshold
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| enables the |service|-managed slow operation threshold by default. To re-enable the |service|-managed slow operation threshold
that you previously disabled:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-performanceAdvisor-slowOperationThreshold-enable.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      See :oas-atlas-op:`Enable Managed Slow Operation Threshold 
      </enableManagedSlowOperationThreshold>`. 

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: atlasui

      In the :ref:`Project Settings <project-settings>` for
      the current project, toggle :guilabel:`Managed Slow Operations` to 
      :guilabel:`On`.

Index Considerations
--------------------

Indexes improve read performance, but a large number of indexes can
negatively impact write performance since indexes must be updated during
writes. If your collection already has several indexes, consider this 
tradeoff of read and write performance when deciding whether to create 
new indexes. Examine whether a query for such a collection can be 
modified to take advantage of existing indexes, as well as whether a 
query occurs often enough to justify the cost of a new index.

.. _query-inefficiency-score:

Index Suggestions
-----------------

The :guilabel:`Performance Advisor` ranks the indexes according to 
their :guilabel:`Impact`, which is based on the total wasted bytes read 
by the associated operations. To learn more about how the |pa| ranks 
indexes, see :ref:`pa-index-ranking`.

To learn how to create indexes that the |pa| suggests, see 
:ref:`pa-create-suggested-indexes`.

Index Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each index that the |pa| suggests contains the following
metrics. These metrics apply specifically to queries which would be
improved by the index:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Execution Count`
     - Number of queries executed per hour which would be
       improved.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Execution Time`
     - Current average execution time in milliseconds for affected
       queries.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Query Targeting`
     - Average number of documents read per document returned by
       affected queries. A higher query
       targeting score indicates a greater degree of inefficiency. For
       more information on query targeting, see :ref:`query-targeting`.

   * - :guilabel:`In Memory Sort`
     - Current number of affected queries per hour that needed to be
       sorted in memory.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Docs Scanned`
     - Average number of documents scanned.
   
   * - :guilabel:`Average Docs Returned`
     - Average number of documents returned.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Object Size`
     - Average object size.

Sample Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each suggested index, the |pa| shows the most commonly executed 
query shapes that the index would improve. For each query shape, the 
|pa| displays the following metrics:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Execution Count`
     - Number of queries executed per hour which match the query
       shape.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Execution Time`
     - Average execution time in milliseconds for queries
       which match the query shape.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Query Targeting`
     - Average number of documents read for
       every document returned by matching queries. A higher query
       targeting score indicates a greater degree of inefficiency. For
       more information on query targeting, see :ref:`query-targeting`.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Docs Scanned`
     - Average number of documents scanned.

   * - :guilabel:`Average Docs Returned`
     - Average number of documents returned. 

The |pa| also shows each executed sample query that matches the 
query shape, with specific metrics for that query.

.. _query-targeting:

Query Targeting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each index suggestion includes an :guilabel:`Average Query Targeting`
score indicating how many documents were read for every document
returned for the index's corresponding query shapes. A score of 1
represents very efficient query shapes because every document read
matched the query and was returned with the query results. All suggested
indexes represent an opportunity to improve query performance.

Filter Index Suggestions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the |pa| suggests indexes for all clusters
in the deployment. To only show suggested indexes from a specific
collection, use the :guilabel:`Collection` dropdown at the top of
the |pa|.

You can also adjust the time range the |pa| takes into
account when suggesting indexes by using the :guilabel:`Time Range`
dropdown at the top of the |pa|.

Limitations of Index Suggestions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Timestamp Format
````````````````

The |pa| can't suggest indexes for MongoDB databases
configured to use the ``ctime`` timestamp format. As a workaround, set
the timestamp format for such databases to either ``iso8601-utc`` or
``iso8601-local``. To learn more about timestamp formats, see
:manual:`mongod --timeStampFormat </reference/program/mongod/#std-option-mongod.--timeStampFormat>`.

Log Quantity
````````````

.. include:: /includes/log-rate-limiting.rst

Time-Series Collections
```````````````````````

The |pa| doesn't provide performance suggestions for
time-series collections.

User Feedback
`````````````

The |pa| includes a user feedback button for Index 
Suggestions. |service| hides this button for {+Serverless-instances+}.

.. _pa-create-suggested-indexes:

Create Suggested Indexes
------------------------

You can create :manual:`indexes </core/indexes>` suggested by the
|pa| directly within the |pa| itself.
When you create indexes, keep the ratio of reads to writes on the
target collection in mind. Indexes come with a performance cost, but
are more than worth the cost for frequent queries on large data sets.
To learn more about indexing strategies, see
:manual:`Indexing Strategies </applications/indexes/>`.

Behavior and Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can't create indexes through the |pa| if :ref:`Data Explorer 
  <atlas-ui>` is disabled for your project. You can still view 
  the |pa| recommendations, but you must create those indexes from 
  {+mongosh+}.

- You can only create one index at a time through the Performance
  Advisor. If you want to create more simultaneously, you can do so
  using the :ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui-indexes>`, a
  :doc:`driver </driver-connection>`, or the
  :ref:`shell <connect-mongo-shell>`

- |service| always creates indexes for entire {+database-deployments+}.
  If you create an index while viewing the |pa| for a single shard in a 
  sharded {+cluster+}, |service| creates that index for the entire 
  sharded {+cluster+}.
