Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use **aggregation operations** in the
{+driver-long+}.

Aggregation operations process data in your MongoDB collections based on
your specifications in the **aggregation pipeline**. An aggregation
pipeline consists of one or more **stages**. Each stage performs an
operation based on its expression operators. After the driver executes
the aggregation pipeline, it returns an aggregated result.

Analogy
~~~~~~~

Aggregation operations operate similarly to a car factory. Car factories
have an assembly line. The assembly lines have assembly stations with
specialized tools to perform a specific task. To build a car, you send
raw parts to the factory. Then, the assembly line transforms and
assembles the parts into a car.

The assembly line resembles the **aggregation pipeline**, the assembly
stations in the assembly line resemble the **aggregation stages**, the
specialized tools represent the **expression operators**, and the
finished product resembles the **aggregated result**. 

Compare Operations
------------------

The following table lists the tasks you can perform by using find and aggregation operations.

.. list-table::

   * - Find Operations
     - Aggregation Operations

   * - | Select *what* documents to return
       | Select *which* fields to return
       | Sort the results
       | Limit the results
       | Count the results
     - | Select *what* documents to return
       | Select *which* fields to return
       | Sort the results
       | Limit the results
       | Count the results
       | Rename fields
       | Calculate fields
       | Summarize data
       | Group values

Limitations
-----------

Aggregation operations have limitations. When performing aggregation
operations, keep the following in mind:

- Returned documents must not violate the :manual:`BSON document size
  limit </reference/limits/#BSON-Document-Size>` of 16 megabytes.
- Pipeline stages have a memory limit of 100 megabytes by default. If
  required, you may exceed this limit by using the `allowDiskUse()
  <{+api+}/mongo/options#AggregateOptionsBuilder.SetAllowDiskUse>`__
  method.
- The :manual:`$graphLookup
  </reference/operator/aggregation/graphLookup/>` stage
  has a strict memory limit of 100 megabytes and ignores the
  ``allowDiskUse`` setting.

Examples
--------

The examples in this section use the following ``Tea`` struct as a model for documents
in the ``tea`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/aggregation.go
   :start-after: start-tea-struct
   :end-before: end-tea-struct
   :language: go
   :dedent:

To run the examples in this section, load the sample data into the
``tea`` collection in the ``db`` database by using the following snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/aggregation.go
   :start-after: begin insert docs
   :end-before: end insert docs
   :language: go
   :dedent:

Each document contains information about the tea type, the available toppings, and
the price.

Average Rating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example calculates and displays the average rating and
number of ratings for each tea category.

The aggregation pipeline uses the ``$group`` stage to group the
documents by the ``category`` field, calculates the average using the
``$avg`` expression operator, and counts the number of documents using
the ``$sum`` expression operator.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/aggregation.go
      :start-after: begin average
      :end-before: end average
      :language: go
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Average price of black tea options: $6.075
      Number of black tea options: 4 

      Average price of green tea options: $5.70
      Number of green tea options: 4  

Omit Fields in Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example matches documents where you can get milk foam as a
topping and lists the two cheapest options.

The aggregation pipeline contains the following stages:

- ``$match`` stage to match documents where the ``toppings`` field contains "milk foam"
- ``$unset`` stage to omit the ``_id`` and ``category`` fields
- ``$sort`` stage to sort the ``price`` and ``toppings`` in ascending order
- ``$limit`` stage to show the first two documents

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/aggregation.go
      :start-after: begin unset
      :end-before: end unset
      :language: go
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Tea: Hojicha 
      Toppings: lemon, ginger, milk foam 
      Price: $5.55 
      
      Tea: Gyokuro 
      Toppings: berries, milk foam 
      Price: $5.65
