==================
Use MMS Public API
==================

Overview
--------

The MMS Public API follows the principles of the REST architectural style to
expose a number of internal resources which enable programmatic access to MMS's
features. This document describes the procedure for getting started
with the MMS Public API.

Procedure
---------

Before using the API, you must:

1. *Generate an API Key* - Go to the **Settings** page in the MMS UI and click
   on the **Public API Settings** tab. Here, you can manage the API Keys
   associated to your MMS user account. Note the following:

   a. You can have up to ten keys associated to your account. Each key can be
      either enabled or disabled, but be aware that they both count towards the
      ten key limit.

   b. When a new key is generated, it will be shown to you *one time only.* An
      API Key is like a password, so keep it secret. For that reason, we will
      not show the entire key in the MMS UI after it is initially created.

   c. API Keys are associated to a user and therefore have the same level of
      access as that user.

2. *Define your whitelist* - Certain API operations require a higher level of
   security and are protected by a whitelist. Only client requests that
   originate from a whitelisted IP address will be permitted to invoke such
   operations. To define your whitelist, go to the **Settings** page in the MMS
   UI and click on the **Public API Settings** tab. Here, you can manage the IP
   addresses in your whitelist. Currently, you must enter each permitted IP
   address individually; CIDR notation is not supported.

3. *Enable the Public API for each Group* - The Public API is enabled on a
   per-group basis, so make sure to enable it for all the Groups that need to
   use it. To enable it, go to the **Settings** page in the MMS UI and click on
   the **API Settings** tab. You will see an ON/OFF switch for turning the API
   on or off. Note that this setting is only visible to users with the
   ``Group Owner`` role.
