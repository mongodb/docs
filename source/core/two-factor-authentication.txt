Two-factor authentication provides a second layer of security for your
|mms| account.

.. important::

   Legacy |2fa| is deprecated. If you currently have legacy |2fa|
   enabled you can continue to use it, but it is recommended that you
   switch  to :ref:`multi-factor authentication <mms-enable-mfa>`. To use
   |mfa|, :ref:`disable legacy two-factor authentication <mms-disable-legacy-2fa>`
   and :ref:`enable multi-factor authentication <mms-enable-mfa>` instead.

.. note:: Google Authentication Uses Google 2-Step Verification

   .. include:: /includes/facts/google-auth/2fa.rst

|mms| requires |2fa| to help users control access to their |mms|
accounts.

To log into |mms|, a user must provide their password ("something
you know"), as well as a second time-sensitive verification code,
delivered during authentication ("something you have"). By requiring
both factors, |mms| can grant authentication requests with a higher
degree of confidence.

.. note::

   If an :authrole:`Organization Owner` enables |mfa| for an
   :doc:`organization </tutorial/manage-organizations/>`, all
   organization members must enable |mfa| individually to access the
   organization. Organization members who have not enabled |mfa-short| are
   able to access |mms|, but not the organization for which |mfa-short| is
   required.

After you enter your username and password, you are prompted for a
six-digit time-sensitive verification code. This code is sent to a
separate device, such as a mobile phone or security token, that you
can read and enter into |mms| and complete your login.

|mms| provides the following sources for |2fa| verification codes:

.. tabs::

   tabs:

     - id: phone
       name: Text/Voice
       content: |

         Text Messages (|sms|)
           When |mms| prompts you for a verification code,
           |mms| sends the 6-digit verification code using text
           (|sms|) to the provided phone number.

           The cellular carrier's |sms| rates apply.

         Automated Voice Calls (US / Canada only)
           When |mms| prompts you for a verification code,
           |mms| calls the provided phone number. An automated
           system repeats the 6-digit verification code a total of
           three times before hanging up.

           The cellular carrier's Voice Call rates apply.

           .. note::

             |mms| users who operate within a geographic region
             with limited cellular service coverage or reliability may
             encounter delays in receiving the |2fa| code via |sms| or
             Voice. Consider using a |2fa| app or device instead.

     - id: app
       name: 2FA App
       content: |

         When |mms| prompts you for a verification code, you can
         provide one that is generated in a |2fa| app. You must pair
         the |2fa| app with |mms| first.

         This tutorial uses the `Google Authenticator`_ mobile app.

         There are other mobile device apps and web browser plug-ins
         that provide |2fa| capabilities. You can use any that support
         the |totp|.

         You can pair only one app with |mms| at any one time.

     - id: token
       name: 2FA device
       content: |

         When |mms| prompts you for a verification code, you can
         provide one that is generated in a |2fa| |piv| device. You
         must pair the |piv| device app with |mms| first using an
         |2fa| app. These devices must support |totp|.

         This procedure uses a YubiKey security key, specifically
         those that work with
         `Authenticator Codes <https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006419-using-your-yubikey-with-authenticator-codes>`__.
         Other |2fa| |piv| hardware devices that use |totp| should
         work in a similar fashion.

         .. note:: Informational Reference only

            MongoDB does not endorse the aforementioned service, and
            its reference is intended only as informational. Defer to
            your organization's procedures in selecting the
            appropriate vendor or service for supporting |2fa| via
            smart card or similar device.

Two-Factor Authentication on a Shared Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A global team that shares the same |mms| account can use Google
Authenticator and use the same seed code for all team members. To
generate a common seed code that all team members can use, select the
:guilabel:`Can't scan the barcode?` link when
:ref:`Configuring Two-Factor Authentication with Google Authenticator <two-factor-google-authenticator>`.

Generate New Recovery Codes
---------------------------

As a backup, you can generate recovery codes to use in place of a sent
code when you do not have access to a phone, |2fa| app or |2fa| device. Each recovery code is single-use, and you
should save these codes in a secure place. When you generate new
recovery codes, you invalidate previously generated ones.

.. include:: /includes/steps/two-factor-generate-recovery-codes.rst

.. _two-factor-reset:
 
Reset Legacy Two Factor Authentication
--------------------------------------

If you have legacy |2fa| enabled and you lose access to your |2fa| device,
you can reset |2fa| for your account. 

Because legacy |2fa| is deprecated, you cannot re-establish it after you
reset it. Instead, you can :ref:`enable multi-factor authentication
<mms-enable-mfa>`.

.. important::

   The following procedure resets legacy |2fa| for your |mms| account.
   To edit |mfa| settings, see :ref:`multi-factor authentication
   <mms-enable-mfa-procedure>`.

#. Log in to |mms| with your username and password.

#. When the |2fa| prompt displays:

   a. Click the :guilabel:`Reset your two-factor authentication` link.

   b. Click :guilabel:`Cloud Manager user? Click here` at the
      bottom of the :guilabel:`Reset Two Factor Authentication`
      modal.

#. Type your |mms| username.

#. Click :guilabel:`Reset Two Factor Authentication`.

   |mms| emails a link to the e-mail account associated with the |mms|
   username.

#. Check your email.

#. Click the link that |mms| sent to start the |2fa| reset procedure.

#. Follow the directions on the |2fa| reset page. After completing the
   reset procedure, |mms| allows you to log in to the |mms| account
   without requiring a |2fa| code.
