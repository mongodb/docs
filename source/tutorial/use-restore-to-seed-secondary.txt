Overview
--------

When a new secondary member is added to a replica set, MongoDB will
synchronize data to that new secondary as it would with any member of
the replica set. This can be very resource or time intensive if the
database is large.

As an alternative to the regular synchronization, the new secondary
member can first be "seeded" with data from an existing backup. This
limits performance impact to the new secondary and allows the active
MongoDB process to continue storing and retrieving data.

Prerequisites
-------------

To seed a secondary from a backup restore file, you must have:

- A backup restore file.

- The :file:`seedSecondary.sh` and :file:`seedSecondary.bat` scripts
  included in the backup restore file.

When you run the :file:`seedSecondary.sh` script on a Unix-based system or
:file:`seedSecondary.bat` script on a Windows-based system as part of this
tutorial, you must provide the replica set's oplog size in gigabytes.

   See **Check the Size of the Oplog** on 
   :manual:`Troubleshoot Replica Sets </tutorial/troubleshoot-replica-sets>` 
   if you do not have the size.

Considerations
--------------

If the format of your backup differs from the format you want for your
restored database, such as when you want to restore a backup of a
deployment that uses the MMAPv1 storage engine to a deployment that
uses the WiredTiger storage engine, then use ``mongodump`` to create
the backup and ``mongorestore`` to restore the data to the new database.

.. important::
   The ``seedSecondary`` script is omitted from the restore files if
   you have:

   - Blacklisted databases or collections or 
   - The legacy sync cluster connection configuration servers for a
     sharded cluster

     Deployments using replica set configuration servers are unaffected.
  
   If you were to have received the script as part of the restore
   files, then tried to apply it, the secondary would become
   inconsistent with the other members.
     
.. seealso:: :manual:`Upgrade Config Servers to Replica Set </tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set/>`.

Seeding a new secondary from a backup restore requires an oplog window
on the current primary that spans back to the snapshot's timestamp.
