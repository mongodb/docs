   :description: Set up AWS private endpoints for Online Archives using Atlas UI or API, requiring Project Owner access and AWS account permissions.

MongoDB supports |aws| and |azure| private endpoints for {+Online-Archive+}\s. 
You can set up the private endpoints from the {+atlas-ui+} 
and {+atlas-admin-api+}.

.. note:: 

   You can set up private endpoints for a dedicated cluster. To learn 
   more, see :ref:`private-endpoint`.

Required Access 
---------------

To set up a private endpoint for an {+Online-Archive+}, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Owner` access or higher to the project.

Prerequisites 
-------------

The procedure differs depending on whether you use |aws| or |azure| for your cloud provider.
Select the appropriate tab:

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: AWS
      :tabid: aws

      1. Have an |aws| user account with an |iam| user policy that grants 
         permissions to create, modify, describe, and delete endpoints. For 
         more information on controlling the use of interface endpoints, see 
         the :aws:`AWS Documentation 
         </vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html>`.

      #. :aws:`Install the AWS CLI 
         </cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html>`.

      #. If you have not already done so, create your |vpc| and EC2 instances 
         in |aws|. See the :aws:`AWS documentation </index.html>` for 
         guidance.

   .. tab:: Azure
      :tabid: azure

      1. Have an |azure| user account with 
         permissions to create resources like virtual networks and private endpoints.
         To learn more about the permissions required, see 
         the `Azure Documentation 
         <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/rbac-permissions>`__.

      #. `Install the Azure CLI <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli>`__.

      .. important:: 

         With |azure|, you can create *up to three private endpoints per project* 
         for an {+Online-Archive+} due to an |azure|-imposed limit. This is why |service| 
         prevents you from deleting an |service| project before first deleting its 
         private endpoints. To request more than three private endpoints for a project, 
         contact :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>`.

.. note:: 

   You can't use your |service| cluster :ref:`private endpoint ID
   <private-endpoint>` for an {+Online-Archive+}. The {+Online-Archive+}
   endpoint ID must be different from your |service| cluster endpoint
   ID, if you have one.

Set Up Private Endpoint Through {+atlas-ui+} 
--------------------------------------------------

You can create a new private endpoint or add an existing private 
endpoint for an {+Online-Archive+} through your {+atlas-ui+}. To set up the private endpoint:

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: AWS
      :tabid: aws


      .. tabs:: 

         .. tab:: Create New Endpoint 
            :tabid: create-new 

            .. include:: /includes/steps-oa-create-new-privatelink.rst

         .. tab:: Add Existing Endpoint 
            :tabid: add-existing

            .. include:: /includes/steps-oa-add-existing-privatelink.rst

   .. tab:: Azure
      :tabid: azure

      .. tabs:: 

         .. tab:: Create New Endpoint 
            :tabid: create-new 

            .. include:: /includes/steps-adf-create-privatelink-azure.rst      

         .. tab:: Add Existing Endpoint 
            :tabid: add-existing

            .. include:: /includes/steps-oa-add-existing-privatelink-azure.rst

Set Up Private Endpoint Through the API 
---------------------------------------

To configure a private endpoint for an online archive from the API, 
send a ``POST`` request with the private endpoint ID to the 
:oas-bump-atlas-op:`privateNetworkSettings 
<creategroupdatafederationprivateendpoint>` endpoint. 

- If the endpoint ID already exists and there is no change to 
  the comment associated with the endpoint, |service| makes no change 
  to the endpoint ID list.
- If the endpoint ID already exists and there is a change to the 
  associated comment, |service| updates the ``comment`` value only in 
  the endpoint ID list.
- If the endpoint ID doesn't exist, |service| appends the new endpoint 
  to the list of endpoints in the endpoint ID list.

To learn more about the syntax and options, see :oas-bump-atlas-op:`API 
<creategroupdatafederationprivateendpoint>`.
