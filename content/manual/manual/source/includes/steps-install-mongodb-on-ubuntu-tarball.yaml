title: Extract the files from the downloaded archive.
stepnum: 2

pre: |

   Using an archive manager program or the ``tar`` command, extract the
   files.

   For example, to extract from the terminal shell, you can use the
   following ``tar`` command:

   .. tip::

      If you downloaded a different MongoDB {+version+} point release,
      be sure to modify the command to reflect the correct ``.tgz``
      file name.

   .. code-block:: bash

      tar -zxvf mongodb-linux-*-{+release+}.tgz

title: Optional. Ensure the binaries are in a directory listed in your ``PATH`` environment variable.

   The MongoDB binaries are in the ``<mongodb-install-directory>/bin/``
   directory.

   To avoid having to specify the path to the MongoDB binaries, you can
   create symbolic links to the binaries from a directory listed in
   your ``PATH`` variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin``. Update
   ``/path/to/the/mongodb-directory/`` with your installation
   directory as appropriate.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo ln -s  /path/to/the/mongodb-directory/bin/* /usr/local/bin/

   Alternatively, you can copy these binaries into a directory listed
   in your ``PATH`` variable such as ``/usr/local/bin``.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo cp <mongodb-install-directory>/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
