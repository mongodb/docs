1.13.2 Changelog
----------------

*Released May 27, 2025*

Data Integrity Issues Update: 

Investigation and resolution of data integrity issues affecting certain CDC 
and snapshot migration configurations is ongoing as a high-priority project. 
Continuous mode migrations (CDC) remains disabled in this release for
projects that contain embedded documents and arrays. Snapshot migrations and 
'one-to-one' CDC migrations that contain no embeddings are still enabled. 

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed an issue where snapshot migrations containing circular references 
  (where the set of tables cannot be ordered such that each parent is fully 
  migrated before any embedded documents or arrays) may result in one or more 
  embeddings being omitted. 
- Migration job warnings no longer count towards the error limit for that job.

1.13.1 Changelog
----------------

*Released April 29, 2025*

Data Integrity Advisory:

.. warning::

   This release includes two critical fixes for data integrity issues affecting 
   previous versions of Relational Migrator. The Relational Migrator team has 
   also identified further data integrity issues that affect certain Snapshot 
   and Continuous Migration configurations. These issues are scheduled to be 
   addressed in an upcoming release. This 1.13.1 release temporarily disables 
   Continuous Migrations (CDC mode) for projects which include any embedded 
   document or array mappings. If Relational Migrator indicates that you may
   be affected when running a new CDC job after upgrading, MongoDB recommends
   holding off on performing Continuous Migration jobs in production or
   manually verifying your migrated data for potential data loss until further 
   updates are available.

Critical Bug Fixes:

- Fixed an issue where Snapshot Migrations could fail to populate deeply nested 
  Embedded Arrays if the mappings are structured such that an Embedded Document 
  mapping is between two Embedded Array mappings in the mapping hierarchy.
- Fixed an issue with Continuous Migrations where relational tables with no 
  primary key could cause duplicate entries in embedded arrays when the row 
  is updated.
 

Improvements:

- Improved performance for snapshot migrations containing embedded arrays.
- Faster initial database loads when connecting to large databases containing 
  many tables.
- Enhanced migration and verification errors with more details and debugging 
  information. 
- Improved error and warning reporting for pre-migration and post-migration 
  tasks.
- Imported and new projects now use a consistent naming scheme to generate 
  their project ID.
- Added support for Oracle JDBC Driver version 23.
 

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed an issue with idempotent-mode snapshot migrations where subsequent runs 
  of the migration could cause duplicate entries in embedded arrays. This occurs 
  with nested mappings where the embedded array contains additional embedded 
  documents or arrays.
- Fixed an issue where fields containing dot characters in their name cause 
  errors during snapshot and continuous migrations.
- Fixed issues where editing an embedded mapping field to add the prefix ``_id`` 
  results in the unexpected UI behaviour.
- Updated generated prerequisite configuration and permissions SQL script for 
  Oracle to include AWS RDS instructions.

1.13.0 Changelog
----------------

*Released March 24, 2025*

New features:

- :ref:`Pre-Migration Analysis <rm-app-analysis>` is now in Public Preview. 
  This feature allows you to identify migration issues before starting and get
  actionable recommendations for a smooth migration. Pre Migration Analysis
  supports the following databases:
  
  - Oracle
  - SQL Server
  - PostgreSQL
  - MySQL

Bug fixes:

- Fixed an issue where job API calls would hang when table filters returned an
  empty result.
- Fixed an issue that prevented users from saving calculated key fields for 
  projects that use the single-inherited or wrapped key handling options.
- Fixed an issue with embedded array mappings and excluded fields, where blank 
  source data could trigger an 'unset' error rather than being processed silently.


1.12.0 Changelog
----------------

*Released February 3, 2025*

New features:

- Added support for four source databases, using JDBC connectivity to
  enable snapshot-based data migration and database object conversion from:

  - YugabyteDB
  - CockroachDB
  - SAP Sybase IQ (SAP IQ)
  - SAP SQL Anywhere
  
  .. note:: 
    JDBC connection support for these databases is currently in Public Preview.

    a custom JDBC connector.

- Added support for X.509 certificate authentication for client authentication on
  MongoDB target databases.
- Added information for MongoDB Atlas users attempting large data migrations to
  lower-tier MongoDB Atlas clusters which may result in extended migration time. For 
  large jobs where migration performance is a consideration, users may be able 
  to reduce total migration time by up to 54% by upgrading to a faster Atlas tier. 
- Added optional news section to inform users of new migrator tool capabilities,
  important upgrades and security announcements. This online-only feature can be
  disabled in user properties.
- Improved error reporting when skipping import of unsupported binary data types 
  in Microsoft SQL Server (FILESTREAM type) and Oracle (LONG, LONG RAW and BFILE types).
- Increased the maximum file size of supported DDL schemas file from 4MB to 20MB.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed an issue where Postgres created a duplicate replication slot in certain 
  scenarios. 



1.11.0 Changelog
----------------

  convert large numbers of SQL queries, views, and stored procedures. 
  See :ref:`rm-bulk-conversion`.
- Snapshot jobs now create top-level documents using a non-idempotent 
  bulk insert method. This improves performance.
- Added explicit control over idempotent behavior through the 
  ``migrator.engine.transform.idempotency: true`` setting in the 
  ``user.properties`` file.
- Internal indexes used for migration are automatically deleted
  after job completion. This improves performance.
- Updated SQL Server JDBC driver to the latest version.

  were not routed through the system proxy.
- Fixed an issue where individual rows exceeding the 16MB document 
  limit caused the job to stop immediately, instead of continuing 
  up to the error threshold. 
- Fixed an issue where data verification was unable to detect some 
  issues caused by precision differences between source and target 
  data types.
- Fixed an issue where each query could be imported twice.
- Fixed an issue where converted queries sometimes used incorrect 
  paths for embedded mappings.
