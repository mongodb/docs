You can configure |service| to send alerts from your project to
your |pagerduty| dashboard. With PagerDuty integration, you can:

- Record incidents and notify on-call responders based on |service| 
  alerts.

- Automatically resolve incidents in PagerDuty when an |service| alert 
  is closed with bidirectional synchronization.

How it Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a PagerDuty integration, you can send |service| cluster event data 
to PagerDuty when |service| alerts that you specify are triggered. 
PagerDuty can create a new incident for the corresponding 
service, filter additional alerts from the same source into that 
incident, and alert on-call PagerDuty users.

Once the |service| alert has been resolved, PagerDuty resolves the 
incident.

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create, update, or remove a PagerDuty integration, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project. Users with 
:authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves to the project 
as a ``Project Owner``.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To integrate |service| with PagerDuty, you must have a PagerDuty 
account.

If you do not have an existing PagerDuty account, you can sign up at
`<https://www.pagerduty.com/sign-up/>`__.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-integrations-create-PAGER_DUTY.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      To integrate with PagerDuty using the {+atlas-ui+}, navigate to
      the PagerDuty integration card:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-configure-pagerduty-integration.rst

      You can configure an |service| integration with |pagerduty| in two ways:

      - By signing into PagerDuty from the |service| 
        :guilabel:`Project Integrations` page, or

      - By providing a valid :guilabel:`Integration Key`.

      Sign into PagerDuty
      ```````````````````
      .. include:: /includes/steps/configure-pagerduty-integration-sign-in.rst

      Provide an :guilabel:`Integration Key`
      ``````````````````````````````````````
      .. include:: /includes/steps/configure-pagerduty-integration-key.rst

      .. important::

         If the :guilabel:`Integration Key` that you specify is invalid,
         the PagerDuty Events API doesn't fail and the :guilabel:`Test
         Integration` button might falsely indicate a successful
         integration. To confirm that your integration is successful, 
         |service| sends an initial alert. Check your PagerDuty
         dashboard for an initial incident created by that |service|
         alert. 

Remove a PagerDuty Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-integrations-delete.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      To remove the PagerDuty integration from your |service| project using the {+atlas-ui+}, click :guilabel:`Remove` on the PagerDuty
      card in your |service| project's :guilabel:`Project Integrations`.
