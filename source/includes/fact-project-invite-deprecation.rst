   .. important:: Project Invitation Deprecation

      The |cloud| release on September 13, 2023 deprecates project 
      invitations. When you invite an organization member to projects 
      within the organization, the user is automatically granted access 
      to those projects and doesn't receive any invitations. When you 
      invite a user to projects in an organization that the user 
      doesn't belong to, the user receives a single invitation to the 
      organization, which includes access to all of the projects that 
      you grant them access to. Invitations expire after 30 days.
