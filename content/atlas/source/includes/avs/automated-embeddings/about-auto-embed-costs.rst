Embedding model pricing is usage-based, with charges billed to the
account linked to the |api| key used for access. Pricing is based on the
number of tokens in your text field and queries.

.. note:: 

   In the context of embedding models and LLMs, tokens are the
   fundamental units of text, such as words, subwords, or characters,
   that the model processes to create embeddings or generate text.
   Tokens are how you are billed for usage of embedding models and LLMs.

If you use the |api| key that you created using your |service| account,
you can monitor |api| key usage from the {+atlas-ui+}. To learn more, see
:ref:`Billing <voyage-billing>`.

If you generated the |api| key directly from |voyage|, see 
:voyage-docs:`Pricing </pricing>` to learn more about the charge for 
requests to the embedding service endpoint.
