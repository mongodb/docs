MongoDB Playgrounds are JavaScript environments where you can prototype
queries, aggregations, and MongoDB commands with helpful syntax
highlighting.

MongoDB Playgrounds provide intelligent autocomplete for:

- The Mongo Shell |api|,
- MongoDB operators,
- Database, collection, and field names.

You can save playgrounds in your workspace and use them to
document how your application interacts with MongoDB.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/note-playgrounds.rst

Prerequisite
------------

To run a playground, you must connect to a MongoDB deployment using
|vsce|. To learn how to connect to a deployment, see
:ref:`vsce-connect`.

Open a Playground
-----------------

To open a playground and begin interacting with your data:

.. include:: /includes/steps/open-new-playground.rst

Your playground runs against the deployment specified in your
:ref:`active connection <vsce-connect>`.

Run a Playground
----------------

To run a playground, click the :guilabel:`Play Button` in VS Code's
top navigation bar.

Run Selected Lines of a Playground
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you select a section of your playground, you may optionally run only
the selected portion. Your selection can consist of a single line or multiple lines.

|vsce| shows the :guilabel:`Run Selected Lines from Playground` button
immediately below your selected section. Click this button to test and
troubleshoot specific lines or sections of your playground.
