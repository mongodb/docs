   :values: reference

The MCP Server has various options that you can set to connect to a
MongoDB cluster and control MCP Server operations. You can set the
options in a JSON configuration file, through a command line, or using
operating system environment variables.

Options List
------------

Use the following configuration options to configure the MCP Server.

.. important::

   If you're a MongoDB Enterprise or MongoDB Atlas user and 
   you require a specific authentication mechanism, 
   see the :ref:`mcp-server-security` section to learn about the
   configuration options for your authentication method.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 10 10 40

   * - CLI Option Name
     - OS Environment Variable Name
     - Type
     - Default
     - Description

   * - ``allowRequestOverrides``
     - ``MDB_MCP_ALLOW_REQUEST_OVERRIDES``
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Flag that indicates if users can override MCP Server configurations
       per-request with request headers and query parameters. For the specific
       override behavior of each configuration option, see the
       :ref:`Override Behavior Table <mcp-config-override-behavior-table>` below.

   * - ``apiClientId``
     - ``MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_ID``
     - string
     - Not set
     - Atlas API client ID for authentication.

   * - ``apiClientSecret``
     - ``MDB_MCP_API_CLIENT_SECRET``
     - string
     - Not set
     - Atlas API client secret for authentication.

   * - ``config``
     - ``MDB_MCP_CONFIG``
     - string
     - Not set
     - Full path to the JSON configuration file. Using the 
       ``MDB_MCP_CONFIG`` environment variable is recommended over using the
       ``--config`` command line option.

   * - ``connectionString``
     - ``MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING``
     - string
     - Not set
     - Connection string for a direct database connection.

       Sets the connection string at runtime to allow the client to
       directly connect to a cluster.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-mcp-connection-string-flag-deprecated.rst

       .. note::

          Typically, avoid providing the connection string at runtime
          because you expose the connection credentials to the large
          language model.

       The connection string is used if the client has never connected
       before, or the client switches the connection to a new cluster if
       the client was previously connected.

       After the client calls the connect or switch connection tool, the
       client reuses the same connection for subsequent operations.
       Therefore, you only need to call the connect or switch connection
       tool once or if you need to switch to a different connection.

   * - ``dryRun``
     - ``MDB_MCP_DRY_RUN``
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - .. include:: /includes/dry-run-option.rst

       To enable the dry-run option, set ``--dryRun`` in the
       configuration file or command line, or set the
       ``MDB_MCP_DRY_RUN`` operating system environment variable to
       ``true``.

       For more information, see
       :ref:`mcp-server-configuration-dry-run-mode`.

   * - ``loggers``
     - ``MDB_MCP_LOGGERS``
     - string
     - ``disk mcp``
     - Path where the MCP Server sends the logs.

       Set ``loggers`` to one or more of the following options:

       - ``disk``, which writes logs to disk files located in the path
         specified in the ``logPath`` option.
       - ``mcp``, which sends the logs to the AI client, if the client
         supports logging and transport protocol.
       - ``stderr``, which sends the logs to the standard error output.
         This setting is useful for debugging or when running MCP in a
         container.

       For example, to set ``loggers`` to ``mcp`` and ``stderr`` in the
       AI client JSON configuration file or the operating system command
       line, use ``--loggers mcp stderr``.

       To set the ``MDB_MCP_LOGGERS`` operating system environment
       variable to ``disk`` and ``stderr``, use ``export
       MDB_MCP_LOGGERS="disk,stderr"``.

       For more information about the logging options, see
       :ref:`mcp-server-configuration-troubleshooting`.

   * - ``logPath``
     - ``MDB_MCP_LOG_PATH``
     - string
     - Depends on the operating system
     - Directory that stores the MCP Server logs.

       .. note::
          Lock down the directory so the user running the MCP server owns it 
          with read/write permission. This prevents any other process from 
          accessing the server directories or files.

       For more information about the log path and operating system
       specifics, see :ref:`mcp-server-configuration-troubleshooting`.

   * - ``disabledTools``
     - ``MDB_MCP_DISABLED_TOOLS``
     - array
     - Not set
     - Array of MCP tool names, operation types, or tool
       categories to disable.

       For more information, see
       :ref:`mcp-server-configuration-disable-tools`.

   * - ``readOnly``
     - ``MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY``
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Flag that determines if write operations are permitted.
       To disable cluster write operations, set ``--readOnly`` in the
       configuration file or command line, or set the
       ``MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY`` operating system environment variable to
       ``true``. 

       **Default is to allow cluster write operations. Typically,
       always enable read-only mode.**

       For more information, see
       :ref:`mcp-server-configuration-read-only-mode`.

   * - ``indexCheck``
     - ``MDB_MCP_INDEX_CHECK``
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Flag that indicates if indexes are required for queries. If ``true``, 
       enforces that query operations must use an index and rejects queries
       that perform collection scans.

       For more information, see
       :ref:`mcp-server-configuration-index-check`.

   * - ``telemetry``
     - ``MDB_MCP_TELEMETRY``
     - string
     - ``enabled``
     - Flag that indicates if usage data is collected by the MCP Server.
       If ``disabled``, MCP Server usage data collection is stopped.

       For more information, see
       :ref:`mcp-server-configuration-telemetry`.

   * - ``transport``
     - ``MDB_MCP_TRANSPORT``
     - string
     - ``stdio``
     - Transport protocol for communications with the MCP Server.

       Set ``transport`` to one of the following options:

       - ``stdio``, which is the default. Uses the standard input and
         output for communications with the MCP Server. ``stdio`` is
         suitable for most AI clients.
       - ``http``, which enables HTTP communications with the MCP
         Server. You can then use HTTP to interact with the MCP Server
         from a Web client or communicate with the MCP Server on a
         specific HTTP IP port.

         .. warning::

            HTTP transport is **NOT** recommended for production use
            without implementing proper authentication and security
            measures.

   * - ``httpPort``
     - ``MDB_MCP_HTTP_PORT``
     - integer
     - ``3000``
     - IP port number for HTTP communications with the MCP Server.

   * - ``httpHost``
     - ``MDB_MCP_HTTP_HOST``
     - string
     - ``127.0.0.1``
     - IP address for HTTP communications with the MCP Server.

       With Streamable HTTP, the MCP Server is bound to ``localhost
       (127.0.0.1)`` by default. This ensures the MCP Server only accepts
       connections that originate on the same computer.

       .. warning::

          .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-security-risk.rst

       To learn more, see :ref:`mcp-remote-connections`.

   * - ``httpBodyLimit``
     - ``MDB_MCP_HTTP_BODY_LIMIT``
     - integer

     - Maximum size of the HTTP request body in bytes. Only applies to
       HTTP transport.

   * - ``healthCheckHost``
     - ``MDB_MCP_HEALTH_CHECK_HOST``
     - string
     - Not set
     - Host address for the separate healthCheck HTTP server. This is an
       HTTP endpoint that Kubernetes and Docker can use to check the health 
       of the MCP process. Only applies to HTTP transport.
       
       If provided, setting ``healthCheckPort`` is required.

   * - ``healthCheckPort``
     - ``MDB_MCP_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT``
     - integer
     - Not set
     - Port number for the separate healthCheck HTTP server. This is an
       HTTP endpoint that Kubernetes and Docker can use to check the health 
       of the MCP process. Only applies to HTTP transport.
       
       If provided, setting ``healthCheckHost`` is required.

   * - ``idleTimeoutMs``
     - ``MDB_MCP_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS``
     - integer
     - ``600000``
     - Idle timeout for a client to disconnect. Only applies to HTTP
       transport.

   * - ``notificationTimeoutMs``
     - ``MDB_MCP_NOTIFICATION_TIMEOUT_MS``
     - integer
     - ``540000``
     - Notification timeout for a client to be aware of disconnect. Only
       applies to HTTP transport.

   * - ``authenticationMechanism``
     - ``MDB_MCP_AUTHENTICATION_MECHANISM``
     - string
     - ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
     - Authentication mechanism to used when connecting to your MongoDB
       deployments with the MongoDB MCP Server.

       SCRAM is the default authentication mechanism for MongoDB. To connect
       using other authentication methods, see the following pages:

       - :ref:`mcp-server-oidc`
       - :ref:`mcp-server-ldap`
       - :ref:`mcp-server-kerberos`
       - :ref:`mcp-server-x509`
       - :ref:`mcp-server-proxy`

   * - ``exportsPath``
     - ``MDB_MCP_EXPORTS_PATH``
     - string
     - Depends on the operating system
     - Directory that stores exported data files.

       .. note::
          Lock down the directory so the user running the MCP server owns it 
          with read/write permission. This prevents any other process from 
          accessing the exported directories or files.

       For more information about the export path and operating system
       specifics, see :ref:`mcp-server-configuration-export-data`.

   * - ``exportTimeoutMs``

       files. The cleanup process is run automatically.

   * - ``previewFeatures``
     - ``MDB_MCP_PREVIEW_FEATURES``
     - string
     - Not set
     - Comma separated values of preview features that are enabled.
       Valid values: ``search``.

.. _mcp-vector-search-options:
.. _mcp-voyage-api-key:

Vector Search Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/note-vector-search-preview.rst

The following options configure the MCP server's behavior when you use it
to work with :ref:`MongoDB Vector Search <mcp-vector-search-tools>`.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 10 10 40

   * - CLI Option Name
     - OS Environment Variable Name
     - Type
     - Default
     - Description

   * - ``voyageApiKey``
     - ``MDB_MCP_VOYAGE_API_KEY``
     - string
     - Not set
     - Voyage AI API key for automatic embedding generation.

       When you configure this option, the MCP Server automatically generates
       embeddings for:

       - Documents that you insert with the ``insert-many`` tool
       - The ``queryVector`` parameter in :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`
         aggregation queries

       The MCP Server also validates that fields with vector search indexes
       contain valid embedding vectors to prevent
       breaking vector search indexes.

       The MongoDB MCP server supports the following Voyage AI
       models:

       - ``voyage-3-large``
       - ``voyage-3.5``
       - ``voyage-3.5-lite``
       - ``voyage-code-3``

       To learn more about Voyage AI, see the `Voyage AI
       documentation <https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings>`__.

       For additional vector search configuration options, see
       :ref:`mcp-vector-search-options`.

   * - ``embeddingsValidation``
     - ``MDB_MCP_EMBEDDINGS_VALIDATION``
     - boolean
     - ``true``
     - Flag that indicates if embedding vectors are validated. When set to
       ``true``, enables validation of embedding dimensions.

       By default, the MCP Server validates that fields with vector search
       indexes contain valid embedding vectors with the correct dimensions to
       prevent breaking vector search indexes. Disable this option to allow
       inserting raw values into embeddings fields without validation.

       .. warning::

          Disabling embeddings validation may result in documents
          with invalid embeddings that cannot be used with vector
          search indexes.

   * - ``vectorSearchDimensions``
     - ``MDB_MCP_VECTOR_SEARCH_DIMENSIONS``
     - integer
     - ``1024``
     - Default number of dimensions for vector search embeddings.

       This value is used when creating vector search indexes and
       validating embeddings.

   * - ``vectorSearchSimilarityFunction``
     - ``MDB_MCP_VECTOR_SEARCH_SIMILARITY_FUNCTION``
     - string
     - ``euclidean``
     - Default similarity function for vector search.
       Set to one of the following values:

       - ``euclidean``: Euclidean distance
       - ``cosine``: Cosine similarity
       - ``dotProduct``: Dot product similarity

       The MCP server uses this value is as the default when creating vector search
       indexes unless specified otherwise. To learn more, 
       see :ref:`avs-types-vector-search`.

.. _mcp-config-override-behavior-table:

Configuration Option Override Behaviors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes the override behavior of each configuration
option. These override behaviors apply only if the ``allowRequestOverrides``
configuration option is set to ``true``. If a user attempts to override a

.. _mcp-positional-arguments:

Positional Arguments
--------------------

The MCP Server accepts a positional argument that can be provided without
specifying a CLI flag. The first positional argument is interpreted as
the connection string for your MongoDB deployment. 

As a security best practice, use the ``MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING`` 
environment variable to set the connection string. If environment variables 
are not an option, use the first positional argument. For example:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   "args": [
      "-y",
      "mongodb-mcp-server",
      "mongodb+srv://<user-name>:<password>@<cluster-name>.mongodb.net/",
      "--readOnly"
   ]
