The ``/schema`` command provides information about your collection
schema by accessing your connected MongoDB deployment.

Example
-------

This example uses the ``users`` collection in the `Mflix Sample Database
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/#sample_mflix.users>`__.
Each document in the collection has the following structure:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      _id: {
         "$oid": "59b99db4cfa9a34dcd7885b6"
      },
      name: "Ned Stark",
      email: "sean_bean@gameofthron.es",
      password: "$2b$12$UREFwsRUoyF0CRqGNK0LzO0HM/jLhgUCNNIJ9RJAqMUQ74crlJ1Vu"
   }


If you are connected to a MongoDB deployment that contains this
collection, you can ask the |copilot| to show the schema of your collection:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   @MongoDB /schema Can you show the schema for the sample_mflix.users
   collection?

GitHub Copilot uses the |copilot| to generate the following response:

.. figure:: /images/copilot-schema.png
   :figwidth: 600px
   :alt: Screenshot of copilot generated a schema description
   
After Copilot generates the response, you can open the output in JSON format.
