Overview
--------

{+c2c-full-product-name+} connects MongoDB clusters and provides a way
to synchronize data between them. The tool that makes the connection is
:ref:`mongosync <c2c-mongosync>`. For more details, please see
the rest of the {+c2c-product-name+} documentation.

``mongosync`` syncs data between two clusters. 

- Each cluster can be a replica set or a sharded cluster.  If either
  is a sharded cluster, consult the :ref:`sharded cluster limitations
  <c2c-sharded-limitations>` for ``mongosync``.

- Sharded clusters are not required to have the same number of shards.

- The destination cluster must be the same version or up to two versions ahead
  of the source cluster. The patch version is not important, so long as they 
  meet the minimum patch :ref:`version requirements
  <c2c-server-version-compatibility>`.

Setup
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Define a source and a destination cluster

      .. _c2c-quickstart-define-clusters:

      If you already have a MongoDB cluster, either self-managed or
      hosted in :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </getting-started?jmp=docs>`, 
      use that cluster as the source cluster. If you don't have a
      cluster to work with, you will need to create one.

      This Quickstart works when the destination cluster and the source
      cluster are both replica sets. 
      
      To sync from a replica set to a sharded cluster, see 
      :ref:`c2c-rs-to-sharded`. To sync between sharded clusters, see
      :ref:`c2c-sharded-clusters`.

      .. seealso::

         You can migrate between clusters on the same or different
         MongoDB versions. For more information on MongoDB server 
         version compatibility or cross-version migrations, see
         :ref:`c2c-server-version-compatibility`. 

      The number of nodes in the destination replica set does not have
      to equal the number of nodes in the source replica set.

      .. important:: 
         
         .. include:: /includes/fact-oplog-disk-storage.rst

      If your clusters are self-managed, they must be MongoDB
      Enterprise clusters. {+c2c-product-name+} is only supported on
      MongoDB Community Edition in a limited number of cases. For more
      information on using {+c2c-product-name+} with MongoDB Community
      Edition, contact a MongoDB sales representative.

      Creating a cluster is beyond the scope of this guide. If you need
      help, refer to the documentation to create an :ref:`Atlas cluster
      <create-new-cluster>` or to create a :ref:`self-managed cluster
      <server-replica-set-deploy>`.

   .. step:: Define administrative users

      .. _c2c-quickstart-define-users:

      If either cluster is hosted in Atlas, or if either of them
      requires authentication, you must create a database user that has
      permissions in both clusters. 

      Source Cluster Authentication Requirements
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      The source user must have the following roles:

      - :authrole:`readAnyDatabase` role
      - :authrole:`clusterMonitor` role
      - :authrole:`backup` role

      In addition, the source user must be able to:

      - Run the :dbcommand:`getParameter` command

      If the source cluster is hosted in Atlas, the user must have the
      :ref:`Atlas admin <atlas-user-privileges>` role. The user must
      also be able to read the :ref:`change stream <changeStreams>` for
      the cluster.

      Destination Cluster Authentication Requirements
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      If the destination cluster is hosted in Atlas, the user must have
      the :ref:`Atlas admin <atlas-user-privileges>` role.

      Cluster Authentication Notes
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      - To add an Atlas user, see: :ref:`mongodb-users`.
      - To add a user to a self-managed cluster, see: :ref:`create-users`.
      - To verify user permissions, run :method:`db.getUser()`.

   .. step:: Download and install ``mongosync``

      .. _c2c-quickstart-download:

      ``mongosync`` is the tool that connects the source and
      destination clusters. You can host ``mongosync`` on its own
      hardware, ``mongosync`` does not have to run on the hardware that
      hosts your MongodDB clusters.

      To install ``mongosync``:
      
      #. Locate a host server for the ``mongosync`` executable that has
         network connectivity to your source and destination clusters.
      #. Go to the {+mdb-download-center+}.
      #. Download the ``mongosync`` package for your host system.
      #. Unpack the ``mongosync`` package. The ``mongosync`` executable
         is in the ``bin`` directory. 

      For operating system specific installation instructions, see
      :ref:`c2c-install`.

Connect the Clusters
--------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Format your connection strings

      A connection string contains the network and authentication
      details that ``mongosync`` needs to connect to the source and
      destination clusters.

      Determine the hostname or IP address and port for your source and
      destination clusters. You will use this information and the user
      authentication details to construct the connection strings. 

      The standard URI connection scheme has the form:

      .. code-block:: shell

         mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,...hostN[:portN]][/[defaultauthdb][?options]]

      Your connections strings will resemble:

      .. code-block:: shell

         cluster0:
         mongodb://clusterAdmin:superSecret@clusterOne01.fancyCorp.com:20020,clusterOne02.fancyCorp.com:20020,clusterOne03.fancyCorp.com:20020
         cluster1:
         mongodb://clusterAdmin:superSecret@clusterTwo01.fancyCorp.com:20020,clusterTwo02.fancyCorp.com:20020,clusterTwo03.fancyCorp.com:20020

      For more details, see :ref:`c2c-connecting`.

   .. step:: Initialize mongosync

      .. _c2c-initialize:
      
      ``mongosync`` must create an initial connection to the source and
      destination clusters before it can start to sync data. To create the initial
      connection, issue the following command with your connection
      strings on a single line (the command is
      reformatted here for clarity):

      .. code-block:: shell

         ./bin/mongosync \
               --logPath /var/log/mongosync \
               --cluster0 "mongodb://clusterAdmin:superSecret@clusterOne01.fancyCorp.com:20020,clusterOne02.fancyCorp.com:20020,clusterOne03.fancyCorp.com:20020" \
               --cluster1 "mongodb://clusterAdmin:superSecret@clusterTwo01.fancyCorp.com:20020,clusterTwo02.fancyCorp.com:20020,clusterTwo03.fancyCorp.com:20020"

Initialization Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- When ``mongosync`` first connects to the source and destination
  clusters it is in the :ref:`IDLE <c2c-states-descriptions>` state.
- ``mongosync`` does not synchronize data until it receives the
  :ref:`start <c2c-api-start>` command. 
- Designate the source and destination clusters with the :ref:`start
  <c2c-api-start>` command. "cluster0" and "cluster1" are just labels,
  either cluster can be ``cluster0`` or ``cluster1``.

.. _c2c-quickstart-synchronize:

Synchronize Data Between Clusters
---------------------------------

The :ref:`start <c2c-api-start>` endpoint initiates data synchronization.
To start syncing, use ``curl`` or a similar program to issue the
:ref:`start <c2c-api-start>` request:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/start.sh
   :language: shell

If the :ref:`start <c2c-api-start>` request is successful, ``mongosync``
returns ``{ "success": true }`` and starts to synchronize existing data on
the source cluster with the destination cluster. At this point,
``mongosync`` enters the ``RUNNING`` state and applies subsequent source
cluster writes to the destination cluster. 

To check the status of the sync, call the :ref:`progress
<c2c-api-progress>` endpoint:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/progress.sh
   :language: shell
   
If the ``progress`` response includes the
field ``canCommit: true``, the clusters are in sync and the destination
cluster continuously replicates data from the source cluster.

The command interface for ``mongosync`` is an HTTP server that publishes
an HTTP API. To control ``mongosync``, use the API endpoints. The API
documentation provides details on using the following endpoints:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Endpoint
     - Description
 
   * - :ref:`c2c-api-start`
     - Starts the synchronization between a source and destination
       cluster.
   * - :ref:`c2c-api-progress`
     - Returns the status of the synchronization process.
   * - :ref:`c2c-api-pause`
     - Pauses the current synchronization operation.
   * - :ref:`c2c-api-resume`
     - Resumes a paused synchronization session based on data stored on
       the destination cluster.
   * - :ref:`c2c-api-commit`
     - Commits the synchronization operation to the destination
       cluster.
   * - :ref:`c2c-api-reverse`
     - Reverses the direction of a committed sync operation.

Finalize Cutover Process
------------------------

You can finalize a migration and transfer your application
workload from the source to the destination cluster using the
``mongosync`` cutover process. 

For more information, see :ref:`c2c-cutover-process`.

One-Time Sync
-------------

After initializing data synchronization, call the :ref:`progress
<c2c-api-progress>` endpoint to see the status of the synchronization
process: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/progress.sh
   :language: shell

For a one time sync, verify that the ``progress`` response includes the
following field values:

- ``state: "RUNNING"``
- ``canCommit: true``
- ``lagTimeSeconds`` is near ``0`` (*Recommended, but not required*)

Then, call the :ref:`commit <c2c-api-commit>` endpoint to commit the
synchronization operation to the destination cluster and stop continuous
replication:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/commit.sh
   :language: shell

If the ``commit`` request is successful, ``mongosync`` returns 
``{ "success": true }`` and enters the ``COMMITTING`` state. After the sync
is complete, ``mongosync`` enters the ``COMMITTED`` state and the
clusters are no longer in continuous sync. 

Data Verification
-----------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-verification

Synchronization Notes
---------------------

- The default port for the HTTP API is ``27182``.  Use the ``--port``
  option with ``mongosync`` to :ref:`configure another port
  <c2c-config>`.

- ``mongosync`` can swap the source and destination clusters to enable
  :ref:`reverse synchronization <c2c-api-reverse>`.  
  
  For more information, see the :ref:`c2c-api-reverse` endpoint.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-permissions-body.rst

  To determine the correct the user permissions for your use case, see
  :ref:`c2c-permissions-and-roles`.

- You may need to increase the file descriptor ``ulimits`` on the host
  that is running ``mongosync``. This applies to any UNIX-like system,
  but macOS in particular has low defaults. See :ref:`UNIX ulimit
  settings <system-resource-utilization>`.

- To estimate the size of ``oplog`` needed for initial synchronization,
  see :ref:`c2c-oplog-sizing`.
