.. note::

   The following example queries the |index-name| index by 
   running the ``.aggregate`` command against the source 
   collection |source-collection|. During the Preview period, 
   you must query search indexes created on Views using the 
   source collection (|source-collection|) of the View. 
   If you query the View (|collection-name|),
   |product-name| returns no results.
