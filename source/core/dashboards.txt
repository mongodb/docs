Dashboards
==========

With |monitoring| dashboards, you can create customized collections of charts
for easier data analysis. You can configure |monitoring| to automatically load
a dashboard rather than the :guilabel:`Deployment` page.

You can create multiple dashboards as your needs dictate. Use the plus icon at
the top of the page to specify a name and create a new dashboard, or select
"New Dashboard..." when adding a chart to a dashboard . You can rename or
remove a dashboard from links on the bottom of a dashboard page.

Adding and Removing Charts from Dashboards
------------------------------------------

You can add charts from a host's :doc:`host's statistics page
</reference/host-statistics>` to your dashboards.

To add a chart to a dashboard, hover your mouse pointer over the chart to
display the chart controls. Then select the arrow control and select
:guilabel:`Add to Dashboard`.

To remove a chart from a dashboard, click the :guilabel:`Dashboard` tab
and select the dashboard. Then select the arrow above the chart and select
:guilabel:`Remove from Dashboard`.

Advanced Dashboard Creation
---------------------------

When adding a new dashboard, you can select the "``ADD CHART``" button
to create a dashboard that includes a custom
selection of charts, or a collection of charts from a dynamically
assembled list of hosts. From this page, you may create new dashboards
or append new charts to existing dashboards. You can filter the
included processes by :ref:`host type <host-types>`.

Specify the list of hosts to include in this dashboard by selecting a
replica set or shard cluster or writing a regular expression to match
monitored processes' hostnames. If checked, the "Host Alias In Regexp"
check box allows you to use the regular expression to select the
*aliased* hostname you configured, rather than the actual hostname.
Below the host configuration options you may toggle an option to "group
hosts in chart," which creates a single composite chart for all
matching charts.

Below this, there are 17 chart types that you can use to select charts
for this dashboard. Below the chart selection, the final row of
buttons allows you to: (optionally) test the "host regexp" to ensure
that your regular expression is sufficiently selective; preview the
charts that this operation will add to the dashboard; and submit these
changes to the dashboards.

You can add and remove charts to these dashboards manually. You may
also add additional charts using the "advanced create dashboard"
functionality by specifying an existing dashboard in the
first field.

Zoom to Navigate Chart Data
---------------------------

Click and drag on a chart, horizontally or vertically, to zoom and isolate a
specific data region. When a horizontal data region is selected, other charts
will automatically zoom to the same region. Double click on a chart to reset
zoom level.
