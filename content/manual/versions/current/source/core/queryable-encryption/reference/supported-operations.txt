This page documents the specific data types, commands, query operators, update
operators, aggregation stages, and aggregation expressions supported for
{+qe+} compatible drivers. It outlines the behavior for operations using
automatic encryption, and operations using {+manual-enc+}.

.. note:: Enterprise Feature

   Automatic encryption is available in MongoDB Enterprise and MongoDB Atlas

Operations Using ``BinData``
----------------------------

MongoDB stores {+qe+} encrypted fields as a :bsontype:`BinData <data_binary>`
blob. Read and write operations issued against the encrypted ``BinData`` value
may have unexpected or incorrect behavior as compared to issuing that same
operation against the decrypted value. Certain operations have strict BSON type
support where issuing them against a ``BinData`` value returns an error. 

Official drivers compatible with {+qe+} parse read and write
operations for operators or expressions that don't support ``BinData`` values.


.. _qe-commands-supported-bson-types:

Supported and Unsupported BSON Types
------------------------------------

{+qe+} supports equality queries against all :ref:`BSON types <bson-types>`
except for the following:

- ``double``
- ``decimal128``
- ``object``
- ``array``

{+qe+} supports range queries against the following :ref:`BSON types <bson-types>`:

- ``int``: 32-bit integer
- ``long``: 64-bit integer
- ``double``: Double (IEEE 754 Binary64)
- ``decimal``: Decimal (IEEE 754 Decimal128)
- ``date``: UTC DateTime (Int64)

CRUD
----

- {+qe+} doesn't support multi-document update or delete operations.
  :method:`db.collection.updateMany()` and :method:`db.collection.bulkWrite()` with more than one update or delete operation aren't supported.

- {+qe+} limits :method:`db.collection.findAndModify()` arguments.

  - ``fields`` is not allowed
  - ``new`` must be false

- When performing an upsert operation, any encrypted fields in the
  filter are excluded from the insert.

.. _qe-commands-supported-automatic-encryption:

Supported Read and Write Commands
---------------------------------

{+qe+} compatible drivers support automatic encryption with the
following commands:

- :dbcommand:`aggregate`
- :dbcommand:`count`
- :dbcommand:`delete`
- :dbcommand:`explain`
- :dbcommand:`find`
- :dbcommand:`findAndModify`
- :dbcommand:`insert`
- :dbcommand:`update`

For any supported command, the drivers return an error if
the command uses an unsupported operator, aggregation stage, or aggregation
expression. For a complete list of the supported operators, stages, and
expressions, see the following sections:

- :ref:`Supported Query Operators <qe-supported-query-operators>`
- :ref:`Supported Update Operators <qe-supported-update-operators>`
- :ref:`Supported Aggregation Stages <qe-supported-aggregation-stages>`
- :ref:`Supported Aggregation Expressions <qe-supported-aggregation-expressions>`

The following commands do not require automatic encryption. Official drivers
configured for automatic encryption pass these commands directly to the
:binary:`~bin.mongod`:

- :dbcommand:`getMore` [#]_
- :dbcommand:`authenticate`
- :dbcommand:`hello`
- :dbcommand:`logout`
- :dbcommand:`abortTransaction`
- :dbcommand:`commitTransaction`
- :dbcommand:`endSessions`
- :dbcommand:`startSession`
- :dbcommand:`create`
- :dbcommand:`createIndexes`
- :dbcommand:`drop`
- :dbcommand:`dropDatabase`
- :dbcommand:`dropIndexes`
- :dbcommand:`killCursors`
- :dbcommand:`listCollections`
- :dbcommand:`listDatabases`
- :dbcommand:`listIndexes`
- :dbcommand:`renameCollection`
- :dbcommand:`ping`

Issuing any other command through a compatible driver configured for automatic
encryption returns an error.

.. [#]

   While automatic encryption does not encrypt the getMore command, the response
   to the command may contain encrypted field values.

   - Applications configured with the correct {+qe+} options automatically decrypt
     those values.

   - Applications without the correct encryption options see the encrypted values.

.. _qe-supported-query-operators:

Supported Query Operators
-------------------------

Drivers configured for automatic encryption support a limited set of query
operators when issued against an encrypted queryable field.

Querying non-encrypted fields or encrypted fields with a supported query
type returns encrypted data that is then decrypted at the client.

{+qe+} currently supports ``none``, ``equality``, and ``range`` query types. If
the query type is unspecified, it defaults to ``none``. If the query type is
``none``, the field is  encrypted and clients can't query it.

.. important:: Comparison Support

   Comparison of an encrypted field to a plaintext value is supported.

   .. code-block:: json

      {$expr: {$eq: ["$encrypted1", "plaintext_value"]}}

   Comparison of one encrypted field to another encrypted field will fail.

   .. code-block:: json

      {$expr: {$eq: ["$encrypted1", "$encrypted2"]}}

Fields configured for ``queryType: "equality"`` support the following expressions:

- :query:`$eq`
- :query:`$ne`
- :query:`$in`
- :query:`$nin`
- :query:`$and`
- :query:`$or`
- :query:`$not`
- :query:`$nor`
- :query:`$expr`
- :query:`$exists`

Fields configured for ``queryType: "range"`` support the following expressions:

- :query:`$lt`
- :query:`$lte`
- :query:`$gt`
- :query:`$gte`
- :query:`$and`
- :query:`$exists`

Queries specifying any other query operator against an
encrypted field return an error.  

.. _qe-query-unsupported:

Unsupported Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Queries that compare an encrypted field to ``null`` or a regular expression
always throw an error, even if using a supported query operator.

When using a MongoClient configured for {+qe+}, the following query
operators throw an error, even if issued against an unencrypted field:

- :query:`$text`
- :query:`$where`
- :query:`$jsonSchema`

.. _qe-supported-update-operators:

Supported Update Operators
--------------------------

Drivers configured for automatic encryption support the following update operators
when issued against encrypted fields:

- :update:`$set`
- :update:`$unset`

Updates specifying any other update operator against an encrypted field
return an error.

Update operations with the following behavior throw an error, even if
using a supported operator:

- The update operation produces an array inside of an encrypted path.
- The update operation uses aggregation expression syntax.

For update operations specifying a :ref:`query filter <update-command-q>`
on encrypted fields, the query filter must use only :ref:`supported operators
<csfle-supported-query-operators>` on those fields.


Replacement-style Updates
-------------------------

Replacement-style updates are supported, however, if the replacement document
contains a ``Timestamp(0,0)`` inside a top-level encrypted field,
{+qe+} will error. The ``(0,0)`` value indicates that the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` should generate the Timestamp.  :binary:`~bin.mongod`
cannot generate encrypted fields.

.. _qe-supported-insert-operation:

Unsupported Insert Operations
-----------------------------

Compatible drivers configured for automatic encryption do not support insert
commands with the following behavior:

- Inserting a document with ``Timestamp(0,0)`` associated to an encrypted field.
  The ``(0,0)`` value indicates that the :binary:`~bin.mongod` should
  generate the Timestamp. Since the :binary:`~bin.mongod` cannot generate
  encrypted fields, the resulting timestamp would be unencrypted.

.. _qe-unsupported-aggregation-stages:

Unsupported Aggregation Stages
------------------------------

Automatic encryption will not support aggregation stages that read from or
write to additional collections. These stages are:

- :pipeline:`$out`
- :pipeline:`$merge`

.. _qe-supported-aggregation-stages:

Supported Aggregation Stages
----------------------------

Compatible drivers configured for automatic encryption support the following
aggregation pipeline stages:

- :pipeline:`$addFields`
- :pipeline:`$bucket`
- :pipeline:`$bucketAuto`
- :pipeline:`$collStats`
- :pipeline:`$count`
- :pipeline:`$geoNear`
- :pipeline:`$graphLookup` (For usage requirements, see 
  :ref:`qe-lookup-graphLookup-behavior`)
- :pipeline:`$group` on unencrypted fields
- :pipeline:`$indexStats`
- :pipeline:`$limit`
- :pipeline:`$lookup` (For usage requirements, see 
  :ref:`qe-lookup-graphLookup-behavior`)
- :pipeline:`$match`
- :pipeline:`$project`
- :pipeline:`$redact`
- :pipeline:`$replaceRoot`
- :pipeline:`$sample`
- :pipeline:`$skip`
- :pipeline:`$sort`
- :pipeline:`$sortByCount`
- :pipeline:`$unwind`

Aggregation pipelines operating on collections configured for automatic
encryption that specify any other stage return an error.

For each supported pipeline stage, MongoDB tracks fields that *must* be
encrypted as they pass through the supported pipelines and marks them
for encryption.

Each supported stage must specify only supported
:ref:`query operators <qe-supported-query-operators>` and
:ref:`aggregation expressions
<qe-supported-aggregation-expressions>`.

.. _qe-lookup-graphLookup-behavior:

``$lookup`` and ``$graphLookup`` Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 8.1, you can reference multiple encrypted collections in a 
:pipeline:`$lookup` stage. However, ``$lookup`` does not support: 

- Using an encrypted field as the join field in the ``localField`` or 
  ``foreignField``. 

- Using any field in an encrypted array. An array is considered as encrypted if 
  it contains any encrypted elements. 

  - For example, you can't use any field within the resulting 
    :ref:`as <lookup-eq-as>` array of the ``$lookup`` operation.

Automatic encryption supports :pipeline:`$graphLookup` *only if* the ``from`` 
collection matches the collection the aggregation runs against. ``$graphLookup`` 
stages that reference a different ``from`` collection return an error.

Automatic encryption does not support "connectionless" aggregation metadata
sources, which read metadata that doesn't pertain to a particular
collection, such as:

- :pipeline:`$currentOp`
- :ref:`changeStreams` for watching a database or the whole cluster
- :pipeline:`$listSessions`
- :pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`

Automatic encryption does not support the :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` stage
as the result may contain sensitive information.

.. _qe-supported-aggregation-expressions:

Supported Aggregation Expressions
---------------------------------

Compatible drivers configured for automatic encryption support the following
expressions against any equality query type encrypted fields:

- :expression:`$cond`
- :expression:`$eq`
- :expression:`$ifNull`
- :expression:`$in`
- :expression:`$let`
- :expression:`$literal`
- :expression:`$ne`
- :expression:`$switch`

All other aggregation expressions return an error if issued against
encrypted fields.

Aggregation stages with the following behavior return an error,
even if using a supported aggregation expression:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 30 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Expressions
     - Rejected Behavior
     - Example

   * - :expression:`$cond`

       :expression:`$switch`
     - The expression specifies a field whose encryption properties
       cannot be known until runtime *and* a subsequent aggregation
       stage includes an expression referencing that field.
     - .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          $addFields : {
            "valueWithUnknownEncryption" : {
              $cond : {
                if : { "$encryptedField" : "value" },
                then : "$encryptedField",
                else: "unencryptedValue"
              }
            }
          },
          {
            $match : {
              "valueWithUnknownEncryption" : "someNewValue"
            }
          }

   * - :expression:`$eq`

       :expression:`$ne`
     - The expression creates a new field that references an
       encrypted field *and* operates on that new field in the same
       expression.
     - .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          {
            $eq : [
              {"newField" : "$encryptedField"},
              {"newField" : "value"
            ]
          }

   * - :expression:`$eq`

       :expression:`$ne`
     - The expression references the prefix of an encrypted field
       within the comparison expression.
     - .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          { $eq : [ "$prefixOfEncryptedField" , "value"] }

   * - :expression:`$eq`

       :expression:`$ne`
     - The result of the expression is compared to an encrypted field.
     - .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          {
            $eq : [
                "$encryptedField" ,
                { $ne : [ "field", "value" ] }
            ]
          }

   * - :expression:`$let`
     - The expression binds a variable to an encrypted
       field or attempts to rebind :variable:`$$CURRENT <CURRENT>`.
     - .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          {
            $let: {
              "vars" : {
                "newVariable" : "$encryptedField"
              }
            }
          }

   * - :expression:`$in`
     - The first argument to the expression *is* an encrypted field,
       *and*

       - The second argument to the expression is *not* an array literal

         *-OR-*

       - The second argument to the expression is an encrypted field.
     - .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          {
            $in : [
              "$encryptedField" ,
              "$otherEncryptedField"
            ]
          }

Unsupported Field Types
-----------------------

Drivers configured for automatic encryption do *not* support any
read or write operation that requires encrypting the following value
types:

- :bsontype:`MaxKey`
- :bsontype:`MinKey`
- ``null``
- ``undefined``

{+qe+} does not adequately hide the type information for these values.

{+qe+} does not support automatic encryption on fields within an array of 
documents.

{+qe+} does not support read or write operations on an
encrypted field where the operation compares the encrypted field to the
following value types:

- ``array``
- ``decimal128``
- ``double``
- ``object``
