  .. versionchanged:: 2.3

  Though you do not need to create a .drdl schema file to use
  |bi-short|, you can if it meets your use case. To review the use
  cases, see :doc:`Map Relational Schemas to MongoDB
  </schema-configuration>`.

  If you wish to create a schema file, use the
  :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` command.

post: |
  .. note::
     The :option:`--host` option only accepts a hostname. You cannot
     provide a :ref:`MongoDB connection string <mongodb-uri>`.

  You can examine the generated ``schema.drdl`` file in a text editor
  and remove any fields or tables that are not part of your intended
  schema.

  For more information, see :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl`.
