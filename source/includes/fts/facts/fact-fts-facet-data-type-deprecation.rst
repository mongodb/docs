We are extending support for faceting on numeric and date fields using  
the :ref:`number <bson-data-types-number>` and :ref:`date
<bson-data-types-date>` types from August to September 2022. You must
migrate to the :ref:`numberFacet <bson-data-types-number-facet>` and 
:ref:`dateFacet <bson-data-types-date-facet>` types in all index
definitions for faceting on numeric and date fields, respectively.
