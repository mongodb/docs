.. dbcommand:: serverStatus

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns a document that
   provides an overview of the database's state. Monitoring
   applications can run this command at a regular interval to
   collect statistics about the instance.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1 } )

   The value (i.e. ``1`` above) does not affect the operation of the
   command. The :program:`mongo` shell provides the
   :method:`db.serverStatus()` wrapper for the command.

   .. seealso::

      Much of the output of :dbcommand:`serverStatus` is also displayed
      dynamically by :program:`mongostat`. See the
      :doc:`/reference/program/mongostat` command for more information.

Behavior
--------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/serverStatus-command-projection.rst

For example, the following operation suppresses the ``repl``,
``metrics`` and ``locks`` information in the output.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, repl: 0, metrics: 0, locks: 0 } )

The following example includes :ref:`server-status-range-deleter` and
all :ref:`server-status-repl` information in the output:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, rangeDeleter: 1, repl: 1 } )

Output
------

.. note::

   The output fields vary depending on the version of MongoDB,
   underlying operating system platform, the storage engine, and the
   kind of node, including :program:`mongos`, :program:`mongod` or
   :term:`replica set` member.

   For the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` output specific to the version of
   your MongoDB, refer to the appropriate version of the MongoDB Manual.

.. code-block:: javascript

   "asserts" : {
      "regular" : <num>,
      "warning" : <num>,
      "msg" : <num>,
      "user" : <num>,
      "rollovers" : <num>
   },

.. serverstatus:: asserts

   A document that reports on the number of assertions raised since the
   MongoDB process started. While assert errors are typically uncommon,
   if there are non-zero values for the :data:`asserts`, you should
   check the log file for more information. In many cases, these errors
   are trivial, but are worth investigating.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.regular

   The number of regular assertions raised since the MongoDB process
   started. Check the log file for more information about these
   messages.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.warning

   The number of warnings raised since the MongoDB process started.
   Check the log file for more information about these warnings.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.msg

   The number of message assertions raised since the MongoDB process
   started. Check the log file for more information about these
   messages.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.user

   The number of "user asserts" that have occurred since the last time
   the MongoDB process started. These are errors that user may
   generate, such as out of disk space or duplicate key. You can
   prevent these assertions by fixing a problem with your application
   or deployment. Check the MongoDB log for more information.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.rollovers

   The number of times that the rollover counters have rolled over
   since the last time the MongoDB process started. The counters will
   rollover to zero after 2\ :superscript:`30` assertions. Use this
   value to provide context to the other values in the
   :serverstatus:`asserts` data structure.

.. _server-status-backgroundflushing:
.. _server-status-background-flushing:

backgroundFlushing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   "backgroundFlushing" : {
      "flushes" : <num>,
      "total_ms" : <num>,
      "average_ms" : <num>,
      "last_ms" : <num>,
      "last_finished" : ISODate("...")
   },

.. note::

   ``backgroundFlushing`` information only appears for instances that
   use the :doc:`MMAPv1 </core/mmapv1>` storage engine.

.. serverstatus:: backgroundFlushing

   A document that reports on the :program:`mongod` process's periodic
   writes to disk. Consider these values if you have concerns about
   write performance and :ref:`journaling <journaling-status>`.


.. serverstatus:: backgroundFlushing.flushes

   The number of times the database has flushed all writes to disk.
   This value will grow as database runs for longer periods of time.

.. serverstatus:: backgroundFlushing.total_ms

   The total number of milliseconds (ms) that the :program:`mongod`
   processes have spent writing (i.e. flushing) data to disk. Because
   :serverstatus:`~backgroundFlushing.total_ms` is an absolute value,
   consider the :serverstatus:`~backgroundFlushing.flushes` and
   :serverstatus:`~backgroundFlushing.average_ms` values to provide
   context.

.. serverstatus:: backgroundFlushing.average_ms

   The average time in milliseconds for each flush to disk, calculated
   by dividing :serverstatus:`~backgroundFlushing.total_ms` by
   :serverstatus:`~backgeroundFlushing.flushes`.

   The :serverstatus:`~backgroundFlushing.average_ms` is more likely to
   to represent a "normal" time as the value of the
   :serverstatus:`~backgroundFlushing.flushes` increases. However,
   abnormal data can skew this value. Use the
   :serverstatus:`backgroundFlushing.last_ms` to check that a high
   average is not skewed by transient historical issue or a random
   write distribution.

.. serverstatus:: backgroundFlushing.last_ms

   The amount of time, in milliseconds, that the last flush operation
   took to complete. Use this value to verify that the current
   performance of the server is in line with the historical data
   provided by :serverstatus:`backgroundFlushing.average_ms` and
   :serverstatus:`backgroundFlushing.total_ms`.

.. serverstatus:: backgroundFlushing.last_finished

   The timestamp of the last completed flush operation in the
   :term:`ISODate` format. If this value is more than a few minutes
   past your server's current time and accounting for differences in
   time zone, restarting the database may result in some data loss.

   Also consider ongoing operations that might skew this value by
   routinely blocking write operations.

.. _server-status-connections:

connections
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   "connections" : {
      "current" : <num>,
      "available" : <num>,
      "totalCreated" : NumberLong(<num>)
   },

.. serverstatus:: connections

   A document that reports on the status of the connections. Use these
   values to assess the current load and capacity requirements of the
   server.

.. serverstatus:: connections.current

   The number of incoming connections from clients to the database
   server . This number includes the current shell session. Consider
   the value of :serverstatus:`connections.available` to add more
   context to this datum.

   The value will include all incoming connections including any shell
   connections or connections from other servers, such as
   :term:`replica set` members or :program:`mongos` instances.

.. serverstatus:: connections.available

   The number of unused incoming connections available. Consider this
   value in combination with the value of
   :serverstatus:`connections.current` to understand the connection
   load on the database, and the :doc:`/reference/ulimit` document for
   more information about system thresholds on available connections.

.. serverstatus:: connections.totalCreated

   Count of **all** incoming connections created to the server. This
   number includes connections that have since closed.

.. note::

   :serverstatus:`dur` (journaling) information only appears for
   :program:`mongod` instances that use the :doc:`MMAPv1
   </core/mmapv1>` storage engine and have journaling enabled.

.. serverstatus:: dur

   A document that reports the :program:`mongod` instance's
   :doc:`journaling-related operations </core/journaling>` and
   performance. MongoDB reports on this data based on 3 second
   intervals, collected between 3 and 6 seconds in the past.

.. serverstatus:: dur.commits

   during the last :ref:`journal group commit interval
   <journaling-record-write-operation>`.

.. serverstatus:: dur.writeToDataFilesMB

   The amount of data in megabytes (MB) written from :term:`journal` to
   the data files during the last :ref:`journal group commit interval
   <journaling-record-write-operation>`.

.. serverstatus:: dur.compression

   The compression ratio of the data written to the :term:`journal`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      ( journaled_size_of_data / uncompressed_size_of_data )

.. serverstatus:: dur.commitsInWriteLock

   The count of the commits that occurred while a write lock was held.
   Commits in a write lock indicate a MongoDB node under a heavy write
   load and call for further diagnosis.

.. serverstatus:: dur.earlyCommits

   The number of times MongoDB requested a commit before the scheduled
   :ref:`journal group commit interval
   <journaling-record-write-operation>`. Use this value to ensure that
   your :ref:`journal group commit interval
   <journaling-journal-commit-interval>` is not too long for your
   deployment.

.. serverstatus:: dur.timeMS

   A document that reports on the performance of the :program:`mongod`
   instance during the various phases of journaling in the last
   :ref:`journal group commit interval
   <journaling-journal-commit-interval>`.

.. serverstatus:: dur.timeMS.dt

   The amount of time, in milliseconds, over which MongoDB collected
   the :serverstatus:`dur.timeMS` data. Use this field to provide
   context to the other :serverstatus:`dur.timeMS` field values.

.. serverstatus:: dur.timeMS.prepLogBuffer

   The amount of time, in milliseconds, spent preparing to write to the
   journal. Smaller values indicate better journal performance.

.. serverstatus:: dur.timeMS.writeToJournal

   The amount of time, in milliseconds, spent actually writing to the
   journal. File system speeds and device interfaces can affect
   performance.

.. serverstatus:: dur.timeMS.writeToDataFiles

   The amount of time, in milliseconds, spent writing to data files
   after journaling. File system speeds and device interfaces can
   affect performance.

.. serverstatus:: dur.timeMS.remapPrivateView

   The amount of time, in milliseconds, spent remapping copy-on-write
   memory mapped views. Smaller values indicate better journal
   performance.

.. serverstatus:: dur.timeMS.commits

   The amount of time, in milliseconds, spent for commits.

.. serverstatus:: dur.timeMS.commitsInWriteLock

   The amount of time, in milliseconds, spent for commits that
   occurred while a write lock was held.

   "extra_info" : {
      "note" : "fields vary by platform.",
      "heap_usage_bytes" : <num>,
      "page_faults" : <num>
   },

.. serverstatus:: extra_info

   A document that provides additional information regarding the
   underlying system.

.. serverstatus:: extra_info.note

   A string with the text ``"fields vary by platform."``

.. serverstatus:: extra_info.heap_usage_bytes

   The total size in bytes of heap space used by the database process.
   Available on Unix/Linux systems only.

.. serverstatus:: extra_info.page_faults

   The total number of page faults. The
   :serverstatus:`extra_info.page_faults` counter may increase
   dramatically during moments of poor performance and may correlate
   with limited memory environments and larger data sets. Limited and
   sporadic page faults do not necessarily indicate an issue.

   Windows draws a distinction between "hard" page faults involving
   disk I/O, and "soft" page faults that only require moving pages in
   memory. MongoDB counts both hard and soft page faults in this
   statistic.

   operations queued because of a lock.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.currentQueue.total

   The total number of operations queued waiting for the lock (i.e.,
   the sum of :serverstatus:`globalLock.currentQueue.readers` and
   :serverstatus:`globalLock.currentQueue.writers`).

   A consistently small queue, particularly of shorter operations,
   should cause no concern. The
   :serverstatus:`globalLock.activeClients` readers and writers
   information provides contenxt for this data.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.currentQueue.readers

   The number of operations that are currently queued and waiting for
   the read lock. A consistently small read-queue, particularly of
   shorter operations, should cause no concern.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.currentQueue.writers

   The number of operations that are currently queued and waiting for
   the write lock. A consistently small write-queue, particularly of
   shorter operations, is no cause for concern.

.. serverstatus:: globalLock.activeClients

   A document that provides information about the number of connected
   clients and the read and write operations performed by these clients.

   Use this data to provide context for the
   :serverstatus:`globalLock.currentQueue` data.

   A document that reports for each lock ``<type>``, data on lock
   ``<modes>``.

   The possible lock ``<types>`` are:

   .. include:: /includes/fact-lock-types.rst

   The possible ``<modes>`` are:

   .. include:: /includes/fact-lock-modes.rst

   All values are of the ``NumberLong()`` type.

   .. COMMENT

      these definitions are for the servers and not per operations;

.. serverstatus:: locks.<type>.acquireWaitCount

   Number of times the :serverstatus:`locks.acquireCount` lock
   acquisitions encountered waits because the locks were held in a
   conflicting mode.

.. serverstatus:: locks.<type>.timeAcquiringMicros

   Cumulative wait time in microseconds for the lock acquisitions.

   :serverstatus:`locks.timeAcquiringMicros` divided by
   :serverstatus:`locks.acquireWaitCount` gives an
   approximate average wait time for the particular lock mode.

.. serverstatus:: locks.<type>.deadlockCount

   Number of times the lock acquisitions encountered deadlocks.

   },

.. serverstatus:: network

   A document that reports data on MongoDB's network use.

.. serverstatus:: network.bytesIn

   The number of bytes that reflects the amount of network traffic
   received *by* this database. Use this value to ensure that network
   traffic sent to the :program:`mongod` process is consistent with
   expectations and overall inter-application traffic.

   A document that reports on database operations by type since the
   :program:`mongod` instance last started.

   These numbers will grow over time until next restart. Analyze these
   values over time to track database utilization.

   .. note::

      The data in :serverstatus:`opcounters` treats operations
      that affect multiple documents, such as bulk insert or
      multi-update operations, as a single operation. See
      :serverstatus:`metrics.document` for more granular
      document-level operation tracking.

      Additionally, these values reflect received operations, and
      increment even when operations are not successful.

.. serverstatus:: opcounters.insert

   The total number of insert operations received since the
   :program:`mongod` instance last started.

.. serverstatus:: opcounters.query

   The total number of queries received since the :program:`mongod`

.. serverstatus:: opcountersRepl

   A document that reports on database replication operations by type
   since the :program:`mongod` instance last started.

   These values only appear when the current host is a member of a
   replica set.

   These values will differ from the :serverstatus:`opcounters` values
   because of how MongoDB serializes operations during replication.
   See :doc:`/replication` for more information on replication.

   These numbers will grow over time in response to database use until
   next restart. Analyze these values over time to track database
   utilization.

.. serverstatus:: opcountersRepl.getmore

   The total number of "getmore" operations since the :program:`mongod`
   instance last started. This counter can be high even if the query
   count is low. Secondary nodes send ``getMore`` operations as part of
   the replication process.

By default, :dbcommand:`serverStatus` does not include
:serverstatus:`rangeDeleter` data in the output. To include the
:serverstatus:`rangeDeleter` data, use one of the following commands:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.serverStatus( { rangeDeleter: 1 } )
   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, rangeDeleter: 1 } )

.. serverstatus:: rangeDeleter

   .. versionadded:: 3.0

   :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command and the cleanup phase of the
   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command.

.. serverstatus:: rangeDeleter.lastDeleteStats

   An array of documents that each report on the last operations of
   migration cleanup operations. At most
   :serverstatus:`rangeDeleter.lastDeleteStats` will report data
   for the last 10 operations.

.. serverstatus:: rangeDeleter.lastDeleteStats[n].deletedDocs

   The number of documents deleted by migration cleanup operations.

.. serverstatus:: rangeDeleter.lastDeleteStats[n].queueStart

   A timestamp that reflects when operations began entering the queue
   for the migration cleanup operation. Specifically, operations wait
   in the queue while the :program:`mongod` waits for open cursors to
   close on the namespace.

   An array of the current replica set members' hostname and port
   information (``"host:port"``).

.. serverstatus:: repl.setName

   A string with the name of the current replica set. This value
   reflects the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` command line
   argument, or :setting:`~replication.replSetName` value in the
   configuration file.

.. serverstatus:: repl.ismaster

   A boolean that indicates whether the current node is the
   :term:`primary` of the replica set.

.. serverstatus:: repl.secondary

   A boolean that indicates whether the current node is a
   :term:`secondary` member of the replica set.

.. serverstatus:: repl.primary

   To include this output, you must pass the ``repl`` option to the
   :dbcommand:`serverStatus`, as in the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.serverStatus({ "repl": 1 })
      db.runCommand({ "serverStatus": 1, "repl": 1 })

writeBacksQueued
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   "writeBacksQueued" : <boolean>,

.. serverstatus:: writeBacksQueued

   A boolean that indicates whether there are operations from a
   :program:`mongos` instance queued for retrying. Typically, this
   value is false.  See also :term:`writeBacks`.

   },


.. serverstatus:: mem

   A document that reports on the system architecture of the
   :program:`mongod` and current memory use.

.. serverstatus:: mem.bits

   A number, either ``64`` or ``32``, that indicates whether the
   MongoDB instance is compiled for 64-bit or 32-bit architecture.

.. serverstatus:: mem.resident

   The value of :serverstatus:`mem.resident` is roughly equivalent to
   the amount of RAM, in megabytes (MB), currently used by the database
   process. During normal use, this value tends to grow. In dedicated
   database servers, this number tends to approach the total amount of
   system memory.

.. serverstatus:: mem.virtual

   :serverstatus:`mem.virtual` displays the quantity, in megabytes
   (MB), of virtual memory used by the :program:`mongod` process.

   With :term:`journaling <journal>` enabled and if using MMAPv1
   storage engine, the value of :serverstatus:`mem.virtual` is at least
   twice the value of :serverstatus:`mem.mapped`. If
   :serverstatus:`mem.virtual` value is significantly larger than
   :serverstatus:`mem.mapped` (e.g. 3 or more times), this may indicate
   a memory leak.

.. serverstatus:: mem.supported

   A boolean that indicates whether the underlying system supports
   extended memory information. If this value is false and the system
   does not support extended memory information, then other
   :serverstatus:`mem` values may not be accessible to the database
   server.

.. serverstatus:: mem.mapped

   *Only for the MMAPv1 storage engine.*

   The amount of mapped memory, in megabytes (MB), by the database.
   Because MongoDB uses memory-mapped files, this value is likely to be
   to be roughly equivalent to the total size of your database or
   databases.

.. serverstatus:: mem.mappedWithJournal

   *Only for the MMAPv1 storage engine.*

   The amount of mapped memory, in megabytes (MB), including the memory
   used for journaling. This value will always be twice the value of
   :serverstatus:`mem.mapped`. This field is only included if
   journaling is enabled.

.. serverstatus:: mem.note

   The field :serverstatus:`mem.note` appears if
   :serverstatus:`mem.supported` is false.

   The :serverstatus:`mem.note` field contains the text: ``"not all mem
   info support on this platform"``.
