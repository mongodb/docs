About this Task
---------------

Dropping an `unnecessary index 
<http://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/schema-design-anti-pattern-unnecessary-indexes/>`_ 
can speed up CRUD operations. Each CRUD operation has to update all the 
indexes related to a document. Removing one index can increase the 
speed of all CRUD operations.  

When you drop a hashed shard key index, the server disables balancing 
for that collection and excludes the collection from future balancing
rounds. In order to include the collection in balancing rounds once
again, you must recreate the shard key index. 

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Stop the balancer
  
      Run the following command to stop the balancer:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.stopBalancer()

      You can only run ``sh.stopBalancer()`` on ``mongos``. 
      ``sh.stopBalancer()`` produces an error if run on ``mongod``.

   .. step:: Confirm there are no orphaned documents in your collection

      Run the following command to confirm no orphaned documents remain:

      .. code-block:: javascript
      
         db.runCommand(
            {
              cleanupOrphaned: "<database>.<collection>"
            }
         )

      ``cleanupOrphaned`` returns either ``1`` or ``0``.

      A value of ``1`` indicates that either:

      - No orphaned documents remain in the ``cleanupOrphaned`` namespace
        on the shard
      - The collection referenced in the ``cleanupOrphaned`` namespace is
        not sharded

      A value of ``0`` indicates that an error has occurred.
  
      Repeat this step until the command returns ``1``.

   .. step:: Drop the hashed shard key index 

      Run the following command to drop the index:
 
      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.collection.dropIndex("<index name>")

   .. step:: Restart the balancer

      Run the following command to restart the balancer on the cluster:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.startBalancer()
