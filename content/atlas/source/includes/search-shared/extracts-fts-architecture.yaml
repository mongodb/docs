  For testing and prototyping environments, we recommend a node architecture
  in which MongoDB processes and |fts| processes run on the same node. 
  In the following diagram of this deployment model, the |fts| ``mongot`` process runs alongside
  ``mongod`` on each node in the |service| {+cluster+} and they share the same resources.

  By default, |service| enables the |fts| ``mongot`` process on the same
  node that runs the ``mongod`` process when you create your first
  |product-name| index.
  
  When you run a query, |fts| uses the :ref:`configured read preference
  <replica-set-tags>` to identify the node on which to run the query. The
  query first goes to the MongoDB process, which is ``mongod`` for a
  replica set cluster or ``mongos`` for a sharded cluster.  

  For a replica set {+cluster+}, the ``mongod`` process routes the query to
  the ``mongot`` on the same node. For sharded clusters, your cluster data
  is partitioned across ``mongod`` instances (shards) and each ``mongot`` process
  can only access the data on the ``mongod`` instance on the same node.
  Therefore, you can't run |fts| queries that target a particular  shard. 
  ``mongos`` routes the query to all shards, making these *scatter gather*
  queries. If you use :manual:`zones </core/zone-sharding/>` to
  distribute a sharded collection over a subset of the shards in the
  {+cluster+}, |fts| routes the query to the zone that contains the
  shards for the collection that you are querying and runs your
  :pipeline:`$search` queries on just the shards where the collection is
  located.

  After the query is routed to a |fts| ``mongot`` process, the ``mongot`` process
  performs the search and scoring and returns the document IDs and other search metadata 
  for the matching results to its corresponding ``mongod`` process. The
  ``mongod`` process then performs a full document lookup implicitly for the
  matching results and returns the results to the client. If you use
  the :pipeline:`$search` :ref:`concurrent <concurrent-ref>` option in
  your query, |fts| enables intra-query parallelism. To learn more, see
  :ref:`Parallelize Query Execution Across Segments <concurrent-ref>`.

  To learn more about the ``mongot`` process, see :ref:`about-mongot`.

  When you enable |fts|, you can easily build search on top of your data
  with an integrated, fully managed search engine that automatically
  syncs to your database. |fts| provides a rich query language that uses
  |fts| aggregation pipeline stages like :pipeline:`$search` and
  :pipeline:`$searchMeta` for full-text search and
  :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` for semantic search in conjunction with 
  other MongoDB aggregation pipeline stages, and score-based results
  ranking.

  Depending on the resources provisioned for your {+cluster+}, deploying
  both processes on the same node might be more cost-efficient than running
  the search process on a separate, dedicated node.

ref: fts-architecture-decoupled
content: | 
  For production environments, we recommend a node architecture
  in which MongoDB processes and |fts| processes run on separate nodes.
  To deploy separate Search Nodes, see :ref:`fts-migrate-to-decoupled`.

  In the following diagram of this deployment model, the |fts| ``mongot`` process runs on dedicated 
  Search Nodes, which are separate from the {+cluster+} nodes on which the ``mongod``
  process runs.

     :figwidth: 100%
  
  |service| deploys Search Nodes with each {+cluster+} or
  with each shard on the {+cluster+}. For example, if you deploy two Search Nodes for a {+cluster+} with three
  shards, |service| deploys six Search Nodes (two per shard). You can also
  configure the number of Search Nodes and the amount of resources
  provisioned for each search node. 

  When you deploy separate Search Nodes, |service| automatically assigns a
  ``mongod`` for each ``mongot`` for indexing. The ``mongot`` communicates
  with the ``mongod`` to listen for and sync index changes for the indexes
  that it stores. |product-name| indexes and processes your queries
  similar to a deployment where both the ``mongod`` and ``mongot`` processes
  run on the same node. To learn more, see |index-doc| and |query-doc|. To
  learn more about deploying Search Nodes separately, see
  :ref:`configure-search-nodes`.

  When you migrate to Search Nodes, |service| deploys the Search Nodes,
  but doesn't serve queries on the nodes until it successfully builds
  all the indexes on the {+cluster+} on the Search Nodes. While
  |service| builds the indexes on the new nodes, it continues to serve
  queries using the indexes on the {+cluster+} nodes. |service| starts
  serving queries from the Search Nodes only after it successfully
  builds the indexes on the Search Nodes and removes the indexes on the
  {+cluster+} nodes.

  When you run a query, the query routes to the ``mongod`` based on
  the :ref:`configured read preference <replica-set-tags>`. The
  ``mongod`` process routes the search query through a load balancer on
  the same node, which distributes the requests across all of the
  ``mongot`` processes. 
  
  The |fts| ``mongot`` process performs the search and scoring and
  returns the document IDs and metadata for the matching results to
  ``mongod``. The ``mongod`` then performs a full document lookup for
  the matching results and returns the results to the client. If you use 
  the :pipeline:`$search` :ref:`concurrent <concurrent-ref>` option in
  your query, |fts| enables intra-query parallelism. To learn more, see
  :ref:`Parallelize Query Execution Across Segments <concurrent-ref>`.  

  If you delete all the Search Nodes on your {+cluster+}, there will be an
  interruption in processing your search query results. To learn more, see
  :ref:`Modify a Cluster <scale-cluster-cloud-provider>`. If you delete
  your |service| {+cluster+}, |service| pauses and then deletes all
  associated |product-name| deployments (``mongot`` processes).

  MongoDB supports separate Search Nodes on dedicated (``M10`` or higher)
  {+clusters+}. Search Nodes are deployed on compute-intensive NVMe
  instances. You must deploy a minimum of two nodes. You will be billed
  daily for hourly resource usage per node. To learn more, see
  :ref:`Search Node Costs <fts-search-node-costs>`.

ref: fts-stored-source-architecture
content: | 
  You can define :ref:`stored source <fts-stored-source-definition>` 
  fields in your |fts| index so that the ``mongot`` process can store the 
  specified fields on ``mongot``. You can then use the
  :ref:`returnStoredSource Option <fts-return-stored-source-option>` in 
  your |fts| query to retrieve the stored fields for matching documents
  directly from ``mongot`` instead of doing a full document lookup on the 
  database.
