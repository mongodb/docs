   If the config servers are replica sets:
      
   1. Upgrade the :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>`
      members of the replica set one at a time:

      a. Shut down the secondary :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and replace
         the |oldversion| binary with the |newversion| binary.

      #. Start the |newversion| binary with both the ``--configsvr`` and
         ``--port`` options:

         .. code-block:: bash

            mongod --configsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path> 

         If using a :doc:`configuration file

         specify :setting:`sharding.clusterRole: configsvr
         <sharding.clusterRole>` and :setting:`net.port` and start the
         |newversion| binary:

         Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.

      #. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before
         upgrading the next secondary member. To check the member's state,
         issue :method:`rs.status()` in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

         Repeat for each secondary member.

   #. Step down the replica set primary.

      a. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary and use
         :method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and force an
         election of a new primary:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            rs.stepDown()

      #. When :method:`rs.status()` shows that the primary has stepped
         down and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, shut down
         the stepped-down primary and replace the :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary
         with the |newversion| binary.

      #. Start the |newversion| binary with both the ``--configsvr`` and
         ``--port`` options:

         .. code-block:: bash

            mongod --configsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path>

  Replace each :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance with the |newversion| binary and
  restart. Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.


  .. note::

     In 3.4, :binary:`~bin.mongos` no longer supports  ``--chunkSize`` and
     ``--noAutoSplit`` runtime options (or the corresponding ``sharding.chunkSize``
     and ``sharding.autoSplit`` settings).  If your 3.2 :binary:`~bin.mongos`
     configuration includes these settings, remove the settings when running the 3.4
     :binary:`~bin.mongos`.
