The following tutorial uses the MongoDB installation wizard to install
|mdb-edition| {+version+} on Windows. To install using the
``msiexec.exe`` from the command line (``cmd.exe``), see
:doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows-unattended` instead.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/install-past-mongodb-enterprise-windows.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

Platform Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB requires x86-64 architecture and supports the following:

-  Windows 7/Server 2008 R2

- Windows 8/2012 R2 and later

See :ref:`mongodb-supported-platforms` for more information.

Windows Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows 2012 Server and Windows 10 need 
`KB2999226 <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows>`__ 
to provide Universal C Runtime support for Windows.

Production Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before deploying MongoDB in a production environment, consider the
:doc:`/administration/production-notes` document.

Install |mdb-edition|
---------------------

You can install |mdb-edition| using the Windows Installation wizard.
The installation process installs both the MongoDB binaries as well as
the default :doc:`configuration file
</reference/configuration-options>` :file:`<install
directory>\\bin\\mongod.cfg`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-mongodb-on-windows-enterprise-interactive.rst

If You Installed MongoDB as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB service is started upon successful installation [#cfg]_.

To begin using MongoDB, connect a :binary:`mongo.exe <bin.mongo>` shell
to the running MongoDB instance. Either:

- From Windows Explorer/File Explorer, go to ``C:\Program
  Files\MongoDB\Server\{+windows-dir-version+}\bin\`` directory and click on
  :binary:`mongo.exe <bin.mongo>`.

- Or, open a :guilabel:`Command Interpreter` with Administrative
  privileges and run:

  .. code-block:: bat

     "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+windows-dir-version+}\bin\mongo.exe"

For information on CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete)
operations, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/insert-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/query-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/update-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/remove-documents`

.. [#cfg]

   The MongoDB instance is configured using the configuration file
   :file:`<install directory>\\bin\\mongod.cfg`.

If You Did Not Install MongoDB as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you only installed the executables and did not install MongoDB as a
Windows service, you must manually start the MongoDB instance.

See :ref:`run-mongodb-enterprise-from-cmd` for instructions to start a
MongoDB instance.

.. _run-mongodb-enterprise-from-cmd:

Start |mdb-edition| from the Command Interpreter
------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/run-mongodb-on-windows.rst

.. _manually-create-windows-service-enterprise:

Start |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
----------------------------------------

Starting in version 4.0, you can install and configure MongoDB as a
:guilabel:`Windows Service` during the install, and the MongoDB service
is started upon successful installation.

To start/restart the MongoDB service, use the Services console:

#. From the Services console, locate the MongoDB service.

#. Right-click on the MongoDB service and click :guilabel:`Start`.

To begin using MongoDB, connect a :binary:`mongo.exe <bin.mongo>` shell
to the running MongoDB instance. To connect, open a :guilabel:`Command
Interpreter` with Administrative privileges and run:

.. code-block:: bat

   "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+windows-dir-version+}\bin\mongo.exe"

For more information on connecting a :binary:`mongo.exe <bin.mongo>`
shell, such as to connect to a MongoDB instance running on a different
host and/or port, see :doc:`/mongo`. For information on CRUD
(Create,Read,Update,Delete) operations, see:
     
- :doc:`/tutorial/insert-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/query-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/update-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/remove-documents`

You can also manually manage the service from the command line. To
start the MongoDB service from the command line, open a `Windows
command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-
commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`, and
run the following command:

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-manually-windows-service-for-mongodb.rst

Stop |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
----------------------------------------

To stop/pause the MongoDB service, use the Services console:

#. From the Services console, locate the MongoDB service.

#. Right-click on the MongoDB service and click :guilabel:`Stop` (or :guilabel:`Pause`).

You can also manage the service from the command line. To stop the
MongoDB service from the command line, open a `Windows command
prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-
commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`, and
run the following command:

.. code-block:: bat

   net stop MongoDB

Remove |mdb-edition| as a Windows Service
------------------------------------------

To remove the MongoDB service, first use the Services console to stop
the service. Then open a `Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd>`__ 
(``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`, and
run the following command:

.. code-block:: bat

   sc.exe delete MongoDB


Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Security
~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB binaries, :binary:`mongod.exe
<bin.mongod.exe>` and :binary:`mongos.exe <bin.mongos.exe>`, bind to
``localhost`` by default.

When bound only to the localhost, these binaries can only accept
connections from clients that are running on the same machine. Remote
clients cannot connect to the binaries bound only to localhost. For
more information, including how to override and bind to other ip
addresses, see :ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`.

Point Releases and ``.msi``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed MongoDB with the Windows installer (``.msi``), that
``.msi`` automatically upgrades within its :ref:`release series
<release-version-numbers>` (e.g. 4.0.1 to 4.0.2).

Upgrading a full release series (e.g. 4.0 to 4.2) requires a new
installation.

Add MongoDB binaries to the System PATH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All command-line examples in this tutorial are provided as absolute
paths to the MongoDB binaries. You can add ``C:\Program
Files\MongoDB\Server\{+windows-dir-version+}\bin`` to your System ``PATH`` and then
omit the full path to the MongoDB binaries.
