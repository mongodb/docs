   .. step:: Run an |fts| query with the ``compound`` operator on the ``movies`` collection. 

      a. Copy and paste the following query into the :guilabel:`Query
         Editor`.

               The query uses the :pipeline:`$search` ``compound``
               operator ``should`` clause to nest ``compound`` operator
               queries that perform the following actions:  

               - Searches for movies that contain the term ``ghost`` in the
                 plot or title (``must`` clause) and aren't in the ``comedy``
                 genre (``mustNot`` clause). 
               - Searches for movies that contain the term ``ghost`` in the
                 plot or title (``must`` clause), but reduces (``boost``) the
                 score by 50% (``0.5``) for movies in the ``comedy`` genre with
                 the term ``ghost`` in the title or plot.
