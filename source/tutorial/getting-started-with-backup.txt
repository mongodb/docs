===========================
Getting Started With Backup
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To get started with |backup|, you need to:

- :ref:`register for the service <tutorial-register-backup-service>`,

- :ref:`install |backup|
  <tutorial-install-backup-agent>`, and

- :ref:`start backing up the specific replica set(s)
  <tutorial-enable-backup-for-replica-set>`.

Once you have set up |backup|, you can:

- :ref:`restore from stored snapshots
  <tutorial-restore-from-stored-snapshot>` as well as

- :ref:`restore from any point in time within the last 24 hours
  <tutorial-restore-from-point-in-time>`.
