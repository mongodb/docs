This procedure describes how to configure rate limiting using 
the :parameter:`ingressConnectionEstablishmentRateLimiterEnabled` 
parameter in MongoDB. The rate limiter helps protect your deployment from 
connection storms that can impact system stability and performance.

Before You Begin 
----------------

Before you begin this procedure, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- You have administrative privileges on your MongoDB deployment
- You understand your system's connection load patterns and requirements
- You know your driver's :urioption:`connectTimeoutMS` setting

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
   
   .. step:: Enable the rate limiter
   
      To begin using the rate limiter, first enable it by setting the
      :parameter:`ingressConnectionEstablishmentRateLimiterEnabled` parameter to
      ``true``:
      
      .. code-block:: javascript
      
         db.adminCommand( {
            setParameter: 1,
            ingressConnectionEstablishmentRateLimiterEnabled: true
         } )
   
   .. step:: Set the connection establishment rate
      
      Set :parameter:`ingressConnectionEstablishmentRatePerSec` to the maximum rate
      that your cluster can handle without negatively impacting throughput. This should 
      be a fixed number that doesn't vary based on other workload dynamics.
      
      .. code-block:: javascript
      
         db.adminCommand( {
            setParameter: 1,
            ingressConnectionEstablishmentRatePerSec: 20
         } )
   
   .. step:: Configure the connection queue depth
      
      Set :parameter:`ingressConnectionEstablishmentMaxQueueDepth` according to
      the following formula:
      
      ``maxQueueDepth < (establishmentRatePerSec / 1000) * (connectTimeoutMs - ((averageTimeToCompletedHelloMicros-averageTimeQueuedMicros)*1000))``
      
      This formula ensures that:
      
      - New connection attempts do not remain in the queue past the time that the
        driver has abandoned them.
      - Most ``hello+auth`` attempts succeed, rather than failing due to a timeout
        error.
      
      The ``averageTimeQueuedMicros`` metric can assist in tuning 
      :parameter:`ingressConnectionEstablishmentMaxQueueDepth`, 
      as it equals approximately ``(maxQueueDepth / establishRatePerSec) * 1e6``.
      
      .. important::
      
         When tuning the queue size, prioritize a longer queue size, rather than a shorter 
         queue size. Drivers clearing their connection pools due to closed connections
         are a larger risk than connections remaining in the queue for too long and timing out.
   
   .. step:: Configure driver settings

      If you observe connection failures, decrease your driver's :urioption:`maxPoolSize` and 
      :urioption:`maxConnecting` settings. If you decrease these settings, the driver 
      reuses connections, rather than opening more connections to the server during 
      periods of increased latency, which can lead to connection storms.

      .. note:: 

         If you decrease ``maxPoolSize`` and ``maxConnecting``, queries may spend a 
         longer time at the driver layer waiting for a connection to be returned 
         to the pool. Decreasing these settings helps maintain availability 
         at the cost of increased latency during load spikes.

Monitoring and Troubleshooting
------------------------------

Monitor the following metrics to ensure you properly configure
your rate limiter: 

- :serverstatus:`queues.ingressSessionEstablishment`
- :serverstatus:`connections.establishmentRateLimit.rejected`

If you observe increasing numbers of rejected connections, consider:

1. Increasing :parameter:`ingressConnectionEstablishmentRatePerSec` if the cluster appears
   to have sufficient CPU resources to handle this load.
#. Adjusting :parameter:`ingressConnectionEstablishmentMaxQueueDepth` based on the formula.
#. Reviewing driver connection pool settings.
