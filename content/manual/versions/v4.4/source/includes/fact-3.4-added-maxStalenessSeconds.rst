Starting in version 3.4, MongoDB adds the :doc:`maxStalenessSeconds
</core/read-preference-staleness>` read preference option. The
``maxStalenessSeconds`` option lets you specify a maximum replication
lag, or "staleness", that :term:`secondaries <secondary>` can have and
still be eligible for read operations. When a secondary's estimated
staleness exceeds ``maxStalenessSeconds``, the secondary becomes
ineligible for read operations.
