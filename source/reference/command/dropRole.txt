Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: dropRole

   Deletes the role from the database on which you run the command. If
   the role is on a different database, you must switch to that database
   before you can remove the role. To run this command you must have the
   :authaction:`dropRole` action on the database.

   The :dbcommand:`dropRole` command uses the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        dropRole: "<role>",
        writeConcern: { <write concern> }
      }

   The command has the following fields:

   .. include:: /reference/command/dropRole-field.rst

Example
-------

The following sequence of commands in the :program:`mongo` shell removes
the ``readPrices`` role from the ``products`` database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use products
   db.runCommand( { dropRole: "readPrices", writeConcern: { w: "majority" } } )
