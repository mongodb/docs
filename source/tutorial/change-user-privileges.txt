======================
Modify User Privileges
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

A user's privileges determine the  :ref:`actions
<security-user-actions>` available to that user in the context of a
:ref:`resource <resource-document>`. Users receive privileges
through role assignments. A user can have multiple roles, and each role
can have multiple privileges.

Grant and revoke the user's roles using the :dbcommand:`grantRolesToUser`
and :dbcommand:`revokeRolesFromUser` commands.

For an overview of roles and privileges, see :ref:`authorization`.
