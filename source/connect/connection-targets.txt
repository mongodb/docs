Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use a connection string and a ``MongoClient`` 
object to connect to different types of MongoDB deployments.

.. tip::

   To learn more about how to retrieve your connection string, see 
   the :atlas:`Connect via Drivers </driver-connection>` guide in 
   the Atlas documentation.

Atlas
-----

To connect to a MongoDB deployment on Atlas, include the following elements
in your connection string:

- URL of your Atlas cluster
- MongoDB username
- MongoDB password

Then, pass your connection string to the ``MongoClient`` constructor.

When you connect to Atlas, we recommend using the {+stable-api+} client option to avoid
breaking changes when Atlas upgrades to a new version of {+mdb-server+}.
To learn more about the {+stable-api+} feature, see the :ref:`<nodejs-stable-api>`
guide.

The following code shows how to use the {+driver-short+} to connect to an Atlas cluster. The
code also uses the ``server_api`` field to specify a {+stable-api+} version.

   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start-connection-target-atlas
   :end-before: end-connection-target-atlas

Local Deployments
-----------------

To connect to a local standalone MongoDB deployment, specify the host of the 
server. Optionally, specify the port of the server. If no port is specified, 
the default port is ``27017``. 

You can specify the host and port to connect to by using a  
connection string, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-targets.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start-local-connection-uri
   :end-before: end-local-connection-uri
   :dedent:

You can also specify your host as ``localhost``. The following code example 
connects to ``localhost`` on the specified port:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-targets.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start-localhost
   :end-before: end-localhost
   :dedent:

Replica Sets
------------

To connect to a replica set, we recommend that you specify all nodes that are 
part of the replica set. If one or more nodes becomes unavailable,
specifying all nodes allows the driver to still connect to the replica set 
if one node is available.

However, it is sufficient to pass the address of any one node in the replica set 
to the driver. The node does not need to be the primary, and it may be a hidden node. 
The driver will then automatically discover the remaining nodes.

The following example shows how to connect to the replica set by using a connection
string and how to verify the replica set name on connection by using the 
``replicaSet`` connection string option:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-targets.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start-replica-set-option
   :end-before: end-replica-set-option
   :dedent:

API Documentation
-----------------

To learn more about creating a ``MongoClient`` object with the {+driver-short+},
see the API documentation for `MongoClient <{+api+}/classes/MongoClient.html>`__ .
