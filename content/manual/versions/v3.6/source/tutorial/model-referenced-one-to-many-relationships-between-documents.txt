Overview
--------

Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections
<collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. Decisions
that affect how you model data can affect application performance and
database capacity. See :doc:`/core/data-models` for a full high
level overview of data modeling in MongoDB.

This document describes a data model that uses :ref:`references
<data-modeling-referencing>` between documents to describe
relationships between connected data.

Pattern
-------

Consider the following example that maps publisher and book
relationships. The example illustrates the advantage of referencing
over embedding to avoid repetition of the publisher information.

Embedding the publisher document inside the book document would lead to
**repetition** of the publisher data, as the following documents show:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 7-11,20-24

   {
      title: "MongoDB: The Definitive Guide",
      author: [ "Kristina Chodorow", "Mike Dirolf" ],
      published_date: ISODate("2010-09-24"),
      pages: 216,
      language: "English",
      publisher: {
                 name: "O'Reilly Media",
                 founded: 1980,
                 location: "CA"
               }
   }

   {
      title: "50 Tips and Tricks for MongoDB Developer",
      author: "Kristina Chodorow",
      published_date: ISODate("2011-05-06"),
      pages: 68,
      language: "English",
      publisher: {
                 name: "O'Reilly Media",
                 founded: 1980,
                 location: "CA"
               }
   }

To avoid repetition of the publisher data, use *references* and keep
the publisher information in a separate collection from the book
collection.

When using references, the growth of the relationships determine where
to store the reference. If the number of books per publisher is small
with limited growth, storing the book reference inside the publisher
document may sometimes be useful. Otherwise, if the number of books per
publisher is unbounded, this data model would lead to mutable, growing
arrays, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 5

   {
      name: "O'Reilly Media",
      founded: 1980,
      location: "CA",
      books: [123456789, 234567890, ...]
   }

   {
       _id: 123456789,
       title: "MongoDB: The Definitive Guide",
       author: [ "Kristina Chodorow", "Mike Dirolf" ],
       published_date: ISODate("2010-09-24"),
       pages: 216,
       language: "English"
   }

   {
      _id: 234567890,
      title: "50 Tips and Tricks for MongoDB Developer",
      author: "Kristina Chodorow",
      published_date: ISODate("2011-05-06"),
      pages: 68,
      language: "English"
   }

To avoid mutable, growing arrays, store the publisher reference inside
the book document:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 15, 25

   {
      _id: "oreilly",
      name: "O'Reilly Media",
      founded: 1980,
      location: "CA"
   }

   {
      _id: 123456789,
      title: "MongoDB: The Definitive Guide",
      author: [ "Kristina Chodorow", "Mike Dirolf" ],
      published_date: ISODate("2010-09-24"),
      pages: 216,
      language: "English",
      publisher_id: "oreilly"
   }

   {
      _id: 234567890,
      title: "50 Tips and Tricks for MongoDB Developer",
      author: "Kristina Chodorow",
      published_date: ISODate("2011-05-06"),
      pages: 68,
      language: "English",
      publisher_id: "oreilly"
   }

.. Reworked the Queue slide from the presentation to Atomic Operation
.. TODO later, include a separate queue example for maybe checkout requests,
   and possibly bucket example that is separate from the pre-allocation
   example link above in the Document Growth section
