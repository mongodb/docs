The examples on this page demonstrate how to use the MongoDB Query API
in an |service| Function to aggregate documents in your |service| cluster.

MongoDB :manual:`aggregation pipelines </core/aggregation-pipeline>` run
all documents in a collection through a series of data :ref:`aggregation
stages <atlas-mongodb-aggregation-stages>` that allow you to filter and shape
documents as well as collect summary data about groups of related
documents.

.. note:: Supported Aggregation Stages

   |service| Functions support nearly all MongoDB aggregation pipeline stages and
   operators, but some stages and operators must be executed within a
   :ref:`system function <atlas-system-functions>`. See :ref:`Aggregation Framework
   Limitations <atlas-functions-aggregation-framework-limitations>` for more
   information.

Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~

The examples on this page use a collection named ``store.purchases``
that contains information about historical item sales in an online
store. Each document contains a list of the purchased ``items``,
including the item ``name`` and the purchased ``quantity``, as well as a
unique ID value for the customer that purchased the items.

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: The JSON schema for store.purchases

  {
    "title": "Purchase",
    "required": ["_id", "customerId", "items"],
    "properties": {
      "_id": { "bsonType": "objectId" },
      "customerId": { "bsonType": "objectId" },
      "items": {
        "bsonType": "array",
        "items": {
          "bsonType": "object",
          "required": ["name", "quantity"],
          "properties": {
            "name": { "bsonType": "string" },
            "quantity": { "bsonType": "int" }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

Run an Aggregation Pipeline
---------------------------

You can execute an aggregation pipeline using the
:method:`collection.aggregate()` method.

The following :ref:`Function <atlas-functions>` snippet groups all documents
in the ``purchases`` collection by their ``customerId`` value and
aggregates a count of the number of items each customer purchases as
well as the total number of purchases that they made. After grouping the
documents the pipeline adds a new field that calculates the average
number of items each customer purchases at a time,
``averageNumItemsPurchased``, to each customer's document:

Find Data with |service| Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run :ref:`|service| Search <fts-top-ref>` queries on a collection
with :method:`collection.aggregate()` and the ``$search`` aggregation
stage.

.. important::

   |service| Functions perform ``$search`` operations as a system user and
   enforce field-level rules on the returned search results. This means that a
   user may search on a field for which they do not have read access. In this
   case, the search is based on the specified field but no returned documents
   include the field.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input::
      :language: javascript

      exports = async function searchMoviesAboutBaseball() {
        // 1. Get a reference to the collection you want to search.
        const movies = context.services
          .get("mongodb-atlas")
          .db("sample_mflix")
          .collection("movies");
        // 2. Run an aggregation with $search as the first stage.
        const baseballMovies = await movies
          .aggregate([
            {
              $search: {
                text: {
                  query: "baseball",
                  path: "plot",
                },
              },
            },
            {
              $limit: 5,
            },
            {
              $project: {
                _id: 0,
                title: 1,
                plot: 1,
              },
            },
          ])
          .toArray();
        return baseballMovies;
      };

   .. output::
      :language: json

      {
        "plot" : "A trio of guys try and make up for missed
        opportunities in childhood by forming a three-player
        baseball team to compete against standard children
        baseball squads.",
        "title" : "The Benchwarmers"
      }
      {
        "plot" : "A young boy is bequeathed the ownership of a
        professional baseball team.",
        "title" : "Little Big League"
      }
      {
        "plot" : "A trained chimpanzee plays third base for a
        minor-league baseball team.",
        "title" : "Ed"
      }
      {
        "plot" : "The story of the life and career of the famed
        baseball player, Lou Gehrig.",
        "title" : "The Pride of the Yankees"
      }
      {
        "plot" : "Babe Ruth becomes a baseball legend but is
        unheroic to those who know him.",
        "title" : "The Babe"
      }

.. note:: $$SEARCH_META Variable Availability

   The :atlas:`$$SEARCH_META </atlas-search/query-syntax/#aggregation-variable>`
   aggregation variable is only available for Functions that :ref:`run as system
   <atlas-system-functions>` or if the first role on the searched collection has its
   ``apply_when`` and ``read`` expressions set to ``true``.

   If neither of these two scenarios apply, ``$$SEARCH_META`` is undefined and
   the aggregation will fail.

.. _atlas-mongodb-aggregation-stages:

Aggregation Stages
------------------

Filter Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage
to filter incoming documents using standard MongoDB :manual:`query syntax
</tutorial/query-documents>`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "$match": {
       "<Field Name>": <Query Expression>,
       ...
     }
   }

.. example::

   The following ``$match`` stage filters incoming documents to include
   only those where the ``graduation_year`` field has a value between
   ``2019`` and ``2024``, inclusive.


   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "$match": {
          "graduation_year": {
            "$gte": 2019,
            "$lte": 2024
          },
        }
      }

Group Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :manual:`$group
</reference/operator/aggregation/group/>` stage to aggregate summary
data for groups of one or more documents. MongoDB groups documents based
on the ``_id`` expression.

.. note::

   You can reference a specific document field by prefixing the field
   name with a ``$``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "$group": {
       "_id": <Group By Expression>,
       "<Field Name>": <Aggregation Expression>,
       ...
     }
   }

.. example::

   The following ``$group`` stage groups documents by the value of their
   ``customerId`` field and calculates the number of purchase documents
   that each ``customerId`` appears in.


   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "$group": {
          "_id": "$customerId",
          "numPurchases": { "$sum": 1 }
        }
      }

Project Document Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :manual:`$project
</reference/operator/aggregation/project/>` stage to include or omit
specific fields from documents or to calculate new fields using
:manual:`aggregation operators </reference/operator/aggregation>`.
To include a field, set its value to ``1``. To omit a field, set its
value to ``0``.

.. note::

   You can't simultaneously omit and include fields other than ``_id``.
   If you explicitly include a field other than ``_id``, any fields you
   did not explicitly include are automatically omitted (and
   vice-versa).

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "$project": {
       "<Field Name>": <0 | 1 | Expression>,
       ...
     }
   }

.. example::

   The following ``$project`` stage omits the ``_id`` field, includes
   the ``customerId`` field, and creates a new field named ``numItems``
   where the value is the number of documents in the ``items`` array:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "$project": {
          "_id": 0,
          "customerId": 1,
          "numItems": { "$sum": { "$size": "$items" } }
        }
      }

Add Fields to Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :manual:`$addFields
</reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/>` stage to add new fields
with calculated values using :manual:`aggregation operators
</reference/operator/aggregation>`.

.. note::

   ``$addFields`` is similar to :manual:`$project
   </reference/operator/aggregation/project/>` but does not allow you to
   include or omit fields.

.. example::

   The following ``$addFields`` stages creates a new field named
   ``numItems`` where the value is the number of documents in the
   ``items`` array:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "$addFields": {
          "numItems": { "$sum": { "$size": "$items" } }
        }
      }

Unwind Array Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :manual:`$unwind
</reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/>` stage to aggregate
individual elements of array fields. When you unwind an array field,
MongoDB copies each document once for each element of the array field
but replaces the array value with the array element in each copy.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     $unwind: {
       path: <Array Field Path>,
       includeArrayIndex: <string>,
       preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: <boolean>
     }
   }

.. example::

   The following ``$unwind`` stage creates a new document for each
   element of the ``items`` array in each document. It also adds a field
   called ``itemIndex`` to each new document that specifies the
   element's position index in the original array:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "$unwind": {
          "path": "$items",
          "includeArrayIndex": "itemIndex"
        }
      }

   Consider the following document from the ``purchases`` collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        _id: 123,
        customerId: 24601,
        items: [
          { name: "Baseball", quantity: 5 },
          { name: "Baseball Mitt", quantity: 1 },
          { name: "Baseball Bat", quantity: 1 },
        ]
      }

   If we apply the example ``$unwind`` stage to this document, the stage
   outputs the following three documents:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        _id: 123,
        customerId: 24601,
        itemIndex: 0,
        items: { name: "Baseball", quantity: 5 }
      }, {
        _id: 123,
        customerId: 24601,
        itemIndex: 1,
        items: { name: "Baseball Mitt", quantity: 1 }
      }, {
        _id: 123,
        customerId: 24601,
        itemIndex: 2,
        items: { name: "Baseball Bat", quantity: 1 }
      }
