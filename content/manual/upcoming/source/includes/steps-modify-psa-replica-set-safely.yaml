title: Add or modify a secondary with votes 1 but priority 0
stepnum: 1
ref: modify-psa-replica-set-add-or-modify
pre: |
  To avoid rolling back uncommitted writes when adding or changing a
  voting, data-bearing node, it is required that you add the node with
  ``{ priority: 0 }`` first.

  In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, modify the replica set configuration. To
  reconfigure an existing replica set, first retrieve the current
  configuration with :method:`rs.conf()`, modify the configuration
  document as needed, and then pass the modified document to
  :method:`rs.reconfig()`:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
     cfg = rs.conf();
     cfg["members"] = [
       {
          // existing member or members
       },
       {
          "_id" : <num>,  // The array position of the new member in the
                          // ``members`` array.
          "host" : <host>,
          "arbiterOnly" : false,
          "buildIndexes" : true,
          "hidden" : false,
          "priority" : 0,
          "tags" : { <tags> },
          "secondaryDelaySecs" : <num>,
          "votes" : 1
       },
       {
          // existing member or members
       }
     ]
     rs.reconfig(cfg);

title: Reconfigure the secondary to have non-zero priority
stepnum: 2
ref: modify-psa-replica-set-reconfigure
pre: |
  Once the secondary is caught up, set the prority to the desired
  number. Before this reconfiguration succeeds, the secondary must
  replicate all the writes that were committed when it had zero votes.
  This is automatically checked when you issue the
  :method:`rs.reconfig()` command.

action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
     cfg = rs.conf();
     cfg["members"] = [
       {
          // existing member or members
       },
       {
          "_id" : <num>,  // The array position of the new member in the
                          // ``members`` array.
          "host" : <host>,
          "arbiterOnly" : false,
          "buildIndexes" : true,
          "hidden" : false,
          "priority" : <num>,
          "tags" : { <tags> },
          "secondaryDelaySecs" : <num>,
          "votes" : 1
       },
       {
          // existing member or members
       }
     ]
     rs.reconfig(cfg);
