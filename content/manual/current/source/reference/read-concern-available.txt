============================
Read Concern ``"available"``
============================

.. meta::
   :description: Using read concern "available" returns data with no guarantee that the data has been written to a majority of the replica set members. Read concern "available" can return orphaned documents.
   :keywords: read isolation

A query with read concern ``"available"`` returns data from the instance
with no guarantee that the data has been written to a majority of the
replica set members (i.e. may be rolled back).

- **For a sharded cluster**, :readconcern:`"available"` read concern
  provides greater tolerance for partitions.

  Queries with the :readconcern:`"available"` read concern don't require a
  check to ensure that the correct shard received the query.

  In the event of network partitions, these queries route to the shard 
  considered appropriate before the network partition occurred.  They do not
  wait for consistency guarantees from servers that may be unavailable.  If
  the shard was undergoing chunk migration, queries with 
  :readconcern:`"available"` can return :term:`orphaned documents
  <orphaned document>`.

  .. warning::

     :program:`mongos` does not guarantee that queries with read concern
     :readconcern:`"available"` route to the correct shards.  The shard that
     receives the query returns data, but this shard may not be the
     authoritative owner of the requested data.

     This can cause queries to return incorrect or unexpected results.

- **For unsharded collections** (including collections in a standalone
  deployment or a replica set deployment), :readconcern:`"local"` and
  :readconcern:`"available"` read concerns behave identically.

Availability
------------

Read concern :readconcern:`"available"` is :red:`unavailable for use`
with causally consistent sessions and transactions.

Then, the following tables summarizes the state of the data that a read
operation with :readconcern:`"available"` read concern would see at
