.. note::

   For information on changing a user's password prior to version 2.5.3,
   see :v2.4:`Change a User's Password in the v2.4 Manual
   </tutorial/change-user-password>`.

.. NOTE the primary reason for the above note is that the 2.4 page includes
   info on changes between 2.2 and 2.4, changes we don't want to document here.
