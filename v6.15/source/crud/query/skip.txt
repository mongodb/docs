Overview
--------

Use ``skip`` to omit documents from the beginning of the list of
returned documents for a read operation. You can combine ``skip`` with
:doc:`sort </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/sort>` to omit the top
(for descending order) or bottom (for ascending order) results for a
given query. Since the :manual:`order of documents returned
</reference/method/cursor.sort/#result-ordering>` is not guaranteed in
the absence of a sort, using ``skip`` without using ``sort`` omits
arbitrary documents.

If the value of ``skip`` exceeds the number of matched documents for
a query, then that query returns no documents.

Sample Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To follow the examples in this guide, use the following code snippet to insert documents
that describe fruits into the ``myDB.fruits`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const myDB = client.db("myDB");
   const myColl = myDB.collection("fruits");

   await myColl.insertMany([
     { "_id": 1, "name": "apples", "qty": 5, "rating": 3 },
     { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas", "qty": 7, "rating": 1 },
     { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges", "qty": 6, "rating": 2 },
     { "_id": 4, "name": "avocados", "qty": 3, "rating": 5 },
   ]);

Example
-------

In the following example, we query the collection with a filter that
matches all the documents and pass options that specifies ``sort`` and
``skip`` commands as query options. The sort option specifies that fruit
documents that have higher ``rating`` values are returned before ones with lower
ratings. The skip option specifies that the first 2 documents are
omitted from the result:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // define an empty query document
   const query = {};
   const options = {
      // sort in descending (-1) order by rating
      sort : { rating: -1 },
      // omit the first two documents
      skip : 2,
   }

   const cursor = myColl.find(query, options);
   for await (const doc of cursor) {
     console.dir(doc);
   }

Since we specified that query skip the first ``2`` documents, the third and fourth highest
rating documents are printed by the code snippet above:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges", "qty": 6, "rating": 2 }
   { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas", "qty": 7, "rating": 1 }


The ``sort`` and ``skip`` options can also be specified as methods chained to
the ``find`` method. The following two commands are equivalent:

.. code-block:: javascript

   myColl.find(query, { sort: { rating: -1}, skip: 2});
   myColl.find(query).sort({rating: -1}).skip(2);
