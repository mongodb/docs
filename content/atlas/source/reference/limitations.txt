|service| Limits
----------------

|service| limits the number of the following items:

- Components of particular type that you can create.
- Connections allowed to a {+database-deployment+}. For
  {+clusters+}, the number of connections allowed depends on the
  {+cluster+} tier.
- |global-write-cluster| shard keys per :ref:`project <projects>`. Each
  |service| project supports up to 40 |global-write-cluster| shard keys.
  If you require multiple |global-write-clusters| and might exceed
  this limit, deploy each additional |global-write-cluster| in a
  separate project.

|service| {+Flex-Cluster+} Limits
-------------------------------------------------------

{+Flex-clusters+} have certain :ref:`configuration limits 
<flex-limits-config>`, :ref:`operational limits 
<flex-limits-ops>`, and :ref:`driver requirements 
<flex-limits-drivers>`. To learn more, see :ref:`flex-cluster-limitations`.

|service| M0 ({+Free-Cluster+}) Limits
----------------------------------------

{+Free-clusters+} have certain :ref:`configuration limits 
<shared-limits-config>`, :ref:`operational limits 
<shared-limits-ops>`, and :ref:`driver requirements 
<shared-limits-drivers>`. To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`.

Commands
--------

Not all commands are supported on all tiers, and |service| supports some 
commands only on |starter|.

- Some commands have :ref:`limits or are unsupported <free-tier-command-limitations>` 
  on |starter|. To learn more about these unsupported commands, refer to 
  :ref:`unsupported-commands`.
- Some commands have :ref:`limits on M10+ {+clusters+} <limited-commands-paid>`, 
  or are :ref:`unsupported on M10+ {+clusters+} <unsupported-commands-paid>`. To 
  learn more about these commands, refer to :ref:`free-tier-commands`.
