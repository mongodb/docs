Scanning an index is much faster than scanning a collection. The indexes structures are smaller than the documents reference, and store references in order."

The operator increments the value of the field on the server side, as an alternative to selecting a document, making simple modifications in the client and then writing the entire document to the server.  The :update:`$inc` operator can also help avoid race conditions, which would result when two application instances queried for a document, manually incremented a field, and saved the entire document back at the same time."
