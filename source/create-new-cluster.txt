Introduction
------------

A MongoDB cluster is a set of MongoDB nodes that make up a :term:`replica set` or
:term:`sharded cluster`. Your group can have multiple clusters. |service|
provisions clusters on the latest stable release of MongoDB and uses the
:ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>` storage engine.

When creating a cluster, you select the options described in the steps below.
As you build your cluster, |service| displays the associated costs. When you
complete the cluster, you enter your :doc:`payment information </billing>`.

During configuration, you create the admin username and password. The admin
user has read and write access to any database in the cluster. |service| can generate
the password for you. If you choose to have |service| do this, you must copy and save
the password when it is displayed. |service| displays it only once.

.. important::

   You must save the admin
   password or you will lose admin access to your cluster until you reset the password.

.. ? Perhaps if there are any ramifications if you are already an
   existing cloud mgr user, maybe a sentence about that. But I'm guessing not?
