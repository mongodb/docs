Security Checklist

*Last updated: 2019-12-05*

This documents provides a list of security measures that you should
implement to protect your MongoDB installation. The list is not meant
to be exhaustive.

Pre-production Checklist/Considerations
---------------------------------------

.. _checklist-auth:

|arrow| Enable Access Control and Enforce Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 95

   * -

     - Enable access control and specify the authentication mechanism.
       You can use MongoDB's SCRAM or x.509 authentication mechanism or
       integrate with your existing Kerberos/LDAP infrastructure. Authentication
       requires that all clients and servers provide valid credentials
       before they can connect to the system.

       See :doc:`/core/authentication` and
       :doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication`.

.. _security-checklist-role-based-access-control:

|arrow| Configure Role-Based Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 95

   * -

     - Create a user administrator **first**, then create additional
       users. Create a unique MongoDB user for each person/application
       that accesses the system.
       
       |
       
       Follow the principle of least privilege. Create roles that
       define the exact access rights required by a set of users. Then
       create users and assign them only the roles they need to perform
       their operations. A user can be a person or a client application.

       .. tip::

          A user can have privileges across different databases. If a
          user requires privileges on multiple databases, create a
          single user with roles that grant applicable database
          privileges instead of creating the user multiple times in
          different databases.

       See :doc:`/core/authorization` and
       :doc:`/tutorial/manage-users-and-roles`.

|arrow| Encrypt Communication (TLS/SSL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 95

   * -

     - Configure MongoDB to use TLS/SSL for all incoming and outgoing
       connections. Use TLS/SSL to encrypt communication between
       :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` components of a
       MongoDB deployment as well as between all applications and
       MongoDB.

       See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.

|arrow| Encrypt and Protect Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 95

   * -

     - Starting with MongoDB Enterprise 3.2, you can encrypt data in
       the storage layer with the WiredTiger storage engine's native
       :doc:`/core/security-encryption-at-rest`.

   * -

     - If you are not using WiredTiger's encryption at rest, MongoDB
       data should be encrypted on each host using file-system, device,
       or physical encryption (e.g. dm-crypt). Protect MongoDB data
       using file-system permissions. MongoDB data includes data files,
       configuration files, auditing logs, and key files.

   * -

     - Collect logs to a central log store. These logs contain DB
       authentication attempts including source IP address.
       
       
|arrow| Limit Network Exposure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 95

   * -

     - Ensure that MongoDB runs in a trusted network environment and
       configure firewall or security groups to control inbound and
       outbound traffic for your MongoDB instances.
      
       Allow only trusted clients to access the network interfaces and
       ports on which MongoDB instances are available. For instance,
       use IP whitelisting to allow access from trusted IP addresses (see )

       .. note::

          .. include:: /includes/fact-default-bind-ip-change.rst

       See:
       
       - :doc:`/core/security-hardening` 

       - :setting:`net.bindIp` configuration setting
       
       - :setting:`security.clusterIpSourceWhitelist` configuration setting

       - :ref:`authenticationRestrictions
         <db-createUser-authenticationRestrictions>` to specify
         per-user IP whitelist.

   * -

     - Disable direct SSH root access.


|arrow| Audit System Activity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 95

   * -

     - Track access and changes to database configurations and data.
       `MongoDB Enterprise
       <http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?jmp=docs>`_ 
       includes a system auditing facility that can record
       system events (e.g. user operations, connection events) on a
       MongoDB instance. These audit records permit forensic analysis
       and allow administrators to verify proper controls. You can set
       up filters to record specific events, such as authentication
       events.

       See :doc:`/core/auditing` and
       :doc:`/tutorial/configure-auditing`.

|arrow| Run MongoDB with a Dedicated User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 95

   * -

     - Run MongoDB processes with a dedicated operating system user
       account. Ensure that the account has permissions to access data
       but no unnecessary permissions.

       See :doc:`/installation` for more information on running MongoDB.

|arrow| Run MongoDB with Secure Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 95

   * -

     - MongoDB supports the execution of JavaScript code for certain
       server-side operations: :dbcommand:`mapReduce`,
       :dbcommand:`group`, and :query:`$where`. If you do not use these
       operations, disable server-side scripting by using the
       :option:`--noscripting <mongod --noscripting>` option on the
       command line.

   * -

     - Keep input validation enabled. MongoDB enables input validation
       by default through the :setting:`net.wireObjectCheck` setting.
       This ensures that all documents stored by the
       :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance are valid :term:`BSON`.

.. see::

   :doc:`/core/security-hardening`.

|arrow| Request a Security Technical Implementation Guide (where applicable)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 95

   * -

     - The Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) contains
       security guidelines for deployments within the United States
       Department of Defense. MongoDB Inc. provides its STIG, upon
       request, for situations where it is required. Please `request a
       copy <http://www.mongodb.com/lp/contact/stig-requests>`_ for
       more information.

|arrow| Consider Security Standards Compliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 95

   * -

     - For applications requiring HIPAA or PCI-DSS compliance, please
       refer to the `MongoDB Security Reference Architecture
       <https://www.mongodb.com/collateral/mongodb-security-architecture>`_
       to learn more about how you can use the key security
       capabilities to build compliant application infrastructure.


Periodic/Ongoing Production Checks
----------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :widths: 5 95

   * -

     - Periodically check for `MongoDB Product CVE
       <https://www.mongodb.com/alerts>`_ and upgrade your products .

   * -

     - Consult the `MongoDB end of life dates
       <https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy>`_ and upgrade your
       MongoDB installation. In general, try to stay on the latest
       version.

   * -

     - Ensure that your information security management system policies
       and procedures extend to your MongoDB installation, including
       performing the following:

       - Periodically apply patches to your machine and review
         guidelines.

       - Review policy/procedure changes, especially changes to your
         network rules to prevent inadvertent MongoDB exposure to the
         Internet.

       - Review MongoDB database users and periodically rotate them.
