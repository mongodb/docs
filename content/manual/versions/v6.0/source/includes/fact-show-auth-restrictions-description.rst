Optional. Set this field to ``true`` to include :ref:`authentication
restrictions <create-role-auth-restrictions>` in the output.
Authentication restrictions indicate the IP addresses that users with
this role can connect to and from.

By default, this field is ``false``, meaning that the |getRoleMethod|
output does not include authentication restrictions.
