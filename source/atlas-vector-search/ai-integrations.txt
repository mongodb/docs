{+avs+} integrates with popular |llm|\s and frameworks through
their standard |api|\s. MongoDB and partners also provide 
specific product integrations to help you leverage {+avs+}
in your generative AI and AI-powered applications. 

This page includes examples of integrations that MongoDB and 
partners provide to help you develop AI applications. 
For a complete list of integrations and partner services, 
see :ref:`explore-ecosystem`.

Key Concepts
------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-ai-key-concepts.rst

Frameworks
----------

You can integrate {+avs+} with the following open-source 
frameworks to build |llm| applications.

LangChain
~~~~~~~~~

`LangChain <https://langchain.com/>`__ is a framework
designed to simplify the creation of |llm| applications
through the use of "chains," which are LangChain-specific
components that can be combined together for a variety of use 
cases.

By integrating {+avs+} with LangChain, you can use 
|service| as a vector database, use {+avs+} to perform similarity 
search over your data, and implement |rag| by chaining together 
{+avs+} as a retriever.

To get started, see :ref:`langchain`.
