You can implement multi-tenancy with |service| so that a single instance 
of an application serves multiple tenants. Your initial design 
decisions for a multi-tenant architecture can have unintended effects
over time as requirements evolve or scaling expectations change.

The best approach might depend on the following factors:
 
- Projected scaling requirements (number of tenants and their data use)
- Security and isolation requirements
- Uniformity or variability of data requirements across tenants

Consider these factors as you decide on the best approach to use for 
your multi-tenant architecture.

.. note:: 

   For {+avs+}-specific recommendations,
   see :ref:`avs-multi-tenancy`.

Overview
--------

When you design a multi-tenant architecture, consider the following 
approaches:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 40 40
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * -
     - :ref:`tenant-per-db`
     - :ref:`all-tenants-single` 

   * - Description
     - If you have a small and stable number (up to a few 
       hundred) tenants with varied data requirements and strict access 
       control requirements, consider one database per tenant.
     - If you expect an indefinitely growing number of tenants, and the 
       structure of data and query requirements is relatively 
       consistent across tenants, consider having the tenants' 
       data coexist in shared collections within a single database. You 
       can use a ``tenantId`` field in each document to logically 
       segment data between tenants.
   
   * - Benefits
     - - Database user can limit tenant data access.

       - You can set up indexing to account for unique access patterns 
         for variable data structures across tenants.

       - You can migrate or scale an entire tenant's isolated data to 
         new resources.
     - - Highly scalable
 
       - Simplifies ongoing maintenance
   
   * - Considerations
     - You might:
      
       - Add more complexity for the application tier.
        
       - Have redundant collections and indexes across 
         tenants.

       - Encounter problems at scale in a single {+cluster+}. 
 
     - - A single database user could access this large pool of 
         multi-tenant data.
  
       - The segmentation of data is purely logical and must be 
         enforced in the application tier.
 
Avoid :ref:`all-tenants-own-collection`.

.. important:: Security Considerations

   In all of the following approaches, you build a multi-tenant 
   architecture in a single {+cluster+}. You share the replication 
   :term:`oplog` and user data across all tenants, which might result 
   in potential security concerns. To secure data partitioning, you 
   must deploy a single small replica set for each tenant with unique 
   authentication.

.. _tenant-per-db:

Each Tenant in its Own Database
-------------------------------

If you have a small and stable number (up to a few 
hundred) tenants with varied data requirements and strict access 
control requirements, consider creating one database per tenant.

This approach has the following benefits:

- For added security, the database user can limit tenant data 
  access. |service| limits :ref:`100 database users per project 
  <org-project-limits>` by default.

- To account for unique access patterns for variable data 
  structures across tenants, you can set up indexing.

- To move a single tenant onto its own dedicated resources, 
  you can migrate or scale an entire tenant's isolated data to new 
  resources (for example, another {+cluster+}).
   
Consider that you might:
      
- Add more complexity for the application tier.
        
- Have redundant collections and indexes across 
  tenants.

- Encounter problems at scale in a single {+cluster+}. 
  The underlying data files required for each new collection and 
  index consume computational resources. 

Each tenant has its own *logical* database on the same {+cluster+}. 
This approach allows for easy customization and strong security. 
It permits backups and maintenance actions for one tenant without 
impacting the others.

However, this approach can increase the setup effort and needed 
computational resources. Interactions between tenants require 
connections to multiple databases. Some MongoDB commands work only 
between collections in the same database.

Each collection and index is stored on disk as a separate file, which 
can lead to a very large number of open files and high memory usage. To 
mitigate this, use less than 1000 data files (collections and 
individual indexes) per node. To learn more, see 
:ref:`cluster-collection-limits`.

.. _all-tenants-single:

All Tenants in a Single Database with Shared Collections
--------------------------------------------------------

If you expect an indefinitely growing number of tenants, the structure 
of data and query requirements is relatively consistent across 
tenants, and you have less strict access control requirements, consider 
using a single database with shared collections for all tenants.

This approach has the following benefits:

- Highly scalable (for example, you can shard the {+cluster+})
 
- Simplifies ongoing maintenance (for example, indexing for new 
  query patterns) 
   
Consider the following potential issues:
 
- A single database user could access this large pool of multi-tenant 
  data.

- The segmentation of data is purely logical and must be enforced in 
  the application tier.

All tenants can have documents in all collections. The multi-tenancy 
logic exists in the application layer. Every document must have a 
``tenantId`` field, and every database query must filter by that field. 
You must manage security at the application level.

You might encounter scaling issues in the long-term. Any maintenance 
that you perform affects all tenants at the same time. While this 
approach works well for many small tenants of the same size, it doesn't 
work well if the tenant sizes vary. Also, you might find 
customizing the settings for each tenant difficult.

.. _all-tenants-own-collection:

All Tenants with their Own Collections in a Single Database
-----------------------------------------------------------

Avoid putting all tenants with their own collections into a single 
database. While this approach prevents customization issues, it 
complicates the application coding, and exacerbates scaling issues in 
the long-term.
