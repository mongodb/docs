  By default, MongoDB stores its data files in {{mongodDatadir}} and its
  log files in ``/var/log/mongodb``, and runs using the {{mongodUser}}
  account. You can specify alternative log and data directories using in
  the MongoDB instance's :manual:`configuration file
  </reference/configuration-options/>`. This tutorial uses the default
  data and log file paths.
