title: Shut down all members of the replica set.
ref: shutdown-repset
level: 4
pre: |
  Shut down each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the replica set, starting with the 
  :term:`secondaries<secondary>`. Continue until *all* members of the 
  replica set are offline, including any :term:`arbiters<arbiter>`. 
  The :term:`primary` must be the *last* member shut down to avoid 
  potential rollbacks.

  To shut down a :binary:`~bin.mongod`, connect each :binary:`~bin.mongod` using
  :binary:`~bin.mongosh` and issue the :method:`db.shutdownServer()` on the 
  ``admin`` database:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    use admin
    db.shutdownServer()
post: |
  At the end of this step, *all* members of the replica set should be offline.

title: Restart each member of the replica set with access control enforced. 
ref: enable-auth
level: 4
pre: |
   Restart *each* :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the replica set with either the
   :setting:`security.keyFile` configuration file setting or the
   ``--keyFile`` command-line option. Running :binary:`~bin.mongod` with
   the ``--keyFile`` command-line option or the
   :setting:`security.keyFile` configuration file setting enforces both
   :doc:`/core/security-internal-authentication` and
   :doc:`/core/authorization`.

title: Connect to the primary using the localhost interface.
level: 4
ref: connect-via-localhost
pre: |
  Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to one of the 
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances over the :ref:`localhost
  interface<localhost-exception>`. You must run :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
  on the same physical machine as the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

  Use :method:`rs.status()` to identify the :term:`primary` replica set
  member. If you are connected to the primary, continue to the next
  step. If not, connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the primary
  over the :ref:`localhost
  interface<localhost-exception>`.

  .. important:: You must connect to the :term:`primary` before proceeding.

  The cluster administrator user has the :authrole:`clusterAdmin` role,
