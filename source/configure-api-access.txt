To access the |service| |api|, generate an
:ref:`API key <atlas-prog-api-key>` for your organization.

.. admonition:: Personal API Key Deprecation
   :class: important

   |service| has deprecated :ref:`Personal API Keys <atlas-personal-api-key>`.
   You cannot create new Personal |api| Keys, but existing Personal
   |api| Keys continue to function.

.. admonition:: Programmatic API Keys can't use the |mms| Console
   :class: note

   Organization |api| keys aren't associated with user credentials and
   can't log in to the |service| user interface.

.. _configure-access-to-whitelisted-ops:
.. _whitelist-for-api-operations:

Enable API Whitelisting for Your Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For |service| users with a non-empty |api| whitelist, all |api|
access must originate from a whitelisted |ipv4| address. Ensure your
configured whitelist entries provide appropriate coverage for all
clients which require |api| access. An empty |api| whitelist grants
access to all |api| endpoints except those that explicitly require
whitelisting.

You can configure |service| to require |api| whitelisting at the
organization level. When this setting is enabled, all |api| calls
within that organization must originate from an entry on each
respective |service| userâ€™s |api| whitelist. For organizations that
require |api| whitelisting, |service| users cannot access any |api|
operations until they define at least one |api| whitelist entry.

To require an |api| whitelist for an Organization:

.. include:: /includes/steps/require-ip-whitelist.rst

For a description of the |service| |api|'s principles and conventions,
see the :doc:`/api`.

.. _atlas-prog-api-key:

Programmatic API Keys
---------------------

To grant programmatic access to an organization or project using only
the :doc:`API </api>`, you can create an |api| key. |api| keys:

- Have two parts: a Public Key and a Private Key.

- Cannot be used to log into |service| through the user interface.

- Must be granted roles as you would Users to make sure the |api| Keys
  can call |api| endpoints without errors.

- Can belong to one organization, but may be granted access to
  any number of projects in that organization.

Personal API Keys (Deprecated)
------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-personal-apikeys-deprecated-ui.rst

You can no longer create Personal |api| Keys. You can manage any
Personal |api| Keys that you have currently.

To manage any existing personal |api| keys:

.. include:: /includes/steps/view-personal-api-keys.rst

When accessing |service| through the |api|, you have the same level of
access as you do through the |service| interface. Your |service| roles
apply to both the interface and the |api|.

Limit API Operations to Whitelisted IPv4 Addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To access whitelisted |api| operations, you must configure your
:ref:`API whitelist <whitelist-for-api-operations>` with the |ipv4|
addresses from which you will issue the whitelisted commands. You also
must have the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role to issue whitelisted
commands.

Address-based whitelists protect |api| operations. Only client requests
that originate from a whitelisted |ipv4| address are permitted to
perform the operations.

Users have their own whitelists and own |api| keys. When you issue an
|api| call, you must use an |api| key from your user account and must
issue the command from an address on your user account's whitelist. You
cannot use your key to issue a whitelisted |api| request from an
address on another user's whitelist, unless, of course, you've added
that address to your own whitelist.

On the :doc:`resources </reference/api-resources>` pages in this guide,
whitelisted operations are marked as such.
