$vectorSearch (aggregation)
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

``$vectorSearch`` performs a semantic search on data in your Atlas
cluster. If you store vector embeddings that are less than or equal to
4096 dimensions in width for any kind of data along with other data in
your collection on the Atlas cluster, you can seamlessly index the
vector data along with your other data. You can then use the
:pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage to pre-filter your data and perform
semantic search against the indexed fields. 

.. important:: 

   The ``$vectorSearch`` aggregation pipeline stage is only available
   for collections hosted on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` cluster tiers 
   running MongoDB version 6.0.11 or later. To learn more, see 
   :atlas:`Atlas Vector Search
   </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>`. 

.. note::

   You cannot use a ``$vectorSearch`` stage in a :pipeline:`$facet`
   stage.
