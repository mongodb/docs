Create an |service| User Account
--------------------------------

To get started with |service|, create your user account and log in to
|service|. If you are an existing |mms-full| user, you can use your |mms|
credentials.

.. note::

   Similar to |mms|, creating a user for |service| also creates the user on
   `jira.mongodb.org <http://jira.mongodb.org>`_. If you later change the
   user's password or email address in |service|, you will also
   change the password or email address in `jira.mongodb.org
   <http://jira.mongodb.org>`_.

Once logged in, create an |service| project.

.. _create-project:

Create an |service| Project
---------------------------

Your project will manage your MongoDB deployments. You can give other
|service| users access to your project, allowing them to log into the
project and manage your deployments.

Once you log in to |service|, create a new |service| project (if you are
an existing |mms| user, you can create a new |service| project from
|mms|; for details, see :ref:`cm-create-atlas-project`):
