Monitoring Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do I need a Monitoring Agent for every MongoDB instance?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

No. In your |mms| group, a single Monitoring Agent connects to all
MongoDB databases. Configure firewalls to allow the
Monitoring Agent to connect across data centers and servers.

Beginning with Monitoring Agent version 5.0.0, you can run multiple agents to
to distribute monitoring assignments and provide failover. |mms| distributes
monitoring assignments among up to 100 running Monitoring Agents. If you run
more than 100 Monitoring Agents, the additional agents behave as "standby"
agents. For more information, see :ref:`multiple-monitoring-agents`.

   .. note:: Also beginning with Monitoring Agent version 5.0.0,
             **Cloud Manager Premium** uses 10-second granularity
             for monitoring metrics.

Where should I run the Monitoring Agent?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The amount of resources the Monitoring Agent requires varies depending on
infrastructure size, the number of servers and the databases it is monitoring. Run
the agent on an existing machine with additional capacity that *does not* run a
:program:`mongod` instance. You may also run the Monitoring Agent
on a smaller dedicated instance.

The Monitoring Agent load scales with the number of monitored ``mongod`` plus
``mongos`` processes and the number of databases in your MongoDB environment.

Never install the Monitoring Agent on the same server as a
data bearing :program:`mongod` instance. This will allow you to
perform maintenance on the :program:`mongod` and its host without
affecting the monitoring for your deployment. Additionally, a
Monitoring Agent may contend for resources with the :program:`mongod`.

You can install the Monitoring Agent on the same system as an
:term:`arbiter`, a :program:`mongos`, or an application server
depending on the requirements of these services and available
resources.

Can I run the Monitoring Agent on an AWS micro server?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you monitor five or fewer ``mongod`` instances, you can use
a AWS micro server.

Why can't the Monitoring Agent connect to my host?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The most common problem is that the agent is unable to resolve the
hostname of the server. Check DNS and the ``/etc/hosts`` file.

The second most common problem is that there are firewall rules in
place that prohibit access to the server from the agent.

To test the connection, login to the server running the agent and try
to connect using the ``mongo`` shell: 

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo hostname:port/test

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-port-forwarding-unsupported.rst

Why does the Monitoring Agent connect with hostnames instead of IP addresses?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, the Monitoring Agent tries to connect by resolving hostnames. If
the agent cannot connect by resolving a hostname, you can force the Monitoring
Agent to prefer an IP address over its corresponding hostname for a specific
IP address. Preferred hostnames also allow you to specify the hostname to use for
servers with multiple aliases. This prevents servers from appearing
multiple times under different names in the |mms| interface.

To create a preferred hostname, go to :doc:`Group Settings
</tutorial/manage-group-settings>` and add a :guilabel:`Preferred
Hostnames` entry. For details, see
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-group-settings`

How do I setup and configure the agent?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

See the ``README`` file included in the agent download.

How do I delete a Monitoring Agent from |mms|?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Monitoring Agents report their status to |mms|. When an agent does not
report for more than 24 hours, the agent no longer appears in |mms|.

For more details, see :doc:`/tutorial/delete-monitoring-agent`.
