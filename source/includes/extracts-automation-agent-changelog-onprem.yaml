   .. _automation-2.5.16.1552:

   Automation Agent ``2.5.16.1552``
   --------------------------------

   *Released with Ops Manager 2.0.2 on 2016-03-01*

   - Added support for managing MongoDB on SUSE12.

   - Stability and performance improvements for restores via automation.

   - Added optimization to prioritize replica set reconfiguration

     determining whether or not an index already exists.

   - Fixed issue with importing existing deployments that include
     arbiters running with authentication.

     sets to ensure a super majority is always up.

   - Fixed bug where failed Automation Agent automatic updates can cause
     surge in configuration calls from the Automation Agent.

   - Added support to change the storage engine for :term:`replica sets
     <replica set>` with more than one data node.
