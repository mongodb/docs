Overview
--------

{+framework-core+} allows you to work with data in your application without
explicitly running database commands. You can insert, update, or delete data
within your application and persist those changes to MongoDB by using the
``SaveChanges()`` method.

When you call the ``SaveChanges()`` method, the {+provider-short+} automatically detects
any changes made to your data and runs the necessary commands to update the
database by using the MongoDB Query API.

In this guide, you can see examples of how to perform common write operations on
an application configured to use the {+provider-short+}.

.. tip::

   To learn how to configure an application to use the {+provider-short+}, see
   :ref:`entity-framework-configure`.

Insert
------

You can use the ``Add()`` method to insert a single entity into your collection, 
or you can use the ``AddRange()`` method to insert multiple entities at once. 


.. _entity-framework-insert-one:

Insert One Entity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Add()`` method accepts a single entity of the same type that you
specified on the ``DbSet`` instance that you are modifying.

The following code uses the ``Add()`` method to add a new ``Planet`` object to
the ``DbSet`` called ``Planets``. It then calls the ``SaveChanges()`` method to
insert that entity into the MongoDB collection.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/quick-reference.cs
   :start-after: // start-insert-one
   :end-before: // end-insert-one
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:


.. _entity-framework-insert-multiple:

Insert Multiple Entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``AddRange()`` method accepts an array of entities that you want to add to the ``DbSet``. 

The following code uses the ``AddRange()`` method to add an array of ``Planet``
objects to the ``DbSet`` called ``Planets``. It then calls the ``SaveChanges()``
method to insert those entities into the MongoDB collection.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/quick-reference.cs
   :start-after: // start-insert-many
   :end-before: // end-insert-many
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

.. _entity-framework-update:

Update
------

To update an entity, first retrieve the entity that you want to update. Then
make the changes to that entity. The provider tracks any changes made to the entity, such as setting
properties or adding and removing items from fields with list values. To save the update to
MongoDB, call the ``SaveChanges()`` method. The {+provider-short+} compares the updated entity with a
snapshot of the entity before the change and automatically updates the collection
by using the MongoDB Query API.

The following code retrieves an entity in which the ``name`` value is
``"Mercury"``, then updates the ``name`` field. The code then calls the ``SaveChanges()``
method to persist that change to the collection.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/quick-reference.cs
   :start-after: // start-update-one
   :end-before: // end-update-one
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

Delete
------

You can use the ``Remove()`` method to delete a single entity from your
collection, or the ``RemoveRange()`` method to delete multiple entities at
once.

.. _entity-framework-delete-one:

Delete One Entity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Remove()`` method accepts a single entity of the same type that you
specified on the ``DbSet`` instance that you are modifying.

The following code removes a ``Planet`` entity in which the ``name`` value is
``"Pluto"``. It then calls the ``SaveChanges()`` method to delete that entity from
the MongoDB collection.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/quick-reference.cs
   :start-after: // start-delete-one
   :end-before: // end-delete-one
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

.. _entity-framework-delete-multiple:

Delete Multiple Entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``RemoveRange()`` method accepts an array of entities to remove from the
``DbSet``. 

The following code finds two ``Planet`` entities and adds them to an array. It
then uses the ``RemoveRange()`` method to remove both entities from the
``DbSet``. Finally, it uses the ``SaveChanges()`` method to remove those
entities from the MongoDB collection.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/quick-reference.cs
   :start-after: // start-delete-many
   :end-before: // end-delete-many
   :language: csharp
