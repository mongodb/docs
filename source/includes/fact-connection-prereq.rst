- TLS/SSL
   Clients must have support for TLS/SSL to connect to an |service|
   cluster.

- Whitelist
   To access a cluster, you must connect from an IP address on the
   |service| group's IP whitelist. If you need to add an IP address to the
   whitelist, you can do so in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog. You can
   also add the IP address from the :ref:`Security tab <add-to-whitelist>`.
