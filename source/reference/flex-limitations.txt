Operational Limits
------------------

The following table lists the operational limits of |service| {+Flex-clusters+}:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Operation
     - Limit

   * - :manual:`Aggregation </aggregation>` and :manual:`Queries </tutorial/query-documents/>`
     - {+Flex-clusters+} don't support the ``allowDiskUse`` option for the
       :manual:`aggregation command </reference/command/aggregate>`, 
       its :manual:`helper method </reference/method/db.collection.aggregate>`,
       or the :manual:`cursor.allowDiskUse() </reference/method/cursor.allowDiskUse#mongodb-method-cursor.allowDiskUse>`
       query cursor method.

       On {+Flex-clusters+}, aggregation pipelines don't support the 
       :pipeline:`$currentOp`, :pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`, 
       :pipeline:`$listSessions`, or :pipeline:`$planCacheStats` stages.

       {+Flex-clusters+} aggregation pipelines can have a maximum of 50 stages.

   * - |service| Alerts
     - {+Flex-clusters+} can only trigger alerts configured with one of the 
       following :doc:`alert conditions </reference/alert-conditions>`:

       - Connections
       - Logical Size
       - Network
       - Opscounter

   * - |service| Monitoring
     - The :guilabel:`Metrics` view of a {+Flex-cluster+} displays only the 
       following metrics:

       - Connections
       - Logical Size
       - Network
       - Opscounter

       To learn more, see :ref:`Real Time Metrics <real-time-metrics-status-tab>`.

   * - Authentication
     
     - {+Flex-clusters+} support the following authentication methods only:
      
       - Password (SCRAM-SHA1)
       - X.509 Certificates
       - AWS IAM

   * - Auto-Expand Storage
     - {+Flex-clusters+} don't provide 
       :ref:`automatically scaling storage <cluster-autoscaling>`.

   * - |bson| Nested Object Depth
     - {+Flex-clusters+} can store documents with a maximum of 50 nested levels.

   * - Build Index with Rolling Build
     - {+Flex-clusters+} don't support 
       :manual:`building indexes with a rolling build </tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets/>`.

   * - Change Streams Filtering
     - For {+Flex-clusters+}, you can use only strings and regular expressions 
       in filters on database names (namespace ``ns`` fields) in
       :manual:`change streams </changeStreams/>`. You can't use commands,
       such as ``$in``, in database namespace filters. This limit
       doesn't apply to filtering on collection names in change streams.

   * - Command Line Tools
     - For {+Flex-clusters+}, you can't run |mongorestore| or |mongodump| on 
       the ``admin`` database. If you use the ``--db`` option to set the 
       destination database to ``admin``, the program returns an error.
     
   * - Connections
     - {+Flex-clusters+} have a maximum of 500 connections.

   * - Cursors
     - {+Flex-clusters+} can't use the
       :manual:`noTimeout cursor option </reference/method/cursor.addOption/#flags>`.

   * - Custom Roles
     - Changes to :doc:`custom roles </security-add-mongodb-roles>`
       might take up to 30 seconds to deploy in {+Flex-clusters+}.

   * - Database and Collections
     - {+Flex-clusters+} have a maximum of 100 databases and a total of 500 
       collections.

   * - Access to Collections in ``local``, ``admin``, and ``config`` Databases
     - {+Flex-clusters+} don't allow:

       - Read access to any collection in the ``local`` database with
         the exception of read access to the oplog.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-regex-queries-shared-oplog.rst

       - Write access to any collection in the ``local`` and ``config`` 
         databases.

       - Read or write access to any collection in the ``admin`` 
         database.

       |service| issues an error similar to the following if you attempt
       to read or write to collections in these databases:

       .. code-block:: none
          :copyable: false

          command <cmd name> is not allowed in this Atlas tier
          (Unauthorized) not authorized on <db name> to execute command <cmd name>

   * - Database Logs
     - {+Flex-clusters+} don't allow you to download logs.

   * - Data Recovery
     - .. include:: //includes/fact-backup-shared-tier-limitations.rst

   * - Data Storage
     - {+Flex-clusters+} limit the maximum total data storage space to 5 GB.

       Data storage space includes the number of bytes of all
       uncompressed BSON documents stored in all collections, plus the
       bytes stored in their associated indexes.

   * - JavaScript
     - {+Flex-clusters+} don't support server-side JavaScript. For example,
       :manual:`$where </reference/operator/query/where>` and
       :manual:`map-reduce </core/map-reduce>` are unsupported.

   * - Namespaces and Database Names
     - {+Flex-cluster+} namespaces are limited to 95 bytes. Database names are 
       limited to 38 bytes.

   * - Performance Advisor
     - {+Flex-clusters+} don't provide access to the 
       :doc:`Performance Advisor </performance-advisor>`. 

   * - Query Utilization
     - The percentage of time that a query is running over any five
       minute period must remain under 100% on {+Flex-clusters+}.

   * - Real-Time Performance Panel
     - {+Flex-clusters+} don't provide access to the 
       :doc:`Real-Time Performance Panel </real-time-performance-panel>`.

   * - Sort in Memory
     - {+Flex-clusters+} limits sort in-memory to 32 MB.

   * - Throughput
     - {+Flex-clusters+} limit the number of read and write operations to 500 
       operations per second.

       |service| handles {+clusters+} that exceed the operations per second
       rate limit as follows:

       - |service| triggers a sub-second cooldown period before resuming
         the cluster's operations on a given connection. If the queue is
         greater than the operations per second limit, operations might
         wait for more than a second in the queue.
       - If the number of operations per second drops below the rate limit
         threshold, |service| resumes processing of the queued operations
         on each connection before processing any new operations on that
         connection.
