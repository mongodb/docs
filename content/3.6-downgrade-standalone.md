# Downgrade 3.6 Standalone to 3.4

Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
of this document.


## Downgrade Path

Once upgraded to 3.6, we recommend downgrading to the latest patch release of 3.4.


## Create Backup

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.


## Prerequisites

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the feature
compatibility version and remove any 3.6 features
[incompatible](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#compatibility-enabled) with 3.4
versions as outlined below. These steps are necessary only if
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has ever been set to ``"3.6"``.

### 1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version

1. Connect a [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell to the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance. 

2. Downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` to ``"3.4"``. 

   ```javascript

   db.adminCommand({setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4"})

   ```

   The [``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/#dbcmd.setFeatureCompatibilityVersion) command performs writes
   to an internal system collection and is idempotent. If for any reason
   the command does not complete successfully, retry the command on the
   [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance.


### 2. Remove Backwards Incompatible Persisted Features

Remove all persisted features that are [incompatible](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-compatibility/#compatibility-enabled) with 3.4. For example, if you have defined
any any view definitions, document validators, and partial index
filters that use 3.6 query features such as [``$jsonSchema``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/jsonSchema/#op._S_jsonSchema) or
[``$expr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/expr/#op._S_expr), you must remove them.


## Procedure


### Step 1: Download the latest 3.4 binaries.

Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the latest
release in the 3.4 series. If using a package manager, add a new
repository for the 3.4 binaries, then perform the actual downgrade
process.

Once upgraded to 3.6, we recommend downgrading to the latest patch release of 3.4.


### Step 2: Restart with the latest 3.4 ``mongod`` instance.

Shut down your [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance. Replace the existing
binary with the downloaded [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary and restart.
