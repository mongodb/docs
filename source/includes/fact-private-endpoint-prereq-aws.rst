- Configure the private endpoint in the same region as the |service|
  {+cluster+} that you want to connect to.

- Have either the :authrole:`Project Owner` or
  :authrole:`Organization Owner` role in |service|.

- Have an |aws| user account with an |iam| user policy that
  grants permissions to create, modify, describe, and delete
  endpoints. For more information on controlling the use of
  interface endpoints, see the :aws:`AWS Documentation 
  </vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html>`.

- **(Recommended)**:
  :aws:`Install the AWS CLI 
  </cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html>`.

- If you have not already done so, create your |vpc| and EC2
  instances in |aws|. See the :aws:`AWS documentation
  </index.html>` for guidance.
