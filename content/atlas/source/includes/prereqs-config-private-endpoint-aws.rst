1. Have an |aws| user account with an |iam| user policy that grants
   permissions to create, modify, describe, and delete endpoints. To
   learn more about controlling the use of interface endpoints, see
   the :aws:`AWS Documentation
   </vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html>`.

#. :aws:`Install the AWS CLI
   </cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html>`.

#. If you have not already done so, create your |vpc| and EC2 instances
   in |aws|. To learn more, see the :aws:`AWS documentation
   </index.html>` for guidance.
