====================================
SSL Encryption for Agent Connections
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|MMS| supports SSL for encrypting the following connections made by
Monitoring Agents and Backup Agents:

- Connections between the agents and MongoDB instances.

- Connections between the agents and |MMS| servers.

Connections between Agents and MongoDB Instances
------------------------------------------------

If your MongoDB deployment uses SSL, then you must configure the
Monitoring and Backup agents to use SSL to connect to the deployment's
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances. Use the following
procedures:

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-for-monitoring`

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-for-backup`

Connections between Agents and MMS Servers
------------------------------------------

.. only:: saas

   The Monitoring and Backup Agents always use SSL when connecting to the
   |MMS| servers.

.. only:: hosted

   To ensure that the Monitoring and Backup Agents use SSL when connecting
   to the |MMS| servers, use an HTTPS proxy in front of |MMS|.

   You can optionally configure a Jetty instance to use HTTPS for
   connections between the |mms| application and agents. To do so, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-jetty-https`.

For the certificate settings used by the Monitoring Agent, see
:ref:`server-monitoring-ssl`.

For the certificate settings used by the Backup Agent, see
:ref:`backup-mongodb-ssl-settings`.
