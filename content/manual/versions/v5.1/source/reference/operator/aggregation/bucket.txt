.. pipeline:: $bucket
   
   .. versionadded:: 3.4

   Categorizes incoming documents into groups, called buckets, based on
   a specified expression and bucket boundaries and outputs a document
   per each bucket. Each output document contains an ``_id`` field whose
   value specifies the inclusive lower bound of the bucket. The
   :ref:`output <bucket-output>` option specifies the fields included in
   each output document.
   
   :pipeline:`$bucket` only produces output documents for buckets that
   contain at least one input document.

Considerations
--------------

.. _bucket-memory-limit:

``$bucket`` and Memory Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$bucket` stage has a limit of 100 megabytes of RAM. By
default, if the stage exceeds this limit, :pipeline:`$bucket` returns an
error. To allow more space for stage processing, use the
:ref:`allowDiskUse <aggregate-cmd-allowDiskUse>` option to enable
aggregation pipeline stages to write data to temporary files.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline-limits`

Syntax
------

.. code-block:: javascript

   { 
     $bucket: {
         groupBy: <expression>,
         boundaries: [ <lowerbound1>, <lowerbound2>, ... ],
         default: <literal>,
         output: {
            <output1>: { <$accumulator expression> },
            ...
            <outputN>: { <$accumulator expression> }
         }
      }
   }

The :pipeline:`$bucket` document contains the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field

     - Type

     - Description

   * - :ref:`groupBy <bucket-group-by>`

     - expression

     - .. _bucket-group-by:
     
       An :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` to group
       documents by. To specify a :ref:`field path
       <agg-quick-ref-field-paths>`, prefix the field name with a
       dollar sign ``$`` and enclose it in quotes.
       
       Unless :pipeline:`$bucket` includes a :ref:`default
       <bucket-default>` specification, each input document must
       resolve the ``groupBy`` field path or expression to a value
       that falls within one of the ranges specified by the
       :ref:`boundaries <bucket-boundaries>`.

   * - :ref:`boundaries <bucket-boundaries>`

     - array

     - .. _bucket-boundaries:
     
       An array of values based on the :ref:`groupBy
       <bucket-group-by>` expression that specify the boundaries for
       each bucket. Each adjacent pair of values acts as the
       inclusive lower boundary and the exclusive upper boundary for
       the bucket. You must specify at least two boundaries.
       
       The specified values must be in ascending order and all of the
       same :doc:`type </reference/bson-types>`. The exception is if
       the values are of mixed numeric types, such as:
       
       ``[ 10, NumberLong(20), NumberInt(30) ]``
       
       .. example::
       
          An array of ``[ 0, 5, 10 ]`` creates two buckets:
       
          - [0, 5) with inclusive lower bound ``0`` and exclusive
            upper bound ``5``.
       
          - [5, 10) with inclusive lower bound ``5`` and exclusive
            upper bound ``10``.
       
   * - :ref:`default <bucket-default>`

     - literal

     - .. _bucket-default:
     
       Optional. A literal that specifies the ``_id`` of an
       additional bucket that contains all documents whose
       :ref:`groupBy <bucket-group-by>` expression result does not fall into a bucket
       specified by :ref:`boundaries <bucket-boundaries>`.
       
       If unspecified, each input document must resolve the
       ``groupBy`` expression to a value within one of the bucket
       ranges specified by ``boundaries`` or the operation throws an
       error.
       
       The ``default`` value must be less than the lowest
       ``boundaries`` value, or greater than or equal to the highest
       ``boundaries`` value.
       
       The ``default`` value can be of a different
       :doc:`type </reference/bson-types>` than the entries in
       ``boundaries``.

   * - :ref:`output <bucket-output>`

     - document

     - .. _bucket-output:
     
       Optional. A document that specifies the fields to include in
       the output documents in addition to the ``_id`` field. To
       specify the field to include, you must use :ref:`accumulator
       expressions <agg-quick-reference-accumulators>`.
       
       .. code-block:: javascript
       
          <outputfield1>: { <accumulator>: <expression1> },
          ...
          <outputfieldN>: { <accumulator>: <expressionN> }

       If you do not specify an ``output`` document, the operation
       returns a ``count`` field containing the number of documents
       in each bucket.

       If you specify an ``output`` document, only the fields
       specified in the document are returned; i.e. the ``count``
       field is not returned unless it is explicitly included in the
       ``output`` document.

Behavior
--------

:pipeline:`$bucket` requires at least one of the following conditions to be met
or the operation throws an error:

- Each input document resolves the :ref:`groupBy <bucket-group-by>`
  expression to a value within one of the bucket ranges specified by
  :ref:`boundaries <bucket-boundaries>`, or
   
- A :ref:`default <bucket-default>` value is specified to bucket
  documents whose ``groupBy``
  values are outside of the ``boundaries`` or of a different
  :doc:`BSON type </reference/bson-types>` than the values in
  ``boundaries``.

If the ``groupBy`` expression resolves to an array or a document,
``$bucket`` arranges the input documents into buckets using the
comparison logic from :pipeline:`$sort`.

Examples
--------

Bucket by Year and Filter by Bucket Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, create a sample collection named
``artists`` with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.artists.insertMany([
     { "_id" : 1, "last_name" : "Bernard", "first_name" : "Emil", "year_born" : 1868, "year_died" : 1941, "nationality" : "France" },
     { "_id" : 2, "last_name" : "Rippl-Ronai", "first_name" : "Joszef", "year_born" : 1861, "year_died" : 1927, "nationality" : "Hungary" },
     { "_id" : 3, "last_name" : "Ostroumova", "first_name" : "Anna", "year_born" : 1871, "year_died" : 1955, "nationality" : "Russia" },
     { "_id" : 4, "last_name" : "Van Gogh", "first_name" : "Vincent", "year_born" : 1853, "year_died" : 1890, "nationality" : "Holland" },
     { "_id" : 5, "last_name" : "Maurer", "first_name" : "Alfred", "year_born" : 1868, "year_died" : 1932, "nationality" : "USA" },
     { "_id" : 6, "last_name" : "Munch", "first_name" : "Edvard", "year_born" : 1863, "year_died" : 1944, "nationality" : "Norway" },
     { "_id" : 7, "last_name" : "Redon", "first_name" : "Odilon", "year_born" : 1840, "year_died" : 1916, "nationality" : "France" },
     { "_id" : 8, "last_name" : "Diriks", "first_name" : "Edvard", "year_born" : 1855, "year_died" : 1930, "nationality" : "Norway" }
   ])

The following operation groups the documents into buckets
according to the ``year_born`` field and filters based on the count
of documents in the buckets:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.artists.aggregate( [
     // First Stage
     {
       $bucket: { 
         groupBy: "$year_born",                        // Field to group by
         boundaries: [ 1840, 1850, 1860, 1870, 1880 ], // Boundaries for the buckets
         default: "Other",                             // Bucket id for documents which do not fall into a bucket
         output: {                                     // Output for each bucket
           "count": { $sum: 1 },
           "artists" : 
             { 
               $push: { 
                 "name": { $concat: [ "$first_name", " ", "$last_name"] }, 
                 "year_born": "$year_born"
               } 
             }
         }
       }
     },
     // Second Stage
     {
       $match: { count: {$gt: 3} }
     }
   ] )

First Stage
  The :pipeline:`$bucket` stage groups the documents into buckets by the
  ``year_born`` field. The buckets have the following :ref:`boundaries
  <bucket-boundaries>`:

  - [1840, 1850) with inclusive lowerbound ``1840`` and exclusive upper bound 
    ``1850``.  
  - [1850, 1860) with inclusive lowerbound ``1850`` and exclusive upper
    bound ``1860``. 
  - [1860, 1870) with inclusive lowerbound ``1860`` and exclusive upper bound 
    ``1870``.  
  - [1870, 1880) with inclusive lowerbound ``1870`` and exclusive upper
    bound ``1880``. 
  - If a document did not contain the ``year_born`` field or its
    ``year_born`` field was outside the ranges above, it would be placed
    in the :ref:`default <bucket-default>` bucket with the ``_id`` value
    ``"Other"``.

  The stage includes the :ref:`output <bucket-output>` document to
  determine the fields to return:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 60

     * - Field
       - Description

     * - ``_id``
       - Inclusive lower bound of the bucket.

     * - ``count``
       - Count of documents in the bucket.

     * - ``artists``
       - Array of documents containing information on each artist in the
         bucket. Each document contains the artist's

         - ``name``, which is a concatenation (i.e.
           :expression:`$concat`) of the artist's ``first_name`` and
           ``last_name``.

         - ``year_born``

  This stage passes the following documents to the next stage:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :copyable: false

     { "_id" : 1840, "count" : 1, "artists" : [ { "name" : "Odilon Redon", "year_born" : 1840 } ] }

     { "_id" : 1850, "count" : 2, "artists" : [ { "name" : "Vincent Van Gogh", "year_born" : 1853 }, 
                                                { "name" : "Edvard Diriks", "year_born" : 1855 } ] }

     { "_id" : 1860, "count" : 4, "artists" : [ { "name" : "Emil Bernard", "year_born" : 1868 }, 
                                                { "name" : "Joszef Rippl-Ronai", "year_born" : 1861 }, 
                                                { "name" : "Alfred Maurer", "year_born" : 1868 }, 
                                                { "name" : "Edvard Munch", "year_born" : 1863 } ] }

     { "_id" : 1870, "count" : 1, "artists" : [ { "name" : "Anna Ostroumova", "year_born" : 1871 } ] }
  
Second Stage
  The :pipeline:`$match` stage filters the output from the previous 
  stage to only return buckets which contain more than 3 documents.

  The operation returns the following document:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :copyable: false

     
     { "_id" : 1860, "count" : 4, "artists" :
       [ 
         { "name" : "Emil Bernard", "year_born" : 1868 }, 
         { "name" : "Joszef Rippl-Ronai", "year_born" : 1861 }, 
         { "name" : "Alfred Maurer", "year_born" : 1868 }, 
         { "name" : "Edvard Munch", "year_born" : 1863 } 
       ]
     }

Use $bucket with $facet to Bucket by Multiple Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :pipeline:`$facet` stage to perform multiple
:pipeline:`$bucket` aggregations in a single stage.

In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, create a sample collection named
``artwork`` with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.artwork.insertMany([
     { "_id" : 1, "title" : "The Pillars of Society", "artist" : "Grosz", "year" : 1926,
         "price" : NumberDecimal("199.99") },
     { "_id" : 2, "title" : "Melancholy III", "artist" : "Munch", "year" : 1902,
         "price" : NumberDecimal("280.00") },
     { "_id" : 3, "title" : "Dancer", "artist" : "Miro", "year" : 1925,
         "price" : NumberDecimal("76.04") },
     { "_id" : 4, "title" : "The Great Wave off Kanagawa", "artist" : "Hokusai",
         "price" : NumberDecimal("167.30") },
     { "_id" : 5, "title" : "The Persistence of Memory", "artist" : "Dali", "year" : 1931,
         "price" : NumberDecimal("483.00") },
     { "_id" : 6, "title" : "Composition VII", "artist" : "Kandinsky", "year" : 1913,
         "price" : NumberDecimal("385.00") },
     { "_id" : 7, "title" : "The Scream", "artist" : "Munch", "year" : 1893
         /* No price*/ },
     { "_id" : 8, "title" : "Blue Flower", "artist" : "O'Keefe", "year" : 1918,
         "price" : NumberDecimal("118.42") }
   ])

The following operation uses two :pipeline:`$bucket` stages within a
:pipeline:`$facet` stage to create two groupings, one by ``price`` and
the other by ``year``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.artwork.aggregate( [
     {
       $facet: {                               // Top-level $facet stage
         "price": [                            // Output field 1
           {
             $bucket: { 
                 groupBy: "$price",            // Field to group by
                 boundaries: [ 0, 200, 400 ],  // Boundaries for the buckets
                 default: "Other",             // Bucket id for documents which do not fall into a bucket
                 output: {                     // Output for each bucket 
                   "count": { $sum: 1 },
                   "artwork" : { $push: { "title": "$title", "price": "$price" } },
                   "averagePrice": { $avg: "$price" }
                 }
             }
           }
         ],
         "year": [                                      // Output field 2
           { 
             $bucket: {
               groupBy: "$year",                        // Field to group by
               boundaries: [ 1890, 1910, 1920, 1940 ],  // Boundaries for the buckets
               default: "Unknown",                      // Bucket id for documents which do not fall into a bucket
               output: {                                // Output for each bucket
                 "count": { $sum: 1 },
                 "artwork": { $push: { "title": "$title", "year": "$year" } }
               }
             }
           }
         ]
       }
     }
   ] )

First Facet
  The first facet groups the input documents by ``price``. The
  buckets have the following boundaries:

  - [0, 200) with inclusive lowerbound ``0`` and exclusive upper bound 
    ``200``.  
  - [200, 400) with inclusive lowerbound ``200`` and exclusive upper
    bound ``400``. 
  - "Other", the ``default`` bucket containing documents without prices or
    prices outside the ranges above.

  The :pipeline:`$bucket` stage includes the :ref:`output
  <bucket-output>` document to determine the fields to return:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 60

     * - Field
       - Description

     * - ``_id``
       - Inclusive lower bound of the bucket.

     * - ``count``
       - Count of documents in the bucket.

     * - ``artwork``
       - Array of documents containing information on each artwork
         in the bucket.

     * - ``averagePrice``
       - Employs the :group:`$avg` operator to display the average price
         of all artwork in the bucket. 

Second Facet
  The second facet groups the input documents by ``year``. The buckets
  have the following boundaries:

  - [1890, 1910) with inclusive lowerbound ``1890`` and exclusive upper
    bound ``1910``.
  - [1910, 1920) with inclusive lowerbound ``1910`` and exclusive upper
    bound ``1920``.
  - [1920, 1940) with inclusive lowerbound ``1910`` and exclusive upper
    bound ``1940``.
  - "Unknown", the ``default`` bucket containing documents without
    years or years outside the ranges above.

  The :pipeline:`$bucket` stage includes the :ref:`output
  <bucket-output>` document to determine the fields to return:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 60

     * - Field
       - Description

     * - ``count``
       - Count of documents in the bucket.

     * - ``artwork``
       - Array of documents containing information on each artwork
         in the bucket.

Output
  The operation returns the following document:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     
     {
       "price" : [ // Output of first facet
         {
           "_id" : 0,

             { "title" : "The Great Wave off Kanagawa", "price" : NumberDecimal("167.30") },
             { "title" : "Blue Flower", "price" : NumberDecimal("118.42") }
           ],
           "averagePrice" : NumberDecimal("140.4375")
         },
         {
           "_id" : 200,
           "count" : 2,

             { "title" : "Composition VII", "price" : NumberDecimal("385.00") }
           ],
           "averagePrice" : NumberDecimal("332.50")
         },
         {
           // Includes documents without prices and prices greater than 400

             { "title" : "The Scream" }
           ],
           "averagePrice" : NumberDecimal("483.00")
         }
       ],
       "year" : [ // Output of second facet

           ]
         },
