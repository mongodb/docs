Create an Alert Configuration
=============================

Overview
--------

An alert configuration defines the conditions that trigger an alert and
defines the notifications to be sent.

You can :ref:`create an alert configuration from scratch
<create-new-alert-configuration>` or :ref:`clone it from an existing
alert <clone-alert-configuration>`.

.. I've edited the above to distinguish between alerts and alert
   configurations, per Mike Benoit's comments on pull 249 for ticket 2498.

Considerations
++++++++++++++

Costs
~~~~~

Costs to send alerts depend on your telephone service contract. Many
factors may affect alert delivery, including do not call lists, caps
for messages sent or delivered, delivery time of day, and message
caching.

Alert Intervals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To implement alert escalation, you can create multiple alert
configurations with different minimum frequencies. |mms| processes alerts
on a 5-minute interval. Therefore, the minimum frequency for an alert
is 5 minutes. The time between re-notifications increases by the
frequency amount every alert cycle (e.g. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15
minutes, 20 minutes, etc.) up to a maximum of 24 hours. The default
frequency for a new alert configuration is 60 minutes.

When an alert state triggers, you can set a time to elapse before MMS
will send alert messages at the specified interval. This helps
eliminate false positives. Type in the :guilabel:`after waiting` field
the number of minutes to wait before sending the alert at the specified
interval for each recipient.

.. START-COMMENT

   - If you select **Group** and check the **SMS** box, then |mms| sends
     alert text messages to all users in the group who have filled
     in their Mobile Number in the Settings page.

   - If you select **User** and check the **SMS** box, then |mms| sends
     alert text messages to the user's Mobile Number specified in
     their Settings page.

   - |mms| sends alert emails as multipart messages containing both HTML
     and plain text content. This way, the recipient's email client
     can choose the appropriate message format for display.
