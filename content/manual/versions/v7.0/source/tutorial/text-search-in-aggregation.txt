.. _text-agg-expression-behavior:

In the aggregation pipeline, text search is available via the use of
the :query:`$text` query operator in the :pipeline:`$match` stage.

Restrictions
------------

For general ``$text`` operator restrictions, see :ref:`operator
restrictions <text-query-operator-behavior>`.

In addition, text search in the aggregation pipeline has the following
restrictions:

.. include:: /includes/list-text-search-restrictions-in-agg.rst

.. Since $geoNear needs to be the first stage in pipeline,
   not documenting that you cannot include the
   $text operation + some other operation that requires a special index.
   Although, if either of the two no longer needs to be the first
   stage, then will need to include.

Text Score
----------

.. include:: /includes/fact-text-search-score.rst

The metadata is only available after the :pipeline:`$match` stage that
includes the ``$text`` operation.

.. _text-search-examples:

Examples
--------

The following examples assume a collection ``articles`` that has a text
index on the field ``subject``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.createIndex( { subject: "text" } )

Calculate the Total Views for Articles that Contains a Word
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following aggregation searches for the term ``cake`` in the
:pipeline:`$match` stage and calculates the total ``views`` for the
matching documents in the :pipeline:`$group` stage.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.aggregate(
      [
        { $match: { $text: { $search: "cake" } } },
        { $group: { _id: null, views: { $sum: "$views" } } }
      ]
   )

Return Results Sorted by Text Search Score
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To sort by the text search score, include a :expression:`{$meta:
"textScore"} <$meta>` expression in the :pipeline:`$sort` stage. The
following example matches on *either* the term ``cake`` or ``tea``,
sorts by the ``textScore`` in descending order, and returns only the
``title`` field in the results set.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.aggregate(
      [
        { $match: { $text: { $search: "cake tea" } } },
        { $sort: { score: { $meta: "textScore" } } },
        { $project: { title: 1, _id: 0 } }
      ]
   )

The specified metadata determines the sort order. For example, the
``"textScore"`` metadata sorts in descending order. See
:expression:`$meta` for more information on metadata as well as an
example of overriding the default sort order of the metadata.

Match on Text Score
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``"textScore"`` metadata is available for projections, sorts, and
conditions subsequent the :pipeline:`$match` stage that includes the
``$text`` operation.

The following example matches on *either* the term ``cake`` or ``tea``,
projects the ``title`` and the ``score`` fields, and then returns only
those documents with a ``score`` greater than ``1.0``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.aggregate(
      [
        { $match: { $text: { $search: "cake tea" } } },
        { $project: { title: 1, _id: 0, score: { $meta: "textScore" } } },
        { $match: { score: { $gt: 1.0 } } }
      ]
   )

Specify a Language for Text Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following aggregation searches in spanish for documents that
contain the term ``saber`` but not the term ``claro`` in the
:pipeline:`$match` stage and calculates the total ``views`` for the
matching documents in the :pipeline:`$group` stage.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.aggregate(
      [
        { $match: { $text: { $search: "saber -claro", $language: "es" } } },
        { $group: { _id: null, views: { $sum: "$views" } } }
      ]
   )
