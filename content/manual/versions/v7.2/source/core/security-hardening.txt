To reduce the risk exposure of the entire MongoDB system, ensure that
only trusted hosts have access to MongoDB.

MongoDB Configuration Hardening
-------------------------------

IP Binding
~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-default-bind-ip-change.rst

.. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

.. warning::

   Make sure that your :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   instances are only accessible on trusted networks. If your system
   has more than one network interface, bind MongoDB programs to the
   private or internal network interface.

For more information, see :doc:`/core/security-mongodb-configuration`.

HTTP Status Interface and REST API

Network Hardening
-----------------

.. _security-firewalls:

Firewalls
~~~~~~~~~

Firewalls allow administrators to filter and control access to a system
by providing granular control over network communications. For
administrators of MongoDB, the following capabilities are important:
limiting incoming traffic on a specific port to specific systems and
limiting incoming traffic from untrusted hosts.

On Linux systems, the ``iptables`` interface provides access to the
underlying ``netfilter`` firewall. On Windows systems, ``netsh``
command line interface provides access to the underlying Windows
Firewall. For additional information about firewall configuration, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-linux-iptables-firewall` and

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-windows-netsh-firewall`.

For best results and to minimize overall exposure, ensure that *only*
traffic from trusted sources can reach :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances and that the :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances can only connect to trusted outputs.


Virtual Private Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtual private networks, or VPNs, make it possible to link two
networks over an encrypted and limited-access trusted
network. Typically, MongoDB users who use VPNs use TLS/SSL rather than
IPSEC VPNs for performance issues.

Depending on configuration and implementation, VPNs provide for
certificate validation and a choice of encryption protocols, which
requires a rigorous level of authentication and identification of all
clients. Furthermore, because VPNs provide a secure tunnel, by using a
VPN connection to control access to your MongoDB instance, you can
prevent tampering and "man-in-the-middle" attacks.

Disable IP Forwarding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IP forwarding allows servers to forward packets to other systems.  Disable this
feature on servers that host :program:`mongod`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Linux
      :tabid: linux

      To disable IP forwarding on Linux, use the ``sysctl`` command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0

      To make the change persistent, edit the ``/etc/sysctl.conf`` file to add
      this line:

      .. code-block:: conf

         net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

   .. tab:: Windows
      :tabid: windows

      IP forwarding is disabled by default on Windows.
