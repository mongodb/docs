Overview
--------

|fts| allows you to sort the results in ascending or descending order on 
fields that you define in your |fts| index. You can sort by the
following field types using the ``sort`` option: 

- ``boolean``
- ``date``
- ``number`` (integer, float, and double values)
- ``objectId``
- ``uuid`` 
- ``string`` (indexed as the :ref:`token <bson-data-types-token>` type) 

You can also sort by the score of the documents in the results and by
:ref:`null values <fts-sort-null>`.

.. _sort-compatibility-ref:

``sort`` Option Compatibility 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| supports both non-sharded and sharded sort queries on
all major and minor releases for MongoDB 7.0 and later versions.

.. _sort-option-limitations:

``sort`` Option Limitations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can't sort on fields of :ref:`embeddedDocuments
  <bson-data-types-embedded-documents>` type.
- You can't use the ``sort`` option with the deprecated
  :ref:`knnBeta <knn-beta-ref>`
  operator.

.. _fts-sort-usage:

Usage 
~~~~~

To sort your |fts| results, you must do the following:

1. Create a |fts| index on the fields to sort the results by. 

   To sort on ``boolean``, ``date``, ``number``, ``UUID``, and
   ``objectId`` fields, use dynamic or static mappings. To sort on
   string fields, you must use :ref:`static mappings
   <static-dynamic-mappings>` to index the field as the ``token`` type. 

#. Create and run your query with the ``sort`` option against the fields
   you defined in the index for sorting. To learn more, see 
   :ref:`sort-syntax-ref`.

.. _fts-sort-behavior:

Behavior 
~~~~~~~~

Sort by Boolean, Date, Numeric, UUID, ObjectId, or String Field 
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The ``sort`` option takes a document that specifies the fields to sort 
by and the respective sort order. |fts| follows the :manual:`MongoDB
comparison order </reference/bson-type-comparison-order/>` for the
supported data types. It treats UUID values like ``BinData``. To learn
more, see :manual:`non-existent fields 
</reference/bson-type-comparison-order/#non-existent-fields>`. 

You can specify the following sort order to sort your results by: 

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 10 90 

   * - ``1`` 
     - Sort in ascending order. 
  
       When you sort in ascending order, |fts| returns documents with
       missing values before documents with values. 

   * - ``-1`` 
     - Sort in descending order.

.. _fts-sort-score-unique-field:

Sort by Score And a Unique Field 
````````````````````````````````

You can also sort by score in ascending or descending order. The
``sort`` option takes a document that specifies the :manual:`$meta
</reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` expression, which requires the
``searchScore`` value. 

.. example:: 

   Suppose your application allows users to skip to the last page of the
   search results. The following example sorts the results by score in
   ascending order so that the document with the lowest score displays at
   the top of the results: 

   .. code-block:: json 
      :copyable: true 

      sort: {score: {$meta: "searchScore", order: 1}}

You can use ``sort`` to also ensure that the results have a determined
order when multiple documents in the results have identical scores. For
example, if you sort the results by a unique field, such as a date field
named ``lastUpdated`` as shown in the following example, |fts| returns
results with identical scores in a determined order: 

.. example::

   .. code-block:: 
      :copyable: false

      sort: {score: {$meta: "searchScore"}, lastUpdated: 1}

However, if you don't specify a unique field to sort the results by,
|fts| returns the results sorted by score in descending order. |fts|
returns results with identical scores or values in an arbitrary order.
The following example doesn't sort the results by a unique field.   

.. example:: 

   .. code-block:: shell 
      :copyable: false 

      sort: {score: {$meta: "searchScore"}}

To learn more, see :ref:`scoring-ref`.

.. _fts-sort-arrays:

Sort Arrays 
```````````

|fts| flattens the arrays for sorting. 

.. example:: 

   Consider the following array: 

   .. code-block:: shell 
      :copyable: false 

      [4, [1, [8,5], 9], 2]

   |fts| flattens the preceding array similar to the following:

   .. code-block:: shell 
      :copyable: false 

      4, 1, 8, 5, 9, 2

   For an ascending sort, |fts| uses ``1`` to compare the array to other
   values. For a descending sort, |fts| uses ``9`` to compare the array
   to other values.

When comparing with elements inside an array:

- For an ascending sort, |fts| compares the smallest elements of the
  array or performs a less than (``<``) comparison. 

  .. example:: 

     |fts| sorts results in the following order if you sort by numbers
     in ascending order:

     .. code-block:: shell 
        :copyable: false 

        -20
        [-3, 12] // <- -3 comes before 5.
        5
        [6, 18]  // <- 6 comes after 5.
        13
        14

- For a descending sort, |fts| compares the largest elements of the
  array or performs a greater than (``>``) comparison. 

  .. example:: 

     |fts| sorts results in the following order if you sort by numbers
     in descending order:

     .. code-block:: shell 
        :copyable: false 

        [6, 18]  // <- 18 comes before 14.
        14
        13
        [-3, 12] // <- 12 comes after 13.
        5
        -20

.. _fts-sort-arrays-multiple-types:

Sort Arrays with Multiple Types
```````````````````````````````

When sorting over array fields that contain values of multiple 
|bson| types, |fts| selects a representative element from the array 
to use for comparison according to the :manual:`MongoDB comparison and sort order
</reference/bson-type-comparison-order/>` by default.

- For an ascending sort, |fts| uses the element with the 
  lowest |bson| type.

- For a descending sort, |fts| uses the element with the
  highest |bson| type.

If there are multiple values of the same |bson| type
in the array, standard sort behavior for the selected 
type applies.

.. example:: 

   Consider the following array: 

   .. code-block:: shell 
      :copyable: false 

      [ 'foo', null, 15, true, false ]

   - For an ascending sort, |fts| uses ``null``, as it 
     is the lowest :ref:`supported <bson-data-types>` |bson| type. 

   - For a descending sort, |fts| uses ``true``, as it 
     is the highest |bson| type in the array and |fts| ranks ``true`` 
     values above ``false`` values. 

   However, if you set ``noData: highest`` in your 
   ``sort`` :ref:`syntax <sort-syntax-ref>`, |fts| considers 
   null and missing values as the highest |bson| type.
   For the example array, the following behavior applies:

   - For an ascending sort, |fts| uses ``15``, as
     it is now the lowest |bson| type in the array.
   - For a descending sort, |fts| uses ``null``, as it 
     is now the highest |bson| type in the array.
 
   To learn more, see :ref:`fts-sort-null`.

For an example, see :ref:`fts-sort-eg-null-multiple-types`.

.. _fts-sort-null:

Sort by Null and Missing Values 
```````````````````````````````

|fts| treats null values as equal to missing and empty values, and the
order of documents with these values is non-deterministic when sorting.

By default, |fts| follows the :manual:`MongoDB comparison and sort order
</reference/bson-type-comparison-order/>` and considers null values 
as lower than all other :ref:`supported <bson-data-types>` |bson| types. 
Therefore, null values appear at the top of the results during 
an ascending sort and at the bottom during a descending sort.

To configure where null values appear in the results, specify the ``noData``
field in your ``sort`` :ref:`syntax <sort-syntax-ref>`. The ``noData`` 
field takes the following values:

- ``lowest`` (default): Sets null values as the lowest |bson| type during sorting.
  Sorts null values at the top of the results during an
  ascending sort and at the bottom during a descending sort.
- ``highest``: Sets null values as the highest |bson| type during sorting.
  Sorts null values at the bottom of the results during an
  ascending sort and at the top during a descending sort.

.. note::
    
   The same behavior applies when sorting on
   :ref:`arrays with multiple types <fts-sort-arrays-multiple-types>`
   that contain null or missing values.

For examples, see :ref:`fts-sort-eg-null` and 
:ref:`fts-sort-eg-null-multiple-types`.

.. _fts-sort-embedded-documents:

Sort on Embedded Documents Array Fields 
```````````````````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/fts/facts/fact-fts-embedded-documents-sort.rst

.. _sort-considerations:

Considerations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consistency 
```````````

|fts| indexes are eventually :ref:`consistent
<index-eventual-consistency-and-latency>`, and values returned in
results might be different from values used in sorting.

Performance 
```````````

This feature optimizes queries that use :pipeline:`$search` with
:pipeline:`$limit` as a subsequent stage. If |fts| needs to sort all 
documents in the collection, the response might be slow.

Scoring 
```````

|fts| returns :ref:`scores <scoring-ref>` for all documents in the
results. However, you might see higher scoring documents after lower
scoring documents because the order of documents in the results is based
on the sort criteria unless you explicitly sort by score.

.. _sort-syntax-ref:

Syntax 
------

``sort`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 7-11
   :linenos:

   {
     "$search": {  
       "index": "<index name>", // optional, defaults to "default"
       "<operator>": { // such as "text", "compound", or "phrase"
         <operator-specification>
       },
       "sort": { 
         score: {$meta: "searchScore"}, // optional field
         "<field-to-sort>": <sort-order>, // 1 or -1, or a document
         ...
       }
     }
   }

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Parameter
     - Description

   * - ``score``
     - Optional. Determines whether to sort by the search score.
       To learn more, see :ref:`fts-sort-score-unique-field`.

   * - ``<field-to-sort>``
     - Required. The name of the field to sort by.

   * - ``<sort-order>``
     - Required. Determines the sort order. 
       Use ``1`` for ascending order and ``-1`` for
       descending order. 
       
       If you want to specify the 
       :ref:`noData <fts-sort-null>` field, use a document 
       with the following syntax:

       .. code-block:: json

          "<field-to-sort>": {
            order: 1 | -1, // required field
            noData: "lowest" | "highest" // optional field
          },
          ...

.. _fts-sort-index:

Index Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example queries in this page use either the ``sample_mflix.movies``,
the ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReview``, or a custom collection. If you
create the following indexes on these collections, you can run the
sample queries against the indexed fields.

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: ``movies`` Collection
      :tabid: movies

      The index definition for the ``movies`` collection specifies the
      following:  

      - Index ``awards.wins`` field as: 

        - ``number`` type for sorting and querying, including running
          :ref:`fts-facet-ref` queries 

      - Index ``released`` field as: 

        - ``date`` type for sorting and querying, including running
          :ref:`fts-facet-ref` queries 

      - Index ``title`` field as: 

        - ``token`` type for sorting 
        - ``string`` type for querying  

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: true 
         :linenos:

         {
           "mappings": {
             "dynamic": true,
             "fields": {
               "awards": {
                 "dynamic": false,
                 "fields": {
                   "wins": [
                     {
                       "type": "number"
                     }
                   ]
                 },
                 "type": "document"
               },
               "released": [
                 {
                   "type": "date"
                 }
               ],
               "title": [{
                 "type": "token"
               }, {
                 "type": "string"
               }]
             }
           }
         }

      For the preceding index definition, |fts| creates an index named
      ``default`` with :ref:`static mappings <static-dynamic-mappings>`
      on the specified fields. 

   .. tab:: ``listingsAndReviews`` Collection
      :tabid: airbnb

      The example queries against the
      ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`` collection use the following
      index. The index definition specifies dynamic mappings on the
      fields in the collection:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: true

         {
           "mappings": {
             "dynamic": true
           }
         }
  
   .. tab:: ``users`` Collection
      :tabid: users

      The ``users`` collection contains the following documents: 

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: true

         db.users.insertMany([
           {
             "_id": 0,
             "a": UUID("1a324de2-e34b-c87e-f2a1-42ce37ad74ed"),
             "b": "hello",
             "c": ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011")
           },
           {
             "_id": 1,
             "a": UUID("3b241101-e2bb-4255-8caf-4136c566a962"),
             "b": "hello",
             "c": true
           },
           {
             "_id": 2,
             "a": UUID("dee11d4e-63c6-4d90-983c-5c9f1e79e96c"),
             "b": "hello",
             "c": "foo"
           },
           {
             "_id": 3,
             "b": "hello",
             "c": UUID("3be11d4e-62cb-4e95-9a3c-5c9f1e56c732")
           },
           {
             "_id": 4,
             "a": UUID("d3c12e1c-c36e-25ed-7c3e-1e7f1e53c752"),
             "b": "hello",
             "c": null
           },
           {
             "_id": 5,
             "a": UUID("d73f181e-cdda-42b4-b844-4d6e172e9bc8"),
             "b": "hello",
             "c": []
           }
           {
             "_id": 6,
             "a": UUID("7eeddf21-b313-4a5c-81c2-c68915daa618"),
             "b": "hello",
           }
         ])

      The index definition for the ``users`` collection specifies the
      following: 

      - Dynamically index all the fields except fields named ``c``.
      - Statically index field named ``c`` as the following types for
        sorting:  

        - ``token``  
        - ``uuid`` 
        - ``objectId``
        - ``boolean``

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: true 
         :linenos:

         {         
           "mappings": {
             "dynamic": true,
             "fields": {
               "c": [
                { "type": "token" },
                { "type": "uuid" },
                { "type": "objectId" },
                { "type": "boolean" },
                { "type": "number" }
               ]
             }
           }
         }

      For the preceding collection, |fts| creates an index named
      ``default`` with the specified mappings on the specified fields.

The following query on the ``sample_mflix.movies`` namespace uses the
:pipeline:`$search` stage to do the following: 

- Search for movies that have the term ``country`` in the title.  
- Sort the results in ascending order using ``sort`` option. 

The query uses the :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to ``5``
documents. It also uses the :pipeline:`$project` stage to do the
following: 

- Omit all fields except ``title`` in the results.
- Add a field named ``score``.

Sort by Null Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following queries that search field ``b`` for the string ``hello`` in
the ``users`` collection using the :ref:`text <text-ref>` operator. The query then
sorts the results by field ``c``, which contains null or missing values for 
some documents in the collection.

To learn more, see :ref:`fts-sort-null`.

The order of documents with ``"_id": 4``, ``"_id": 5``, and ``"_id": 6`` 
is random because |fts| treats null and missing values as equal 
when sorting.

.. _fts-sort-eg-null-multiple-types:

Sort on Multi-Typed Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following queries on the :ref:`users collection <fts-sort-index>`
given an additional document with a multi-typed array in field ``c``:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true
   
   db.users.insertOne({
     "_id": 7,
     "a": UUID("03e32aa9-1cbd-43b8-b9d6-18b171a03cc7"),
     "b": "hello",
     "c": [ false, null, 15 ]
   })

The following queries search field ``b`` for the string ``hello`` 
using the :ref:`text <text-ref>` operator and sorts the results by field ``c``.

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Default
      :tabid: default

      .. note::

         Setting ``noData: lowest`` in your :ref:`sort syntax <sort-syntax-ref>` 
         is the same as the default.

      .. tabs:: 

         .. tab:: Ascending Sort
            :tabid: ascending-sort

            For an ascending sort, |fts| uses the element with the 
            lowest |bson| type to represent the multi-typed array.
            By default, |fts| considers null or missing values 
            as the lowest |bson| value. Therefore, 
            |fts| uses ``null`` to represent the multi-typed array for 
            the document with ``_id: 7`` and returns this document at 
            the top of the results along with other null and missing values.

            To learn more, see :ref:`fts-sort-null` and 
            :ref:`fts-sort-arrays-multiple-types`.

            For a descending sort, |fts| uses the element with the 
            highest |bson| type to represent the multi-typed array.
            |fts| uses ``false`` to represent the multi-typed array for 
            the document with ``_id: 7``, as this is the highest |bson| type
            in the array. Since |fts| also ranks ``true`` values above ``false`` values,
            |fts| returns this document after the document with ``_id: 1``.

            The query specifies ``noData: highest`` to consider 
            null or missing values as the highest |bson| value, so 
            |fts| uses ``15`` to represent the multi-typed array for 
            the document with ``_id: 7`` since numbers are the next 
            lowest |bson| type in the array.

Sort by Boolean
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query searches the ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews``
collection for properties in ``Portugal`` and sorts the results in 
descending order by the ``boolean`` field ``is_location_exact``.

The query uses the :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to ``5`` 
documents. It also uses the :pipeline:`$project` stage to omit all
fields except ``name``, ``property_type``, ``address.country``, and
``address.location.is_location_exact`` in the results.

In the preceding results, the value of ``is_location_exact`` is ``true``
for the documents because in a descending sort, |fts| ranks ``true``
values above ``false`` values. If you do an ascending sort by changing
the value on line 9 of the preceding query to ``1``, |fts| ranks the
documents with ``false`` values higher than ``true`` values and returns
the following documents:

Compound Search and Sort 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query uses the :pipeline:`$search` stage to do the
following: 

- Search for movies that have the term ``dance`` in the title, with
  a preference for movies that have won 2 or more awards and were
  released after 01 January, 1990.  
- Sort the results by the number of awards in descending order, then by
  the movie title in ascending order, and then by the release date in
  descending order. 

The query uses the :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to ``10``
documents. It also uses the :pipeline:`$project` stage to do the
following: 

- Omit all fields except ``title``, ``released``, and ``awards.wins`` in
  the results. 
- Add a field named ``score``.

Facet Search and Sort 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query uses the :pipeline:`$search` stage to do the
following: 

- Search for movies released between 01 January, 2010 and 01, January,
  2015 using the :ref:`range <range-ref>` operator. 
- Get a count of the number of movies that won ``1``, ``5``, ``10``, and
  ``15`` awards.
- Get a count of the number of movies released on ``2010-01-01``,
  ``2011-01-01``, ``2012-01-01``, ``2013-01-01``, ``2014-01-01``, and
  ``2015-01-01``.
- Sort the results in descending order of released date using the 
  ``sort`` option. 

The query uses the :pipeline:`$limit` stage to do the following: 

- Limit the output to ``5`` documents in the ``docs`` output field. 
- Limit the output to ``1`` document in the ``meta`` output field. 

It uses the :pipeline:`$project` stage to omit all fields except the
``awards.wins``, ``released``, and ``title`` fields.

It also uses the :pipeline:`$replaceWith` stage to include the metadata
results stored in the ``$$SEARCH_META`` variable in the ``meta`` output
field and the :pipeline:`$set` stage to add the ``meta`` field to the
results.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following examples demonstrate how to sort the results by the score
of the documents in the results. The examples demonstrate how to perform
the following actions: 

- Retrieve the lowest scoring documents first by sorting the results in
  ascending order.
- Sort the results by score in descending order and for results with
  identical scores, sort arbitrarily. 
- Sort the results by score and for results with identical scores, sort
  using a unique field.

   .. tab:: Sort by Unique Field
      :tabid: unique-field-sort

      The following query uses the :pipeline:`$search` stage to perform the
      following actions: 

      - Search for movies that have the term ``prince`` in the title.  
      - Sort the results first by score and then by the value of the
        ``released`` field in ascending order for results with identical
        scores.  

      The query uses the :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to ``5``
      documents. It also uses the :pipeline:`$project` stage to perform the
      following actions: 

      - Omit all fields except ``title`` and ``released`` in the results.
      - Add a field named ``score``.
