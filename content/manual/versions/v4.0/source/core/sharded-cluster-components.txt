A MongoDB :term:`sharded cluster` consists of the following components:

* :doc:`shard </core/sharded-cluster-shards>`: Each shard contains a
  subset of the sharded data. As of MongoDB 3.6, shards must be deployed
  as a :term:`replica set`.

* :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-query-router`: The ``mongos`` acts as a
  query router, providing an interface between client applications and the
  sharded cluster.

* :doc:`config servers </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`: Config
  servers store metadata and configuration settings for the cluster. As
  of MongoDB 3.4, config servers must be deployed as a replica set (CSRS).

Production Configuration
------------------------

In a production cluster, ensure that data is redundant and
that your systems are highly available. Consider the following
for a production sharded cluster deployment:

- Deploy Config Servers as a 3 member :term:`replica set`
- Deploy each Shard as a 3 member :term:`replica set`
- Deploy one or more :binary:`~bin.mongos` routers

Replica Set Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where possible, consider deploying one member of each replica set
in a site suitable for being a disaster recovery location.

Number of Shards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sharding requires at least two shards to distribute sharded data. Single
shard sharded clusters may be useful if you plan on enabling sharding in
the  near future, but do not need to at the time of deployment.

Number of ``mongos`` and Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploying multiple :binary:`~bin.mongos` routers supports high
availability and scalability. A common pattern is to place a
:binary:`~bin.mongos` on each application server. Deploying one
:binary:`~bin.mongos` router on each application server reduces network
latency between the application and the router.

Alternatively, you can place a :binary:`~bin.mongos` router on dedicated
hosts. Large deployments benefit from this approach because it decouples
the number of client application servers from the number of
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. This gives greater control over the number
of connections the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances serve.

Installing :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances on their own hosts allows these
instances to use greater amounts of memory. Memory would not be shared
with a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. It is possible to use primary shards
to host :binary:`~bin.mongos` routers but be aware that memory contention may
become an issue on large deployments.

There is no limit to the number of :binary:`~bin.mongos` routers you can
have in a deployment. However, as :binary:`~bin.mongos` routers
communicate frequently with your config servers, monitor config server
performance closely as you increase the number of routers. If you see
performance degradation, it may be beneficial to cap the number of
:binary:`~bin.mongos` routers in your deployment.

Development Configuration
-------------------------

For testing and development, you can deploy a sharded cluster with a
minimum number of components. These **non-production** clusters have the
following components:

- A replica set :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>` with one
  member.

- At least one shard as a single-member :term:`replica set`.

- One :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.
