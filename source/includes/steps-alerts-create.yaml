  In :guilabel:`Alert if`, select the target component. If you select
  ``Host``, you must also select the type of host.

  Next, select the condition and, if applicable, specify the threshold for
  the metric. For explanations of alert conditions and metrics, see
  :doc:`/reference/alerts`.

  In :guilabel:`For`, you can optionally filter the alert to apply only to
  a subset of the monitored targets. This option is available only if the
  targets are hosts or replica sets.

  For HipChat alerts, enter the HipChat room name and API token. Alerts
  will appear in the HipChat room message stream. See the :doc:`Settings page
  </core/settings>` to define default group alerts settings for HipChat.

  For `PagerDuty <http://www.pagerduty.com/?utm_source=mongodb&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partner>`_
  alerts, enter only the service key. Define escalation rules and alert
  assignments in PagerDuty. See the :doc:`Settings page

  For SNMP alerts, specify the hostname that will receive
  the v2c trap on standard port ``162``.

  The MIB file for SNMP is `available for download here
  <http://downloads.mongodb.com/on-prem-monitoring/MMS-10GEN-MIB.txt>`_.

  Users must ensure that they have entered the correct number into the
  :guilabel:`Alerts` window. MMS removes all punctuation and letters and
  only uses the digits for the telephone number.
