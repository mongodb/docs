content: |

  You can enable more than one authentication mechanism for your MongoDB
  deployment, but the |mms| Agents can only use *one* authentication
  mechanism. Select {{mechanism}} to connect to your MongoDB deployment.

  a. Check {{mechanism}} and/or {{mechanism2}} from :guilabel:`Agent Auth Mechanism`.

     |mms| automatically generates the Agents' usernames and passwords.
  
     |mms| creates users for the agents with the required user roles in
     the admin database for each existing deployment in |mms|. When you
     add a new deployment, |mms| creates the required users in the new
     deployment.

  b. Click :guilabel:`Save`.
