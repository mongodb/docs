   When starting *each* :binary:`~bin.mongod`, specify the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` settings either via a configuration file or the
   command line.

      **Configuration File**

      If using a configuration file, set:

      .. cssclass:: copyable-code

      .. code-block:: yaml

         sharding:
            clusterRole: shardsvr
         replication:
            replSetName: <replSetName>
         net:
            bindIp: localhost,<ip address>

      - :setting:`replication.replSetName` to the desired name of the
        replica set,

      - :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` option to ``shardsvr``,

      - :setting:`net.bindIp` option to the ip or a comma-delimited
        list of ips that remote clients (including the other members of
        the config server replica set as well as other members of the
        sharded cluster) can use to connect to the instance.

        .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

      - Additional settings as appropriate to your deployment, such as
        :setting:`storage.dbPath` and :setting:`net.port`. For more
        information on the configuration file, see :doc:`configuration
        options</reference/configuration-options>`.

      Start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the ``--config`` option set to
      the configuration file path.
    copyable: true
    language: sh
    code: |
       mongod --config <path-to-config-file>
  - pre: |
      **Command Line**

      If using the command line option,  start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` with
      the ``--replSet``, and ``--shardsvr``, ``--bind_ip`` options,
      and other options as appropriate to your deployment.  For example:

    copyable: true
    language: sh
    code: |
       mongod --shardsvr --replSet <replSetname>  --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address of the mongod host>

       For more information on startup parameters, see the
       :binary:`~bin.mongod` reference page.
