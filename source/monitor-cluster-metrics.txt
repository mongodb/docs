|service| collects and displays metrics for your servers, databases,
and MongoDB processes. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-cluster-metrics.rst

.. note::

   The number of servers that |service| displays on the 
   :guilabel:`Metrics` page at any given time depends on the browser 
   screen size. Use the :guilabel:`Toggle Members` section to control 
   which servers |service| displays. Hover over the ``S`` and ``P`` 
   icons to find out which servers they represent.

View Metrics
------------

       scaled to a range of 0-100% by dividing by the number of CPU 
       cores.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-system-cpu.rst

       To learn more, see :ref:`Fix IOPS Issues <disk-io-util>`, 
       :ref:`Fix Lost Primary <no-primary>`, and :ref:`Fix CPU Usage

       <replication-oplog-alerts>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Util %`

     - Percentage of time that requests are issued to and serviced 
       by disk. This metric includes requests from any process, not 
       just MongoDB processes.
         
       .. include:: /includes/fact-util-percent.rst
  
       To learn more, see :ref:`Fix IOPS Issues <disk-io-util>`.

.. _monitoring-storage-granularity:

Monitoring Data Storage Granularity
-----------------------------------

|service| stores metrics data at various granularity levels. For each
granularity level, |service| computes metrics as averages of the
reported metrics at the next finer granularity level.

.. example::

   At the end of a 60-minute period, |service| generates a 1-hour
   metrics report. |service| computes the value of the Connections
   metric in the 1-hour report as the average of all
   values for the Connections metric across the 60 1-minute reports
   that it generates in that hour.

|service| gathers metrics data at a 1-minute granularity unless you qualify for
premium monitoring.

When metrics data reach the end of their retention period, |service|
compacts them into a single unit of the next broader granularity level.

.. example::

   After 48 hours' worth of data is collected, |service| compacts each
   group of 60 minutes into a single unit of an hour. After 63 days,
   |service| compacts each group of 24 hours into a single unit of a day.

.. _burst-metrics:
   
Burst Reporting
--------------------------
   
Many metrics have a burst reporting equivalent. The value of a burst
reporting metric at a given granularity is the maximum reported value
from all the reports |service| generates at the next finer granularity
level during that interval.

.. example::

   The Disk IOPS metric has a Max Disk IOPS equivalent. |service|
   reports the Max Disk IOPS for a 1-hour interval as the highest Max
   Disk IOPS value across the 60 1-minute reports |service| generated
   in that hour. |service| reports the Max Disk IOPS for a 1-day
   interval as the highest Max Disk IOPS value across the 24 1-hour
   reports |service| generated in that hour.
   
.. _premium-monitoring:

Premium Monitoring Granularity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have at least one {+cluster+} that's ``M40`` or larger, |service|
automatically enables premium monitoring for all {+clusters+} in the project. With
premium monitoring enabled, |service| gathers metrics data at a 10-second
granularity. Premium monitoring remains enabled for all {+clusters+} in the project until you
downgrade or terminate your last ``M40`` cluster.

Metrics Data Retention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| retains metrics data for a period of time that depends on the granularity of the data:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Data Period
     - Duration of Retention

   * - 10 seconds :icon-fa5:`star`
     - 8 hours :icon-fa5:`star`
  
   * - 1 minute
     - 48 hours

   * - 5 minutes
     - 48 hours

   * - 1 hour
     - 63 days

   * - 1 day
     - Forever

:icon-fa5:`star` :ref:`Premium monitoring <premium-monitoring>` only.

|service| retains all database-specific statistics. MongoDB log data is
retained at a maximum rate of 2000 lines per 2 minutes.

.. note:: Historical metrics carryover

   If you create a new cluster with the same deployment type, name, and project as a previously deleted cluster,
   the historic metrics for the deleted cluster are carried over to the new cluster.

{+Free-Cluster+} and {+Shared-Cluster+} Monitoring Considerations
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+} support a subset of
  the metrics and charts available. For complete documentation on
  the limitations of ``M0/M2/M5`` {+clusters+},
  see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`.
  
- .. include:: /includes/fact-free-tier-monitoring-pause.rst

{+Serverless-Instance+} Monitoring Considerations
-------------------------------------------------

- {+Serverless-instances+} support a subset of the metrics and charts 
  available. For complete documentation on
  the limitations of {+Serverless-instances+},
  see :doc:`/reference/serverless-instance-limitations/`.

Manage Tags
-----------

You can add a tag, view existing tags, and manage tags from the 
:guilabel:`Clusters` page or the :guilabel:`Overview` 
page. To learn more, see :ref:`manage-tags-database-deployment-card` 
and :ref:`manage-tags-overview-page`.
