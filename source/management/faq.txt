If enabled on the `settings page`_, the |monitoring| application servers will
attempt to connect to your MongoDB instances to help ensure
that your firewall is properly configured. This is a weak security
validation that should not replace other auditing or intrusion
detection system procedures.

This test runs once per day and attempts to connect using both the IP
address and the non-canonical host identifier that you see in the
:guilabel:`Name` field of the Hosts page.

.. _`settings page`: https://mms.mongodb.com/settings

How do I modify my alert settings?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enable, disable, or modify alerts on the settings tab of the
*Activity* page.

How frequently can alerts be set?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alerts are processed on a 5 minute interval. Therefore, the minimum frequency
for an alert is 5 minutes.
