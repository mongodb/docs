.. versionadded:: 4.2

The official MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers provide a client-side field level
encryption framework. Applications can encrypt fields in documents *prior* to
transmitting data over the wire to the server. Only applications with access to
the correct encryption keys can decrypt and read the protected data. Deleting an
encryption key renders all data encrypted using that key as permanently
unreadable.

For example, a MongoDB cluster enforcing 
:ref:`authentication <authentication>` uses 
:ref:`TLS encryption <transport-encryption>` to protect data in transit.
The cluster also uses the 
:ref:`MongoDB encrypted storage engine <encrypted-storage-engine>` to
secure data on disk. Consider the following scenarios:

- An employee has administrative access to the cluster and its host 
  machines. The employee's access level allows them to view 
  high-sensitivity data in a decrypted state as part of their normal 
  duties.

- A third-party provider hosts the MongoDB cluster. The provider
  has a host-machine or database-level security breach where 
  unauthorized parties access the data in a decrypted state.

- A third-party data analytics firm has access to data that includes
  private, personal, or confidential information. The third-party
  firm loads the decrypted data into an unsecured data storage volume 
  which unauthorized parties can access.

With each scenario, a user with privileged access to either the MongoDB cluster
or a host machine can bypass encryption and read data that is private,
privileged, or confidential. Using client-side field level encryption to protect
data *prior* to being written to the server mitigates the risk of exposing that
data in the event network or disk encryption is bypassed.

Consider the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name" : "John Doe",
     "address" : {
       "street" : "1234 Main Street",
       "city" : "MongoDBVille",
       "zip" : 99999
     },
     "phone" : "949-555-1212",
     "ssn" : "123-45-6789"
   }

With client-side field level encryption, the application can 
specifically encrypt sensitive information like the ``ssn``
and ``phone``. Encrypted fields are stored as
:bsontype:`binary data <data_binary>` with 
`subtype 6 <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/client-side-encryption/subtype6.rst>`_:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name" : "John Doe",
     "address" : {
       "street" : "1234 Main Street",
       "city" : "MongoDBVille",
       "zip" : 99999
     },
     "phone" : BinData(6,"U2FsdGVkX1+CGIDGUnGgtS46+c7R5u17SwPDEmzyCbA="),
     "ssn" : BinData(6,"AaloEw285E3AnfjP+r8ph2YCvMI1+rWzpZK97tV6iz0jx")
   }

The :bsontype:`BinData <Binary>` blob metadata includes the Customer Master Key
(CMK) and data key used to encrypt the binary data. The 4.2-compatible drivers
and 4.2 :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell automatically decrypt ``BinData`` type 6 
fields. The automatic decryption process works as follows:

1. Read the metadata stored in the encrypted :bsontype:`BinData <Binary>` blob.

#. Check the key vault configured in the current database connection for the 
   specified data key.

#. Check the KMS configured in the current database connection for the
   specified CMK. 

#. Decrypt the data key using the CMK.

#. Decrypt the value using the data key.

Applications *must* have access to both the CMK *and* the data key associated to
the ``BinData`` blob to decrypt the value. Applications with access to the
MongoDB server that do not *also* have access to the required keys cannot
decrypt the ``BinData``.

MongoDB supports two methods of client-side field level encryption using the
official MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers:

Explicit (manual) encryption of fields
  MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers support explicitly encrypting
  or decrypting fields with a specific data key and encryption
  algorithm. 

  Applications must modify any code associated with constructing read and write
  operations to include encryption/decryption logic via the driver encryption
  library. Applications are responsible for selecting the appropriate data
  key for encryption/decryption on a per-operation basis.

Automatic encryption of fields
  MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise extends 4.2-compatible driver encryption support to 
  include :ref:`automatic field level encryption 
  <field-level-encryption-automatic>` 
  using :ref:`JSON schema syntax <field-level-encryption-json-schema>`.
  
  Applications must modify only the driver client object configuration code to
  include automatic encryption settings. All read/write operations to a cluster
  via the encryption-configured client are automatically encrypted and decrypted
  using the predefined automatic encryption rules. Code associated with
  constructing read and write operations does not require additional
  modification.

.. important::

   MongoDB client-side field level encryption only supports encrypting
   single fields in a document. To encrypt an entire document, you must
   encrypt each individual field in the document. 

.. _field-level-encryption-automatic:

Automatic Field Level Encryption
--------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-enterprise-only-admonition.rst

Official MongoDB 4.2-compatible drivers support automatic client-side field
level encryption. Applications configured for automatic client-side field level
encryption identify specific fields in documents for encryption and decryption.
4.2 drivers use the automatic encryption rules specified to the client for
identifying encrypted fields and their associated encryption keys.

For write operations, 4.2 drivers encrypt field values *prior* to writing
to the MongoDB database. For read operations, 4.2 drivers
encrypt field values in the query *prior* to issuing the read
operation. 4.2 drivers can decrypt encrypted values returned in a 
document *only if* the client has access to the encryption keys used
to protect the field.

Applications must specify the following components when
instantiating the client to enable automatic client-side field level encryption:

- A MongoDB cluster storing the key vault of data keys.

- The key vault namespace (``<database>.<collection>``) used to
  store encrypted data keys. 

- The Key Management Service (KMS) provider used to manage Customer Master
  Keys (CMK). MongoDB encrypts all data keys using the CMK *prior* to
  storing them in the key vault, leaving only metadata unencrypted.
  
  Drivers need access to the KMS to encrypt and decrypt protected
  fields *or* to create new data keys.

- Per-field encryption rules using 
  :ref:`JSON schema syntax <field-level-encryption-json-schema>`. 

The 4.2-compatible drivers use the Enterprise-only
:ref:`field-level-encryption-mongocryptd` process to parse the JSON
schema and apply the encryption rules when reading or writing documents.
Automatic encryption and decryption *requires* the ``mongocryptd``
process.

Each official MongoDB 4.2-compatible driver introduces new functionality
for supporting automatic encryption and data key management. Defer to
your preferred driver's documentation for language-specific instructions
on implementing automatic field level encryption.

.. _field-level-encryption-algorithms:

Encryption Algorithms
---------------------

MongoDB client-side field level encryption uses the encrypt-then-MAC approach
combined with either a deterministic or random initialization vector to encrypt
field values. MongoDB *only* supports the AES-256-CBC encryption algorithm with
HMAC-SHA-512 MAC. 

.. _field-level-encryption-deterministic:

Deterministic Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The deterministic encryption algorithm ensures a given input value *always*
encrypts to the same output value each time the algorithm is executed. While
deterministic encryption provides greater support for read operations, encrypted
data with low cardinality is susceptible to frequency analysis recovery.

For sensitive fields that are *not* used in read operations, applications may
use :ref:`field-level-encryption-random` for improved protection from frequency
analysis recovery.

.. _field-level-encryption-random:

Random Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The random encryption algorithm ensures that a given input value
*always* encrypts to a different output value each time the algorithm is
executed. While random encryption provides the strongest guarantees of
data confidentiality, it also prevents support for any read operations
which must operate on the encrypted field to evaluate the query.

Random encryption also supports encrypting entire objects or arrays. For
example, consider the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   {
    "personal_information" : {
      "ssn" : "123-45-6789",
      "credit_score" : 750,
      "credit_cards" : [ "1234-5678-9012-3456", "9876-5432-1098-7654"]
    },
    "phone_numbers" : [ "(212) 555-0153" ]
   }

Encrypting the ``personal_information`` and ``phone_numbers`` fields using the
random encryption algorithm encryptes the *entire* object. While this protects
all fields nested under those fields, it also prevents querying against those
nested fields. 

For sensitive fields that *are* used in read operations,
applications must use :ref:`field-level-encryption-deterministic` for improved
read support on encrypted fields.

Encryption Components
---------------------

MongoDB client-side field level encryption uses the following 
components:

- A third-party Key Management Service (KMS) for storing and retrieving
  a Customer Master Key (CMK). MongoDB currently only supports 
  `Amazon Web Services Key Management Service 
  <https://aws.amazon.com/kms/>`_.

  Alternatively, client-side field level encryption supports a local keyfile for
  encrypting data keys. Local keyfile data key encryption should be
  used only for development or evaluation purposes, and never in
  production environments.

- *Optional* Server-side :ref:`schema-validation-json` 
  that specifies encryption validation rules.

- A MongoDB cluster storing the key vault of data keys. Your key vault
  cluster can differ from the cluster in which you store
  client-encrypted data.

- The :ref:`field-level-encryption-mongocryptd` daemon for supporting 
  automatic encryption. Included in MongoDB Enterprise *only*.

- The ``libmongocrypt`` library that manages encryption, decryption,
  and communication between the KMS and ``mongocryptd``. Included with
  MongoDB 4.2 drivers.

The following diagram illustrates the relationships between the
driver and each encryption component:

.. _mongocryptd:

``mongocryptd``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*MongoDB Enterprise Only*

``mongocryptd`` is a driver-spawned client-side process that parses and
validates the JSON schema encryption rules. ``mongocryptd`` is a required
component for supporting automatic field encryption and decryption and
is included as a component in the 
:doc:`MongoDB  Enterprise Server 
</administration/install-enterprise>` package.

4.2 drivers automatically spawn the ``mongocryptd`` process if
available on the host system. Applications can control the spawning
behavior as part of the automatic encryption options. Defer to the
driver documentation for the specific options and syntax for
controlling ``mongocryptd`` spawning.
