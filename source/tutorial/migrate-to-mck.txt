Follow the steps for your deployment type to begin managing your MongoDB Enterprise and |mms| deployments
with |k8s-op-short| instead of the MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator.


Migrate from MongoDB Enterprise Operator to |k8s-op-short| for Most Deployments
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow these steps to migrate in most deployment scenarios. If you are using
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to manage 
your operator deployments, see :ref:`these steps <migrate-mck-olm>` instead.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Upgrade to v1.33 of the MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator.

   .. step:: Scale down the MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator to 0 replicas.
             
             This prevents both it and |k8s-op-short| from running in parallel.

   .. step:: Perform the following two tasks if you have deployed resources
             across multiple Kubernetes clusters:

             a. Back up the ``kubectl`` plug-in binary. This makes it easier 
                for you to reverse the migration to |k8s-op-short| if you encounter problems.

             b. Configure the member clusters by either :ref:`following the multi-cluster setup documentation <multi-cluster-rbac-manual>`
                (ensuring that you use the ``kubectl`` plugin from the |k8s-op-full| release) or 
                manually using Helm templating.

                .. important::

                   |k8s-op-short|\'s RBACs must be deployed to the member clusters before
                   deploying |k8s-op-short| in step 5. The new RBAC resources begin with ``mongodb-kubernetes-operator-``.
                   You must also ensure that the ``mongodb-kubernetes-operator-member-list`` is present on your 
                   operator cluster after running the newest version of the ``kubectl`` plug-in binary.

   .. step:: Install the |k8s-op-short| CRDs manually.

      .. code-block:: sh

         kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes/{+dl-version+}/public/crds.yaml

      To verify that the CRDs are installed on your Kubernetes cluster, search for the ``mongodbcommunity`` CRD:

      .. tip::

         The custom resource names for Ops Manager and MongoDB Enterprise have not changed in 
         |k8s-op-short|. Though you might not have MongoDB Community resources deployed,
         searching for ``mongodbcommunity`` custom resources is the simplest way
         to verify installation of the |k8s-op-short|.

      .. code:: sh

         kubectl get crds | grep mongodbcommunity

   .. step:: Install the new |k8s-op-short| Helm chart.

      .. warning::

         If you have overridden the default Helm chart values for your Enterprise Kubernetes Operator deployment,
         you should not use the same values for your |k8s-op-short| deployment as resource names could
         collide and prevent the migration from succeeding.

      .. code:: sh

         helm repo add mongodb https://mongodb.github.io/helm-charts && \
         helm repo update && \
         helm upgrade --install mongodb-kubernetes-operator mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes --namespace <your-namespace>
      
   .. step:: The |k8s-op-short| reconciler runs and processes the existing custom resources.

             |k8s-op-short| applies updated images, ``ServiceAccounts``, and other
             resources.

             .. important::

                This step triggers a rolling restart of deployed Pods, as the RBAC
                names have changed from the MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator to the
                |k8s-op-short|.

   .. step:: Wait for the resources to reconcile (reach the ``Running`` phase) and become healthy.

             |k8s-op-short| deploys one operator replica by default. If you want to run more than
             one replica, see `<https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes/blob/master/public/mongodb-kubernetes.yaml#L263>`__ 
             for details on scaling up the operator.

   .. step:: Remove old assets.

             You can now remove the Helm chart for the MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator, 
             as well as the RBACs on all Kubernetes clusters and any backed-up ``kubectl`` plug-in binaries.

             If you have deployed resources across multiple Kubernetes clusters,
             you can now safely remove the ``mongodb-enterprise`` from the member 
             clusters and delete your backed-up ``kubectl`` plug-in binary.

Migrate from MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator to |k8s-op-short| with the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To migrate from the MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator to the |k8s-op-short| using OLM, 
uninstall the old operator and then install the new one:

.. important::

   Removing the Enterprise Kubernetes Operator doesn't affect the database
   and |mms| resources that you deploy to Kubernetes. The migration process
   doesn't affect your workloads.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Delete the existing MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator Subscription. 
      
             Replace ``<subscription-namespace>`` and ``<subscription-name>`` with the values that 
             correspond to your resource.

             .. code-block:: sh
                :copyable: true

                kubectl -n <subscription-namespace> delete subscription <subscription-name>

   .. step:: Delete the ``ClusterServiceVersion`` (CSV) of the old MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator. 
      
             You can usually find the CSV name by listing the CSVs in the operator's namespace. 
             Replace ``<operator-namespace>`` and ``<csv-name>`` with the appropriate values.

             .. code-block:: sh
                :copyable: true

                kubectl -n <operator-namespace> delete csv <csv-name>

   .. step:: Install |k8s-op-short| from a catalog available on your cluster. 
      
             |k8s-op-short| is available in Red Hat's certified operators catalog,
             as well as the `operatorhub.io <https://operatorhub.io/>`__ catalog.
             
             .. code-block:: sh
                :copyable: true

                kubectl create -f <path-to-bundle>
