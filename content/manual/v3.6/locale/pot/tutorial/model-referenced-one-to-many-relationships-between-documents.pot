msgid "Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections <collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. Decisions that affect how you model data can affect application performance and database capacity. See :doc:`/core/data-models` for a full high level overview of data modeling in MongoDB."

msgid "When using references, the growth of the relationships determine where to store the reference. If the number of books per publisher is small with limited growth, storing the book reference inside the publisher document may sometimes be useful. Otherwise, if the number of books per publisher is unbounded, this data model would lead to mutable, growing arrays, as in the following example:"
