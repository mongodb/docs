.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: movePrimary

   In a :term:`sharded cluster`, this command reassigns the database's
   :term:`primary shard`, which holds all un-sharded collections in
   the database. :dbcommand:`movePrimary` is an administrative command
   that is only available for :program:`mongos` instances. Only use
   :dbcommand:`movePrimary` when removing a shard from a sharded
   cluster.

   .. important:: Only use :dbcommand:`movePrimary` when:

      - the database does not contain any collections, *or*

      - you have drained all sharded collections using the
        :dbcommand:`removeShard` command.

      See :doc:`/tutorial/remove-shards-from-cluster` for a complete
      procedure.

   :dbcommand:`movePrimary` changes the primary shard for this
   database in the cluster metadata, and migrates all un-sharded
   collections to the specified shard. Use the command with the
   following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { movePrimary : "test", to : "shard0001" }

   When the command returns, the database's primary location will
   shift to the designated :term:`shard`. To fully decommission a
   shard, use the :dbcommand:`removeShard` command.
   
   If the :dbcommand:`movePrimary` command moves any un-sharded collections 
   in the process, all :program:`mongos` instances need to be restarted
   or the :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` command needs to be invoked on all
   :program:`mongos` instances before writing any data, to notify them of the 
   primary shard change.
