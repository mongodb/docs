   There are two mutually exclusive options for Shard Keys:

   - Check :manual:`hashed </core/hashed-sharding>` if you want to use a
     hashed shard key.
   - Check :guilabel:`Enforce Unique Key` if you want to have unique key
     names.

   A Shard Key cannot be unique *and* hashed.

   - Check :guilabel:`Enforce Unique Key` if you want to have unique key
     names.

   A compound shard key cannot include more than three keys.
