Shards
======

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. TODO Intro paragraph .. following is just a placeholder.

A shard is a :term:`replica set` or a single :program:`mongod` that
contains a subset of the data for the sharded cluster. Together, the
cluster's shards hold the entire data set for the cluster.

Typically each shard is a replica set. The replica set provides
redundancy and high availability for the data in each shard.

.. important:: MongoDB shards data on a *per collection* basis. You
   *must* access all data in a sharded cluster via the
   :program:`mongos` instances. If you connect directly to a shard,
   you will see only its fraction of the cluster's data. There is no
   particular order to the data set on a specific shard. MongoDB does
   not guarantee that any two contiguous chunks will reside on a
   single shard.

Primary Shard
-------------

Every database has a "primary" [#overloaded-primary-term]_ shard that
holds all the un-sharded collections in that database.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-primary-shard.rst

To change the primary shard for a database, use the
:dbcommand:`movePrimary` command.

.. warning::

   The :dbcommand:`movePrimary` command can be expensive because it
   copies all non-sharded data to the new shard. During this time,
   this data will be unavailable for other operations.

When you deploy a new :term:`sharded cluster`, the "first" shard
becomes the primary shard for all existing databases before enabling
sharding. Databases created subsequently may reside on any shard in the
cluster.

.. [#overloaded-primary-term] The term "primary" shard has nothing to
   do with the term :term:`primary` in the context of :term:`replica
   sets <replica set>`.

Shard Status
------------

Use the :method:`sh.status()` method in the :program:`mongo` shell to
see an overview of the cluster. This reports includes which shard is
primary for the database and the :term:`chunk` distribution across the
shards. See :method:`sh.status()` method for more details.
