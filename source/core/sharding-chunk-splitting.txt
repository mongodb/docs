=================================
Chunk Splits in a Sharded Cluster
=================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

When a chunk grows beyond the :ref:`specified chunk size
<sharding-chunk-size>`, a :program:`mongos` instance will split the
chunk in half. Splits may lead to an uneven distribution of the
chunks for a collection across the shards. In such cases, the
:program:`mongos` instances will initiate a round of migrations to
redistribute chunks across shards. See :doc:`/core/sharding-balancing`
for more details on balancing chunks across shards.

Chunk Size
----------

.. todo:: link this section to <glossary:chunk size>

The default :term:`chunk` size in MongoDB is 64 megabytes. You can
:ref:`increase or reduce the chunk size
<sharding-balancing-modify-chunk-size>`, mindful of its effect on the
cluster's efficiency.

#. Small chunks lead to a more even distribution of data at the
   expense of more frequent migrations. This creates expense at the
   query routing (:program:`mongos`) layer.

#. Large chunks lead to fewer migrations. This is more efficient both
   from the networking perspective *and* in terms of internal overhead at
   the query routing layer. But, these efficiencies come at
   the expense of a potentially more uneven distribution of data.

For many deployments, it makes sense to avoid frequent and potentially
spurious migrations at the expense of a slightly less evenly
distributed data set.

Limitations
-----------

Changing the chunk size affects when chunks split but there are some
limitations to its effects.

- Automatic splitting only occurs during inserts or updates. If you
  lower the chunk size, it may take time for all chunks to split to the
  new size.

- Splits cannot be "undone". If you increase the chunk size, existing
  chunks must grow through inserts or updates until they reach the new
  size.

.. note::

   Chunk ranges are inclusive of the lower boundary and exclusive of
   the upper boundary.
