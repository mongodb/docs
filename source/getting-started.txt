Create an |service| User Account
--------------------------------

To get started with |service|, create your user account and log in to
|service|. If you are an existing |mms| user, you can use your |mms|
credentials.

Once logged in, create an |service| group.

Create an |service| Group
-------------------------

Your group will host your MongoDB deployments and have an associated
payment method. You can give other |service| users access to your
group, allowing them to log into the group and manage your deployments.
You can create multiple |service| groups.

.. Outstanding Questions
.. _____________________

.. Can a user have multiple payment methods?

.. If a user has an existing Cloud Manager group with no hosts, can they
   convert that to an Atlas group? Is there a UI for that?

.. An account = a registered user.
.. An account != group.
.. Billing is at the group level, not the account level.
