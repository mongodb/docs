====================================
Deploy a Standalone MongoDB Instance
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can deploy a :term:`standalone` MongoDB instance managed by |mms|. Use
standalone instances for testing and development.
**Do not** use these deployments, which lack replication and high
availability, for production systems. For all production deployments
use replica sets. See :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set` for
production deployments.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must have an existing server to which to deploy. For testing purposes,
you can use your localhost, or another machine to which you have access.

.. only:: cloud

   You can configure integration with an existing cloud service account so
   that you can provision servers directly from the |mms| interface. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-cloud-server-settings`.
