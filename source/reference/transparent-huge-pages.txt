Transparent Huge Pages (THP) Settings
=====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Transparent Huge Pages (THP) is a Linux memory management kernel
module used to reduce the overhead of Translation Lookaside Buffer
(TLB) lookups on machines with large amounts of memory, and therefore
a large number of memory pages. In effect, it presents system memory
as a smaller number of much larger pages rather than as a larger
number of 4096-byte pages.

However, THP is known to perform poorly under database workloads,
which tend to have sparse rather than contiguous memory access
patterns. You must disable THP on Linux machines used to run MongoDB
instances to ensure best performance.

There are three ways to disable Transparent Huge Pages on Linux.

In Boot-Time Configuration (Preferred)
--------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/disable-thp-in-grub.rst

Using ``tuned`` and ``ktune`` (Necessary if you use ``tuned``)
--------------------------------------------------------------

``tuned`` and ``ktune`` are dynamic kernel tuning tools that act in
accordance with policies set by the system administrator. One of the
settings available to ``tuned`` and ``ktune`` is whether or not to use
THP.

To disable transparent hugepages, you need to edit or create a new
profile that sets THP to ``never``.

.. include:: /includes/steps/disable-thp-in-ktune.rst

In ``/etc/rc.local`` (Alternate)
--------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/disable-thp-in-rc.local.rst

Test Your Changes
-----------------

Whichever of the three methods you use, you can check the status of THP support by issuing the command:

.. code:: sh

   cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

or

.. code:: sh

   cat /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled

on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and potentially other Red
Hat-based derivatives.

Correct output resembles:

.. code:: sh

   always madvise [never]
