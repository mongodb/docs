   For instance, the inequality operators :query:`$nin` and
   :query:`$ne` are *not* very selective since they often match a large
   portion of the index. As a result, in many cases, a :query:`$nin` or
   :query:`$ne` query with an index may perform no better than a
   :query:`$nin` or :query:`$ne` query that must scan all documents in
   a collection.
