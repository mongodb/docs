.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: filemd5

   The :dbcommand:`filemd5` command returns the :term:`md5` hashes for a single
   file stored using the :term:`GridFS` specification. Client libraries
   use this command to verify that files are correctly written to MongoDB.
   The command takes the ``files_id`` of the file in question and the
   name of the GridFS root collection as arguments. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { filemd5: ObjectId("4f1f10e37671b50e4ecd2776"), root: "fs" }

   .. read-lock

   MongoDB computes the ``filemd5`` using all data in the GridFS file object
   pulled sequentially from each chunk in the ``chunks`` collection.
