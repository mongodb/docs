===================================
Control Search Results with Weights
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

Text search assigns a score to each document that contains the search
term in the indexed fields. The score determines the relevance of a
document to a given search query.

.. include:: /includes/fact-text-index-weight.rst

.. warning::

   Choose the weights carefully in order to prevent the need to reindex.

A collection ``blog`` has the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: 1,
     content: "This morning I had a cup of coffee.",
     about: "beverage",
     keywords: [ "coffee" ]
   }

   {
     _id: 2,
     content: "Who doesn't like cake?",
     about: "food",
     keywords: [ "cake", "food", "dessert" ]
   }

To create a ``text`` index with different field weights for the
``content`` field and the ``keywords`` field, include the ``weights``
option to the :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` method. For
example, the following command creates an index on three fields and
assigns weights to two of the fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.blog.createIndex(
      {
        content: "text",
        keywords: "text",
        about: "text"
      },
      {
        weights: {
          content: 10,
          keywords: 5
        },
        name: "TextIndex"
      }
    )

The ``text`` index has the following fields and weights:

- ``content`` has a weight of 10,

- ``keywords`` has a weight of 5, and

- ``about`` has the default weight of 1.

These weights denote the relative significance of the indexed fields to
each other. For instance, a term match in the ``content`` field has:

- ``2`` times (i.e. ``10:5``) the impact as a term match in the
  ``keywords`` field and

- ``10`` times (i.e. ``10:1``) the impact as a term match in the
  ``about`` field.

.. note::

   For data hosted on MongoDB Atlas,
   :atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>` provides more robust custom
   scoring than ``text`` indexes. To learn more, see the Atlas Search
   :atlas:`Scoring </reference/atlas-search/scoring/>` documentation.
