Atlas Device Sync uses space in your app's synced Atlas cluster to store
metadata for sync. This includes a history of changes to each synced database.
Atlas App Services minimizes this space usage in your Atlas cluster.
Minimizing metadata is necessary to reduce the time and data needed for sync.

.. _sync-history:

History
-------

The App Services backend keeps a history of :ref:`changes to
underlying data <changesets>` for each realm, similar to the
:manual:`MongoDB oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>`. App Services
uses this history to synchronize data between the backend and clients.
App Services stores history in your synced Atlas cluster.

.. _trimming:

Trimming
--------

When you set a client maximum offline time in an App, **trimming** deletes
changes older than the client maximum offline time.

.. _client-maximum-offline-time:

Client Maximum Offline Time
---------------------------

Used in trimming, the **client maximum offline time** controls the age limit of history.
This indirectly changes how long a client can remain offline between
synchronization sessions with the backend. Clients that do not
synchronize for more than the specified number of days
may experience a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` the next time they
connect with the backend.

Setting the client maximum offline time to a lower value will decrease the amount
of history required by sync. The resulting optimization lowers storage usage
in the synced Atlas cluster.

New Apps automatically enable client maximum offline time with a default
value of 30 days.

.. warning:: Client Maximum Offline Time Causes Permanent Changes to History

   Client maximum offline time enables trimming for
   older history. This permanently changes affected
   history and can cause client resets in the future.

Key Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sync should always converge at the same end state on all clients. In
order to converge during a sync, clients require the full history of
changes beginning immediately after their last sync. When a client does
not sync for a long period of time, trimming can
alter the history in ways that prevent the client from converging. Since
synchronization relies on all clients converging on a common result,
such a client cannot synchronize.

As a result, the client must complete a client reset before it can
resume synchronization. In a client reset scenario, the client deletes
the client-local copy of a realm and downloads the current state of
that realm from the backend. Synchronization then resumes using the
new copy of the realm.

The client maximum offline time controls how long your backend waits
before applying trimming. After the specified number
of days without syncing, clients may experience a client reset the next
time they connect with the backend.

Applications that do not specify the client maximum offline time never
apply trimming. This means that clients can connect
after any period of time offline -- weeks, months, or even years --
and synchronize changes. As time passes, frequently-edited realms
accumulate many changes. With a large changeset, synchronization
requires more time and data usage.

Client Maximum Offline Time Does Not Immediately Influence Client Resets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trimming causes permanent, irreversible changes to
history. As a result, increasing the client maximum offline time does
not *immediately* change the length of time before clients experience a
client reset. Existing history has already been changed by trimming,
requiring a client reset. New history needs time to accumulate up to
the new client maximum offline time.

Decreasing client maximum offline time does not *immediately*
change the length of time before clients experience a client reset.
Client resets begin taking place earlier once the regularly scheduled
trimming job applies trimming to the newly
eligible history.

      :tabid: ui

      1. From the App Services UI, click :guilabel:`Device Sync` menu in the
         sidebar. The :guilabel:`Dashboard` tab displays by default.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Configuration` tab.

      #. Scroll down to the :guilabel:`Advanced Configuration (optional)`
         section, and click the dropdown to expand the section.

           :width: 750px
           :alt: Advanced Configuration section in the App Services UI

      #. Under the :guilabel:`Client Max Offline Time` section, specify a number
         of days for your application's client maximum offline time. The default
         value is 30 days. The minimum value is 1.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Save Changes` button at the bottom of the screen
         once you are ready to save.

      #. In the confirmation window, click the :guilabel:`Save Changes` button again
         to confirm changes.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      1. Pull a local copy of the latest version of your app with the
         following :ref:`pull command <appservices-pull>`:

         .. code-block:: bash
            :caption: Pull

            {+cli-bin+} pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

      2. You can configure the number of days for your application's
         client maximum offline time with the ``client_max_offline_days``
         property in your app's ``sync/config.json`` file:

         .. code-block:: json
            :caption: ``sync/config.json``

            {
               "client_max_offline_days": 42,
            }

      3. Deploy the updated app configuration with the following
         :ref:`push command <appservices-push>`:

         .. code-block:: bash
            :caption: Push

            {+cli-bin+} push --remote="<Your App ID>"

.. _optimizing-performance-and-storage-flexible-sync:

Optimizing Performance and Storage When Using Flexible Sync
-----------------------------------------------------------

For Flexible Sync configuration, the amount of Atlas storage space used is
directly proportional to the number of queryable fields you have set up.
Queryable fields use storage on the backing Atlas cluster. The more queryable
fields you configure, the more storage you use on the backing cluster.

If you have a large number of collections in an App, you may need to use the
same queryable field name across multiple collections. Combine this with
:ref:`permissions <permissions>` for more granular control over who can access
which collections.

.. example::

   Your app may contain 20 or 30 collections, but you want to minimize the
   number of queryable fields. You can re-use **global queryable fields**
   across collections in order to sync objects from every collection.
   For example, ``owner_id`` might be a field you want to query in multiple
   collections.

   Alternately, you may have ``owner_id`` in multiple collections, but only
   need to query on it in one collection. In this case, you might make
   ``owner_id`` a **collection queryable field**. This means Sync only has to
   maintain metadata about this field for one collection, instead of storing
   metadata for all of the collections where you're not querying on this
   field.

   Finally, for Apps where devices want to query one specific facet of the
   data, such as ``owner_id == user.id``, you may want to designate the
   field an **indexed queryable field**. Indexed queryable fields provide more
   efficient performance for Apps where the client only needs to sync on a
   small subset of their data - a group of stores or a single user, for
   example.

   You can have one indexed queryable field per App. An indexed queryable
   field is a **global queryable field** that must be present and use the
   same eligible data type in each collection you sync.

   For more information, refer to :ref:`queryable-field-scopes` and
   :ref:`fs-indexed-queryable-fields`.

For best performance, open a synced realm with a broad query. Then, add
more refined queries to expose targeted sets of data in the client
application. Slicing off working sets from a broad query provides
better performance than opening multiple synced realms using more
granular queries.

When you configure queryable fields, consider the broad queries you use
for Sync, and select fewer fields that support those broad queries.

.. example::

   In a to-do list app, prefer broad queries such as ``assignee == currentUser``
   or ``projectName == selectedProject`` for a Sync query. This gives you a
   couple of broad fields against which to Sync documents. In the client, you
   can further refine your query for things like tasks of a certain priority
   or completion status to slice off a working set.

Summary
-------

- Device Sync uses space in your synced Atlas cluster to store change history.
- Trimming reduces the space usage for Flexible Sync apps, but can cause client resets
  for clients who have not connected to the backend in more than
  the client maximum offline time (in days).
- Adding additional queryable fields to a flexible sync configuration
  will increase storage consumed on an Atlas Cluster. Using broad queries
  and selecting fewer fields that support broad queries decreases storage consumed.
