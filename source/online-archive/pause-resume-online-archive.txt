You can pause and resume archiving from the |service| UI and |api|. 
When you pause, previously archived documents continue to be available 
on the cloud object storage for querying, but archiving activity for 
the collection on your |service| cluster is stopped until you resume 
archiving. You will continue to incur costs for storage on the cloud 
object storage and for reading data. When you resume archiving, data 
that meets the criteria for archiving is archived. 

You can pause an online archive and create another online archive for the same 
namespace and partition fields as the paused online archive, but only one 
online archive can be ``Active``. So, if you try to resume a paused online 
archive when another online archive for the same namespace is ``Active``, the 
resume operation will fail. You must either delete or pause the ``Active`` 
online archive to resume archiving for the paused online archive.
