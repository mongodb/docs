|service| uses your |gcp| Service Account Key to encrypt and decrypt
your MongoDB master keys. These MongoDB master keys are used to encrypt
cluster database files and
:ref:`cloud providers snapshots <backup-cloud-provider>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-atlas-key-rotation.rst

|service| encrypts your data at rest using encrypted storage media.
Using keys you manage with |gcp| |kms|, |service| encrypts your
data a second time when it writes it to the MongoDB
:manual:`encrypted storage engine </core/security-encryption-at-rest>`.
You use your |gcp| |sak| to encrypt the MongoDB master encryption keys.

This page covers configuring customer key management using |akv| on
your |service| project.

You must configure customer key management for the |service| project
before enabling it on clusters in that project.

Enable Customer-Managed Keys for a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must enable customer key management for a project before you can
enable it on a cluster in that project.

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-gcp-encryption-for-project.rst

Alerts
------

|service| automatically creates an :alert:`encryption key rotation alert <GCP encryption key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days>`
once you configure customer key management for a project. You can reset this alert at any time by
:ref:`rotating your GCP Key Version Resource ID <gcp-kms-rotate-key>`.
