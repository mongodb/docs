You can use |service| to generate aggregation queries using natural 
language. |service| uses AI to generate aggregations based on prompts 
you provide. Querying with natural language can be a helpful starting point and 
assist you in learning to write MongoDB queries.

.. note::

   .. include:: /atlas-ui/includes/shared/fact-natural-language-query.rst

About this Task
---------------

You can also provide natural language prompts on the 
:ref:`documents tab <atlas-ui-prompt-natural-language-query>`.

Before you Begin
----------------

You must :ref:`enable natural language querying 
<atlas-ui-enable-natural-language-querying>`.

Steps
-----

The examples on this page use the :ref:`sample_mflix.movies <sample-mflix>` 
collection from the Atlas sample dataset.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Navigate to the :guilabel:`Natural Language Query Bar`
      
      a. Select the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Generate aggregation` button.

      #. .. include:: /includes/fact-natural-language-query-accept.rst

   .. step:: Type a question about your collection

      Type a natural language prompt for your collection into the query 
      bar. Aggregation pipeline prompts usually have an aggregation verb 
      such as count, average, or sum with logical conditions. For 
      example: ``How many movies have more than 3 writers 
      in the writers array?``

      a. Press enter or click the :guilabel:`Generate aggregation` button.
      #. An aggregation pipeline populates in the :guilabel:`Pipeline` 
         bar. You can scroll down to see the syntax of each stage.

   .. step:: Run the aggregation

      a. Before running the query, make sure to thoroughly review the 
         syntax of each stage. Ensure the returned pipeline has the 
         fields and stages that match your desired use case.

      b. Click the :guilabel:`Run` button to execute the pipeline.

      The results populate in the aggregations view.

Examples
--------

Below are examples of prompts to help you understand expected results 
when using natural language prompts for aggregation.
