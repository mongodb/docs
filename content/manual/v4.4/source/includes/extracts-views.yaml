ref: views-behavior
content: |

   Views exhibit the following behavior:

   Read Only
   ~~~~~~~~~

   Views are read-only; write operations on views will error.
   
   The following read operations can support views:
      
   - :method:`db.collection.find()`
   - :method:`db.collection.findOne()`
   - :method:`db.collection.aggregate()`
   - :method:`db.collection.countDocuments()`
   - :method:`db.collection.estimatedDocumentCount()`
   - :method:`db.collection.count()`
   - :method:`db.collection.distinct()`

   Index Use and Sort Operations
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   - Views use the indexes of the underlying collection.

   - As the indexes are on the underlying collection, you cannot
     create, drop or re-build indexes on the view directly nor get a
     list of indexes on the view.

   - Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can specify a :operator:`$natural`
     sort when running a :dbcommand:`find` command on a view. Prior
     versions of MongoDB do not support :operator:`$natural` sort on
     views.

   - The view's underlying aggregation pipeline is subject to the 100
     megabyte memory limit for blocking sort and blocking group
     operations. Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can issue a
     :dbcommand:`find` command with ``allowDiskUse: true`` on the view
     to allow MongoDB to use temporary files for blocking sort and group
     operations.

     Prior to MongoDB 4.4, only the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command
     accepted the ``allowDiskUse`` option.

     .. seealso::
        
        For more information on blocking sort operation memory limits,
        see :limit:`Sort Operations`.

   Projection Restrictions

   Immutable Name
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-rename.rst

   View Creation
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   - Views are computed on demand during read operations, and MongoDB
     executes read operations on views as part of the underlying
     aggregation pipeline. As such, views do not support operations
     such as:

     - :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`,

     - :query:`$text` operator, since ``$text`` operation in
       aggregation is valid only for the first stage,

     - :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline stage.

   - If the aggregation pipeline used to create the view suppresses the
     ``_id`` field, documents in the view do not have the ``_id`` field.

   When you query a view, the:

   - Query ``filter``, ``projection``, ``sort``, ``skip``, ``limit``,
     and other operations for :method:`db.collection.find()` are
     converted to the equivalent :ref:`aggregation pipeline stages
     <aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>`.
   
   - Converted aggregation pipeline stages are added to the end of the
     :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` for the view.
     This does not modify the view's underlying pipeline, which is set
     when you create the view.
   
   - :doc:`Aggregation pipeline optimizer
     </core/aggregation-pipeline-optimization>` reshapes the view
     aggregation pipeline stages to improve performance. This does not
     change the query results.

   Sharded View
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   Views are considered sharded if their underlying collection is
   sharded. As such, you cannot specify a sharded view for the ``from``
   field in :pipeline:`$lookup` and :pipeline:`$graphLookup` operations.

   Views and Collation

ref: views-collation-behavior
content: |

   - You can specify a default :doc:`collation </reference/collation>`
     for a view at creation time. If no collation is specified, the
     view's default collation is the "simple" binary comparison
     collator. That is, the view does not inherit the collection's
     default collation.

   - String comparisons on the view use the view's default collation.
     An operation that attempts to change or override a view's default
     collation will fail with an error.

   - If creating a view from another view, you cannot specify a
     collation that differs from the source view's collation.

   - .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-collation-agg.rst
---
ref: views-collation-agg
content: |

   If performing an aggregation that involves multiple views, such as
   with :pipeline:`$lookup` or :pipeline:`$graphLookup`, the views must
   have the same :doc:`collation  </reference/collation>`.
---
ref: views-public-definition
content: |
   The view definition is public; i.e. :method:`db.getCollectionInfos()`
   and ``explain`` operations on the view will include the pipeline that
   defines the view. As such, avoid referring directly to sensitive fields
   and values in view definitions.
---
ref: views-restriction-output-to-disk
content: |

   The view definition ``pipeline`` cannot
   include the :pipeline:`$out` or the :pipeline:`$merge` stage. If the view definition includes
   nested pipeline (e.g. the view definition includes
   :pipeline:`$lookup` or :pipeline:`$facet` stage), this
   restriction applies to the nested pipelines
   as well.
---
ref: views-access-control
content: |

  If the deployment enforces :ref:`authentication <authentication>`,
  :method:`db.createView()` requires that the authenticated user have
  the :authaction:`createCollection` privilege on the database.

  However, if the user has the :authaction:`createCollection` on the
  database *and* :authaction:`find` on the view to create, the user must
  *also* have the following additional permissions:

  - :authaction:`find` on the source collection or view.

  - :authaction:`find` on any other collections or views referenced in the
    ``pipeline``, if any.

  A user with the :authrole:`readWrite` built in role on the database
  has the required privileges to run the listed operations. Either
  :doc:`create a user </tutorial/create-users>` with the required role
  or :ref:`grant the role to an existing user
  <modify-existing-user-access>`
