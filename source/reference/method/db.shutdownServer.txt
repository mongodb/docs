.. method:: db.shutdownServer()

   Shuts down the current :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   process cleanly and safely. You must issue the
   :method:`db.shutdownServer()` operation against the 
   :term:`admin database`.

   :method:`db.shutdownServer()` has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.shutdownServer({ 
        force: <boolean>,
        timeoutSecs: <int> 
      })

   The method takes the following optional field:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 80

      * - Field
        - Description

      * - :ref:`force <shutdownServer-method-force>`

        - .. _shutdownServer-method-force:
        
          Optional. Specify ``true`` to force the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
          to shut down. Force shutdown interrupts any ongoing 
          operations on the :binary:`~bin.mongod` and may result in
          unexpected behavior.

      * - :ref:`timeoutSecs <shutdownServer-method-timeoutSecs>`

        - .. _shutdownServer-method-timeoutSecs:
        
          Optional. The number of seconds the :term:`primary` should 
          wait for a secondary to catch up. Defaults to ``10``.

          If no secondaries catch up within the specified time, the 
          command fails. 

This operation provides a wrapper around the :dbcommand:`shutdown`
command.

Behavior
--------

For a :binary:`~bin.mongod` started *with* :ref:`authentication`, you
must run :method:`db.shutdownServer()` over an authenticated connection.
See :ref:`method-shutdown-access-control` for more information.

For a :binary:`~bin.mongod` started *without* :ref:`authentication`, you
must run :method:`db.shutdownServer()` from a client connected to the
localhost interface. For example, run a :binary:`~bin.mongo` with the
:option:`--host "127.0.0.1" <mongo --host>` option on the same host
machine as the :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

.. _method-shutdown-replica-set:

``db.shutdownServer()`` on Replica Set Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:method:`db.shutdownServer()` fails if the :binary:`~bin.mongod` replica
set member is running certain operations such as :ref:`index builds
<index-operations-replicated-build>`. You can specify :ref:`force: true
<shutdownServer-method-force>` to force the member to interrupt those
operations and shut down.

Shutting Down the Replica Set Primary
`````````````````````````````````````

If running :method:`db.shutdownServer()` against the replica set
:term:`primary`, the operation implicitly uses
:dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` to step down the primary before shutting
down the :binary:`~bin.mongod`. If no secondary in the replica set can
catch up to the primary within ``10`` seconds, the shutdown operation
fails. You can issue :method:`~db.shutdownServer()` with 
:ref:`force: true <shutdownServer-method-force>` to shut down the 
primary *even if* the step down fails.

.. warning::

   Force shutdown of the primary can result in the 
   :ref:`rollback <replica-set-rollback>` of any writes not 
   yet replicated to a secondary. 

.. _method-shutdown-access-control:

Access Control
--------------

To run :method:`db.shutdownServer()` on a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
enforcing :ref:`authentication`, the authenticated user *must* have the
:method:`db.shutdownServer()` privilege. For example, a user with the
built-in role :authrole:`hostManager` has the appropriate permissions.

Examples
--------

Shut down a ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("admin").shutdownServer()

Force Shut Down a ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("admin").shutdownServer({ "force" : true })

Shut Down a Primary ``mongod`` With Longer Timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("admin").shutdownServer({ "timeoutSecs": 60 })
