`````````````````````
You can set an alert for when MongoDB instance changes. Host status
conditions include:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Condition
     - Alert Trigger

   * - Host added
     - |mms| starts monitoring or managing a :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` or
       :binary:`~bin.mongos` process for the first time.

   * - Host removed
     - |mms| stops monitoring or managing a :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` or
       :binary:`~bin.mongos` process for the first time.

   * - Host added to replica set
     - Specified type of :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` process is added to a
       :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`.

   * - Host removed from replica set
     - Specified type of :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` process is removed from
       a :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`.

   * - Host has restarted
     - |mms| detects that a host has been restarted.

   * - Restarts in Last Hour is
     - |mms| detects that the number of times a host restarted within
       the previous hour exceeds the specified threshold.

   * - Host experienced a rollback
     - |mms| detects that a :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` on a host triggered a
       rollback.

       The following host types can't experience rollbacks:

       - :term:`arbiters <arbiter>`
       - :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>`

       To learn more, see :manual:`Rollbacks During Replica Set Failover </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`.

   * - Host is recovering
     - A :manual:`secondary </reference/glossary/#std-term-secondary>` enters the :replstate:`RECOVERING` state. To
       learn more about the :replstate:`RECOVERING` state, see
       :manual:`Replica Set Member States </reference/replica-states>`.

   * - Host does not have the latest version
     - Revision of MongoDB running on a host is two or more
       revisions behind the current stable release of MongoDB.

       For example, if the current stable release is MongoDB 4.0.9, a host
       running MongoDB 4.0.8 would not trigger an alert but a host
       running MongoDB version 4.0.7 would trigger an alert.

       To learn more about MongoDB version numbering, see
       :ref:`MongoDB Version Numbers <release-version-numbers>`
       in the MongoDB manual.

   * - Host's SSL certificate will expire within 30 days
     - SSL certificate for a MongoDB instance is 30 days from
       expiration. |mms| resends the alert every 24 hours until
       resolved or acknowledged. If you do not resolve or acknowledge
       the alert and the certificate expires, |mms| continues to send
       the alert. If the certificate expires, the {+magent+} can
       no longer connect to the MongoDB instance.

   * - System: CPU (Steal) % is
     - *Applicable when the EC2 instance credit balance is exhausted.*

       The percentage of time the CPU is in a state of "involuntary
       wait". CPU steal percentage is the percentage by which the CPU
       usage exceeds the guaranteed baseline CPU credit accumulation
       rate.

       This alert typically triggers when all credits have been
       consumed on an `AWS burstable performance instance
       <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html>`__.

   * - System: Max CPU (Steal) % is

.. _replica-set-alerts:

Replica Set Alerts
------------------

You may set alerts about the status of the :manual:`primary </reference/glossary/#std-term-primary>` and the
number of healthy members in a :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`. Replica set
conditions include:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Condition
     - Alert Trigger

   * - Replica set elected a new primary
     - A set elects a new :manual:`primary </reference/glossary/#std-term-primary>`. Each time |mms| receives a
       ping, it inspects the output of the replica set's
       :manual:`rs.status() </reference/method/rs.status>` method for
       the status of each replica set member. From this output, |mms|
       determines which replica set member is the primary. If the
       primary found in the ping data is different than the current
       primary known to |mms|, this alert triggers.

       Receiving this alert does not always mean that the set elected a
       *new* primary. This alert may also trigger when the same primary
       is re- elected. This can happen when |mms| processes a ping in
       the midst of an election.

   * - Replica set has no primary
     - A replica set does not have a :manual:`primary </reference/glossary/#std-term-primary>`. Specifically,
       when none of the members of a replica set have a status of
       ``PRIMARY``, the alert triggers. For example, this condition may
       arise when a set has an even number of voting members resulting
       in a tie.

       If the {+magent+} collects data during an
       :manual:`election for primary </core/replica-set-elections>`,
       this alert might send a false positive. To prevent such false
       positives, set the alert configuration's :guilabel:`after
       waiting` interval (in the configuration's :guilabel:`Send to`
       section).

       For resolutions, see :doc:`/reference/alerts/no-primary`.

Replica set metrics include:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Metric
     - Alert Trigger

   * - Number of healthy members is
     - A replica set has fewer healthy members than your specified
       threshold.

   * - Number of unhealthy members is
     - A replica set has more unhealthy members than your specified
       threshold.

   * - Number of elections in last hour is > X
     - Number of elections that have occurred in the last hour
       exceeded the user-specified value of ``X``. The value of ``X``
       is set when you create the alert. This alert may indicate that
       the cluster's replication is not in a healthy state, as
       evidenced by constant elections.

.. note::

   A replica set member is healthy if you run
   :manual:`rs.status() </reference/method/rs.status>` for that
   replica set and the result returns :replstate:`PRIMARY` or
   :replstate:`SECONDARY` for that member. Hidden secondaries and
   arbiters are not counted.


Sharded Cluster Alerts
----------------------

You may set an alert for a ``mongos`` missing from a
:manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`. Sharded cluster conditions include:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Condition
     - Alert Trigger

   * - Cluster is missing an active mongos
     - |mms| cannot reach **any** :binary:`~bin.mongos` for the cluster.

Agent Alerts
------------

You may set alerts for agent status or versioning. Agent conditions
include:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Condition
     - Alert Trigger

   * - {+aagent+} is down
     - No {+aagent+} is detected for at least 1 minute. Under
       normal operation, the {+aagent+} sends a ping to |mms|
       roughly once every 10 seconds. If |mms| does not receive a ping
       for at least 1 minute, this alert triggers. 
       
       This alert triggers only if the {+aagent+} is managing a
       MongoDB process or agent module.

   * - {+magent+} is down
     - No {+magent+} is detected for at least 7 minutes. Under
       normal operation, the {+magent+} sends a ping to |mms|
       roughly once per minute. If |mms| does not receive a ping for at
       least 7 minutes, this alert triggers. However, this alert never
       triggers for a project that has no hosts configured.

       :gold:`IMPORTANT:` When the {+magent+} is down, |mms| triggers
       no other alerts for any host. For example: if a host is down, there is no {+magent+} to send data to |mms| that could trigger new alerts.

   * - {+magent+} does not have the latest version
     - {+magent+} is not running the latest version of the
       software.

   * - {+bagent+} is down
     - {+bagent+} for a project with at least one active replica
       set or cluster is down for more than 1 hour.

       To resolve this alert:

       #. To see which host serves the {+bagent+}:

          a. .. include:: /includes/nav/list-deployment.rst

          #. .. include:: /includes/nav/list-servers.rst

       #. Check the {+bagent+} log file on that host.

.. _backup-alert-conditions:

Backup Alerts
-------------

You may set alerts for backup oplog, resync and inconsistencies. Backup
conditions include:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Condition
     - Alert Trigger

   * - Backup oplog is behind
     - Most recent :manual:`oplog </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>` data received by |mms| is more
       than 75 minutes old.

       To resolve this alert, see
       :doc:`/reference/alerts/backup-oplog-is-behind`.

   * - Backup requires a resync
     - Replication process for a backup falls too far behind the
       :manual:`oplog </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>` to catch up. This occurs when the host overwrites
       oplog entries that backup has not yet replicated. When this
       happens, you must resync backup, as described in the procedure
       :doc:`/tutorial/resync-backup`.

       Also, check the corresponding {+bagent+} log. If you see a
       "Failed Common Points" test, one of the following may have
       happened.

       - A significant rollback event occurred on the backed-up replica
         set.

       - :manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>` for the
         backed-up replica set was resized or deleted.

       - High oplog churn caused the agent to lose the tail of the
         oplog.

   * - Inconsistent backup configuration has been detected
     - |mms| has detected that the configuration for a backup does not
       match the configuration of the MongoDB deployment it backs up.

       To resolve this alert, see :doc:`/reference/alerts/inconsistent-backup`.

   * - Inconsistent cluster snapshot count is...
     - |mms| fails a consecutive number of times to successfully take a
       cluster snapshot. This alert is triggered when the number of
       attempts meets your specified threshold.

       The alert text may contain the reason for the problem. Common
       problems include:

       - There was no reachable :binary:`~bin.mongos`.
         To resolve this issue, ensure that there is at least one
         :binary:`~bin.mongos` showing on the |mms|
         :guilabel:`Deployment` page.

       - :manual:`balancer </core/sharding-balancing>` could not be
         stopped. To resolve this issue, check the log files for the
         first :manual:`config server </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`
         to determine why the balancer will not stop.

       - Could not insert a token in one or more
         :manual:`shards </core/sharded-cluster-shards>`. To resolve
         this issue, ensure connectivity between the {+bagent+} and
         all shards.
