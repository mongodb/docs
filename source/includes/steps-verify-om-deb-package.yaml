    If the package is properly signed, but you don't currently trust the
    signing key in your local ``trustdb``, ``gpg`` also returns the
    following message:

    .. code-block:: sh
       :copyable: false

       gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
       gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
