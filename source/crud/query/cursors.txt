Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to access data from a **cursor** by using the
{+driver-short+}.

A cursor is a tool that returns the results of a read operation in iterable
batches. Because a cursor holds only a subset of documents at any given time,
cursors reduce both memory consumption and network bandwidth usage.

You can retrieve a cursor by using the ``FindSync()`` or ``FindAsync()`` method. You can
also convert the results of the ``Find()`` method to a cursor by chaining the ``ToCursor()``
or ``ToCursorAsync()`` method.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection
in the ``sample_restaurants`` database provided in the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`.
To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets,
see the :ref:`<csharp-get-started>` tutorial.

The examples on this page use the following ``Restaurant`` object to model the documents
in the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Cursor.cs
   :start-after: start-restaurant-class
   :end-before: end-restaurant-class
   :language: csharp

Access Cursor Contents Iteratively
----------------------------------

To iterate over the contents of a cursor, use a ``foreach`` loop inside a ``using`` block.
The following example retrieves documents from the ``restaurants`` collection in which the
value of the ``name`` field is ``"Starbucks"``, then iterates over the results.
Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding
code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Cursor.cs
         :start-after: start-cursor-iterate
         :end-before: end-cursor-iterate
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Cursor.cs
         :start-after: start-cursor-iterate-async
         :end-before: end-cursor-iterate-async
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:

The following example performs the same operation but uses the ``ToCursor()`` method.
Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous`
tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Cursor.cs
         :start-after: start-cursor-iterate-to-cursor
         :end-before: end-cursor-iterate-to-cursor
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Cursor.cs
         :start-after: start-cursor-iterate-to-cursor-async
         :end-before: end-cursor-iterate-to-cursor-async
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:

Retrieve All Documents
----------------------

.. warning::

   If the number and size of documents returned by your query exceeds available
   application memory, your program might crash. If you expect a large result
   set, :ref:`access your cursor iteratively <csharp-cursors-iterate>`.

To retrieve all documents from a cursor, use the ``ToList()`` method, as shown in the
following example. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous`
tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Cursor.cs
         :start-after: start-cursor-to-list
         :end-before: end-cursor-to-list
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Cursor.cs
         :start-after: start-cursor-to-list-async
         :end-before: end-cursor-to-list-async
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:

Tailable Cursors
----------------

When querying on a :manual:`capped collection </core/capped-collections/>`, you
can use a **tailable cursor** that remains open after the client exhausts the
results in a cursor. To create a tailable cursor, create a ``FindOptions`` object and set the
``CursorType`` property to ``CursorType.TailableAwait``. Then, pass the ``FindOptions`` object
to one of the find operation methods. The following example shows how to create a tailable
cursor on a capped collection. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or
:guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Cursor.cs
         :start-after: start-tailable-cursor
         :end-before: end-tailable-cursor
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/Cursor.cs
         :start-after: start-tailable-cursor-async
         :end-before: end-tailable-cursor-async
         :language: csharp
         :dedent:
