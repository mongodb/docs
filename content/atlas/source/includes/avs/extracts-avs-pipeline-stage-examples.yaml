  The following query uses the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage to search
  the ``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large`` field using vector embeddings
  for the string *time travel*. It considers up to ``150`` nearest
  neighbors, and returns ``10`` documents in the results. The query also
  specifies a :pipeline:`$project` stage to do the following:

  - Exclude the ``_id`` field and include only the ``plot`` and
    ``title`` fields in the results.
  - Add a field named ``score`` that shows the
    :ref:`vector search score <vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-score>` for
    each document in the results.

  The following query filters the documents for movies released between
  January 01, ``1955`` and January 01, ``1975`` before performing the
  semantic search against the sample vector data. It uses the
  :query:`$and` operator to perform a logical ``AND`` operation of the
  specified dates. It then searches the
  ``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large`` field in the filtered documents for
  ``150`` nearest neighbors using the vector embeddings for the string
  *kids adventure*, and returns ``10`` documents in the results. The
  query also specifies a :pipeline:`$project` stage to do the following:

  - Exclude the ``_id`` field and include only ``plot``, ``title``, 
    and ``year`` fields in the results.
  - Add a field named ``score`` that shows the vector search score
    of the documents in the results.

  {+avs+} filters the documents based on the ``year`` field value that
  ranges between 1955 and 1975. It returns documents that summarize
  children's adventures in the plot for movies released between 1955 and
  1975.

     pre-filters in semantic search queries against the embedded data in
     the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` collection.

  The following query uses the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage to search
  the ``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large`` field using vector embeddings
  for the string *world war*. It requests exact matches and limits the
  results to ``10`` documents only. The query also specifies a
  :pipeline:`$project` stage to do the following:

  - Exclude the ``_id`` field and include only the ``plot``, ``title``,
    and ``year`` fields in the results.
  - Add a field named ``score`` that shows the vector search score
    of the documents in the results.

  The following query uses the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage to search
  the ``fullplot`` field. The query automatically generates vector
  embeddings for the string *young heroes caught in epic struggles
  between light and darkness* using the same model that was used in the
  index to perform a semantic search. It considers up to ``100``
  nearest neighbors, and returns ``10`` documents in the results. The
  query also specifies a :pipeline:`$project` stage to do the following:

  - Exclude the ``_id`` field and include only the ``fullplot`` and
    ``title`` fields in the results.
  - Add a field named ``score`` that shows the
    :ref:`vector search score <vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-score>` for
    each document in the results.

  The following query uses the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage to search
  the ``fullplot`` field for movies. The query automatically generates
  vector embeddings for the string *epic fantasy journey with reluctant 
  heroes* using the ``voyage-4`` embedding model, which is the same model 
  that was used to index the ``fullplot`` field, to perform a semantic 
  search. The query specifies the following criteria to pre-filter the 
  documents for the semantic search:

  - Include only movies released between the years ``1980`` to ``2020``,
    both inclusive.
  - Include only movies in the genres ``Action``, ``Adventure``, and
    ``Family``.

  It considers up to ``100`` nearest neighbors, and returns ``10``
  documents in the results. The query also specifies a
  :pipeline:`$project` stage to do the following:

  - Exclude the ``_id`` field and include only the ``fullplot``,
    ``genres``, and ``title`` fields in the results.
  - Add a field named ``score`` that shows the
    :ref:`vector search score <vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-score>` for
    each document in the results.

  {+avs+} filters the documents based on the ``year`` field value that
  ranges between 1980 and 2020. It generated embeddings for the query 
  text using the ``voyage-4`` embedding model specified in the query and 
  considered up to ``100`` nearest neighbors before returning the top ten 
  results. It returns documents that summarize fantasy journey of a hero 
  in the plot for movies released between 1980 and 2020.
