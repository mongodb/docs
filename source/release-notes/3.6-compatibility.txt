General Compatibility Changes
-----------------------------

.. _3.6-compatibility-arbiter-priority:

Arbiter and Priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-arbiter-priority.rst

.. _aggregate-compatibility:

``aggregate`` Command and Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 removes the option for the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command
to return its results as a single document.

If you run the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command, you must include either
the ``cursor`` option or the ``explain`` option.

Rather than run the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command directly, most users
should use the :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` helper provided in
the mongo shell or the equivalent helper in their driver. These helpers
return a cursor unless using the ``explain`` option.

Stricter Validation of ``$pop`` Arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 3.6 [#upgraded]_, :update:`$pop` operator performs
a stricter validation of its argument to require either:

- ``-1`` to remove the first element of an array, or

- ``1`` to remove the last element in an array.

In earlier versions, :update:`$pop` allowed:

- any value less than ``0`` to remove the first element of an array, and

- any value greater than or equal to ``0`` as well as non-numeric value
  to remove the last element in an array.

.. [#upgraded]

   Affects MongoDB deployments with ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set
   to ``3.6``; e.g. new 3.6 deployments, upgraded deployments that have
   set ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` to ``3.6``.

.. _3.6-pushall-compatibility:

Remove ``$pushAll`` Update Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 removes the deprecated ``$pushAll`` operator. The operator
has been deprecated since 2.4.

Instead of ``$pushAll``, use the :update:`$push` operator with the
:update:`$each` modifier. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.update(
      { name: "joe" },
      { $push: { scores: { $each: [ 90, 92, 85 ] } } }
   )

Remove Diagnostic Logging Command and Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.6 removes the deprecated :dbcommand:`diagLogging` command and
:program:`mongod` ``--diaglog`` option. Instead, use
:program:`mongoreplay` to capture, replay, and profile commands sent to
your MongoDB deployment.

.. _3.6-validate-compatibility:

``validate`` Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-validate-wiredtiger-full-option.rst

For more information on the validate operation, see the
:dbcommand:`validate` command and the
:method:`db.collection.validate()` method.

.. _3.6-type-array-compatibility:

``$type: "array"`` Behavior Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 3.6, :query:`$type: "array" <$type>` and :query:`$type: 4
<$type>` expressions match array fields that contain any element type.

In earlier versions, ``$type : "array"`` only matches array fields that
contain nested arrays.

For example, a collection named ``c`` contains two documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": 1, "a": [ 1, 2, 3 ] },
   { "_id": 2, "a": [ 1, 2, [ 3, 4 ] ] }

The following operation queries by type on field ``a``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.c.find( { "a": { $type : "array" } } )

Starting in 3.6, the query returns both documents in the collection
because the ``$type`` query can now detect that field ``a`` is itself
an array.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": 1, "a": [ 1, 2, 3 ] },
   { "_id": 2, "a": [ 1, 2, [ 3, 4 ] ] }

In 3.4 and earlier versions of MongoDB, the query only returns those
documents in which the array field ``a`` contains an element of
:term:`BSON` type ``array``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": 2, "a": [ 1, 2, [ 3, 4 ] ] }

If upgrading from a MongoDB 3.4.x  deployment that has partial indexes whose
``partialFilterExpression`` includes a ``$type : "array"`` or ``$type : 4``
expression, you must rebuild these indexes after upgrading to avoid conflicting
``$type : 'array'`` semantics.

For more information on the ``$type: "array"`` expression, see
:ref:`document-querying-by-array-type`.

.. _3.6-sort-behavior-compatibility:

Array Sort Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 3.6, when sorting a field containing an array, MongoDB
orders the field with the lowest-valued element of the array first for
ascending sorts and the highest-valued element of the array first for
descending sorts. A sort no longer takes the query predicate into
account when choosing the array element which will act as the
**sort key**. This behavior change applies to both the
:doc:`find </reference/command/find/>` command and the 
:doc:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>`.

As a result of this change, applications that currently sort by an
array field may experience a different sort order.

.. note ::

   As of version 3.6, the query engine cannot use a
   :doc:`multikey index </core/index-multikey/>` to provide a
   non-blocking sort by an array field. If you try to sort in this
   manner, the query plan will include a blocking SORT stage, which
   may negatively impact performance.

.. _3.6-find-method-sort:

``find`` Method Sorting
```````````````````````
A **sort key** is the array element MongoDB uses during the sorting
process to compare and ultimately order documents containing an array.
In an ascending sort, documents containing arrays with the
lowest-valued sort keys are ordered first. Likewise, in a descending
sort, documents containing arrays with the highest-valued sort keys are
ordered first.

In MongoDB 3.4 and earlier, a sort by an array field took into account
the query predicate when determining the sort key.

For example, a collection ``coll`` has the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 0, a: [-3, -2, 2, 3] }
   { _id: 1, a: [ 5, -4 ] }

Consider following sort operation on the array field ``a`` of the
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.coll.find({a: {$gte: 0}}).sort({a: 1});

In MongoDB 3.6, the sort operation no longer takes into account the
query predicate when determining its sort key. As a result, the sort
key is the lowest-valued element for each document:

- ``-3`` for the document with ``_id: 0`` and
- ``-4`` for the document with ``_id: 1``.

The operation returns the documents in the following order:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "a" : [ 5, -4 ] }
   { "_id" : 0, "a" : [ -3, -2, 2, 3 ] }

Previous MongoDB versions use the lowest-valued array element that
matches the query predicate of ``{$gte: 0}`` as the sort key:

- ``2`` for the document with ``_id: 0`` and
- ``5`` for the document with ``_id: 1``,

and would return the documents in the following order:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 0, a: [-3, -2, 2, 3] }
   { _id: 1, a: [ 5, -4 ] }

.. _3.6-agg-method-sort:

``aggregate`` Method Sorting
````````````````````````````

In MongoDB 3.6, when sorting array fields with the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method, only a single array element
is used as the sort key.

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // Documents.
   { "_id" : 1, "timestamps" : [ ISODate("2017-07-15T15:31:01Z"), ISODate("2017-07-21T18:31:01Z") ] }
   { "_id" : 0, "timestamps" : [ ISODate("2017-07-21T15:31:01Z"), ISODate("2017-07-21T13:31:01Z") ] }

   // Query.
   db.c.aggregate([{$sort: {timestamps: -1}}])

For a descending sort, the most recent time in the array is used as the
sort key: ``3:31 PM on July 21`` for the document with ``_id: 0`` and
``5:31 PM on July 21`` for the document with ``_id: 1``. Since the sort
is descending, these keys are then ordered from most recent to least
recent, resulting in the document with ``_id: 1`` sorting before the
document with ``_id: 0``.

Before 3.6, the *entire array* is used as the sort
key for aggregation sorts. The array sort keys are compared
element-wise to determine the sort order of the result set. 

.. example::

   .. code-block:: javascript

      // Documents.
      {_id: 0, a: [3, 1, 5]}
      {_id: 1, a: [3, 4, 0]}
   
      // Query.
      db.coll.aggregate([{$sort: {a: 1}}])      

Prior to 3.6, the sort keys are [3, 1, 5] and [3, 4, 0] respectively.
Since the first array elements are equal, the second array element
breaks the tie and the document with ``_id: 0`` sorts first.

For more information on sorting with the
:doc:`Aggregation Pipeline </reference/operator/aggregation/>`, see
:doc:`$sort </reference/operator/aggregation/sort/>`.

Aggregation Date to String Coercion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 3.6, a date coerced to a string in an aggregation expression will
include milliseconds and is appended with the letter 'Z'.

.. example::

   .. code-block:: javascript

      // Documents.
      {_id: 0, d: ISODate("2017-10-18T20:04:27.978Z")}
      {_id: 1, d: ISODate("2017-10-18T20:04:28.192Z")}

      // Query.
      db.coll.aggregate({$project: {d: {$toLower: "$d"}}})

Prior to 3.6, this would return the dates as ``d: "2017-10-18t20:04:27"`` and
``d: "2017-10-18t20:04:28"`` respectively. In 3.6, the results include the
milliseconds and letter 'Z': ``d: "2017-10-18t20:04:27.978z"`` and ``d:
"2017-10-18t20:04:28.192z"``.

The change applies to the following aggregation operators:

- :expression:`$concat`

- :expression:`$substr`

- :expression:`$substrBytes`

- :expression:`$substrCP`

- :expression:`$strcasecmp`

- :expression:`$toLower`

- :expression:`$toUpper`

Update Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Fields in Updates
`````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, new fields added through :dbcommand:`update`
operations are appended in lexicographic order.

For example, a collection ``coll`` has the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 0, x: 0 }

The following update operation adds two new fields to the document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.coll.update({_id: 0}, {$set: {b: 0, a: 0}})

Starting in 3.6, MongoDB appends the new fields in lexicographic order. The
updated document would be ``{_id : 0, x: 0, a: 0, b: 0}``.

Earlier versions of MongoDB append the new fields in order of appearance in
the update document. The updated document would be ``{_id : 0, x: 0, b: 0, a:
0}``.

Fields Conflicting with ``arrayFilters`` Identifiers
````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, fields that conflict with ``arrayFilters``
identifiers can no longer be updated.

For example, a collection ``coll`` has the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 0, x: { "$[]": 0 } }

The following update succeeds in earlier versions of MongoDB:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.coll.update({_id: 0}, {$set: {"x.$[]": 1}})

In MongoDB 3.6 the update fails since the field name "$[]" conflicts with
``arrayFilters`` identifier syntax. For more information on
``arrayFilters`` see :ref:`update-command-arrayFilters`.

.. note::

   The new update behaviors apply only when ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` is
   set to 3.6.


.. _3.6-index-asterisk:

Indexes Named ``*``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 3.6, you cannot specify ``*`` as the index name during
index creation nor can you delete indexes named ``*`` by specifying the
index keys.

To delete existing indexes named ``*``, delete the index before
upgrading. To rename them, delete and recreate the index.

Platform Support
----------------

MongoDB 3.6 discontinues support for versions of Windows prior to Windows
Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7.
