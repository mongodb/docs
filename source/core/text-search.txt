Overview
--------

Text search supports the search of string content in documents of a
collection. Text search introduces a new :ref:`text
<index-feature-text>` index type and a new :dbcommand:`text` command.

The text search process:

- tokenizes and stems the search term(s) during both the index creation
  and the text command execution.

- assigns a score to each document that contains the search term in the
  indexed fields. The score determines the relevance of a document to a
  given search query.

By default, :dbcommand:`text` command returns at most the top 100
matching documents as determined by the scores.

.. important::

   Before you can create a text index or :ref:`run the text command
   <text-search-text-command>`, you need to manually enable the text
   search. See :doc:`/tutorial/enable-text-search` for information on
   how to enable the text search feature.

.. _text-search-storage-requirements:

Storage Requirements and Performance Costs
------------------------------------------

``text`` indexes have the following storage requirements and
performance costs:

- ``text`` indexes change the space allocation method for all future
  record allocations in a collection to :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes`.

- ``text`` indexes can be large. They contain one index entry for each
  unique post-stemmed word in each indexed field for each document
  inserted.

- Building a ``text`` index is very similar to building a large
  multi-key index and will take longer than building a simple ordered
  (scalar) index on the same data.

- When building a large ``text`` index on an existing collection,
  ensure that you have a sufficiently high limit on open file
  descriptors. See the :ref:`recommended settings <oom-killer>`.

- ``text`` indexes will impact insertion throughput because MongoDB
  must add an index entry for each unique post-stemmed word in each
  indexed field of each new source document.

- Additionally, ``text`` indexes do not store phrases or information
  about the proximity of words in the documents. As a result, phrase
  queries will run much more effectively when the entire collection
  fits in RAM.

.. _create-text-index:

Create a ``text`` Index
-----------------------

To perform text search, create a ``text`` index on the field or fields
whose value is a string or an array of string elements. To create a
``text`` index, use the :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()` method
with a document that contains field and value pairs where the value is
the string literal ``text``.

   - Text indexes have significant storage requirements and performance
     costs. See :ref:`text-search-storage-requirements` for more
     information.

.. _text-search-text-command:

``text`` Command
----------------

The :dbcommand:`text` command can search for words and phrases. The
command matches on the complete stemmed words. For example, if a
document field contains the word ``blueberry``, a search on the term
``blue`` will not match the document. However, a search on either
``blueberry`` or ``blueberries`` will match.

For information and examples on various text search patterns, see
:doc:`/tutorial/search-for-text`.

Text Search Output
------------------

The :dbcommand:`text` command returns a document that contains the
result set.

See :ref:`text-search-output` for information on the output.
