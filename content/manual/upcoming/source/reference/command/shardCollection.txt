Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: shardCollection

   :ref:`Shards <sharding-background>` a collection to distribute its documents across
   shards. The :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command must be run against the
   ``admin`` database.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`sh.shardCollection` 
      helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

                
Syntax
------

.. |command| replace:: :dbcommand:`shardCollection`

.. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand.rst

The command has the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   db.adminCommand(
      {
        shardCollection: "<database>.<collection>",
        key: { <field1>: <1|"hashed">, ... },
        unique: <boolean>,
        presplitHashedZones: <boolean>,
        collation: { locale: "simple" },
        timeseries: <object>
      }
    )

.. note::

   .. versionchanged:: 6.0

   Starting in MongoDB 6.0, sharding a collection does **not** require you to
   first run the :dbcommand:`enableSharding` command to configure the database.

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80
 
   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
 
   * - ``shardCollection``
     - string
     - The :term:`namespace` of the collection to shard in the form
       ``<database>.<collection>``.
 
   * - ``key``
     - document
     - The document that specifies the field or fields to use as the
       :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>`.
 
       ``{ <field1>: <1|"hashed">, ... }``
 
       Set the field values to either:
       
       - ``1`` for :ref:`range-based sharding <sharding-ranged>`
       
       - ``"hashed"`` to specify a
         :ref:`hashed shard key <hashed-shard-keys>`.
       
       :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>` must be
       supported by an index. Unless the collection is empty, the
       index must exist prior to the :dbcommand:`shardCollection`
       command. If the collection is empty, MongoDB creates the
       index prior to sharding the collection if the index that can
       support the shard key does not already exist.
       
       See also :ref:`sharding-shard-key-indexes`
 
   * - ``unique``
     - boolean
     - Specify ``true`` to ensure that the underlying index
       enforces a unique constraint. Defaults to ``false``. 
 
       You cannot specify ``true`` when using :ref:`hashed shard keys 
       <sharding-hashed>`.

   * - ``collation``
     - document
     - Optional. If the collection specified to ``shardCollection``
       has a default :ref:`collation <collation>`, you *must* include a 
       collation document with ``{ locale : "simple" }``, or the 
       ``shardCollection`` command fails. At least one of the indexes
       whose fields support the shard key pattern must have the simple
       collation.
       
   * - :ref:`presplitHashedZones 
       <cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>`
     - boolean
     - .. _cmd-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones:
     
       Optional. Specify ``true`` to perform initial chunk creation
       and distribution for an empty or non-existing collection based
       on the defined zones and zone ranges for the collection. For
       :ref:`hashed sharding <sharding-hashed>` only.
 
       ``shardCollection`` with ``presplitHashedZones: true`` returns
       an error if any of the following are true:
 
       - The shard key does not contain a hashed field 
         (i.e. is not a :ref:`single field hashed index 
         <index-hashed-index>` or :ref:`compound hashed index
         <index-type-compound-hashed>`).
 
       - The collection has no defined zones or zone ranges.
 
       - The defined zone range or ranges do not meet the 
         :ref:`requirements 
         <shardCollection-zones>`.

   * - :ref:`timeseries <cmd-shard-collection-timeseries>`
     - object
     - .. _cmd-shard-collection-timeseries:
 
       .. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-timeseries-param-desc.rst
       
       For detailed syntax, see
       :ref:`cmd-sharded-time-series-collection-options`.
 
       .. versionadded:: 5.1
 
.. _cmd-sharded-time-series-collection-options:

Time Series Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 5.1

To create a new :ref:`time series collection
<manual-timeseries-collection>` that is sharded, specify the
:ref:`timeseries <cmd-shard-collection-timeseries>` option to
:dbcommand:`shardCollection`.

The :ref:`timeseries <cmd-shard-collection-timeseries>` option takes
the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``timeField``
     - string
     - .. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-time-field-description.rst

       :red:`WARNING:` Starting in MongoDB 8.0, use of the ``timeField`` as a
       shard key in a time series collection is deprecated.

   * - ``metaField``
     - string
     - .. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-meta-field-description.rst

   * - ``granularity``
     - string
     - .. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-granularity-description.rst

Considerations
--------------

Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~

While you can :ref:`change your shard key <change-a-shard-key>`
later, it is important to carefully consider your shard key choice to
avoid scalability and perfomance issues.

.. _hashed-shard-keys:

Hashed Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Hashed shard keys <sharding-hashed-sharding>` use a
:ref:`hashed index <index-type-hashed>` or a
:ref:`compound hashed index <index-type-compound-hashed>`
as the shard key.

Use the form ``field: "hashed"`` to specify a hashed shard key field.

Example
-------

The following operation enables sharding for the ``people`` collection
in the ``records`` database and uses the ``zipcode`` field as the
:ref:`shard key <shard-key>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { shardCollection: "records.people", key: { zipcode: 1 } } )
