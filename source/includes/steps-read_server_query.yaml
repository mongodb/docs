  .. tip:: 
     
     If you have already :doc:`imported data into your database
     </server/import>` using :program:`mongoimport`, you can skip
     this step.

  Before you can write queries to extract data in a meaningful way, you'll need
  to add more data to your database. You can do that by running the ``insertMany()``
  nethod:

  You can retrieve specific documents from a collection by applying
  filter criteria.

  To specify filter criteria, pass a JSON document containing the
  criteria you are searching for to the ``find`` method.

  The following example illustrate using a status of "D" as criteria
  for narrowing a find on a collection.

  If you have loaded data into your test database, you will see one or
  more JSON documents returned. Note that all records return have a status of "D".
