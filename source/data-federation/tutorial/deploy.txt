This part of the tutorial guides you through deploying a {+fdi+} using the following quickstart wizards in the {+atlas-ui+}: 

- The :ref:`Feed Downstream Systems <feed-downstream-systems>` wizard
  helps you set up a {+fdi+} that exports data from your |service|
  {+cluster+}, transforms the data into `Parquet
  <https://parquet.apache.org/docs/>`__, :ref:`CSV <adf-csv-tsv-data>`,
  |bson|, or :manual:`MongoDB Extended JSON
  </reference/mongodb-extended-json/>`, and copies the data to your
  |aws| |s3| buckets at specified intervals using :ref:`Atlas Triggers
  <triggers>`. 

- The :ref:`Explore with Sample Data <explore-sample-data>` wizard helps
  you set up a {+fdi+} loaded with sample data to demonstrate  how to
  connect to the {+fdi+} and run queries. 

- The :ref:`Query Data Across Clusters <query-across-clusters>` wizard
  helps you set up a {+fdi+} that accesses data from multiple |service|
  {+cluster+}\s so you can run federated queries across collections from
  all of them. 

To learn more about the storage configuration options, see :ref:`config-adf`.

Prerequisites 
-------------

To complete this part of the tutorial, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Create a `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_atlas>`__ account, if you don't have one already.

- For the Feed Downstream Systems wizard, you need:

  - The `AWS CLI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html>`__, `configured to access your AWS account <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-quick-configuration>`__. Alternatively, you must have access to the |aws| Management Console with permission to create `IAM roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html>`__.

  - An |s3| bucket to store extracted data.
        
  - At least one |service| {+cluster+} with a database.

- For the Query Data Across {+Clusters+} wizard, you need:
  
  - At least one |service| {+cluster+} deployed in the same project you'll use for your {+fdi+}.
   
  - At least one database collection. You can :ref:`load sample data <sample-data>` if you don't have collections already.

.. _feed-downstream-systems:

Use the Feed Downstream Systems Wizard 
--------------------------------------

The Feed Downstream Systems wizard helps you set up a {+fdi+} that writes data from your |service| {+cluster+} to your |aws| |s3| bucket continuously on a schedule.

.. include:: /includes/steps/adf-deploy-gst.rst

.. _explore-sample-data:

Use the Explore with Sample Data Wizard 
---------------------------------------

The Explore with Sample Data wizard helps you set up a {+fdi+} loaded with sample data.

.. include:: /includes/steps/adf-deploy-sample-data.rst


This {+fdi+} includes the following sample datasets that you can use to practice
:ref:`running queries <gst-run-queries>`: 

- ``/airbnb/listingsAndReviews/{bedrooms int}/{review_scores.review_scores_rating int}/``

  This path references the ``airbnb`` dataset, which contains the 
  vacation home listing details and customer reviews. To learn more 
  about this dataset, see :atlas:`Sample AirBnB Listings Dataset 
  </sample-data/sample-airbnb>`.

  For this path, the {+fdi+} uses partitions optimized for queries on 
  the ``bedrooms`` field and ``review_scores.review_score_ratings`` 
  fields.

- ``/analytics/accounts/{limit int}/``

  This path references the ``analytics`` dataset, which contains data 
  for a typical financial services application. To learn more about 
  this dataset, see :atlas:`Sample Analytics Dataset 
  </sample-data/sample-analytics#sample_analytics.accounts>`.

  For this path, the {+fdi+} uses partitions optimized for queries on 
  the ``limit`` field.

- ``/analytics/customers/{birthdate isodate}/``

  This data references the ``analytics`` dataset, which contains 
  collections for a typical financial services application. To learn 
  more about this dataset, see :atlas:`Sample Analytics Dataset 
  </sample-data/sample-analytics#sample_analytics.customers>`.

  For this path, the {+fdi+} uses partitions optimized for queries on 
  the ``birthdate`` field.

- ``/analytics/transactions/{account_id int}/``

  This path references the ``analytics`` dataset, which contains 
  data for a typical finanacial services application. To learn more 
  about this dataset, see :atlas:`Sample Analytics Dataset 
  </sample-data/sample-analytics#sample_analytics.transactions>`.

  For this path, the {+fdi+} uses partitions optimized for queries on 
  the ``account_id`` field.

- ``/mflix/movies/{type string}/{year int}/``

  This path references the ``mflix`` dataset, which contains data on 
  movies and movie theaters. To learn more about this dataset, see 
  :atlas:`Sample Mflix Dataset </sample-data/sample-mflix#sample_mflix.movies>`.

  For this path, the {+fdi+} uses partitions optimized for queries on 
  the ``type`` and ``year`` fields.

- ``/mflix/sessions.json``
  
  This path references the ``mflix`` dataset, which contains data on 
  movies and movie theaters. To learn more about this dataset, see 
  :atlas:`Sample Mflix Dataset </sample-data/sample-mflix#sample_mflix.sessions>`.

  This path does not contain any partition attributes and so, for 
  queries against data in the collection, {+df+} searches all the 
  files in the collection.

- ``/mflix/theaters/{theaterId string}/{location.address.zipcode string}/``

  This path references the ``mflix`` dataset, which contains data on 
  movies and movie theaters. To learn more about this dataset, see 
  :atlas:`Sample Mflix Dataset </sample-data/sample-mflix#sample_mflix.theaters>`.

  For this path, the {+fdi+} uses partitions optimized for queries on 
  the ``theaterId`` and ``location.address.zipcode`` fields.

- ``/mflix/users.json``

  This path references the ``mflix`` collection, which contains data 
  on movies and movie theaters. To learn more about this dataset, see 
  :atlas:`Sample Mflix Dataset 
  </sample-data/sample-mflix#sample_mflix.users>`.

  This path does not contain any partition attributes and so, for  
  queries against data in the collection, the {+fdi+} searches all the 
  files in the collection.

- ``/nyc-yellow-cab-trips/{trip_start_isodate isodate}/{passenger_count int}/{fare_type string}/``

  This path references the ``nyc-yellow-cab-trips`` dataset, which 
  contains data on the trips, including trip date, fare, and number 
  of passengers. 

  For this path, the {+fdi+} uses partitions optimized for queries on 
  the ``trip_start_isodate``, ``passenger_count``, and ``fare_type`` 
  fields.

.. _query-across-clusters:

Use the Query Data Across {+Clusters+} Wizard 
---------------------------------------------

The Query Data Across {+Clusters+} wizard helps you set up a {+fdi+} that accesses data from multiple |service| {+clusters+}.

.. include:: /includes/steps/adf-deploy-across-clusters.rst

Next Steps
----------

Now that your {+fdi+} is deployed, proceed to :ref:`config-connection`.
