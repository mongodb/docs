Generate a visualization of your data model as an |erd| in 
|compass-short|. Entity-relationship diagrams can help you understand and 
document the relationships between data in your database and plan 
changes to your schema.

About this Task 
---------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-data-model-sampling.rst

If you make any changes to your schema after you generate a diagram, 
|compass-short| does not automatically update the diagram. You must create a new 
diagram to see your changes.

Before You Begin
----------------

To generate an |erd| in |compass-short|, your database 
must have at least one collection with data. 

Steps
-----

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Open the Data Modeling tab 

      In the left sidebar, click :icon-lg:`Diagram` :guilabel:`Data Modeling`.

   .. step:: Click Generate diagram

      If you have existing diagrams saved in the :guilabel:`Data Modeling` tab, 
      you can create a new diagram by clicking :icon-lg:`Plus` 
      :guilabel:`Generate new diagram` in the upper-right corner of the screen.

   .. step:: Name your diagram

   .. step:: Select your MongoDB connection

      Use the drop-down menu to select which MongoDB connection to use to 
      generate your diagram. The :guilabel:`Active` label appears under any 
      currently active connection name.

   .. step:: Select your database 

      Use the drop-down menu to select which database to use for your data model 
      diagram.

   .. step:: Select collections 

      Use the checkboxes to select which collections to include in your data 
      model diagram.

   .. step:: (Optional) Toggle automatically inferred relationships

      In the :guilabel:` Select collections` modal, you can choose to 
      :guilabel:`Automatically infer relationships` between collections. When 
      enabled, |compass-short| analyzes the selected collections and adds 
      relationships based on indexed fields that contain references to other 
      collections.

      You can also :ref:`manually add and edit relationships 
      <compass-data-modeling-relationships>` after you generate your diagram.

      .. note:: 

         .. include:: /includes/shared/fact-dm-annotation.rst

   .. step:: Click Generate 

      |compass-short| generates an |erd| with the selected 
      collections and displays it in the current tab.
      
      After you generate a diagram, |compass-short| displays the existing 
      diagrams in the :guilabel:`Data Modeling` tab.
