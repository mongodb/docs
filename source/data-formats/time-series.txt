Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+driver-short+} to store
and interact with **time series data**.

Time series data is composed of the following components:

- Measured quantity
- Timestamp for the measurement
- Metadata that describes the measurement

The following table describes sample situations for which you could store time
series data:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33, 33, 33
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Situation
     - Measured Quantity
     - Metadata

   * - Recording monthly sales by industry
     - Revenue in USD
     - Company, country

   * - Tracking weather changes
     - Precipitation level
     - Location, sensor type

   * - Recording fluctuations in housing prices
     - Monthly rent price
     - Location, currency

.. _pymongo-time-series-create:

Create a Time Series Collection
-------------------------------

.. important:: Server Version for Time Series Collections

   To create and interact with time series collections, you must be
   connected to a deployment running {+mdb-server+} 5.0 or later.

To create a time series collection, pass the following arguments to the 
``create_collection()`` method:

- Name of the new collection to create
- ``timeseries`` argument 

The ``timeseries`` argument is of type ``dict``. It contains the following fields:

- ``timeField``: Specifies the field that stores a timestamp in each time series
  document.
- ``metaField``: Specifies the field that stores metadata in each time series 
  document.
- ``granularity``: Specifies the approximate time between consecutive timestamps.
  The possible values are ``'seconds'``, ``'minutes'``, and ``'hours'``.
- ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds``: Sets the maximum time between timestamps in the 
  same bucket.
- ``bucketRoundingSeconds``: Sets the number of seconds to round down by when 
  MongoDB sets the minimum timestamp for a new bucket. Must be equal to 
  ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds``.

See :manual:`Command Fields </reference/command/create/#command-fields>`
to learn more about these fields.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example creates a time series collection named ``october2024`` with the
``timeField`` option set to ``"timestamp"``. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous`
or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. code-block:: python

          database = client.get_database("weather")

          time_series_options = {
              "timeField": "timestamp"
          }

          database.create_collection("october2024", timeseries=time_series_options)

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. code-block:: python

          database = client.get_database("weather")

          time_series_options = {
              "timeField": "timestamp"
          }

          await database.create_collection("october2024", timeseries=time_series_options)


To check if you successfully created the collection, you can get a list of all
collections in your database and filter by collection name. Select the
:guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. io-code-block::
          :copyable: true

          .. input::
              :language: python
              
              print(list(database.list_collections(filter={'name': 'october2024'})))

          .. output::
              :language: json
              :visible: false

              {
                  "name": "october2024", 
                  "type": "timeseries", 
                  "options": {
                      "timeseries":   {
                          "timeField": "timestamp",
                          "granularity": "seconds", 
                          "bucketMaxSpanSeconds": 3600
                      }
                  }, 
                  "info": {
                      "readOnly": False
                  }
              }

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. io-code-block::
          :copyable: true

          .. input::
              :language: python
              
              collections = await database.list_collections(filter={'name': 'october2024'})
              print(await collections.to_list())

          .. output::
              :language: json
              :visible: false

              {
                  "name": "october2024", 
                  "type": "timeseries", 
                  "options": {
                      "timeseries":   {
                          "timeField": "timestamp",
                          "granularity": "seconds", 
                          "bucketMaxSpanSeconds": 3600
                      }
                  }, 
                  "info": {
                      "readOnly": False
                  }
              }

.. _pymongo-time-series-write:

Store Time Series Data
----------------------

You can insert data into a time series collection by using the ``insert_one()``
or ``insert_many()`` methods and specifying the measurement, timestamp, and 
metadata in each inserted document.

To learn more about inserting documents, see :ref:`pymongo-write-insert`.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example inserts New York City temperature data into the ``october2024``
time series collection created in :ref:`pymongo-time-series-create`. Each
document contains the following fields:

- ``temperature``, which stores temperature measurements in degrees Fahrenheit
- ``location``, which stores location metadata
- ``timestamp``, which stores the measurement timestamp

Select the
:guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. code-block:: python

          from datetime import datetime

          collection = database["october2024"]

          document_list = [
              { "temperature": 77, "location": "New York City", "timestamp": datetime(2024, 10, 22, 6, 0, 0) },
              { "temperature": 74, "location": "New York City", "timestamp": datetime(2024, 10, 23, 6, 0, 0) }
          ]

          collection.insert_many(document_list)

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async

      .. code-block:: python

          from datetime import datetime

          collection = database["october2024"]

          document_list = [
              { "temperature": 77, "location": "New York City", "timestamp": datetime(2024, 10, 22, 6, 0, 0) },
              { "temperature": 74, "location": "New York City", "timestamp": datetime(2024, 10, 23, 6, 0, 0) }
          ]

          await collection.insert_many(document_list)

.. _pymongo-time-series-read:

Query Time Series Data
----------------------

You can use the same syntax and conventions to query data stored in a time 
series collection as you use when performing read or aggregation operations on 
other collections. To learn more about these operations, see :ref:`pymongo-read`
and :ref:`pymongo-aggregation`.
