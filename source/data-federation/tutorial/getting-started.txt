Overview
--------

{+adf+} is MongoDB's solution for querying data stored in low cost |s3| 
buckets, |service| clusters, |http| stores, and {+adl+} datasets using 
the MongoDB Query Language. This allows applications to store data in 
the appropriate storage solution for its use-case.

This tutorial guides you through the process of creating and connecting 
to a sample {+fdi+} in |service|, configuring paths to collections for 
files stored in S3, and running MongoDB Query Language (MQL) operations.
