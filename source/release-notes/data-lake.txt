.. note:: Release notes mention only releases with feature changes

   MongoDB releases {+adl+} every two weeks, continuously improving
   {+adl+} performance and stability. These release notes capture only
   those releases that contain feature changes. If a particular {+adl+}
   release contains only performance and stability improvements, it is not
   included in these release notes. To identify which release version you
   are using, check the release version string for the release date.
