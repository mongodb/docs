action:
  - pre: |
      The balancer will not activate in the ``stopped`` state.
      To ensure that the  balancer
      is not ``stopped``, use :method:`sh.setBalancerState()`,
      as in the following:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sh.setBalancerState( true )
    post: |
      The balancer will not start if you are outside
      of the ``activeWindow`` timeframe.

action:
  - pre: |
      Set the ``activeWindow`` using :method:`~db.collection.update()`,
      as in the following:
    language: sh
    code: |
      db.settings.update(
         { _id: "balancer" },
         { $set: { activeWindow : { start : "<start-time>", stop : "<stop-time>" } } },
         { upsert: true }
      )
    post: |
      Replace ``<start-time>`` and ``<end-time>`` with time values using
      two digit hour and minute values (i.e. ``HH:MM``) that specify the
      beginning and end boundaries of the balancing window.

      - For ``HH`` values, use hour values ranging from ``00`` - ``23``.
      - For ``MM`` value, use minute values ranging from ``00`` - ``59``.

      MongoDB evaluates the start and stop times relative to the time
      zone of the member which is serving as a primary in the config
      server replica set.

      .. note::
        The balancer window must be sufficient to *complete* the migration
        of all data inserted during the day.

        As data insert rates can change based on activity and usage
        patterns, it is important to ensure that the balancing window you
        select will be sufficient to support the needs of your deployment.

        Do not use the :method:`sh.startBalancer()` method when you have set an
        ``activeWindow``.
