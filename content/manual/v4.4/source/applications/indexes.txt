The best indexes for your application must take a number
of factors into account, including the kinds of queries you expect,
the ratio of reads to writes, and the amount of free memory on your
system.

When developing your indexing strategy you should have a deep
understanding of your application's queries. Before you build indexes,
map out the types of queries you will run so that you can build
indexes that reference those fields. Indexes come with a performance
cost, but are more than worth the cost for frequent queries on large
data sets. Consider the relative frequency of each query in the
application and whether the query justifies an index.

The best overall strategy for designing indexes is to profile a
variety of index configurations with data sets similar to the ones
you'll be running in production to see which configurations perform
best. Inspect the current indexes created for your collections to
ensure they are supporting your current and planned queries. If an
index is no longer used, drop the index.

Generally, MongoDB only uses *one* index to fulfill most queries.
However, each clause of an :query:`$or` query may use a different
index, and in addition, MongoDB can use an :doc:`intersection
</core/index-intersection>` of multiple indexes.

The following documents introduce indexing strategies:

:ref:`Use the ESR (Equality, Sort, Range) Rule <esr-indexing-rule>`
   The ESR (Equality, Sort, Range) Rule is a guide to creating indexes
   that support your queries efficiently.

:ref:`create-indexes-to-support-queries`
   An index supports a query when the index contains all the fields
   scanned by the query. Creating indexes that support queries
   results in greatly increased query performance.

:ref:`sorting-with-indexes`
   To support efficient queries, use the strategies here when you
   specify the sequential order and sort order of index fields.

:ref:`indexes-ensure-indexes-fit-ram`
   When your index fits in RAM, the system can avoid reading the
   index from disk and you get the fastest processing.

:ref:`index-selectivity`
   Selectivity is the ability of a query to narrow results using the
   index. Selectivity allows MongoDB to use the index for a larger
   portion of the work associated with fulfilling the query.
