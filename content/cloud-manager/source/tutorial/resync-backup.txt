   :description: Resync a backup in Cloud Manager when it becomes out of sync with the MongoDB deployment to ensure data integrity.

.. note::

   You don't need to resync MongoDB databases that run with
   |fcv-link| 4.2 or later.

When a backup becomes out of sync with the MongoDB deployment, |mms|
produces a ``Backup requires a resync`` alert. If you
receive this alert, you must resync the backup for the specified
MongoDB instance.

The following scenarios trigger a ``Backup requires a resync`` alert:

The Oplog has rolled over
  This is the most common case for the
  ``Backup requires a resync`` alert. It occurs whenever
  the {+bagent+}'s :term:`tailing cursor <tailable cursor>`
  cannot keep up with the deployment's :manual:`oplog </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>`. This is similar
  to when a :manual:`secondary </reference/glossary/#std-term-secondary>` falls too far behind the primary in a
  replica set. Without a resync, the backups will not catch up.

Unsafe applyOps
  This occurs when a document that Backup does not have a copy of is
  indicated.

Data corruption or other illegal instruction
  This typically causes replication, and therefore the backup job, to
  break. When the daemon sees the broken job, it requests a resync.

During the resync, data is read from a secondary in each replica set
and |mms| does not produce any new snapshots.

.. note::

   For production deployments with |fcv-link| 4.0 or earlier, you 
   should resync all backups annually.

.. important::

   |mms| does not attempt to automatically recover from conditions that
   caused the ``Backup requires a resync`` alert. This
   alert means there is not enough data to complete a restore. There is
   no way to automatically recover from not having enough data from the
   snapshots and the oplog. Resyncing the backup is the best option.

Considerations
--------------

As of FCV 4.2, deployments are backed up with WiredTiger checkpoints
using :manual:`backup cursors 
</reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-cursor>`. Applications can 
continue read and write operations on the database while WiredTiger
takes the snapshot.

For production deployments with |fcv-link| 4.0 or earlier, to 
avoid the need for resyncs, ensure the Backup oplog does not fall
behind the deployment's oplog. This requires that:

- Adequate machine resources are provisioned for the agent.

- You restart the |mms| agents in a timely manner following maintenance
  or other downtime.

To provide a buffer for maintenance and for occasional activity bursts,
ensure that the oplog on the :manual:`primary </reference/glossary/#std-term-primary>` is large enough to contain
at least 24 hours of activity.

You should resync the head database after you
:ref:`create an index in a rolling fashion <data-explorer-indexes>` to
ensure that the head database takes the new index into account.
