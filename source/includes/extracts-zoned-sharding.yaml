## Summary emphasizes defining zones/ranges before sharding

ref: zoned-sharding-pre-define-zone
content: |

   By defining the zones and the zone ranges *before* sharding an empty
   or a non-existing collection, the shard collection operation creates
   chunks for the defined zone ranges as well as any additional chunks
   to cover the entire range of the shard key values and performs an
   initial chunk distribution based on the zone ranges. This initial
   creation and distribution of chunks allows for faster setup of zoned
   sharding. After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the
   chunk distribution going forward.

## Summary emphasizes sharding operation can distribute chunks

content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.0.3, the shard collection operation can
   perform an initial chunk creation and distribution for empty or
   non-existing collections if zones and the zone ranges have been
   defined for the collection. Initial creation and distribution of
   chunk allows for faster setup of zoned sharding. After the initial
   distribution, the balancer manages the chunk distribution going
   forward per usual.

   The shard collection operation (i.e. :dbcommand:`shardCollection`
   command and its helper :method:`sh.shardCollection()`) can perform
   initial chunk creation and distribution for an empty or a
   non-existing collection if zones and the zone ranges have been
   defined for the collection. Initial chunk distribution allows for a

   an unsharded collection or a non-existing collection.
