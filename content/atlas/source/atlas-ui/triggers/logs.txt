|service| keeps a log of Trigger, Function, and Change Stream events and
publishes notifications to your Atlas project's activity feed. |service| saves
logs for 10 days, after which they are deleted.

To learn how to view, filter, and analyze your application logs, see
:ref:`View Application Logs <view-logs>`.

Error Logs
----------

All log entries have one of the following statuses:

- ``OK``, which represents a normal event that succeeded without an error.
- ``Error``, which represents an event that did not run successfully for
  any reason.

For example, |service| logs an error for any of the following
events:

- You attempt to access data stored in Atlas for which there is no
  applicable rule.
- You throw or fail to handle an error or promise rejection in an Atlas
  Function.
- You call ``context.services.get()`` for a service which does not exist.

Log Filters
-----------

For performance reasons, |service| limits individual queries to a
maximum of 100 log entries per page. You can filter entries by type,
status, timestamp, user, and request ID to return only logs that are
relevant to your query.

Log Lines
---------

Functions can log information using JavaScript's ``console.log()``
method. |service| stringifies each console log and stores each string
as a single line. |service| truncates lines to 512 bytes in length.
For ASCII character sets, this translates to 512 characters; depending
on the character set you use, you may see truncation at lower character
counts.

|service| saves only the first 25 log lines for a given log entry.

Log Retention
-------------

|service| retains logs for 10 days, after which they are deleted.

If you require logs older than 10 days, you can automatically
:ref:`forward logs <triggers-forward-logs>` to another service. You
can also download a dump of currently available logs from the UI or use
the :admin-api-endpoint:`Admin API Logging endpoints <tag/logs>` to
fetch logs before they expire.

App Metrics
-----------

|service| measures usage and records aggregate metrics over time. You can access
and use the metrics to assess performance and identify usage trends. For
example, how much time was spent performing computations.

To learn more about which metrics are available and how to access them,
see :ref:`Metrics <app-services-metrics>`.

Atlas Alerts
------------

|service| events publish to your |service| project's activity feed.
Alerts include Trigger failure events, which occur when a Trigger fails and
cannot restart automatically.

To learn more, see :ref:`Activity Feed & Atlas Alerts <alerts>`.

Log Format
----------

Trigger log entries have the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   Logs:
   [
      <log line>,
      <log line>,
      ...
   ]

    See Function. See Trigger.

    Compute Used: <number> bytesâ€¢ms

Fields
------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 50

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - Compute Used
     - Computational load of the operation.

   * - Logs
     - List of ``console.log`` outputs. |service| saves the first 512 bytes
       of the last 25 ``console.log()`` calls.

   * - See Function. See Trigger.
     - Links to the Trigger that launched this event as well as the Function
       that was run by this event.

Error Fields
------------

Log entries created by unsuccessful operations may feature the following additional
fields for debugging purposes:
