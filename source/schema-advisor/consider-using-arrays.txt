Overview
--------

Arrays take advantage of MongoDB’s flexible document data 
model by grouping related data together. Using arrays in your documents 
can improve read performance compared to keeping related data across 
multiple collections because only one read operation is required to 
fetch that information.

If you don't use arrays in your schema, you may need to use 
:pipeline:`$lookup` operations to join related data together. 
``$lookup`` operations can be slow and resource-intensive 
because they need to read and perform logic on two collections instead 
of a single collection. You should consider using arrays in your schema 
to hold related, frequently-accessed data.

Example
-------

Consider the following example where documents in a company's 
``employees`` collection reference documents in an  ``organizations`` 
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 4
   
   // employees collection

   {
      "org_id": "sales", // reference to organization document
      "name": "James Potter",
      "title": "Sales Representative"
      ...
   }
   
   {
      "org_id": "sales",
      "name": "Severus Snape",
      "title": "Project Manager"
      ...
   }

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   // organizations collection

   {
      "_id": "sales",
      "name": "Sales Team"
      ...
   }

If an application frequently requests a list of employees for an 
organization, this schema structure forces you to do a 
:pipeline:`$lookup` of the ``employees`` collection and find 
employees that match an ``org_id`` every time.

Instead, you can list ``employees`` in an array on the 
organization document itself:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   {
       "_id": "sales",
       "name": "Sales Team",
       "employees": [
          {
             "name": "James Potter",
             "title": "Sales Representative"
             ...
          },
          {
             "name": "Severus Snape",
             "title": "Project Manager"
             ...  
          }
       ]
   }

By using arrays to hold related data, your application can retrieve the 
complete organization information, including associated employees, 
without :pipeline:`$lookup` operations. In this case, using arrays is 
more performant than storing the information in separate collections.

When to Use Arrays in Your Documents
------------------------------------

The performance cost of reading and writing to large arrays can
outweigh the benefit gained by avoiding :pipeline:`$lookup`
operations. If your arrays are unbounded or exceedingly large, those 
arrays may degrade read and write performance.

If you create an index on an array, each element in the array is 
indexed. If you write to that array frequently, the performance cost of 
indexing or re-indexing a potentially large array field may be 
significant.
