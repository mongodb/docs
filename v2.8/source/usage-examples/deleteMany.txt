Delete Multiple Documents

You can delete multiple documents from a collection in a single operation
by calling the `delete_many() <{+api+}/struct.Collection.html#method.delete_many>`__
method on a ``Collection`` instance.

Pass a query filter to the ``delete_many()`` method to delete documents in the
collection that match the filter. If you do not include a filter, MongoDB deletes
all the documents in the collection. 

The ``delete_many()`` method returns a `DeleteResult <{+api+}/results/struct.DeleteResult.html>`__
type. This type contains information about the delete operation, such as the total
number of documents deleted.

To learn more about delete operations, see the :ref:`rust-delete-guide` guide.

.. tip::

    To delete all documents in a collection, consider calling the ``drop()``
    method on a ``Collection`` instance. To learn more about the ``drop()`` 
    method, see the :ref:`rust-drop-collection` section of the Databases and
    Collections guide.

Example
-------

This example deletes all documents that match a query filter from the ``restaurants``
collection in the ``sample_restaurants`` database.

This example passes a query filter as a parameter to the ``delete_many()`` method.
The filter matches documents in which the value of the ``borough`` field is ``"Manhattan"``
and the value of the ``address.street`` field is ``"Broadway"``.
