   If your source and destination {+clusters+} are running a version before 
   MongoDB {+c2c-version+}, you can use legacy migration options described in this section.
   For legacy migration, you use the {+atlas-ui+} to either pull a MongoDB replica set
   or sharded {+cluster+} into an |service| replica set or sharded {+cluster+} using the {+atlas-ui+},
   or push data from a source replica set or sharded {+cluster+} monitored in
   |mms| to a destination replica set or sharded {+cluster+} in |service|.
   You can also use self-managed tools to migrate manually, load files, and
   seed or import data.

This section describes the following legacy migration options:

- :ref:`live-migration-pre60`
- :ref:`migrate-from-com`
- :ref:`self-managed-migration`
- `Migrate from Compose to MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/cloud/migrate-from-compose/>`__.
- `Migrate a MongoDB Replica Set from AWS to MongoDB Atlas on AWS 
  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/cloud/migrate-from-aws-to-atlas/>`__.
