Atlas Search Free and Shared Tier Limitations
=============================================

The following limitations apply to |fts| on ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` 
clusters only:

- .. include:: /includes/fact-fts-shared-tier-limitations.rst
  
- When you reach the maximum number of indexes allowed for the cluster tier, 
  you can upgrade your cluster tier to create additional indexes. If you 
  upgrade to a cluster tier where |fts| is available, the indexes are 
  rebuilt on the new cluster tier. If you upgrade to a cluster tier where 
  |fts| is not available like ``M10`` or ``M20``, the indexes are removed 
  and cannot be restored. 

- An index definition JSON object cannot exceed 3KB in size.

- You cannot add analyzer definitions to your indexes on the cluster. The 
  :guilabel:`Define Analyzers` button is visible, but disabled.
