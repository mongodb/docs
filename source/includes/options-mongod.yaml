  .. deprecated:: 2.6

  :option:`--diaglog` is for internal use and not intended for most users.

  Creates a very verbose, :term:`diagnostic log` for troubleshooting and
  recording various errors. MongoDB writes these log files in the
  :setting:`dbpath` directory in a series of files that begin with the
  string ``diaglog`` and end with the initiation time of the logging as a
  hex string.

  The specified value configures the level of verbosity. Possible values,
  and their impact are as follows.

  =========  ===================================
  **Value**  **Setting**
  ---------  -----------------------------------
     0       off. No logging.
     1       Log write operations.
     2       Log read operations.
     3       Log both read and write operations.
     7       Log write and some read operations.
  =========  ===================================

  You can use the :program:`mongosniff` tool to replay this output for
  investigation. Given a typical diaglog file, located at
  ``/data/db/diaglog.4f76a58c``, you might use a command in the following
  form to read these files:

  .. include:: /includes/warning-repair.rst

  .. include:: /includes/note-repair.rst

  .. versionchanged:: 2.1.2

  If you run the repair option *and* have data in a journal file,
  {{program}} refuses to start. In these cases you should start
  {{program}} without the :option:`--repair` option to allow {{program}}
  to recover data from the journal. This completes more quickly and is
  more likely to produce valid data files. To continue the repair
  operation despite the journal files, shut down {{program}} cleanly and
  restart with the :option:`--repair` option.

  :option:`--repair` copies data from the source data files into new data
  files in the :setting:`repairpath`, and then replaces the original data
  files with the repaired data files. *If* :setting:`repairpath` is on the

args: null
description: |
  Enables a mode where MongoDB uses a smaller default file

  size for data files and limits them to 512
  megabytes. :option:`--smallfiles` also reduces the size of each
  :term:`journal` files from 1 gigabyte to 128 megabytes.

  Use :option:`--smallfiles` if you have a large number of databases

  file for :ref:`membership authentication <x509-internal-authentication>`
  for the cluster or replica set.

  Specifies the password to de-crypt the x.509 certificate-key file
  specified with :option:`--sslClusterFile`. Use
  :option:`--sslClusterPassword` only if the certificate-key file is
  encrypted. In all cases, {{program}} will redact the password from all
  logging and reporting output.

  .. versionchanged:: 2.6 If the x.509 key file is encrypted and you do
     not specify :option:`--sslClusterPassword`, {{program}} will prompt
     for a passphrase. See :ref:`ssl-certificate-password`.

  Disables the requirement for SSL certificate validation that
  :option:`--sslCAFile` enables. With
  :option:`--sslWeakCertificateValidation`, {{program}} will accept
  connections when the client does not present a certificate when
  establishing the connection.

  If the client presents a certificate and {{program}} has
  :option:`--sslWeakCertificateValidation` enabled, {{program}} will
  validate the certificate using the root certificate chain specified by
  :option:`--sslCAFile` and reject clients with invalid certificates.

  Use :option:`--sslWeakCertificateValidation` if you have a mixed
  deployment that includes clients that do not or cannot present
  certificates to {{program}}.
