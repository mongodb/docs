What's New in 9.0
-----------------

The 9.0 release includes the following new features, improvements, and
fixes:

Railsmdb
~~~~~~~~

Alongside the release of {+odm+} v9.0, ``railsmdb``, a command-line utility
for creating, updating, managing, and maintaining Rails applications, is
generally available.

``railsmdb`` makes it easier to work with MongoDB from the command line
through common generators that {+ror+} developers are already
familiar with.

For example, you can use ``railsmdb`` to generate stubs for new {+odm+} models:

.. code-block:: sh

   bin/railsmdb generate model person

This will create a new model at ``app/models/person.rb``:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include Mongoid::Document
     include Mongoid::Timestamp
   end

You can specify the fields of the model:

.. code-block:: sh

   bin/railsmdb generate model person name:string birth:date

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include {+odm+}::Document
     include {+odm+}::Timestamp
     field :name, type: String
     field :birth, type: Date
   end

You can instruct the generator to make the new model a subclass of another,
by passing the ``--parent`` option:

.. code-block:: sh

   bin/railsmdb generate model student --parent=person

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Student < Person
     include {+odm+}::Timestamp
   end

If you need to store your models in a different collection than can be
inferred from the model name, you can specify ``--collection``:

.. code-block:: sh

   bin/railsmdb generate model course --collection=classes

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Course
     include {+odm+}::Document
     include {+odm+}::Timestamp
     store_in collection: 'classes'
   end

For more information see the :github:`mongoid-railsmdb repository
<mongodb/mongoid-railsmdb>` on GitHub.

Removal of Support for {+language+} 2.6 and J{+language+} 9.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+odm+} v9.0 requires {+language+} 2.7 or newer or J{+language+} 9.4.
Earlier {+language+} and J{+language+} versions are not supported.

Removal of Support for Rails 5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+odm+} v9.0 requires Rails 6.0 or newer. Earlier Rails versions are not
supported.

Removal of Deprecated Class ``Mongoid::Errors::InvalidStorageParent``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The deprecated class ``{+odm+}::Errors::InvalidStorageParent`` has been
removed.

``around_*`` Callbacks for Embedded Documents are Ignored
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+odm+} v8.x and older allow user to define ``around_*`` callbacks for embedded
documents. Starting in v9.0, these callbacks are ignored and will not be executed.
A warning will be printed to the console if such callbacks are defined.

If you want to restore the old behavior, you can set
``Mongoid.around_embedded_document_callbacks`` to true in your application.

.. note::

   Enabling ``around_*`` callbacks for embedded documents is not recommended
   as it may cause ``SystemStackError`` exceptions when a document has many
   embedded documents. See `MONGOID-5658
   <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5658>`__ for more details.

``for_js`` Method is Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``for_js`` method is deprecated and will be removed in {+odm+} v10.0.

Removal of Deprecated Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Breaking change:** The following config options are removed in {+odm+} v9.0.
Please ensure you have removed all references to these from your app.
If you were using ``config.load_defaults 8.1`` before upgrading, you will not
experience any behavior change. Refer to earlier release notes for the meaning
of each option.

- ``:use_activesupport_time_zone``
- ``:broken_aggregables``
- ``:broken_alias_handling``
- ``:broken_and``
- ``:broken_scoping``
- ``:broken_updates``
- ``:compare_time_by_ms``
- ``:legacy_attributes``
- ``:legacy_pluck_distinct``
- ``:legacy_triple_equals``
- ``:object_id_as_json_oid``
- ``:overwrite_chained_operators``

In addition, support for ``config.load_defaults`` versions v7.5 and
prior has been dropped (you must use a minimum of version v8.0.)

Removal of Deprecated Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Breaking change:** The following deprecated functionality is now removed:

- The ``Mongoid::QueryCache`` module has been removed. Please replace
  any usages 1-for-1 with ``Mongo::QueryCache``. The method
  ``{+odm+}::QueryCache#clear_cache`` should be replaced with
  ``Mongo::QueryCache#clear``. All other methods and submodules are
  identically named.
- ``Object#blank_criteria?`` method is removed (previously deprecated).
- ``Document#as_json :compact`` option is removed. Please call ```#compact`` on the
  returned ``Hash`` object instead.
- The deprecated class ``{+odm+}::Errors::InvalidStorageParent`` has
  been removed.

Get and Set Thread-Local Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 9.0.3

You can use the `Mongoid::Threaded.get <{+api+}/Mongoid/Threaded.html#get-instance_method>`__
and `Mongoid::Threaded.set <{+api+}/Mongoid/Threaded.html#set-instance_method>`__
methods to query and modify thread-local variables. To learn when to use
these methods, see the :ref:`mongoid-callbacks-thread-local-vars`
section of the Callbacks guide.

Index Verification Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 9.0.7

You can use the ``Mongoid.allow_duplicate_index_declarations``
configuration option to send index verification to
the server. If a duplicate index is declared, the server raises an
error. To learn more, see the :ref:`mongoid-config-options-all`
section of the Application Configuration guide.

``touch`` Method Clears Changed State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In {+odm+} v8.x and older, the ``touch`` method leaves models in the
changed state:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # v8.x behaviour
   band = Band.create!
   band.touch
   band.changed? # => true
   band.changes
   # => {"updated_at"=>[2023-01-30 13:12:57.477191135 UTC, 2023-01-30 13:13:11.482975646 UTC]}

Starting in v9.0, {+odm+} now correctly clears changed state after using
the ``touch`` method.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # v9.0 behavior
   band = Band.create!
   band.touch
   band.changed? # => false
   band.changes # => {}

Sandbox Mode for Rails Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+odm+} now supports Rails console sandbox mode. If the Rails console started
with ``--sandbox`` flag, {+odm+} starts a transaction on the ``:default`` client
before opening the console. This transaction won't be committed. Therefore, all
the commands executed in the console using the ``:default`` client won't
be persisted in the database.

.. note::

   If you execute commands in the sandbox mode *using any other client
   than default*, these changes will be persisted as usual.

New Transactions API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+odm+} 9.0 introduces new transactions API that is inspired by Active Record:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Band.transaction do
     Band.create(title: 'Led Zeppelin')
   end

   band = Band.create(title: 'Deep Purple')
   band.transaction do
     band.active = false
     band.save!
   end

To learn more, see the :ref:`mongoid-data-txn` guide.

Embedded Documents Always Use Parent Persistence Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+odm+} v8.x and older allow user to specify persistence context for an
embedded document (using ``store_in`` macro). In {+odm+} v9.0 these settings are
ignored for embedded documents. An embedded document now always uses the persistence
context of its parent.

Support for Passing Raw Values into Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When performing queries, it is now possible to skip {+odm+}'s type coercion logic
by using the ``{+odm+}::RawValue`` wrapper class. This can be useful when legacy
data in the database is of a different type than the field definition.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include {+odm+}::Document
     field :age, type: Integer
   end

   # Query for the string "42", not the integer 42
   Person.where(age: {+odm+}::RawValue("42"))

Raise ``AttributeNotLoaded`` Error When Accessing Fields Omitted from Query Projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When attempting to access a field on a model instance which was
excluded with the ``only`` or ``without`` query projections methods
when the instance was loaded, {+odm+} will now raise a
``Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded`` error.

.. code-block:: ruby

   Band.only(:name).first.label
   #=> raises {+odm+}::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded

   Band.without(:label).first.label = 'Sub Pop Records'
   #=> raises {+odm+}::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded

In earlier {+odm+} versions, the same conditions would raise an
``ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError``. Please check your code for
any {+odm+}-specific usages of this class, and change them to
``Mongoid::Errors::AttributeNotLoaded``. Note additionally that
``AttributeNotLoaded`` inherits from ``Mongoid::Errors::MongoidError``,
while ``ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError`` does not.

Use Configured Time Zone to Typecast ``Date`` to ``Time`` in Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When querying for a Time field using a Date value, {+odm+} now correctly
considers ``Time.zone`` to perform type conversion.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Magazine
     include {+odm+}::Document

     field :published_at, type: Time
   end

   Time.zone = 'Asia/Tokyo'

   Magazine.gte(published_at: Date.parse('2022-09-26'))
   #=> will return all results on or after Sept 26th, 2022
   #   at 0:00 in Asia/Tokyo time zone.

In prior {+odm+} versions, the above code would ignore the ``Time.zone``
(irrespective of the now-removed ``:use_activesupport_time_zone``
setting) and would always use the system time zone to perform the type
conversion.

Note that in prior {+odm+} versions, typecasting ``Date`` to ``Time``
during persistence operations was already correctly using time zone.

``touch`` Method on Embedded Documents Correctly Handles ``touch: false`` Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the ``touch: false`` option is set on an ``embedded_in`` relation,
calling the ``touch`` method on an embedded child document will not
invoke ``touch`` on its parent document.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Address
     include {+odm+}::Document
     include {+odm+}::Timestamps

     embedded_in :mall, touch: false
   end

   class Mall
     include {+odm+}::Document
     include {+odm+}::Timestamps

     embeds_many :addresses
   end

   mall = Mall.create!
   address = mall.addresses.create!

   address.touch
   #=> updates address.updated_at but not mall.updated_at

In addition, the ``touch`` method has been optimized to perform one
persistence operation per parent document, even when using multiple
levels of nested embedded documents.

``embedded_in`` Associations Default to ``touch: true``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updating an embedded sub-document will now automatically touch the
parent, unless you explicitly set ``touch: false`` on the relation:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Address
     include {+odm+}::Document
     include {+odm+}::Timestamps

     embedded_in :mall, touch: false
   end

For all other associations, the default remains ``touch: false``.

Flipped Default for ``:replace`` Option in ``upsert``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+odm+} v8.1 added the ``:replace`` option to the ``upsert`` method. This
option was used to specify whether or not the existing document should be
updated or replaced.

{+odm+} v9.0 flips the default of this flag from ``true`` to ``false``.
This means that, by default, {+odm+} v9.0 updates the existing document and
does not replace it.

Immutability of the ``_id`` Field Enforced
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before {+odm+} v9.0, mutating the ``_id`` field behaved inconsistently
depending on whether the document was top-level or embedded, and depending on
how the update was performed. In v9.0, changing the ``_id`` field will now
raise an exception when the document is saved, if the document had been
previously persisted.

{+odm+} 9.0 also introduces a new feature flag, ``immutable_ids``, which
defaults to ``true``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   {+odm+}::Config.immutable_ids = true

When set to ``false``, the older, inconsistent behavior is restored.

Support for Field Aliases on Index Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support has been added to use aliased field names in the following options
of the ``index`` macro: ``partial_filter_expression``, ``weights``,
``wildcard_projection``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Person
     include {+odm+}::Document
     field :a, as: :age
     index({ age: 1 }, { partial_filter_expression: { age: { '$gte' => 20 } })
   end

.. note::

   The expansion of field name aliases in index options such as
   ``partial_filter_expression`` is performed according to the behavior of MongoDB
   server 6.0. Future server versions may change how they interpret these options,
   and {+odm+}'s functionality may not support such changes.

BSON 5 and ``BSON::Decimal128`` Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When BSON 4 or earlier is present, any field declared as ``BSON::Decimal128`` will
return a ``BSON::Decimal128`` value. When BSON 5 is present, however, any field
declared as ``BSON::Decimal128`` will return a ``BigDecimal`` value by default.

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Model
     include {+odm+}::Document

     field :decimal_field, type: BSON::Decimal128
   end

   # under BSON <= 4
   Model.first.decimal_field.class #=> BSON::Decimal128

   # under BSON >= 5
   Model.first.decimal_field.class #=> BigDecimal

If you need literal ``BSON::Decimal128`` values with BSON 5, you may instruct
{+odm+} to allow literal ``BSON::Decimal128`` fields:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Model.first.decimal_field.class #=> BigDecimal

   {+odm+}.allow_bson5_decimal128 = true
   Model.first.decimal_field.class #=> BSON::Decimal128

.. note::

   The ``allow_bson5_decimal128`` option only has any effect under
   BSON 5 and later. BSON 4 and earlier ignore the setting entirely.

Search Index Management for MongoDB Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When connected to MongoDB Atlas, {+odm+} now supports creating and removing
search indexes. You may do so programmatically, via the ``Mongoid::SearchIndexable``
API:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class SearchablePerson
     include {+odm+}::Document

     search_index { ... } # define the search index here
   end

   # create the declared search indexes; this returns immediately, but the
   # search indexes may take several minutes before they are available.
   SearchablePerson.create_search_indexes

   # query the available search indexes
   SearchablePerson.search_indexes.each do |index|
     # ...
   end

   # remove all search indexes from the model's collection
   SearchablePerson.remove_search_indexes

If you are not connected to MongoDB Atlas, the search index definitions are
ignored. Trying to create, enumerate, or remove search indexes will result in
an error.

There are also rake tasks available, for convenience:

.. code-block:: bash

   # create search indexes for all models; waits for indexes to be created
   # and shows progress on the terminal.
   $ rake mongoid:db:create_search_indexes

   # as above, but returns immediately and lets the indexes be created in the
   # background
   $ rake WAIT_FOR_SEARCH_INDEXES=0 mongoid:db:create_search_indexes

   # removes search indexes from all models
   $ rake mongoid:db:remove_search_indexes

Removal of ``Time.configured``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Time.configured`` returned either the time object wrapping the configured
time zone, or the standard {+language+} ``Time`` class. This allowed you to query
a time value even if no time zone had been configured.

{+odm+} now requires that you set a time zone if you intend to do
anything with time values (including using timestamps in your documents).
Any uses of ``Time.configured`` must be replaced with ``Time.zone``.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # before:
   puts Time.configured.now

   # after:
   puts Time.zone.now

   # or, better for finding the current Time specifically:
   puts Time.current

If you do not set a time zone, you will see errors in your code related
to ``nil`` values. If you are using Rails, the default time zone is already
set to UTC. If you are not using Rails, you may set a time zone at the start
of your program like this:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Time.zone = 'UTC'

This will set the time zone to UTC. You can see all available time zone names
by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ruby -ractive_support/values/time_zone \
     -e 'puts ActiveSupport::TimeZone::MAPPING.keys'

Records Remember Persistence Context of Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following code:

.. code-block:: ruby

   record = Model.with(collection: 'other_collection') { Model.first }
   record.update(field: 'value')

Before {+odm+} v9.0, the preceding code silently fails to execute the update,
because the storage options (here, the specification of an alternate
collection for the model) would not be remembered by the record. Thus, the
record would be loaded from ``other_collection``, but when updated, would attempt
to look for and update the document in the default collection for Model. To
make this work, you would have had to specify the collection explicitly for
every update.

As of {+odm+} v9.0, records that are created or loaded under explicit storage
options, will remember those options (including a named client,
a different database, or a different collection).

If you need the legacy (pre-v9.0) behavior, you can enable it with the following
flag:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Mongoid.legacy_persistence_context_behavior = true

This flag defaults to false in {+odm+} v9.0.
