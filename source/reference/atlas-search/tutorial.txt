This tutorial takes you through the steps of setting up and querying
an |fts| index. You will use a collection with movie data
from the |service| :doc:`sample data set </sample-data>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/notes/atlas-search-versions.rst

To complete this tutorial you will need:

- An |service| cluster with MongoDB version 4.2 or higher.

- The :doc:`sample datasets </sample-data>` loaded into your |service| 
  cluster.

- {+mongosh+} on your local machine.

.. include:: /includes/fact-fts-required-roles.rst

You must meet the following additional prerequisites if you want to
create an |fts| index using the |fts| API:

- Have an API Key assigned the :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` or
  :authrole:`Project Owner` role for your |service| project. An API Key
  consists of a public and private key pair.

  .. tip::

     Users with the :authrole:`Project Owner` role can :doc:`create and
     assign project access to API Keys
     </reference/api/projectApiKeys/create-one-apiKey-in-one-project/>`.

- Send the request from a client that appears in the access list for 
  your API Key.

  .. tip::

     Users with the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role can :doc:`create
     access list entries
     </reference/api/api-access-list/create-api-access-entries/>` for
     your API Key.
