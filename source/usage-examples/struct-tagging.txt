   :description: Learn how to use struct tags in Go to control BSON field names when inserting documents with the MongoDB Go Driver.

You can specify the way that the Go Driver converts Go
structs to :manual:`BSON </reference/bson-types/>` by using struct tags.

Example
-------

.. include:: /includes/usage-examples/run-example-tip.rst

The following code declares a struct of type ``BlogPost``. This struct
contains a struct tag that maps the ``WordCount`` field to the BSON
field name ``word_count``. By default, the driver marshals the other
fields as the lowercase of the struct field name:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/struct-tag.go
   :start-after: begin struct
   :end-before: end struct
   :language: go
   :dedent:

The following example creates a ``BlogPost`` instance and inserts it
into the ``posts`` collection. During the insert operation, the driver
interprets the struct tag to marshal the ``WordCount``
struct field as ``word_count``:

.. include:: /includes/usage-examples/run-example-tip.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/struct-tag.go
   :start-after: begin create and insert
   :end-before: end create and insert
   :language: go
   :dedent:

Expected Result
---------------

After you run the full example, you can find the following document
in the ``posts`` collection:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
       "_id" : ObjectId("..."),
       "title" : "Annuals vs. Perennials?",
       "author" : "Sam Lee",
       "word_count" : 682,
       "lastupdated": ...,
       "tags" : ["seasons", "gardening", "flower"]
   }
