Starting in version 2.6, MongoDB can use :doc:`index
intersection </core/index-intersection>` to fulfill queries. The choice
between creating compound indexes that support your queries or relying
on index intersection depends on the specifics of your system. See
:ref:`index-intersection-compound-indexes` for more details.
