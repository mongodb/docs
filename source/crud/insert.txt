Overview

In this guide, you will insert data into MongoDB.

.. time:: 15

What You'll Need
----------------

.. include:: /includes/prereqs_read_CRUD.rst

Check Your Environment
----------------------

.. include:: /includes/check_for_drivers_install.rst

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-selector:: drivers

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Connect to Your MongoDB Instance

      .. include:: /includes/drivers_connect.rst

   .. step:: Switch to the ``test`` Database

      .. include:: /includes/bind_db.rst

   .. step:: Insert a Single Document

      Now you are ready to create your first document in MongoDB.

      MongoDB stores documents as BSON, a binary form of JavaScript Object
      Notation ``JSON``. The documents are stored in collections.

      .. include:: /includes/insert_one.rst
      .. include:: /includes/driver-example-insert-1.rst

      Unlike SQL tables, MongoDB collections have dynamic schemas. That is,
      a single collection can store documents that differ in shapes (i.e.
      contain different fields and value types). And unlike SQL, no DDL
      operation is required to add or remove fields or modify field types.
      You just update the documents directly.

      .. note::
    
         While MongoDB does support dynamic collection definitions, you can
         also enforce a uniform schema for the documents in your collection.
         See :ref:`JSON Schema validation <schema-validation-json>`.
