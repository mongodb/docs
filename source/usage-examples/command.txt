=============
Run a Command
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can run all raw database operations using the
``MongoDatabase.runCommand()`` method. A raw database operation is a
command you can execute directly on the MongoDB server CLI. These
commands include administrative and diagnostic tasks, such as fetching
server stats or initializing a replica set. Call the ``runCommand()``
method with a Bson command object on an instance of a ``MongoDatabase``
to run your raw database operation.

.. note::
    Use the :manual:`mongo shell </reference/mongo-shell>` for
    administrative tasks instead of the Java driver whenever possible,
    since these tasks are often quicker and easier to implement with the
    shell than in a Java application.

The ``runCommand()`` method accepts a command in Bson format.
By default, ``runCommand`` returns an object of type
``org.bson.Document`` containing the output of the database command. You
can specify a return type for ``runCommand()`` as an optional second
parameter.

Example
-------

In the following sample code, we send the ``dbStats`` command to request
statistics from a specific MongoDB database.

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/Command.java
  :language: java


When you run the above command, you should see output similar to the
following:

.. code-block:: none

   dbStats: {"db": "sample_mflix", "collections": 5, "views": 0, "objects": 75595, "avgObjSize": 692.1003770090614, "dataSize": 52319328, "storageSize": 29831168, "numExtents": 0, "indexes": 9, "indexSize": 14430208, "fileSize": 0, "nsSizeMB": 0, "ok": 1}
