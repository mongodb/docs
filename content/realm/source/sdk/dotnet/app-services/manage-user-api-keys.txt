Manage User API Keys - .NET SDK

Application users can generate user API keys with the .NET SDK. You
can allow devices or services to communicate with Atlas App Services
on behalf of a user by associating a unique user API key with each
device or service.

User API keys are always associated with a user object created by another
non-anonymous authentication provider. Each user can associate up to 20
user keys with their account.

.. note::

   User API keys are not the same as **server API keys**, which allow a
   user or service to directly authenticate with App Services using the
   :ref:`API Key authentication provider <dotnet-login-api-key>`. To learn
   more about server API keys, see :ref:`API Key Authentication
   <api-key-authentication>`.
