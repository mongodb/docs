Indexing Strategies
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The best indexes for your application are based on a number of factors,
including the kinds of queries you expect, the ratio of reads to writes,
and the amount of free memory on your system.

When developing your indexing strategy you should have a deep
understanding of:

- The application's queries.

- The relative frequency of each query in the application.

- The current indexes created for your collections.

- Which indexes the most common queries use.

The best overall strategy for designing indexes is to profile a variety
of index configurations with data sets similar to the ones you'll be
running in production to see which configurations perform best.

MongoDB can only use *one* index to support any given
operation. However, each clause of an :operator:`$or` query may use a
different index.
