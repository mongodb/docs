You cannot copy data between a MongoDB 4.0 :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance with :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion (FCV) <view-fcv>` 4.0
and a MongoDB version 3.6 :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

.. note::

   You cannot copy data between a MongoDB 4.0 :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instance (regardless of the FCV value) and a MongoDB 3.4 and earlier
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

For example:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Instance 1
     - Instance 2
     - 

   * - Version 4.0 ``mongod`` with FCV 4.0
     - Version 4.0 ``mongod`` with FCV 4.0
     - Can copy data.

   * - Version 4.0 ``mongod`` with FCV 4.0
     - Version 4.0 ``mongod`` with FCV 3.6
     - Can copy data.

   * - Version 4.0 ``mongod`` with FCV 4.0
     - Version 3.6 ``mongod`` with FCV 3.6
     - Cannot copy data.  Instance 2 must be a MongoDB version 4.0

   * - Version 4.0 ``mongod`` with FCV 3.6
     - Version 3.6 ``mongod`` with FCV 3.6
     - Can copy data.

   * - Version 4.0 ``mongod`` with FCV 3.6
     - Version 3.6 ``mongod`` with FCV 3.4
     - Can copy data.

In general, if the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance has its
:ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion (FCV) <view-fcv>` set to its MongoDB
version, you cannot copy data between that instance and a
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance of an earlier MongoDB version.

Operations that copy data include:

- :method:`db.cloneCollection()` and the command :dbcommand:`cloneCollection`
- :method:`db.cloneDatabase()` and the command :dbcommand:`clone`
- :method:`db.copyDatabase()` and the command :dbcommand:`copydb`
