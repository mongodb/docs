The ``require()`` and ``load()`` methods include files and modules in
your scripts for added functionality. However, ``require()`` and
``load()`` differ in their behaviors and availability.

Types of Scripts in mongosh
---------------------------

You can use the following types of scripts with ``mongosh``:

- ``mongosh`` scripts, which can be any of the following:

  - Code entered directly into the REPL.
  - The :ref:`mongoshrc.js <mongoshrc-js>` file.
  - Code loaded with the :ref:`load() <mongosh-native-method-load>` method.

- Node.js scripts, which are any scripts loaded with ``require()``,
  including npm packages. These scripts are always files.

Availability of require() and load()
------------------------------------

The ``require()`` and ``load()`` methods differ in availability
depending on the type of script you are using.

- In ``mongosh`` scripts, both ``require()`` and ``load()`` are available.

- In Node.js scripts, only ``require()`` is available.

File Paths for require() and load()
-----------------------------------

The type of script determines how you specify file paths with
``require()`` or ``load()``.

- In ``mongosh`` scripts:

  - ``require()`` uses the standard
    `Node.js module resolution algorithm
    <https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html>`__, starting from the current
    working directory of the shell.

  - ``load()`` takes either:
  
    - An absolute path, or
    - A relative path. When using a relative path, the path is always
      interpreted as relative to the current working directory of the
      shell.

- In Node.js scripts, ``require()`` uses the standard
  `Node.js module resolution algorithm
  <https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html>`__, starting from the file
  where ``require()`` was called.

.. tip::

   To return the current working directory of the shell, run the
   :ref:`pwd() <mongosh-native-method-pwd>` method from your script.

   To change the shell's working directory, use the :ref:`cd() 
   <mongosh-native-method-cd>` method in your script.

Load External Code in a mongosh Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can load external code in a ``mongosh`` script file, such as an npm
package or a separate ``mongosh`` script.

- To load a ``mongosh`` script from another ``mongosh`` script, use
  the ``__dirname`` environment variable. The ``__dirname`` environment
  variable returns the absolute path of the directory containing the
  file being executed.

  .. example::

     To load a ``mongosh`` script named ``test-suite.js`` from another
     ``mongosh`` script, add the following line to your script:

     .. code-block:: javascript

       load(__dirname + '/test-suite.js')

  Using the ``_dirname`` variable to specify an absolute path ensures
  that the separate script you are loading is not affected by external
  factors such as where ``mongosh`` started.

- To load a Node.js script from a ``mongosh`` script, use the
  ``require()`` method.

  .. example::

     To load the `date-fns <https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns>`__
     module from a ``mongosh`` script called ``test-suite2.js``, add the
     following lines to your script:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        const localRequire = require('date-fns').createRequire(__filename);  
        const fileExports = localRequire('./test-suite2.js'); }

require() Packaging Considerations
----------------------------------

Access to the mongosh API
-------------------------

- ``mongosh`` scripts can use the ``mongosh`` API.

- Node.js scripts do not have access to the ``mongosh`` API.

For example, the ``db`` global variable (used to display the current
database) is available inside of ``mongosh`` scripts. It is not
available inside of Node.js scripts.

.. important::

  ``mongosh`` scripts and Node.js scripts run in different `contexts
  <https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html#vm_what_does_it_mean_to_contextify_an_object>`__.
  They may exhibit different behaviors when the same command is run in
  each type of script, such as returning different data types.
  Therefore, you may observe unexpected results if you run ``mongosh``
  code inside of a Node.js script.

  Generally, you should not keep mongosh-specific code inside Node.js
  scripts.
