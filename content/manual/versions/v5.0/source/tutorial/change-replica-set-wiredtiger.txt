===============================================
Change a Self-Managed Replica Set to WiredTiger
===============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


.. note:: 

   - .. include:: /includes/collMod-note.rst

   - You must upgrade to WiredTiger. MongoDB removed the deprecated MMAPv1 
     storage engine in version 4.2. 

Use this tutorial to update a replica set to use :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>`. The procedure updates the replica set in a
rolling fashion to avoid downtime.

Considerations
--------------

Replica sets can have members with different storage engines. As such,
you can update members to use the WiredTiger storage engine in a
rolling fashion.

.. _rs-mmapv1-wt-4.0-psa:

PSA 3-member Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern, available for WiredTiger, 
is enabled by default. However, in three-member replica sets with a 
primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture, you can disable the 
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern. 
Disabling the :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern for a three-member 
PSA architecture avoids possible cache-pressure build up.

The :ref:`procedure <change-replica-set-wiredtiger-procedure>`
below disables :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern for
PSA architecture by including
:option:`--enableMajorityReadConcern false <mongod
--enableMajorityReadConcern>`.  

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-disable-rc-majority.rst

For more information on PSA architecture and read concern
:readconcern:`"majority"`,
see :ref:`disable-read-concern-majority`.

Default Bind to Localhost

XFS and WiredTiger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the WiredTiger storage engine, using XFS for data bearing nodes is
recommended on Linux. For more information, see
:ref:`prod-notes-linux-file-system`.

MMAPv1 Only Restrictions

Procedure
---------

The following procedure updates the replica set in a rolling fashion.
The procedure updates the :term:`secondary` members first, then steps
down the :term:`primary`, and updates the stepped-down member.


To update a member to WiredTiger, the procedure removes a member's
data, starts :binary:`~bin.mongod` with WiredTiger, and performs an
:doc:`initial sync </tutorial/resync-replica-set-member>`.


A. Update the secondary members to WiredTiger.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Update the secondary members one at a time:

.. include:: /includes/steps/change-replica-set-wiredtiger.rst

Repeat the steps for the remaining secondary members, updating them one
at a time.

B. Step down the primary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   If updating all members of the replica set to use WiredTiger, ensure
   that all secondary members have been updated first before updating
   the primary.

Once all the secondary members have been upgraded to WiredTiger,
connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the primary and use
:method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and force an election
of a new primary.

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.stepDown()

C. Update the stepped down primary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the primary has stepped down and become a secondary, update the
secondary to use WiredTiger as before:
