#. Ensure your :ref:`payment method <payment-method>` has 
   sufficient funds and supports payments made in |usd|.

#. Speak with your bank or credit card issuer to ensure your payment 
   method is authorized to make transactions with MongoDB.

#. Use an alternative :ref:`payment method <payment-method>`.

#. :ref:`Request support <request-support>` through the 
   |service| console.
