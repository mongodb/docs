Overview 
--------

You can limit the amount of data that {+adf+} processes for your
{+fdi+}\s to control costs. To limit the amount of :ref:`processed data
<atlas-data-federation-billing>`, you can configure query limits per
{+fdi+} and for all {+fdi+}\s in your project. The query limits that you
configure only apply to data processing costs and don't apply to other
{+adf+} costs such as :ref:`data retrieval and transfer
<atlas-data-federation-billing>`. 

You can configure one limit *per query*, *per day*, *per week*, and *per
month* per project and per {+fdi+}. {+adf+} considers each limit of each
type independent of other configured limits. If you configure the same
type of limit for the project and for a {+fdi+} in the project, {+adf+}
enforces the more restrictive limit of the two. Limit values must be
between 1GiB (1024^3 bytes) and 1EiB.

By default, {+adf+} sets a 100TB limit on the amount of processed data
per month for all new {+fdi+}\s. 

.. note:: 

   {+adf+} enforces the project limit per cloud object storage. For
   example, suppose you have 2 {+fdi+}s, one on |aws| and another on
   |azure|. {+adf+} allows scans of up to 100TB per {+fdi+} for a
   total of 200TB for the project. 

.. _adf-query-limit-amount-behavior:

What Happens When {+adf+} Reaches the Data Limit?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the amount of processed data reaches the configured limit amount,
{+adf+} stops processing data for the query that has reached the
limit if the limit type is *per query*. For limits of other types, 
{+adf+} doesn't execute any new queries until the limit resets based on
the configured limit type. That is, {+adf+} doesn't execute any new
queries until: 

- The next calendar day beginning at ``00:00`` :abbr:`UTC (Coordinated
  Universal Time)` for limit type of *per day*.
- The next calendar week beginning on Monday at ``00:00`` :abbr:`UTC
  (Coordinated Universal Time)` for limit type of *per week*.
- The next calendar month beginning on the first day (1st) of the month
  at ``00:00`` :abbr:`UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)` for limit type
  of *per month*. 

If you configure the same type of limit for both the project and
{+fdi+}\s in the project, but with different limit amounts for the
project and the {+fdi+}\s in the project, the following apply:  

- If {+adf+} reaches the project limit amount before reaching the limit
  amount for any {+fdi+} in the project, {+adf+} allows all running
  queries against all {+fdi+}\s in the project to complete.
- If {+adf+} doesn't reach the limit amount for the project, but reaches
  the limit amount set for any {+fdi+} in the project, {+adf+} allows all
  running queries against that {+fdi+} to complete, but doesn't execute
  any new queries against that {+fdi+}. {+adf+} continues to execute
  queries against other {+fdi+}\s in the project until it reaches the
  limit amount set for the project. When {+adf+} reaches the project
  limit amount, {+adf+} allows all running queries against all {+fdi+}\s
  in the project to complete, but doesn't execute any new queries
  against any {+fdi+}\s in the project. 

{+adf+} displays a warning in the {+atlas-ui+} when {+adf+} reaches the
data processing limit. Additionally, you can configure {+adf+} to
terminate queries that exceed the limit :abbr:`ASAP (as soon as
possible)` when {+adf+} reaches the limit instead of allowing running
queries to complete. 

.. _adf-query-limit-termination-behavior:

What Happens When You Enable Query Termination?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you configure {+adf+} to terminate queries that exceed the limit,
{+adf+} attempts to terminate the queries when {+adf+} reaches the 
applicable limit. While {+adf+} attempts to terminate the query, {+adf+}
might exceed the limit marginally. {+adf+} doesn't return any results
and returns only an error. However, you will see data processing charges
for the amount of data that {+adf+} processed before it reached the
limit. 

If you configure the same type of limit for both the project and
{+fdi+}\s in the project, but with different limit amounts and query
termination settings, {+adf+} will terminate the query only when the
amount of data that {+adf+} processes reaches the limit amount that you 
associated with query termination.

.. example:: 

   Suppose a 100 GB *per week* project limit with termination enabled
   and a 60 GB *per week* {+fdi+} limit with termination disabled.
   
   - When one or more queries against the {+fdi+} reach the 60 GB limit,
     {+adf+} terminates all running queries against the {+fdi+} and
     doesn't execute any new queries. {+adf+} continues to execute all
     running and new queries against other {+fdi+}\s in the project
     until {+adf+} reaches the project limit of 100 GB.
   - When one or more queries reach the 100 GB limit for the project,
     {+adf+} doesn't execute any new queries and terminates all queries
     against all {+fdi+}\s in the project.

Required Access
---------------

To :ref:`add <adf-add-query-limits>`, :ref:`edit
<adf-edit-query-limits>`, or :ref:`delete <adf-delete-query-limits>`
query limits, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` access to the
project. Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add
themselves as a ``Project Owner`` to the project before adding, editing,
or deleting query limits. 

To :ref:`view <adf-view-query-limits>` limits on queries, you must have
:authrole:`Project Read Only` access to the project or higher.

Procedures 
----------

.. _adf-add-query-limits:

Add Query Limits 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure limits on the amount of data processed for your
queries from the {+atlas-cli+}, {+atlas-ui+}, and |api|. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli
 
      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-dataFederation-queryLimits-create.rst

   .. tab:: UI
      :tabid: atlasui

      .. procedure:: 
         :style: normal 

         .. step:: Navigate to your {+fdi+}\s page.

            a. Log in to |service-fullname|.
            #. Select the {+df+} option on the left-hand navigation. 

         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Manage Query Limits` to configure limits per {+fdi+} or for all {+fdi+}\s in the project.

            You can configure limits for the project and per {+fdi+}.
            Project level query limits apply to all {+fdi+}\s in the
            project, which prevents new queries against any {+fdi+} when
            the amount of processed data reaches the limit. Query limits
            on a {+fdi+} apply to only that {+fdi+}, and {+adf+} won't
            execute any new queries against that {+fdi+} when the amount
            of processed data reaches the limit. You can also,
            optionally, enable termination of queries when {+adf+}
            reaches the configured limit. 

         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Add Query Limit` to configure the limit.

            You can configure the following fields in the :guilabel:`Add
            Query Limit` window:

            .. list-table:: 
               :header-rows: 1

               * - Field Name 
                 - Description 

               * - :guilabel:`Limit For`
                 - Specify whether the limit is for a project or {+fdi+}. Click
                   the dropdown and select the project or {+fdi+} to apply the
                   limit to. After you add the limit, you can't modify this
                   setting.  

               * - :guilabel:`Limit Type`
                 - Specify the limit duration. Click the dropdown to choose
                   one of the following:

                   - :guilabel:`Per query` - Indicates that the limit is per
                     individual query.  
                   - :guilabel:`Per day` - Indicates that the limit is per
                     calendar day beginning at ``00:00`` :abbr:`UTC
                     (Coordinated Universal Time)`.
                   - :guilabel:`Per week` - Indicates that the limit is per
                     calendar week beginning on Monday at ``00:00``
                     :abbr:`UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)`.
                   - :guilabel:`Per month` - Indicates that the limit is per
                     calendar month beginning on the first day (1st) of the
                     month at ``00:00`` :abbr:`UTC (Coordinated
                     Universal Time)`. 

                   After you add the limit, you can't modify this setting.

               * - :guilabel:`Limit Amount`
                 - Specify the amount of data in ``MB``, ``GB``, or ``TB`` to
                   limit to.

               * - :guilabel:`Terminate Queries`
                 - Toggle to enable query termination. You can't enable query
                   termination for **Per query** limit type because, by
                   default, {+adf+} terminates the query when it reaches
                   the limit for this limit type.

         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Add Query Limit` for the changes to take effect. 

            For limits of type :guilabel:`Per query`, the changes take effect
            immediately and {+adf+} enforces the limit for all new
            queries only. For limits of other types, the following apply:

            - :guilabel:`Per day` - The changes take effect at the start of
              Monday in the current week in |utc| time.
            - :guilabel:`Per week` - The changes take effect at the start of 
              Monday in the current week in |utc| time.
            - :guilabel:`Per month` - The changes take effect on the first
              day, the beginning of the the monthly billing period, for the
              project in |utc| time.

   .. tab:: API
      :tabid: openapi

      To configure query limits from the |api|, send a ``POST`` request 
      to the ``limits`` endpoint. 
      
      To configure a limit that applies to all {+fdi+}\s in the project,
      you must specify the unique ID of the project and the name of the
      limit to set. To learn more about the syntax and options for
      setting limits for all {+fdi+}\s in the project, see
      :oas-bump-atlas-op:`API <setgrouplimit>`. 

      To configure a limit for one {+fdi+} in a project,
      specify the unique ID of the project and the name of the {+fdi+}
      in the project. To learn more about the syntax and options for
      setting limits for one {+fdi+} in a project, see :oas-bump-atlas-op:`API 
      <setgroupdatafederationlimit>`.
