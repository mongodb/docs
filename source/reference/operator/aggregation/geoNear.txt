Definition
----------

.. pipeline:: $geoNear

   .. versionadded:: 2.4

   Outputs documents in order of nearest to farthest from a specified
   point.

   The :pipeline:`$geoNear` stage has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $geoNear: { <geoNear options> } }

   The :pipeline:`$geoNear` operator accepts a :term:`document` that
   contains the following :pipeline:`$geoNear` options. Specify all
   distances in the same units as those of the processed documents'
   coordinate system:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/pipeline-geoNear-field.rst

Behavior
--------

When using :pipeline:`$geoNear`, consider that:

- You can only use :pipeline:`$geoNear` as the first stage of a
  pipeline.

- You must include the ``distanceField`` option. The
  ``distanceField`` option specifies the field that will contain
  the calculated distance.

- The collection must have a :doc:`geospatial index
  </core/geospatial-indexes>`.

- The :pipeline:`$geoNear` requires that a collection have *at most*
  only one :doc:`2d index </core/2d>` and/or only one
  :doc:`2dsphere index </core/2dsphere>`.

- You do not need to specify which field in
  the documents hold the coordinate pair or point. Because
  :pipeline:`$geoNear` requires that the collection have a single
  geospatial index, :pipeline:`$geoNear` implicitly uses the indexed
  field.

- If using a :doc:`2dsphere index </core/2dsphere>`, you must specify
  ``spherical: true``.

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-geoNear.rst

Generally, the options for :pipeline:`$geoNear` are similar to the
:dbcommand:`geoNear` command with the following exceptions:

- ``distanceField`` is a mandatory field for the
  :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline operator; the option does not exist
  in the :dbcommand:`geoNear` command.

- ``includeLocs`` accepts a ``string`` in the :pipeline:`$geoNear`
  pipeline operator and a ``boolean`` in the :dbcommand:`geoNear`
  command.

Example
-------

Consider a collection ``places`` that has a ``2dsphere`` index. The following
aggregation finds at most ``5`` unique documents with a location at
most 2 units from the center ``[ -73.99279 , 40.719296 ]`` and have ``type`` equal
to ``public``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.aggregate([
      {
        $geoNear: {
           near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.99279 , 40.719296 ] },
           distanceField: "dist.calculated",
           maxDistance: 2,
           query: { type: "public" },
           includeLocs: "dist.location",
           num: 5,
           spherical: true
        }
      }
   ])

The aggregation returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : 8,
      "name" : "Sara D. Roosevelt Park",
      "type" : "public",
      "location" : {
         "type" : "Point",
         "coordinates" : [ -73.9928, 40.7193 ]
      },
      "dist" : {
         "calculated" : 0.9539931676365992,
         "location" : {
            "type" : "Point",
            "coordinates" : [ -73.9928, 40.7193 ]
         }
      }
   }

The matching document contains two new fields:

- ``dist.calculated`` field that contains the calculated distance, and

- ``dist.location`` field that contains the location used in the
  calculation.

Minimum Distance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.2

The following example uses the option ``minDistance`` to specify
the minimum distance from the center point that the documents can be.
MongoDB limits the results to those documents that fall outside the
specified distance from the center point.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.aggregate([ 
      {
        $geoNear: {
           near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.99279 , 40.719296 ] },
           distanceField: "dist.calculated",
           minDistance: 2,
           query: { type: "public" },
           includeLocs: "dist.location",
           num: 5,
           spherical: true
        }
      }
   ])
