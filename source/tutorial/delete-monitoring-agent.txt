===================================
Remove Monitoring Agents from |MMS|
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The |mms| adds a Monitoring Agent when the agent reports to the service upon
startup. MMS does not send commands to a Monitoring Agent. Nor can the MMS stop
a Monitoring Agent from reporting data.

The |mms| removes an agent when the agent does not report to the service for
more than 24 hours. A stopped or inactive Monitoring Agent will not appear in
the list of agents on the :guilabel:`Agents` page in the
:guilabel:`Administration` tab.

There is no way to delete a Monitoring Agent from MMS except to remove a
Monitoring Agent on your server then wait 24 hours.

If you delete a Monitoring Agent by removing it from your environment, thus
removing it from MMS, also delete any alerts for the Monitoring Agent. For
example, an **Agent Down** alert may trigger if MMS detects 0 Monitoring Agents,
you have removed your Monitoring Agent, and have an active alert to notify you
when a Monitoring Agent is down.
