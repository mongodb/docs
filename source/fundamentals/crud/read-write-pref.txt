Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the **write concern**, **read concern**, and
**read preference** configurations to modify the way that MongoDB runs
create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on replica sets.

You can set write concern, read concern, and read preference options at the following
levels:

- Client, which sets the *default for all operation executions* unless overridden
- Session
- Transaction
- Database
- Collection

This list also indicates the increasing order of precedence of the option settings. For
example, if you set a read concern level for a transaction, it will override a read
concern level set for the client.

These options allow you to customize the causal consistency and availability of the data
in your replica sets.

Write Concern
-------------

The write concern specifies the level of acknowledgement requested from MongoDB for write
operations, such as an insert or update, before the operation successfully returns.
Operations that do not specify an explicit write concern inherit the global default write
concern settings.

For more information, see :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>` in the
Server manual. For detailed API documentation, see the `WriteConcern API documentation
<{+api+}/classes/WriteConcern.html>`__.

The following table describes the ``WriteConcern`` parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
  
   * - ``w`` *(optional)*
     - `W <{+api+}/types/W.html>`__
     - Requests acknowledgment that the write operation has propagated to a specified
       number of ``mongod`` instances or to ``mongod`` instances that are labelled specified tags

   * - ``wtimeoutMS`` *(optional)*
     - number
     - Specifies a time limit to prevent write operations from blocking indefinitely

   * - ``journal`` *(optional)*
     - boolean
     - Requests acknowledgment that the write operation has been written to the on-disk journal 

Example: Set the Write Concern for a Single Write Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code uses custom ``WriteConcern`` settings while creating new a document:

.. code-block:: js

   myDB.myCollection.insertOne( 
      { name: "anotherDocumentName" }, 
      { writeConcern: 
        { w: 2, wtimeoutMS: 5000 } 
      } 
   );

Example: Retrieve and Apply an Existing Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
This code uses the ``fromOptions()`` method to construct a ``WriteConcern`` from the
options of an existing database reference, ``myDB``. Note that ``myDB`` could be replaced
with a reference to any entity that accepts a write concern option. Then the new write
concern is applied to a document, ``myDoc``.

.. code-block:: js

   const newWriteConcern = WriteConcern.fromOptions(myDB);
   const myDoc = { name: "New Document" };
   WriteConcern.apply(myDoc,newWriteConcern);

Read Concern
------------

The read concern specifies the following behaviors:

- Level of :manual:`causal consistency </core/causal-consistency-read-write-concerns/>` across replica sets

- `Isolation guarantees
  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/current/core/read-isolation-consistency-recency/>`__ maintained during a query 

You can specify the read concern setting by using the ``level`` parameter. The default
read concern level is ``local``. This means that the client returns the data from the
replica set member that the client is connected to, with no guarantee that the data has
been written to all replica set members. Note that lower read concern level requirements
may reduce latency. 

For more information about read concerns or read concern levels, see 
:manual:`Read Concern </reference/read-concern/>` in the Server manual. For more detail on
the ``ReadConcern`` type and definitions of the read concern levels, see the `ReadConcern <{+api+}/classes/ReadConcern.html>`__ in
the API documentation.

Example: Set the Read Concern Level of an Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code sets the read concern level of an an aggregation to ``"majority"``:

.. code-block:: js

   const pipeline = [
      {"$match": {
        category: "KITCHENWARE",
      }},
      {"$unset": [
        "_id",
        "category",
      ]}
    ]; 
   
   result = await myDB.collection("mycollection")
      .aggregate(
        pipeline, 
        { readConcern: 
          { level: "available" } 
        } 
      );

For more information about aggregates, see the :ref:`nodejs-aggregation` page.
   
Example: Change the Read Concern of a Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code changes the read concern level of a database to ``"local"``:

.. code-block:: js

   const options = { readConcern: { level: "local" } };
   const myDB = client.db("mydb", options);

Read Preference
---------------

The read preference determines which member of a replica set MongoDB reads when running a
query. You can also customize how the server evaluates members. 

For more detailed API documentation, see the `ReadPreference API
documentation <{+api+}/classes/ReadPreference.html>`__.

The following table describes the ``ReadPreference`` parameters:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``mode``
     - :manual:`ReadPreferenceMode </core/read-preference/#read-preference-modes-1>`
     - Specifies a requirement or preference for which replica set
       member the server reads from. The default mode, ``primary``, specifies that
       operations read from the primary member of the replica set.

   * - ``tags`` *(optional)*
     - :manual:`TagSet List </core/read-preference-tags/#read-preference-tag-set-lists/>`
     - Assigns tags to secondary replica set members to customize how the server evaluates
       them. Tags cannot be used with the ``primary`` read preference mode setting.

   * - ``options`` *(optional)*
     - `ReadPreferenceOptions <{+api+}/interfaces/ReadPreferenceOptions.html>`__
     - Sets various options, including :manual:`hedge </core/read-preference-hedge-option/>`
       and :manual:`maxStalenessSeconds </core/read-preference-staleness/>` that can be
       applied to your read preference.

Example: Set Read Preference and Concerns for a Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code sets the read preference, read concern, and write concern for the operations in
a transaction:

.. code-block:: js

   const transactionOptions = {
      readPreference: "primary",
      readConcern: { level: "local" },
      writeConcern: { w: "majority" },
   };

   const session = client.startSession();
   session.startTransaction(transactionOptions);
   // ...
   await session.commitTransaction();
   await session.endSession();

For more information about transactions, see :ref:`nodejs-transactions`.

Example: Set the Read Preference of a Cluster in the Connection String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code example creates a MongoClient that uses the "secondary" read preference mode
when performing queries on a cluster:

.. code-block:: js

   const uri = "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>?readPreference=secondary&maxStalenessSeconds=120";
   const client = new MongoClient(uri);

This example also sets the ``maxStalenessSeconds`` option. For more information about connection string options, see the :manual:`Connection String Options </reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options>`
section in the manual.
