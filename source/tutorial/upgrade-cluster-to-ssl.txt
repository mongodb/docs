The MongoDB server supports listening for both TLS/SSL encrypted and
unencrypted connections on the same TCP port. This allows upgrades of
MongoDB clusters to use TLS/SSL encrypted connections. 

To upgrade from a MongoDB cluster using no TLS/SSL encryption to one
using *only* TLS/SSL encryption, use the following rolling upgrade
process:


#. For each node of a cluster, start the node with the option
   ``--sslMode`` set to ``allowSSL``. The ``--sslMode
   allowSSL <--sslMode>`` setting allows the node to accept both TLS/SSL
   and non-TLS/non-SSL incoming connections. Its connections to other servers
   do not use TLS/SSL. Include other :doc:`TLS/SSL options
   </tutorial/configure-ssl>` as well as any other options that are
   required for your specific configuration.
   
   .. note::

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/default-bind-ip-security.rst

   For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --replSet <name> --sslMode allowSSL --sslPEMKeyFile <path to TLS/SSL Certificate and key PEM file> --sslCAFile <path to root CA PEM file> <additional options>

   Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to these settings.

   You may also specify these options in the :doc:`configuration file
   </reference/configuration-options>`. If using a :doc:`YAML format
   configuration file </reference/configuration-options>`, include the
   following settings in the file:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      net:
         ssl:
            mode: <disabled|allowSSL|preferSSL|requireSSL>
            PEMKeyFile: <path to TLS/SSL certificate and key PEM file>
            CAFile: <path to root CA PEM file>


#. Switch all clients to use TLS/SSL. See :ref:`ssl-clients`.

#. For each node of a cluster, use the :dbcommand:`setParameter`
   command to update the :parameter:`sslMode` to ``preferSSL``.
   [#update-mode-alternative]_ With ``preferSSL`` as its
   :setting:`net.ssl.mode`, the node accepts both TLS/SSL and non-TLS/non-SSL incoming
   connections, and its connections to other servers use TLS/SSL. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.adminCommand( { setParameter: 1, sslMode: "preferSSL" } )

   Upgrade all nodes of the cluster to these settings.

   At this point, all connections should be using TLS/SSL.

#. For each node of the cluster, use the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command to update the :parameter:`sslMode`
   to ``requireSSL``. [#update-mode-alternative]_ With ``requireSSL``
   as its :setting:`net.ssl.mode`, the node will reject any non-TLS/non-SSL
   connections. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db.adminCommand( { setParameter: 1, sslMode: "requireSSL" } )

#. After the upgrade of all nodes, edit the :doc:`configuration file
   </reference/configuration-options>` with the appropriate TLS/SSL
   settings to ensure that upon subsequent restarts, the cluster uses
   TLS/SSL.

.. [#update-mode-alternative] As an alternative to using the
   :dbcommand:`setParameter` command, you can also
   restart the nodes with the appropriate TLS/SSL options and values.
