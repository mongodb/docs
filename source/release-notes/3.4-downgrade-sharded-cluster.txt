Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
of this document.

Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/3.4-downgrade-path.rst

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the feature
compatibility version and remove any :ref:`3.4 features incompatible
<3.4-compatibility-enabled>` with 3.2 or earlier versions as outlined
below. These steps are necessary only if
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has ever been set to ``"3.4"``.

.. |fcv| replace:: :ref:`Feature Compatibility Version to "3.2" <3.4-downgrade-feature-compatibility-sharded-cluster>`

.. |target| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance

.. _3.4-downgrade-feature-compatibility-sharded-cluster:

1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

#. .. include:: /includes/extracts/3.4-downgrade-feature-compatibility.rst

2. Remove Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have defined any views, drop the views before downgrading
MongoDB 3.4 to 3.2.

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

#. .. include:: /includes/extracts/3.4-downgrade-views.rst

3. Remove Collation Option from Collections and Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have defined any non-"simple" collation for a collection or an
index, remove the collection or index before downgrading MongoDB 3.4 to
3.2.

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

#. .. include:: /includes/extracts/3.4-downgrade-collation-collections.rst

#. .. include:: /includes/extracts/3.4-downgrade-collation-indexes.rst

4. Convert Data of Type Decimal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

#. .. include:: /includes/extracts/3.4-downgrade-decimal.rst

5. Downgrade Index Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have ``v: 2`` indexes (i.e. the default version for indexes
created in MongoDB 3.4 if ``featureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4"``),
:method:`reindex the collection <db.collection.reIndex()>` to recreate
all indexes on the collection as ``v: 1`` before downgrading MongoDB.

You must perform this operation on both the shards and the config
servers:

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

#. .. include:: /includes/extracts/3.4-downgrade-v2-indexes.rst

#. If a shard is a replica set, repeat this procedure on each member of
   the shard as the reindex operation does not propagate to the
   secondaries.

   .. tip::

      If connecting a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to a secondary member,
      set use :method:`db.getMongo().setReadPref('secondary')` to allow reads
      from secondaries.

#. Repeat the process on each member of the config server replica set.

Procedure
---------

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the downgrade is in progress, you cannot make changes to the
collection metadata. For example, during the downgrade, do
**not** do any of the following:

- :method:`sh.enableSharding()`

- :method:`sh.shardCollection()`

- :method:`sh.addShard()`

- :method:`db.createCollection()`

- :method:`db.collection.drop()`

- :method:`db.dropDatabase()`

- any operation that creates a database

- any other operation that modifies the cluster meta-data in any
  way. See :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list of
  sharding commands. Note, however, that not all commands on the
  :doc:`/reference/sharding` page modify the cluster meta-data.

Downgrade a Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |newversion| replace:: 3.4
.. |oldversion| replace:: 3.2
