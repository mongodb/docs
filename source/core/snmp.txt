Overview
--------

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet standard monitoring
protocol supported by MongoDB.

Running as Subagent
-------------------

MongoDB supports monitoring :program:`mongod` with SNMP. The
:program:`mongod` instance acts as an SNMP subagent that is monitored
through an SNMP master (for example ``snmpd``).

Running as Master
-----------------

In production deployments MongoDB is an SNMP subagent. An SNMP master such
as ``snmpd`` monitors the mongod instances. For testing and development only,
you can run MongoDB as an SNMP master.
