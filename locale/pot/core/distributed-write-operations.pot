msgid "For sharded collections in a :term:`sharded cluster`, the :program:`mongos` directs write operations from applications to the shards that are responsible for the specific *portion* of the data set. The :program:`mongos` uses the cluster metadata from the :ref:`config database <sharding-config-server>` to route the write operation to the appropriate shards."

msgid "MongoDB partitions data in a sharded collection into *ranges* based on the values of the :term:`shard key`. Then, MongoDB distributes these chunks to shards. The shard key determines the distribution of chunks to shards. This can affect the performance of write operations in the cluster."

msgid "Update operations that affect a *single* document **must** include the :term:`shard key` or the ``_id`` field. Updates that affect multiple documents are more efficient in some situations if they have the :term:`shard key`, but can be broadcast to all shards."

msgid "In :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, all write operations go to the set's :term:`primary`, which applies the write operation then records the operations on the primary's operation log or :term:`oplog`. The oplog is a reproducible sequence of operations to the data set. :term:`Secondary` members of the set are continuously replicating the oplog and applying the operations to themselves in an asynchronous process."

# 9f3437360fff4fcebd477eabc98e7482
msgid "Large volumes of write operations, particularly bulk operations, may create situations where the secondary members have difficulty applying the replicating operations from the primary at a sufficient rate: this can cause the secondary's state to fall behind that of the primary. Secondaries that are significantly behind the primary present problems for normal operation of the replica set, particularly :ref:`failover <replica-set-failover-administration>` in the form of :ref:`rollbacks <replica-set-rollback>` as well as general :doc:`read consistency </applications/replication>`."

msgid "To help avoid this issue, you can customize the :ref:`write concern <write-operations-write-concern>` to return confirmation of the write operation to another member [#write-concern-throttling]_ of the replica set every 100 or 1,000 operations. This provides an opportunity for secondaries to catch up with the primary. Write concern can slow the overall progress of write operations but ensure that the secondaries can maintain a largely current state with respect to the primary."
