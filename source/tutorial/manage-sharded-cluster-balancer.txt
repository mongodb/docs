Manage Sharded Cluster Balancer
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This page describes common administrative procedures related
to balancing. For an introduction to balancing, see
:ref:`sharding-balancing`. For lower level information on balancing, see
:ref:`sharding-balancing-internals`.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/configure-sharded-cluster-balancer`

Check the Balancer State
------------------------

The following command checks if the balancer is enabled (i.e. that the
balancer is allowed to run). The command does not check if the balancer
is active (i.e. if it is actively balancing chunks).

To see if the balancer is enabled in your :term:`cluster <sharded
cluster>`, issue the following command, which returns a boolean:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.getBalancerState()

.. _sharding-balancing-check-lock:

Check the Balancer Lock
-----------------------

To see if the balancer process is active in your :term:`cluster
<sharded cluster>`, do the following:

#. Connect to any :program:`mongos` in the cluster using the
   :program:`mongo` shell.

#. Issue the following command to switch to the :ref:`config-database`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config

#. Use the following query to return the balancer lock:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.locks.find( { _id : "balancer" } ).pretty()

When this command returns, you will see output like the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "_id" : "balancer",
   "process" : "mongos0.example.net:1292810611:1804289383",
     "state" : 2,
        "ts" : ObjectId("4d0f872630c42d1978be8a2e"),
      "when" : "Mon Dec 20 2010 11:41:10 GMT-0500 (EST)",
       "who" : "mongos0.example.net:1292810611:1804289383:Balancer:846930886",
       "why" : "doing balance round" }

This output confirms that:

- The balancer originates from the :program:`mongos` running on the
  system with the hostname ``mongos0.example.net``.

- The value in the ``state`` field indicates that a :program:`mongos`
  has the lock. For version 2.0 and later, the value of an active lock
  is ``2``; for earlier versions the value is ``1``.

.. _sharding-schedule-balancing-window:

Schedule the Balancing Window
-----------------------------

In some situations, particularly when your data set grows slowly and a
migration can impact performance, it's useful to be able to ensure
that the balancer is active only at certain times.  Use the following
procedure to specify a window during which the :term:`balancer` will
be able to migrate chunks:

#. Connect to any :program:`mongos` in the cluster using the
   :program:`mongo` shell.

#. Issue the following command to switch to the :ref:`config-database`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config

#. Issue the following operation to ensure the balancer is not in the
   ``stopped`` state:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sh.setBalancerState( true )

   The balancer will not activate if in the ``stopped`` state or
   outside the ``activeWindow`` timeframe.

#. Use an operation modeled on the following example :method:`update()
   <db.collection.update()>` operation to modify the balancer's
   window:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.settings.update({ _id : "balancer" }, { $set : { activeWindow : { start : "<start-time>", stop : "<stop-time>" } } }, true )

   Replace ``<start-time>`` and ``<end-time>`` with time values using
   two digit hour and minute values (e.g ``HH:MM``) that describe the
   beginning and end boundaries of the balancing window.
   These times will be evaluated relative to the time zone of each individual
   :program:`mongos` instance in the sharded cluster.
   If your :program:`mongos` instances are physically located in different
   time zones, use a common time zone (e.g. GMT) to ensure that the
   balancer window is interpreted correctly.

   For instance, running the following
   will force the balancer to run between 11PM and 6AM local time only:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.settings.update({ _id : "balancer" }, { $set : { activeWindow : { start : "23:00", stop : "6:00" } } }, true )

.. note::

   The balancer window must be sufficient to *complete* the migration
   of all data inserted during the day.

   As data insert rates can change based on activity and usage
   patterns, it is important to ensure that the balancing window you
   select will be sufficient to support the needs of your deployment.

   Do not use the :method:`sh.startBalancer()` method when you have set an
   ``activeWindow``.

.. _sharding-balancing-remove-window:

Remove a Balancing Window Schedule
----------------------------------

If you have :ref:`set the balancing window
<sharding-schedule-balancing-window>` and wish to remove the schedule
so that the balancer is always running, issue the following sequence
of operations:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use config
   db.settings.update({ _id : "balancer" }, { $unset : { activeWindow : true } })

.. _sharding-balancing-disable-temporally:
.. _sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily:

Disable the Balancer
--------------------

By default the balancer may run at any time and only moves chunks as
needed. To disable the balancer for a short period of time and prevent
all migration, use the following procedure:

#. Connect to any :program:`mongos` in the cluster using the
   :program:`mongo` shell.

#. Issue the following operation to disable the balancer:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.stopBalancer()

   If a migration is in progress, the system will complete the
   in-progress migration before stopping.

#. To verify that the balancer will not start, issue the following command,
   which returns ``false`` if the balancer is disabled:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.getBalancerState()

   Optionally, to verify no migrations are in progress after disabling,
   issue the following operation in the :program:`mongo` shell:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config
      while( sh.isBalancerRunning() ) {
                print("waiting...");
                sleep(1000);
      }

.. note::

   To disable the balancer from a driver that does not have the
   :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` or :method:`sh.setBalancerState()` helpers,
   issue the following command from the ``config`` database:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.settings.update( { _id: "balancer" }, { $set : { stopped: true } } , true )

.. _sharding-balancing-re-enable:
.. _sharding-balancing-enable:

Enable the Balancer
-------------------

Use this procedure if you have disabled the balancer and are ready to
re-enable it:

#. Connect to any :program:`mongos` in the cluster using the
   :program:`mongo` shell.

#. Issue one of the following operations to enable the balancer:

   From the :program:`mongo` shell, issue:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.setBalancerState(true)

   From a driver that does not have the :method:`sh.startBalancer()` helper,
   issue the following from the ``config`` database:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.settings.update( { _id: "balancer" }, { $set : { stopped: false } } , true )

Disable Balancing During Backups
--------------------------------

If MongoDB migrates a :term:`chunk` during a :doc:`backup
</core/backups>`, you can end with an inconsistent snapshot
of your :term:`sharded cluster`. Never run a backup while the balancer is
active. To ensure that the balancer is inactive during your backup
operation:

- Set the :ref:`balancing window <sharding-schedule-balancing-window>`
  so that the balancer is inactive during the backup. Ensure that the
  backup can complete while you have the balancer disabled.

- :ref:`manually disable the balancer <sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily>`
  for the duration of the backup procedure.

If you turn the balancer off while it is in the middle of a balancing round,
the shut down is not instantaneous. The balancer completes the chunk
move in-progress and then ceases all further balancing rounds.

Before starting a backup operation, confirm that the balancer is not
active. You can use the following command to determine if the balancer
is active:

.. code-block:: javascript

   !sh.getBalancerState() && !sh.isBalancerRunning()

When the backup procedure is complete you can reactivate
the balancer process.

Disable Balancing on a Collection
---------------------------------

You can disable balancing for a specific collection with the
:method:`sh.disableBalancing()` method. You may want to disable the
balancer for a specific collection to support maintenance operations or
atypical workloads, for example, during data ingestions or data exports.

When you disable balancing on a collection, MongoDB will not interrupt in
progress migrations.

To disable balancing on a collection, connect to a :program:`mongos`
with the :program:`mongo` shell and call the
:method:`sh.disableBalancing()` method.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.disableBalancing("students.grades")

The :method:`sh.disableBalancing()` method accepts as its parameter the
full :term:`namespace` of the collection.

Enable Balancing on a Collection
--------------------------------

You can enable balancing for a specific collection with the
:method:`sh.enableBalancing()` method.

When you enable balancing for a collection, MongoDB will not *immediately*
begin balancing data. However, if the data in your sharded collection is
not balanced, MongoDB will be able to begin distributing the data more
evenly.

To enable balancing on a collection, connect to a :program:`mongos`
with the :program:`mongo` shell and call the
:method:`sh.enableBalancing()` method.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.enableBalancing("students.grades")

The :method:`sh.enableBalancing()` method accepts as its parameter the
full :term:`namespace` of the collection.

Confirm Balancing is Enabled or Disabled
----------------------------------------

To confirm whether balancing for a collection is enabled or disabled,
query the ``collections`` collection in the ``config`` database for the
collection :term:`namespace` and check the ``noBalance`` field. For
example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("config").collections.findOne({_id : "students.grades"}).noBalance;

This operation will return a null error, ``true``, ``false``, or no output:

- A null error indicates the collection namespace is incorrect.

- If the result is ``true``, balancing is disabled.

- If the result is ``false``, balancing is enabled currently but has been
  disabled in the past for the collection. Balancing of this collection
  will begin the next time the balancer runs.

- If the operation returns no output, balancing is enabled currently and
  has never been disabled in the past for this collection. Balancing of
  this collection will begin the next time the balancer runs.
