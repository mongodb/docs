Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to use the {+driver-short+} to monitor topology
events in a MongoDB instance, replica set, or sharded cluster. The
driver creates topology events, also known as Server Discovery and
Monitoring (SDAM) events, when there are any changes in the state of the
instance or cluster that you are connected to. 

You can use information about topology changes in your
application, or you can monitor cluster changes to learn more about
how they affect your application.

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Event Descriptions <rust-cluster-monitoring-descriptions>` describes
  the SDAM events that the driver can generate.

- :ref:`Event Subscription Example <rust-cluster-monitoring-example>`
  provides sample code that shows how to subscribe to SDAM events.

- :ref:`Example Event Documents <rust-cluster-monitoring-documents>`
  provides samples of each SDAM event.
  
- :ref:`Additional Information <rust-cluster-addtl-info>`
  provides links to resources and API documentation for types
  and methods mentioned in this guide.

Event Descriptions
------------------

You can monitor the following SDAM events:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 67 
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Event Name
     - Description

   * - `ServerDescriptionChangedEvent <{+api+}/event/sdam/struct.ServerDescriptionChangedEvent.html>`__
     - Created when an instance state changes, such as when a replica set
       member changes from a secondary to a primary.

   * - `ServerOpeningEvent <{+api+}/event/sdam/struct.ServerOpeningEvent.html>`__
     - Created when a connection to an instance, such as a replica set member, opens.

   * - `ServerClosedEvent <{+api+}/event/sdam/struct.ServerClosedEvent.html>`__
     - Created when a connection to an instance, such as a replica set member, closes.

   * - `TopologyDescriptionChangedEvent <{+api+}/event/sdam/struct.TopologyDescriptionChangedEvent.html>`__
     - Created when the topology description changes, such as when there
       is an election of a new primary or when a ``mongos`` proxy disconnects.

   * - `TopologyOpeningEvent <{+api+}/event/sdam/struct.TopologyOpeningEvent.html>`__
     - Created before the driver attempts to connect to an instance.

   * - `TopologyClosedEvent <{+api+}/event/sdam/struct.TopologyClosedEvent.html>`__
     - Created after all instance connections in the topology close.

   * - `ServerHeartbeatStartedEvent <{+api+}/event/sdam/struct.ServerHeartbeatStartedEvent.html>`__
     - Created before the driver issues a ``hello`` command to an instance.

   * - `ServerHeartbeatSucceededEvent <{+api+}/event/sdam/struct.ServerHeartbeatSucceededEvent.html>`__
     - Created when the ``hello`` command returns successfully from a
       MongoDB instance.

   * - `ServerHeartbeatFailedEvent <{+api+}/event/sdam/struct.ServerHeartbeatFailedEvent.html>`__
     - Created when a ``hello`` command to a MongoDB instance does not
       return a successful response.

.. _rust-cluster-monitoring-example:

Event Monitoring Example
------------------------

You can monitor SDAM events by assigning an ``EventHandler`` instance as the value of the
``sdam_event_handler`` client option. To construct an ``EventHandler``, which processes all
SDAM events, use the ``callback()`` or ``async_callback()`` method.

The following example connects to a MongoDB deployment, instructs the client to monitor
SDAM events, and prints each event:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/monitoring/sdam-subscribe.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-sdam
   :end-before: end-sdam
