  When choosing your :guilabel:`Security Group`, it is important that
  the ports you use for your deployment are open within the security
  group. It is also required that the security group allow SSH access
  from all IPs.

  The security groups populated here come directly from your AWS
  account. If you would like a new group listed in this menu, you must
  create it in the AWS console. It cannot be created in MMS.

  on the provisioned machines.

  When you complete your entries, click :guilabel:`Provision Machine`.

  The machines can take several minutes to become fully operational.
