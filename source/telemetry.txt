``mongosh`` collects anonymous aggregated usage data to improve
MongoDB products. ``mongosh`` collects this information by default, but
you can disable this data collection at any time.

Data Tracked by ``mongosh``
---------------------------

``mongosh`` tracks the following data:

- The type of MongoDB ``mongosh`` is connected to. For example,
  Enterprise Edition, Community Edition, or Atlas Data Lake.

- The methods run in ``mongosh``. ``mongosh`` only tracks the names of
  the methods, and does not track any arguments supplied to methods.

- Whether users run scripts with ``mongosh``.

- Errors.

``mongosh`` *does not* track:

- IP addresses, hostnames, usernames, or credentials.

- Queries run in ``mongosh``.

- Any data stored in your MongoDB deployment.

- Personal identifiable information.

<https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy-policy?tck=docs_mongosh>`__.

Toggle Telemetry Collection
---------------------------

Use the following methods in ``mongosh`` to toggle telemetry data
collection.

.. method:: disableTelemetry()

   Disable telemetry for ``mongosh``.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      disableTelemetry()

   The command response confirms that telemetry is disabled:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      Telemetry is now disabled.

   .. tip::

      You can also disable telemetry at startup by using the
      :option:`--eval <--eval>` startup option.
      
      The following command starts ``mongosh`` with telemetry disabled:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         mongosh --nodb --eval "disableTelemetry()"

.. method:: enableTelemetry()

   Enable telemetry for ``mongosh``.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      enableTelemetry()

   The command response confirms that telemetry is enabled:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      Telemetry is now enabled.
