In order to maintain up-to-date copies of the shared data set, members
of a replica set :term:`sync` or replicate data from other
members. MongoDB uses two forms of data synchronization: :ref:`initial
sync <replica-set-initial-sync>` to populate new members with the full
data set, and replication to apply ongoing changes to the entire
data set.

.. _replica-set-initial-sync:

Initial Sync
------------

Initial sync copies all the data from one member of the replica set to
another member. A member uses initial sync when the member has no data,
such as when the member is new, or when the member has data but is
missing a history of the set's replication.

When you perform an initial sync, MongoDB:

#. Clones all databases. To clone, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` queries every
   collection in each source database and inserts all data into its
   own copies of these collections.  At this time, ``_id`` indexes are
   also built. The clone process only copies valid data, omitting
   invalid documents.

#. Applies all changes to the data set. Using the oplog from the
   source, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` updates its data set to reflect the
   current state of the replica set.

#. Builds all indexes on all collections (except ``_id`` indexes,
   which were already completed).

   When the :binary:`~bin.mongod` finishes building all index builds, the member
   can transition to a normal state, i.e. :term:`secondary`.

.. versionchanged:: 3.0
   When the clone process omits an invalid document from the sync,
   MongoDB writes a message to the logs that begins with ``Cloner:
   found corrupt document in <collection>``.

To perform an initial sync, see
:doc:`/tutorial/resync-replica-set-member`.

.. _replica-set-replication:

Replication
-----------

Replica set members replicate data continuously after the initial
sync. This process keeps the members up to date with all changes to
the replica set's data. In most cases, secondaries synchronize from
the primary. Secondaries may automatically change their *sync targets*
if needed based on changes in the ping time and state of other members'
replication.

Secondaries avoid syncing from
:ref:`delayed members <replica-set-delayed-members>` and :ref:`hidden
members <replica-set-hidden-members>`.

If a secondary member has
:data:`~replSetGetConfig.members[n].buildIndexes` set to ``true``, it
can only sync from other members where
::data:`~replSetGetConfig.members[n].buildIndexes` is ``true``. Members
where ::data:`~replSetGetConfig.members[n].buildIndexes` is ``false``
can sync from any other member, barring other sync restrictions.
::data:`~replSetGetConfig.members[n].buildIndexes` is ``true`` by default.

Validity and Durability
-----------------------

In a replica set, the set can have at most one primary and only the
primary can accept write operations. [#edge-cases-2-primaries]_
Secondaries apply operations from the primary asynchronously to provide
:term:`eventual consistency`.

:term:`Journaling <journal>` provides single-instance write durability.
Without journaling, if a MongoDB instance terminates
ungracefully, you must assume that the database is in an invalid state.

In MongoDB, clients can see the results of writes before they are made
durable:

.. _replica-set-internals-multi-threaded-replication:

Multithreaded Replication
-------------------------

MongoDB applies write operations in batches using multiple threads to
improve concurrency. MongoDB groups batches by namespace (:ref:`MMAPv1
<storage-mmapv1>`) or by document id (:ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>`) and simultaneously applies each group of
operations using a different thread. MongoDB always applies write
operations to a given document in their original write order.

While applying a batch, MongoDB blocks all read operations. As a
result, secondary read queries can never return data that reflect a
state that never existed on the primary.

Pre-Fetching Indexes to Improve Replication Throughput
------------------------------------------------------

.. note::
   Applies to MMAPv1 only.

With the :ref:`MMAPv1 <storage-mmapv1>` storage engine, MongoDB fetches
memory pages that hold affected data and indexes to help improve the
performance of applying oplog entries. This *pre-fetch* stage minimizes
the amount of time MongoDB holds write locks while applying oplog
entries. By default, secondaries will pre-fetch all :ref:`indexes`.

Optionally, you can disable all pre-fetching or only pre-fetch
the index on the ``_id`` field. See the :setting:`~replication.secondaryIndexPrefetch`
setting for more information.
