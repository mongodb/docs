Dashboards are a collection of charts assembled to create a single
unified display of your data. Each chart shows data from a
single MongoDB collection or view, so dashboards are essential to
attain insight into multiple focal points of your data in a single
display. Dashboards can be shared with other users.

Dashboards Page
---------------

The :guilabel:`Dashboards` page shows all dashboards you have access to
view. To learn more about dashboard permissions in |charts|, see
:ref:`Dashboard Permissions <dashboard-permissions>`.

.. figure:: /images/charts/charts-dashboard-landing.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Charts Dashboard Tab

Each dashboard shows the following information:

- Title

- Description

- A preview of the first three charts in the dashboard, including the
  chart title and type

- When the dashboard was last modified

By default, the most recently modified dashboards are shown first in
the list. You can change the sort order by using the
:guilabel:`Sort By` dropdown menu.

.. _create-new-dashboard:

.. _sample-dashboard:

Sample Dashboard
----------------

|charts| provides a :guilabel:`Sample Dashboard` that uses movie
data to show examples of possible charts you can create. You can access the
:guilabel:`Sample Dashboard` by going through the |charts-short|
:ref:`Welcome Experience <welcome-experience>`, or adding it through the
:ref:`Charts Settings <admin-settings>` page. 

.. note::

   If you remove the :guilabel:`Sample Dashboard`, you can add it back through your
   :ref:`Charts Settings <admin-settings>` page.

Sample Dashboard Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Sample Dashboard` comes with default filters for
:guilabel:`Genres` and :guilabel:`Year of Release`. You can adjust these
filters to modify the data that appears on your dashboard. To learn more
about filtering dashboard data, see :ref:`dashboard-filtering`. 

.. _refresh-dashboard-overview:

Refresh Dashboard Data
----------------------

|charts| automatically refreshes chart data once it becomes out of
date with the backing data source. You can also manually refresh
dashboard data at any time.

To learn how to configure auto refresh settings and underlying
refresh behavior, see :doc:`/dashboard-refresh`.

.. _get-chart-data-dashboard:

Get Chart Data
--------------

Authenticated dashboard users can view and export the
underlying chart data as a table. To view the chart data, click 
:guilabel:`Get Chart Data` from the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` menu. Each
row in the table represents a data point.

.. note::

   Users who open a dashboard using a public link can't get chart data.

.. include:: /includes/get-chart-data-details.rst

.. _import-export-dashboard:

Export and Import a Dashboard 
-----------------------------

You can export a dashboard to a file, which you can then import. Use 
this feature to:

- Store your dashboard outside of |charts|
- Import exported charts into the same or a different project

.. _export-dashboard:

Export a Dashboard to a File 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can export a dashboard to a single file named 
``<Dashboard-Title>.charts`` on the :ref:`Dashboards page 
<dashboards-tab>`. The file contains the metadata for the dashboard, 
including:

- Dashboard name and description
- Dashboard layout including location of the charts in the dashboard 
- Chart definitions
- Dashboard filter definitions
- Details of the data sources used on the charts including:

  - Cluster name
  - Database name
  - Collection name 

- Embedding settings for each chart including:

  - Whether each embedding type is enabled or disabled
  - Filter allow list
  - Injected filter code 

The file **doesn't** include: 

- Dashboard :ref:`permissions <dashboard-permissions>`
- External sharing settings for the data sources used
- Data source pipelines
- Chart embedding IDs

You must have ``Viewer`` or higher :ref:`permissions 
<dashboard-permissions>` to export a dashboard.

From the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page: 

1. Click the ellipsis (``...``) for the dashboard you want to export 
   and select :guilabel:`Export Dashboard` from the dropdown.

#. Follow the browser prompts to download the file.

.. _import-dashboard:

Import a Dashboard From a File 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can import a dashboard from a file on the :ref:`Dashboards page 
<dashboards-tab>`. The file to import: 

- Can't be larger than 16 MBs
- Must be a valid ``.charts`` file that you downloaded from a 
  dashboard

From the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page:

1. Click the :guilabel:`Add Dashboard` dropdown and select 
   :guilabel:`Import Dashboard` to display the :guilabel:`Import 
   Dashboard` modal.

#. Drag and drop the file to import or click :guilabel:`Choose File` 
   and select the file to import.

#. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

#. Select the data source for the dashboard from the :guilabel:`Data 
   source at destination` dropdown. 
   
   The :guilabel:`Import Dashboard` modal displays a list of all the 
   data sources used by the file being imported under :guilabel:`Data 
   source in file` column. For each data source in the file, select a 
   :guilabel:`Data source at destination`: 

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 40  

      * - Option 
        - Description 

      * - <Mapped Data Source>
        - Option to select any data source in your project. The data 
          source you select is used instead of the :guilabel:`Data 
          source in file` for charts imported in to the dashboard.
   
      * - :guilabel:`Connect later`
        - Option to choose the data source to use later. |charts| 
          imports all charts using the :guilabel:`Data source in file`, 
          but no data source is selected. The charts don't render until 
          you edit each chart and choose a new data source.

      * - :guilabel:`Exclude charts using this data source`
        - Option to exclude charts that use the :guilabel:`Data source 
          in file`. Charts that use the :guilabel:`Data source in 
          file` won't be imported.

   If |charts| detects that a data source in your project is the same 
   as the data source in the file, that data source is selected by 
   default. Otherwise, :guilabel:`Connect later` is selected by default.

   .. important::

      Imported charts may not render properly if mapped to a data 
      source that the chart wasn't built to use.

#. Click one of these buttons: 

   - :guilabel:`Save` to import the dashboard. 
   - :guilabel:`Save and Import Another` to import this dashboard and 
     import another dashboard from a file.
   - :guilabel:`Cancel` to exit the modal without importing the 
     dashboard.

.. _fullscreen-view:

Fullscreen View
---------------

|charts| provides a fullscreen view for dashboards. In this view,
|charts| hides the main navigation bar and expands the dashboard to
show the title, description, time of last modification, and charts in
the entire space of the screen.

To open a dashboard in fullscreen view, first select a dashboard from
the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page, then click the expanding arrows at the
top-right of the dashboard:

.. figure:: /images/charts/full-screen-view.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Fullscreen Arrows

.. note::

   You can still :ref:`remove <dashboard-remove-chart>`, :ref:`resize
   <dashboard-resize-chart>`, :ref:`rearrange
   <dashboard-rearrange-chart>`, and :ref:`access editing
   <dashboard-edit-chart>` for charts in fullscreen view by hovering
   over the desired chart.

   Additionally, in fullscreen view you can still configure
   auto-refresh settings and manually refresh chart data.

To exit fullscreen view, either click the contracting arrows at the
top-right of the dashboard or press the escape key.
