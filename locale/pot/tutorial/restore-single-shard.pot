msgid "Always restore :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` as a whole. When you restore a single shard, keep in mind that the :term:`balancer` process might have moved :term:`chunks <chunk>` to or from this shard since the last backup. If that's the case, you must manually move those chunks, as described in this procedure."
