Description
-----------

At time ``T``, no :term:`primary` was detected in replica set ``ABC``.

Common Triggers
---------------

- The workload exceeds the cluster's throughput limits and compute 
  resources.

- A network issue with the cloud provider is preventing :manual:`voting
  members </core/replica-set-elections>` of the replica set from
  communicating with each other, such that a primary cannot be elected.

Possible Solutions
------------------

- Check the cluster's :doc:`metrics 
  </monitor-cluster-metrics>` to determine if there are 
  sufficient compute resources for your workload.

  - If the cluster is exhausting CPU, disk IOPS, connections, or other
    resources, :doc:`upgrade </scale-cluster>` to a cluster that supports your workload.

  - If the cluster's metrics are normal, there could be a network issue
    with the cloud provider. |service| automatically attempts to repair
    these issues. If the problem persists, `contact MongoDB Support
    <https://www.mongodb.com/contact>`__.
