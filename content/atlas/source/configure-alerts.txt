   Required Access
   ---------------

   To manage all organization alerts, you must have the 
   :authrole:`Organization Owner` role for the organization.

   The :authrole:`Organization Billing Admin` role grants a 
   limited authorization to manage billing alerts.

   To manage project alerts, you must have 
   :authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project. Users with 
   :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves to the project 
   as a ``Project Owner``.

   View Alert Configurations
   -------------------------

   You can configure :ref:`maintenance-window-alerts` for projects. These alerts
   are effective only for projects with an active :ref:`maintenance window
   configured <atlas-modify-project-settings>`. If you don't configure a maintenance
   window, you can create a maintenance window alert but maintenance tasks will not
   trigger the alert.

   .. selected-content::
      :selections: atlas-ui, project-alert

      You can view open alerts, closed alerts, and alert 
      settings on the :guilabel:`Project Alerts` page. 
      |service| sends notifications for all alerts 
      that appear on the :guilabel:`Open` tab. To learn more, 
      see :ref:`alerts-workflow`.
