.. _server-pool-servers:

:guilabel:`Servers` page
------------------------

The :guilabel:`Servers` tab allows Administators to view information
regarding servers in the pool, such as availability, as well as cancel
pending requests and recycle servers that have been terminated but
*not* returned to the pool. The :guilabel:`Servers` tab provides three
views:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - View
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Server List`

     - Lists servers in the pool and their availability (i.e. whether
       they are bound to a specific |mms| group or unbound). From this
       list, Administrators can terminate unbound servers.

       For servers bound to a group, owners of the group can terminate
       the servers from their :guilabel:`Deployment` view.

   * - :guilabel:`Pending Requests`
     - Lists the pending :doc:`requests
       </tutorial/request-servers-from-pool>`. Administrator can cancel
       pending requests from this view.

   * - :guilabel:`Recycle Bin`

     - Lists terminated servers that have not been returned to the
       pool. From this view, Administrator can recycle terminated
       servers to return them to the pool.

       If the list of terminated servers exceed the list displayed on
       the current page, :guilabel:`Recycle All` recycles *all*
       terminated servers in the recycle bin, not just the servers
       displayed on the current page.

.. _server-pool-server-request-options:

:guilabel:`Servers Request Options` page
----------------------------------------

The :guilabel:`Servers Request Options` tab allows Administrators to
control which server options are displayed to the users when users make
a server request. These options are the properties and values specified
in the :asetting:`serverPoolPropertiesFile` file.

.. seealso:: :ref:`server-pool-manager-server-request-options`

.. _server-pool-agent-configuration:

:guilabel:`Agent Configuration` page
------------------------------------

The :guilabel:`Agent Configuration` tab displays the
:asetting:`serverPoolKey` needed to configure the {+aagent+} for
a server to be added to the server pool.
