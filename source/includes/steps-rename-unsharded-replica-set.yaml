  Perform the following steps for each replica set member:
  
  #. Update the replica set name in the 
     :ref:`configuration file <conf-file>` or adjust the 
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` startup command if not using a 
     configuration file.
  
  #. Start the replica set member on a different port without the
     :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option. 
  
  #. Connect to the replica set member. 
 
  #. Update the replica set name in the :ref:`local database 
     <replica-set-local-database>` with the following commands:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        /* Set `newId` to the new replica set name */
        var newId = '<new replica set name>'

        var doc = db.getSiblingDB("local").system.replset.findOne()
        var oldId = doc._id
        doc._id = newId
        db.getSiblingDB("local").system.replset.save(doc)
        db.getSiblingDB("local").system.replset.remove({_id: oldId})

  #. :ref:`Shut down <terminate-mongod-processes>` the replica set 
     member.
 
  #. Start the replica set member on its original port. If using a 
     configuration file, ensure the :setting:`replica set name 
     <replication.replSetName>` is set to the new name. Otherwise, 
     use the :binary:`~bin.mongod` startup command with the 
     :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option set to the new 
     replica set name.
