Plan and design your schema early in the development process.
This helps prevent performance issues as your application grows.

MongoDB's flexible schema allows you to design your schema iteratively.
However, it can still be difficult to modify large-scale schemas that 
are used in production. Depending on your application, you may want 
to establish a simple schema to cover basic functionality before optimizing.
