  Toggle :guilabel:`System Log Rotation` to :guilabel:`ON` to rotate server
  logs.

  .. COMMENT: Remove condition for the following upon OM 6.0 release:
  
  .. cond:: cloud

     MongoDB Enterprise users running MongoDB Enterprise version 5.0 or later and 
     {+mdbagent+} {+mdbagent-version-cloud+} and later can also toggle
     :guilabel:`Audit Log Rotation` to :guilabel:`ON`
     to rotate audit logs and configure audit log rotation separately.

     If you're running earlier versions of MongoDB Enterprise or the {+mdbagent+},
     setting :guilabel:`System Log Rotation` to :guilabel:`ON` also rotates audit logs.

  Set log rotation to :guilabel:`OFF` if you don't want |mms| to rotate its
  logs. Log rotation is :guilabel:`OFF` by default. 

  After you enable log rotation, |mms| displays additional log rotation settings.

  |mms| rotates the logs on your MongoDB hosts per the following
  settings:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 10 50 10
     :stub-columns: 1
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Field
       - Necessity
       - Action
       - Default

     * - :guilabel:`Size Threshold (MB)`
       - Required
       - |mms| rotates log files that exceed this maximum log file
         size.
       - ``1000``

     * - :guilabel:`Time Threshold (Hours)`
       - Required
       - |mms| rotates logs that exceed this duration.
       - ``24``

     * - :guilabel:`Max Uncompressed Files`
       - Optional
       - Log files can remain uncompressed until they exceed this
         number of files. |mms| compresses the oldest log files first.

         If you leave this setting empty, |mms| will use the default 
         of ``5``.

       - ``5``

     * - :guilabel:`Max Percent of Disk`
       - Optional
       - Log files can take up to this percent of disk space on your
         MongoDB host's log volume. |mms| deletes the oldest log files
         once they exceed this disk threshold.

         If you leave this setting empty, |mms| will use the default of
         ``2%``.

       - ``2%``

     * - :guilabel:`Total Number of Files`
       - Optional
       - Total number of log files. If a number is not specified, the
         total number of log files defaults to ``0`` and is determined
         by other :guilabel:`Rotate Logs` settings.
       - ``0``


  When you are done, click :guilabel:`Save` to review your changes.
