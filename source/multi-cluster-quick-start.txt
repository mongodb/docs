Use the quick start to deploy a MongoDB replica set across three |k8s|
member clusters, using |gke| and |istio| service mesh.

Before you begin:

- Learn about :ref:`multi-Kubernetes-cluster deployments <multi-cluster-overview-ref>`
- Review the list of :ref:`multi-Kubernetes-cluster services and tools <multi-cluster-services-tools-ref>`
- Complete the :ref:`prerequisites <multi-cluster-prereqs>`

.. note::

   The following procedures scope your |multi-cluster| to a single
   |k8s-ns| named ``mongodb``. You can configure your |multi-cluster| to
   watch resources in :ref:`multiple namespaces <mc-cluster-many-namespaces-ref>`
   or :ref:`all namespaces <mc-cluster-all-namespaces-ref>`.

.. _multi-cluster-tls-overview:

Deploy a MongoDBMultiCluster Resource
--------------------------------------

Select the appropriate tab based on whether you want to encrypt replica
set connections in your |multi-clusters| using |tls| certificates.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: With TLS-Encrypted Connections
      :tabid: encrypted

      You can use the following procedures in this
      :guilabel:`TLS-Encrypted Connections` tab:

      - Deploy a |mongodb-multi|
      - Renew TLS Certificates for a |mongodb-multi|

      These procedures establish |tls|-encrypted connections between
      MongoDB hosts in a replica set, and between client applications and
      MongoDB deployments.
  
      Before you begin, you must have valid certificates for |tls| encryption.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/multi-cluster-quick-start-tls.rst

      Renew TLS Certificates for a MongoDBMultiCluster Resource
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Renew your |tls| certificates periodically using the following procedure.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-k8s-multi-cluster-rs-tls-custom-renew.rst

   .. tab:: With Non-Encrypted Connections
      :tabid: non-encrypted

      This procedure doesn't encrypt connections between MongoDB hosts in
      a replica set, and between client applications and MongoDB deployments.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/multi-cluster-quick-start.rst

Next Steps
----------

After deploying your MongoDB replica set across three |k8s|
member clusters, you can add a database user so you can connect to your MongoDB database. 
See :ref:`k8s-manage-db-users`.
