For staging and production environments, we
recommend that you enable encryption with customer key management when you provision your {+clusters+}.
For development and testing, consider skipping encryption with customer key management 
to save costs, unless you're in a highly-regulated industry
or storing sensitive data. To learn more, see :ref:`arch-center-orgs-projects-clusters-recs`.
