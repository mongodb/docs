title: "Connect to the mongos"
level: 4
stepnum: 1
ref: connect-mongos
pre: |
  Connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.
action:
  - pre: |
      Using :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, use the ``--hostname`` parameter 
      passing the hostname of the target machine, and the ``--port`` 
      parameter passing the port the :binary:`~bin.mongos` listens on.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      mongosh --host <hostname> --port <port>
  - pre: |
      If your cluster enforces :term:`authentication`, add the 
      ``--username``, ``-password``, and ``--authenticationDatabase`` 
      parameters when connecting to the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.
      
      The username and password *must* be associated to a user created
      on the ``admin`` database with sufficient privileges to perform
      sharding operations. See the :ref:`sharding-collection-ranged-security`
      considerations for this tutorial.
      
      The following connects to a secured :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, 
      authenticating to the ``admin`` database.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      mongosh --host <hostname> --port <port> --username <user> --password <pass> --authenticationDatabase 'admin'

title: "Determine the Shard Key"
level: 4
ref: select-shard-key
pre: |
  Determine your :term:`shard key`. Your selection of shard key affects the
  efficiency of sharding. See the selection considerations listed under
  :ref:`sharding-shard-key-selection`

  .. note::

     - Starting in MongoDB 5.0, you can :ref:`reshard a collection
       <sharding-resharding>` by changing a document's shard key.
     - You can :ref:`refine a shard key <shard-key-refine>` by adding a suffix 
       field or fields to the existing shard key.

title: "Create the Shard Key Index"
level: 4
ref: create-shard-key
pre: |
  If the collection already contains data, you must create an index on the
  :term:`shard key` using the :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` method.

  If the collection is empty, then MongoDB creates the index as part of
  the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method.
---
title: "Shard the Collection"
level: 4
ref: shard-collection
pre: |
  Shard a collection by issuing the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method.
action:
  - pre: |
      The :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method takes the full namespace of
      the collection in ``<database>.<collection>`` format, and a document
      containing the shard key pattern.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.shardCollection( "<database>.<collection>", { <shard key> : <direction> } )
