   :keywords: |data-lake| Region

You can change the |aws| region through which your |data-lake| 
requests are routed. By default, |data-lake| requests are routed 
through the region that is closest to you. The region that is closest to you may
be different from the regions that house your data stores.

.. note::

   If you change the |aws| region through which your |data-lake| requests are 
   routed, you must update your |data-lake| connection string with the new 
   hostname. This change ensures that your requests are routed through the new 
   region.

Procedure
---------

To change the |aws| region through which your |data-lake| requests are routed, 
do the following in the |service| UI:
