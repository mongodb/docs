.. dbcommand:: serverStatus

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns a document that
   provides an overview of the database process's state. Most
   monitoring applications run this command at a regular interval to
   collection statistics about the instance:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { serverStatus: 1 }

   The value (i.e. ``1`` above), does not affect the operation of the
   command.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4
      In 2.4 you can dynamically suppress portions of the
      :dbcommand:`serverStatus` output, or include suppressed sections
      by adding fields to the command document as in the following
      examples:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, repl: 0, indexCounters: 0 } )
      db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, workingSet: 1, metrics: 0, locks: 0 } )

   .. |operation-name| replace:: :dbcommand:`serverStatus`
   .. include:: /includes/example-server-status-projection.rst

   .. seealso:: :method:`db.serverStatus()` and :doc:`/reference/server-status`

.. When adding status fields to this document, make sure that the
   ``docs/source/reference/server-status.txt`` document also
   reflects those changes.

Output
------

The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns a collection of information that
reflects the database's status. These data are useful for diagnosing
and assessing the performance of your MongoDB instance. This reference
catalogs each datum included in the output of this command and
provides context for using this data to more effectively administer
your database.

.. seealso:: Much of the output of :dbcommand:`serverStatus` is also
   displayed dynamically by :program:`mongostat`. See the
   :doc:`/reference/program/mongostat` command for more information.

   For examples of the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` output, see
   :doc:`/reference/server-status`.

locks
~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.1.2
   All :data:`~serverStatus.locks` statuses first appeared in the 2.1.2
   development release for the 2.2 series.

globalLock
~~~~~~~~~~

For an example of the ``globalLock`` output, see the :ref:`globalLock
section <server-status-example-globallock>` of the
:doc:`/reference/server-status` page.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock

   The :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock` data structure contains information regarding
   the database's current lock state, historical lock status, current
   operation queue, and the number of active clients.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime` represents the time, in
   microseconds, since the database last started and creation of the
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock`. This is roughly equivalent to total server
   uptime.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.lockTime

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.lockTime` represents the time, in
   microseconds, since the database last started, that the
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock` has been *held*.

   Consider this value in combination with the value of
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime`. MongoDB aggregates these values in
   the :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.ratio` value. If the
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.ratio` value is small but
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime` is high the :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock` has
   typically been held frequently for shorter periods of time, which
   may be indicative of a more normal use pattern. If the
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.lockTime` is higher and the
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime` is smaller (relatively) then fewer
   operations are responsible for a greater portion of server's use
   (relatively).

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.ratio

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.ratio` was removed. See :data:`~serverStatus.locks`.

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.ratio` displays the relationship between
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.lockTime` and :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime`.

   Low values indicate that operations have held the :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock`
   frequently for shorter periods of time. High values indicate that
   operations have held :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock` infrequently for longer periods of
   time.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue

   The :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue` data structure value provides more
   granular information concerning the number of operations queued
   because of a lock.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.total

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.total` provides a combined
   total of operations queued waiting for the lock.

   A consistently small queue, particularly of shorter operations
   should cause no concern. Also, consider this value in light of the
   size of queue waiting for the read lock
   (e.g. :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.readers`) and write lock
   (e.g. :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.writers`) individually.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.readers

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.readers` is the number of
   operations that are currently queued and waiting for the
   read lock. A consistently small read-queue, particularly of
   shorter operations should cause no concern.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.writers

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.writers` is the number of
   operations that are currently queued and waiting for the
   write lock. A consistently small write-queue, particularly of
   shorter operations is no cause for concern.

globalLock.activeClients
========================

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients

   The :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients` data structure provides more
   granular information about the number of connected clients and the
   operation types (e.g. read or write) performed by these clients.

   Use this data to provide context for the
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue` data.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.total

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.total` is the total number
   of active client connections to the database. This combines clients
   that are performing read operations
   (e.g. :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.readers`) and clients that
   are performing write operations (e.g. :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.writers`).

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.readers

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.readers` contains a count
   of the active client connections performing read operations.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.writers

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.writers` contains a count
   of active client connections performing write operations.

.. _memory-status:
.. _server-status-memory:

mem
~~~

For an example of the ``mem`` output, see the :ref:`mem section
<server-status-example-memory>` of the :doc:`/reference/server-status`
page.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem

   The :data:`~serverStatus.mem` data structure holds information regarding the target
   system architecture of :program:`mongod` and current memory use.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.bits

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.bits` is either ``64`` or ``32``,
   depending on which target architecture specified during the
   :program:`mongod` compilation process. In most instances this is
   ``64``, and this value does not change over time.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.resident

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.resident` is roughly equivalent to the amount
   of RAM, in megabytes (MB), currently used by the database process. In normal
   use this value tends to grow. In dedicated database servers this
   number tends to approach the total amount of system memory.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.virtual

   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.virtual` displays the quantity, in
   megabytes (MB), of virtual memory used by the :program:`mongod`
   process. With :term:`journaling <journal>` enabled, the value of
   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.virtual` is at least twice the value of
   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped`.

   If :data:`~serverStatus.mem.virtual` value is significantly larger
   than :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped` (e.g. 3 or more times), this
   may indicate a memory leak.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.supported

   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.supported` is true when the underlying system supports
   extended memory information. If this value is false and the system
   does not support extended memory information, then other
   :data:`~serverStatus.mem` values may not be accessible to the database server.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.mapped

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped` provides the amount of mapped memory,
   in megabytes (MB), by
   the database. Because MongoDB uses memory-mapped files, this value
   is likely to be to be roughly equivalent to the total size of your
   database or databases.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.mappedWithJournal

   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mappedWithJournal` provides the amount of
   mapped memory, in megabytes (MB), including the memory used for
   journaling.
   This value will always be twice the value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped`.
   This field is only included if journaling is enabled.

.. _server-status-connections:

connections
~~~~~~~~~~~

For an example of the ``connections`` output, see the :ref:`connections
section <server-status-example-connections>` of the
:doc:`/reference/server-status` page.

.. data:: serverStatus.connections

   The :data:`~serverStatus.connections` sub document data regarding the
   current status of incoming connections and availability of the database
   server. Use these values to assess the current load and capacity
   requirements of the server.

.. data:: serverStatus.connections.current

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.connections.current` corresponds to the number of
   connections to the database server from clients. This number
   includes the current shell session. Consider the value of
   :data:`~serverStatus.connections.available` to add more context to this
   datum.

   This figure will include all incoming connections including any shell
   connections or connections from other servers, such as :term:`replica set`
   members or :program:`mongos` instances.

.. data:: serverStatus.connections.available

   :data:`~serverStatus.connections.available` provides a count of the number of unused
   available incoming connections the database can provide. Consider this
   value in combination with the value of
   :data:`~serverStatus.connections.current` to understand the connection load on
   the database, and the :doc:`/reference/ulimit` document for
   more information about system thresholds on available connections.

.. data:: serverStatus.connections.totalCreated

   :data:`~serverStatus.connections.totalCreated` provides a count of
   **all** incoming connections created to the server. This number includes
   connections that have since closed.

.. _server-status-extra-info:
.. _server-status-extra_info:
.. _server-status-extrainfo:

extra_info
~~~~~~~~~~

For an example of the ``extra_info`` output, see the :ref:`extra_info
section <server-status-example-extrainfo>` of the
:doc:`/reference/server-status` page.

.. data:: serverStatus.extra_info

   The :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info` data structure holds data collected by the
   :program:`mongod` instance about the underlying system. Your system may
   only report a subset of these fields.

.. data:: serverStatus.extra_info.note

   The field :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info.note` reports that the data in this
   structure depend on the underlying platform, and has the text:
   "fields vary by platform."

.. data:: serverStatus.extra_info.heap_usage_bytes

   The :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info.heap_usage_bytes` field is only available on
   Unix/Linux systems, and reports the total size in bytes of heap space
   used by the database process.

.. data:: serverStatus.extra_info.page_faults

   The :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info.page_faults`
   Reports the total number of page faults that require
   disk operations. Page faults refer to operations that require the
   database server to access data which isn't available in active
   memory. The :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info.page_faults` counter may
   increase dramatically during
   moments of poor performance and may correlate with limited
   memory environments and larger data sets. Limited and sporadic page
   faults do not necessarily indicate an issue.

.. _server-status-indexcounters:

indexCounters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an example of the ``indexCounters`` output, see the
:ref:`indexCounters section <server-status-example-indexcounters>` of
the :doc:`/reference/server-status` page.

.. data:: serverStatus.indexCounters

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      Previously, data in the :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters` document
      reported sampled data, and were only useful in relative
      comparison to each other, because they could not reflect
      absolute index use. In 2.2 and later, these data reflect actual
      index use.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4
      Fields previously in the ``btree`` sub-document of
      :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters` are now fields in the
      :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters` document.

   The :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters` data structure reports information
   regarding the state and use of indexes in MongoDB.

.. data:: serverStatus.indexCounters.accesses

   :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.accesses` reports the number of times
   that operations have accessed indexes. This value is the
   combination of the :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.hits` and
   :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.misses`. Higher values indicate that
   your database has indexes and that queries are taking advantage of
   these indexes. If this number does not grow over time, this might
   indicate that your indexes do not effectively support your use.

.. data:: serverStatus.indexCounters.hits

   The :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.hits` value reflects the number of
   times that an index has been accessed and :program:`mongod` is able
   to return the index from memory.

   A higher value indicates effective index
   use. :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.hits` values that represent a
   greater proportion of the :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.accesses`
   value, tend to indicate more effective index configuration.

.. data:: serverStatus.indexCounters.misses

   The :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.misses` value represents the
   number of times that an operation attempted to access an index that
   was not in memory. These "misses," do not indicate a failed query
   or operation, but rather an inefficient use of the index. Lower
   values in this field indicate better index use and likely overall
   performance as well.

.. data:: serverStatus.indexCounters.resets

   The :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.resets` value reflects the number
   of times that the index counters have been reset since the database
   last restarted. Typically this value is ``0``, but use this value
   to provide context for the data specified by other
   :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters` values.

.. data:: serverStatus.indexCounters.missRatio

   The :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.missRatio` value is the ratio of
   :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.hits` to
   :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.misses`. This value is
   typically ``0`` or approaching ``0``.

.. _server-status-backgroundflushing:
.. _server-status-background-flushing:

backgroundFlushing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an example of the ``backgroundFlushing`` output, see the
:ref:`backgroundFlushing section
<server-status-example-backgroundflushing>` of the
:doc:`/reference/server-status` page.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing

   :program:`mongod` periodically flushes writes to disk. In the default
   configuration, this happens every 60 seconds. The
   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing` data structure contains data regarding
   these operations. Consider these values if you have concerns about
   write performance and :ref:`journaling <journaling-status>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.flushes

   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.flushes` is a counter that collects the
   number of times the database has flushed all writes to disk. This
   value will grow as database runs for longer periods of time.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.total_ms

   The :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.total_ms` value provides the total number
   of milliseconds (ms) that the :program:`mongod` processes have spent
   writing (i.e. flushing) data to disk. Because this is an absolute
   value, consider the value of :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.flushes`
   and :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.average_ms` to provide better
   context for this datum.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.average_ms

   The :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.average_ms` value describes the
   relationship between the number of flushes and the total amount of
   time that the database has spent writing data to disk. The larger
   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.flushes` is, the more likely this value
   is likely to represent a "normal," time; however, abnormal data can
   skew this value.

   Use the :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_ms` to ensure that a high
   average is not skewed by transient historical issue or a
   random write distribution.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_ms

   The value of the :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_ms` field is the amount
   of time, in milliseconds, that the last flush operation took to
   complete. Use this value to verify that the current performance of
   the server and is in line with the historical data provided by
   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.average_ms` and
   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.total_ms`.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_finished

   The :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_finished` field provides a timestamp
   of the last completed flush operation in the :term:`ISODate`
   format. If this value is more than a few minutes old relative to
   your server's current time and accounting for differences in time
   zone, restarting the database may result in some data loss.

   Also consider ongoing operations that might skew this value by
   routinely block write operations.

.. _server-status-cursors:

cursors
~~~~~~~

.. deprecated:: 2.6
   See the :ref:`serverStatus.metrics.cursor <server-status-metrics>` field instead.

For an example of the ``cursors`` output, see the :ref:`cursors section
<server-status-example-cursors>` of the :doc:`/reference/server-status`
page.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors

   The :data:`~serverStatus.cursors` data structure contains data regarding cursor state
   and use.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.note

   A note specifying to use the :data:`serverStatus.metrics.cursor`
   field instead of :data:`serverStatus.cursors`.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.totalOpen

   :data:`~serverStatus.cursors.totalOpen` provides the number of cursors that
   MongoDB is maintaining for clients. Because MongoDB exhausts unused
   cursors, typically this value small or zero. However, if there is a
   queue, stale :term:`tailable cursor`, or a large number of
   operations, this value may rise.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.clientCursors_size

   .. deprecated:: 1.x
      See :data:`~serverStatus.cursors.totalOpen` for this datum.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.timedOut

   :data:`~serverStatus.cursors.timedOut` provides a counter of the total number
   of cursors that have timed out since the server process started. If
   this number is large or growing at a regular rate, this may
   indicate an application error.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.totalNoTimeout

   :data:`~serverStatus.cursors.totalNoTimeout` provides the number of open

   development release for the 2.2 series.

.. data:: serverStatus.recordStats

   The :data:`~serverStatus.recordStats` document provides fine grained reporting
   on page faults on a per database level.

   MongoDB uses a read lock on each database to return
   :data:`~serverStatus.recordStats`. To minimize this overhead, you

workingSet
~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.4

.. note:: The :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet` data is only included in
   the output of :dbcommand:`serverStatus` if explicitly enabled. To
   return the :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet`, use one of the
   following commands:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.serverStatus( { workingSet: 1 } )
      db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, workingSet: 1 } )

For an example of the ``workingSet`` output, see the :ref:`workingSet
section <server-status-example-workingset>` of the
:doc:`/reference/server-status` page.

.. data:: serverStatus.workingSet

   :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet` is a document that contains values
   useful for estimating the size of the working set, which is the
   amount of data that MongoDB uses
   actively. :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet` uses an internal data
   structure that tracks pages accessed by :program:`mongod`.

.. data:: serverStatus.workingSet.note

   :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet.note` is a field that holds a
   string warning that the :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet`
   document is an estimate.

.. data:: serverStatus.workingSet.pagesInMemory

   :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet.pagesInMemory` contains a count of
   the total number of pages accessed by :program:`mongod` over the
   period displayed in
   :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet.overSeconds`. The default page size
   is 4 kilobytes: to convert this value to the amount of data in
   memory multiply this value by 4 kilobytes.

   If your total working set is less than the size of physical
   memory, over time the value of
   :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet.pagesInMemory` will reflect your data
   size.

   Use :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet.pagesInMemory` in conjunction
   with :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet.overSeconds` to help estimate
   the actual size of the working set.

.. data:: serverStatus.workingSet.computationTimeMicros

   :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet.computationTimeMicros` reports the
   amount of time the :program:`mongod` instance used to compute the other
   fields in the :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet` section.

   Reporting on :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet` may impact the
   performance of other operations on the :program:`mongod` instance
   because MongoDB must collect some data within the context of a
   lock. Ensure that automated monitoring tools consider this metric
   when determining the frequency of collection for
   :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet`.

.. data:: serverStatus.workingSet.overSeconds

   :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet.overSeconds` returns the amount of
   time elapsed between the newest and oldest pages tracked in the
   :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet.pagesInMemory` data point.

   If :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet.overSeconds` is decreasing, or
   if :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet.pagesInMemory` equals physical
   RAM *and* :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet.overSeconds` is very
   small, the working set may be much *larger* than physical RAM.

   When :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet.overSeconds` is large,
   MongoDB's data set is equal to or *smaller* than physical RAM.

.. _server-status-metrics-cursor:

.. data:: serverStatus.metrics.cursor

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   The :data:`~serverStatus.metrics.cursor` is a document that contains
   data regarding cursor state and use.

.. data:: serverStatus.metrics.cursor.timedOut

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   :data:`~serverStatus.metrics.cursor.timedOut` provides the total
   number of cursors that have timed out since the server process
   started. If this number is large or growing at a regular rate, this
   may indicate an application error.

.. data:: serverStatus.metrics.cursor.open

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   The :data:`~serverStatus.metrics.cursor.open` is an embedded
   document that contains data regarding open cursors.

.. data:: serverStatus.metrics.cursor.open.noTimeout

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   :data:`~serverStatus.metrics.cursor.open.noTimeout` provides the
   number of open cursors with the option
   :data:`DBQuery.Option.noTimeout` set to prevent timeout after a
   period of inactivity.

.. data:: serverStatus.metrics.cursor.open.pinned

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   :data:`serverStatus.metrics.cursor.open.pinned` provides the number
   of "pinned" open cursors.

.. data:: serverStatus.metrics.cursor.open.total

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   :data:`~serverStatus.metrics.cursor.open.total` provides the number
   of cursors that MongoDB is maintaining for clients. Because MongoDB
   exhausts unused cursors, typically this value small or zero.
   However, if there is a queue, stale tailable cursors, or a large
   number of operations this value may rise.
