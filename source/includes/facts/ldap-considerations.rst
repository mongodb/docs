- To configure |ldap| in |k8s-crds|, use the parameters under the
  :setting:`spec.security.authentication.ldap` and other
  :ref:`security LDAP settings <security-settings>` specific to the
  MongoDB Agent, from the |k8s-op-short| MongoDB resource specification.
  The procedures in this section describe the required settings and
  provide examples of LDAP configuration.

- To improve security, consider :ref:`configuring TLS <secure-tls>`.
  Encryption with |tls| is optional. By default, |ldap| traffic is sent
  as plain text. This means that username and password are exposed to
  network threats. Many modern directory services, such as Microsoft
  Active Directory, require encrypted connections. Consider using
  |ldap| over |tls-ssl| to encrypt vauthentication requests in your
  |k8s-op-short| MongoDB deployments.
