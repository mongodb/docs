Overview
--------

You can configure a file's :doc:`metadata attributes
</hosting/file-metadata-attributes>` to describe aspects of the file,
such as its content type, language, or encoding. You can also use
metadata attributes to configure the CDN's caching behavior and specify
how clients should handle files when they access them.

         .. step:: Navigate to the File in the File Tree

            To add a metadata attribute to a specific file you need to find the
            file in the hosted file tree. To find the file:

            1. Click :guilabel:`Hosting` in the left navigation menu.

            2. Select the :guilabel:`Files` tab.

            3. Find the entry for the file in the file tree.


         .. step:: Add a New Attribute

            Once you have found the file, you need to add a new metadata
            attribute to it. To add a new metadata attribute:

            1. Click the file's :guilabel:`Actions (...)` button.

            2. Click :guilabel:`Edit Attributes...`

            3. In the :guilabel:`Set Attributes` modal, click :guilabel:`Add
               Attribute`.


         .. step:: Select the Attribute Type and Value

            The new metadata attribute will not have a type or value when you
            first add it.

            1. Select the attribute type from new attribute's left-hand dropdown

            2. Enter a value for the attribute in the right-hand input box.

            3. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

      :tabid: cli
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Pull Your App's Latest Configuration Files

            .. code-block:: shell

               {+cli-bin+} pull --remote=<App ID>


         .. step:: Add Attributes to the Metadata Configuration File

            The metadata for all hosted files associated with your application is
            configured by an array of metadata attribute definition objects that
            you define in a file named :ref:`metadata.json
            <hosting-metadata-json>` in your application's ``hosting``
            subdirectory.

            Atlas App Services will automatically infer and assign a ``Content-Type`` to every
            file you upload. If you you want to override the default
            ``Content-Type`` or specify additional :doc:`metadata attributes
            </hosting/file-metadata-attributes>` for a file, add an entry to
            :ref:`metadata.json <hosting-metadata-json>` for the file and
            attributes that you want to configure. Each file's entry should be a
            document with the following form:

            .. include:: /hosting/includes/metadata-config-json.rst

            .. note::

               If you include an entry in ``metadata.json`` for a file that does
               not exist, you will not be able to import your changes. Ensure that
               only hosted files are represented in ``metadata.json``.


         .. step:: Import the File Metadata Configuration

            Once you have added all the metadata attributes you want to configure
            to ``metadata.json``, you can import the application directory to
            actually update the associated file metadata.

            Navigate to the root of the application directory and run the
            following command:

            .. code-block:: shell

               {+cli-bin+} push --include-hosting
