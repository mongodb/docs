Overview
--------

Administrators can enable two-factor authentication. When enabled,
two-factor authentication requires a user to enter a verification code
to log in and to perform certain protected operations. Operations that
require two-factor authentication include:

- restoring and deleting snapshots,

- stopping and terminating Backup for a :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>` or
  :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`,

- inviting and adding users,

- generating new two-factor authentication backup codes, and

- saving phone numbers for two-factor authentication.

Optionally, administrators can set up two-factor authentication with Twilio. This
allows users to receive their authentication codes via SMS.

Users configure two-factor authentication on their accounts through their
|mms| :ref:`user profiles <profile-page>`, where they select whether to
receive their verification codes through voice calls, text messages (SMS),
or the Google Authenticator application. If your organization does not use
`Twilio <http://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart>`_, then users can receive
codes only through Google Authenticator.

Administrators can reset accounts for individual users as needed. Reseting
a user's account clears out the user's existing settings for two-factor
authentication. When the user next performs an action that requires
verification, |mms| forces the user to re-enter settings for two-factor
authentication.

Procedures
----------

Enable Two-factor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-two-factor-authentication-ui.rst

.. _enable-twilio:

*Optional*. Enable Twilio Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To allow users to receive their authentication codes via SMS,
administrators can optionally enable integration with Twilio.

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-twilio-integration-ui.rst

Reset a User's Two-factor Authentication Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Resetting the user's account clears out any existing two-factor
authentication information. The user will be forced to set it up again at
the next login.

You must have the ``global user admin`` or ``global owner`` :doc:`role
</reference/user-roles>` to perform this procedure.
