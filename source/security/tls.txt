Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to connect to MongoDB instances with the
`TLS/SSL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`__
security protocol using the underlying TLS/SSL support in the JDK. To
configure your connection to use TLS/SSL, enable the TLS/SSL settings in
either the `ConnectionString <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/ConnectionString.html>`__
or `MongoClientSettings <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.html>`__.

.. note:: Debugging TLS/SSL

   If you experience trouble setting up your TLS/SSL connection, you can
   use the ``-Djavax.net.debug=all`` system property to view more
   log statements. See `the Oracle guide to debugging TLS/SSL connections
   <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/ReadDebug.html>`__
   for more information.

Enable TLS/SSL
--------------

You can enable TLS/SSL for the connection to your MongoDB instance
in two different ways: through a parameter in your connection string, or
using a method in the ``MongoClientSettings.Builder`` class.

.. note::

   If you connect by using the DNS seedlist protocol, indicated by the
   ``mongodb+srv`` prefix in your connection string, the driver enables
   TLS/SSL. To disable it, set the ``tls`` or ``ssl`` parameter value to
   ``false`` in your connection string or ``MongoClientSettings`` instance.

   To learn more about connection behavior when you use a DNS seedlist,
   see the :manual:`SRV Connection Format </reference/connection-string/#std-label-connections-dns-seedlist>`
   section in the Server manual.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: ConnectionString
      :tabid: connectionstring

      To enable TLS/SSL on a connection with a `ConnectionString
      <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/ConnectionString.html>`__, assign the connection string
      parameter ``tls`` a value of ``true`` in the connection string passed to
      ``MongoClients.create()``:

      .. code-block:: java

         MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb+srv://<db_username>:<db_password>@<cluster-url>?tls=true");
         
      The following table describes the parameter you can include in your
      connection string to modify the driver's TSL behavior:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 20 10 20

         * - Option Name
           - Type
           - Description

         * - **ssl**
           - boolean
           - Specifies that all communication with MongoDB instances must 
               use TLS/SSL. Superseded by the **tls** option.

               | **Default**: ``false``

         * - **tls**
           - boolean
           - Specifies that all communication with MongoDB instances must 
               use TLS. Supersedes the **ssl** option.

               | **Default**: ``false``

         * - **tlsInsecure**
           - boolean
           - Specifies that the driver must allow invalid hostnames for TLS
               connections. Has the same effect as setting
               **tlsAllowInvalidHostnames** to ``true``. To configure TLS security
               constraints in other ways, use a
               :ref:`custom SSLContext <tls-custom-sslContext>`.

               | **Default**: ``false``

         * - **tlsAllowInvalidHostnames**
           - boolean
           - Specifies that the driver must allow invalid hostnames in the
               certificate for TLS connections. Supersedes
               **sslInvalidHostNameAllowed**.

               | **Default**: ``false``   

   .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
      :tabid: mongoclientsettings

      To configure your ``MongoClient``'s TLS/SSL connection options using the
      ``MongoClientSettings.Builder`` class, chain the
      `applyToSslSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToSslSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
      method. Set the ``enabled`` property to ``true`` in the ``SslSettings.Builder``
      block to enable TLS/SSL:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MCSettings.java
         :start-after: begin SslSettings
         :end-before: end SslSettings
         :language: java
         :emphasize-lines: 3-4
         :dedent:
      
      The following table describes the methods you can chain to your
      settings to modify the driver's TSL behavior:

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 40 60
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Method
           - Description

         * - ``applyConnectionString()``
           - Uses the settings from a ``ConnectionString`` object.

         * - ``applySettings()``
           - Uses the TLS/SSL settings specified in a ``SslSettings`` object.

         * - ``context()``
           - Sets the ``SSLContext`` for use when you enable TLS/SSL.

         * - ``enabled()``
           - Whether to enable TLS/SSL. (You must enable this for Atlas clusters.)

         * - ``invalidHostNameAllowed()``
           - Whether to allow a mismatch between the server's hostname and the hostname specified by the TLS certificate.

.. _tls_configure-certificates:

Configure Certificates
----------------------

Java applications that initiate TLS/SSL requests require access to
cryptographic certificates that prove identity for the application
itself and other applications with which the application
interacts. You can configure access to these certificates in your application with
the following mechanisms:

- The JVM Trust Store and JVM Key Store
- A Client-Specific Trust Store and Key Store

.. note::

   The following sections are based on the documentation for Oracle JDK,
   so some might not apply to your JDK or to your custom TLS/SSL
   implementation.

.. _tls-configure-jvm-truststore:

Configure the JVM Trust Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   By default, the JRE includes many commonly used public certificates
   from signing authorities like `Let's Encrypt
   <https://letsencrypt.org/>`__. As a result, you can connect to
   instances of :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </?jmp=docs_driver_java>` (or any other
   server whose certificate is signed by an authority in the JRE's default
   certificate store) with TLS/SSL without configuring the trust store.

The JVM trust store saves certificates that securely identify other
applications with which your Java application interacts. Using these
certificates, your application can prove that the connection to another
application is genuine and secure from tampering by third parties.

If your MongoDB instance uses a certificate that is signed by an
authority that is not present in the JRE's default certificate store,
your application must configure two system properties to initiate
SSL/TLS requests. These properties ensure that your application can
validate the TLS/SSL certificate presented by a connected MongoDB instance.

- ``javax.net.ssl.trustStore``: the path to a trust store containing the
  certificate of the signing authority

- ``javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword``: the password to access the trust
  store defined in ``javax.net.ssl.trustStore``

You can create a trust store with the `keytool
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html>`__
command line tool provided as part of the JDK:

.. code-block:: console

   keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -file <path to certificate authority file>
            -keystore <path to trust store> -storepass <password>

Configure the JVM Key Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   By default, MongoDB instances do not perform client certificate
   validation. You must configure the key store if you configured your MongoDB
   instance to validate client certificates.

The JVM key store saves certificates that securely identify your Java
application to other applications. Using these certificates, other
applications can prove that the connection to your application is
genuine and secure from tampering by third parties.

An application that initiates TLS/SSL requests needs to set two JVM system
properties to ensure that the client presents a TLS/SSL certificate to
the MongoDB deployment:

- ``javax.net.ssl.keyStore``: the path to a key store containing the client's
  TLS/SSL certificates

- ``javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword``: the password to access the key store
  defined in ``javax.net.ssl.keyStore``

You can create a key store with the `keytool
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html>`__
or `openssl <https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl.html>`__
command line tool.

For more information about configuring a Java application to use TLS/SSL,
please see the `JSSE Reference Guide
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html>`__.

.. _tls-disable-hostname-verification:

Configure a Client-Specific Trust Store and Key Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure a client-specific trust store and key store using the
``init()`` method of the ``SSLContext`` class.

You can find an example showing how to configure a client with an ``SSLContext``
instance in the
:ref:`Customize TLS/SSL Configuration with an SSLContext section of this guide <tls-custom-sslContext>`.

For more information about the ``SSLContext`` class, see the API
documentation for `SSL Context <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/javax/net/ssl/SSLContext.html>`__.

Disable Hostname Verification
-----------------------------

By default, the driver ensures that the hostname included in the server's
TLS/SSL certificates matches the hostnames provided when constructing
a ``MongoClient``. To disable hostname verification for your
application, you can explicitly disable this by setting the
``invalidHostNameAllowed`` property of the builder to ``true`` in the
``applytoSslSettings()`` builder lambda:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
        .applyToSslSettings(builder -> {
                    builder.enabled(true);
                    builder.invalidHostNameAllowed(true);
                })
        .build();

.. warning::

   Disabling hostname verification can make your configuration
   `insecure <https://tlseminar.github.io/docs/mostdangerous.pdf>`__.
   Disable hostname verification only for testing purposes or
   when there is no other alternative.

.. _tls-restrict-tls-1.2:

Restrict Connections to TLS 1.2 Only
------------------------------------

To restrict your application to use only the TLS 1.2 protocol, set the
``jdk.tls.client.protocols`` system property to "TLSv1.2".

.. note::

   Java Runtime Environments (JREs) before Java 8 only enabled
   the TLS 1.2 protocol in update releases. If your JRE has not enabled
   the TLS 1.2 protocol, upgrade to a later release to connect by using
   TLS 1.2.

.. _tls-custom-sslContext:

Customize TLS/SSL Configuration through the Java SE SSLContext
--------------------------------------------------------------

If your TLS/SSL configuration requires customization, you can
set the ``sslContext`` property of your ``MongoClient`` by
passing an `SSLContext
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/SSLContext.html>`__
object to the builder in the ``applyToSslSettings()`` lambda:

.. code-block:: java

   SSLContext sslContext = ...
   MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
        .applyToSslSettings(builder -> {
                    builder.enabled(true);
                    builder.context(sslContext);
                })
        .build();
   MongoClient client = MongoClients.create(settings);

Customize TLS/SSL Configuration through the Netty SslContext
------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the driver with `Netty <https://netty.io/>`__ for network IO,
you have an option to plug an alternative TLS/SSL protocol implementation
provided by Netty.

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

   import com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings;
   import com.mongodb.client.MongoClients;
   import com.mongodb.client.MongoClient;
   import io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext;
   import io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContextBuilder;
   import io.netty.handler.ssl.SslProvider;

.. note::

   The driver tests with Netty version ``{+nettyVersion+}``

To instruct the driver to use
`io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext <https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslContext.html>`__,
configure
`NettyTransportSettings <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/NettyTransportSettings.html>`__
when you define your `MongoClientSettings <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.html>`__.
Use `MongoClientSettings.Builder.transportSettings
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#transportSettings(com.mongodb.connection.TransportSettings)>`__
and `NettyTransportSettings.Builder.sslContext
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/NettyTransportSettings.Builder.html#sslContext(io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext)>`__
to build your settings:

.. code-block:: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3-8
   :copyable: true

   SslContext sslContext = SslContextBuilder.forClient()
           .sslProvider(SslProvider.OPENSSL)
           .build();
   MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
           .applyToSslSettings(builder -> builder.enabled(true))
           .transportSettings(TransportSettings.nettyBuilder()
                              .sslContext(sslContext)
                              .build())
           .build();
   MongoClient client = MongoClients.create(settings);

For more details about the ``io.netty.handler.ssl.SslProvider``, see the `Netty
documentation
<https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/handler/ssl/SslProvider.html>`__

Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
-----------------------------------------

OCSP is a standard used to check whether X.509 certificates have been
revoked. A certificate authority can add an X.509 certificate to the
Certificate Revocation List (CRL) before the expiry time to invalidate
the certificate. When a client sends an X.509 certificate during the TLS
handshake, the CA's revocation server checks the CRL and returns a status
of "good", "revoked", or "unknown".

The driver supports the following variations of OCSP:

- **Client-Driven OCSP**
- **OCSP Stapling**

The following sections describe the differences between them and how to enable
them for your application.

.. note::

   The Java driver uses the JVM arguments configured for the application
   and cannot be overridden for a specific ``MongoClient`` instance.

Client-Driven OCSP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In client-driven OCSP, the client sends the certificate in an OCSP request to
an OCSP responder after receiving the certificate from the server. The OCSP
responder checks the status of the certificate with a certificate
authority (CA) and reports whether it's valid in a response sent to the
client.

To enable client-driven OCSP for your application, set the following JVM
system properties:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - Property
     - Value

   * - ``com.sun.net.ssl.checkRevocation``
     - Set this property to ``true`` to enable revocation checking.

   * - ``ocsp.enable``
     - Set this property to ``true`` to enable client-driven OCSP.

.. warning::

   If the OCSP responder is unavailable, the TLS support provided by the
   JDK reports a "hard fail". This differs from the "soft fail" behavior of
   the MongoDB Shell and some other drivers.

OCSP Stapling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OCSP stapling is a mechanism in which the server must obtain the signed
certificate from the certificate authority (CA) and include it in a
time-stamped OCSP response to the client.

To enable OCSP stapling for your application, set the following JVM system
properties:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``com.sun.net.ssl.checkRevocation``
     - Set this property to ``true`` to enable revocation checking.

   * - ``jdk.tls.client.enableStatusRequestExtension``
     - | Set this property to ``true`` to enable OCSP stapling.
       |
       | If unset or set to ``false``, the connection can proceed regardless of the presence or status of the certificate revocation response.

For more information about OCSP, check out the following resources:

- Oracle JDK 8 Documentation on `how to enable OCSP for an application <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/ocsp.html>`__
- :rfc:`Official IETF specification for OCSP (RFC 6960) <6960>`
