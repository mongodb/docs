              Community edition.

              directory and, if applicable, the existing configuration

              You cannot use the ``.msi`` to install the Enterprise
              edition if you have the Community edition of the same
              release series installed on the same machine. That is, if
              you have version 4.4.0 Community edition installed, you
              cannot use the ``.msi`` to install the 4.4.0 or 4.4.1
              Enterprise edition.

          1. Manually download the archive file from the `MongoDB
             Download Center
             <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/enterprise?tck=docs_server>`__.

          #. To install, extract/unzip the file to a location
             different from that of your current Community
             edition.
          
             In the upgrade procedure, you will use the existing
             data directory and, if applicable, the existing
             configuration file.
