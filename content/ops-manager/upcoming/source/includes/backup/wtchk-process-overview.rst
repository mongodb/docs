The backup process takes a snapshot of the data directory at its
:ref:`scheduled snapshot intervals <edit-snapshot-schedule>`. This
process copies the data files in a MongoDB deployment, sending them
over the network via |onprem| to your existing snapshot storage. Your
deployment can still handle read and write operations during the
copying process.

The backup process works in this manner regardless of how snapshots are
stored.

.. note::

   With the new Backup process, there are no longer initial syncs. As a
   result of not having initial syncs, |onprem| can support a wider
   array of customers such as those heavily using
   :manual:`renameCollection </reference/command/renameCollection>`.
