Upgrade |ak8so| v1.x to v2.x

   :description: Upgrade Atlas Kubernetes Operator from v1.x to v2.x by updating custom resource specifications, deploying a new Kubernetes cluster, and transitioning management to the new deployment.

You can upgrade from a ``v1.x`` |ak8so| deployment by following this upgrade 
procedure. To do so, you will need to update your existing MongoDB custom 
resource specification, as YAML field names in ``v2.x`` have changed and all 
credentials are now passed as |k8s| Secrets. Moreover, you must spin 
up a new |k8s| cluster, deploy |ak8so| ``v2.x`` there, and then 
transition the management of your existing Mongodb |service| database instance 
to this new |ak8so| ``v2.x`` deployment.
