Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform
**aggregation operations**.

Aggregation operations process data in your MongoDB collections and
return computed results. The MongoDB Aggregation framework, which is
part of the Query API, is modeled on the concept of data processing
pipelines. Documents enter a pipeline that contains one or more stages,
and this pipeline transforms the documents into an aggregated result.

An aggregation operation is similar to a car factory. A car factory has
an assembly line, which contains assembly stations with specialized
tools to do specific jobs, like drills and welders. Raw parts enter the
factory, and then the assembly line transforms and assembles them into a
finished product.

The **aggregation pipeline** is the assembly line, **aggregation stages** are the
assembly stations, and **operator expressions** are the
specialized tools.

Compare Aggregation and Find Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table lists the different tasks that find
operations can perform and compares them to what aggregation
operations can perform. The aggregation framework provides
expanded functionality that allows you to transform and manipulate
your data.

   * - Find Operations
     - Aggregation Operations

   * - | Select certain documents to return
       | Select which fields to return
       | Sort the results
       | Limit the results
       | Count the results
     - | Select certain documents to return
       | Select which fields to return
       | Sort the results
       | Limit the results
       | Count the results
       | Rename fields
       | Compute new fields
       | Summarize data
       | Connect and merge data sets

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following limitations when performing aggregation operations:

- Returned documents cannot violate the
  :manual:`BSON document size limit </reference/limits/#mongodb-limit-BSON-Document-Size>`
  of 16 megabytes.
- Pipeline stages have a memory limit of 100 megabytes by default. You can exceed this
  limit by passing a value of ``true`` to the ``allow_disk_use`` method and chaining the
  method to ``aggregate``.
- The :manual:`$graphLookup </reference/operator/aggregation/graphLookup/>`
  operator has a strict memory limit of 100 megabytes and ignores the
  value passed to the ``allow_disk_use`` method.

.. _ruby-run-aggregation:

Run Aggregation Operations
--------------------------

.. note:: Sample Data
  
   The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
   database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
   free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas
   </getting-started>` guide.

To perform an aggregation, define each pipeline stage as a Ruby ``hash``, and
then pass the pipeline of operations to the ``aggregate`` method.

.. _ruby-aggregation-example:

Aggregation Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code example produces a count of the number of bakeries in each
borough of New York. To do so, it uses an aggregation pipeline with the
following stages:

- A :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage to filter for documents whose ``cuisine`` field contains
  the value ``"Bakery"``.
- A :manual:`$group </reference/operator/aggregation/group/>` stage to group the matching documents by the ``borough`` field,
  accumulating a count of documents for each distinct value.

.. io-code-block::
    :copyable:

    .. input:: /includes/aggregation.rb
       :start-after: start-aggregation
       :end-before: end-aggregation
       :language: ruby
       :dedent:

    .. output::
       :visible: false

       {"_id"=>"Bronx", "count"=>71}
       {"_id"=>"Manhattan", "count"=>221}
       {"_id"=>"Queens", "count"=>204}
       {"_id"=>"Missing", "count"=>2}
       {"_id"=>"Staten Island", "count"=>20}
       {"_id"=>"Brooklyn", "count"=>173}

Explain an Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view information about how MongoDB executes your operation, you can instruct
the MongoDB :manual:`query planner </core/query-plans>` to **explain** it. When
MongoDB explains an operation, it returns **execution plans** and performance
statistics. An execution plan is a potential way in which MongoDB can complete
an operation. When you instruct MongoDB to explain an operation, it returns both
the plan MongoDB executed and any rejected execution plans by default.

To explain an aggregation operation, chain the ``explain`` method to the
``aggregate`` method.

The following example instructs MongoDB to explain the aggregation operation
from the preceding :ref:`ruby-aggregation-example`:

.. io-code-block::
    :copyable:

    .. input:: /includes/aggregation.rb
       :start-after: start-explain-aggregation
       :end-before: end-explain-aggregation
       :language: ruby
       :dedent:

    .. output::
       :visible: false

       {"explainVersion"=>"2", "queryPlanner"=>{"namespace"=>"sample_restaurants.restaurants",
       "parsedQuery"=>{"cuisine"=> {"$eq"=> "Bakery"}}, "indexFilterSet"=>false,
       "planCacheKey"=>"6104204B", "optimizedPipeline"=>true, "maxIndexedOrSolutionsReached"=>false,
       "maxIndexedAndSolutionsReached"=>false, "maxScansToExplodeReached"=>false,
       "prunedSimilarIndexes"=>false, "winningPlan"=>{"isCached"=>false,
       "queryPlan"=>{"stage"=>"GROUP", "planNodeId"=>3,
       "inputStage"=>{"stage"=>"COLLSCAN", "planNodeId"=>1, "filter"=>{},
       "direction"=>"forward"}},...}

Run an Atlas Full-Text Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Only Available on Atlas for MongoDB v4.2 and later

   This aggregation pipeline operator is only available for collections hosted
   on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` clusters running v4.2 or later that are
   covered by an :atlas:`Atlas Search index </reference/atlas-search/index-definitions/>`.

To specify a full-text search of one or more fields, you can create a
``$search`` pipeline stage.

This example creates pipeline stages to perform the following actions:

- Search the ``name`` field for the term ``"Salt"``
- Project only the ``_id`` and the ``name`` values of matching documents

.. important::

    To run the following example, you must create an Atlas Search index on the ``restaurants``
    collection that covers the ``name`` field. Then, replace the ``"<your_search_index_name>"``
    placeholder with the name of the index. To learn how to create an Atlas Search index,
    see the :ref:`ruby-atlas-search-index` guide.

.. io-code-block::
    :copyable:

    .. input:: /includes/aggregation.rb
       :start-after: start-search-aggregation
       :end-before: end-search-aggregation
       :language: ruby
       :dedent:

    .. output::
       :visible: false

       {"_id"=>  {"$oid"=>  "..."}, "name"=>  "Fresh Salt"}
       {"_id"=>  {"$oid"=>  "..."}, "name"=>  "Salt & Pepper"}
       {"_id"=>  {"$oid"=>  "..."}, "name"=>  "Salt + Charcoal"}
       {"_id"=>  {"$oid"=>  "..."}, "name"=>  "A Salt & Battery"}
       {"_id"=>  {"$oid"=> "..."},  "name"=>  "Salt And Fat"}
       {"_id"=>  {"$oid"=>  "..."}, "name"=>  "Salt And Pepper Diner"}
