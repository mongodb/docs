Summary
-------

.. data:: invalidate

   An ``invalidate`` event occurs when an operation renders the change stream
   invalid. For example, a change stream opened on a collection that was later 
   dropped or renamed would cause an ``invalidate`` event.

Description
-----------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``_id``
     - Document
     - .. include:: /includes/change-stream/id

   * - ``clusterTime``
     - Timestamp
     - .. include:: /includes/change-stream/clusterTime

   * - ``operationType``
     - string
     - .. include:: /includes/change-stream/operationType

       Returns a value of ``invalidate`` for these change events.

Example
-------

The following example illustrates an ``invalidate`` event:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
      "_id": { <Resume Token> },
      "operationType": "invalidate",
      "clusterTime": <Timestamp>,
   }

Change streams opened on collections raise an ``invalidate`` event when a 
:ref:`drop <change-event-drop>`, :ref:`rename <change-event-rename>`, 
or :ref:`dropDatabase <change-event-dropDatabase>` operation occurs 
that affects the watched collection.

Change streams opened on databases raise an ``invalidate`` event when a
:ref:`dropDatabase <change-event-dropDatabase>` event occurs that affects
the watched database.

``invalidate`` events close the change stream cursor.
