|service| supports restoring a database or collection by querying a
:doc:`continuous backup </backup/continuous-backups>` snapshot.

.. important::

   |service| does not support querying :doc:`cloud provider snapshots
   </backup/cloud-provider-snapshots>`. 

You can use a :doc:`queryable backup snapshot </query-backup>`
to export data for a database or a collection and restore to the target
deployment. The following procedure connects to the queryable backup
instance via an |service|-provided tunnel.
