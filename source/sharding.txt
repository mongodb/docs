Sharding distributes a
single logical database system across a cluster of machines. Sharding
uses range-based portioning to distribute :term:`documents <document>`
based on a
specific :term:`shard key`.

This page lists the documents, tutorials, and reference pages that
describe sharding.

For an overview, see :doc:`/core/sharding`. To configure, maintain, and
troubleshoot shard clusters, see :doc:`/administration/sharding`. For
deployment architectures, see
:doc:`/administration/sharding-architectures` For details on the
internal operations of sharding, see :doc:`/core/sharding-internals`.
For common procedures, see the :ref:`tutorials list
<sharding-tutorials>`.
