Deploy Replica Set and Configure Authentication and Authorization
=================================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

With :doc:`authentication </core/authentication>` enabled, MongoDB
forces all clients to identify themselves before granting access to
the server. :doc:`Authorization </core/authorization>`, in turn,
allows administrators to define and limit the resources and operations
that a user can access. Using authentication and authorization is a
key part of a complete security strategy.

All MongoDB deployments support authentication. By default, MongoDB
does not require authorization checking. You can enforce authorization
checking when deploying MongoDB, or on an existing deploying; however,
you cannot enable authorization checking on a running deployment
without downtime.

This tutorial provides a procedure for creating a MongoDB :doc:`replica
set </core/replication-introduction>` that uses the challenge-response
authentication mechanism. The tutorial includes creation of a minimal
authorization system to support basic operations.

Considerations
--------------

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this procedure, you will configure MongoDB using the default
challenge-response authentication mechanism, using the
:setting:`keyFile` to supply the password for :ref:`inter-process
authentication <inter-process-auth-key-file>`. The content of the key
file is the shared secret used for all internal authentication.

All deployments that enforce authorization checking should have one
*user administrator* user that can create new users and modify
existing users. During this procedure you will create a user
administrator that you will use to administer this
deployment.

Procedure
---------

This procedure deploys a replica set in which all members use the same key
file.
