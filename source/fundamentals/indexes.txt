Overview
--------

Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without indexes, MongoDB must scan *every* document in a
collection (a **collection scan**) to find the documents that match each query. These collection scans are slow and can
negatively affect the performance of your application. If an appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB can use the
index to limit the number of documents it must inspect.

Indexes also:

- allow efficient sorting
- enable special capabilities like :ref:`geospatial <golang-geo-indexes>` search
- allow adding constraints to ensure a field value is :ref:`unique <golang-unique-indexes>`
- and :manual:`more </indexes/>`

.. tip::

   Indexes are also used by update operations when finding the document(s) to update, delete operations when finding the
   document(s) to delete, and by :manual:`certain stages </core/aggregation-pipeline/#pipeline-operators-and-indexes>` in
   the aggregation pipeline.

Query Coverage and Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you execute a query against MongoDB, your command can include various elements:

- query criteria that specify field(s) and value(s) you are looking for
- options that affect the query's execution (e.g. read concern)
- projection criteria to specify the fields MongoDB should return (optional)
- sort criteria to specify the order documents will be returned from MongoDB (optional)

When all the fields specified in the query, projection, and sort are in the same index, MongoDB returns results directly
from the index, also called a **covered query**.

.. important:: Sort Order

   Sort criteria must match or invert the order of the index.

   Consider an index on the field ``name`` in ascending order (A-Z), ``age`` in descending order (9-0):

   .. code-block:: none
      :copyable: false

      name_1_age_-1

   MongoDB would use this index when you sort your data by either:

   - ``name`` ascending, ``age`` descending
   - ``name`` descending, ``age`` ascending

   Specifying a sort order of ``name`` and :guilabel:`age` ascending or :guilabel:`name` and ``age``
   descending would require an in-memory sort.

To learn more about how to ensure your index covers your query criteria and projection, see the MongoDB manual
articles on :manual:`query coverage </core/query-optimization/#read-operations-covered-query>`.

Operational Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often in your application's queries and operations
that return sorted results. Each index that you add consumes disk space and memory when active so you should track index
memory and disk usage for capacity planning. In addition, when a write operation updates an indexed field, MongoDB also
has to update the related index.

Since MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, applications can query against fields whose names cannot be known in advance or
are arbitrary. MongoDB 4.2 introduced :manual:`wildcard indexes </core/index-wildcard/>` to help support these queries.
Wildcard indexes are not designed to replace workload-based index planning.

To learn more about designing your data model and choosing indexes appropriate for your application, see the MongoDB
server documentation on :manual:`Indexing Strategies </applications/indexes>` and
:manual:`Data Modeling and Indexes </core/data-model-operations/#data-model-indexes>`.

Index Types
-----------

MongoDB supports a number of different index types to support querying your data. The following sections describe the
most common index types and provide sample code for creating each index type. For a full list of index types, see
:manual:`Indexes </indexes/>`.

.. common-content-end


.. common-content-begin

Single Field and Compound Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Single Field Indexes
++++++++++++++++++++

:manual:`Single field indexes </core/index-single/>` are indexes with a reference to a single field within a collection's
documents. They improve single field query and sort performance, and support :manual:`TTL Indexes </core/index-ttl>` that
automatically remove documents from a collection after a certain amount of time or at a specific clock time.


.. note::

   The ``_id_`` index is an example of a single field index. This index is automatically created on the ``_id`` field
   when a new collection is created.

The following example creates an index in ascending order on the ``title`` field:

.. common-content-end


The following is an example of a query that would be covered by the index created above:


.. common-content-begin

To learn more, see the MongoDB server manual section on :manual:`single field indexes </core/index-single>`.

Compound Indexes
++++++++++++++++

:manual:`Compound </core/index-compound/>` indexes hold references to multiple fields within a collection's documents,
improving query and sort performance.

.. tip::

   Read more about compound indexes, **index prefixes**, and sort order :manual:`here </core/index-compound/#prefixes>`.

The following example creates a compound index on the ``type`` and ``rated`` fields:

.. common-content-end


.. common-content-begin

To learn more, see the MongoDB server manual section on :manual:`Compound indexes </core/index-compound>`.

Multikey Indexes (Indexes on Array Fields)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multikey indexes** are indexes that improve performance for queries that specify a field with an index that contains
an array value. You can define a multikey index using the same syntax as a single field or compound index.

The following example creates a compound, multikey index on the ``rated`, ``genres`` (an array of
Strings), and ``title`` fields:

.. common-content-end

.. common-content-begin

Multikey indexes behave differently from non-multikey indexes in terms of query coverage, index bound computation, and
sort behavior. For a full explanation of multikey indexes, including a discussion of their behavior and limitations,
refer to the :manual:`Multikey Indexes page </core/index-multikey>` in the MongoDB manual.

Text Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Text indexes** support text search queries on string content. These indexes can include any field whose value is a
string or an array of string elements. MongoDB supports text search for various languages. You can specify the default
language as an option when creating the index.

.. tip::

   Text indexes differ from the more powerful :atlas:`Atlas full text search indexes </atlas-search/>` Atlas users
   should use Atlas search.

.. warning::

   Collections are limited to one text index. Keep in mind that a text index can cover multiple fields.

.. common-content-end

.. common-content-begin

For a full explanation of text search with MongoDB, refer to :manual:`Text Indexes </core/index-text>` in the MongoDB
manual.

Geospatial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _golang-geo-indexes:

MongoDB supports queries of geospatial coordinate data using **2dsphere indexes**. With a 2dsphere index, you can query
the geospatial data for inclusion, intersection, and proximity. To learn more about querying geospatial data, see
:manual:`Geospatial Queries </geospatial-queries/>`.

To create a 2dsphere index, you must specify a field that contains only **GeoJSON objects**. To learn more about this
type, see the MongoDB server manual page on :manual:`GeoJSON objects </reference/geojson>`.

The ``location.geo` field in following sample document from the ``theaters`` collection in the ``sample_mflix```
database is a GeoJSON Point object that describes the coordinates of the theater:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("59a47286cfa9a3a73e51e75c"),
      "theaterId" : 104,
      "location" : {
         "address" : {
            "street1" : "5000 W 147th St",
            "city" : "Hawthorne",
            "state" : "CA",
            "zipcode" : "90250"
         },
         "geo" : {
            "type" : "Point",
            "coordinates" : [
               -118.36559,
               33.897167
            ]
         }
      }
   }

The following example creates a ``2dsphere`` index on the ``location.geo`` field:

.. warning::

   Attemping to create a geospatial index on a field that is covered by a geospatial index will result in an error.

.. common-content-end

.. common-content-begin

MongoDB also supports ``2d`` indexes for calculating distances on a Euclidean plane and for working with the "legacy
coordinate pairs" syntax used in MongoDB 2.2 and earlier. To learn more, see the :manual:`Geospatial Queries page </geospatial-queries>`
in the MongoDB server manual.

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _golang-unique-indexes:

Unique indexes ensure that the indexed fields do not store duplicate values. By default, MongoDB creates a unique index
on the ``_id`` field during the creation of a collection. To create a unique index, specify the field or combination of
fields that you want to prevent duplication on and set the ``unique`` option to ``true``.

The following example creates a unique, descending index on the ``theaterId`` field:

.. common-content-end
