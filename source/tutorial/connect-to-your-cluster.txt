You can connect to your cluster in a variety of ways. This tutorial 
describes how to connect to your cluster using the 
{+mongosh+}, the :driver:`Node.js driver </node/>`,
the :driver:`PyMongo driver </python/>`, and :compass:`Compass </>`.

.. _gswa-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

- An |service| account.
- An organization and project added with an account's user  who has
  permissions to create clusters in this account.
- An active cluster created in this account.
- An IP address added to your IP access list.
- A :ref:`Database user <gswa-user>` on your cluster.

See :ref:`Parts 1 - 4 <atlas-getting-started>` of this tutorial for
help with the prerequisites.

.. note::

   You must have a database user set up on your cluster to access your
   deployment. For security purposes, |service| requires clients to
   authenticate as database users to access clusters.

Download and Install Utility
----------------------------

The following steps show you how to download and install the 
{+mongosh+}, the :driver:`Node.js driver </node/>`,
and the :driver:`PyMongo </python>` driver. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-gswa-prereqs.rst

Select the appropriate tab based on how you would like to connect to 
your cluster:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: PyMongo Driver
      :tabid: python-driver

      MongoDB drivers allow you to communicate with your MongoDB
      database programatically.

      For this tutorial, we will walk through setting up and using
      the Python MongoDB driver, called :guilabel:`PyMongo`. If you
      are interested in working with a different driver, refer to
      the :driver:`MongoDB Driver documentation </>`.

      To complete this tutorial you must have:

      - A terminal.
      - `Python <https://www.python.org>`__. Visit the
        `Python Downloads Page <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
        and download the latest version of Python for your
        operating system.
      - The `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`__ package
        installer. Starting with Python 2.7.9 and Python 3.4,
        packages downloaded from `<https://python.org>`__ include ``pip``.
        To install ``pip`` manually, see
        the `pip installation page
        <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__. This package
        includes Python.
      - The :driver:`PyMongo </python>` driver.
      - A text editor.

      Once you have Python and ``pip`` installed:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/gswa-driver-pymongo-test.rst

   .. tab:: Node.js Driver
      :tabid: nodejs-driver
         
      To use the Node.js driver, you must have:
         
      - A terminal
      - A text editor
      - `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/>`__
      - `Node.js <https://www.nodejs.org/>`__
      - The MongoDB :driver:`Node.js driver </node>`

      To install the MongoDB Node.js driver, run the following command
      at a terminal prompt:
         
      .. code-block:: shell
         
         npm install mongodb --save
   
   .. tab:: MongoDB Shell
      :tabid: shell

      To complete this tutorial you must have:

      - A terminal
      - {+mongosh+}

      *Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*

      {+mongosh+} is an interactive
      command line interface to MongoDB. You can use {+mongosh+}
      to insert and interact with data on your |service|
      cluster.

      To download and install {+mongosh+}:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-shell-install.rst

   .. tab:: Compass
      :tabid: compass
      
      *Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*
      
      :compass:`MongoDB Compass </>` allows you to explore, modify,
      and visualize data in your |service| cluster.

      To download and install |compass|:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-compass-install.rst


.. _connect-to-your-cluster:

Connect to Your Atlas Cluster
-----------------------------

In |service|, you can connect to your cluster using the following
connection methods:

- :guilabel:`Connect with the MongoDB Shell` to interact with your
  cluster using the Javascript interface of {+mongosh+}.

- :guilabel:`Connect your application` to your cluster using the
  :driver:`Node.js driver </node/>`, or the
  :driver:`PyMongo driver </python/>`.

- :guilabel:`Connect to your cluster using MongoDB
  Compass` to explore, modify, and visualize your data with
  :compass:`Compass </>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-gswa-prereqs.rst

Select the appropriate tab based on your preferred connection method:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: PyMongo Driver
      :tabid: python-driver

      *Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*
                  
      You'll need to get your cluster's connection string from
      |service| to connect to the cluster using the PyMongo driver.
         
      .. include:: /includes/steps/gswa-driver-connect.rst

   .. tab:: Node.js Driver
      :tabid: nodejs-driver

      *Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*
         
      You'll need to get your cluster's connection string from
      |service| to connect to the cluster using the Node.js driver.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/gswa-driver-connect-node.rst
   
   .. tab:: MongoDB Shell
      :tabid: shell

      *Estimated completion time: 3 minutes* 

      Now that you have installed {+mongosh+}, you
      can use the shell to connect to your |service| cluster.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-shell-connect.rst

   .. tab:: Compass
      :tabid: compass

      *Estimated completion time: 3 minutes* 
      
      You'll need to get your cluster's connection string from |service|
      to connect to the cluster using |compass|.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/gswa-connect-to-cluster-compass.rst
