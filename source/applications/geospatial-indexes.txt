Geospatial Indexes and Queries
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB offers a number of indexes and query mechanisms to handle
geospatial information. This section introduces MongoDB's geospatial
features. 

Surfaces
--------

Before storing your location data and writing queries, you must decide
the type of surface to use to perform calculations. The type you choose
affects how you store data, what type of index to build, and the syntax
of your queries.

MongoDB offers two surface types:

- **Spherical**

  To calculate geometry over an Earth-like sphere, store your location
  data on a spherical surface and use :doc:`2dsphere
  </core/2dsphere>` index.

  Store your location data as GeoJSON objects with this coordinate-axis
  order: **longitude, latitude**. The coordinate reference system for
  GeoJSON uses the :term:`WGS84` datum.

- **Flat**

  To calculate distances on a Euclidean plane, store your location data
  as legacy coordinate pairs and use a :doc:`2d </core/2d>` index.

Location Data
-------------

If you choose spherical surface calculations, you store location data as

- :term:`GeoJSON` objects (preferred).

  Queries on GeoJSON objects always calculate on a sphere. The default
  coordinate reference system for GeoJSON uses the :term:`WGS84` datum.

  .. versionadded:: 2.4 The storage and querying of GeoJSON objects
     is new in version 2.4. Prior to version 2.4, all geospatial data was
     stored as coordinate pairs.

  MongoDB supports the following GeoJSON objects:

  - Point

  - LineString

  - Polygon

- :term:`Legacy coordinate pairs <legacy coordinate pairs>`

  MongoDB supports spherical surface calculations on legacy coordinate
  pairs by converting the data to the GeoJSON Point type.

If you choose flat surface calculations, you can store data only as
:term:`legacy coordinate pairs`.

Query Operations
----------------

MongoDB's geospatial query operators let you query for:

- **Inclusion**. MongoDB can query for locations contained entirely
  within a specified polygon. Inclusion queries use the
  :operator:`$geoWithin` operator.

- **Intersection**. MongoDB can query for locations that intersect with
  a specified geometry. These queries apply only to data on a spherical
  surface. These queries use the :operator:`$geoIntersects` operator.

- **Proximity**. MongoDB can query for the points nearest to another
  point. Proximity queries use the :operator:`$near` operator. The
  :operator:`$near` operator requires a ``2d`` or ``2dsphere`` index.

Geospatial Indexes
------------------

MongoDB provides the following geospatial index types to support the
geospatial queries:

- :doc:`2dsphere </core/2dsphere>`, which supports:

  - Calculations on a sphere

  - Both GeoJSON objects and legacy coordinate pairs

  - A compound index with scalar index fields (i.e. ascending or
    descending) as a prefix or suffix of the ``2dsphere`` index field

  .. versionadded:: 2.4
     ``2dsphere`` indexes are not available before version 2.4.

- :doc:`2d </core/2d>`, which supports:

  - Calculations using flat geometry

  - Legacy coordinate pairs (i.e., geospatial points on a flat
    coordinate system)

  - A compound index with only one additional field, as a suffix of the
    ``2d`` index field
