========================
In-Memory Storage Engine
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. warning:: The in-memory storage engine is currently in **beta**. Do not use
   in production.

Starting in MongoDB Enterprise 3.2, an in-memory storage engine is available in
the 64-bit builds for beta-testing purposes. Other than some metadata, the
in-memory storage engine does not maintain any on-disk data, By avoiding disk
I/O, the in-memory storge engine allows for more predictable latency of
database operations.

Specify In-Memory Storage Engine
--------------------------------

To select the in-memory storage engine, specify:

- ``inMemory`` for the :option:`--storageEngine` option or the
  :setting:`storage.engine` setting.

- ``--dbpath``. Although the in-memory storage engine does not write
  data to the filesystem, it maintains small metadata files in the
  ``--dbpath``.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --storageEngine inMemory --dbpath <path>

See :ref:`cli-mongod-inmemory` for configuration options specific to this storage engine.

.. warning::
   The in-memory storage engine is non-persistent, and all data will be lost when
   the :program:`mongod` instance shuts down.

Concurrency
-----------

The in-memory storage engine uses *document-level* concurrency control for write
operations. As a result, multiple clients can modify different
documents of a collection at the same time.

Durability
----------

The in-memory storage engine is non-persistent and does not write data to persistent
storage.  As such, the concept of :term:`journal` or waiting for data to become
:term:`durable` does not apply to the in-memory storage engine.
Write operations that specify a write concern :writeconcern:`journaled <j>` are
acknowledged immediately. When an :program:`mongod` instance shuts down, either as
result of the :dbcommand:`shutdown` command or due to a system error, recovery is
impossible.
