Export an App
=============

Overview
--------

You can download a directory of your App's configuration files by
exporting them. This allows you to save your App's configuration in
source control and to work locally with {+cli+} and your preferred
text editor.

The exported directory contains configuration files for most components
of your App, including Data Sources, Functions, Triggers, and other
services. For more information on the contents of an exported App, see
:ref:`App Configuration <app-configuration>`.

The export does not include any :ref:`Secrets <app-secret>`. If you
create a new App based on exported configuration files, you must
manually add Secrets to the new App. For more information, see
:ref:`Copy an App <copy-app>`.

Before You Begin
----------------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      You will need the following to export an App in the Atlas UI:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      You will need the following to export an App in the CLI:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-admin-api-key.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/appservices-cli.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/app-id.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      You will need the following to export an App with the Admin API:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-admin-api-key.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/api-project-app-id.rst

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Navigate to Your App

            In the Atlas UI, click the :guilabel:`App Services` tab.
            Then, click the tile for the App you want to export.

         .. step:: Export the App

            Click :guilabel:`Deployment` in the left-hand navigation.

            From here, there are two ways to export your app:

            - To export your App's current configuration, click the
               :guilabel:`Export App` tab, then click the
               :guilabel:`Export App` button.

            - To export your App's configuration from a previous
               deployment, click the :guilabel:`History` tab and find the
               deployment you want to export.

               Once you've found the deployment, click the
               :guilabel:`Export` button at the end of the row.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

            .. include:: /includes/cli-login.rst

         .. step:: Run the App Export Command

            The ``pull`` command downloads an application's
            configuration files to a local directory. You choose which
            app to export by specifying its Client App ID with the
            ``--remote`` flag.

            .. code-block:: shell

               {+cli-bin+} pull --remote=<Client App ID>

            By default the command pulls files into the current working
            directory. You can configure the command to create a new
            directory instead by specifying the directory path with the
            ``--local`` flag.

            .. code-block:: shell

               {+cli-bin+} pull --remote=<App ID> --local=<Output Directory Path>

            .. tip::

               The directory specified by ``--local`` must not already
               exist, otherwise the CLI throws an error and does not
               pull the configuration files.

            The command also supports :ref:`additional flags
            <appservices-pull>` that you can optionally include to
            customize your app. The following table lists common flags
            you might use:

            .. list-table::

               * - ``--include-dependencies``
                 - If specified, external dependencies are exported as a
                   ``node_modules`` archive in the ``/functions``
                   directory.

               * - ``--include-hosting``
                 - If specified, hosted static assets are exported
                   in the ``/hosting/files`` directory.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

            .. include:: /includes/api-authenticate-instructions.rst

         .. step:: Export Your App

            To export your App, send a request to the
            :admin-api-endpoint:`Export an App
            <operation/adminExportApplication>` endpoint.

            Make sure to include your Admin API ``access_token``, the
            ``groupId`` of the Atlas project containing your App, and
            the App's internal ``appId`` hex string:

            .. code-block:: shell

               curl -X GET \
                 https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/export \
                 -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
                 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
                 --output ./exported-app.zip

            You can export the configuration for a specific deployment
            by specifying the deployment ``_id`` as a URL query
            parameter:

            .. code-block:: text

               https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/export?deployment={deploymentId}

            If the request is successful, the endpoint returns a ``200``
            response that contains a ``.zip`` directory of your
            application's current configuration files.

An exported App contains configuration files for every component of the
App. For detailed information about each type of configuration file, see
:ref:`app-configuration`.

An exported configuration directory has the following structure:
