The following tutorials provide information in maintaining existing
replica sets.

:doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size`
   Increase the size of the :term:`oplog` which logs operations. In
   most cases, the default oplog size is sufficient.

:doc:`/tutorial/perform-maintence-on-replica-set-members`
   Perform maintenance on a member of a replica set while minimizing
   downtime.

:doc:`/tutorial/force-member-to-be-primary`
   Force a replica set member to become primary.

:doc:`/tutorial/resync-replica-set-member`
   Sync the data on a member. Either perform initial sync on a new
   member or resync the data on an existing member that has fallen
   too far behind to catch up by way of normal replication.

:doc:`/tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets`
   Assign tags to replica set members for use in targeting read and
   write operations to specific members.

:doc:`/tutorial/reconfigure-replica-set-with-unavailable-members`
   Reconfigure a replica set when a majority of replica set members
   are down or unreachable.

:doc:`/tutorial/manage-chained-replication`
   Disable or enable chained replication. Chained replication occurs
   when a secondary replicates from another secondary instead of the
   primary.

:doc:`/tutorial/change-hostnames-in-a-replica-set`
   Update the replica set configuration to reflect changes in
   members' hostnames.

:doc:`/tutorial/configure-replica-set-secondary-sync-target`
   Specify the member that a secondary member synchronizes from.
