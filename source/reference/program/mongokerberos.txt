.. versionadded:: 4.4 MongoDB Enterprise

Synopsis
--------

Starting in version 4.4, MongoDB Enterprise provides
:binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` for testing MongoDB's Kerberos and GSSAPI
:ref:`configuration options <security.sasl.options>` against a
running Kerberos deployment. :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` can be used
in one of two modes: *server* and *client*.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Mode

     - Description

   * - Server

     - In *server mode*, :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` analyzes
       Kerberos-related configurations on the server, and returns a
       report which includes error messages for any configurations that
       are problematic. For usage, see :ref:`mongokeberos-usage-server`

   * - Client

     - In *client mode*, :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` tests Kerberos
       authentication for a provided username, and returns a report
       which includes the success or failure of each step in the
       Kerberos authentication procedure. For usage, see
       :ref:`mongokeberos-usage-client`

Error messages for both modes include information on specific errors
encountered and potential advice for resolving the error.

:binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` supports the following deployment types,
in both server and client modes:

- Linux MongoDB clients authenticating to MIT Kerberos deployments on
  :ref:`supported Linux platforms <prod-notes-supported-platforms>`.

- Windows MongoDB clients authenticating to Windows Active Directory
  deployments on 
  :ref:`supported Windows platforms <prod-notes-supported-platforms>`.

- Linux MongoDB clients authenticating to Windows Active Directory
  deployments.

.. note::

   MongoDB Enterprise and :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` only support the
   `MIT implementation <https://kerberos.org/>`__
   of Kerberos.

Generally, when configuring options related to
:ref:`Kerberos authentication <security-kerberos>`, it is good practice
to verify your configuration with :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos`.

:binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` is a testing and verification tool; it does not
edit any files or configure any services. For configuring Kerberos on
your platform please consult the `MIT Kerberos documentation
<https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/>`__, or your platform's
documentation. For configuring MongoDB to authenticate using Kerberos,
please reference the following tutorials:

- :doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication`
- :doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-windows-with-kerberos-authentication`.

This document provides a complete overview of all command line options
for :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos`.

Server Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~

Running :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` in server mode performs a series of
verification steps against your system's Kerberos configuration,
including checking for proper DNS resolution, validation of the Kerberos
system keytab file, and testing against the MongoDB service principal
for your :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

Before you can use :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` in server mode, you must:

#. Configure Kerberos on your platform according to your platform's
   documentation.

#. Create the MongoDB service principal for use with your
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, as described
   in the following steps:

   - :ref:`Configure Service Principal on Linux <kerberos-linux-prerequisites>`

   - :ref:`Configure Service Principal on Windows <assign-service-principal-name>`

Once you have completed these steps, you can run
:binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` in server mode using the
``--server`` flag as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

   mongokerberos --server
   
If Kerberos has been configured properly on the server, and the service
principal created successfully, the output might resemble the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Resolving kerberos environment...
   [OK] Kerberos environment resolved without errors.

   Verifying DNS resolution works with Kerberos service at <hostname>...
   [OK] DNS test successful.

   Getting MIT Kerberos KRB5 environment variables...
     * KRB5CCNAME: not set.
     * KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME: not set.
     * KRB5_CONFIG: not set.
     * KRB5_KTNAME: not set.
     * KRB5_TRACE: not set.
   [OK]

   Verifying existence of KRB5 keytab FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab...
   [OK] KRB5 keytab exists and is populated.

   Checking principal(s) in KRB5 keytab...
   Found the following principals for MongoDB service mongodb:
     * mongodb/server.example.com@SERVER.EXAMPLE.COM
   Found the following kvnos in keytab entries for service mongodb:
     * 3
   [OK] KRB5 keytab is valid.

   Fetching KRB5 Config...
   KRB5 config profile resolved as:
      <Your Kerberos profile file will be output here>
   [OK] KRB5 config profile resolved without errors.

   Attempting to initiate security context with service credentials...
   [OK] Security context initiated successfully.

The final message indicates that the system's Kerberos configuration is
ready to be used with MongoDB. If any errors are encountered with
the configuration, they will be presented as part of the above output.

.. _mongokeberos-usage-client:

Client Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~

Running :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` in client mode tests authentication
against your system's Kerberos environment, performing each step in the
Kerberos authentication process, including checking for proper DNS
resolution, verification of the Kerberos client keytab file, and testing
whether a ticket can be successfully granted. Running
:binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` in client mode simulates the client
authentication procedure of the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

Before you can use :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` in client mode, you must
first have configured Kerberos on your platform according to your
platform's documentation. Optionally, you may also choose to run
:binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` in
:ref:`server mode <mongokeberos-usage-server>` first to verify that your
platform's Kerberos configuration is valid before using client mode.

Once you have completed these steps, you can run
:binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` in client mode to test user authentication,
using the ``--client`` flag as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

   mongokerberos --client --username <username>
   
You must provide a valid username, which is used to request a Kerberos
ticket as part of the authentication procedure. Your platform's
Kerberos infrastructure must be aware of this user.

If the provided credentials are valid, and the Kerberos options in the
configuration files are valid, the output might resemble the following:

.. code-block:: none
  :copyable: false

   Resolving kerberos environment...
   [OK] Kerberos environment resolved without errors.

   Verifying DNS resolution works with Kerberos service at <hostname>...
   [OK] DNS test successful.

   Getting MIT Kerberos KRB5 environment variables...
     * KRB5CCNAME: not set.
     * KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME: not set.
     * KRB5_CONFIG: not set.
     * KRB5_KTNAME: not set.
     * KRB5_TRACE: not set.
   [OK]

   Verifying existence of KRB5 client keytab FILE:/path/to/client.keytab...
   [OK] KRB5 client keytab exists and is populated.

   Checking principal(s) in KRB5 keytab...
   [OK] KRB5 keytab is valid.

   Fetching KRB5 Config...
   KRB5 config profile resolved as:
      <Your Kerberos profile file will be output here>
   [OK] KRB5 config profile resolved without errors.

   Attempting client half of GSSAPI conversation...
   [OK] Client half of GSSAPI conversation completed successfully.

The final message indicates that client authentication completed
successfully for the user provided.  If any errors are encountered
during the authentication steps, they will be presented as part of the
above output.

Options
-------

.. only:: (not man)

   .. class:: hidden

      .. binary:: mongokerberos

.. program:: mongokerberos

.. _mongokeberos-option-server:

.. option:: --server

   Runs :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` in server mode to test that your
   platform's Kerberos configuration is valid for use with MongoDB.

   See :ref:`mongokeberos-usage-server` for example usage and expected
   output.

.. _mongokeberos-option-client:

.. option:: --client

   Runs :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` in client mode to test client
   authentication against your system's Kerberos environment. Requires
   specifying a valid username with :option:`--username` when running in
   client mode. :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` will request a Kerberos ticket
   for this username as part of the validation procedure. Running
   :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` in client mode simulates the client
   authentication procedure of the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. 

   See :ref:`mongokeberos-usage-client` for example usage and expected
   output.

.. option:: --config <filename>, -f <filename>

   Specifies a configuration file for runtime configuration options. 
   The options are equivalent to the command-line
   configuration options. See :doc:`/reference/configuration-options` for
   more information.

   :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` will read the values for
   :parameter:`saslHostName` and :parameter:`saslServiceName` from this
   file if present. These values can alteratively be specified with the
   :option:`--setParameter` option instead.

   Ensure the configuration file uses ASCII encoding. The
   :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` instance does not support configuration
   files with non-ASCII encoding, including UTF-8.

   Only valid in :ref:`server mode <mongokeberos-usage-server>`.

.. option:: --setParameter <options>

   Sets a configurable parameter. You can specify multiple
   ``setParameter`` fields.

   While you can use any supported parameters with ``setParameter``,
   :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` only checks for the value of the following:

   - :parameter:`saslHostName`
   - :parameter:`saslServiceName`

   If using the :option:`--config` option with a configuration file that
   also contains these values, the ``setParameter`` values will
   override the values from the configuration file.

   Valid in both :ref:`server mode <mongokeberos-usage-server>`
   and :ref:`client mode <mongokeberos-usage-client>`.

.. option:: --host <hostname>

   Specify the hostname of the MongoDB server to connect to when testing
   authentication.
   
   If :option:`--host` is not specified, :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` does
   not perform any DNS validation of the hostname (i.e. PTR record
   verification)

   Only valid in :ref:`client mode <mongokeberos-usage-client>`.

.. option:: --username <username>, -u <username>

   Username for :binary:`~bin.mongokerberos` to use when attempting Kerberos
   authentication. This value is required when running in
   :ref:`client mode<mongokeberos-usage-client>`.

   Only valid in :ref:`client mode <mongokeberos-usage-client>`.

.. option:: --gssapiServiceName <servicename>

   *default: 'mongodb'*

   Service principal name to use when authenticating using
   GSSAPI/Kerberos.

   Only valid in :ref:`client mode <mongokeberos-usage-client>`.

.. option:: --gssapiHostName <hostname>

   Remote hostname to use for purpose of GSSAPI/Kerberos authentication.

   Only valid in :ref:`client mode <mongokeberos-usage-client>`.
