.. warning::

   The ``mongo`` shell has been deprecated in MongoDB v5.0. The
   replacement is :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

   Older ``mongo`` shell documentation is included with the
   corresponding documentation for that ``MongoDB`` release.

   For the legacy ``mongo`` shell documentation, refer to the 
   `legacy documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/legacy/?site=docs>`__
   for the corresponding MongoDB Server release.

Comparison of the ``mongo`` Shell and ``mongosh``
-------------------------------------------------

The new MongoDB Shell (:binary:`~bin.mongosh`) offers numerous
advantages over the legacy :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, such as:

- Improved syntax highlighting.

- Improved command history.

- Improved logging.

``mongosh`` currently supports a subset of the legacy
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell methods. To maintain backwards
compatibility, the methods that the new ``mongosh`` supports use the
same syntax as the corresponding methods in the legacy
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

The list of methods supported by ``mongosh`` is here:
:mongosh:`MongoDB Shell Methods </reference/methods>`.
