If both the source and destination {+clusters+} are running MongoDB {+c2c-version+}+
or {+c2c-version-7+}+, |service| can pull a source {+cluster+} to an |service| 
{+cluster+} using the procedure described in this section.

This process uses |mongosync| as the underlying data migration tool,
enabling faster live migrations with less downtime:

- |service| syncs data from the source to the destination {+cluster+} until
  you cut your applications over to the destination |service| {+cluster+}.

- Once you reach the cutover step in the following procedure:
  
  - Stop writes to the source {+cluster+}.
  - Stop your application instances, point them to the |service| {+cluster+},
    and restart them.

.. _c2c-pull-limitations:

Restrictions
------------

The |c2c-limitations| apply to this live migration.

Live migration (pull) doesn't support:

- MongoDB 8.0 or rapid releases as the source or destination {+cluster+} version.
- :ref:`VPC peering <vpc-peering>` or :ref:`private endpoints <private-endpoint>`
  for either the source or destination {+cluster+}.

Supported Migration Paths
--------------------------

|service| live migration described in this section supports the following
migration paths:

Required Access
---------------

.. include:: /includes/atlas-roles/pull-live-migrate.rst

Supported Source and Destination {+Cluster+} Configuration Pairs
------------------------------------------------------------------

For this type of live migration, |service| supports the following source
and destination {+cluster+} configuration pairs:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/c2c-live-migration-supported-cluster-configurations.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

- If the {+cluster+} runs with authentication, meet the following prerequisites:

  - For replica sets, grant the :authrole:`backup` and :authrole:`readAnyDatabase`
    roles on the admin database to the user that will run the migration process.
  - For sharded {+clusters+}, grant the :authrole:`backup`, :authrole:`readAnyDatabase`,
    and :authrole:`clusterMonitor` roles on the admin database to the user
    that will run the migration process. Ensure the specified user exists
    on every shard and the config server replica set.
    The user must have permissions that allow the following actions:

    - Stop or start the sharded {+cluster+} balancer.
    - Read all databases and collections on the host.
    - Read the oplog on the host.

  - Ensure that this user is authenticated using
    :manual:`both SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 </core/security-scram/>`.

.. _live-import-c2c-migration-validation:

Pre-Migration Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the following live migration procedure, |service| runs
validation checks on the source and destination {+clusters+} and verifies that:

- The source and destination {+cluster+}\'s MongoDB version is at least |fcv|
  {+c2c-version+}+ and is matching, or at least |fcv| {+c2c-version-7+}+ and
  is matching.
- The source {+cluster+}\'s database user has the correct permissions as
  described in :ref:`live-import-c2c-security`.

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-network-encryption-pull-migration.rst

Database Users and Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| doesn't migrate any user or role data to the destination {+cluster+}.

.. include:: /includes/fact-create-atlas-user.rst

If the source {+cluster+} enforces authentication, you must recreate the
credentials that your applications use on the destination |service| {+cluster+}.
|service| uses :ref:`SCRAM <authentication-scram>` for user authentication.
To learn more, see :doc:`/security-add-mongodb-users`.

Oplog Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _lm-pull-load-balancers:

Source and Destination {+Cluster+} Balancers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-source-destination-balancers.rst

Destination {+Cluster+} Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you configure the destination {+cluster+}, consider the following:

.. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-no-data-destination-cluster.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-destination-cluster.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-perf-target-cluster.rst



- You can't select an ``M0`` (Free Tier) or ``M2/M5`` shared-tier
  {+cluster+} as the destination {+cluster+} for live migration.

- Don't change the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` flag while
  |service| live migration is running.

Avoid Workloads on the Destination {+Cluster+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Migrate Your {+Cluster+}
------------------------

.. note:: Staging and Production Migrations

   Consider running this procedure twice. Run a partial migration
   that stops at the :guilabel:`Perform the Cutover` step *first*. This
   creates an up-to-date |service|-backed staging {+cluster+} to test
   application behavior and performance using the latest
   :driver:`driver version </driver-compatibility-reference>` that
   supports the MongoDB version of the |service| {+cluster+}.

   After you test your application, run the full migration
   procedure using a separate |service| {+cluster+} to create your
   |service|-backed production environment.
