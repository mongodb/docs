Migrate Your Data to MongoDB
============================

Now that you have simplified your data model into five collections, you can 
migrate your data from PostgreSQL to MongoDB Atlas.

Before You Begin 
----------------

This task is the final step of the :ref:`insurance data model example tutorial 
<rm-example-insurance-data>`. Before you migrate your data, ensure you have 
access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster with ``dbAdmin`` permissions on the new 
database to where you will migrate the data. 

Steps 
-----

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create a new migration job
    
      In the top navigation bar, navigate to the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab 
      and click :guilabel:`Create migration job`. This opens the 
      :guilabel:`New Migration Job` modal.
      
   .. step:: Select the source database

      Click :guilabel:`Use a saved connection` and select your PostgreSQL 
      database from the drop-down menu. After you input your username and 
      password, click :guilabel:`Connect`. 

   .. step:: Input information for your destination database 

      Fill in the connection information for your MongoDB Atlas deployment and 
      click :guilabel:`Connect`. Ensure that you specify the database where you 
      want to migrate your data.

   .. step:: Review Migration Options 

      In this example, we will leave all options as default. This will migrate 
      our data in :guilabel:`Snapshot` mode, which loads all your data at once. 

      After you review the options, click :guilabel:`Review Summary`

   .. step:: Click Start

      In the :guilabel:`Review Summary` stage, click :guilabel:`Start` to begin 
      the migration job. The migration can take a couple of minutes. 
      
      Once ready, {+rel-mig+} displays the the ``COMPLETED`` tag in the 
      :guilabel:`Snapshot stage` card. You can now connect to your database and 
      view how all your data loaded in MongoDB Atlas or Compass.
