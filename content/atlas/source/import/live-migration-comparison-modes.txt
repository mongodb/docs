To migrate a {+cluster+} to MongoDB |service| with minimal downtime,
you can choose between :ref:`Atlas Live Migration <c2c-pull-live-migration>`
(which hosts |mongosync| for you), or run standalone |mongosync| directly.
Compare these methods to decide which one meets your needs.

Use |service| Live Migration for source clusters ≤5 TB or ≤3 shards.
If your source cluster exceeds these thresholds, standalone mongosync
is the better option as it provides tunable parameters, pause and resume
capabilities, detailed progress tracking, and direct log access for
debugging transient errors.

   * - Migration Mode
     - :ref:`Atlas Live Migration <c2c-pull-live-migration>`
     - Standalone |mongosync|

   * - Effort required for setting up |mongosync|
     - **Low:** Fully-managed in |service|-hosted infrastructure.
       Live migration (pull) is currently :ref:`available in these geographic regions<destination-cluster-configuration>`.
     - **High:** Requires self-hosted |mongosync| infrastructure setup.

   * - Source/Destination cluster locations
     - Source cluster can be either on-premises or in |service|.
  
       Destination cluster **must** exist in |service|.
     - Source cluster can be either on-premises or in |service|.
       
       Destination cluster can be either on-premises or in |service|.
