Indexing commonly queried fields increases the
likelihood of :ref:`covered queries <indexes-covered-queries>`. A
covered query is a query that can be satisfied entirely using an index
and does not have to examine any documents, leading to greatly improved performance.

To create a compound index, use the following prototype:

.. include:: /includes/indexes/code-examples/create-compound-index.rst

.. |page-topic| replace:: :atlas:`create and manage compound indexes in the UI </atlas-ui/indexes>`

Use Cases
---------

If your application repeatedly runs a query that contains multiple
fields, you can create a compound index to improve performance for that
query. For example, a grocery store manager often needs to look up
inventory items by name and quantity to determine which items are low
stock. You can create a compound index on both the ``item`` and
``quantity`` fields to improve query performance.

A compound index on commonly queried fields increases the chances of
:ref:`covering <indexes-covered-queries>` those queries. Covered queries
are queries that can be satisfied entirely using an index, without
examining any documents. This optimizes query performance.

Details
-------

This section describes technical details and limitations for compound
indexes.

Field Limit
~~~~~~~~~~~

A single compound index can contain up to 32 fields.

Field Order
~~~~~~~~~~~

The order of the indexed fields impacts the effectiveness of a compound
index. Compound indexes contain references to documents according to the
order of the fields in the index. To create efficient compound indexes,
follow the :ref:`ESR (Equality, Sort, Range) rule <esr-indexing-rule>`.

Sort Order
~~~~~~~~~~

Indexes store references to fields in either ascending (``1``) or
descending (``-1``) sort order. For compound indexes, sort order can
determine whether the index supports a sort operation. For more
information, see :ref:`index-compound-sort-order`.

Hashed Index Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- In MongoDB 4.4 and later, compound indexes may contain **a single**
  :ref:`hashed index field <index-type-hashed>`.

- In MongoDB 4.2 and earlier, compound indexes cannot contain any hashed
  index fields.

.. _compound-index-prefix:

Index Prefixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Index prefixes are the beginning subsets of indexed fields. Compound
indexes support queries on all fields included in the index prefix.

For example, consider this compound index:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "item": 1, "location": 1, "stock": 1 }

The index has these index prefixes:

- ``{ item: 1 }``

- ``{ item: 1, location: 1 }``

MongoDB can use the compound index to support queries on these field
combinations:

- ``item``
- ``item`` and ``location``
- ``item``, ``location``, and ``stock``

MongoDB can also use the index to support a query on the ``item`` and
``stock`` fields, since the ``item`` field corresponds to a prefix.
However, only the ``item`` field in the index can support this query.
The query cannot use the ``stock`` field which follows ``location``.

Index fields are parsed in order; if a query omits an index prefix, it
is unable to use any index fields that follow that prefix.

MongoDB **cannot** use the compound index to support queries on these
field combinations:

- ``location``
- ``stock``
- ``location`` and ``stock``

Without the ``item`` field, none of the preceding field combinations
correspond to a prefix index.

.. tip:: Remove Redundant Indexes

   If you have a collection that has both a compound index and an index on
   its prefix (for example, ``{ a: 1, b: 1 }`` and ``{ a: 1 }``), if
   neither index has a :ref:`sparse <index-type-sparse>` or :ref:`unique
   <index-type-unique>` constraint, you can remove the index on the prefix
   (``{ a: 1 }``). MongoDB uses the compound index in all of the situations
   that it would have used the prefix index.
