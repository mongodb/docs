The :guilabel:`Clusters` view displays all clusters in an |service| 
:ref:`project <projects>` and features core metrics per cluster. You can view metrics in the available charts. For more information about the :guilabel:`Clusters` view, see :ref:`view-cluster-details`.

Available Charts
----------------

|service| displays up to four
of the following charts for each cluster in the project:

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/notes/note-data-storage-granularity.rst
       
.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 65
   :header-rows: 1
        
   * - Chart
        
     - Data
        
   * - :guilabel:`Operations`
        
     - Displays the aggregated read (:guilabel:`R`) and write 
       (:guilabel:`W`) operations on the cluster. 
        
       For a replica set, the chart shows operations for the
       :term:`primary`. 
        
       For a :term:`sharded cluster`, the chart shows
       the sum of the operations on each primary in the cluster.
        
   * - :guilabel:`Logical Size`
              
       ``M0/M2/M5`` *Clusters Only*
        
     - Displays the sum of total bytes of the documents and index data
       across all databases in the cluster.
        
   * - :guilabel:`Disk Usage`
              
       ``M10+`` *Clusters Only*
        
     - The total bytes of used disk space for the cluster.
        
       For a replica set, the chart shows the disk usage of the
       primary host machine.
        
       For a sharded cluster, the chart shows the sum of disk usage
       on each primary host in the cluster. 

   * - :guilabel:`Total Index Size`

       ``M10+`` *Clusters Only*

     - The total bytes of disk space used by indexes for every database
       in the cluster.
        
   * - :guilabel:`Connections`

     - The total number of active connections to the cluster.
       For a replica set, the chart shows the number of active 
       connections to the primary. For a sharded cluster, 
       the chart shows the sum of all active connections to each 
       primary in the cluster.

   * - :guilabel:`Disk IOPS`

       ``M10+`` *Clusters Only*

     - The sum of read and write input/output operations per second
       (IOPS) for the cluster. 

   * - :guilabel:`Disk Latency` :sup:`1`

     - The latency, in milliseconds, of the disk partition used
       by MongoDB.

   * - :guilabel:`Util %` :sup:`1`

     - The percentage of time during which the partition is receiving
       and servicing requests. This includes requests from all 
       processes, not just MongoDB processes.

:sup:`1` Clusters which use :ref:`NVMe SSDs <nvme-storage>` for 
storage display ``Disk Latency`` and ``Disk Util %`` charts using the
maximum value across the physical drives that make up the
:abbr:`RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)`. The following
:ref:`cluster tiers <create-cluster-instance>` display RAID-based
metrics if they use :ref:`NVMe <nvme-storage>`:
 
- ``M80``
- ``M200``
- ``M400``
