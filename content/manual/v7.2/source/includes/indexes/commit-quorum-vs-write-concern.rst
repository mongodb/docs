There are important differences between :ref:`commit quorums
<createIndexes-cmd-commitQuorum>` and :ref:`write concerns
<write-concern>`:

- Index builds use **commit quorums**.
- Write operations use **write concerns**. 

Each data-bearing node in a cluster is a voting member.

The **commit quorum** specifies how many data-bearing voting members, or
which voting members, including the primary, must be prepared to commit
a :ref:`simultaneous index build <index-operations-simultaneous-build>`.
before the primary will execute the commit.

The **write concern** is the level of acknowledgment that the write has
propagated to the specified number of instances.

The **commit quorum** specifies how many nodes must be *ready* to finish
the index build before the primary commits the index build. In contrast,
when the primary has committed the index build, the **write concern**
specifies how many nodes must *finish* the index build before the
command returns.
