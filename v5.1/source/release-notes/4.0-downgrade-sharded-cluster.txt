Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
of this document.

Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/4.0-downgrade-path.rst

.. |downgrading| replace:: downgrading

Change Stream Consideration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.0 introduces new hex-encoded string change stream
:ref:`resume tokens <change-stream-resume-token>`:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-resume-token-versions-4.0.rst

- When downgrading from MongoDB 4.0.7 or greater, clients cannot use
  the resume tokens returned from the 4.0.7+ deployment. To resume a
  change stream, clients will need to use a pre-4.0.7 upgrade resume
  token (if available). Otherwise, clients will need to start a new change stream.

- When downgrading from MongoDB 4.0.6 or earlier, clients can use
  BinData resume tokens returned from the 4.0 deployment, but not the
  ``v0`` tokens.  

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the feature
compatibility version and remove any |newversion| features :ref:`incompatible
<4.0-compatibility-enabled>` with |oldversion| or earlier versions as outlined
below. These steps are necessary only if
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has ever been set to ``"4.0"``.

.. |target| replace:: :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance

.. _4.0-downgrade-feature-compatibility-sharded-cluster:

1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/4.0-downgrade-fcv.rst

To ensure that all members of the sharded cluster reflect the updated
``featureCompatibilityVersion``, connect to each shard replica set
member and each config server replica set member and check the
``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. tip::

   For a sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the
   following command against a shard replica set member, you must
   connect to the member as a :ref:`shard local user
   <shard-local-users>`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

All members should return a result that includes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "3.6" }


If any member returns a ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` that includes
either a ``version`` value of ``"4.0"`` or a ``targetVersion`` field,
wait for the member to reflect version ``"3.6"`` before proceeding.

For more information on the returned ``featureCompatibilityVersion``
value, see :ref:`view-fcv`.

2. Remove Backwards Incompatible Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/remove-4.0-fcv-features.rst

Procedure
---------

Downgrade a Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all
   members, including delayed replica set members in the sharded
   cluster, reflect the prerequisite changes.  That is, check the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` and the removal of incompatible
   features for each node before downgrading.

.. note:: 

   If you ran MongoDB 4.0 with :parameter:`authenticationMechanisms`
   that included ``SCRAM-SHA-256``, omit ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` when
   restarting with the |oldversion| binary.

.. include:: /includes/steps/4.0-downgrade-sharded-cluster.rst

.. include:: /includes/4.0-upgrade-replacements.rst

.. note::

   The MongoDB 3.6 deployment can use the BinData resume tokens
   returned from a change stream opened against the 4.0 deployment, but
   not the ``v0`` or the ``v1`` hex-encoded string resume tokens.
