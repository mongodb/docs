     * - Field

       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`Custom Role Name`

       - The name of your custom role.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-custom-role-name-restrictions.rst

     * - :guilabel:`Action or Role`

       - Click the dropdown to view the list of available
         :manual:`privilege actions </reference/privilege-actions/>`
         and :manual:`roles </reference/built-in-roles/>`
         your custom role can inherit. You can also inherit
         previously created custom roles.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-subset-privilege-actions.rst

         The :guilabel:`Custom Roles` list contains custom
         MongoDB roles you have previously created in |service|. Use
         these roles to create a custom role which is a superset of
         other previously created custom roles.

         All actions and roles selected as part of a single
         :guilabel:`Action or Role` item in the dialog must be
         part of the same top-level menu group in the
         :guilabel:`Select Actions` dropdown (e.g.
         :guilabel:`Collection Actions` or
         :guilabel:`Global Actions and Roles`). To grant actions
         and roles from a different top-level group, you must add
         a new action by clicking :guilabel:`Add an action or role`.

         .. note::

            There is an exception to this behavior in which you can
            specify both :guilabel:`Global Actions and Roles` and
            :guilabel:`Custom Roles` as part of a single
            :guilabel:`Action or Role` item.

     * - :guilabel:`Database`

       - The database on which the selected actions and roles
         are granted, if applicable.

         This field is required for all roles and actions under the
         :guilabel:`Collection Actions` and
         :guilabel:`Database Actions and Roles` menu groups.

     * - :guilabel:`Collection`

       - The collection within the specified database on which
         the actions and roles are granted, if applicable.

         You can specify a collection for the :authrole:`read` and
         :authrole:`readWrite` roles. If you do not specify a
         collection, the privileges are granted on all non-``system``
         collections within the specified database.

  To grant the same set of privileges on multiple databases and
  collections, click :guilabel:`Add a database or collection`.

  To grant additional sets of privileges on different databases and
  collections as part of a single custom role, click
  :guilabel:`Add an action or role`.

  .. example::

     You can create a custom role that inherits the
     :authrole:`dbAdmin` role on the ``QA`` database, and the
     :authrole:`read` role on the ``production`` database.
