The following sections outline methods to learn MongoDB basics and
best practices.

Free MongoDB Courses Online
---------------------------

To help you get started with MongoDB Compass and the MongoDB database,
see the MongoDB University course `M001
<https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M001/about>`__.  This course
provides access to a student cluster for learning about MongoDB.

If you are looking to learn more about MongoDB technologies, there are
other available courses to help you along the way.  All courses are
available at no charge.  In the course catalog, you will find courses
on:

- Development in `Java
  <https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M220J/about>`__, `Node.js
  <https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M220JS/about>`__, `Python
  <https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M220P/about>`__,

- `New features and tools available
  <https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M042/about>`__ in the latest
  version of MongoDB,

- `MongoDB Atlas Administration 
  <https://learn.mongodb.com/courses/mongodb-atlas-administration>`__,

- `Aggregation <https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M121/about>`__,

- `Monitoring and Insights <https://learn.mongodb.com/courses/monitoring-and-insights>`__,
  and more.

Free MongoDB Cluster for Learning and Testing
---------------------------------------------

If you would like to use a hosted instance of MongoDB rather than set up
a local server, you can set up a free ``M0`` cluster on `Atlas
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__, MongoDB's hosted database as a
service. The ``M0`` tier cluster is ideal for learning and testing.

Once the cluster is set up, you can use the :guilabel:`Connect` button
in the Atlas interface to obtain the correct Compass connection
settings for your cluster. Fill in the Compass connection form with your
settings to :ref:`connect to your cluster <connect-run-compass>`.

MongoDB Server Installation
---------------------------

To install and run MongoDB using your own network services, you can use
the following tutorials to get a MongoDB database server up and running:

- :manual:`Install MongoDB Enterprise on Windows
  </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-windows/>`
- :manual:`Install MongoDB Enterprise on Linux
  </administration/install-enterprise-linux/>`
- :manual:`Install MongoDB Enterprise on macOS
  </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-os-x/>`
