.. dbcommand:: delete

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   The :dbcommand:`delete` command removes documents from a collection.
   A single :dbcommand:`delete` command can contain multiple delete
   specifications. The command cannot operate on :doc:`capped
   collections </core/capped-collections>`. The remove methods provided
   by the MongoDB drivers use this command internally.

   The :dbcommand:`delete` command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         delete: <collection>,
         deletes: [
            { q : <query>, limit : <integer>, collation: <document> },
            { q : <query>, limit : <integer>, collation: <document> },
            { q : <query>, limit : <integer>, collation: <document> },
            ...
         ],
         ordered: <boolean>,
         writeConcern: { <write concern> }
      }

   The command takes the following fields:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-delete-field.rst

   Each element of the ``deletes`` array contains the following fields:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-delete-field-deletes.rst

   :return:

      A document that contains the status of the operation.
      See :ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

Behavior
--------

The total size of all the queries (i.e. the ``q`` field values) in the
``deletes`` array must be less than or equal to the :limit:`maximum
BSON document size <BSON Document Size>`.

The total number of delete documents in the ``deletes`` array must be
less than or equal to the :limit:`maximum bulk size
<Bulk Operation Size>`.

Examples
--------

Limit the Number of Documents Deleted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example deletes from the ``orders`` collection one
document that has the ``status`` equal to ``D`` by specifying the
``limit`` of ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
         delete: "orders",
         deletes: [ { q: { status: "D" }, limit: 1 } ]
      }
   )

The returned document shows that the command deleted ``1`` document.
See :ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "ok" : 1, "n" : 1 }

Delete All Documents That Match a Condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example deletes from the ``orders`` collection all
documents that have the ``status`` equal to ``D`` by specifying the
``limit`` of ``0``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
         delete: "orders",
         deletes: [ { q: { status: "D" }, limit: 0 } ],
         writeConcern: { w: "majority", wtimeout: 5000 }
      }
   )

The returned document shows that the command found and deleted ``13``
documents. See :ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "ok" : 1, "n" : 13 }

Delete All Documents from a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Delete all documents in the ``orders`` collection by specifying an
empty query condition *and* a ``limit`` of ``0``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
         delete: "orders",
         deletes: [ { q: { }, limit: 0 } ],
         writeConcern: { w: "majority", wtimeout: 5000 }
      }
   )

The returned document shows that the command found and deleted ``35``
documents in total. See :ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "ok" : 1, "n" : 35 }

Bulk Delete
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example performs multiple delete operations on the
``orders`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
         delete: "orders",
         deletes: [
            { q: { status: "D" }, limit: 0 },
            { q: { cust_num: 99999, item: "abc123", status: "A" }, limit: 1 }
         ],
         ordered: false,
         writeConcern: { w: 1 }
      }
   )

The returned document shows that the command found and deleted ``21``
documents in total for the two delete statements. See
:ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "ok" : 1, "n" : 21 }

Specify Collation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-versionadded.rst

A collection ``myColl`` has the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, category: "café", status: "A" }
   { _id: 2, category: "cafe", status: "a" }
   { _id: 3, category: "cafE", status: "a" }

The following operation includes the :ref:`collation <collation>`
option:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand({
      delete: "myColl",
      deletes: [
        { q: { category: "cafe", status: "a" }, limit: 0, collation: { locale: "fr", strength: 1 } }
      ]
   })

.. _delete-command-output:

Output
------

The returned document contains a subset of the following fields:

.. data:: delete.ok

   The status of the command.

.. data:: delete.n

   The number of documents deleted.

.. data:: delete.writeErrors

   An array of documents that contains information regarding any error
   encountered during the delete operation. The
   :data:`~delete.writeErrors` array contains an error document for
   each delete statement that errors.

   Each error document contains the following information:

   .. data:: delete.writeErrors.index

      An integer that identifies the delete statement in the
      ``deletes`` array, which uses a zero-based index.

   .. data:: delete.writeErrors.code

      An integer value identifying the error.

   .. data:: delete.writeErrors.errmsg

      A description of the error.

.. data:: delete.writeConcernError

   Document that describe error related to write concern and contains
   the field:

   .. data:: delete.writeConcernError.code

      An integer value identifying the cause of the write concern error.

   .. data:: delete.writeConcernError.errmsg

      A description of the cause of the write concern error.

The following is an example document returned for a successful
:dbcommand:`delete` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { ok: 1, n: 1 }

The following is an example document returned for a :dbcommand:`delete`
command that encountered an error:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "ok" : 1,
      "n" : 0,
      "writeErrors" : [
         {
            "index" : 0,
            "code" : 10101,
            "errmsg" : "can't remove from a capped collection: test.cappedLog"
         }
      ]
   }
