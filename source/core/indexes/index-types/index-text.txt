Text indexes support :ref:`text search queries <text-search>` on fields
containing string content. Text indexes improve performance when
searching for specific words or phrases within string content. 

A collection can only have **one** text index, but that index can cover 
multiple fields.

Indexing commonly queried fields increases the chances of :ref:`covering <indexes-covered-queries>` those queries. Covered queries
are queries that can be satisfied entirely using an index, without
examining any documents. This optimizes query performance.

To create a text index, use the following prototype:

Text Search Support
-------------------

Text indexes support :query:`$text` query operations on on-premises 
deployments. To perform text searches, you must create a text index and use the 
``$text`` query operator.

Use Cases
---------

Documents in an online shop's ``clothing`` collection include a
``description`` field that contains a string of text describing each
item. To find clothes made of ``silk``, create a text index on the
``description`` field and run a text search query for documents with the
keyword ``silk``. The search returns all documents that mention ``silk``
in the ``description`` field.

Details
-------

This section describes details for text indexes.

Compound Text Indexes 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a compound index that includes a text index key along with keys of other 
types, only the text index field determines whether the index references a 
document. The other keys do not determine whether the index references the 
documents.

``sparse`` Property 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Text indexes are always :ref:`sparse <index-type-sparse>`. When you create a 
text index, MongoDB ignores the ``sparse`` option. 

If an existing or newly inserted document lacks a text index 
field (or the field is null or an empty array), MongoDB does not add a text 
index entry for the document.

Storage Requirements and Performance Costs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Text indexes have the following storage requirements and performance costs:

- Text indexes can take up a large amount of RAM. They contain one index entry 
  for each unique post-stemmed word in each indexed field for each document
  inserted.

- Building a text index is similar to building a large
  :ref:`multikey index <index-type-multi-key>` but takes longer than building 
  a simple ordered (scalar) index on the same data.

- When building a text index that takes up a large amount of RAM, ensure 
  that you have a sufficiently high limit on open file descriptors. See the 
  :ref:`recommended settings <ulimit>`.

- Text indexes impact write performance because MongoDB must add an index 
  entry for each unique post-stemmed word in each indexed field of each new 
  source document.

- Text indexes store individual words of a text string. They do not store 
  phrases or information about the proximity of words in the documents. As a 
  result, queries that specify multiple words run faster when the entire 
  collection fits in RAM.
