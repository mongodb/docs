====================
Deploy a Replica Set
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. include:: /includes/introduction-deploy-replica-set.rst

Requirements
------------

For production deployments, you should maintain as much separation between
members as possible by hosting the :program:`mongod`
instances on separate machines. When using virtual machines for
production deployments, you should place each :program:`mongod`
instance on a separate host server serviced by redundant power circuits
and redundant network paths.

Before you can deploy a replica set, you must install MongoDB on
each system that will be part of your :term:`replica set`.
If you have not already installed MongoDB, see the :ref:`installation tutorials <tutorial-installation>`.

Before creating your replica set, you should verify that your network
configuration allows all possible connections between each member. For
a successful replica set deployment, every member must be able to
connect to every other member. For instructions on how to check
your connection, see :ref:`replica-set-troubleshooting-check-connection`.
