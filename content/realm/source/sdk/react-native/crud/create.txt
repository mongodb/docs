To add a new Realm object to a realm instance, use :realm-react-sdk:`realm.create()
<classes/Realm-1.html#create>` inside of a write transaction. If the
:ref:`schema <react-native-realm-schema>` includes the object type and the
object conforms to the schema, then Realm stores the object.

The example for creating an object uses the following schema:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: typescript

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/create-test.test.snippet.create-object-schema.tsx
         :language: typescript

   .. tab::
      :tabid: javascript

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/js/create-test.test.snippet.create-object-schema.jsx
         :language: javascript

To create a new object:

#. Access a realm instance using the ``useRealm()`` hook.
#. Create ``handleAddPerson()``, which creates a new ``Person`` object based on the TextInput value.
#. Add an `onPress <https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches>`__ event on the submit button that calls ``handleAddPerson()``.

Create an Object with a To-One Relationship
-------------------------------------------

In a one-to-one relationship, an object is related to at most one other object of a particular type.
To learn more about one-to-one relationships, refer to to :ref:`Relationships & Embedded
Objects <react-native-to-one-relationship>`.

The example for creating an object with a to-one relationship uses the following schema to indicate that a Pet Owner
may only own one Pet:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: typescript

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/create-test.test.snippet.create-to-one-schema.tsx
         :language: typescript

   .. tab::
      :tabid: javascript

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/js/create-test.test.snippet.create-to-one-schema.jsx
         :language: javascript

To create an object with a to-one relationship to another object:

#. Query the realm for a pre-existing Pet object. Assign the result to ``newPet``.
#. Create a new PetOwner object and pass ``newPet`` to the ``pet`` property.
#. Wrap your write transaction in a ``handleAddPetOwner()`` function, which creates a new ``PetOwner`` object with an associated ``Pet``.
#. Add an `onPress <https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches>`__ event on the submit button that calls ``handleAddPetOwner()``.

Create an Object with a To-Many Relationship
--------------------------------------------

In a one-to-many relationship, an object may be related to multiple objects of a particular type.
To learn more about one-to-many relationships, refer to to :ref:`Relationships & Embedded
Objects <react-native-to-many-relationship>`.

The example for creating an object with a to-many relationship uses the following schema to indicate that a Company
may employ multiple Employees:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: typescript

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/create-test.test.snippet.create-to-many-schema.tsx
         :language: typescript

   .. tab::
      :tabid: javascript

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/js/create-test.test.snippet.create-to-many-schema.jsx
         :language: javascript

To create an object with a to-many relationship to another object:

#. Query the realm for all pre-existing Employee objects using :ref:`useQuery() <react-native-use-query-hook>`.
#. Create a new Company object and pass the results of your previous query to the ``employees`` property.
#. Wrap your write transaction in a ``handleAddCompany()`` function, which creates a new ``Company`` object with an associated list of ``Employees``.
#. Add an `onPress <https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches>`__ event on the submit button that calls ``handleAddCompany()``.

Create an Embedded Object
-------------------------

An embedded object is an object that exists as data nested inside of a parent object; it cannot exist as an
independent Realm object. To learn more about embedded objects, refer to to :ref:`Relationships & Embedded
Objects <react-native-embedded-objects>`.

The example for representing an embedded object uses the following schema that allows you to embed a single
Address into a new Contact object:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

    .. tab::
       :tabid: typescript

       .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/Address.snippet.ts-address-schema.ts

          :emphasize-lines: 4
          :linenos:

          :linenos:

To create an embedded object, assign an instance of the embedded object to a parent object's property.

The following ``CreateContact`` example creates a new ``Contact`` object
with an embedded ``Address`` object.

The ``CreateContact`` component does the following:

#. Creates React `state <https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#state>`__ variables that represent the contact's name and address details.
#. Gets access to an open realm instance by calling the ``useRealm()`` hook within the component.
#. Creates a component method ``submitContact()`` that performs a write transaction to create a new ``Address`` embedded object and ``Contact`` parent object based on the ``TextInput`` values for the contact's name and address.
#. Adds an `onPress <https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches>`__ event on the "Submit Contact" button that calls ``submitContact()``.

Create an Asymmetric Object
---------------------------

An asymmetric object allows you to sync a collection unidirectionally from your device to your Atlas database, if
you are using Flexible Sync. To learn more about asymmetric objects, refer to to :ref:`Stream Data to Atlas <react-native-stream-data-to-atlas>`.

The example for creating an asymmetric object uses the following schema that defines a Weather Sensor object for
sending weather-related data one-way from your device to your Atlas database:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: javascript

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/js/data-ingest.test.snippet.data-ingest-object.jsx
         :language: javascript
         :emphasize-lines: 6

   .. tab::
      :tabid: typescript

      .. literalinclude::  /examples/generated/react-native/ts/data-ingest.test.snippet.data-ingest-object.tsx
         :language: typescript
         :emphasize-lines: 12

You can create an asymmetric object inside a write transaction using
:realm-react-sdk:`realm.create() <classes/Realm-1.html#create>`. When creating
an asymmetric object, ``Realm.create()`` returns ``undefined`` rather than the
object itself.
