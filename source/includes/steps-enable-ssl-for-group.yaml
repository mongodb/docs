  The SSL CA file is a ``.pem`` file that contains the root certificate
  chain from the Certificate Authority.
  The Monitoring and Backup Agents use the CA file for connections to
  your deployment.

  The :guilabel:`Client Certificate Mode` specifies whether client
  certificates are required for each :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
  in the deployment.
    
  - :guilabel:`OPTIONAL`: |mms| starts each :program:`mongod` and
    :program:`mongos` process with both :setting:`net.ssl.CAFile` **and**
    :setting:`net.ssl.allowConnectionsWithoutCertificates`. As such,
    :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` processes need not possess
    client certificates.
    
  - :guilabel:`REQUIRED:`: |mms| starts each :program:`mongod` and
    :program:`mongos` with the :setting:`net.ssl.CAFile` setting. Each
    :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` must possess a client
    certificate.
