Pass Realm Data Between SwiftUI Views
=====================================

The Realm Swift SDK provides several ways to pass realm data between views:

- Pass Realm objects to a view
- Use environment injection to:

  - Inject a partition value into a view
  - Inject an opened realm into a view
  - Inject a realm configuration into a view

Pass Realm Objects to a View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you use the ``@ObservedRealmObject`` or ``@ObservedResults`` property 
wrapper, you implicitly open a realm and retrieve the specified objects 
or results. You can then pass those objects to a view further down the 
hierarchy.

Pass Environment Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:apple:`Environment <documentation/swiftui/environment>` injection is a 
useful tool in SwiftUI development with Realm. 
Realm property wrappers provide different ways for you to 
work with environment values when developing your SwiftUI application.

Inject the Partition Value
``````````````````````````

If you are using :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>`, you 
can use environment injection to pass the ``.partitionValue`` environment 
value. Inject this into a view where you perform the ``@AsyncOpen`` or 
``@AutoOpen``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/Authenticate.snippet.partition-value-environment-object.swift
   :language: swift

Then, when you use the property wrapper to open a synced realm, leave
the ``partitionValue`` an empty string. The property wrapper populates the 
value from the environment object passed in from above.

   :language: swift

.. _inject-realm-as-environment-value:

Inject an Opened Realm
``````````````````````

You can inject a realm that you opened in another SwiftUI view into 
a view as an environment value. The property wrapper uses this passed-in 
realm to populate the view:

.. code-block:: swift

   ListView()
      .environment(\.realm, realm)

.. _ios-swiftui-inject-realm-configuration:

Inject a Realm Configuration
````````````````````````````

You can use a realm other than the default realm by passing a different 
configuration in an environment object.

.. code-block:: swift

   LocalOnlyContentView()
   .environment(\.realmConfiguration, Realm.Configuration( /* ... */ ))
