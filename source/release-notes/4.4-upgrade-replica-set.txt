Prerequisites
-------------

All Members Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All replica set members must be running version |oldversion|. To
upgrade a replica set from an |olderseries| and earlier, *first*
:doc:`upgrade all members of the replica set to the latest
4.2-series release </release-notes/4.2-upgrade-replica-set>`, and
then follow the procedure to upgrade from MongoDB |oldversion| to
|newversion|.

Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |oldversion| replica set must have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to |oldfcv|.

To ensure that all members of the replica set have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to |oldfcv|, connect to each
replica set member and check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

All members should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.2" }``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the
following command on the primary. A majority of the data-bearing
members must be available:

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.2" } )

For more information, see
:dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Replica Set Member State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that no replica set member is in :replstate:`ROLLBACK` or
:replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Via Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Manually
~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.

Upgrade Process
---------------

You can upgrade from MongoDB |oldversion| to |newversion| using a
"rolling" upgrade to minimize downtime by upgrading the members
individually while the other members are available.
