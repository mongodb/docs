The following procedure describes how to connect to a MongoDB resource
deployed by |k8s| from outside of the |k8s| cluster, including how to
control port mapping.

Prerequisite
------------

Compatible MongoDB Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For your databases to be accessed outside of |k8s|, they must run one
of the following versions of MongoDB:

- 3.6.17 or later
- 4.0.15 or later
- 4.2.3 or later

Procedure
---------

How you connect to a MongoDB resource that the |k8s-op-short| deployed
from outside of the |k8s| cluster depends on the resource.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: standalone

      This procedure uses the following example:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/yaml-files/example-standalone.yaml
         :language: yaml
         :start-after: START-standalone-exposed-full
         :end-before: END-standalone-exposed-full
         :linenos:
         :lineno-start: 20
         :emphasize-lines: 15

      To connect to your |k8s-op-short|-deployed MongoDB 
      standalone resource from outside of the |k8s| cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-external-standalone.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: repl

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Kubernetes
            :tabid: kubernetes

            .. important::

               This procedure explains the least complicated way to 
               enable external connectivity. Other utilities can be 
               used in production.

            To connect to your |k8s-op-short|-deployed MongoDB replica 
            set resource from outside of the |k8s| cluster:

            .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-split-horizon.rst
         
         .. tab:: OpenShift
            :tabid: openshift

            To connect to your |k8s-op-short|-deployed MongoDB replica 
            set resource from outside of the |k8s| cluster with OpenShift:

            .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-split-horizon-openshift.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: shard

      This procedure uses the following example:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Without TLS
            :tabid: k8s-without-tls

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/yaml-files/example-sharded-cluster.yaml
               :language: yaml
               :start-after: START-exposed-sharded-full
               :end-before: END-exposed-sharded-full
               :linenos:
               :lineno-start: 1
               :emphasize-lines: 19
               :copyable: false

         .. tab:: With TLS
            :tabid: k8s-with-tls

            .. tip:: **Enable Direct Access to MongoDB hosts Using Split Horizons and TLS**

               If the |k8s-op-short| deployed a |tls|\-enabled 
               sharded cluster, provide the external |dns| names 
               (|san-dns|\s) for each member.

               The |san-dns| for each MongoDB hosts corresponds to:

               .. code-block:: sh
                  :copyable: false

                  <mdb-resource-name><shard><pod-index>.<external-domain>
                  <mdb-resource-name><config><pod-index>.<external-domain>
                  <mdb-resource-name><mongos><pod-index>.<external-domain>

               Each |tls| certificate requires the |fqdn| 
               (|san-dns|) that corresponds to the |fqdn| that 
               this host has outside the |k8s| cluster.

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/yaml-files/example-sharded-cluster.yaml
               :language: yaml
               :start-after: START-exposed-sharded-tls-full
               :end-before: END-exposed-sharded-tls-full
               :linenos:
               :lineno-start: 1
               :emphasize-lines: 19-24
               :copyable: false

      To connect to your |k8s-op-short|-deployed MongoDB sharded
      cluster resource from outside of the |k8s| cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-external-sharded.rst
