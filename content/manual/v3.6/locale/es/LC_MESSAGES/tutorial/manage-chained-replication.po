"Starting in version 2.0, MongoDB supports chained replication. A chained "
"replication occurs when a :term:`secondary` member replicates from "
"another secondary member instead of from the :term:`primary`. This might "
"be the case, for example, if a secondary selects its replication target "
"based on ping time and if the closest member is another secondary."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/manage-chained-replication.txt:20

"Chained replication can reduce load on the primary. But chained "
"replication can also result in increased replication lag, depending on "
"the topology of the network."

"You can use the :rsconf:`settings.chainingAllowed` setting in "

"If chained replication is disabled, you still can use "
":dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` to specify that a secondary replicates from "
"another secondary. But that configuration will last only until the "
"secondary recalculates which member to sync from."
