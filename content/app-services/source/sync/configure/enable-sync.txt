Overview
--------

You can configure and enable Atlas Device Sync via the App Services UI, {+cli+}, or
the Atlas App Services Admin API. You can update an existing configuration in
the same way. If it is your first time enabling Device Sync, the UI is a great
choice because it walks you through the required steps.

You might want to alter your Atlas Device Sync configuration after you have
already enabled Device Sync. You can update a configuration using the same
procedure as enabling Device Sync in the first place. If you're using Flexible
Sync mode, you can update your configuration without needing to terminate and
re-enable Sync.

If you're re-enabling Device Sync after pausing or terminating it, refer to
:ref:`Resume <resume-sync>` or :ref:`Re-Enable <re-enable-realm-sync>` Device
Sync.

.. tip::

   Device Sync pauses automatically after {+sync-inactive-app-pause-time+} 
   of inactivity.

Prerequisites
-------------

If you haven't already decided how you want to configure your data model, see
:ref:`sync-schema-overview`.

Unless you are using :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>`, you must
specify at least one valid :ref:`schema <schemas>` for a collection in the
synced cluster before enabling Sync. At a minimum, the schema must define
``_id`` as a primary key. You should also include the field(s) you intend to use
as your :ref:`queryable fields <queryable-fields>`.

For more details on how to define a schema, see :ref:`enforce-a-schema`.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/note-flexible-sync-prerequisite.rst

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Navigate to the Device Sync Configuration Screen

            To enable Device Sync for your application, navigate to the
            :guilabel:`Device Sync` configuration screen through the left
            navigation menu.

         .. step:: Specify Your Sync Settings

            Follow the prompts to configure Device Sync. For details on the
            available configuration settings, refer to :ref:`sync-settings`.

         .. step:: Turn On Sync

            Click :guilabel:`Enable Sync`, take note of any
            recommendations that appear and then confirm your choice.

     
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

            .. include:: /includes/cli-login.rst

         .. step:: Pull the Latest Version of Your App

            .. include:: /includes/cli-pull-latest.rst

         .. step:: Add a Sync Configuration

            You can enable sync for a single linked cluster in your application.
            If you have not yet linked the cluster to your application, follow the
            :ref:`link-a-data-source` guide first.

            The App Services App has a ``sync`` directory where you can find 
            the :ref:`sync configuration file <appconfig-sync>`. If you have not 
            yet enabled Sync, this directory is empty.

            Add a ``config.json`` similar to:

            .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "type": "flexible",
                 "development_mode_enabled": <Boolean>,
                 "service_name": "<Data Source Name>",
                 "database_name": "<Development Mode Database Name>",
                 "state": <"enabled" | "disabled">,
                 "client_max_offline_days": <Number>,
                 "is_recovery_mode_disabled": <Boolean>,
                 "indexed_queryable_fields_names": <Array of String Field Names>,
                 "queryable_fields_names": <Array of String Field Names>,
                 "collection_queryable_fields_names": <Map[String][]String>
               }
               
            For details, refer to the :ref:`sync-configuration-reference`.

         .. step:: Deploy the Sync Configuration

            Deploy your changes to start syncing data. Import your app
            configuration:

            .. code-block:: shell

               {+cli-bin+} push --remote="<Your App ID>"
     
   .. tab::
      :tabid: api
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Select a Cluster to Sync

            You can enable Device Sync for a single linked cluster in your
            application. If you have not yet linked the cluster to your
            application, follow the :ref:`link-a-data-source` guide.

            .. note:: Authenticating Your Request with an Access Token

              To authenticate your request to the App Services Admin API, you need a valid and
              current authorization token from the MongoDB Cloud API. Read the
              :admin-api-endpoint:`API Authentication <section/Get-Authentication-Tokens>`
              documentation to learn how to acquire a valid access token.

            You'll need the cluster's service configuration file to configure sync. You
            can find the configuration file by :admin-api-endpoint:`listing all services 
            through the Admin API <operation/adminListServices>`:

            .. code-block:: shell
               :caption: Find Your Cluster's Id

               curl https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{GROUP_ID}/apps/{APP_ID}/services \
                 -X GET \
                 -h 'Authorization: Bearer <Valid Access Token>'

            Identify the cluster whose configuration you need to update to enable
            Sync. If you have accepted the default names when configuring 
            your App, this should be a cluster whose ``name`` is ``mongodb-atlas``
            and ``type`` is ``mongodb-atlas``. You need this cluster's ``_id``.

            Now you can :admin-api-endpoint:`get the service configuration file for 
            this cluster <operation/adminGetServiceConfig>`:

            .. code-block:: shell
               :caption: Get the Service Configuration File for the Cluster

               curl https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{GROUP_ID}/apps/{APP_ID}/services/{MongoDB_Service_ID}/config \
                 -X GET \
                 -h 'Authorization: Bearer <Valid Access Token>'

            To configure Sync, we will add a ``flexible_sync`` object to this configuration in a following step.

         .. step:: Enable Development Mode (optional)

            If you would like to enable :ref:`Development Mode <development-mode>` to streamline production, 
            use the following command:

            .. code-block:: shell
               :caption: Enable Development Mode

               curl https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{GROUP_ID}/apps/{APP_ID}/sync/config \
                 -X PUT \
                 -h 'Authorization: Bearer <Valid Access Token>' \
                 -h "Content-Type: application/json" \
                 -d '{"development_mode_enabled": true}'

         .. step:: Add and Deploy the Sync Configuration

            To deploy your changes and start syncing data, send an
            Admin API request that :admin-api-endpoint:`updates the cluster
            configuration <operation/adminUpdateServiceConfig>` with a 
            ``flexible_sync`` object using the following template configuration:

            .. code-block:: shell
               :caption: Update Sync Configuration

               curl https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{GROUP_ID}/apps/{APP_ID}/services/{MongoDB_Service_ID}/config \
                 -X PATCH \
                 -h 'Authorization: Bearer <Valid Access Token>' \
                 -h "Content-Type: application/json" \
                 -d '<Flexible Sync Configuration>'

            .. code-block:: json
               :caption: Flexible Sync Configuration

               {
                 "flexible_sync": {
                   "state": "enabled",
                   "database_name": "<Name of Database>",
                   "client_max_offline_days": <Number>,
                   "is_recovery_mode_disabled": <Boolean>,
                   "indexed_queryable_fields_names": <Array of String Field Names>,
                   "queryable_fields_names": <Array of String Field Names>,
                   "collection_queryable_fields_names": <Map[String][]String>
                 }
               }

            
            For details on the Sync configuration, refer to the :ref:`sync-configuration-reference`.

            You can confirm the Sync configuration is added by getting the service
            configuration again, as described in Step 1.
