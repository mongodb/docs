Querying with natural language in |compass-short| is powered by Generative AI
(Gen AI), and may give inaccurate responses. See our `Generative AI FAQ 
<https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/faq-ai-features>`__ 
for more information about Gen AI in MongoDB products.

Third Party Providers
---------------------

Querying with natural language in |compass-short| currently uses the 
`Azure OpenAI Service <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__ 
hosted by Microsoft.  This is subject to change in the future. 

How Your Data is Used
---------------------

When you query with natural language in |compass-short|, the following 
information is sent to MongoDB's backend and/or the third party 
AI provider: 

- The full text of your natural language prompt.
- The schema of the collection you are querying, 
  including database name, collection name, field names, and types. 

- Enable sending sample field values. This is an optional setting to 
  improve the quality of recommendations. You can manage this through the
  ``Enable sending sample field values`` setting in 
  :ref:`Compass settings <compass-settings-reference>`. This setting 
  is off by default.

The information that is sent will not be shared with any other third 
parties or stored by the AI provider. We do not send database 
connection strings, credentials, or rows/documents from your databases. 

Disable Natural Language Querying
---------------------------------

- Natural language querying in |compass-short| is available if you have 
  enabled the :ref:`Generative AI setting 
  <compass-enable-natural-language-querying>` and logged into Atlas. 
- If you no longer want to use the feature, uncheck 
  :guilabel:`Enable AI Features` in the 
  :guilabel:`Artificial Intelligence` settings. 
- To prevent usage of this feature entirely, you can disable it in the 
  :ref:`global configuration file <config-file>`.
