Follow this tutorial to learn how to convert an existing MongoDB
collection to a **time series collection** using the {+connector+}.

Time series collections efficiently store time series data. Time series
data consists of measurements taken at time intervals, metadata that describes
the measurement, and the time of the measurement.

To convert data from a MongoDB collection to a time series collection using
the connector, you must perform the following tasks:

#. Identify the time field common to all documents in the collection.
#. Configure a source connector to copy the existing collection data to a
   Kafka topic.
#. Configure a sink connector to copy the Kafka topic data to the time series
   collection.

In this tutorial, you perform these preceding tasks to migrate stock data
from a collection to a time series collection. The time series collection
stores and indexes the data more efficiently and retains the ability to analyze
stock performance over time using aggregation operators.

Migrate a Collection to a Time Series Collection
------------------------------------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Complete the Tutorial Setup

      .. include:: /includes/tutorials/setup.rst

   .. step:: Generate Sample Data

      Run the following command to start a script in your Docker environment that generates
      a sample collection containing fabricated stock symbols and their prices
      in your tutorial MongoDB replica set:

      .. code-block:: bash

         docker exec -ti mongo1 /bin/bash -c "cd /stockgenmongo/ && python3 stockgen.py -db Stocks -col PriceData"

      Once the data generator starts running, you should see the generated
      data that resembles the following:

      .. code-block:: bash
         :copyable: false

         ...
         1 _id=528e9... MSP MASSIVE SUBMARINE PARTNERS traded at 31.08 2022-05-25 21:15:15
         2 _id=528e9... RWH RESPONSIVE_WHOLESALER HOLDINGS traded at 18.42 2022-05-25 21:15:15
         3 _id=528e9... FAV FUZZY ATTACK VENTURES traded at 31.08 2022-05-25 21:15:15
         ...

   .. step:: Configure the Source Connector

      In a separate terminal window, create an interactive shell session on the
      tutorial Docker container downloaded for the Tutorial Setup using
      the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         docker exec -it mongo1 /bin/bash

      Create a source configuration file called ``stock-source.json`` with the
      following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         nano stock-source.json

      Paste the following configuration information into the file and save
      your changes:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/time-series/stock-source.json
         :language: json

      This configuration instructs the connector to copy existing data from
      the ``PriceData`` MongoDB collection to the
      ``marketdata.Stocks.PriceData`` Kafka topic, and once complete, any
      future data inserted in that collection.

      Run the following command in the shell to start the source connector
      using the configuration file you created:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cx stock-source.json

      .. note::

         The ``cx`` command is a custom script included in the tutorial
         development environment. This script runs the following
         equivalent request to the Kafka Connect REST API to create a new
         connector:

         .. code-block:: bash

            curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @stock-source.json http://connect:8083/connectors -w "\n"

      Run the following command in the shell to check the status of the
      connectors:

      .. code-block:: bash

         status

      If your source connector started successfully, you should see the
      following output:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/time-series/output/status.out
         :language: text
         :copyable: false

      Once the source connector starts up, confirm the Kafka topic received
      the collection data by running the following command:

      .. code-block::

         kafkacat -b broker:29092 -C -t marketdata.Stocks.PriceData

      The output should show topic data as it is published by the source
      connector that resembles the following:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/time-series/output/kc.out 
         :language: text
         :copyable: false

      You can exit ``kafkacat`` by typing :kbd:`CTRL+C`.

   .. step:: Configure the Sink Connector

      Configure a sink connector to read data from the Kafka topic and write
      it to a time series collection named ``StockDataMigrate`` in a database
      named ``Stocks``.

      Create a sink configuration file called ``stock-sink.json`` with the
      following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         nano stock-sink.json

      Paste the following configuration information into the file and save
      your changes:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/time-series/stock-sink.json 
         :language: json

      .. tip::

         The sink connector configuration above uses the time field date
         format converter. Alternatively, you can use the ``TimestampConverter``
         Single Message Transform (SMT) to convert the ``tx_time`` field from a
         ``String`` to an ``ISODate``. When using the ``TimestampConverter`` SMT,
         you must define a schema for the data in the Kafka topic.

         For information on how to use the ``TimestampConverter`` SMT, see the
         `TimestampConverter <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/transforms/timestampconverter.html#timestampconverter>`__
         Confluent documentation.

      Run the following command in the shell to start the sink connector
      using the configuration file you updated:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cx stock-sink.json

      After your sink connector finishes processing the topic data, the
      documents in the ``StockDataMigrate`` time series collection contain
      the ``tx_time`` field with an ``ISODate`` type value.

   .. step:: Verify the Time Series Collection Data

      Once the sink connector completes processing the topic data, the
      ``StockDataMigrate`` time series collection should contain all the
      market data from your ``PriceData`` collection.

      To view the data in MongoDB, run the following command to connect to
      your replica set using ``mongosh``:

      .. code-block:: shell

         mongosh "mongodb://mongo1"

      At the prompt, type the following commands to retrieve all the
      documents in the ``Stocks.StockDataMigrate`` MongoDB namespace:

      .. code-block:: json

         use Stocks
         db.StockDataMigrate.find()

      You should see a list of documents returned from the command that
      resemble the following document:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/time-series/output/find.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: false

Summary
-------

In this tutorial, you created a stock ticker data generator that periodically
wrote data into a MongoDB collection.
You configured a source connector to copy the data into a Kafka topic and
configured a sink connector to write that data into a new MongoDB time
series collection.
