   A unique :ref:`AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) <security-vpc>` is created
   for each |service| group. All clusters for the group are deployed inside
   this VPC. |service| creates the region-specific VPC for the group during
   deployment of the group's first ``M10+`` cluster. |service| also sets a 
   default VPC :abbr:`CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)` block address
   for the group if no VPC peering connections exist. If you need a 
   specific |service| VPC :abbr:`CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)` block 
   address, configure a :doc:`VPC peering connection </security-vpc-peering>` 
   before creating your first ``M10+`` cluster.
