Download and Compile C++ Driver
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3
   The procedure for compiling the C++ driver has changed, beginning with
   version 2.5.3.

The code for the C++ driver is part of the MongoDB source code. Compiling
the driver involves cloning the MongoDB source code and then compiling the
C++ driver.

The current C++ driver is still
compatible with earlier versions of MongoDB. For example, if you run
MongoDB 2.4, you can use the C++ driver compiled from MongoDB
2.5.3+. If, however, you need instructions for compiling the driver from
the pre-2.5.3 code, see :doc:`/tutorial/download-and-compile-cpp-driver-legacy`.

.. important::

   The C++ driver requires Boost version 1.49 or greater. Earlier versions
   of Boost may work, but the behavior of the driver with those versions
   is untested.

Clone the MongoDB Source Code
-----------------------------

Clone the full MongoDB source code at
`<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo.git>`_. The code for the C++ driver is
part of the MongoDB source code.

.. note:: You may also clone the driver sources from the new independent
   client driver repository at
   `<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/tree/legacy>`_.
   For additional details, please see the blog post describing the reasons
   for migrating to this new repository:
   `<http://blog.mongodb.org/post/78478565493/upcoming-changes-to-the-mongodb-cpp-driver>`_.
   The build instructions listed below should work without modifcation for
   the sources in the new repository.
   
Building the Driver
-------------------

From the directory where you cloned the code, compile the C++ driver by
running the ``scons`` command. Use the ``scons`` options described in this
section.

To see the list of all SCons options, run:

.. code-block:: javascript

   scons --help

.. note:: Many of the options listed when you run ``scons --help`` are
   relevant only to building the server and tools, and can be ignored.

SCons Options when Compiling the C++ Driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select options as appropriate for your environment.

- ``--prefix=<path>``. The directory prefix for the installation
  directory. Set ``<path>`` to the directory where you want the build
  artifacts (headers and library files) installed. For example, you might
  set ``<path>`` to ``/opt/local``, ``/usr/local``, or
  ``$HOME/mongo-client-install``.

- ``--full``. Enables the "full" installation, directing SCons to install
  the driver headers and libraries to the prefix directory.

- ``--ssl``. Enables SSL support. You will need a compatible version of
  the SSL libraries available.

- ``--use-sasl-client``. Enables SASL, which MongoDB uses for the Kerberos
  authentication available on :manual:`MongoDB Enterprise
  </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise>`. You will need a compatible
  version of the SASL implementation libraries available.

- ``--sharedclient``. Builds a shared library version of the client
  driver alongside the static library. If applicable for your application,
  prefer using the shared client.

- ``--use-system-boost``. This is strongly recommended. This builds
  against the system version of Boost rather than the MongoDB vendor copy.
  If your Boost libraries are not in a standard search path for your
  toolchain, include the ``--extrapath`` option, described next.

  .. note:: While the C++ driver should in general be built against the
     system version of Boost, if you are building the MongoDB servers and
     tools from source, it is strongly recommended that you use the
     embedded version of Boost. This means that your build line for the
     driver and server will differ with respect to the
     ``--use-system-boost`` flag.

- ``--extrapath=<path-to-boost>``. Specifies the path to your Boost
  libraries if they are not in a standard search path for your toolchain.

- ``install-mongoclient``. This is the build target.

- ``--dbg=[on|off]``. Enables runtime debugging checks. Defaults to
  ``off``. Specifying ``--dbg=on`` implies ``--opt=off`` unless explicitly
  overridden with ``--opt=on``.

- ``--opt=[on|off]``. Enables compile-time optimization. Defaults to
  ``on``. Can be freely mixed with the values for the ``--dbg`` flag.

- ``--cc``. The compiler to use for C. Use the following syntax:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     --cc=<path-to-c-compiler>

- ``--cxx``. The compiler to use for C++. Use the following syntax:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     --cxx=<path-to-c++-compiler>

- ``--dynamic-windows``. By default, on Windows, compilation uses ``/MT``.
  Use this flag to compile with ``/MD``. Note that ``/MD`` is required to
  build the shared client on Windows. Also note that your application
  compiler flags must match.

  If you build with ``--dbg=on``, ``/MTd`` or ``/MDd`` will be used in place of
  ``/MT`` or ``/MD``, respectively.

Windows Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- When building on Windows, use of the SCons ``--dynamic-windows`` option
  can result in an error unless all libraries and sources for the
  application use the same runtime library.
  This option builds the driver to link against
  the dynamic windows libraries instead of the static windows runtime
  libraries. If the Boost library being linked against is expecting an
  ``/MT`` build (static libraries), this can result in an error similar to
  the following:

  .. code-block:: none

     error LNK2005: ___ already defined in msvcprt.lib(MSVCP100.dll) libboost_thread-vc100-mt-1_42.lib(thread.obj)

- You may want to define ``_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS`` to avoid warnings on
  use of ``strncpy`` and such by the MongoDB client code.

- Include the ``WinSock`` library in your application:
  :menuselection:`Linker --> Input --> Additional Dependencies`. Add
  :file:`ws2_32.lib`.

Example C++ Driver Compilations
-------------------------------

The following are examples of building the C++ driver.

The following example installs the new driver to
``$HOME/mongo-client-install``, enables the "full" installation, and
builds against the system version of Boost:

.. code-block:: javascript

   scons --prefix=$HOME/mongo-client-install --full --use-system-boost install-mongoclient

To enable SSL, add the ``--ssl`` option:

.. code-block:: javascript

   scons --prefix=$HOME/mongo-client-install --full --use-system-boost --ssl install-mongoclient

To enable SASL support for use with Kerberos authentication on
:manual:`MongoDB Enterprise </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise>`, add the
``--use-sasl-client`` option:

.. code-block:: javascript

   scons --prefix=$HOME/mongo-client-install --full --use-system-boost --use-sasl-client install-mongoclient

To build a shared library version of the driver, along with the normal
static library, use the ``--sharedclient`` option:

.. code-block:: javascript

   scons --prefix=$HOME/mongo-client-install --full --use-system-boost --sharedclient install-mongoclient

To use a custom version of boost installed to ``/dev/boost``, use the
``--extrapath=<path-to-boost>`` option:

.. code-block:: javascript

   scons --prefix=$HOME/mongo-client-install --full --use-system-boost --extrapath=/dev/boost install-mongoclient

To build a version of the library with debugging enabled, use
``--dbg=on``. This turns off optimization, which is ``on`` by default. To
enable both debugging and optimization, pass ``--dbg=on --opt=on``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   scons --prefix=$HOME/mongo-client-install --full --use-system-boost --dbg=on --opt=on install-mongoclient

To override the default compiler to a newer GCC installed in
``/opt/local/gcc-4.8``, use the ``--cc`` and ``--cxx`` options:

.. code-block:: javascript

   scons --prefix=$HOME/mongo-client-install --full --use-system-boost --cc=/opt/local/gcc-4.8/bin/gcc --cxx=/opt/local/gcc-4.8/bin/g++ install-mongoclient

To build as a DLL on Windows:

.. versionadded:: 2.5.5

.. code-block:: shell

   scons <--64 or --32> --mute --sharedclient --dynamic-windows --release --full --prefix=<install-path> --use-system-boost --cpppath=<path-to-boost-headers> --libpath=<path-to-boost-libs> --variant-dir=<path-to-a-variant-directory> install-mongoclient

The following example issues the build command in a PowerShell:

.. code-block:: 2.5.5

   scons `
       --64 `
       --mute `
       --sharedclient `
       --dynamic-windows `
       --release `
       --full `
       --prefix=%HOME%\mongo-client-install `
       --use-system-boost `
       --cpppath=C:\local\boost_1_55_0\include `
       --libpath=C:\local\boost_1_55_0\lib64-msvc-12.0 `
       --variant-dir=%HOME%\mongo-client-build `
       install-mongoclient

.. note::

   - You must configure Visual Studio for *release builds* when
     building your application with the C++ driver DLL.

   - Disable STL iterator debugging to ensure compatibility with the
     STL binary.

   - You must use `Boost v1.49 or greater <http://www.boost.org>`_.
