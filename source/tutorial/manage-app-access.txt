To grant applications access to an organization or project using only
the :doc:`API </api>`, you can create an |api| Key for that
application. |api| Keys:

- Have two parts: a Public Key and a Private Key. These serve the same
  function as a username and User |api| Key when making |api| requests
  to |service|.

- Cannot be used to log into |service| through the user interface.

- Must be granted roles as you would Users to make sure the |api| Keys
  can call |api| endpoints without errors.

- Can belong to one organization, but may be granted access to
  any number of projects in that organization.
