========================================
Enable MongoDB Role-Based Access Control
========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MongoDB uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to determine access to a
MongoDB system. When run with access control, MongoDB requires users to
authenticate themselves to determine their access. MongoDB limits each
user to the resources and actions allowed by the user's roles. If you
leave access control disabled, any client can access any database in your
deployments and perform any action.

When you enable MongoDB access control, you enable it for all the
deployments in your |mms| group. The group shares one set of users
for all deployments, but each user has permissions only for specific
resources.

Access control applies to the |mms| agents as well as to clients. When you
enable access control, |mms| creates the appropriate users for the agents.

Considerations
--------------

Once you enable access control, you must :doc:`create MongoDB users
</tutorial/manage-mongodb-users>` so that clients can access your
databases. Always use the |mms| interface to manage users and roles. Do not
do so through direct connection to a MongoDB instance.

When you enable access control, |mms| creates a user with global privileges
used only by the Automation Agent. |mms| also creates users for the
Monitoring and Backup agents if they are managed by |mms|. 
The first user you create can be any
type of user, as the Automation Agent guarantees you will always have
access to user management.

For more information on MongoDB access control, see the
:manual:`Authentication </core/authentication>` and :manual:`Authorization
</core/authorization>` pages in the MongoDB manual.

Enable MongoDB Access Control
-----------------------------

|mms| supports various authentication mechanisms. You can choose which
mechanisms you wish to use when you enable access control / authentication.

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-access-control.rst

``MONGODB-CR``/``SCRAM-SHA-1`` authentication is the only authentication
mechanism available in |mms| when using the MongoDB Community version.

For detailed instructions for configuring the different authentication
mechanisms, see: :doc:`/tutorial/nav/security-enable-authentication`
