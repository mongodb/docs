      [mongodb-enterprise]
      name=MongoDB Enterprise Repository
      baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.com/yum/amazon/2013.03/mongodb-enterprise/3.4/$basearch/

      ``.repo`` files for each release can also be found `in the repository itself <https://repo.mongodb.com/yum/amazon/>`_.

      for production deployment.
