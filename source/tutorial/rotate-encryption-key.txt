Most regulatory requirements mandate that a managed key used to decrypt
sensitive data must be rotated out and replaced with a new key once a
year.

MongoDB provides two options for key rotation. You can rotate out the
binary with a new instance that uses a new key. Or, if you are using a
KMIP server for key management, you can rotate the master key.

Rotate a Member of Replica Set
------------------------------

For a replica set, to rotate out a member:

#. Start a new :program:`mongod` instance, configured to use a new key.
   Include the ``--replSet`` option with the name of the replica set as
   well as any other options specific to your configuration, such as
   ``--dbpath``.

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --replSet myReplSet --enableEncryption --kmipServerName
      <KMIP Server HostName> \ --kmipServerCAFile ca.pem
      --kmipClientCertificateFile client.pem

#. Connect a :program:`mongo` shell to the replica set's primary.

#. Add the instance to the replica set.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.add("<hostname>:<port>")

   During the initial sync process, the re-encryption of the data with
   an entirely new set of database keys as well as a new system key
   occurs.

#. Once the new node completes its initial sync process, remove the old
   node from the replica set and delete all its data. For instructions,
   see :doc:`/tutorial/remove-replica-set-member`

.. _kmip-master-key-rotation:

KMIP Master Key Rotation
------------------------

If you are using a KMIP server for key management, you can rotate
the master key, the only externally managed key. With the new
master key, the internal keystore will be re-encrypted but the
database keys will be otherwise left unchanged. This obviates the need
to re-encrypt the entire data set.

#. Rotate the master key for the :ref:`secondary
   <replica-set-secondary-members>` members of the replica set one at a
   time.

   a. Restart the secondary, including the
      :option:`--kmipRotateMasterKey` parameter. Include any other
      options specific to your configuration. If the member already
      includes the :option:`--kmipKeyIdentifier` option, either update
      the :option:`--kmipKeyIdentifier` option with the new key to use
      or omit to request a new key from the KMIP server:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --enableEncryption --kmipRotateMasterKey \
           --kmipServerName <KMIP Server HostName> \
           --kmipServerCAFile ca.pem --kmipClientCertificateFile client.pem

      If using a configuration file, include the
      :setting:`security.kmip.rotateMasterKey`.

   b. Upon successful completion of the master key rotation and
      re-encryption of the database keystore, the :program:`mongod`
      will exit.

   c. Restart the secondary without the :option:`--kmipRotateMasterKey`
      parameter. Include any other options specific to your
      configuration.

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --enableEncryption --kmipServerName <KMIP Server HostName> \
           --kmipServerCAFile ca.pem --kmipClientCertificateFile client.pem

      If using a configuration file, remove the
      :setting:`security.kmip.rotateMasterKey` setting.

#. Step down the replica set primary.

   Connect a :program:`mongo` shell to the primary and use
   :method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and force an
   election of a new primary:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.stepDown()

#. When :method:`rs.status()`
   shows that the primary has stepped down and another member
   has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, rotate the master key for the stepped down member:

   a. Restart the stepped-down member, including the
      :option:`--kmipRotateMasterKey` parameter. Include any other
      options specific to your configuration. If the member already
      includes the :option:`--kmipKeyIdentifier` option, either update
      the :option:`--kmipKeyIdentifier` option with the new key to use
      or omit.

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --enableEncryption --kmipRotateMasterKey \
           --kmipServerName <KMIP Server HostName> \
           --kmipServerCAFile ca.pem --kmipClientCertificateFile client.pem

      If using a configuration file, include the
      :setting:`security.kmip.rotateMasterKey`.

   b. Upon successful completion of the master key rotation and
      re-encryption of the database keystore, the :program:`mongod`
      will exit.

   c. Restart the stepped-down member without the
      :option:`--kmipRotateMasterKey` parameter. Include any other options
      specific to your configuration.

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --enableEncryption --kmipServerName <KMIP Server HostName> \
           --kmipServerCAFile ca.pem --kmipClientCertificateFile client.pem

      If using a configuration file, remove the
      :setting:`security.kmip.rotateMasterKey` setting.
