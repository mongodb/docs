.. dbcommand:: moveChunk

   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` is an internal administrative command that
   moves :term:`chunks <chunk>` between :term:`shards <shard>`.
   You must issue the
   :dbcommand:`moveChunk`
   command against the :term:`admin database` in the form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { moveChunk : <namespace> ,
                       find : <query> ,
                       to : <destination>,
                       <options> } )

   :param namespace moveChunk:

      The name of the :term:`collection` where the :term:`chunk`
      exists. Specify the collection's full namespace, including the
      database name.

   :param document find:

      A document including the :term:`shard key`.

   :param host to:

      The identifier of the shard, that you want to migrate the chunk
      to.

   :param boolean _secondaryThrottle:

      Optional. Set to ``false`` by default. If set to ``true``, the
      balancer waits for replication to :term:`secondaries
      <secondary>` while copying and deleting data during
      migrations. For details, see
      :ref:`sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle`.

   Use the :method:`sh.moveChunk()` helper in the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
   shell to migrate chunks manually.

   The :ref:`chunk migration <sharding-chunk-migration>` section
   describes how chunks move between shards on MongoDB.

   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` will return the following if another cursor
   is using the chunk you are moving:

   .. code-block:: none

      errmsg: "The collection's metadata lock is already taken."

   These errors usually occur when there are too many open
   :term:`cursors <cursor>` accessing the chunk you are migrating. You
   can either wait until the cursors complete their operation or close
   the cursors manually.

   .. note::

      Only use the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` in special circumstances
      such as preparing your :term:`sharded cluster` for an initial
      ingestion of data, or a large bulk import operation. See
      :ref:`sharding-administration-create-chunks` for more information.
