"Aggregations operations process data records and return computed results."
" Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together, "
"and can perform a variety of operations on the grouped data to return a "
"single result. MongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: the "
":ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-framework>`, the :ref:`map-reduce"
" function <aggregation-map-reduce>`, and :ref:`single purpose aggregation"
" methods <single-purpose-agg-operations>`."

"MongoDB also provides :doc:`map-reduce </core/map-reduce>` operations to "
"perform aggregation. In general, map-reduce operations have two phases: a"
" *map* stage that processes each document and *emits* one or more objects"
" for each input document, and *reduce* phase that combines the output of "
"the map operation. Optionally, map-reduce can have a *finalize* stage to "
"make final modifications to the result. Like other aggregation "
"operations, map-reduce can specify a query condition to select the input "
"documents as well as sort and limit the results."
