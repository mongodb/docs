You can query your {+fdi+} using {+asql+}. This capability allows you 
to create SQL queries to visualize, graph, and report on your 
|service| data using relational business intelligence tools such as 
`Tableau <https://www.tableau.com/>`__.

.. note::
   
   {+asql+} only supports reading through {+adf+}.

The SQL interface is available by default when you create a {+fdi+}. 
{+adf+} automatically creates collection schemas for SQL query 
compilation and type inference.. To learn more about the 
schema, see :ref:`Schema Management <sql-schema-management>`.

To run queries using the SQL interface, connect using the 
`MongoDB JDBC Driver <https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mongodb/mongodb-jdbc>`__
or one of the BI tool Named Connectors. To learn more about the 
different connect options, see :ref:`Connect <sql-connect>`.

Components
----------

The SQL interface includes the following components:

{+FDI+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A {+fdi+} is a deployment of {+adf+}. Each {+fdi+} contains virtual 
databases and collections that map to data in your data stores. This 
also provides a SQL schema and translates SQL queries between 
your BI tool and your |service| data.

JDBC Driver or Named Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The JDBC Driver or a Named Connector provides a standard method to 
connect to a BI tool. Depending on what your BI tool supports, you can 
use JDBC or a specific Named Connector.

BI Tool
~~~~~~~
A visualization and reporting tool, such as Tableau.
