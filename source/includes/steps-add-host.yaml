  :guilabel:`Host Type` is the type of MongoDB deployment.

  :guilabel:`Internal Hostname`: the hostname of the MongoDB instance as
  seen from the Monitoring Agent.

  :guilabel:`Port` is port on which the MongoDB instance runs.

  :guilabel:`Auth Mechanism`: the :manual:`authentication mechanism
  </core/authentication>` used by the host. ``Username/Password
  (MONGODB-CR)`` is MongoDB's default authentication method.

  :guilabel:`DB Username` and :guilabel:`DB Password`: if the
  authentication mechanism is MONGODB-CR or LDAP, these are the
  credentials the Monitoring Agent uses to authenticate to the MongoDB
  deployment.

  :guilabel:`My deployment supports SSL for MongoDB connections`: if this
  is checked, the Monitoring Agent must have a trusted CA certificate in
  order to connect to the MongoDB instances.
