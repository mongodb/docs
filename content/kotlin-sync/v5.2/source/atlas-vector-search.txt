Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform
:atlas:`{+vector-search+} </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>`
queries. The ``Aggregates`` builders class provides the
``vectorSearch()`` helper method, which you can use to
create a :atlas:`$vectorSearch </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage/>`
pipeline stage. 

.. important:: Feature Compatibility

   To learn which versions of MongoDB Atlas support this feature, see
   :atlas:`Limitations </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage/#limitations>`
   in the MongoDB Atlas documentation.

Perform a Vector Search
-----------------------

Before you can perform {+vector-search+} queries, you must create a {+vector-search+}
index on your collection. To learn how to programmatically create a
vector search index, see the :ref:`kotlin-sync-search-avs-indexes` guide.

Then, you can run a {+vector-search+} query by using the
``vectorSearch()`` method in an aggregation pipeline. This
method accepts the following parameters:

- ``path``: The field to search
- ``queryVector``: The vector embedding that represents your search query
- ``indexName``: The name of the {+vector-search+} index to use
- ``limit``: The maximum number of results to return
- ``options``: *(Optional)* A set of options that you can use to configure the
  vector search query

Basic Vector Search Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example runs a {+vector-search+} query that performs the following actions:

- Queries the ``plot_embedding`` vector field.
- Limits the results to ``5`` documents.
- Specifies an Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) vector search that considers
  ``150`` candidates. To learn more about ANN searches, see :atlas:`ANN Search </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage/#ann-search>`
  in the MongoDB Atlas documentation.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/vector-search.kt
      :start-after: start-vs
      :end-before: end-vs
      :language: kotlin
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false
        
      {"title": "Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King"}
      {"title": "Rollerball"}
      {"title": "After Life"}
      {"title": "What Women Want"}
      {"title": "Truth About Demons"}

.. tip:: Query Vector Type

   The preceding example creates an instance of ``BinaryVector`` to
   serve as the query vector, but you can also create a ``List`` of
   ``Double`` instances. However, we recommend that you use the
   ``BinaryVector`` type to improve storage efficiency.

Vector Search Score Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows how to run same vector search
query as the preceding example and print the documents' vector search
meta-score. This score represents the relevance of each
document to the query vector:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/vector-search.kt
      :start-after: start-vs-score
      :end-before: end-vs-score
      :language: kotlin
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false
        
      Title: Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King, Score: 0.49899211525917053
      Title: Rollerball, Score: 0.4976102113723755
      Title: After Life, Score: 0.4965665936470032
      Title: What Women Want, Score: 0.49622756242752075
      Title: Truth About Demons, Score: 0.49614521861076355
