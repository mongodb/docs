stepnum: 1

  Create the :term:`data directory <dbpath>` where MongoDB stores data.
  MongoDB's default data directory path is the absolute path
  ``\data\db`` on the drive from which you start MongoDB.

  From the :guilabel:`Command Interpreter`, create the data directories:

  .. code-block:: bat

     cd C:\
     md "\data\db"

---
title: Start your MongoDB database.
stepnum: 2
ref: start
content: |

  To start MongoDB, run :binary:`mongod.exe`.

  .. code-block:: bat

     "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="c:\data\db"

  The :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option points to your
  database directory.

  If the MongoDB database server is running correctly, the
  :guilabel:`Command Interpreter` displays:

  .. code-block:: bash

     [initandlisten] waiting for connections

  .. important::

     Depending on the
     `Windows Defender Firewall <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/>`__
     settings on your Windows host, Windows may display a
     :guilabel:`Security Alert` dialog box about blocking
     "some features" of ``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin\mongod.exe``
     from communicating on networks. To remedy this issue:

     a. Click :guilabel:`Private Networks, such as my home or work
        network`.
     b. Click :guilabel:`Allow access`.

     To learn more about security and MongoDB, see the
     :ref:`Security Documentation <security>`.

title: Connect to MongoDB.
stepnum: 3
ref: connect
content: |
  If you have not already done so, follow the
  :mongosh:`mongosh installation instructions </install>` to download
  and install the MongoDB Shell (:mongosh:`mongosh </>`).

  Be sure to add the path to your ``mongosh.exe`` binary to your
  ``PATH`` environment variable during installation.

  Open a new :guilabel:`Command Interpreter` and enter ``mongosh.exe``
  to connect to MongoDB.

  For more information on connecting to ``mongod`` using
  :mongosh:`mongosh.exe </>`, such as connecting to a MongoDB instance
  running on a different host and/or port, see
  :mongosh:`Connect to a Deployment </connect>`.
