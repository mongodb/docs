Activate Backup for a Sharded Cluster
=====================================

.. start-content

.. note::
   The sharded-cluster must be MongoDB version 2.4.3 or later.

To backup a cluster,

#. Go to :guilabel:`Backup`.

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Sharded Cluster Status` tab to see the list of your
   clusters and their backup details.

#. For the sharded cluster you want to enable, select
   :guilabel:`Start` in the :guilabel:`Action` column.

#. Specify which instances to use for the initial sync. To
   minimize the impact on the primaries, sync off of the secondaries.

Your MongoDB Backup Service Agent will start polling the the specified
instance for this sharded cluster.
