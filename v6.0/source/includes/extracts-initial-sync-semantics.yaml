  Starting in MongoDB 5.0, a newly added secondary does not count as a
  voting member and cannot be elected until it has reached the
  :replstate:`SECONDARY` state.

  When a new voting node is added to a replica set,
  :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` will internally add a ``newlyAdded``
  field to the node's configuration. Nodes with the ``newlyAdded`` field
  do not count towards the current number of voting nodes. When initial
  sync completes and the node reaches :replstate:`SECONDARY` state, the
  ``newlyAdded`` field is automatically removed.

  .. note::

     - Configurations that attempt to add a field named ``newlyAdded``
       will error even if run with ``{ force: true }``.

     - If an existing node has a ``newlyAdded`` field, using
       :method:`rs.reconfig()` to change the configuration will not
       remove the ``newlyAdded`` field. The ``newlyAdded`` field will be
       appended to the user provided configuration.

     - :dbcommand:`replSetGetConfig` will remove any ``newlyAdded`` fields
       from its output. If you would like to see any ``newlyAdded``
       fields, you can query the :data:`local.system.replset` collection
       directly.
