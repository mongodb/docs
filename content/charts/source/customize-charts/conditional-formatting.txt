|charts| provides conditional formatting options which modify the 
styling of individual chart values based on conditions you define.
Conditional formatting is available for :ref:`Table <data-table-ref>`
and :ref:`Number <number-chart-ref>` charts.

To view your existing rules or to add, edit, or delete a rule, expand 
the :guilabel:`Conditional Formatting` section of the 
:guilabel:`Customize` tab.

Applying Multiple Rules
-----------------------

Multiple conditional formatting rules can affect the 
styling of the same value.

Conditional formatting rules take precedence in the order you put 
them in. Rule ``1`` overwrites rule ``2`` in cases where both 
rules affect the same styling of a value.

.. example::
   
   The following conditional formatting rules both apply to a value:
   
   1. White text
   2. Black text, green background

   The value's text is white because rule ``1`` takes precedence. The 
   background is green because both rules apply.

Use Case
--------

Conditional formatting can help clarify the insights that your chart 
provides. The following example uses conditional formatting to
highlight slight shifts in critical reception and runtime in movies 
of the 2000s.

         Movie statistics are displayed by year and colored with a gradient that highlights shifting trends.
