You can modify a deployment's configuration and topology, including its
MongoDB versions, storage engines, and numbers of hosts or shards. You
can make modifications at all levels of a deployment's topology from a
top-level :term:`sharded cluster <sharded cluster>` or
:term:`replica set` to lower levels, such as a replica set within a
sharded cluster, or an individual process within a replica set. You can
also modify :term:`standalone <standalone>` processes.

Prerequisites
-------------

To update a MongoDB |k8s-obj|, you need to have completed the following procedures:

- :doc:`/installation`
- :doc:`/tutorial/create-operator-credentials`
- :doc:`/tutorial/create-project-using-configmap`
- :doc:`Deploy a database </deploy>`

Procedure
---------

1. Edit the |k8s| resource specification file.

2. Modify or add any settings you need added or changed.

3. Save your specification file.

4. Invoke the following |k8s| command to update your resource.

   .. code-block:: sh

      kubectl apply -f <standalone-conf>.yaml

.. note::

   - Changes cannot be made to individual members of a replica set or
     sharded cluster, only to the whole set or cluster.

   - If a setting is not available for a MongoDB Kubernetes resource,
     then the change must be made in the |application|.

   - You can set some settings using |k8s-op-short| only. To review the
     list of settings, see :doc:`/reference/k8s-op-exclusive-settings`.
