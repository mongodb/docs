     * - Field

       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`User Name`

       - The user's login name.

     * - :guilabel:`Database`

       - The database to which the user authenticates. 
       
         The user's name and authentication database serve as a unique
         identifier for that user. That is, if two users have the same
         name but are created in different databases, they are two
         separate users.

         .. note::

            A user's access is not restricted by this selection. By
            assigning to the user roles in other databases, a user
            created in one database can have permissions to act on
            other databases.

     * - :guilabel:`Roles`

       - The actions a user can perform on specified databases. A given role
         can be granted for a specific database or for all databases. You can
         assign a user different roles on different databases. You can assign
         the following roles:

         - :authrole:`backup`

         - :authrole:`clusterMonitor`

         - ``enableSharding``:

           Allows the MongoDB user to enable sharding on a database and to
           shard a collection. See the :authaction:`enableSharding` privilege
           action in the MongoDB manual.

         - :authrole:`read`

         - :authrole:`readAnyDatabase`

         - :authrole:`readWrite`

         - :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase`

         For more information on roles, see :manual:`Role-Based Access Control
         </core/authorization>` in the MongoDB manual.

     * - :guilabel:`Password`

       - The user's password. Users can change their passwords.
