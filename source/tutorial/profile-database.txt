The Query Profiler diagnoses and monitors performance issues. This
monitoring can expose slow-running queries and their key performance
statistics in the |service| UI. You can explore a sample of historical
queries for up to last 24 hours without additional cost or performance
overhead for M10+ clusters.

|service| collects and displays statistics from any of your mongod
instances. Atlas displays this data in the :guilabel:`Profiler` section
of an instance. To access the query profiler, click :guilabel:`Metrics`
for that instance in the project panel then click :guilabel:`Profiler`.

The :guilabel:`Profiler` displays one aspect, like *Operation Execution
Time*, that could reveal slow database operations over a set time
frame. It displays this data in both a chart and a table that each can
filter on aspect and time frame.

Considerations
--------------

.. important:: Please read the following considerations before you enable profiling.

Security
~~~~~~~~

Profile data may include sensitive information including the content of
database queries. Ensure that exposing this data to |service| is
consistent with your information security practices.

Data Display Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| displays no more than 10,000 data points in the
:guilabel:`Profiler` charts.

Log data is processed in batches. Data can be delayed up to five
minutes from realtime.

Enable and Disable Profiling
----------------------------

|service| enables Profiling by default.

To disable profiling:

1. Click :guilabel:`Project Settings` in the left navigation.
#. Toggle :guilabel:`Performance Advisor and Profiler` to
   :guilabel:`Off`.

Your mongod instance collects profile data for operations longer than
the slow operation threshold and report them to |service|. The
threshold for slow operations applies to the entire mongod instance.
|service| defaults this threshold to 100 ms. You can't change this
threshold through the |service| interface.
