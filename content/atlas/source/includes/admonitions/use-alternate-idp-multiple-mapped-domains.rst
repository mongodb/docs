.. important::

   When you map a single domain to multiple identity providers, users
   who log in using the MongoDB Cloud console are automatically
   redirected to the |idp| associated with the first |saml| |idp|
   application that was configured for {+service+}. 

   To use an alternative identity provider, users must log in
   through either an SP-initiated or IdP-initiated login URL.
