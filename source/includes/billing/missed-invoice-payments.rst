If your organization fails to pay at least one invoice for over 30 days, we
suspend your MongoDB |service| account and automatically stop your backups without
terminating them. You must pay any outstanding bills to resume service. 

If your organization fails to pay an invoice balance for over 60 days, we
lock your MongoDB |service| account and can terminate backups and |service| deployments
connected to your account. You must pay all outstanding bills to resume service.
