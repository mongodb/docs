This tutorial discusses using the core Ruby BSON gem.

Installation
------------

The BSON gem is hosted on `Rubygems <http://rubygems.org>`_ and can be installed
manually or with bundler.

To install the gem manually:

.. code-block:: sh

    gem install bson -v '~> 4.0'

To install the gem with bundler, include the following in your Gemfile:

.. code-block:: ruby

    gem 'bson', '~> 4.0'

The BSON gem is compatible with MRI >= 1.9.3, JRuby 1.7.x, and Rubinius 2.5.x

BSON Serialization
------------------

Getting a Ruby object's raw BSON representation is done by calling ``to_bson``
on the Ruby object, which will return a ``BSON::ByteBuffer``. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day".to_bson
  1024.to_bson

Generating an object from BSON is done via calling ``from_bson`` on the class
you wish to instantiate and passing it a ``BSON::ByteBuffer`` instance.

.. code-block:: ruby

  String.from_bson(byte_buffer)
  BSON::Int32.from_bson(byte_buffer)

Byte Buffers
------------

In 4.0, BSON introduced the use of native byte buffers in both MRI and JRuby
instead of using ``StringIO``. This was done for performance improvements.

API
```

A ``BSON::ByteBuffer`` can be instantiated with nothing (for write mode) or
with a string of raw bytes (for read mode).

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new # a write mode buffer.
  buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new(string) # a read mode buffer.

Writing to the buffer is done via the following API:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.put_byte(value) # Appends a single byte.
  buffer.put_cstring(value) # Appends a null-terminated string.
  buffer.put_double(value) # Appends a 64-bit floating point.
  buffer.put_int32(value) # Appends a 32-bit integer (4 bytes).
  buffer.put_int64(value) # Appends a 64-bit integer (8 bytes).
  buffer.put_string(value) # Appends a UTF-8 string.

Reading from the buffer is done via the following API:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.get_byte # Pulls a single byte from the buffer.
  buffer.get_bytes(value) # Pulls n number of bytes from the buffer.
  buffer.get_cstring # Pulls a null-terminated string from the buffer.
  buffer.get_double # Pulls a 64-bit floating point from the buffer.
  buffer.get_int32 # Pulls a 32-bit integer (4 bytes) from the buffer.
  buffer.get_int64 # Pulls a 64-bit integer (8 bytes) from the buffer.
  buffer.get_string # Pulls a UTF-8 string from the buffer.

Converting a buffer to its raw bytes (for example, for sending over a socket)
is done by simply calling ``to_s`` on the buffer.

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new
  buffer.put_string('testing')
  socket.write(buffer.to_s)

Supported Objects
-----------------

Core Ruby objects that have representations in the BSON specification and
will have a ``to_bson`` method defined for them are: ``Object``, ``Array``,
``FalseClass``, ``Float``, ``Hash``, ``Integer``, ``NilClass``, ``Regexp``,
``String``, ``Symbol`` (deprecated), ``Time``, ``TrueClass``.

In addition to the core Ruby objects, BSON also provides some special types
specific to the specification:

``BSON::Binary``
````````````````

This is a representation of binary data. The raw data and a subtype must be
provided when constructing.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Binary.new(binary_data, :md5)

Valid subtypes are: ``:generic``, ``:function``, ``:old``, ``:uuid_old``,
``:uuid``, ``:md5``, ``:user``.

``BSON::Code``
``````````````

Represents a string of JavaScript code.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Code.new("this.value = 5;")

``BSON::CodeWithScope``
```````````````````````

Represents a string of JavaScript code with a hash of values.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::CodeWithScope.new("this.value = age;", age: 5)

``BSON::Document``
``````````````````

This is a subclass of ``Hash`` that stores all keys as strings, but allows
access to them with symbol keys.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Document[:key, "value"]
  BSON::Document.new

``BSON::MaxKey``
````````````````

Represents a value in BSON that will always compare higher to another value.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::MaxKey.new

``BSON::MinKey``
````````````````

Represents a value in BSON that will always compare lower to another value.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::MinKey.new

``BSON::ObjectId``
``````````````````

Represents a 12 byte unique identifier for an object on a given machine.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::ObjectId.new

``BSON::Timestamp``
```````````````````

Represents a special time with a start and increment value.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Timestamp.new(5, 30)

``BSON::Undefined``
```````````````````

Represents a placeholder for a value that was not provided.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Undefined.new

``BSON::Decimal128``
````````````````````

Represents a 128-bit decimal-based floating-point value capable of emulating
decimal rounding with exact precision.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Instantiate with a String
  BSON::Decimal128.new("1.28")

  # Instantiate with a BigDecimal
  d = BigDecimal.new(1.28, 3)
  BSON::Decimal128.new(d)

JSON Serialization
------------------

Some BSON types have special representations in JSON. These are as follows
and will be automatically serialized in the form when calling ``to_json`` on
them.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 105

   * - Object
     - JSON

   * - ``BSON::Binary``
     - ``{ "$binary" : "\x01", "$type" : "md5" }``

   * - ``BSON::Code``
     - ``{ "$code" : "this.v = 5 }``

   * - ``BSON::CodeWithScope``
     - ``{ "$code" : "this.v = value", "$scope" : { v => 5 }}``

   * - ``BSON::MaxKey``
     - ``{ "$maxKey" : 1 }``

   * - ``BSON::MinKey``
     - ``{ "$minKey" : 1 }``

   * - ``BSON::ObjectId``
     - ``{ "$oid" : "4e4d66343b39b68407000001" }``

   * - ``BSON::Timestamp``
     - ``{ "t" : 5, "i" : 30 }``

   * - ``Regexp``
     - ``{ "$regex" : "[abc]", "$options" : "i" }``


Special Ruby Date Classes
-------------------------

Ruby's ``Date`` and ``DateTime`` are able to be serialized, but when they are
deserialized, they will always be returned as a ``Time`` since the BSON
specification only has a ``Time`` type and knows nothing about Ruby.


Using Regexes
-----------------

Ruby regular expressions always have BSON regular expression's equivalent of 'm' on.
In order for behavior to be preserved between the two, the 'm' option is always added
when a Ruby regular expression is serialized to BSON.

There is a class provided by the bson gem, ``Regexp::Raw``, to allow Ruby users to get around this.
You can simply create a regular expression like this:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Regexp::Raw.new("^b403158")

This code example illustrates the difference between serializing a core Ruby ``Regexp`` versus a
``Regexp::Raw`` object:

.. code-block:: ruby

  regexp_ruby = /^b403158/
  # => /^b403158/
  regexp_ruby.to_bson
  # => #<BSON::ByteBuffer:0x007fcf20ab8028>
  _.to_s
  # => "^b403158\x00m\x00"
  regexp_raw = Regexp::Raw.new("^b403158")
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x007fcf21808f98 @pattern="^b403158", @options="">
  regexp_raw.to_bson
  # => #<BSON::ByteBuffer:0x007fcf213622f0>
  _.to_s
  # => "^b403158\x00\x00"


Please use the ``Regexp::Raw`` class to instantiate your BSON regular expressions to get the exact
pattern and options you want.

When regular expressions are deserialized, they return a wrapper that holds the
raw regex string, but do not compile it. In order to get the Ruby ``Regexp``
object, one must call ``compile`` on the returned object.

.. code-block:: ruby

  regex = Regexp.from_bson(byte_buffer)
  regex.pattern #=> Returns the pattern as a string.
  regex.options #=> Returns the raw options as a String.
  regex.compile #=> Returns the compiled Ruby Regexp object.
