===================
db.repairDatabase()
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: db.repairDatabase()

   :method:`db.repairDatabase()` provides a wrapper around the database
   command :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, and has the same effect as
   the run-time option :option:`mongod --repair` option, limited to
   *only* the current database. See :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` for
   full documentation.

Behavior
--------

.. include:: /includes/warning-repair.rst

.. include:: /includes/note-repair.rst

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

   The :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command works on primary and secondary
   members of a replica set. Because writes to secondaries are not
   allowed, the command only compacts secondaries to reclaim disk space.
