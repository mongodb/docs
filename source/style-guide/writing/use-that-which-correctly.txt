============================================
Use *that*, *which*, and *such as* Correctly
============================================

A *restrictive* clause is essential to the meaning of a sentence
because it limits the noun to which it refers. If you omit a
restrictive clause, you change the meaning of the sentence. You can
indicate a restrictive clause with the relative pronoun *that* or
*who*, and you don't set off a restrictive clause with commas.

A *nonrestrictive* clause doesn't change the core meaning of the
sentence. You set off a nonrestrictive clause with commas and can use
the relative pronoun *which* or *who* in some cases.

   * - Restrictive clause
     - Nonrestrictive clause
   * - He hired the man **who came from Kansas**. (Not the man from
       Idaho)
     - Jackhammers, **which are useful for breaking up concrete**, are
       on sale.
   * - Enter the username and password **that you just created**. (Not
       the username and password that you created last month)
     - The hourly backups are rolled into a nightly backup, **which is
       retained for two days**.
   * - Foods such as pizza and ice cream aren’t very good for you.
     - Don't hyphenate words that begin with the prefix *multi*, such
       as *multitenant* and *multifaceted*, unless the root word starts
       with an *i* or a capital letter.

.. _restrictive-clauses:

Be sure to clarify restrictive clauses, as follows:

-  Include the relative pronoun (usually *that*). You can identify
   restrictive clauses in which *that* is missing by looking for two
   successive nouns.
-  Don't substitute *which* for *that*.
-  For the use of *such as*, use a comma before a nonrestrictive clause
   and don't use a comma for a restrictive clause. You can tell if the
   clause is nonrestrictive by taking the phrase starting with *such
   as* out of the sentence and see whether the sentence is still true.
   For example:

   In this forest, you'll see many types of coniferous trees, such as pine
   and spruce.

   In this forest, you'll see many types of coniferous trees.

   See *such as* in the :ref:`alphabetical-list-of-terms` for more examples.
