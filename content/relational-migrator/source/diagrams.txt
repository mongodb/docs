**Diagrams** in Relational Migrator are entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs). 
The term "entity" refers to either a table in the relational model
or a collection in the MongoDB model.
A project's :guilabel:`Mapping` screen maintains entity-relationship diagrams
that show tables, foreign key relationships, and data types. This helps you
optimize how you represent your relational data in MongoDB. Diagrams also
let you see how your mapping rules shape your MongoDB schema.

When you finish :ref:`creating a migration project
<rm-create-project-live>`, {+rel-mig+} creates a new diagram
based on your mapping rules. 

Each diagram has two views:

- The :guilabel:`Relational` view represents the tables in your relational
  database. This view updates if you change your project's data model.

- The :guilabel:`MongoDB` view represents the collections in your MongoDB
  database. This view updates if you :ref:`change your project's mapping rules <mapping-rules-edit>`.

You can also use `Hackolade <https://hackolade.com/>`__ to visualize your schemas.
