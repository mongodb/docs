Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use **collations** with MongoDB to order your
query or aggregation operation results by string values. A collation is a set
of character ordering and matching rules that apply to a specific language and
locale.

You can learn more about collations in the following sections in this guide:

- :ref:`Collations in MongoDB <collations-mongodb>`
- :ref:`How to Specify Collations <collations-specify>`
- :ref:`Collation Options <collations-options>`
- :ref:`Collation Code Examples <collations-examples>`

.. _collation-example-collection:

Sample Data for Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples on this page use a MongoDB collection with the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 1, "firstName" : "Klara" }
   { "_id" : 2, "firstName" : "Gunter" }
   { "_id" : 3, "firstName" : "Günter" }
   { "_id" : 4, "firstName" : "Jürgen" }
   { "_id" : 5, "firstName" : "Hannah" }

These documents are represented by the following data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CollationsTest.snippet.data-class-first-name.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. _collations-mongodb:

Collations in MongoDB
---------------------

MongoDB sorts strings using **binary collation** by default. The binary
collation uses the :wikipedia:`ASCII standard <ASCII>` character values to
compare and order strings. Certain languages and locales have specific
character ordering conventions that differ from the ASCII character values.

For example, in Canadian French, the right-most accented character
(diacritic) determines the ordering for strings when all preceding characters
are the same. Consider the following Canadian French words:

- cote
- coté
- côte
- côté

When using binary collation, MongoDB sorts them in the following order:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   cote
   coté
   côte
   côté

When using the Canadian French collation, MongoDB sorts them in a different
order as shown below:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   cote
   côte
   coté
   côté

.. _collations-specify:

How to Specify Collations
-------------------------

MongoDB supports collations on most :doc:`CRUD operations </fundamentals/crud>`
and aggregations. For a complete list of supported operations, see the
:manual:`Operations that Support Collations </reference/collation/#operations-that-support-collation>`
server manual page.

You can specify the locale code and optional variant in the following string
format:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   "<locale code>@collation=<variant code>"

The following example specifies the "de" locale code and "phonebook" variant
code:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   "de@collation=phonebook"

If you do not need to specify a variant, omit everything after the locale
code as follows:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   "de"

For a complete list of supported locales, see our server manual page on
:manual:`Supported Languages and Locales </reference/collation-locales-defaults/#supported-languages-and-locales>`.

The following sections show you different ways to apply collations in
MongoDB:

- :ref:`Collection <collations-collection>`
- :ref:`Index <collations-index>`
- :ref:`Operation <collations-operation>`

.. _collations-collection:

Collection
~~~~~~~~~~

You can set a default collation when you create a collection. When you
create a collection with a specified collation, all supported operations
that scan that collection apply the rules of the collation.

You can only assign a default collation to a collection when you create that
collection. However, you can specify a collation in a new index on an existing
collection. See the :ref:`Index <collations-index>` section of this guide
for more information.

The following snippet shows how to specify the "en_US" locale collation
when creating a new collection called ``items``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CollationsTest.snippet.create-collection-options.kt
   :language: kotlin

To check whether you created the collation successfully, retrieve a list
of the indexes on that collection as follows:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/CollationsTest.snippet.list-indexes.kt
      :language: kotlin
   
   .. output::
      :language: javascript

      {
        // ...
        "collation": {
           "locale": "en_US",
           // ...
        },
        // ...
      }

.. _collations-index:

Index
~~~~~

You can specify a collation when you create a new index on a collection.
The index stores an ordered representation of the documents in the
collection so your operation does not need to perform the ordering
in-memory. To use the index, your operation must meet the following
criteria:

- The operation uses the same collation as the one specified in the index.
- The operation is covered by the index that contains the collation.

The following code snippet shows how you can create an index on the "firstName"
field with the "en_US" locale collation in ascending order:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CollationsTest.snippet.create-collation-with-index.kt
   :language: kotlin

To check whether you created the collation successfully, retrieve a list
of the indexes on that collection as follows:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/CollationsTest.snippet.list-indexes.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: javascript

      {
        // ...
        "collation": {
           "locale": "en_US",
           // ...
        },
        // ...
      }

The following code snippet shows an example operation that specifies the
same collation and is covered by the index we created in the preceding code snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CollationsTest.snippet.collation-operation.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. _collations-operation:

Operation
~~~~~~~~~

You can override the default collation on a collection by passing the
new collation as a parameter to one of the supported operations. However,
since the operation does not use an index, the operation may not perform
as well as one that is covered by an index. For more information on the
disadvantages of sorting operations not covered by an index, see the server
manual page on :manual:`Use Indexes to Sort Query Results </tutorial/sort-results-with-indexes/>`.

The following code snippet shows an example query operation with the
following characteristics:

- The referenced collection contains the default collation "en_US" similar to
  the one specified in the :ref:`Collection <collations-collection>` section.
- The query specifies the Icelandic ("is") collation which is not covered
  by the collection's default collation index.
- Since the specified collation is not covered by an index, the sort
  operation is performed in-memory.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CollationsTest.snippet.collation-custom-operation.kt
   :language: kotlin

Index Types That Do Not Support Collations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While most MongoDB index types support collation, the following types support
only binary comparison:

- :manual:`text </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/#options-for-text-indexes>`
- :manual:`2d </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/#options-for-2dsphere-indexes>`
- :manual:`geoHaystack </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/#options-for-geohaystack-indexes>`

.. _collations-options:

Collation Options
-----------------

This section covers various collation options and how to specify them to
further refine the ordering and matching behavior.

You can use the ``Collation.Builder`` class to specify values for the
preceding collation options. You can call the ``build()`` method to construct a
``Collation`` object as shown in the following code snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CollationsTest.snippet.collation-builder.kt
   :language: kotlin

take, see the API Documentation for `Collation.Builder
<{+core-api+}/client/model/Collation.Builder.html>`__.

.. _collations-examples:

Collation Examples
------------------

This section contains examples that demonstrate how to use a selection of
MongoDB operations that support collations.

In the following examples, we specify the ``"de@collation=phonebook"`` locale and
variant collation. The "de" part of the collation specifies the German
locale and the "collation=phonebook" part specifies a variant. The
"de" locale collation contains rules for prioritizing proper nouns,
identified by capitalization of the first letter. In the
"collation=phonebook" variant, characters with umlauts are ordered before
the same characters without them in an ascending sort.

find() and sort() Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example demonstrates how you can apply a collation when
retrieving sorted results from a collection. To perform this
operation, call ``find()`` on the example collection and chain the
``collation()`` and ``sort()`` methods to specify the order in which you want
to receive the results.

When we perform this operation on our :ref:`example collection <collation-example-collection>`,
the output should resemble the following:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/CollationsTest.snippet.find-and-sort.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: console

      FirstName(id=3, firstName=Günter, verified=false)
      FirstName(id=2, firstName=Gunter, verified=false)
      FirstName(id=5, firstName=Hannah, verified=false)
      FirstName(id=4, firstName=Jürgen, verified=false)
      FirstName(id=1, firstName=Klara, verified=false)

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API Documentation:

- `find() <{+driver-api+}/-mongo-collection/find.html>`__
- `sort() <{+driver-api+}/-find-flow/sort.html>`__
- `Sorts <{+core-api+}/client/model/Sorts.html>`__

findOneAndUpdate() Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section demonstrates how you can specify a collation in an
operation that updates the first match from your query. To specify the
collation for this operation, instantiate a ``FindOneAndUpdateOptions``
object, set a collation on it, and pass it as a parameter to your call to
the ``findOneAndUpdate()`` method.

In this example, we demonstrate the following:

- Retrieve the first document in our :ref:`example collection <collation-example-collection>`
  that precedes "Gunter" in an ascending order.
- Set options for operation including the ``"de@collation=phonebook"``
  collation.
- Add a new field "verified" with the value "true".
- Retrieve and print the updated document.

.. note::

   The following code example uses imports from the
   ``import com.mongodb.client.model`` package for convenience.

Since "Günter" is lexically before "Gunter" using the
``de@collation=phonebook`` collation in ascending order, the following operation
returns "Günter" before "Gunter" in the results:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/CollationsTest.snippet.find-one-and-update.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: console

      FirstName(id=3, firstName=Günter, verified=true)

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API Documentation:

- `findOneAndUpdate <{+driver-api+}/-mongo-collection/find-one-and-update.html>`__
- `findOneAndUpdateOptions <{+core-api+}/client/model/FindOneAndUpdateOptions.html>`__
- `Filters <{+core-api+}/client/model/Filters.html>`__
- `Updates <{+core-api+}/client/model/Updates.html>`__
- `Sorts <{+core-api+}/client/model/Sorts.html>`__


findOneAndDelete() Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section demonstrates how you can specify a numerical ordering of
strings in a collation in an operation that deletes the first match from your
query. To specify the collation for this operation, instantiate
a ``FindOneAndDeleteOptions`` object, set a numeric ordering collation on
it, and pass it as a parameter to your call to the ``findOneAndDelete()``
method.

This example calls the ``findOneAndDelete()`` operation on a collection that
contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 1, "a" : "16 apples" }
   { "_id" : 2, "a" : "84 oranges" }
   { "_id" : 3, "a" : "179 bananas" }

These documents are represented by the following data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/CollationsTest.snippet.data-class-collation-example.kt
   :language: kotlin

In the collation, we set the ``locale`` option to "en" and the
``numericOrdering`` option to "true" in order to sort strings based on their
numerical order.

.. note::

   The following code example uses imports from the
   ``import com.mongodb.client.model`` package for convenience.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/CollationsTest.snippet.find-one-and-delete.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: console

      CollationExample(id=3, a=179 bananas)

The numeric value of the string "179" is greater than the number 100, so
the preceding document is the only match.

If we perform the same operation without the numerical ordering collation
on the original collection of three documents, the filter matches all of
our documents since "100" comes before "16", "84", and "179" when ordering
by binary collation.

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API Documentation:

- `findOneAndDelete <{+driver-api+}/-mongo-collection/find-one-and-delete.html>`__
- `FindOneAndDeleteOptions <{+core-api+}/client/model/FindOneAndDeleteOptions.html>`__
- `Filters <{+core-api+}/client/model/Filters.html>`__
- `Sorts <{+core-api+}/client/model/Sorts.html>`__

Aggregation Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section demonstrates how you can specify a collation in an aggregation
operation. In an aggregation operation, you can specify a series of
aggregation stages which is collectively called the aggregation pipeline. To
perform an aggregation, call the ``aggregate()`` method on a
``MongoCollection`` object.

To specify a collation for an aggregation operation, call the ``collation()``
method on the ``AggregateFlow`` returned by the aggregation operation.
Make sure to specify a sort aggregation stage on which to apply the
collation in your aggregation pipeline.

The following example shows how we can construct an aggregation pipeline on
the :ref:`example collection <collation-example-collection>` and apply
a collation by specifying the following:

- A group aggregation stage using the ``Aggregates.group()`` helper to
  identify each document by the ``firstName`` field and use that value as
  the ``_id`` of the result.
- An accumulator in the group aggregation stage to sum the number of
  instances of matching values in the ``firstName`` field.
- Apply an ascending sort to the ``_id`` field of the output documents of
  the prior aggregation stage.
- Construct a collation object, specifying the German locale and
  a collation strength that ignores accents and umlauts.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/CollationsTest.snippet.aggregates.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output::
      :language: console

      Result(id=Gunter, nameCount=2)
      Result(id=Hannah, nameCount=1)
      Result(id=Jürgen, nameCount=1)
      Result(id=Klara, nameCount=1)
