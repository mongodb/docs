Depending on whether you use a {+Flex-cluster+} or a {+dedicated-cluster+}, 
your bill may include different line items and information for you to consider. 

Understanding {+Flex-Clusters+} vs. {+Dedicated-Clusters+}
----------------------------------------------------------

{+Flex-Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+Flex-clusters+} are ideal for learning and exploring MongoDB inexpensively. 
{+Flex-cluster+} considerations include:

- Multiple {+clusters+} share hardware. The underlying 
  compute is on a large machine that hosts many {+Flex-clusters+}, which impacts 
  maximum performance and storage capacity.

- Despite the shared hardware, all data is secure and accessible 
  only by you.

- {+Flex-clusters+} do not have access to advanced features 
  such as query diagnosis tools and horizontal scaling, which makes them a good fit 
  for non-production use cases.

{+Dedicated-Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+Dedicated-clusters+} (M10 and higher) are designed for more robust workloads, offering greater 
control and guaranteed resources:

- Your {+cluster+}'s hardware is dedicated to your workload. 
  Dedicated hardware provides granularity in the control of hardware specifications 
  like RAM, vCPU, and storage.

- We guarantee the availability of the specified resources, 
  which ensures consistent performance.

- Backup settings are more robust in {+dedicated-clusters+}. 
  You can configure backup settings for {+dedicated-clusters+} with granularity 
  as low as one-second intervals.

- You have access to our premium diagnostic tools such as 
  :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` and `Query Insights <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cloud-manager/query-insights/>`__.

Billing Breakdown for Each Tier
-------------------------------

{+Flex-cluster+} Billing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Billing for {+Flex-clusters+} is straightforward and designed to keep costs low 
and predictable. {+Flex-clusters+} have a maximum charge of $30 per month.

For more information, refer to the :ref:`<atlas-flex-costs>` page.

{+Dedicated-Cluster+} Billing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Billing for {+dedicated-clusters+} is more complex, which reflects the enhanced 
capabilities and resources:

- Starts at $60 per month, which typically includes compute 
  and included storage costs.

- There may be usage fees for services such as backups 
  (depending on frequency and configuration), storage beyond the default :ref:`cluster 
  tier <create-cluster-instance>` threshold, and data transfers.

- The selected tier impacts the structure of your invoice, 
  with various line items reflecting different aspects of your {+cluster+}'s usage.

Investigating Your Invoice
--------------------------

Key Areas to Monitor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there are unexpected charges on your invoice, monitor the following areas:

- **Cloud computing costs.** These are often the most significant portion 
  of the bill. You can review them by going to the :guilabel:`Billing` page in 
  |service|, and clicking :guilabel:`Summary By Service`. This view shows the 
  costs of all {+clusters+} by provider, tier, and region. If you find any 
  {+clusters+} that are no longer needed, pause or terminate them to avoid 
  unnecessary costs.

- **Storage limits.** Each {+cluster+} tier comes with a specific storage limit. 
  To manage storage costs, enable the :ref:`auto-scaling feature <cluster-autoscaling>`, 
  which adjusts storage capacity based on usage and the thresholds you set. 
  For example, if youâ€™re using less than 50% of your allocated storage, 
  the system will scale down your storage capacity automatically.

- **Backups.** Backups are crucial for production workloads but can also be a 
  significant cost driver. For non-critical {+clusters+}, consider reducing the 
  backup frequency or disabling continuous cloud backups to reduce costs.
   
- **Data transfer costs.** Data transfer costs vary depending on where the data is 
  being transferred. Transfers within the same region are the least expensive, 
  followed by transfers between different regions. Internet transfers are the 
  most costly.
