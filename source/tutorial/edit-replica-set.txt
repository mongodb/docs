Overview
--------

You can add, remove, and reconfigure members in a :term:`replica set`
directly in the |mms| console.

Procedures
----------

.. _add-member-to-rs:

Add a Replica Set Member
++++++++++++++++++++++++

You must have an existing server to which to deploy the new replica set
member. To add a member to an existing
replica set, increasing the size of the set:

.. include:: /includes/steps/add-replica-set-member.rst

.. important::
   To avoid disrupting disrupting majority writes, new members are now added to
   :term:`replica sets <replica set>` as ``priority=0``, ``votes=0`` until they
   reach secondary state, after which |mms| automatically updates the
   configuration to match the :manual:`priority
   </reference/replica-configuration/#rsconf.members[n].priority>` and
   :manual:`votes </reference/replica-configuration/#rsconf.members[n].votes>`
   value specified in the deployment.

Edit a Replica Set Member
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use this procedure to:

- Reconfigure a member as :manual:`hidden </core/replica-set-hidden-member>`

- Reconfigure a member as :manual:`delayed </core/replica-set-delayed-member>`

- Reset a member's :manual:`priority level in elections </core/replica-set-elections>`

- Change a member's votes.

To reconfigure a member as an :manual:`arbiter </core/replica-set-arbiter>`,
see :ref:`replace-member-with-arbiter`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/edit-replica-set-member.rst

.. _replace-member-with-arbiter:

Replace a Member with an Arbiter
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You cannot directly reconfigure a member as an arbiter. Instead, you must must
add a new member to the replica set as an arbiter. Then you must shut down an
existing secondary.

.. include:: /includes/steps/replace-member-with-arbiter.rst

Remove a Replica Set Member
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Removing a member from a replica set does not shut down the member or remove
it from |mms|. |mms| still monitors the :program:`mongod` as as standalone
instance.

When removing members, you must keep a majority of voting members active with
respect to the original number of voting members. Otherwise your primary will
step down and your replica set become read-only. You can remove multiple
members at once **only if doing so leaves a majority**. For more information
on voting, see :manual:`Replica Set Elections </core/replica-set-elections>`
and :manual:`Replica Set High Availability
</core/replica-set-high-availability>` in the MongoDB Manual.

Removing members might affect the ability of the replica set to acknowledge
writes, depending on the level of :term:`write concern` you use. For more
information, see :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern>` in the
MongoDB manual.

To remove a member:

.. include:: /includes/steps/remove-replica-set-member.rst
