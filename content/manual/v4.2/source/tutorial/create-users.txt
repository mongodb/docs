Overview

.. include:: /includes/intro-rbac.rst

.. _add-user-prereq:

Prerequisites
-------------

If you have enabled access control for your deployment, you can use
the :ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>` to create the first
user in the system. This first user must have privileges to create
other users. As of MongoDB 3.0, with the localhost exception, you
can only create users on the ``admin`` database. Once you create the
first user, you must authenticate as that user to add subsequent users.
:doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication` provides more detail about
adding users when enabling access control for a deployment.

For routine user creation, you must possess the following permissions:

.. include:: /includes/access-create-user.rst

.. _add-new-user:

Examples
--------

To create a user in a MongoDB deployment, you connect to the
deployment, and then use the :method:`db.createUser()` method
or :dbcommand:`createUser` command to add the user.

Username/Password Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation creates a user in the ``reporting``
database with the specified name, password, and roles.

.. tip::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-passwordPrompt.rst

.. code-block:: javascript

   use reporting
   db.createUser(
     {
       user: "reportsUser",
       pwd: passwordPrompt(),  // or cleartext password
       roles: [
          { role: "read", db: "reporting" },
          { role: "read", db: "products" },
          { role: "read", db: "sales" },
          { role: "readWrite", db: "accounts" }
       ]
     }
   )

:doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication` provides more details about
enforcing authentication for your MongoDB deployment.

Kerberos Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/create-user-intro-kerberos.rst

For Kerberos authentication, you must add the Kerberos principal
as the username. You do not need to specify a password.

The following operation adds the Kerberos principal ``reportingapp@EXAMPLE.NET``
with read-only access to the ``records`` database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use $external
   db.createUser(
       {
         user: "reportingapp@EXAMPLE.NET",
         roles: [
            { role: "read", db: "records" }
         ]
       }
   )

:doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication`
and :doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-windows-with-kerberos-authentication`
provide more details about setting up Kerberos authentication for your
MongoDB deployment.

LDAP Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/create-user-intro-ldap.rst

For LDAP authentication, you must specify a username. You do not need
to specify the password, as that is handled by the LDAP service.

The following operation adds the ``reporting`` user
with read-only access to the ``records`` database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use $external
   db.createUser(
       {
         user: "reporting",
         roles: [
            { role: "read", db: "records" }
         ]
       }
   )

:doc:`/tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-activedirectory` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-openldap` provide more detail about
using authenticating using LDAP.

x.509 Client Certificate Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/create-user-intro-x509.rst

For x.509 Client Certificate authentication, you must add the value of
the ``subject`` from the client certificate as a MongoDB user. Each
unique x.509 client certificate corresponds to a single MongoDB user.
You do not need to specify a password.

The following operation adds the client certificate subject
``CN=myName,OU=myOrgUnit,O=myOrg,L=myLocality,ST=myState,C=myCountry``
user with read-only access to the ``records`` database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use $external
   db.createUser(
       {
         user: "CN=myName,OU=myOrgUnit,O=myOrg,L=myLocality,ST=myState,C=myCountry",
         roles: [
            { role: "read", db: "records" }
         ]
       }
   )

:doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication` provides details
about setting up x.509 Client Certificate authentication for your
MongoDB deployment.
