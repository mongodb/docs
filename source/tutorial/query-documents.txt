Select All Documents in a Collection
------------------------------------

To select all documents in the collection, pass an empty document
``{}`` as the query filter parameter to the find method. The query
filter parameter determines the select criteria:

.. include:: /includes/driver-example-query-7.rst

These operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT * FROM inventory

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: shell
       content: |
         For more information on the syntax of the method, see
         :method:`~db.collection.find()`.
     - id: python
       content: |
         For more information on the syntax of the method, see
         :py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find`.

Specify Equality Condition
--------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/filter-equality.rst

The following example selects from the ``inventory`` collection all
documents where the ``status`` equals ``"D"``:

.. include:: /includes/driver-example-query-9.rst

This operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE status = "D"

Specify Conditions Using Query Operators
----------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/filter-query-operators.rst

The following example retrieves all documents from the ``inventory``
collection where ``status`` equals either ``"A"`` or ``"D"``:

.. include:: /includes/driver-example-query-10.rst

Although you can express this query using the :query:`$or` operator,
use the :query:`$in` operator rather than the :query:`$or`
operator when performing equality checks on the same field.

The operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE status in ("A", "D")

Refer to the :doc:`/reference/operator/query` document for the complete
list of MongoDB query operators.

Specify ``AND`` Conditions
--------------------------

A compound query can specify conditions for more than one field in the
collection's documents. Implicitly, a logical ``AND`` conjunction
connects the clauses of a compound query so that the query selects the
documents in the collection that match all the conditions.

The following example retrieves all documents in the ``inventory``
collection where the ``status`` equals ``"A"`` **and** ``qty`` is less
than (:query:`$lt`) ``30``:

.. include:: /includes/driver-example-query-11.rst

The operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE status = "A" AND qty < 30

See :ref:`comparison operators <query-selectors-comparison>` for other
MongoDB comparison operators.

Specify ``OR`` Conditions
--------------------------

Using the :query:`$or` operator, you can specify a compound query
that joins each clause with a logical ``OR`` conjunction so that the
query selects the documents in the collection that match at least one
condition.

The following example retrieves all documents in the collection where
the ``status`` equals ``"A"`` **or** ``qty`` is less than
(:query:`$lt`) ``30``:

.. include:: /includes/driver-example-query-12.rst

The operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE status = "A" OR qty < 30

.. note::
   Queries which use :ref:`comparison operators <query-selectors-comparison>`
   are subject to :ref:`type-bracketing`.

Specify ``AND`` as well as ``OR`` Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following example, the compound query document selects all
documents in the collection where the ``status`` equals ``"A"``
**and** *either* ``qty`` is less than (:query:`$lt`) ``30`` *or*
``item`` starts with the character ``p``:

.. include:: /includes/driver-example-query-13.rst

The operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE status = "A" AND ( qty < 30 OR item LIKE "p%")

.. note::

   MongoDB supports regular expressions :query:`$regex` queries to
   perform string pattern matches.

Additional Query Tutorials
--------------------------

For additional query examples, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/query-embedded-documents`

- :doc:`/tutorial/query-arrays`

- :doc:`/tutorial/query-for-null-fields`

Behavior
--------

Cursor
~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: shell
       content: |
         The :method:`db.collection.find()` method
         returns a :doc:`cursor </tutorial/iterate-a-cursor>` to the matching
         documents.
     - id: python
       content: |
         The :py:meth:`pymongo.collection.Collection.find` method
         returns a :doc:`cursor </tutorial/iterate-a-cursor>` to the
         matching documents. See the PyMongo documentation for
         `iterating over a cursor <http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/tutorial.html#querying-for-more-than-one-document>`_.

Read Isolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.2

For reads to :doc:`replica sets </replication>` and replica set
:doc:`shards </sharding>`, read concern allows clients to choose a
level of isolation for their reads. For more information, see
:doc:`/reference/read-concern`.

Additional Methods
------------------

The following methods can also read documents from a collection:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: shell
       content: |
         - :method:`db.collection.findOne`

         - In :doc:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>`, the
           :pipeline:`$match` pipeline stage provides access to MongoDB
           queries.

         .. note::
            The :method:`db.collection.findOne()` method also performs a read
            operation to return a single document. Internally, the
            :method:`db.collection.findOne()` method is the
            :method:`db.collection.find()` method with a limit of 1.

     - id: python
       content: |
         - :py:meth:`pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one`
         
         - In :doc:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>`, the
           :pipeline:`$match` pipeline stage provides access to MongoDB
           queries. See the `PyMongo Aggregation Examples <https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/examples/aggregation.html#aggregate-examples>`_.
         
         .. note::
            The :py:meth:`pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one`
            method also performs a read operation to return a single
            document. Internally, the
            :py:meth:`pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one` method is
            the :py:meth:`pymongo.collection.Collection.find` method
            with a limit of 1.
