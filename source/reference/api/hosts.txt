     - boolean

       are: ``MONGODB_CR GSSAPI NONE``
   * - username
     - string
     - Username for connecting to this host. Only present when the
       ``authMechanismName`` is ``MONGODB_CR``.
   * - password
     - string
     - Password for connecting to this host. If a host's ``authMechanismName``
       is ``MONGODB_CR``, then you must include this field when creating the
       host or updating its credentials. However, it will never be exposed when
       a host entity is returned.
   * - aliases
     - array of strings
     - A list of alternate hostname:port combinations that |mms| has discovered for
       the host.

About Host Aliases
------------------

You can typically access a host using a variety of names. DNS records
and entries in the ``/etc/hosts`` file determine what names you can use to
access a given host.

When you add a host to |mms|, |mms| automatically discovers various valid
hostname and port combinations for each monitored ``mongod`` and
``mongos`` process. |mms| then ranks the hostnames to choose a "primary"
hostname. Hostnames with the most periods are ranked highest, while the
loopback address (``127.0.0.1``) and ``localhost`` lowest. |mms|
treats the "losing" hostnames as host aliases.

When |mms| processes a ping from the Monitoring agent, the algorithm for
assigning a primary hostname repeats. As a result, the primary hostname
may change over time. You can also :ref:`specify preferred hostnames
<group-settings-page>` in |mms|'s group settings to override the hostname
algorithm.

   * - Relation
     - Description
   * - self
     - Me
   * - cluster
     - The cluster this host belongs to. Only present if the host is part of a
       replica set or master/slave.

   * - group
     - The group that this host belongs to.

Operations
----------

- ``GET /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/hosts`` - Get all hosts in a group. Use
  the ``clusterId`` query parameter to only get the hosts that belong to the
  specified cluster. The resulting list is sorted alphabetically by
  ``hostname:port``.

- ``GET /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/hosts/HOST-ID`` - Get a single host by
  ID.

- ``GET /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/hosts/byName/HOSTNAME:PORT`` - Get a
  single host by its hostname and port combination. You can specify either the
  primary hostname or an alias.

.. only:: classic
  
   - ``POST /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/hosts`` - Create a new host in the
     group. Note that after a new host is created, |mms| will not know much about
     it except what is provided. Thus, the document returned in the response will
     be missing many values until they are discovered, which could take several
     minutes. Only these fields may be specified when creating a host:

     - ``hostname`` - Required.

     - ``port`` - Required.

     - ``username`` - Required if ``authMechanismName`` is
       ``MONGODB_CR``.Otherwise it's illegal.

     - ``password`` - Required if ``authMechanismName`` is
       ``MONGODB_CR``. Otherwise it's illegal.

     - ``sslEnabled`` - Default is ``false`` if omitted.

     - ``logsEnabled`` - Default is ``false`` if omitted.

     - ``alertsEnabled`` - Default is ``true`` if omitted.

     - ``profilerEnabled`` - Default is ``false`` if omitted.

     - ``muninPort`` - Default is 0 and Munin stats are not collected if omitted.

     - ``authMechanismName`` - Default is ``NONE`` if omitted. If set to
       ``MONGODB_CR`` then you must provide the ``username`` and ``password``.

   - ``PATCH /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/hosts/HOST-ID`` - Update an existing
     host using the fields provided. Unspecified fields will preserve their current
     values.

     - Only these fields may be specified: ``username password sslEnabled
       logsEnabled alertsEnabled profilerEnabled muninPort authMechanismName``

     - If ``authMechanismName`` is ``NONE`` then any existing value for
       ``username`` and ``password`` will be cleared out. For ``MONGODB_CR`` you
       must provide both ``username`` and ``password``.

   - ``DELETE /api/public/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/hosts/HOST-ID`` - Remove a host.
