Starting in MongoDB 8.0, rejected query plans only contain the ``find``
portion of the query. In previous versions, rejected plans can contain
aggregation stages like :pipeline:`$group`. Those aggregation stages
aren't used by the query planner to choose the winning plan, so the
``rejectedPlans`` field only contains the portion of the query that was
used to choose the winning plan.
