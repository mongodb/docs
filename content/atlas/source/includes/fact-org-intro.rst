In the organizations and projects hierarchy, an organization can
contain multiple projects (previously referred to as groups). Under
this structure:

.. include:: /includes/list-organization-hierarchy.rst

If you need to scale beyond the existing 
:ref:`project limits <org-project-limits>`, you can 
:ref:`create multiple organizations <create-mult-orgs>`.
