Replica Set Configuration
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

This reference provides an overview of all possible replica set
configuration options and settings.

Use :func:`rs.conf()` in the :program:`mongo` shell to retrieve this
configuration. Note that default values are not explicitly displayed.

.. _replica-set-configuration-variables:

Configuration Variables
-----------------------

.. data:: rs.conf._id:

   **Type**: string

   **Value**: <setname>

   An ``_id`` field holding the name of the replica set. This reflects
   the set name configured with :setting:`replSet` or
   :option:`mongod --replSet`.

.. data:: rs.conf.members

   **Type**: array

   Contains an array holding an embeded :term:`document` for each
   member of the replica set. The ``members`` document contains a
   number of fields that describe the configuration of each member of
   the replica set.

.. data:: members[n]._id

   **Type**: ordinal

   Provides a zero-indexed identifier of every member in the replica
   set.

.. data:: members[n].host

   **Type**: <hostname>:<port>

   Identifies the host name of the set member with a hostname and port
   number. This name must be resolvable for every host in the replica
   set.

   .. warning::

      :data:`members[n].host` cannot hold a value that resolves to
      ``localhost`` or the local interface unless *all* members of the
      set are on hosts that resolve to localhost.

.. data:: members[n].arbiterOnly

   *Optional*.

   **Type**: boolean

   **Default**: false

   Identifies an arbiter. For arbiters, this value is ``true``, and
   is automatically configured by :func:`rs.addArb()`".

.. data:: members[n].buildIndexes

   *Optional*.

   **Type**: boolean

   **Default**: true

   Determines whether the :program:`mongod` builds :term:`indexes
   <index>` on this member. Do not set to ``false`` if a replica set
   *can* become a master, or if any clients ever issue queries against
   this instance.

   Omitting index creation, and thus this setting, may be useful,
   **if**:

   - You are only using this instance to perform backups using
     :program:`mongodump`,

   - this instance will receive no queries will, *and*

   - index creation and maintenance overburdens the host
     system.

.. data:: members[n].hidden

   *Optional*.

   **Type**: boolean

   **Default**: false

   When this value is ``true``, the replica set hides this instance,
   and does not include the member in the output of
   :func:`db.isMaster()` or :dbcommand:`isMaster`. This
   prevents read operations (i.e. queries) from ever reaching this
   host by way of secondary :term:`read preference`.

   .. seealso:: ":ref:`Hidden Replica Set Members <replica-set-hidden-members>`"

.. data:: members[n].priority

   *Optional*.

   **Type**: Number, between 0 and 1000 including decimals.

   **Default**: 1

   Specify higher values to make a node *more* eligible to become
   :term:`primary`, and lower values to make the node *less* eligible
   to become primary. Priorities are only used in comparison to each
   other, members of the set will veto elections from nodes when
   another eligible node has a higher absolute priority value.

   A :data:`members[n].priority` of ``0`` makes it impossible for a
   node to become primary.

   .. seealso:: ":ref:`Replica Set Node Priority
      <replica-set-node-priority>`" and ":ref:`Replica Set Elections
      <replica-set-elections>`."

.. data:: members[n].tags

   *Optional*.

   **Type**: :term:`MongoDB Document <document>`

   **Default**: none

   Used to represent arbitrary values for describing or tagging nodes
   for the purposes of extending :ref:`write concern
   <replica-set-write-concern>` to allow configurable data center
   awareness.

   Use in conjunction with :data:`settings.getLastErrorModes` and
   :data:`settings.getLastErrorDefaults` and
   :func:`db.getLastError()`
   (i.e. :dbcommand:`getLastError`.)

.. data:: members[n].slaveDelay

   *Optional*.

   **Type**: Integer. (seconds.)

   **Default**: 0

   Describes the number of seconds "behind" the master that this
   replica set member should "lag." Use this option to create
   :ref:`delayed nodes <replica-set-delayed-members>`, that
   maintain a copy of the data that reflects the state of the data set
   some amount of time (specified in seconds.) Typically these nodes
   help protect against human error, and provide some measure
   of insurance against the unforeseen consequences of changes and
   updates.

.. data:: members[n].votes

   *Optional*.

   **Type**: Integer

   **Default**: 1

   Controls the number of votes a server has in a :ref:`replica set
   election <replica-set-elections>`. The number of votes each member
   has can be any non-negative integer, but it is highly recommended
   each member has 1 or 0 votes.

   If you need more than 7 members, use this setting to add additional
   non-voting members with a :data:`members[n].votes` value of ``0``.

   For most deployments and most members, use the default value,
   ``1``, for :data:`members[n].votes`.

.. data:: settings

   *Optional*.

   **Type**: :term:`MongoDB Document <document>`

   The setting document holds two optional fields, which affect the
   available :term:`write concern` options and default configurations.

.. data:: settings.getLastErrorDefaults

   *Optional*.

   **Type**: :term:`MongoDB Document <document>`

   Specify arguments to the :dbcommand:`getLastError` that
   members of this replica set will use when no arguments to
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` has no arguments. If you specify *any*
   arguments, :dbcommand:`getLastError` , ignores these defaults.

.. data:: settings.getLastErrorModes

   *Optional*.

   **Type**: :term:`MongoDB Document <document>`

   Defines the names and combination of :data:`tags
   <members[n].tags>` for use by the application layer to guarantee
   :term:`write concern` to database using the
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` command to provide :term:`data-center
   awareness`.

.. _replica-set-configuration-document:

Example Document
----------------

The following document is a prototypical representation a MongoDB
replica set configuration document. Square brackets (e.g. ``[`` and
``]``) enclose all optional fields.


.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id : <setname>,
     members: [
       {
         _id : <ordinal>,
         host : <hostname[:port]>
         [, arbiterOnly : true]
         [, buildIndexes : <bool>]
         [, hidden : true]
         [, priority: <priority>]
         [, tags: {loc1 : desc1, loc2 : desc2, ..., locN : descN}]
         [, slaveDelay : <n>]
         [, votes : <n>]
       }
       , ...
     ],
     [settings: {
       [getLastErrorDefaults: <lasterrdefaults>]
       [, getLastErrorModes : <modes>]
     }]
   }

.. _replica-set-reconfiguration-usage:

Usage
-----

Most modifications of replica set configuration use the
:program:`mongo` shell. Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0.5
   cfg.members[1].priority = 2
   cfg.members[2].priority = 2
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

This operation begins by saving the current replica set configuration
to the local variable ``cfg`` using the :func:`rs.conf()`
method. Then it adds priority values to the :term:`document`
where the :data:`members[n]._id` field has a value of ``0``, ``1``, or
``2``. Finally, it calls the :func:`rs.reconfig()` method with the
argument of ``cfg`` to initialize this new configuration.

Using this "dot notation," you can modify any existing setting or
specify any of optional :ref:`replica set configuration variables
<replica-set-configuration-variables>`. Until you run
``rs.reconfig(cfg)`` at the shell, no changes will take effect. You
can issue ``cfg = rs.conf()`` at any time before using
:func:`rs.reconfig()` to undo your changes and start from the
current configuration. If you issue ``cfg`` as an operation at any
point, the :program:`mongo` shell at any point will output the complete
:term:`document` with modifications for your review.

The :func:`rs.reconfig()` operation has a "force" option, to make it
possible to reconfigure a replica set if a majority of the replica set
is not visible, and there is no :term:`primary` member of the set.
use the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.reconfig(cfg, { force: true } )

.. warning::

   Forcing a :func:`rs.reconfig()` can lead to :term:`rollback`
   situations and other difficult to recover from situations. Exercise
   caution when using this option.

.. note::

   The :func:`rs.reconfig()` shell command can force the current
   primary to step down and causes an election in some
   situations. When the primary node steps down, all clients will
   disconnect. This is by design. While this typically takes 10-20
   seconds, attempt to make these changes during scheduled maintenance
   periods.
