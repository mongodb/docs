Atlas Device Sync :ref:`optimizes sync storage <optimize-sync-atlas-usage>` by
minimizing the amount of Device Sync metadata stored in your Atlas clusters.
However, these strategies do *not* reduce the overall size of the Atlas cluster.

To reclaim disk space in your cluster, you must compact the data on an Atlas
volume. For more information on reducing the size of your Atlas cluster, contact :atlas:`Support </support>`.

You can compact your Atlas volume in two ways:

- (Recommended) File a Support ticket to request a rolling resync be performed
  on your Atlas cluster. This process is similar to the procedure outlined in
  :manual:`Resync a Member of a Replica Set <tutorial/>`, but re-syncing an
  Atlas cluster must be completed by a Support representative.

- Alternatively, you can compact the indexes on your Atlas cluster using the
  :manual:`compact() </reference/command/compact/>` command. This may not
  reduce the volume size as effectively as performing a rolling resync.

  This method involves performing a failover on the cluster's primary node. To
  fully understand this process and to ensure that your cluster meets the
  minimum requirements to successfully handle a primary failover, we highly
  recommend that you first perform a
  :atlas:`primary failover test </tutorial/test-resilience/test-primary-failover/>`.

  After successfully testing failover of your primary node, follow these steps:

  1. Run the :manual:`compact() </reference/command/compact/>` command on
     each of the cluster's secondary nodes, one at a time.

  #. Perform a failover on the primary mode, then run ``compact()`` on the
     primary node.
