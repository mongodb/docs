A {+fts+} index is a data structure that maps documents from your
Atlas cluster to the terms that are extracted from those documents.
{+fts+} indexes enable efficient full-text searches of your
database with {+fts+} queries. 

This page describes how to create, view, update, or delete {+fts+}
indexes using the {+atlas-ui+} or one of our supported clients.
