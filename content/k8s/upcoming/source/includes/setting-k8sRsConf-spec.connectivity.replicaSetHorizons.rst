.. setting:: spec.connectivity.replicaSetHorizons

   *Type*: collection

   Allows you to provide different |dns| settings for client
   applications and the {+mdbagent+}s. The |k8s-op-short| uses split
   horizon |dns| for replica set members. This feature allows
   communication both within the |k8s| cluster and from outside |k8s|.
   
   You may add multiple external mappings per host.
   
   Split Horizon Requirements:
   
   - Make sure that each value in this array is unique.
   
   - Make sure that the number of entries in this array matches the
     value given in :setting:`spec.members`.
   
   - Provide a value for the
     :setting:`spec.security.certsSecretPrefix` setting to
     enable |tls|. This method to use split horizons requires the
     Server Name Indication extension of the |tls| protocol.
   
   - :ref:`Configure the routing for external hostnames <connect-from-outside-k8s>`.
   
   .. example::
   
      In this example, the replica set members communicate amongst
      themselves on the ``example-localhost`` horizon. Clients
      communicate with the replica set using the ``example-website``
      horizon.

      The names of the stated horizons are arbitrary for the purposes of this 
      example. You can name your horizon anything, but make sure the horizon
      name is the same for all hostnames that are a part of that horizon.
