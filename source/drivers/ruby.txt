This is an overview of the available tools and suggested practices for
using Ruby with MongoDB. To skip to more detailed
discussion see:

Ruby Driver
-----------

.. important:: Install the ``bson_ext`` gem for any performance-critical applications.

The MongoDB Ruby driver is the officially supported Ruby driver for
MongoDB. It's written in pure Ruby, with a recommended C extension for
speed. The driver is optimized for simplicity. It can be used on its
own, but it also serves as the basis of several object mapping
libraries, such as `MongoMapper <http://mongomapper.com/>`_.

Resources:

- `Ruby Tutorial <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/wiki/Tutorial>`_

- `Documentation <http://api.mongodb.org/ruby/current/index.html>`_

- `Source Code <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver>`_

Install / Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Ruby driver is hosted at `Rubygems.org <http://rubygems.org/>`_.
Before installing the driver, make sure you're using the latest version
of rubygems:

.. code-block:: sh

   gem update --system

Then install the gems:

.. code-block:: sh

   gem install mongo

To stay on the bleeding edge, you can use the latest source from GitHub.
Using your Gemfile:

.. code-block:: sh

   gem 'mongo', :git => 'git://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver.git'

Or Manually:

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone git://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver.git
   cd mongo-ruby-driver/
   gem build bson.gemspec; gem install bson-x.x.x.gem
   gem build bson_ext.gemspec; gem install bson_ext-x.x.x.gem
   gem build mongo.gemspec; gem install mongo-x.x.x.gem

BSON
~~~~

In versions of the Ruby driver prior to 0.20, the code for serializing
to BSON existed in the ``mongo`` gem. Now, all BSON serialization is handled
by the required ``bson`` gem.

.. code-block:: sh

   gem install bson

For significantly improved performance, install the `bson_ext <http://rubygems.org/gems/bson_ext>`_
gem. Using compiled C instead of Ruby, this gem speeds up BSON
serialization greatly.

.. code-block:: sh

   gem install bson_ext

If you are running on Windows, you need the
`Ruby DevKit <https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/development-kit>`_
installed in order to compile the C extensions.

As long it is in Ruby's load path, ``bson_ext`` will be loaded automatically
when you require ``bson``.

.. note:: Beginning with version 0.20, the ``mongo_ext`` gem is no
   longer used.

To learn more about the Ruby driver, see the
`Ruby Tutorial <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver/wiki/Tutorial>`_ and
`Ruby Documentation <http://api.mongodb.org/ruby/current/index.html>`_.

Object Mappers
--------------

Because MongoDB is so easy to use, the basic Ruby driver can be the best
solution for many applications.

But if you need validations, associations, and other high-level data
modeling functions then an Object Document Mapper may be needed.

In the context of a Rails application these provide functionality
equivalent to, but distinct from, ActiveRecord. Because MongoDB is a
document-based database, these mappers are called Object Document
Mappers (ODM) as opposed to Object Relational Mappers (ORM).

Several mappers are available:

- `MongoMapper <http://mongomapper.com/>`_ from John Nunemaker

- `Mongoid <http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/index.html>`_ from Durran Jordan

- `Mongomatic <http://mongomatic.com/>`_ from Ben Myles

- `MongoODM <https://github.com/carlosparamio/mongo_odm>`_ from Carlos Paramio

- `MongoModel <http://www.mongomodel.org/>`_ from Sam Pohlenz

- `DriverAPILayer <http://alexeypetrushin.github.com/mongodb/driver.html>`_ from Alexey Petrushin

All the mappers build on top of the basic Ruby driver and so some
knowledge of that is useful, especially if you work with a custom
MongoDB configuration.
