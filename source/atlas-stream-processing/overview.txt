{+atlas-sp+} enables you to process streams of complex data using the
same :manual:`</query-api>` used in {+service+} databases. {+atlas-sp+}
allows you to:

- Build :ref:`aggregation pipelines <stream-aggregation>` to 
  continuously operate on streaming data without the delays inherent in 
  batch processing.
- Perform continuous :ref:`schema validation
  <streams-agg-pipeline-validate>` to check that messages are properly
  formed, detect message corruption, and detect late-arriving data.
- Continuously publish results to 
  {+service+} collections or {+kafka+} clusters, ensuring up-to-date 
  views and analysis of data.

{+atlas-sp+} components belong directly to |service| projects and
operate independent of |service| {+clusters+}.

Streaming Data
--------------

A stream is a continuous flow of data originating from one or more
sources, taking the form of an append-only log. Examples of data
streams include temperature or pressure readings from sensors, records
of financial transactions, or change data capture events.

Data streams originate from **sources** such as {+kafka-topics+} or 
:manual:`change streams </changeStreams/>`. You can then write processed
data to **sinks** such as {+kafka-topics+} or |service| collections.

Streams of data originate in systems with rapidly changing state. 
{+atlas-sp+} provides native stream processing capabilities to operate
on continuous data without the time and computational constraints of an
at-rest database.

{+atlas-sp+} Architecture
-------------------------------------------------

The core abstraction of {+atlas-sp+} is the stream processor. A stream
processor is a MongoDB :manual:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>` query that operates continuously on
streaming data from a specified source and writes the output to a
sink. To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-sp-processor-detailed`.

Stream processing takes place on {+spi+}s. Each {+spi+} is an
|service| namespace that associates the following:

- One or more **workers**, which provide the RAM and CPUs necessary
  to run your stream processors.
- A cloud provider and cloud region. 
- A **connection registry**, which stores the list of available
  sources and sinks of streaming data.
- A security context in which to define user authorizations.
- A :manual:`Connection String </reference/connection-string>` to
  the {+spi+} itself.

When you define a stream processor, it becomes available only for the
{+spi+} in which you define it. Each worker can host up to four
running stream processors; {+atlas-sp+} automatically scales your
{+spi+} up as you start stream processors by provisioning workers
as needed. You can deprovision a worker by stopping all stream
processors on it. {+atlas-sp+} always prefers to assign a stream
processor to an existing worker over provisioning new workers.

.. example::

   You have a {+spi+} running eight stream processors, named
   ``proc01`` through ``proc08``. ``proc01`` through ``proc04`` run on
   one worker, ``proc05`` through ``proc08`` run on a second
   worker. You start a new stream processor named
   ``proc09``. {+atlas-sp+} provisions a third worker to host
   ``proc09``.

   Later, you stop ``proc03`` on the first worker. When you stop
   ``proc09`` and restart it, {+atlas-sp+} reassigns ``proc09`` to the
   first worker and deprovisions the third worker.

   If you start a new stream processor named ``proc10`` before you stop
   and restart ``proc09``, {+atlas-sp+} assigns ``proc10`` to the first
   worker in the slot previously allocated to ``proc03``.

When scaling, {+atlas-sp+} only considers the number of currently
running stream processors; it doesn't count defined stream processors
that aren't running. The tier of the {+spi+} determines the RAM and
CPU allotment of its workers.

Connection registries store one or more connections. Each connection
assigns a name to the combination of networking and security details
that allow a stream processor to interact with external
services. Connections exhibit the following behavior:

- Only a connection defined in a given {+spi+}'s connection registry
  can service stream processors hosted on that {+spi+}.
- Each connection can service an arbitrary number of stream processors
- Only a single connection can serve as a given stream processor's source.
- Only a single connection can serve as a given stream processor's sink.
- A connection is not innately defined as either a source or a sink. Any given
  connection can serve either function depending on how a stream processor
  invokes that connection.

Structure of a Stream Processor
-------------------------------

Stream processors take the form of an aggregation pipeline. Each
processor begins with a :pipeline:`$source` stage which connects to a
source and begins receiving a continuous stream of data in the form of
documents. Each aggregation stage after the ``$source`` consumes each
record from the stream in turn, and can be grouped into three types:

- **Validation** : The :pipeline:`$validate` stage allows you to
  perform schema validation on ingested documents to ensure that only
  correctly formatted documents continue on to further processing and
  determine what happens to incorrectly formatted documents.
  Validation is optional.
- **Stateless Operations** : Aggregation stages or operators which
  can act directly on the incoming data stream. These aggregations
  consume, transform, and pass along each document in turn, and can
  appear at any point between the ``$source`` and either
  :ref:`$emit <streams-agg-pipeline-emit>` or
  :ref:`$merge <streams-agg-pipeline-merge>` stages.
- **Stateful Operations** : Aggregation stages or operators which can
  act only on bounded sets of documents. These aggregations consume,
  transform, and pass along entire sets of documents at once, and can
  appear only inside :ref:`windows <atlas-sp-windows>`.

Windows are pipeline stages that consume streaming data and partition
it into time-delimited sets so that you can apply stages and operators
inapplicable to infinite data such as :pipeline:`$group` and
:manual:`$avg </reference/operator/aggregation/avg>`. Each stream processor
can only have one window stage.

After processing the ingested data, the stream processor writes it to
either a streaming data platform using the ``$emit`` stage, or to an
|service| database with the ``$merge`` stage. These stages are
mutually exclusive with each other, and a stream processor can only
have one such stage.

.. _atlas-sp-checkpointing:

Checkpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~

{+atlas-sp+} captures the state of a stream processor using checkpoint
documents. These documents have unique IDs and are subject to the flow
of your stream processor logic. When the last operator of a stream
processor finishes acting on a checkpoint document, {+atlas-sp+}
commits the checkpoint, generating two types of records:

- A single record that validates the checkpoint ID and the stream
  processor to which it belongs
- A set of records describing the state of each stateful operation
  in the relevant stream processor at the instant {+atlas-sp+}
  committed the checkpoint.

When you restart a stream processor after an interruption,
{+atlas-sp+} queries the last committed checkpoint and resumes
operation from the described state.

.. _atlas-sp-dlq:

Dead Letter Queue
-----------------

{+atlas-sp+} supports the use of an |service| database collection as a 
:term:`dead letter queue` (DLQ). When {+atlas-sp+} cannot process a 
document from your data stream, it writes the content of the document 
to the DLQ along with details of the processing failure. You can assign
a collection as a DLQ in your stream processor definitions.

<streams-manage-create>`.
