The following steps describe how to create a system Data Source
Name (DSN) for the BI Connector's :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`
process. A DSN is a saved configuration which
describes a database connection to be
used by an :abbr:`ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)` driver.
Once the DSN is created for the |bi-short|, you can configure a wide
range of SQL clients and BI tools to use the DSN and import
data from MongoDB.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before creating a :abbr:`DSN (Data Source Name)`, you should:

   hidden: true

   tabs:
     - id: windows
       content: |
         - :ref:`Install the BI Connector <install-bic-windows>` and
           configure it to connect to your replica set.

           .. note::
              
              This prerequisite doesn't apply if you are using {+bi-atlas-short+}. 

         - Download and install `Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio
           2015 <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145>`__.

         - Download and install the {+odbc-driver+}.

     - id: macos
       content: |
         - :ref:`Install the BI Connector <install-bic-macos>` and configure it to connect to your replica set.

           .. note::
              
              This prerequisite doesn't apply if you are using {+bi-atlas-short+}. 

         - Download and install the {+odbc-driver+}.

     - id: linux
       content: |
         - Install the BI Connector on 
           :ref:`Red Hat Enterprise-based Linux <install-bic-rhel>` 
           or :ref:`Debian-based Linux <install-bic-debian>` and
           configure it to connect to your replica set.

           .. note::
              
              This prerequisite doesn't apply if you are using {+bi-atlas-short+}. 

         - Download and extract the {+odbc-driver+} for your platform.

         Example
         -------

         The following example configuration assumes the following:

         - A :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` instance running on ``localhost`` port
           ``3307`` with authentication enabled.
         - A :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/>` instance running with
           :manual:`authentication </reference/program/mongod#cmdoption-auth>` enabled.
         - A :manual:`MongoDB user </core/security-users/>` named
           ``dbUser`` who authenticates against the ``admin`` database
           and is authorized to use the ``test`` database.

         The values you enter may be different.

         The following procedure has been tested with Ubuntu and RHEL,
         and should work in a similar fashion with other Linux
         distributions.
