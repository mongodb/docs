The following diagram describes how the |k8s-op-short| reconciles changes
to the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` |k8s-crd| on each member |k8s| cluster.

.. _om-arch-steps:

1. The |k8s-op-short| creates or updates the
   ``<om_resource_name>-db-config`` secret. This secret contains
   the configurations that the {+mdbagent+} uses to start the
   {+appdb+} replica set.

2. The |k8s-op-short| creates or updates the ``<om_resource_name>-db``
   {+appdb+} StatefulSet. This StatefulSet contains at
   least three |k8s-pods|.

   - Each Pod runs one {+mdbagent+} instance. Each {+mdbagent+} starts a
     |mongod| instance on its Pod.
   - The |k8s-op-short| mounts the ``<om_resource_name>-db-config``
     secret to each Pod. The {+mdbagent+} uses this secret to
     configure the {+appdb+} replica set.

     In multi-cluster deployments, the |k8s-op-short| assigns the member
     cluster's index suffix to each {+appdb+}'s StatefulSet, in
     the form of ``<om_resource_name>-db-<cluster-idx>``, for example: ``om-db-1``.

3. The |k8s-op-short| creates or updates the ``<om_resource_name>``
   StatefulSet. In multi-cluster deployments, the |k8s-op-short| assigns
   the member cluster's index suffix to each StatefulSet, in the form of
   ``<om_resource_name>-<cluster-idx>``, for example: ``om-1``.

   The StatefulSet contains one Pod for each |onprem| replica. Each |onprem|
   replica connects to the {+appdb+}.

   Most changes to the ``MongoDBOpsManager`` |k8s-custom-resource|
   trigger a rolling upgrade of the Pods in the ``<om_resource_name>``
   StatefulSet. :ref:`Enabling TLS for the {+appdb+} <secure-om-db-tls>`
   also triggers a rolling restart because the connection string to the
   {+appdb+} changes. Changes to :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup <spec.backup.enabled>`
   don't trigger a rolling upgrade.

4. The |k8s-op-short| invokes |onprem| APIs to create an admin user.
   The |k8s-op-short| saves this admin user's credentials in the
   ``<om_resource_name>-admin-key`` secret. The |k8s-op-short| uses
   these credentials for all other |onprem| API invocations.
   This reconciliation step happens only once when you use the |k8s-op-short|
   to deploy a new |onprem| resource. The |k8s-op-short| skips this step
   when it updates the resource.

5. The |k8s-op-short| performs a rolling upgrade of the Pods in the ``<om_resource_name>-db``
   {+appdb+} StatefulSet to enable |onprem| to monitor it.
   Monitoring is enabled by default. This reconciliation step happens
   only once, such as when you deploy a new |onprem| resource.

6. If :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.enabled` is **true**, the |k8s-op-short|
   creates the ``<om_resource_name>-backup-daemon`` StatefulSet or
   verifies that it is running. The Backup Daemon connects to the same
   {+appdb+} as the |onprem| deployment.

   In multi-cluster deployments, the |k8s-op-short| assigns the member
   cluster's index suffix to each Backup Daemon's StatefulSet, in
   the form of ``<om_resource_name>-backup-daemon-<cluster-idx>``, for
   example: ``om-backup-daemon-1``.

7. If :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.enabled` is **true**, the |k8s-op-short|
   invokes |onprem| APIs to ensure that the |application|\'s backup
   configuration matches the one that you define in the custom resource
   definition.
