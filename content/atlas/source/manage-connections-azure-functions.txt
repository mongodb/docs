You can use :azure:`Azure Functions </azure-functions/>` with |service|.

Best Practices
--------------

Use the following best practices to properly manage connections
between :azure:`Azure Functions </azure-functions/>` and |service|:

- Define the client to the MongoDB server outside the ``Run`` method of 
  your :azure:`Azure function handler </azure-functions/create-first-function-cli-csharp/>`.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-create-mongoclient-once.rst

  The :ref:`azure-functions-example` reuses existing database 
  connections to speed up communication with the database and keep 
  connection counts to the database at a reasonable level with respect 
  to application traffic.

- Restrict network access to your |service| {+cluster+} from your Azure 
  Functions.
  
  Connect to your |service| {+cluster+} over private networking using a
  :doc:`Network Peering connection </security-vpc-peering>` 
  between your |service| {+cluster+} and your Azure Functions, or,
  alternatively, a :doc:`private endpoint 
  </security-private-endpoint/>`,
  so that you can allow only private IP addresses from your
  :doc:`IP access list </security/ip-access-list/>`.

  .. note::

     This configuration requires an 
     :azure:`Azure Functions Premium Plan 
     </azure-functions/functions-premium-plan>` with a 
     :azure:`Virtual Network (VNet) Integration 
     </azure-functions/functions-networking-options?tabs=azure-cli#virtual-network-integration>` configured. 

  If you don't use private networking, consider connecting to your
  |service| {+cluster+} using a :azure:`NAT gateway 
  </nat-gateway/nat-overview>`. Review 
  :azure:`outbound IP address changes 
  </azure-functions/ip-addresses#outbound-ip-address-changes>` and 
  :azure:`strategies for ensuring static outbound IP addresses 
  </azure-functions/ip-addresses#dedicated-ip-addresses>`.

Connection Example
------------------

The :github:`Azure Functions Example 
</mongodb-developer/csharp-atlas-azure-functions-example>` in the 
``mongodb-developer`` repository contains example code that shows how 
to work with the MongoDB C# driver and Azure Functions using |service|
{+clusters+}.
