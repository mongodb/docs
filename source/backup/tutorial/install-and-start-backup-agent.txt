==================================================
Install and Start the MongoDB Backup Service Agent
==================================================

.. start-content

The MongoDB Backup Service Agent polls the primary MongoDB instance of
every backup-enabled replica set and transmits the operations to 10gen.
The replica set must be MongoDB version 2.0 or later. To avoid resource
contention, run the agent on a host other than the hosts where the
MongoDB instances are running. Be sure the agent can access the MongoDB
hosts.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your data center is secured by a firewall, configure your firewall
to allow outbound connections on port ``443`` (SSL) to
``api-backup.10gen.com``.

Install and Start the Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Go to :guilabel:`Settings`.

#. Click on :guilabel:`Backup Agent`.

#. Click on the appropriate :guilabel:`Backup Agent` link ( ``tar.gz``
   or ``zip``) for your operating system.

#. Either unzip or untar the file in the preferred directory.

#. In the :file:`backup-agent` directory, issue the following command
   to start the agent:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      ./backup-agent

   For more information, see the :file:`Readme` included with the
