|service| limits the number of teams to a maximum of:

- 100 teams per project and
- 250 teams per organization.

|service| also limits |service| user membership to a maximum of:

- 500 per project and
- 500 per organization, which includes the combined membership of all
  projects in the organization.

|service| raises an error if an operation exceeds these limits. 

For example, if you have an organization with five projects, 
such that each project has 100 |service| users and each user 
belongs to only one project, you cannot add any |service| 
users to this organization or any project in that organization 
without first removing existing |service| users from the 
organization or project membership.
