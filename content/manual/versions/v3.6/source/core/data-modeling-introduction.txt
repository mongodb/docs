Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. Unlike SQL databases, where
you must determine and declare a table's schema before inserting data,
MongoDB's :term:`collections <collection>` do not enforce
:term:`document` structure. This flexibility facilitates the mapping of
documents to an entity or an object. Each document can match the data
fields of the represented entity, even if the data has substantial
variation. In practice, however, the documents in a collection share a
similar structure.

The key challenge in data modeling is balancing the needs of the
application, the performance characteristics of the database engine, and
the data retrieval patterns. When designing data models, always
consider the application usage of the data (i.e. queries, updates, and
processing of the data) as well as the inherent structure of the data
itself.

Document Structure
------------------

The key decision in designing data models for MongoDB applications
revolves around the structure of documents and how the application
represents relationships between data. There are two tools that allow
applications to represent these relationships: *references* and
*embedded documents*.

References
~~~~~~~~~~

References store the relationships between data by including
links or *references* from one document to another. Applications can
resolve these :doc:`references </reference/database-references>` to
access the related data. Broadly, these are *normalized* data models.

See :ref:`data-modeling-referencing` for the strengths and weaknesses of
using references.

Embedded Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Embedded documents capture relationships between data by storing
related data in a single document structure. MongoDB documents make it
possible to embed document structures in a field or
array within a document. These *denormalized* data models allow
applications to retrieve and manipulate related data in a single
database operation.

See :ref:`data-modeling-embedding` for the strengths and weaknesses of
embedding documents.

Atomicity of Write Operations
-----------------------------

In MongoDB, write operations are atomic at the :term:`document` level,
and no single write operation can atomically affect more than one
document or more than one collection. A denormalized data model with
embedded data combines all related data for a represented entity in a
single document. This facilitates atomic write operations since a
single write operation can insert or update the data for an entity.
Normalizing the data would split the data across multiple collections
and would require multiple write operations that are not atomic
collectively.

However, schemas that facilitate atomic writes may limit ways that
applications can use the data or may limit ways to modify applications.
The :ref:`Atomicity Considerations <data-model-atomicity>`
documentation describes the challenge of designing a schema that
balances flexibility and atomicity.

Document Growth
---------------

Some updates, such as pushing elements to an array or adding new
fields, increase a :term:`document's <document>` size. 

For the MMAPv1 storage engine, if the document size exceeds the
allocated space for that document, MongoDB relocates the document on
disk. When using the MMAPv1 storage engine, growth consideration can
affect the decision to normalize or denormalize data. See
:ref:`Document Growth Considerations <data-model-document-growth>` for
more about planning for and managing document growth for MMAPv1.

Data Use and Performance
------------------------

When designing a data model, consider how applications will use your
database. For instance, if your application only uses recently
inserted documents, consider using :doc:`/core/capped-collections`. Or
if your application needs are mainly read operations to a collection,
adding indexes to support common queries can improve performance.

See :doc:`/core/data-model-operations` for more information on these
and other operational considerations that affect data model designs.
