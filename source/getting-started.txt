This procedure guides you through creating and configuring an |service|
cluster, populating the cluster with data, and modifying that data.

A. Create an |service| User Account
-----------------------------------

*Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*

.. admonition:: |mms-full| Users
   :class: note

   If you are an existing |mms-full| user, you can use your |mms| credentials
   to `log in <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user#/login?jmp=docs>`_. You can then
   create a new |service| project from |mms|. 

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/add-atlas-project-cm-version.rst
   
   Once you have created a |service| project, you can move on to the next
   section.

Go to `cloud.mongodb.com
<https://cloud.mongodb.com/user#/register/accountProfile?nds=true>`_ to create
your user account. As a part of creating an |service| user, |service|
automatically creates a default :doc:`organization and project
</organizations-projects>` for you to deploy your first cluster into. You
can add additional :doc:`organizations </tutorial/manage-organizations>` and
:doc:`projects </tutorial/manage-projects>` later.

Creating a user for |service| also creates that user on `jira.mongodb.org
<http://jira.mongodb.org>`_. If you later change the user's password or email
address in |service|, you will also change the password or email address in
`jira.mongodb.org <http://jira.mongodb.org>`_.

Once you log in, the |service| UI automatically opens the cluster creation
dialog.

B. Create an |service| Free Tier Cluster
----------------------------------------

*Estimated completion time: 10 minutes*

|service| Free Tier clusters are an ideal development sandbox, providing
access to a :ref:`subset <atlas-free-tier>` of Atlas features and
functionality. You can deploy only one Free Tier cluster per |service| project.

Paid clusters provide full access to |service| features, configuration options,
and operational capabilities. For more information on Paid clusters,
including deployment instructions, see :doc:`/create-new-cluster`.

C. (Tutorial) Import Data to your Free Tier Cluster
---------------------------------------------------

*Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*

.. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-import-data.rst

For more information on importing data into |service|, see :doc:`/import`.

D. Modify Data in your Free Tier Cluster
--------------------------------------------

*Estimated completion time: 15 minutes*

.. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-manipulate-data.rst
