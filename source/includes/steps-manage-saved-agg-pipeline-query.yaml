       contents of the query on the connected chart.` 
             
       If you choose this option, the query will continue to be 
       available to any charts that used the query, but the query will 
       be disconnected from the library and unavailable for any new 
       charts.

     - :guilabel:`Delete query from the library, and remove the 
       contents of the query on the connected chart.`

       If you choose this option, the query will be removed from the 
       library and unavailable for any new or existing charts that used 
       the query.
