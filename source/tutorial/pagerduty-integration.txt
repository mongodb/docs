You can configure |service| to send alerts from your project to
your |pagerduty| dashboard. With PagerDuty integration, you can:

- Record incidents and notify on-call responders based on |service| 
  alerts.

- Automatically resolve incidents in PagerDuty when an |service| alert 
  is closed with bidirectional synchronization.

How it Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a PagerDuty integration, you can send |service| cluster event data 
to PagerDuty when |service| alerts that you specify are triggered. 
PagerDuty can create a new incident for the corresponding 
service, filter additional alerts from the same source into that 
incident, and alert on-call PagerDuty users.

Once the |service| alert has been resolved, PagerDuty resolves the 
incident.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To integrate |service| with PagerDuty, you must have a PagerDuty 
account.

If you do not have an existing PagerDuty account, you can sign up at
`<https://www.pagerduty.com/sign-up/>`__.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

First, navigate to the PagerDuty integration card:

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-pagerduty-integration.rst

You can configure an |service| integration with |pagerduty| in two ways:

- By signing into PagerDuty from the |service| 
  :guilabel:`Project Integrations` page, or

- By providing a valid :guilabel:`Integration Key`.

.. _pagerduty-integration-key-method:

Provide an :guilabel:`Integration Key`
``````````````````````````````````````
.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-pagerduty-integration-key.rst

.. important::

   The PagerDuty Events API does not fail when an invalid 
   :guilabel:`Integration Key` is provided. If your key is invalid, the 
   :guilabel:`Test Integration` button may falsely indicate a 
   successful integration.

   To confirm that your integration is successful, |service| sends an 
   initial alert. Check your PagerDuty dashboard for an initial 
   incident created by that |service| alert.

Remove a PagerDuty Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove the PagerDuty integration from your |service| project, 
click :guilabel:`Remove` on the PagerDuty card in your |service| 
project's :guilabel:`Project Integrations`.
