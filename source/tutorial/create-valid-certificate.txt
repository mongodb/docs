Create and Prepare a Valid SSL Certificate
==========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Create the certificate either through a 3rd-party authority or as a
self-signed certificate. If you have an existing certificate, you can use
that instead but still must prepare it. Preparing a certificate can
involve converting its format and concatenating it with other certificates
in a certificate chain.

Use the appropriate procedures in this section to generate and prepare the
certificate. To generate certificates must have access to the
``openssl`` utility.
