   :description: Monitor real-time performance in Atlas with the Real-Time Performance Panel, which tracks network traffic, database operations, and hardware statistics for M10+ clusters.

*Only available on M10+ clusters*

The Real-Time Performance Panel (RTPP) monitors and displays current
network traffic, database operations on the machines hosting MongoDB in
your clusters, and hardware statistics about the hosts. Use |rtpp| to
visually identify relevant database operations, evaluate query
execution times and the ratio of documents scanned to documents
returned, monitor network load and throughput, and  discover potential
replication lag on secondary members of replica sets.

.. note:: 
  
   :abbr:`RTPP (Real-Time Performance Panel)` might not work if your 
   workload triggers :method:`db.currentOp()` output that is greater than  
   the :abbr:`RTPP (Real-Time Performance Panel)` maximum size of 4MB per 
   sample. 

Required Access
---------------

To enable or disable :guilabel:`Real-Time Performance Panel` for a
project, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` access. Users with 
:authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add themselves 
to the project as a ``Project Owner``.

To view real-time performance in the Real-Time Performance Panel, you 
must have :guilabel:`Project Read Only`,
:authrole:`Project Observability Viewer`,
:authrole:`Project Data Access Read Only`,
:authrole:`Project Data Access Read/Write`, or
:authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` access to the project.

Graph View

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Chart/Location
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Connections, Network In, Network Out` (Top of panel)

     - Displays the number of current connections to the machine
       hosting MongoDB and the number of inbound and outbound bytes as
       reported by :binary:`mongostat`.

   * - :guilabel:`CPU, Disk IOPS, and Sys Mem` (Top of panel)

     - Displays the currently used percentage of CPU, disk read and 
       write operations per second, and the total physical memory 
       usage, excluding buffers and swap space, of the machine hosting 
       MongoDB.

   * - :guilabel:`Operations`

     - Displays the number of operations as reported by
       :binary:`mongostat`.

   * - :guilabel:`Query Execution Times`

     - Displays latency statistics for current read requests, write
       requests, and other database commands. Available in MongoDB 3.6
       or later. See ``opLatencies`` at :manual:`serverStatus
       </reference/command/serverStatus>` for more information.

   * - :guilabel:`Query Targeting`

     - Displays the ratio of documents and objects scanned to documents
       and objects returned in current queries. These statistics are
       useful in determining if and how a query uses an index. See
       :manual:`Analyze Query Performance </tutorial/analyze-query-plan>` for more information.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-query-targeting-mongot.rst

   * - :guilabel:`Reads & Writes`

     - Displays the number of active reads, queued reads, active
       writes, and queued writes as reported by :binary:`mongostat`.

   * - :guilabel:`Replication Lag`

     - Available only for secondary members of a replica set. Displays
       the time required to replicate operations from the primary to
       the secondary members of a replica set. See :manual:`Replica Set
       Secondary Members </core/replica-set-secondary>` for more
       information.

   * - :guilabel:`Hottest Collections`

     - Displays the collections with the most operations as reported by
       :binary:`mongotop`. For each hot collection, the table also
       displays the :guilabel:`Utilization Percent` for  the collection.

       :guilabel:`Utilization Percent` is calculated from the read and
       write times as reported by :binary:`mongotop` during a sample
       period. Specifically, the :guilabel:`Utilization Percent` is the
       percentage (rounded to the nearest 0.1%) of the read and write
       times for a collection relative to the read and write times for
       all collections in the deployment during the sample period. If
       no read and write operation occur during this period, the
       :guilabel:`Utilization Percent` will be 0%.

       The hottest collections correspond to the most current time
       displayed in the charts. That is, if the display is running
       (i.e. not paused), the collections correspond to the hottest
       collections at the current timestamp. If the display is paused,
       the collections correspond to the hottest collections at the
       paused time.

       If you have :manual:`Queryable Encryption 
       </core/queryable-encryption/>` enabled for a collection, the 
       |rtpp| doesn't display the collection in this location. 
       |service| redacts this information.

   * - :guilabel:`Slowest Operations`

     - Displays the slowest operations as reported by
       :manual:`db.currentOp() </reference/method/db.currentOp>`.

       The operations correspond to the most current time displayed in
       the charts. That is, if the display is running (i.e. not
       paused), the operations correspond to the slowest operations at
       the current timestamp. If the display is paused, the operations
       correspond to the slowest operations at the paused time.

       Select one of the operations to open the
       :guilabel:`Operation Details` panel, where you can
       terminate the selected operation using the :guilabel:`Kill Op`
       button. The :guilabel:`Kill Op` button issues the
       :manual:`db.killOp() </reference/method/db.killOp/>` method on
       the selected operation.

       If you have :manual:`Queryable Encryption 
       </core/queryable-encryption/>` enabled for a collection, the 
       |rtpp| hides the JSON view of the query if it involves 
       encrypted fields. |service| redacts this information.

Read Exact Metrics from Graph View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you pause the :guilabel:`Graph` view of the Real-Time Performance
Panel, you can hover over a line graph to see its exact value, along
with the slowest operations and hottest collections, at a given moment
in time.

Pausing the Performance Panel does not affect the collection of the
underlying data. When you resume the :guilabel:`Graph` view, the line
graphs restart from an empty display.
