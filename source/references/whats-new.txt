.. _version-5.1:

What's New in 5.1
-----------------

.. warning:: Deprecations in this release

   To avoid breaking changes in future major releases of the driver,
   replace any application code that depends on deprecated program elements.

This section includes the following information:

- :ref:`java-deprecations-5.1`
- :ref:`java-improvements-5.1`
- :ref:`java-new-features-5.1`

.. _java-deprecations-5.1:

  this option, see the :ref:`connection-options` guide.

.. _version-5.0:

What's New in 5.0
-----------------

.. warning:: Breaking changes in this release

  This driver version introduces breaking changes. For a list of these changes, see 
  the :ref:`Version 5.0 Breaking Changes section <java-breaking-changes-v5.0>` in the 
  Upgrade guide.

.. warning:: Deprecations in this release

   To avoid breaking changes in future major releases of the driver,
   replace any application code that depends on deprecated program elements.

This section includes the following information:

- :ref:`java-deprecations-5.0`
- :ref:`java-behavioral-changes-5.0`
- :ref:`java-new-features-5.0`

.. _java-deprecations-5.0:

Deprecations in 5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``org.mongodb.scala.Observable.completeWithUnit()`` method is deprecated.
  This method is not useful anymore because
  the driver now exposes ``org.mongodb.scala.Observable[Unit]``
  instead of ``org.mongodb.scala.Observable[Void]``.
  This relates to a :ref:`breaking change about Observables in this release
  <java-breaking-changes-v5.0-observables>`.

.. _java-behavioral-changes-5.0:

Behavioral changes in 5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``getElapsedTime()`` method on ``com.mongodb.event.ConnectionReadyEvent``
  includes the time taken to deliver the ``ConnectionCreatedEvent``. That is,
  the time returned includes the duration of the
  ``com.mongodb.event.ConnectionPoolListener.connectionCreated()`` method.

  The ``getElapsedTime()`` methods on
  ``com.mongodb.event.ConnectionCheckedOutFailedEvent`` and
  ``com.mongodb.event.ConnectionCheckedOutEvent`` include the time taken to
  deliver the ``com.mongodb.event.ConnectionCheckOutStartedEvent``. That is, the
  time returned includes the duration of the
  ``com.mongodb.eventConnectionPoolListener.connectionCheckOutStarted()`` method.

.. _java-new-features-5.0:

New features in 5.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 5.0 driver release introduces the following features:

- Adds support for the ``authorizedCollection`` option of
  the ``listCollections`` command. This was done by changing the
  ``com.mongodb.client.MongoDatabase.listCollectionNames()`` methods.
  The return type is now ``com.mongodb.client.ListCollectionNamesIterable``,
  while previously it was a ``MongoIterable<String>``.
  This change allows the return value to be
  configured using the ``ListCollectionNamesIterable.authorizedCollections()``
  method and specifying the ``authorizedCollections`` option. Equivalent changes
  were made to following classes and interfaces:

  - ``com.mongodb.reactivestreams.client.MongoDatabase``
  - ``org.mongodb.scala.MongoDatabase``
  - ``com.mongodb.kotlin.client.MongoDatabase``
  - ``com.mongodb.kotlin.client.coroutine.MongoDatabase``

  These changes introduce a :ref:`binary breaking change to the listCollectionsNames()
  method <java-breaking-changes-v5.0-list-collections>`. For more information
  about the ``MongoDatabase.listCollectionNames()`` method and the
  ``authorizedCollections`` option, see the
  :manual:`listCollections </reference/command/listCollections/>` Server manual
  page or :ref:`java-collection-names`.
  
.. note::

   The v5.0.2 patch release fixed an issue related to how domain names are validated when you use
   SOCKS5 proxy functionality, allowing you to use domain names with more than
   six characters in the top-level domain.

.. _version-4.11:

What's New in 4.11
------------------

This section includes the following information:

- :ref:`java-deprecations-4.11`
- :ref:`java-new-features-4.11`

.. _java-deprecations-4.11:

Deprecations in 4.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Deprecations in this release

   To avoid breaking changes in future major releases of the driver,
   replace any application code that depends on deprecated methods and types.

The 4.11 driver release deprecates the following items:

- The ``getStats()`` and ``isCapped()`` instance methods of the
  ``DBCollection`` class are deprecated. The corresponding server
  commands are deprecated in MongoDB v6.2 and later. Use the ``$collStats``
  aggregation pipeline stage to retrieve the information provided by these
  methods instead. You can run the aggregation as shown in the following code
  example:

  .. code-block:: java

     Cursor cursor = collection.aggregate(Arrays.asList(
             new BasicDBObject("$collStats",
                     new BasicDBObject("storageStats", new BasicDBObject()))),
             AggregationOptions.builder().build()
     );

  To determine whether a collection is a capped collection, access the value
  of the ``storageStats.capped`` field returned by ``Cursor`` instance in the
  preceding example aggregation.

  To learn more about the ``$collStats`` aggregation operator, see the
  :manual:`$collStats (aggregation) </reference/operator/aggregation/collStats/>`
  Server manual entry.

- The following network address-related methods are deprecated and will be removed
  in v5.0:

  - The `ServerAddress <{+core-api+}/ServerAddress.html>`__
    methods ``getSocketAddress()`` and ``getSocketAddresses()``.

    Instead of ``getSocketAddress()``, use the ``getByName()`` instance
    method of ``java.net.InetAddress``.

    Instead of ``getSocketAddresses()``, use the ``getAllByName()`` instance
    method of ``java.net.InetAddress``.

  - The `UnixServerAddress <{+core-api+}/UnixServerAddress.html>`__
    method ``getUnixSocketAddress()``.

    Instead of ``getUnixSocketAddress()``, construct an instance of
    ``jnr.unixsocket.UnixSocketAddress``. Pass the full path of the UNIX
    socket file to the constructor. By default, MongoDB creates a UNIX
    socket file located at ``"/tmp/mongodb-27017.sock"``. To learn more
    about the ``UnixSocketAddress``, see the `UnixSocketAddress <https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.github.jnr/jnr-unixsocket/latest/jnr/unixsocket/UnixSocketAddress.html>`__ API documentation.

- The following methods and types related to the
  `StreamFactory <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.10/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/StreamFactory.html>`__
  interface are deprecated and scheduled for removal in v5.0:

  - ``streamFactoryFactory()`` method from ``MongoClientSettings.Builder``
  - ``getStreamFactoryFactory()`` method from ``MongoClientSettings``
  - ``NettyStreamFactoryFactory`` class
  - ``NettyStreamFactory`` class
  - ``AsynchronousSocketChannelStreamFactory`` class
  - ``AsynchronousSocketChannelStreamFactoryFactory`` class
  - ``BufferProvider`` class
  - ``SocketStreamFactory`` class
  - ``Stream`` class
  - ``StreamFactory`` class
  - ``StreamFactoryFactory`` class
  - ``TlsChannelStreamFactoryFactory`` class

  If you configure Netty by using
  ``MongoClientSettings.Builder.streamFactoryFactory()``, your code might resemble
  the following:

  .. code-block:: java
     :emphasize-lines: 6
     :copyable: false

     import com.mongodb.connection.netty.NettyStreamFactoryFactory;

     // ...

     MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
             .streamFactoryFactory(NettyStreamFactoryFactory.builder().build())
             .build();

  Replace this code with the `TransportSettings.nettyBuilder() <{+core-api+}/connection/TransportSettings.html>`__
  as shown in the following example:

  .. code-block:: java
     :emphasize-lines: 6

     import com.mongodb.connection.TransportSettings;

     // ...

     MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
             .transportSettings(TransportSettings.nettyBuilder().build())
             .build();

.. _java-new-features-4.11:

New Features in 4.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New features of the 4.11 driver release include:

- Support for connecting to MongoDB by using a SOCKS5 proxy. To learn more
  see :ref:`java-connect-socks`.

.. note::

   The v4.11.3 patch release fixed an issue related to how domain names are validated when you use
   SOCKS5 proxy functionality, allowing you to use domain names with more than
   six characters in the top-level domain.

- Added the ``getSplitEvent()`` method to the ``ChangeStreamDocument`` class
  to identify fragments of a change stream event that exceeds 16MB. You must
  use the aggregation stage ``$changeStreamSplitLargeEvent`` in your change
  stream to handle events that exceed 16MB. To learn more, see :ref:`java-split-change-stream-events`.

- Added an aggregation stage builder for ``$vectorSearch``. To learn more, see :ref:`Atlas Vector Search <java-atlas-vector-search>`.

- Added Atlas Search index management helpers. To learn more, see :ref:`Atlas Search Indexes <search-indexes>`.

- Updated Snappy and Zstd compression library dependency versions. To learn
  more about the current dependency versions, see :ref:`java-compression`.
- Added ``getElapsedTime()`` methods to the following classes to monitor the
  duration of connection pool events:

  - `ConnectionCheckOutFailedEvent <{+core-api+}/event/ConnectionCheckOutFailedEvent.html>`__
  - `ConnectionCheckedOutEvent <{+core-api+}/event/ConnectionCheckedOutEvent.html>`__
  - `ConnectionReadyEvent <{+core-api+}/event/ConnectionReadyEvent.html>`__

- Support for Java 21 virtual threads and structured concurrency. The driver
  internals were updated to avoid unnecessary pinning of virtual threads
  and to preserve interrupted status of a thread, as the latter matters for
  structured concurrency where it is used for cancellation.

  To learn more about virtual threads, see the `Virtual Threads <https://openjdk.org/jeps/444>`__
  JDK enhancement proposal. To learn more about structured concurrency, see the
  `Structured Concurrency <https://openjdk.org/jeps/453>`__
  JDK enhancement proposal.

- Updated API documentation for the following types:

  - `ClusterListener <{+core-api+}/event/ClusterListener.html>`__
  - `ServerListener <{+core-api+}/event/ServerListener.html>`__
  - `ServerMonitorListener <{+core-api+}/event/ServerMonitorListener.html>`__

.. _version-4.10:

What's New in 4.10
------------------

New features of the 4.10 driver release include:

- Implementation of the ``Accumulators.percentile()`` and
  ``Accumulators.median()`` methods for statistical aggregations.
- Interfaces in the ``com.mongodb.client.model.search`` package are now
  marked as ``@Sealed`` instead of ``@Evolving``. Sealed interfaces must
  not be extended or implemented by consumers of the library.
- Resolved an issue where the driver emitted duplicate log messages for
  retry operations. The driver now correctly emits one log message for
  each retry operation.
- The ``org.bson.codecs.Parameterizable`` interface is deprecated. Instead of
  implementing this interface on a custom ``Codec`` type,
  override the ``CodecProvider.get()`` method on the
  codec's ``CodecProvider`` if the codec is intended for a parameterized
  type.
- Support for custom DNS resolvers.
- Support for :ref:`qe-manual-feature-qe` (QE). To learn
  more about the requirements for using the QE feature, see the
  :ref:`Queryable Encryption Driver Compatibility Table
  <qe-compatibility-reference>`.
