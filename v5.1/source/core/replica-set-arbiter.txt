.. start-content

In some circumstances (such as you have a primary and a secondary but
cost constraints prohibit adding another secondary), you may choose to
add an arbiter to your replica set. An arbiter does **not** have a copy
of the data set and **cannot** become a primary. However, an arbiter
participates in :ref:`elections for primary <replica-set-elections>`.
By default an arbiter has priority ``0``. An arbiter has exactly ``1``
election vote.

.. important::

   Do not run an arbiter on systems that also host the primary or the
   secondary members of the replica set.

To add an arbiter, see :doc:`/tutorial/add-replica-set-arbiter`.

Example

.. start-content-even-votes-example

For example, in the following replica set with a 2 data bearing members
(the primary and a secondary), an arbiter allows the set to have an odd
number of votes to break a tie:

Security
--------

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running with :setting:`~security.authorization`, arbiters exchange credentials with
other members of the set to authenticate. MongoDB encrypts the
authentication process, and the MongoDB authentication exchange is
cryptographically secure.

Because arbiters do not store data, they do not possess the internal table of user and role mappings
used for authentication.  Thus, the only way to log on to an arbiter with authorization active is to
use the :ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>`.


Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only communication between arbiters and other set members are:
votes during elections, heartbeats, and configuration data. These
exchanges are not encrypted.

**However**, if your MongoDB deployment uses TLS/SSL, MongoDB will encrypt
*all* communication between replica set members. See
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for more information.

As with all MongoDB components, run arbiters in trusted network
environments.
