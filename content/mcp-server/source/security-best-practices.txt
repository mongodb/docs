This page describes security best practices for the MongoDB MCP Server.

.. _mcp-server-security-best-practices-read-only-mode:

MCP Server Read-Only Mode
-------------------------

The MCP Server ``--readOnly`` :ref:`option
<mcp-server-configuration-options>` enables read-only mode.
``--readOnly`` restricts the MCP Server to only run :ref:`tools
<mcp-server-tools>` that perform read, connect, and metadata operations.

By default, read-only mode isn't enabled and the MCP Server allows
cluster write operations. To improve security, enable MCP Server
read-only mode and use a read-only database user to connect to clusters.

Read-only mode prevents accidental or malicious data modifications
performed with the MCP Server.

To enable read-only mode, include ``--readOnly`` in the MCP client
application JSON configuration file or on the command line, or set the
``MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY`` operating system environment variable to ``true``.
The following sections show examples of each method.

JSON Configuration File Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows ``--readOnly`` in the MCP client JSON
configuration file for the Claude Desktop client application:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 9

   {
      "mcpServers": {
         "MongoDB": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
               "-y",
               "mongodb-mcp-server@latest",
               "--readOnly"
            ],
            "env": {
               "MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING":
               "mongodb://localhost:27017/myDatabase"
            }
         }
      }
   }

For other example client JSON configuration files, see
:ref:`mcp-get-started-configure`.

Command Line Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example defines the MCP Server connection string in a Unix
environment variable to connect to an Atlas cluster:

.. code-block:: bash

   export MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb://localhost:27017/myDatabase"

The following example uses the previous environment variable, and also
sets an additional command line option:

.. code-block:: bash

   npx -y mongodb-mcp-server@latest --readOnly

Secrets and Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/environment-variables.rst

The following example sets the ``MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY`` environment
variable to ``true`` and sets the ``MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING``
environment variable:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 9-11

   "MongoDB": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
         "-y",
         "mongodb-mcp-server@latest",
      ],
      "env": {
         "MDB_MCP_READ_ONLY": "true",
         "MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING":
         "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27019/?directConnection=true"
      }
   }

For more information about environment variables, see
:ref:`mcp-server-configuration-environment-variables`.

Read-Only Database Access
-------------------------

For a secure deployment, use read-only database access with the MCP
Server:

- Create dedicated read-only database users for MCP Server connections.
- Use the database ``read`` role or create a custom read-only role for
  the database users.
- Never use database ``write`` credentials with the MCP Server.

Use cases for read-only database access:

- **Data analysis:** query and analyze production data without
  modification risk.
- **Reporting:** generate reports from live data.
- **Monitoring:** examine database metrics and performance indicators.
- **Development support:** allow developers to query production data for
  debugging purposes without allowing write access.

In addition, use the MCP Server ``--readOnly`` option to ensure
read-only data access. For details, see the earlier section
:ref:`mcp-server-security-best-practices-read-only-mode`.

Read-only database access is recommended for production. But, consider
limited write access for the following use cases:

- Development and staging environments.
- Perform administrative tasks with the correct authorization.
- Isolated test clusters with non-critical data.

MCP Server Deployment Options
-----------------------------

You can deploy the MCP Server locally or remotely.

Local MCP Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a local MCP Server, the MCP Server and the client application run
on the same computer.

A local MCP Server enables control over the installation environment:

- **Configuration and dependencies:** you manage the MCP Server software
  dependencies. To define the MCP Server parameters and database
  connections, edit files on the local computer.
- **Credentials security:** sensitive information for API keys and
  connection strings are stored locally in configuration files or
  environment variables. You secure the credentials.
- **Manual software updates:** when a new MCP Server version is
  available, users can download and install the MCP Server software.
  This can cause users to run different MCP Server versions.

When to Deploy MCP Server Locally
`````````````````````````````````

Deploy a local MCP Server for the following scenarios:

- Require easy configuration to get started with MCP Server on your
  computer.
- Manage your own configuration and updates.

Using Different Transport Protocols
```````````````````````````````````

The MCP transport protocols enable message communication between the
client application and the MCP Server. For a local MCP Server, use one
of the following transport protocols:

- **STDIO (Standard Input/Output):** the client application launches the
  MCP Server as a child process and communicates using operating system
  standard pipes (``stdin`` and ``stdout``). MongoDB recommends the
  STDIO transport protocol for local deployments.
- **Streamable HTTP:** the MCP Server starts a server on ``localhost``.
  The client communicates with the MCP Server using Streamable HTTP
  requests, which creates a persistent session. A unique session ID is
  included in a message header to maintain the state and context of the
  interaction.

.. warning::

   With Streamable HTTP, the MCP Server is bound to ``localhost
   (127.0.0.1)`` by default. This ensures the MCP Server only accepts
   connections that originate on the same computer.
   
   Binding to ``0.0.0.0`` exposes the MCP Server to the entire local
   network, which allows other devices on the same network to
   potentially access the MCP Server. This is a security risk and could
   allow unauthorized access to your database context. If you must
   expose the MCP Server outside of ``localhost``, implement security
   authentication described in
   :ref:`mcp-server-security-best-practices-authentication`.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Transport Protocols
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

STDIO creates a direct link between the client application and the MCP
Server. STDIO is best if only one application communicates with the MCP
Server because the application and the MCP Server are closely linked
together. When using STDIO, the MCP Server must run on the same computer
as the client application.

Streamable HTTP is flexible and operates like a private server on your
computer. Multiple clients can connect to the MCP Server. Streamable
HTTP is easy to test. Unlike STDIO, Streamable HTTP also allows
you to remotely deploy and locally deploy the MCP Server.

Remote MCP Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a remote MCP Server deployment, the MCP Server runs on a computer in
the cloud or on an on-premises server.

Client applications connect to the MCP Server over the network and use
Streamable HTTP. This provides a central shared environment that is
accessible to multiple users, automated systems, applications, and AI
agents.

Consider the following points for MCP Server remote deployments:

- Remote deployment has extra security risks and requires a secure
  configuration.
- At minimum, you need to configure network isolation, authentication to
  the MCP Server, and set up secrets management in the cloud or on
  premises.

Security Best Practices for Streamable HTTP
```````````````````````````````````````````

Communication in a remote MCP Server deployment typically uses
Streamable HTTP. Consider the following points for Streamable HTTP:

- Keep the MCP Server bound to ``localhost`` (``127.0.0.1``) for
  connections, which is the default.
- Binding to ``localhost`` requires administrators add a reverse
  proxy in front of the MCP Server. For example, use an Nginx reverse
  proxy.
- The MCP Server relies on the reverse proxy to stop malicious traffic
  before the traffic reaches the MCP Server.

Remote MCP Server Advantages
````````````````````````````

- **Central management:** security policies, logging, versioning,
  and access control are managed in one place.
- **Supports automation:** :abbr:`CI/CD (Continuous
  Integration/Continuous Deployment)` pipelines, automated testing
  frameworks, and other agents can operate as clients for automated
  workflows.

Remote MCP Server Disadvantages
```````````````````````````````

- **Additional hardware:** requires dedicated server and network
  infrastructure.
- **Complex security:** requires network security, authentication,
  authorization, and TLS certificate management.
- **Single point of failure:** if the remote server crashes, it affects
  all users. Consider implementing high availability for critical
  environments.

Remote MCP Server Security
--------------------------

In all MCP systems, authentication into the MCP Server is performed
separately from authentication to the service that the MCP Server
provides access to. The MongoDB MCP Server provides statically
configured access to the MongoDB instances that the MCP Server protects.

The MCP Server doesn't provide inbound authentication or authorization
functionality and you must configure authentication and authorization.
This is especially important to do for a remote MCP Server deployment
because the MCP Server is available on a network.

The following diagram shows an authentication workflow.

   :alt: Diagram of the MongoDB MCP Server authentication

.. _mcp-server-security-best-practices-authentication:

Protecting Connections to the MCP Server
----------------------------------------

All inbound connections to the MCP Server must be protected, otherwise
the database is exposed.

Connections must be protected even if the connection between the MCP
Server and the database is fully secured as described in the following
sections. This is because the MCP Server provides a separate connection
point.

Protecting inbound connections to the MCP Server requires an external
service that operates in parallel with the MCP Server. This typically
requires a reverse proxy to enforce access controls for inbound
connections. The proxy maps the access rights of the incoming request to
a specific MCP Server instance, which is statically configured to
connect to a MongoDB database instance either locally to the MCP Server
or to an Atlas cluster.

Other methods to protect the MCP Server are possible. For simplicity,
the following sections assume the use of a proxy pattern.

Delegated Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In delegated authorization, the user delegates a subset of their
authority to an agent. MongoDB recommends the use of OAuth 2.1 with
the MCP Server.

To operate with the MCP Server, a deployment must have an OAuth
Authorization Server (AS) protected by authenticated user accounts, and
a proxy in front of the MCP Server that operates as an OAuth Resource
Server (RS). The agent operates as an OAuth client.

OAuth delegation operates as follows:

1. Agent requests access to the MCP Server. The MCP Server is protected
   by a proxy.
#. Proxy sends the agent to the AS, which starts an authorization
   request
#. User logs in to the AS and authorizes the agent to access the RS,
   which is the proxy that protects the MCP Server.
#. Agent is given an access token to access the RS.
#. Agent uses the access token to call the MCP Server through the proxy.
#. Proxy validates the access token and allows the call to the MCP
   Server.
#. MCP Server receives the proxy request and runs the command
   on the database through the statically configured secure connection.

The MCP Server and the database never read the access token. The proxy
is trusted to protect the MCP Server. Bypassing the proxy risks access
to the MCP Server and the databases that the MCP Server can access.

The format of the token is hidden. :abbr:`JWTs (JSON Web Tokens)` are a
common format that allow the proxy to independently verify the token
issued by the AS.

Direct Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Direct authentication isn't recommended.**

With direct authentication, the agent provides credentials to the proxy.
The proxy authenticates the credentials. The credentials can be an API
key or other credential that identifies the agent. The pattern is simple
but has the following problems:

- Only the agent is identified, not the user for which the agent is
  acting.
- There is no method to audit who is taking which action through the MCP
  Server.
- Access is usually controlled centrally for all users, or directly at
  the proxy.

MCP Security Anti-Patterns
--------------------------

The following sections describe anti-patterns that you must not use.

User Impersonation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not use user impersonation.**

With user impersonation, the user provides their credentials directly to
the agent. The agent sends the credentials to the proxy for
authentication. User impersonation has the following problems:

- Only the user is identified. The fact that the agent acts on the
  user's behalf is hidden.
- User credentials are leaked to intermediate systems. This puts user
  accounts at risk.
- Actions the user can perform are allowed for the agent, and limited
  release of functions is impossible.
- Disconnecting an agent requires rotation of user credentials, which
  disrupts user accounts and systems.
- Non-phishable and non-replayable credentials cannot operate.

Pass-Through Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Do not use pass-through authentication.**

In pass-through authentication, the agent obtains and passes credentials
to access the database to the proxy. The proxy validates the credentials
and passes the credentials to the MCP Server. The MCP Server uses the
credentials to connect to the database. Pass-through authentication has
the following problems:

- Only copyable and replayable credentials can operate, which limits
  connections to low security options.
- The connection chain is hidden from the system.
- Anyone can potentially omit the next part of the chain.

Database and Network Security
-----------------------------

The method that the MCP Server uses to securely access the database are
separate from the method used to protect access to the MCP Server. The
following sections describe database and network security.

Database Authentication and Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MCP Server supports the following database authentication methods:

- Enterprise authentication with LDAP, X.509 certificates, OIDC, and
  Kerberos.
- Default SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication to provide strong password
  authentication.
- :abbr:`mTLS (Mutual TLS)` certificate authentication for service
  accounts and inter-cluster communication.

The MongoDB database supports the following authorization methods:

- :abbr:`RBAC (Role Based Access Control)` to limit database access.
- Granular database permissions to limit access to specific databases,
  individual collections, and operations like read, write, and
  administrative actions.
- Custom database roles for teams. For example, read-only access for
  analytics team and read-write access for operations team.
- Additional collection security to limit collection access.

Network Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recommendations for network isolation:

- Deploy clusters in a private :abbr:`VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)` or
  :abbr:`VNet (Virtual Network)` without direct Internet access.
- Secure connections to cloud private network with VPC peering and
  private endpoints.
- Restrict database access to specific IP addresses or :abbr:`CIDR
  (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)` blocks.

Recommendations for firewall configuration:

- Restrict access to MongoDB server port 27017 to authorized application
  servers only.
- Configure cloud firewall rules with security groups and an :abbr:`ACL
  (Access Control List)` for incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- Disable non-encrypted ports and enforce :abbr:`TLS (Transport Layer
  Security)` 1.2+ for all connections.
