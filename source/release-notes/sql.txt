*Released June 27, 2024*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.1.4.
- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.3.4.
- Publishes checksum for validating the signed msi for |odbc|.

*Released June 24, 2024*

- Updates the Tableau custom connector (for the MongoDB JDBC driver) to 
  version 1.3.0.
- Adds the ability to choose between two authentication types:

  - ``Certificate / Token``
  - ``Username and Password``

  If you choose ``Certificate / Token``, the username and password are not required.

*Released June 21, 2024*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.1.3.
- Introduces {+oidc+} authentication for the |jdbc| driver.

*Released May 22, 2024*

- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.3.3.
- Adds a checkbox on the |odbc| driver DSN configuration UI to 
  indicate whether to limit the maximum string length to 4000 
  characters. To work with BI tools, like Microsoft SQL Server 
  Linked Server, which can't handle variable length 
  string data with no known maximum length, you must enable this option.
 
*Released April 24, 2024*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.1.2, which now 
  ignores both "true" and "false" ``setAutoCommit``
  values instead of returning an exception when "true".

*Released April 22, 2024*

- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.3.0.
- Adds support for result set data column-wise binding.
- Adds support for SQLCancel.
- Changes the non-standard data type
  (such as ``document`` and ``oid``)
  default mapping from ``SQL_UNKNOWN_TYPE`` to
  ``SQL_WVARCHAR``. This change affects only programmatic 
  integrations relying on SQL type names; it doesn't affect Power BI.

*Released March 4, 2024*

- Updates the Power BI connector to version 1.2.0.
- Adds support for Direct Query. Direct Query capabilities require
  |odbc| driver version 1.2.0 or later.

*Released March 1, 2024*

- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.2.0.
- Adds support for |odbc| clients requesting the driver to exhibit |odbc| 2.0 behavior.
- Adds support for ``SQLFreeStatement``.
- Adds support for ``SQLFetchScroll``.
- The column order in result sets now adheres to the SQL-92 specification.
  Result set columns appear in the order they are listed in the ``SELECT`` query.
  For ``SELECT *``, the result set column order is unchanged. 
- Updates the information returned by ``SQLGetInfo``
  to report all supported date functions, time functions, and join capabilities.
- Removes log level configuration at the DSN and connection level. 
  The log level can now only be set as a driver property.
- Changes the |bson|-to-SQL mapping of ``Decimal128`` from 
  ``SQL_DECIMAL`` to ``SQL_UNKNOWN`` due to
  incompatibilities between ``Decimal128`` and ``SQL_DECIMAL``.

*Released February 23, 2024*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.1.1, which removes
  the SnakeYaml dependency and fixes an issue introduced in version 2.1.0
  where data retrieved by column name
  was pointing to the incorrect index. The driver now retrieves the data under 
  the correct index or reports an error if there are duplicate column names.

*Released January 22, 2024*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.1.0, which returns result set
  columns in the same order as the one provided in the select list instead
  of the alphabetical order.
- Fixes the logger to only apply the logging configuration to the driver
  handlers and not other applications handlers.

  policy for Power BI.
