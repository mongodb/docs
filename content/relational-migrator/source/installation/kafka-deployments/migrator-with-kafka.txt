{+rel-mig+} uses `Apache Kafka 
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/introduction/kafka-connect/#apache-kafka>`__ 
as a robust transport layer to migrate data from a source relational database 
to MongoDB. {+rel-mig+} can be used as a Kafka Connect plugin that 
improves resilience and scalability of big data migration jobs.

Use Cases
---------

{+rel-mig+} with Kafka is intended for large and long running jobs.
Kafka's built-in resilience ensures the migration job can recover and continue 
running if any component becomes temporarily unavailable. 

Behavior
--------

Architecturally, {+rel-mig+} is deployed within Kafka as a Kafka 
Connect sink connector. Database events are captured using the open-source 
`Debezium tool <https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/connectors/index.html>`__ 
for database change data capture (CDC). A Debezium Connector captures these events 
from your source database.

   * - Deployment Method
     - Description

   * - :ref:`<install-kafka-cluster>`

     - This deployment method is ideal if you are already running Kafka or 
       have your own approach to installing and configuring Kafka.

   * - :ref:`<install-confluent-kafka>` 

     - Confluent Cloud is an official MongoDB partner providing a fully-managed 
       cloud-based Kafka solution. This deployment method is ideal if you want the 
       reliability of Kafka without having to manage your own cluster.
