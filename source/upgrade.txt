Overview
--------

This page describes the changes you must make to your application
when you upgrade to a new version of the {+driver-short+}.

Before you upgrade, perform the following actions:

- Ensure the new {+driver-short+} version is compatible with the {+mdb-server+} versions
  your application connects to and the C++ standard version your
  application compiles with. For version compatibility information, see the
  :ref:`{+driver-short+} Compatibility <cpp-compatibility>`
  page.
- Address any breaking changes between the driver version
  your application is using and your planned upgrade version in the
  :ref:`Breaking Changes <cpp-breaking-changes>` section.

.. tip::

   To ensure compatibility across {+mdb-server+} versions when
   upgrading driver versions, use the
   :ref:`{+stable-api+} <cpp-stable-api>`.

Definition of Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   The {+driver-short+} follows :wikipedia:`semantic versioning. <Software_versioning#Schemes>`
   The driver may break build system or package compatibility in any release.
   Patch releases may revert accidental API breaking changes.

   For more information, see :ref:`<cpp-api-abi-versioning>`.

A breaking change is a change of a convention or a behavior starting in a specific
version of the driver. This type of change may prevent your application from working
properly if not addressed before upgrading the driver.

The breaking changes in this section are categorized by the driver version that introduced
them. When upgrading driver versions, address all the breaking changes between the current
and upgrade versions.

.. example:: Upgrading to Version 4.0

  If you're upgrading the {+driver-short+} from version 3.x to version 4.0,
  address all breaking changes that are listed for versions 3.x up to and
  including version 4.0

Types of Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New versions of the {+driver-short+} can introduce the following types of breaking changes:

- **API** changes concern the API of the {+driver-short+} libraries. These changes are
  accompanied by an API major version bump. You might need to edit C++ source code
  in your project to address these changes.

  .. example::

     - Removes the declaration of function ``v1::func()``. (The definition is still
       provided for ABI compatibility.)
     - Removes the inline function ``v_noabi::func()``.
     - Removes ``v_noabi::func()``.
     - Changes the redeclaration of ``bsoncxx::foo`` from ``v1::foo`` to ``v2::foo``.
       To continue using the old interface, qualify ``bsoncxx::foo`` as ``bsoncxx::v1::foo``.

- **ABI** changes concern the ABI of the {+driver-short+} libraries. These changes are
  accompanied by an ABI version bump, and may also be accompanied by an API major version
  bump. You might need to rebuild your project or edit your C++ source code to address
  these changes.

  ABI stability is **not** supported for symbols corresponding to entities declared in
  the ``v_noabi`` namespace. Breaking changes for such symbols are not necessarily
  accompanied by an ABI version bump.

  .. example::

     - Removes the exported symbol ``v_noabi::func()``.
     - Removes the exported symbol ``v1::func()``.
     - Removes the exported symbols for ``v1::type``.

- **Build system** changes concern the build system or packaging of the {+driver-short+}
  libraries. These changes are not necessarily accompanied by either an API major version
  bump or an ABI version bump.
  To address these changes, you might need to modify your build system configurations or
  update your project's package or dependency management settings. You might also need to
  modify or rebuild your C++ source code.

  .. example::

     - Removes the ``ENABLE_FOO`` configuration variable.
     - Changes the default value of the ``ENABLE_BAR`` configuration variable from
       ``OFF`` to ``ON``.
     - Drops support for platform A, compiler B, or architecture C.

Breaking Changes
----------------

The following sections describe the breaking changes introduced by 
each driver version release.

.. _upcoming-breaking-changes:
.. _version-4.1-breaking-changes:

Version 4.1
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _version-4.1-build-system-breaking:

Build System Breaking Changes in v4.1
`````````````````````````````````````

The v4.1 driver introduces the following breaking changes to the build system:

- Requires MongoDB C Driver v2.0.0 or later.
- Declares C++17 polyfill implementations for ``optional<T>`` and ``string_view`` in the ``bsoncxx::v1::stdx`` namespace. The
  ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::stdx`` namespace now contains type aliases to their v1
  equivalents.

  .. note::

     This does not affect users who compile with C++17 or newer and have not set ``BSONCXX_POLY_USE_IMPLS=ON``

.. _version-4.0-breaking-changes:

Version 4.0
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _version-4.0-build-system-breaking:

Build System Breaking Changes in v4.0
`````````````````````````````````````

The v4.0 driver introduces the following breaking changes to the build system:

- Drops support for the Boost and MNMLSTC/core external polyfill libraries. You can no
  longer set the following configuration options:

  - ``ENABLE_BSONCXX_POLY_USE_IMPLS``. This option is implicitly set to ``ON``.
  - ``BSONCXX_POLY_USE_MNMLSTC``.
  - ``BSONCXX_POLY_USE_SYSTEM_MNMLSTC``.
  - ``BSONCXX_POLY_USE_BOOST``.

- Drops support for the ``MONGOCXX_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_INSTALL_PREFIX`` configuration
  option. Default CMake behavior for ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` is now respected.

- Sets the ``ENABLE_TESTS`` configuration option to ``OFF`` by default. To
  re-enable building test targets, you must set ``ENABLE_TESTS`` to ``ON``.
  To include test targets in the "all" target, you must also set the
  ``BUILD_TESTING`` option to ``ON``.

.. _version-4.0-api-breaking:

API Breaking Changes in v4.0
````````````````````````````

The v4.0 driver introduces the following breaking changes to the API:

- Drops support for configuring ``bsoncxx::stdx::string_view`` and
  ``bsoncxx::stdx::optional<T>`` as aliases for Boost or MNMLSTC/core
  library equivalents. For context, see the :ref:`Build System Breaking Changes
  <version-4.0-build-system-breaking>` section.

- Removes the following header files:

  - ``<bsoncxx/stdx/make_unique.hpp>``
  - ``<bsoncxx/types/value.hpp>``
  - ``<bsoncxx/util/functor.hpp>``
  - ``<mongocxx/options/create_collection.hpp>``
  
- Removes the following deprecated ``utf8`` types and functions that have ``string`` equivalents:

  - ``k_utf8`` from the ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::type`` class. Instead, use ``k_string``.
  - ``b_utf8`` from the ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::types`` class. Instead, use ``b_string``.
  - ``get_utf8()`` from the ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::document::element``, ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::array::element``,
    and ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::view`` classes. Instead, use ``get_string()``.
  - ``k_cannot_append_utf8`` from the ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::exception::error_code`` class.
    Instead, use ``k_cannot_append_string``.
  - ``k_need_element_type_k_utf8`` from the ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::exception::error_code`` class.
    Instead, use ``k_need_element_type_k_string``.

- Removes the ``mongocxx::stdx`` namespace. Replace the following
  types in your code:

  - ``mongocxx::stdx::optional<T>``. Instead, use ``bsoncxx::stdx::optional<T>``.
  - ``mongocxx::stdx::string_view``. Instead, use ``bsoncxx::stdx::string_view``.

- Removes the following undocumented ``using`` directives and declarations:

  - ``bsoncxx::builder::types`` from the ``<bsoncxx/builder/list.hpp>`` header file.
    Instead, use ``bsoncxx::types`` from ``<bsoncxx/types.hpp>``.
  - ``bsoncxx::builder::stream::concatenate`` from the ``<bsoncxx/builder/stream/helpers.hpp>``
    header file. Instead, use ``bsoncxx::builder::concatenate`` from ``<bsoncxx/builder/concatenate.hpp>``.
  - ``mongocxx::events::read_preference`` from the ``<mongocxx/events/topology_description.hpp>``
    header file. Instead, use ``mongocxx::read_preference`` from ``<mongocxx/read_preference.hpp>``.

ABI Breaking Changes in v4.0
````````````````````````````

The v4.0 driver introduces the following breaking changes to the ABI:

- Drops support for configuring ``bsoncxx::stdx::string_view`` and
  ``bsoncxx::stdx::optional<T>`` as aliases for Boost or MNMLSTC/core
  library equivalents. For context, see the :ref:`Build System Breaking Changes
  <version-4.0-build-system-breaking>` section.

- Removes deprecated ``utf8`` functions that have ``string`` equivalents.
  For a full list of these changes, see the :ref:`API Breaking Changes <version-4.0-api-breaking>`
  section.

.. _version-3.11-breaking-changes:

Version 3.11
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build System Breaking Changes in v3.11
``````````````````````````````````````

The v3.11 driver introduces the following breaking changes to the build system:

- Drops support for {+mdb-server+} v3.6.
- Requires MongoDB C Driver v1.28.0 or later.
- If the ``ENABLE_TESTS`` configuration option is set to ``ON``, C++14 or later
  is required. You can opt out of the C++14 requirement by disabling tests with 
  ``ENABLE_TESTS=OFF`` during CMake configuration.

ABI Breaking Changes in v3.11
`````````````````````````````

The v3.11 driver introduces the following breaking changes to the ABI:

- Removes export of the following private member functions in the bsoncxx
  ABI:

  .. code-block::
     :copyable: false

     bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::value::value(const uint8_t*, uint32_t, uint32_t, uint32_t)

     bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::view::_init(void*)

     bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::view::view(const uint8_t*, uint32_t, uint32_t, uint32_t)

     bsoncxx::v_noabi::types::bson_value::view::view(void*)


- Removes export of the following private member functions in the mongocxx
  ABI:

  .. code-block::
     :copyable: false 
     
     mongocxx::v_noabi::options::change_stream::as_bson()

     mongocxx::v_noabi::options::aggregate::append(bsoncxx::v_noabi::builder::basic::document&)

     mongocxx::v_noabi::options::index::storage_options()


- Declare all exported functions symbols with ``__cdecl`` when compiled with
  MSVC. This is an ABI breaking change if you use an alternative
  default calling convention when building projects.

.. _version-3.10-breaking-changes:

Version 3.10
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build System Breaking Changes in v3.10
``````````````````````````````````````

The v3.10 driver introduces the following breaking changes to the build system:

- Drops support for calling ``find_package(libbsoncxx)`` and
  ``find_package(libmongocxx)``. Use ``find_package(bsoncxx)`` and
  ``find_package(mongocxx)`` instead.
- Drops support for the ``LIBBSONCXX_*`` and ``LIBMONGOCXX_*`` CMake variables
  provided by the legacy CMake package config files. Use the ``mongo::bsoncxx_*`` and
  ``mongo::mongocxx_*`` CMake targets instead.
- Removes the ``BSONCXX_POLY_USE_STD_EXPERIMENTAL`` CMake option and drops support for selecting
  the experimental C++ standard library as a polyfill option.

.. _version-3.9-breaking-changes:

Version 3.9
~~~~~~~~~~~

Build System Breaking Changes in v3.9
`````````````````````````````````````

The v3.9 driver introduces the following breaking changes:

- Removes support for exported targets from the CMake project build tree
- Drops support for macOS 10.14, macOS 10.15, and Ubuntu 14.04
