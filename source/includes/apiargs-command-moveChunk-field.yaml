  An equality match on the shard key that specifies the shard-key value

   Starting in MongoDB 3.4, for :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`,
   defaults to ``false``.
      
   - If ``true``, then by default, each document move during chunk
     migration propagates to at least one secondary before the balancer
     proceeds with the next document. This is equivalent to a write
     concern of :writeconcern:`{ w: 2 } <\<number\>>`. 

     Use the ``writeConcern`` option to specify a different write concern.

   - If ``false``, the balancer does not wait for replication to a
     secondary and instead continues with the next document.

   For more information, see
   :ref:`sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle`.
