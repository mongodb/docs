"Sharding is the process of storing data records across multiple machines and "
"is MongoDB's approach to meeting the demands of data growth. As the size of "
"the data increases, a single machine may not be sufficient to store the data "
"nor provide an acceptable read and write throughput. Sharding solves the "
"problem with horizontal scaling. With sharding, you add more machines to "
"support data growth and the demands of read and write operations."
