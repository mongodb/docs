Hashed indexes maintain entries with hashes of the values of the
indexed field. The hashing function collapses sub-documents and
computes the hash for the entire value but does not support multi-key
(i.e. arrays) indexes.

Hashed indexes support :doc:`sharding </core/sharding-introduction>` a
collection using a :ref:`hashed shard key <sharding-hashed-sharding>`.
Using a hashed shard key to shard a collection ensures a more even
distribution of data. See
:doc:`/tutorial/shard-collection-with-a-hashed-shard-key` for more
details.

MongoDB can use the ``hashed`` index to support equality queries, but
``hashed`` indexes do not support range queries.

You may not create compound indexes that have ``hashed`` index fields
or specify a unique constraint on a ``hashed`` index; however, you can
create both a ``hashed`` index and an ascending/descending (i.e.
non-hashed) index on the same field: MongoDB will use the scalar index
for range queries.

.. _hashed-index-warning:

.. include:: /includes/warning-hashed-index-floating-point.rst

Create a ``hashed`` index using an operation that resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.active.ensureIndex( { a: "hashed" } )

This operation creates a hashed index for the ``active`` collection on
the ``a`` field.

.. COMMENTED OUT the footnote.. Used to belong to a point item that was
   removed 6 months ago.
   .. [#hash-size] The hash stored in the ``hashed`` index is 64 bits of the
      128 bit ``md5`` hash.
