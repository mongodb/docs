|service| collects and displays metrics for your servers, databases, and
MongoDB processes. |service| displays three charts in the :guilabel:`Clusters`
view and additional charts in the :guilabel:`Metrics` view.

Metrics Displayed in the Clusters View
--------------------------------------

The :guilabel:`Clusters` view displays charts that monitor your disk usage,
IOPS, and database operations. If the collected metrics indicate you need to
add capacity to your cluster, see :doc:`/scale-cluster`.

From the :guilabel:`Clusters` view you can see the following:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Chart

     - Data

   * - :guilabel:`Disk Usage`

     - The total bytes of used disk space for the cluster.
       For a :term:`replica set`, the chart displays disk
       use on the server that hosts the :term:`primary`. For a :term:`sharded
       cluster`, the chart displays the sum of disk usage on all servers that
       host a primary. The top line of the chart shows the maximum storage
       capacity on the server or servers.

       To view disk use on a specific server in the cluster, click the
       server's name, then click the :guilabel:`Hardware` tab, and then locate
       the :guilabel:`Disk Space Used` chart.

   * - :guilabel:`Disk IOPS`

     - The input/output operations per second (IOPS) for the cluster. Each
       point on the chart is the sum of read IOPS and write IOPS.

       For a replica set, the chart shows IOPS for the primary. For a sharded
       cluster, the chart shows the sum of the IOPS on all primaries in the
       sharded cluster. The top line of the chart shows the maximum IOPS
       configured for the server or servers.

       To view IOPS for a specific server in the cluster, click the server's
       name, then click the :guilabel:`Hardware` tab, and then locate the
       :guilabel:`Disk IOPS` chart.

   * - :guilabel:`Operations`

     - The aggregated read and write operations for the cluster's databases.
       The ``Read`` line aggregates all ``query`` and ``getMore`` operations.
       The ``Write`` line aggregates ``update``, ``delete``, and ``insert``
       operations.

       For a replica set, the chart shows operations for the primary. For a
       sharded cluster, the chart shows the sum of the operations on all
       primaries in the sharded cluster.

       To view a specific operation by server, click the server's name to open
       the server's metrics. Click the :guilabel:`Status` tab. Select the
       :guilabel:`Display Opcounters on Separate Charts` checkbox to display
       operations on separate charts. Deselect the checkbox to display
       operations on a single :guilabel:`Opcounters` charts.

View All Metrics
----------------

To view metrics, locate the cluster on the :guilabel:`Clusters` tab and click
:guilabel:`Metrics`. |service| displays metrics at the granularity last
selected. You can select different granularities.

To add or remove charts, click either the :guilabel:`Display` or
:guilabel:`Add Chart` drop-down list, depending on which is available. To
display chart controls, hover the mouse pointer over the chart. To view
metrics at a different level of the cluster topology, use the breadcrumb.

For more information on chart metrics, see the following on this page:

.. _metrics-sharded-clusters:

Sharded Cluster Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you view metrics for a :term:`sharded cluster`, you choose to display
either :term:`shards <shard>`, :term:`mongos instances <mongos>`, or
:term:`config servers <config server>`. When displaying shards, you can use
the buttons below the chart to select primaries, secondaries, or both.
|service| displays different processes as different lines.

To sum or average the data, click the :guilabel:`Display Data` drop-down list
and select the desired option. To change charts, click the :guilabel:`Display`
drop-down list.

.. _metrics-replica-sets:

Replica Set Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you view metrics for a replica set, you can limit the display to
particular member types using the :term:`P <primary>`, :term:`S <secondary>`,
and :term:`A <arbiter>` options.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75
   
   * - Chart/Table
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Memory`

     - Displays the memory stats as reported by :program:`mongostat
       <bin.mongostat>`. For a description of the fields, see
       :manual:`mongostat </reference/program/mongostat/#fields>`.

       fields, see :manual:`mongostat
       </reference/program/mongostat/#fields>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Operations`

     - Displays the number of operations as reported by
       :program:`mongostat <bin.mongostat>`. For a description of the
       fields, see :program:`mongostat <bin.mongostat>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Reads & Writes`

     - Displays the number of active reads, queued reads, active
       writes, queued writes as reported by :program:`mongostat
       <bin.mongostat>`. For a description of the fields, see
       :manual:`mongostat </reference/program/mongostat/#fields>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Hottest Collections`

     - Displays the collections with the most operations as reported by
       :program:`mongotop <bin.mongotop>`. For each hot collection, the
       table also displays the :guilabel:`Scaled Load` percentage for
       the collection. 

       :guilabel:`Scaled Load` is calculated from the read and write
       times as reported by :program:`mongotop <bin.mongotop>` during a
       sample period. Specifically, the :guilabel:`Scaled Load` is the
       percentage (rounded to the nearest 0.1%) of the read and write
       times for a collection relative to the read and write times for
       all collections in the deployment during the sample period. If
       no read and write operation occur during this period, the
       :guilabel:`Scaled Load` may be 0%.

       The hottest collections correspond to the most current time
       displayed in the charts. That is, if the display is running
       (i.e. not paused), the collections correspond to the hottest
       collections at the current timestamp. If the display is paused,
       the collections correspond to the hottest collections at the
       paused time.

   * - :guilabel:`Slowest Operations`

     - Displays the slowest operations as reported by
       :manual:`db.currentOp() </reference/method/db.currentOp>`. 
       
       The operations correspond to the most current time displayed in
       the charts. That is, if the display is running (i.e. not
       paused), the operations correspond to the slowest operations at
       the current timestamp. If the display is paused, the operations
       correspond to the slowest operations at the paused time.
       
       To view the JSON document as reported by
       :manual:`db.currentOp() </reference/method/db.currentOp>` for
       the operation, click on the operation.

To hide/show a metric in the graph, click on the color box for the
metric.

Stop and Restart Display
````````````````````````

To stop the update of the stats displayed, click the :guilabel:`Pause`
button. The :guilabel:`Pause` button only stops the update of the
displays and does not pause the collection of the underlying data.

To restart the display updates, click :guilabel:`Play`.

.. _metrics-db-stats-tab:

DB Stats Tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tab displays database metrics |service| collects through the MongoDB
``dbStats`` command. |service| collects a subset of ``dbStats`` output. See
:manual:`dbStats </reference/command/dbStats>` in the MongoDB manual.

|service| retrieves database metrics every 20 minutes by default but adjusts
frequency when necessary to reduce the impact on
database performance. If the collection of database statistics still affects
performance, you can disable collection by clicking :guilabel:`Settings`, then
:guilabel:`Group Settings`, and then setting :guilabel:`Collect Database
Specific Statistics` to ``No``.

To select which database to display, click the :guilabel:`Select Database`
drop-down list.
