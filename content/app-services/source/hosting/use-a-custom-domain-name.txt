Use a Custom Domain Name
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 2
   :class: singlecol

Overview
--------

You can use your own custom domain name for your hosted content. By
default, content that you upload is available at a domain with the
following form:

.. code-block:: none

   <Your App ID>.mongodbstitch.com

You can configure a custom domain name for your application's hosted
content from the App Services UI or by :ref:`importing
<deploy-cli>` an application configuration
directory that specifies the domain in its ``config.json`` configuration
file. Select the tab below that corresponds to the method you want to
use.

         .. step:: Acquire the Custom Domain Name

            You must own the custom domain name that you want to serve content
            from. If you don't already own the domain that you want to use, you
            will need to purchase it from a domain name registrar.


         .. step:: Specify the Custom Domain in Atlas App Services

            You need to provide your custom domain name to App Services before it will
            serve content from the domain. To specify the domain:

            1. Click :guilabel:`Hosting` in the left navigation menu.

            2. Click the :guilabel:`Settings` tab.

            3. Under :guilabel:`Custom Domain`, set the toggle to
               :guilabel:`Enabled`.

            4. Enter your custom domain in the input box under the
               :guilabel:`Enabled` toggle. This value should be the root domain
               without any subdomains. For example, you should enter
               ``example.com`` instead of ``www.example.com``.

            5. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

            .. note::

              If an error is encountered during custom domain name validation,
              App Services sends the project owner an email alerting them of the
              issue.


         .. step:: Add a Validation CNAME Record

            To verify that you own the domain you must add a new :wikipedia:`CNAME
            record <CNAME_record>` in your domain's DNS configuration. The
            :guilabel:`Custom Domain` section will include an information box that
            lists the host name and target value to use in the record.

            Once you have added the validation record it may take some time for the
            DNS record to propagate. App Services will periodically check the domain's
            DNS records for the validation ``CNAME`` and will mark the domain as
            verified if it finds the record.

            .. tip:: Troubleshooting

               - In the :guilabel:`Name` field of the App Services UI, App Services provides
                 the full address for the CNAME record, ``<Subdomain>.<Your Base Domain>``.
                 However, many hosting providers just request the ``<Subdomain>`` part
                 to put in their UI. If you run into issues, check your hosting provider's
                 documentation on how to add CNAME records.

               - App Services may not be able to find the validation record if your DNS
                 provider proxies requests for the domain. If App Services cannot validate
                 your domain, ensure that you have disabled any HTTP proxies for the
                 validation CNAME record on your DNS provider.

               - If an error is encountered during custom domain name validation,
                 App Services sends the project owner an email alerting them of the
                 issue.


         .. step:: Add a Redirect CNAME Record

            Once App Services has verified your domain, all that's left is to add a
            ``CNAME`` DNS record for your domain that points to the default App Services
            domain. Use the following host name and target value:

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1
               :widths: 10 30

               * - Value
                 - Description

               * - Host Name
                 - A subdomain such as ``www``.

               * - Target
                 - The default domain for your application. This value is listed
                   as the :guilabel:`App Services Domain` in the :guilabel:`Settings` tab
                   of the :guilabel:`Hosting` page. The default domain has the
                   following form:

                   .. code-block:: none

                      <Your App ID>.mongodbstitch.com


   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Acquire the Custom Domain Name

            You must own the custom domain name that you want to serve content
            from. If you don't already own the domain that you want to use, you
            will need to purchase it from a domain name registrar.


         .. step:: Pull the Latest Version of Your App

            To configure a custom domain name with the {+cli-ref+}, you need a local copy of
            your application's configuration files.

            To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

            .. tip::

               You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
               the :guilabel:`Deploy > Import/Export App` screen in the App Services UI.


         .. step:: Specify the Custom Domain

            In ``hosting/config.json``, set ``custom_domain`` to your custom domain name
            then save the file.

            .. code-block:: json
               :caption: hosting/config.json

               {
                 "enabled": true,
                 "custom_domain": "example.com"
               }

            .. note::

               The value of ``custom_domain`` should be the root domain without
               any subdomains. For example, you should enter ``example.com``
               instead of ``www.example.com``.


         .. step:: Import the Application Directory

            Once you have specified your custom domain name, you can import the
            application directory.

            Navigate to the root of the application directory and run the
            following command:

            .. code-block:: shell

               {+cli-bin+} import --include-hosting


         .. step:: Deploy the Updated Hosting Configuration

            Once you've updated and saved ``hosting/config.json`` you can push the updated
            config to your remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys the configuration on
            push and App Services immediately starts trying to verify your domain name.

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} push --remote="<Your App ID>" --include-hosting


         .. step:: Add a Validation CNAME Record

            To verify that you own the domain you must add a new :wikipedia:`CNAME
            record <CNAME_record>` in your domain's DNS configuration. You can
            find the host name and target value to use in the record
            :guilabel:`Custom Domain` section of the :guilabel:`Hosting >
            Settings` tab in the App Services UI.

            Once you have added the validation record it may take some time for the
            DNS record to propagate. App Services will periodically check the domain's
            DNS records for the validation ``CNAME`` and will mark the domain as
            verified if it finds the record.

            .. tip:: Troubleshooting

               - In the :guilabel:`Name` field of the App Services UI, App Services provides
                 the full address for the CNAME record, ``<Subdomain>.<Your Base Domain>``.
                 However, many hosting providers just request the ``<Subdomain>`` part
                 to put in their UI. If you run into issues, check your hosting provider's
                 documentation on how to add CNAME records.

               - App Services may not be able to find the validation record if your DNS
                 provider proxies requests for the domain. If App Services cannot validate
                 your domain, ensure that you have disabled any HTTP proxies for the
                 validation CNAME record on your DNS provider.

               - If an error is encountered during custom domain name validation,
                 App Services sends the project owner an email alerting them of the
                 issue.


         .. step:: Add a Redirect CNAME Record

            Once App Services has verified your domain, all that's left to do is to add one or
            more ``CNAME`` DNS records for your domain that point to the default
            App Services domain. Use the following host name and target value:

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1
               :widths: 10 30

               * - Value
                 - Description

               * - Host Name
                 - A subdomain such as ``www``.

               * - Target
                 - The default domain for your application. This value is listed
                   as the :guilabel:`App Services Domain` in the :guilabel:`Settings` tab
                   of the :guilabel:`Hosting` page. The default domain has the
                   following form:

                   .. code-block:: none

                      <Your App ID>.mongodbstitch.com


.. note:: Add App Services's AWS CAAs to Verify Your Domain

   If you have trouble verifying your domain:
   
   - clear any unnecessary :wikipedia:`CAA <DNS_Certification_Authority_Authorization>`'s
     from your site's records
     
   - add the following CAA records:

     .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 20 20 20 20 20

        * - Domain
          - Record Type
          - Flags
          - Tag
          - Value

        * - ``www.example.com``
          - ``CAA``
          - ``0``
          - ``issue``
          - ``"amazon.com"``

        * - ``www.example.com``
          - ``CAA``
          - ``0``
          - ``issue``
          - ``"amazontrust.com"``

        * - ``www.example.com``
          - ``CAA``
          - ``0``
          - ``issue``
          - ``"awstrust.com"``
