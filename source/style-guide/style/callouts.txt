Callouts and Admonitions
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Callouts or admonitions emphasize important or helpful information.
To avoid clutter on the page and to preserve visual impact, use callouts
sparingly.

Callout Anatomy
---------------

A callout contains the following parts:

1. Label that indicates the callout type
2. Optional title
3. Body text

Callout Types
-------------

You can use the following callouts:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 60 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Callout Type
     - Description
     - Directive
   * - Tip
     - Provides useful information that might improve product
       performance or make procedures easier to follow. Tips provide
       the following benefits:

       - Help users learn techniques or procedures
       - Show alternative ways of doing something
       - Provide shortcuts
       - Provide helpful (but not essential) information

     - ``.. tip:: <title>``

   * - Note
     - Provides information that emphasizes or supplements information
       in the text. A note can provide information that applies only in
       certain cases.
     - ``.. note:: <title>``
   * - Important
     - Presents an important or essential point. As a rule, users must
       pay attention to important callouts to complete a task or
       understand a topic.
     - ``.. important:: <title>``
   * - Warning
     - Alerts users to potential hazards or highlights critical
       information. Use a warning for situations in which users could
       lose data, compromise data integrity, or disrupt operations if
       they don't follow instructions carefully.
     - ``.. warning:: <title>``

Callout Guidelines
------------------

When you create callouts, use the following guidelines:

- Use the appropriate callout type to convey the kind of information 
  you want to communicate. 

- Don't stack multiple callouts directly after one another, as these can
  distract users. To avoid stacking callouts, group supplemental 
  information from callouts into a dedicated section. For callouts of 
  the same type, use a single callout that contains separate paragraphs 
  or an unordered list.

- If possible, don't use callouts in tables and option lists.
  Callouts reduce the scannability of tables and options lists.

- Avoid nesting callouts inside tables, code blocks, and other elements.

- Place a callout as close as possible to the information that it
  emphasizes or clarifies.

- Use callouts for long form text and avoid using callouts for links 
  only.

- Use callouts only when needed and avoid overcrowding the 
  page with callouts.

The following callouts might appear in existing documentation but are
deprecated. Don't use these callouts in new content:

- ``.. admonition::``
- ``.. caution::``
- ``.. danger::``
- ``.. example::``
- ``.. see::``
- ``.. see also::``
- ``.. topic::``
