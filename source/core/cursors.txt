Cursors
=======

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In the :program:`mongo` shell, the primary method for the read
operation is the :method:`db.collection.find()` method. This method
queries a collection and returns a :term:`cursor` to the returning
documents.

To access the documents, you need to iterate the cursor. However, in
the :program:`mongo` shell, if the returned cursor is not assigned to a
variable, then the cursor is automatically iterated up to 20 times
[#set-shell-batch-size]_ to print up to the first 20 documents in the
results.

For example, the following read operation queries the ``inventory``
collection for documents that have ``type`` equal to ``'food'``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find( { type: 'food' } );

The :program:`mongo` shell will automatically print up to the first 20
matching documents. To manually iterate the cursor to access the
documents, see :doc:`/tutorial/iterate-a-cursor`.

.. _cursor-behaviors:

Cursor Behaviors
----------------

Closure of Inactive Cursors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the server will automatically close the cursor after 10
minutes of inactivity or if client has exhausted the cursor. To
override this behavior, you can specify the ``noTimeout``
:meta-driver:`wire protocol flag </legacy/mongodb-wire-protocol>` in
your query; however, you should either close the cursor manually or
exhaust the cursor. In the :program:`mongo` shell, you can set the
``noTimeout`` flag:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var myCursor = db.inventory.find().addOption(DBQuery.Option.noTimeout);

See your :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>` documentation for
information on setting the ``noTimeout`` flag. See
:ref:`cursor-flags` for a complete list of available cursor flags.

Cursor and Isolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the cursor is not isolated during its lifetime, intervening
write operations on a document may result in a cursor that returns a
document more than once if that document has changed. To handle this
situation, see the information on :ref:`snapshot mode
<faq-developers-isolate-cursors>`.

Cursor and Batches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB server returns the query results in batches. Batch size
will not exceed the :ref:`maximum BSON document size
<limit-bson-document-size>`. For most queries, the *first* batch
returns 101 documents or just enough documents to exceed 1 megabyte.
Subsequent batch size is 4 megabytes. To override the default size of
the batch, see :method:`~cursor.batchSize()` and
:method:`~cursor.limit()`.

For queries that include a sort operation *without* an index, the
server must load all the documents in memory to perform the sort and
will return all documents in the first batch.

As you iterate through the cursor and reach the end of the returned
batch, if there are more results, :method:`cursor.next()` will perform
a :data:`getmore operation <currentOp.op>` to retrieve the next batch.
To see how many documents remain in the batch as you iterate the
cursor, you can use the :method:`~cursor.objsLeftInBatch()` method, as
in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var myCursor = db.inventory.find();

   var myFirstDocument = myCursor.hasNext() ? myCursor.next() : null;

   myCursor.objsLeftInBatch();

Cursor Information
------------------

You can use the command :dbcommand:`cursorInfo` to retrieve the
following information on cursors:

- total number of open cursors

- size of the client cursors in current use

- number of timed out cursors since the last server restart

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { cursorInfo: 1 } )

The result from the command returns the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "totalOpen" : <number>,
     "clientCursors_size" : <number>,
     "timedOut" : <number>,
     "ok" : 1
   }

.. _cursor-flags:

Cursor Flags
------------

The :program:`mongo` shell provides the following cursor flags:

- ``DBQuery.Option.tailable``
- ``DBQuery.Option.slaveOk``
- ``DBQuery.Option.oplogReplay``
- ``DBQuery.Option.noTimeout``
- ``DBQuery.Option.awaitData``
- ``DBQuery.Option.exhaust``
- ``DBQuery.Option.partial``
