the :ref:`cpp-security` section.

Specialized Data Formats
------------------------

Learn how to work with specialized data formats and custom types in the
:ref:`cpp-data-formats` section.

Advanced Installation Options
-----------------------------

Learn about advanced configuration and installation options
in the :ref:`cpp-installation-advanced` section.

What's New
----------

For a list of new features and changes in each version, see the :ref:`cpp-whats-new`
section.

Upgrade Driver Versions
-----------------------

Learn what changes you might need to make to your application to upgrade driver versions
in the :ref:`cpp-upgrade` section.

Issues & Help
-------------

Learn how to report bugs, contribute to the driver, and find help in the
:ref:`cpp-issues-help` section.

Compatibility
-------------

For compatibility tables that show the recommended {+driver-short+}
version to use for specific C++ and {+mdb-server+} versions, see the
:ref:`cpp-compatibility` section.

API Documentation
-----------------

For detailed information about types and methods in the {+driver-short+}, see
the `{+driver-short+} API documentation <{+api+}>`__.

.. _cpp-polyfill-config:

C++17 Polyfill Configuration
----------------------------

.. important::

   We recommend using the C++ standard library whenever possible by setting the
   ``CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`` configuration option to ``17`` or newer.

The {+driver-long+} uses C++17 features ``std::optional<T>`` and ``std::string_view``.
If you configure the driver with a pre-C++17 standard, the bsoncxx library provides
polyfill implementations for these C++17 features. The driver uses the bsoncxx polyfill
implementations when the ``CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`` configuration option is set to a number
less than ``17``. By default, this option is set to ``11``.

.. warning:: 

   The choice of polyfill library has a direct impact on the public API and ABI for the mongocxx
   library. Changing the polyfill can lead to both source-breaking changes during compilation
   and binary-breaking changes during linking or execution. To limit reliance on polyfill-specific
   behavior, avoid using ``stdx::string_view`` and ``stdx::optional<T>`` with non-bsoncxx and non-mongocxx
   library interfaces.

Driver Status by Family and Version
-----------------------------------

Stability indicates whether this driver is recommended for production use.
Currently, no drivers guarantee API or ABI stability.

For documentation about previous releases, see the `legacy documentation <https://mongocxx.org/legacy-v1/>`__.

Current Driver
--------------

The mongocxx is a ground-up rewrite of a C++ driver for MongoDB based on
`libmongoc <https://mongoc.org/>`__.  It requires a C++11 compiler.  It is
known to build on x86 and x86-64 architectures for Linux, macOS,
Windows, and FreeBSD.

The mongocxx driver library includes a matching bson package, bsoncxx, that
implements the `BSON specification <http://www.bsonspec.org>`__. This
library can be used standalone for object serialization and deserialization
even when one is not using MongoDB at all.

Releases of the mongocxx driver have version numbers like v3.x.y.

.. note::
    
   There were no v2.x.y C++ drivers to avoid confusion with the deprecated legacy-0.0-26compat-2.x.y drivers.
