You can modify a deployment's configuration and topology, including its
MongoDB versions, storage engines, and numbers of hosts or shards. You
can make modifications at all levels of a deployment's topology from a
top-level :term:`sharded cluster <sharded cluster>` or
:term:`replica set` to lower levels, such as a replica set within a
sharded cluster, or an individual process within a replica set. You can
also modify :term:`standalone <standalone>` processes.
