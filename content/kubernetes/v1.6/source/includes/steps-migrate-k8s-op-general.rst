.. step:: Upgrade to v1.33 of the MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator.

          For instructions on upgrading from an earlier version of the |k8s-op-short| 
          to v1.33, see the `upgrade guide <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes-operator/v1.33/tutorial/upgrade-k8s-operator/>`__.

.. step:: Scale down the MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator to 0 replicas.

          This prevents both MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator and |k8s-op-full| from running in parallel.
