Highlight Search Terms in Results
=================================

The |fts| ``highlight`` option adds fields to the result set
that display search terms in their original context.
You can use it in conjunction with :ref:`$search <query-syntax-ref>`
operators to display search terms as they appear in the returned
documents, along with the adjacent text content (if any). ``highlight``
results are returned as part of the ``$meta`` field.

.. seealso:: 

   `Stemming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming>`__

Syntax
------

``highlight`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 7-11 

   {
     $search: {  
       "index": "<index name>", // optional, defaults to "default"
       "<operator>": { // such as "text", "compound", or "phrase"
         <operator-specification>
       },
       "highlight": { 
         "path": "<field-to-search>",
         "maxCharsToExamine": "<number-of-chars-to-examine>", // optional, defaults to 500,000
         "maxNumPassages": "<number-of-passages>" // optional, defaults to 5
       }
     }
   }, 
   { 
     $project: { 
       "highlights": { "$meta": "searchHighlights" }
     }
   }

Options 
-------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 10 55 10

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Required?

   * - ``path``
     - string
     - Document field to search. The ``path`` field may contain:

       - A string
       - An array of strings
       - A :ref:`multi analyzer <ref-multi-analyzers>` specification
       - An array containing a combination of strings and multi    
         analyzer specifications
       - A wildcard character ``*`` 
         
       See :ref:`ref-path` for more information.

     - yes

   * - ``maxCharsToExamine``
     - int
     - Maximum number of characters to examine on a document when 
       performing highlighting for a field. If omitted, defaults to 
       ``500,000``, which means that |fts| only examines the first 
       500,000 characters in the search field in each document 
       for highlighting. 
     - no

   * - ``maxNumPassages``
     - int
     - Number of high-scoring passages to return per document in the 
       ``highlights`` results for each field. A passage is roughly the 
       length of a sentence. If omitted, defaults to 5, which means 
       that for each document, |fts| returns the top 5 highest-scoring 
       passages that match the search text.
     - no

The ``"$meta": "searchHighlights"`` field contains the highlighted 
results. That field isn't part of the original document, so it is 
necessary to use a :manual:`$project 
</reference/operator/aggregation/project>` pipeline stage to add it to 
the query output.

Output 
------

The ``highlights`` field is an array containing the following
output fields:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 20 15 65

  * - Field
    - Type
    - Description

  * - ``path``
    - string
    - Document field which returned a match.

  * - ``texts``
    - array of documents
    - Each search match returns one or more objects, containing
      the matching text and the surrounding text (if any).

  * - ``texts.value``
    - string
    - Text from the field which returned a match.

  * - ``texts.type``
    - string
    - Type of result. Value can be one of the following:
      
      - ``hit`` - The results contain the term that matched the query. 
      - ``text`` - The results contain the text content adjacent 
        to the matching term. 

  * - ``score``
    - float
    - :ref:`Score <scoring-ref>` assigned to the matching
      result. The ``highlights`` score is a measure of the relevance 
      of the ``highlights`` object to the query. If multiple 
      ``highlights`` objects are returned, the most relevant 
      ``highlights`` object has the highest score.  

.. _highlight-egs:

Examples
--------

The examples on this page use a collection called ``fruit`` that contains 
the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "_id" : 1,
     "type" : "fruit",
     "summary" : "Apple varieties",
     "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp. The most popular varieties are McIntosh, Gala, and Granny Smith."
   },
   {
     "_id" : 2,
     "type" : "fruit",
     "summary" : "Banana",
     "description" : "Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six."
   },
   {
     "_id" : 3,
     "type" : "fruit",
     "summary" : "Pear varieties",
     "description" : "Bosc and Bartlett are the most common varieties of pears."
   }

The ``fruit`` collection also has an :ref:`index definition 
<ref-index-definitions>` that uses the :ref:`english 
<ref-language-analyzers>` analyzer and dynamic field mappings.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "analyzer": "lucene.english",
     "searchAnalyzer": "lucene.english",
     "mappings": {
       "dynamic": true
     }
   }

.. note::

   One useful aspect of highlighting is that it reveals the original 
   text returned by the search query, which may not be exactly the same 
   as the search term. For example, if you use a 
   :ref:`language-specific analyzer <ref-language-analyzers>`, your 
   text searches return all the `stemmed 
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming>`__ variations of your 
   search terms.
 
   Another useful aspect of highlighting is that it can be used to 
   highlight any field, inside or outside of the query ``path``. For 
   example, when you search for a term, you can perform highlighting 
   for the query term on the query field and any other fields that you 
   specify using the ``highlight`` option. To learn more, see 
   :ref:`Multi-Field Example <highlight-multi>`. 

.. _highlight-basic:

Basic Example 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query searches for ``variety`` and ``bunch`` in the
``description`` field of the ``fruit`` collection, with the
``highlight`` option enabled.

The :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` 
pipeline stage restricts the output to the ``description`` field 
and adds a new field called ``highlights``, which contains 
highlighting information.

.. code-block:: json

    db.fruit.aggregate([
      {
        $search: {
          "text": {
            "path": "description",
            "query": ["variety", "bunch"]
          },
          "highlight": { 
            "path": "description"
          }
        }
      }, 
      { 
        $project: {
          "description": 1,
          "_id": 0,
          "highlights": { "$meta": "searchHighlights" }
        }
      }
    ])

The query returns the following results:

.. code-block:: json
    :copyable: false

    {
      "description" : "Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six. ",
      "highlights" : [
        {
          "path" : "description",
          "texts" : [
            {
              "value" : "Bananas are usually sold in ",
              "type" : "text"
            },
            {

            {
              "value" : " of five or six. ",
              "type" : "text"
            }
          ],
          "score" : 1.2841906547546387

              "value" : "Bosc and Bartlett are the most common ",
              "type" : "text"
            },
            {
              "value" : "varieties",
              "type" : "hit"
            },
            {
              "value" : " of pears.",
              "type" : "text"

    }
    {
      "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp. The most popular varieties are McIntosh, Gala, and Granny Smith. ",
      "highlights" : [
        {
          "path" : "description",
          "texts" : [
            {
              "value" : "Apples come in several ",
              "type" : "text"
            },
            {
              "value" : "varieties",
              "type" : "hit"
            },
            {
              "value" : ", including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp. ",
              "type" : "text"
            }
          ],
          "score" : 1.0330637693405151
        },
        {
          "path" : "description",
          "texts" : [
            {
              "value" : "The most popular ",
              "type" : "text"
            },
            {
              "value" : "varieties",
              "type" : "hit"
            },
            {
              "value" : " are McIntosh, Gala, and Granny Smith. ",
              "type" : "text"
            }
          ],
          "score" : 1.0940992832183838
        }
      ]
    }

The search term ``bunch`` returns a match on the document with 
``_id: 2``, because the ``description`` field contains the word 
``bunches``. The search term ``variety`` returns a match on the 
documents with ``_id: 3`` and ``_id: 1``, because the 
``description`` field contains the word ``varieties``. 

.. _highlight-advanced:

Advanced Example 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query searches for ``variety`` and ``bunch`` in the
``description`` field of the ``fruit`` collection, with the
``highlight`` option enabled, maximum number of characters to 
examine set to ``40``, and only ``1`` high-scoring passage to 
return per document.

The :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` 
pipeline stage restricts the output to the ``description`` field 
and adds a new field called ``highlights``, which contains 
highlighting information.

.. code-block:: json

    db.fruit.aggregate([
      {
        $search: {
          "text": {
            "path": "description",
            "query": ["variety", "bunch"]
          },
          "highlight": {
            "path": "description",
            "maxNumPassages": 1,
            "maxCharsToExamine": 40
          }
        }
      },
      {
        $project: {
          "description": 1,
          "_id": 0,
          "highlights": { "$meta": "searchHighlights" }
        }
      }
    ])

The query returns the following results:

.. code-block:: json
    :copyable: false

    {
      "description" : "Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six. ",
      "highlights" : [
        {
          "path" : "description",
          "texts" : [
            {
              "value" : "Bananas are usually sold in ",
              "type" : "text"
            },
            {
              "value" : "bunches",
              "type" : "hit"
            },
            {
              "value" : " of f",
              "type" : "text"
            }
          ],
          "score" : 1.313065767288208
        }
      ]
    }
    {
      "description" : "Bosc and Bartlett are the most common varieties of pears.",
      "highlights" : [ ]
    }
    {
      "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp. The most popular varieties are McIntosh, Gala, and Granny Smith.",
      "highlights" : [
        {
          "path" : "description",
          "texts" : [
            {
              "value" : "Apples come in several ",
              "type" : "text"
            },
            {
              "value" : "varieties",
              "type" : "hit"
            },
            {
              "value" : ", includ",
              "type" : "text"
            }
          ],
          "score" : 0.9093900918960571
        }
      ]
    }
    

The second document in the above results contains an empty 
``highlights`` array even though the search field contains the 
search term ``varieties``, because |fts| only examined ``40`` 
characters for highlighting. Similarly, the word ``includ`` is 
truncated because |fts| only examined ``40`` characters in the 
search field for highlighting. In the third document, although 
multiple passages contain the search term, |fts| returns only 
one passage in the ``highlights`` results because the query 
required only ``1`` passage per document in the ``highlights`` 
results.

.. _highlight-multi:

Multi-Field Example 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query searches for ``varieties`` in the
``description`` field of the ``fruit`` collection, with the
``highlight`` option enabled for both the ``description`` 
and ``summary`` fields. 

The :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` 
pipeline stage adds a new field called ``highlights``, which 
contains highlighting information for the query term across 
all fields in the ``highlight`` option. 

.. code-block:: json

    db.fruit.aggregate([
      {
        $search: {
          "text": {
            "path": "description",
            "query": "varieties"
          },
          "highlight": {
            "path": ["description", "summary" ]
          }
        }
      },
      {
        $project: {
          "description": 1,
          "summary": 1,
          "_id": 0,
          "highlights": { "$meta": "searchHighlights" }
        }
      }
    ])

The query returns the following results:

.. code-block:: json
    :copyable: false
    :emphasize-lines: 6, 19, 43, 57, 75

    {

          "score" : 1.0330637693405151 
        }, 
        {

          "texts" : [ 
            {

            { 
              "value" : " are McIntosh, Gala, and Granny Smith.",

          ], 
          "score" : 1.0940992832183838 
        } 
      ] 
    }

The search term ``varieties`` returns a match on documents with 
``_id: 1`` and ``_id: 3`` because the query field ``description`` 
in both documents contains the query term ``varieties``. In 
addition, the ``highlights`` array includes the ``summary`` field 
because the field contains the query term ``varieties``.

.. _highlight-wildcard:

Wildcard Example 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query searches for the term ``varieties`` in fields 
that begin with ``des`` in the ``fruit`` collection, with the 
``highlight`` option enabled for fields that begin with ``des``. 

The :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` 
pipeline stage adds a new field called ``highlights``, which 
contains highlighting information. 

.. code-block:: json

          },
          "highlight": { 
            "path": {"wildcard": "des*"}
          }
        }
      },

Autocomplete Example 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this example, the ``fruit`` collection also has the 
following :ref:`index definition <ref-index-definitions>`.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "mappings": {
       "dynamic": false,
       "fields": {
         "description": [
          {
           "type": "autocomplete",
           "tokenization": "edgeGram",
           "minGrams": 2,
           "maxGrams": 15,
           "foldDiacritics": true
          }
         ]
       }
     }
   }

The following query searches for the characters ``var`` in the 
``description`` field of the ``fruit`` collection, with the 
``highlight`` option enabled for the ``description`` field. 

The :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` 
pipeline stage adds a new field called ``highlights``, which 
contains highlighting information.

.. important::

   To highlight the autocomplete indexed version of a path, the 
   :ref:`autocomplete operator <autocomplete-ref>` must be the only 
   operator that uses that path in the query.

.. code-block:: json

   db.fruit.aggregate([
      {
        $search: {
          "autocomplete": {
            "path": "description",
            "query": ["var"]
          },
          "highlight": { 
            "path": "description"
          }
        }
      }, 
      { 
        $project: {
          "description": 1,
          "_id": 0,
          "highlights": { "$meta": "searchHighlights" }
        }
      }
   ])

The query returns the following results.

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 9, 18, 35

          { "value": "varieties of pears", "type": "hit" },
          { "value": ".", "type": "text" }
        ]
      }
    ]
   }

|fts| returns a match on the documents with ``_id: 1`` and 
``id_: 2`` for the query string ``var``  because the ``description`` 
field in the ``fruit`` collection contains the characters  
``var`` at the beginning of a word. |fts| matches a highlight ``hit`` 
more coarsely to your query terms when a highlighted path is referenced 
only in the autocomplete operators of the highlighted query.
