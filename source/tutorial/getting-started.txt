|mms| is a service that lets you create, manage, monitor, and back up
MongoDB deployments. You can use |mms| to create new deployments and
manage existing ones. To manage existing deployments you download
|mms| agents to your deployment servers.

To use |mms| you create |a-mms| :doc:`group </tutorial/create-group>`,
which will provide access to a distinct set of MongoDB processes and
users. You can create multiple groups.

You can get started with |mms| in minutes by going to
`https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager?jmp=docs>`_ 
and starting a free trial. |mms| walks you through registration and the setup of your
first deployment. The choices you make during setup do not limit your
choices for the future.
