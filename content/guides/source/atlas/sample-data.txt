What You'll Need
----------------

- A MongoDB account. See :ref:`guides-create-atlas-account`.
- An Atlas cluster. See :ref:`guides-create-a-cluster`.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/navigate_to_collections.rst
      
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Load Sample Dataset`.

      .. figure:: /images/sample-data-load.png
         :figwidth: 600px
         :alt: sample-data-load
      
      .. note:: 

         If Atlas prompts you to select which dataset to load, select
         ``sample_guides``.

   .. step:: In the ensuing dialog, click :guilabel:`Load Sample Dataset` confirm.

      .. figure:: /images/sample-data-confirm-load.png

      Once the load completes, the :guilabel:`Collections` tab refreshes 
      to show your sample data.

      You see the following databases in your cluster:
