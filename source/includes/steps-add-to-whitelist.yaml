  .. important:: Ensure that you add the IP address you will use to access
     MongoDB as the admin user.

  Enter the desired IP address or CIDR-notated range of addresses:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 40 60

     * - Entry

       - Grants

     * - An IP address

       - Access from that address.

     * - A CIDR-notated range of IP addresses

       - Access from the designated range of addresses.

         For peer VPC connections, you can specify the CIDR block (or a
         subset) or the associated Security Group.
         
         The Internet provides online tools for converting a range of IP
         addresses to CIDR, such as `<http://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr>`_.

     * - Security Group (AWS Only)

       - Access via Security Group membership for peer VPC connections.

     * - ``0.0.0.0/0``

       - Unrestricted access. All IP addresses have access to your project's clusters.

         .. note:: 

            For production clusters, avoid adding ``0.0.0.0/0`` to the
            cluster's whitelist as this can expose the cluster to
            denial of service attacks.
