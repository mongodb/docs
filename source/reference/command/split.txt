.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: split

   The :dbcommand:`split` command creates new :term:`chunks <chunk>`
   in a :term:`sharded <sharding>` environment. While splitting is
   typically managed automatically by the :program:`mongos` instances,
   this command makes it possible for administrators to manually
   create splits.

   In most clusters, MongoDB will manage all chunk creation and
   distribution operations without manual intervention.

.. include:: /includes/warning-splitting-chunks.rst

   Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { split : "test.people" , find : { _id : 99 } } )

   This command inserts a new split in the collection named
   ``people`` in the ``test`` database. This will split the chunk
   that contains the document that matches the query ``{ _id : 99
   }`` in half. If the document specified by the query does not (yet)
   exist, the :dbcommand:`split` will divide the chunk where that
   document *would* exist.

   The split divides the chunk in half, and does *not* split the chunk
   using the identified document as the middle. To define an arbitrary split
   point, use the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { split : "test.people" , middle : { _id : 99 } } )

   This form is typically used when :term:`pre-splitting` data in a
   collection.

   :dbcommand:`split` is an administrative command that is only
   available for :program:`mongos` instances.
