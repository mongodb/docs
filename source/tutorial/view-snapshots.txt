Overview
--------

By default, |mms| takes a base snapshot of a backed-up deployment every 6
hours and retains snapshots as described in
:ref:`snapshot-frequency-and-retention`. Administrators can change the
frequency and retention settings.

You can view all available snapshots, as described here.

On-Demand Snapshots
-------------------

By default, |mms| takes on-demand snapshots with the same retention that you 
configured on the :ref:`snapshot settings <edit-snapshot-schedule>` for the 
daily snapshot. An on-demand snapshot doesn't alter the existing snapshot 
schedule. You can view on-demand snapshots on your :guilabel:`View All Snapshots` 
page.

.. note::

   - When you add or remove a shard from your cluster, |mms| initiates an on-demand 
     snapshot. 
     
   - If |mms| is configured to take automated snapshots, on-demand snapshots 
     are not available in the time between |mms| instance creation and 
     the first automated snapshot. If you require an on-demand snapshot before 
     the first automated snapshot is scheduled to occur, see :ref:`<snapshot-frequency-and-retention>` 
     to learn about adjusting the automated snapshot interval.
