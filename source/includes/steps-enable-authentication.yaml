title: Start the MongoDB instance with authentication enabled.
stepnum: 1
ref: start
pre: |
  Start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance with the
  :setting:`~security.authorization` or :setting:`~security.keyFile`
  setting. Use :setting:`~security.authorization` on a standalone
  instance. Use :setting:`~security.keyFile` on an instance in a
  :term:`replica set` or :term:`sharded cluster`.
action:
  - pre: |
      For example, to start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` with authentication
      enabled and a key file stored in ``/private/var``, first set the
      following option in the :binary:`~bin.mongod`'s configuration file:
    language: yaml
    code: |
      security:
        keyFile: /private/var/key.pem
  - pre: |
      Then start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` and specify the config file. For example:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongod --config /etc/mongodb/mongodb.conf
post: |
  After you enable authentication, only the user administrator can
  connect to the MongoDB instance. The user administrator must log in
  and grant further access to the instance by creating additional
  users.
---
title: Connect to the MongoDB instance via the localhost exception.
stepnum: 2
ref: connect-via-localhost
action:
  pre: |
    Connect to the MongoDB instance from a client running on the same
    system. This access is made possible by the :ref:`localhost exception
    <localhost-exception>`.
---
stepnum: 3
source:
  file: steps-add-user-administrator.yaml
  ref: create-site-user-admin
post: |
   After you create the user administrator, the
   :ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>` is no longer
   available.

   The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell executes a number of commands at start
   up. As a result, when you log in as the user administrator, you may
   see authentication errors from one or more commands. You may ignore
   these errors, which are expected, because the
   :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role does not have permissions to
   run some of the start up commands.
---
title: Create additional users.
stepnum: 4
ref: create-additonal-users
action:
  pre: |
    Login in with the user administrator's credentials and create
    additional users. See :doc:`/tutorial/add-user-to-database`.
