=================
Watch for Changes
=================

You can keep track of changes to data in MongoDB, such as changes to a
collection, database, or deployment, by opening a **change stream**. A change
stream allows applications to watch for changes to data and react to them.

The change stream returns **change event** documents when changes occur. A
change event contains information about the updated data.

Open a change stream by calling the ``watch()`` method on a
``MongoCollection``, ``MongoDatabase``, or ``MongoClient`` object as shown in
the following code example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/WatchUsageExampleTest.snippet.basic-watch.kt
   :language: kotlin

The ``watch()`` method optionally takes an **aggregation pipeline**  which
consists of an array of **stages** as the first parameter to filter and
transform the change event output as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/WatchUsageExampleTest.snippet.aggregates-watch.kt
   :language: kotlin

The ``watch()`` method returns an instance of ``ChangeStreamFlow``, a class
that offers several methods to access, organize, and traverse the results.
``ChangeStreamFlow`` also inherits methods from its parent class ``Flow``
from the Kotlin Coroutines library.

You can call ``collect()`` on the ``ChangeStreamFlow`` to handle
events as they occur. Alternatively, you can use other methods built in to ``Flow``
to work with the results.

To configure options for processing the documents returned from the change
stream, use member methods of the ``ChangeStreamFlow`` object returned
by ``watch()``. See the link to the ``ChangeStreamFlow`` API
documentation at the bottom of this example for more details on the
available methods.

Process Change Stream Events with .collect()
--------------------------------------------

To capture events from a change stream, call the ``collect()`` method
as shown below:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/WatchUsageExampleTest.snippet.collect-change-stream.kt
   :language: kotlin

The ``.collect()`` function triggers when a change event is emitted. You can
specify logic in the function to process the event document when it is
received.

.. note::

   For update operation change events, change streams only return the modified
   fields by default rather than the entire updated document. You can configure
   your change stream to also return the most current version of the document
   by calling the ``fullDocument()`` member method of the ``ChangeStreamFlow``
   object with the value ``FullDocument.UPDATE_LOOKUP`` as follows:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/WatchUsageExampleTest.snippet.full-document-changes.kt
      :language: kotlin

Example
-------

The following example application opens a change stream on the ``movies`` collection
in the ``sample_mflix`` database. The application use an aggregation pipeline
to filter changes based on  ``operationType`` so that it only receives insert and update
events. Deletes are excluded by omission. The application uses the ``.collect()`` method
to receive and print the filtered change events that occur on the collection.

The application launches the ``collect()`` operation in a separate coroutine job,
which allows the application to continue running while the change stream is open.
Once the operations are complete, the application closes the change stream and exits.
