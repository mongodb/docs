MongoDB has recently announced the MongoDB AI Applications Program (MAAP),
which aims to support customers in building AI-powered applications through
reference architectures, pre-built partner integrations, and professional
services. Additionally, the program includes a partnership with Accenture,
which will establish a center of excellence focused on MongoDB projects. These
initiatives demonstrate MongoDB's commitment to expanding its AI ecosystem and
its strategy to adapt its document-based architecture for the demands of
AI-driven application development.
