Use Short, Familiar Words and Phrases
=====================================

Use short, familiar words and phrases to convey an idea clearly. Such
words and phrases are:

- more conversational
- save space
- easier to scan
- often easier for non-native English speakers to understand

Use a longer word or phrase only if necessary to convey a particular
meaning.

If a word has variant spellings that are equally acceptable (such as
*canceled* and *cancelled*), use the shorter spelling.
