Development Series 3.1.x Reference
==================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB 3.2 is currently in development as part of the 3.1.x
development release series. 

.. warning::

   While 3.1.x releases are available, these versions of MONGODB are
   for **testing purposes only and not for production use**.

This reference document covers the 3.1 development series as a
work-in-progress. Features are subject to change. See also
:doc:`/release-notes/3.1-dev-series`.

.. |version-dev| replace:: 3.1.6

Aggregation Framework Enhancements
----------------------------------

New Stages
~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB |version-dev| introduces the following new stages for the
aggregation framework:

.. pipeline:: $sample

   Randomly select N documents from its input.

   The :pipeline:`$sample` stage has the following syntax: 

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $sample: { size: <positive integer> } }

   For example, the following aggregation operaton randomly selects
   ``5`` documents from the collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.datasets.aggregate(
         { $sample: { size: 5 } }
      )

   .. warning::

      - :pipeline:`$sample` may output the same document more than once
        in its result set. For more information, see
        :ref:`cursor-isolation`.

      - :pipeline:`$sample` as the first stage requires a collection
        scan.

New Accumulators for ``$group`` Stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB |version-dev| introduces the following new accumulators for the
aggregation framework:

.. group:: $stdDevSamp

   Calculates the sample standard deviation of the input values. Use if
   the values encompasses a sample of a population of data from which
   to generalize about the population. Use :group:`$stdDevPop` if the
   values represent the entire population of data or you do not wish to
   generalize about a larger population.

.. group:: $stdDevPop

   Calculates the population standard deviation of the input values.
   Use if the values encompasses the entire population of data you want
   to represent and do not wish to generalize about a larger
   population. Use :group:`$stdDevSamp` if the values represent only a
   sample of a population of data from which to generalize about the
   population.

New Arithmetic Expression Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB |version-dev| introduces the following new arithmetic operators for
the aggregation framework:

.. expression:: $sqrt

   Calculates the square root of a positive number and returns the
   result as a double.

   :expression:`$sqrt` has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $sqrt: <expression> }

   The argument can be any valid :ref:`expression
   <aggregation-expressions>` as long as it resolve to a *non-negative*
   number. For more information
   on expressions, see :ref:`aggregation-expressions`.

   If the argument resolves to a value of ``null`` or refers to a field
   that is missing, :expression:`$sqrt` returns ``null``. If the
   argument resolves to ``NaN``, :expression:`$sqrt` returns ``NaN``.

   :expression:`$sqrt` errors on negative numbers.

.. expression:: $abs 

   Returns the absolute value of a number.

   :expression:`$abs` has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $abs: [ <number> ] }

   The ``<number>`` expression can be any valid :ref:`expression
   <aggregation-expressions>` as long as it resolve to a number. For
   more information on expressions, see :ref:`aggregation-expressions`.

   If the argument resolves to a value of ``null`` or refers to a field
   that is missing, :expression:`$abs` returns ``null``. If the
   argument resolves to ``NaN``, :expression:`$abs` returns ``NaN``.

New Array Expression Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB |version-dev| introduces the following new array operators for the
aggregation framework:

.. expression:: $slice

   Returns a subset of an array.

   :expression:`$exp` has one of two syntax forms:

   The following syntax returns elements from either the start or end
   of the array:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $slice: [ <array>, <n> ] }

   The following syntax returns elements from the specified position in
   the array:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $slice: [ <array>, <position>, <n> ] }

   The ``<array>`` expression can be any valid :ref:`expression
   <aggregation-expressions>` as long as it resolves to an array.

   The optional ``<position>`` expression can be any valid
   :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` as long as it resolves
   to an integer.

   - If positive, :expression:`$slice` determines the starting position
     from the start of the array. If ``<position>`` is greater than the
     number of elements, the :expression:`$slice` returns an empty
     array.

   - If negative, :expression:`$slice` determines the starting position
     from the end of the array. If the absolute value of the
     ``<position>`` is greater than the number of elements, the
     starting position is the start of the array.

   The ``<n>`` expression can be any valid :ref:`expression
   <aggregation-expressions>` as long as it resolves to an integer. If
   ``<position>`` is specified, ``<n>`` must resolve to a positive
   integer.
   

   - If positive, :expression:`$slice` returns up to the first ``n``
     elements in the array. If the ``<position>`` is specified,
     :expression:`$slice` returns the first ``n`` elements starting
     from the position.

   - If negative, :expression:`$slice` returns up to the last ``n``
     elements in the array. ``n`` cannot resolve to a negative number
     *if* ``<position>`` is specified.

   For more information on expressions, see
   :ref:`aggregation-expressions`.

        - ``[ 1, 2 ]``

.. expression:: $arrayElemAt

   Returns the element at the specified array index.

   :expression:`$arrayElemAt` has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $arrayElemAt: [ <array>, <idx> ] }

   The ``<array>`` expression can be any valid :ref:`expression
   <aggregation-expressions>` as long as it resolve to an array.

   The ``<idx>`` expression can be any valid :ref:`expression
   <aggregation-expressions>` as long as it resolve to an integer.

   - If positive, :expression:`$arrayElemAt` returns the element at the
     ``idx`` position, counting from the start of the array.

   - If negative, :expression:`$arrayElemAt` returns the element at the
     ``idx`` position, counting from the end of the array.

   For more information on expressions, see
   :ref:`aggregation-expressions`.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 80 20

        - ``2``


      * - ``{ $arrayElemAt: [ [ 1, 2, 3 ], 15 ] }``

        - 

   If the ``idx`` exceeds the array bounds, :expression:`$arrayElemAt`
   does not return any result.

Bit Test Query Operators
------------------------

MongoDB |version-dev| introduces the four new bit test query operators.
The bit test query operators allow applications to test whether
particular bits are set or clear in bitpacked numerical fields or in
fields storing binary data.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

#. The operators can only test fields whose values are either number or
   BinData. Values of other types will not match.

#. If the value is a BSONType double, the value must be an integer,
   i.e. cannot have a fractional part, and must be representable as a
   64-bit signed integer, i.e. cannot be too big (2 :sup:`100`) or too
   small (-2\ :sup:`100`).

   If the double value meets the criteria, the operators convert the
   double to a 64-bit signed integer before applying the bit test.

#. Numbers are sign extended in order to handle bit positions beyond
   the 64 bits of a long. For example, we consider bit position ``200``
   set for the number ``-5`` but we consider bit position ``200`` clear
   for the number ``+5``.

Operators
~~~~~~~~~

.. query:: $bitsAllSet

   Selects documents where the all the specified bits of a field are
   set (i.e. ``1``).

   To use :query:`$bitsAllSet`, you can use one of
   the following syntaxes:

   - To use bit positions to specify which bits to test:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { <field>: { $bitsAllSet: [ <position>, <position2>, ... ] } }

     The ``<positions>`` can be any non-negative numerical BSON element
     type and must be representable as a 32-bit signed integer.

     The bit position is ``0``-based, starting at the least significant
     bit:

     .. code-block:: none

        11111111
        --------
        76543210 Position

     Consider a collection with the following documents:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { _id:1, a: 54, binaryValueofA: "00110110" }
        { _id:2, a: 20, binaryValueofA: "00010100" }

     The following query uses the :query:`$bitsAllSet` operator to test
     whether field ``a`` has bits set at position ``1`` and position
     ``5``, counting from the least significant bit as position ``0``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.collection.find( { a: { $bitsAllSet: [ 1, 5 ] } } )

     The query matches the following document:

     .. code-block:: javascript

     :query:`$bitsAllSet` uses the positions of the ``1``'s in the
     bitmask to test the bit in the corresponding position in the
     ``<field>``.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { <field>: { $bitsAllSet: <BinData> } }

     :query:`$bitsAllSet` uses the positions of the ``1``'s in the
     BinData to test the bit in the corresponding position in the
     ``<field>``. Bit position ``0`` is the first bit in the first byte
     of a BinData element.

     Consider a collection with the following documents:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { _id:1, a: 54, binaryValueofA: "00110110" }

        { _id:1, a: 54, binaryValueofA: "00110110" }
        { _id:2, a: 20, binaryValueofA: "00010100" }

.. query:: $bitsAnyClear

   Selects documents where at least one of the specified bits of a
   field are clear (i.e. ``0``). To use :query:`$bitsAnyClear`, you can
   use one of the following syntaxes:

   - To use bit positions to specify which bits to test:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { <field>: { $bitsAnyClear: [ <position>, <position2>, ... ] } }

     The ``<positions>`` can be any non-negative numerical BSON element
     type and must be representable as a 32-bit signed integer.

     The bit position is ``0``-based, starting at the least significant
     bit:

     .. code-block:: none

        11111111
        --------
        76543210 Position

     Consider a collection with the following documents:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { _id:1, a: 54, binaryValueofA: "00110110" }
        { _id:2, a: 20, binaryValueofA: "00010100" }

     The following query uses the :query:`$bitsAnyClear` operator to test
     whether field ``a`` has any bits cleared in position ``1`` and
     position ``5``, counting from the least significant bit as
     position ``0``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.collection.find( { a: { $bitsAnyClear: [ 1, 5 ] } } )

     The query matches the following document:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { _id:2, a: 20, binaryValueofA: "00010100" }

   - To use a numeric bitmask to specify which bits to test:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { <field>: { $bitsAnyClear: <numeric bitmask> } }

     :query:`$bitsAnyClear` uses the positions of the ``1``'s in the
     bitmask to test the bit in the corresponding position in the
     ``<field>``.

     The following query uses the :query:`$bitsAnyClear` operator to test
     whether field ``a`` has any bits cleared at positions that corresponds to
     positions of ``1``'s in the numeric bitmask ``50`` (i.e. ``00110010``).

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.collection.find( { a: { $bitsAnyClear: 50 } } )

     The query matches the following document:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { _id:2, a: 20, binaryValueofA: "00010100" }

   - To use BinData to specify which bits to test:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { <field>: { $bitsAnyClear: <BinData> } }

     :query:`$bitsAnyClear` uses the positions of the ``1``'s in the
     BinData to test the bit in the corresponding position in the
     ``<field>``.  Bit position ``0`` is the first bit in the first byte
     of a BinData element.

     The following query uses the :query:`$bitsAnyClear` operator to test
     whether field ``a`` has any bits cleared at positions that corresponds to
     positions of ``1``'s in the ``BinData(0, "MC==")`` (i.e. ``00110010``).

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.collection.find( { a: { $bitsAnyClear: BinData(0, "MC==") } } )

     The query matches the following document:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { _id:2, a: 20, binaryValueofA: "00010100" }

.. _3.2-ref-case-sensitive-text-search:

Case Sensitive Text Search Examples
-----------------------------------

The :query:`$text` operator adds support for case sensitive text search
of the Latin alphabet ``[A-z]`` with the new ``$caseSensitive`` option.

For more information on case sensitive text search, see
:ref:`3.2-case-sensitive-text-search`.

Case Sensitive Search for a Phrase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ``articles`` collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 4, "subject" : "café con leche" }
   { "_id" : 5, "subject" : "Café Con Leche" }
   { "_id" : 6, "subject" : "Café con leche" }

The following query performs a case sensitive search for the phrase
``Café Con Leche``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { 
      $text: { $search: "\"Café Con Leche\"", $language: "es", $caseSensitive: true }
   } )

The search matches just the document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 5, "subject" : "Café Con Leche" }

.. note::

   - For ``$caseSensitive: true``, the :query:`$text` operator performs
     an exact match on the phrase when filtering out documents.

   - Regardless of the ``$caseSensitive`` option, the :query:`$text`
     operator, as well as the :doc:`text index </core/index-text>`,
     treats the character with a diacritic ``é`` as distinct from ``É``.

Case Sensitivity with Negated Term
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *negated* term is a term that is prefixed by a minus sign ``-``. If
you negate a term, the :query:`$text` operator will exclude the
documents that contain those terms from the results. You can also
specify case sensitivity for negated terms.

The following example performs a case sensitive search for documents
that contain the words ``bake`` or ``coffee`` but do **not** contain
the term ``milk``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.articles.find( { $text: { $search: "bake coffee -milk", $caseSensitive: true } } )

The query matches the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 3, "subject" : "coffee and Milk" }

View Document Validation Information
------------------------------------

To view the validation specifications for a collection, you can use the
:method:`db.getCollectionInfos( )` method and the
:dbcommand:`listCollections` command.

If a collection includes :ref:`3.2-rel-notes-document-validation`
settings, the :dbcommand:`listCollections` command and the
:method:`db.getCollectionInfos()` method will include them in the
output for the collections.
