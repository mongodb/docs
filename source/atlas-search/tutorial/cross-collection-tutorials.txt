The following tutorials take you through the steps for querying across 
multiple collections:

- The :ref:`query-materialized-views` tutorial demonstrates 
  how to index and query on multiple collections using a combination of 
  On-Demand Materialized Views and :ref:`atlas-scheduled-triggers`.
- The :ref:`lookup-with-search-tutorial` tutorial demonstrates how to 
  perform cross-collection search by first joining collections in the 
  same database using :pipeline:`$lookup`, and then running a query in 
  the sub-pipeline using :pipeline:`$search`.
- The :ref:`search-with-unionwith-tutorial` tutorial demonstrates how 
  to search multiple collections using :pipeline:`$search` in the 
  :pipeline:`$unionWith` aggregation stage sub-pipeline.
