a. Create your Azure Key Vault and {+cmk-long+}

   To create a new {+azure-kv+} instance and {+cmk-long+},
   follow Microsoft's official
   `Set and retrieve a key from Azure Key Vault using the Azure portal <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/keys/quick-create-portal>`__
   Quick Start.

   .. important:: Record your Credentials
   
      Ensure you record the following credentials:

      - **Key Name**
      - **Key Identifier** (referred to as ``keyVaultEndpoint`` later in this guide)
      - **Key Version**

      You will need them to construct your ``dataKeyOpts`` object
      later in this tutorial.

#. Grant Permissions

   Grant your client application ``wrap`` and ``unwrap`` permissions
   to the key.
