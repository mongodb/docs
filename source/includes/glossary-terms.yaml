---
term: deduplication
ref: glossary-deduplication
definition: |

  A process that eliminates redundant data. This data can be additional
  copies of database or file system documents or redundant data within
  those documents at the block level when written to a storage medium
  like spinning or solid state disks. Only unique documents or blocks
  are written to a storage medium. This process usually applies to
  backups or data archiving.

  .. example::

     Each recipient in an email system may have their own copy of an
     email sent to the whole company. With deduplication, all copies of
     this except one are replaced with pointers to a single stored copy
     before backing up the email system. This effectively reduces the
     amount of storage capacity needed to back up this one email by 99
     percent.

---
term: deployment
ref: glossary-deployment
definition: |
