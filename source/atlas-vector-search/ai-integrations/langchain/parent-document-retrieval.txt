You can integrate {+avs+} with LangChain
to perform :ref:`parent document retrieval <parent-document-retrieval>`.
In this tutorial, you complete the following steps:

#. Set up the environment.
#. Prepare the data.
#. Instantiate the parent document retriever.
#. Create the {+avs+} index.
#. Use the retriever in a RAG pipeline.

.. _parent-document-retrieval:

Background
----------

**Parent document retrieval** is a retrieval technique that 
involves chunking large documents into smaller sub-documents.
In this technique, you query the smaller chunks before returning the full
parent document to the |llm|. This can improve 
the responses of your RAG agents and applications by allowing for more 
granular searches on smaller chunks while giving |llm|\s the full 
context of the parent document.

Parent document retrieval with MongoDB allows you to store both 
parent and child documents in a single collection, which 
supports efficient retrieval by only having to compute and index
the child documents' embeddings. 

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial, you must have the following:

.. include:: /includes/avs/shared/avs-python-openai-prerequisites.rst

Set Up the Environment
----------------------

.. include:: /includes/avs/shared/set-up-python-notebook-environment.rst

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/parent-document-set-up-environment.rst

Prepare the Data
----------------

Paste and run the following code in your notebook 
to load and chunk a sample PDF that contains a recent `MongoDB earnings report
<https://investors.mongodb.com/node/12881/pdf>`__.

This code uses a `text splitter <https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#text-splitters/>`__
to chunk the PDF data into smaller parent documents. It specifies the *chunk size*
(number of characters) and *chunk overlap* (number of overlapping characters 
between consecutive chunks) for each document.

Instantiate the Retriever
-------------------------

In this section, you instantiate the parent document retriever and use it to 
ingest data into |service|. 

``MongoDBAtlasParentDocumentRetriever`` chunks parent documents into smaller child documents, 
embeds the child documents, and then ingests both parent and child documents into the same 
collection in |service|. Under the hood, this retriever creates the following:

- An instance of ``MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch``, a vector store that handles vector search queries to the child documents.
- An instance of ``MongoDBDocStore``, a document store that handles storing and retrieving the parent documents.

Create the {+avs+} Index
------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/avs/facts/note-avs-index-required-access.rst

To enable vector search queries on the ``langchain_db.parent_document`` 
collection, you must create an {+avs+} index. You can 
use either the LangChain helper method or the
PyMongo driver method. Run the following code in your notebook for
your preferred method:

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: LangChain
      :tabid: langchain

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/create-index-langchain-parent-document.py
         :language: python
         :copyable:

      .. tip::

         `create_vector_search_index API reference <https://langchain-mongodb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/langchain_mongodb/index/langchain_mongodb.index.create_vector_search_index.html>`__

   .. tab:: PyMongo
      :tabid: pymongo

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/create-index-pymongo-parent-document.py
         :language: python
         :copyable:

.. include:: /includes/search-shared/fact-index-build-initial-sync.rst

Use the Retriever in Your RAG Pipeline
--------------------------------------

Once |service| builds your index, you can run vector search 
queries on your data and use the retriever in your RAG pipeline. 
Paste and run the following code in your notebook to implement 
a sample RAG pipeline that performs parent document retrieval:

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/parent-document-rag.rst
