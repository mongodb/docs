MongoDB supports creating indexes on a field or set of fields to 
support queries. Since MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, applications
can query against fields whose names cannot be known in advance or are
arbitrary. 

.. versionadded:: MongoDB 4.2 
   
   MongoDB 4.2 introduces wildcard indexes for supporting queries
   against unknown or arbitrary fields.

Create Wildcard Index
---------------------

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/wildcard-index-fcv.rst

You can create wildcard indexes using the 
:dbcommand:`createIndexes` database command or its shell helpers,
:method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` or 
:method:`~db.collection.createIndexes()`.

Create a Wildcard Index on a Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To index the value of a specific field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.createIndex( { "fieldA.$**" : 1 } )

With this wildcard index, MongoDB indexes all values of
``fieldA``. If the field is a nested document or array, the wildcard
index recurses into the document/array and stores the value for all 
fields in the document/array.

For example, documents in the ``product_catalog`` collection may contain
a  ``product_attributes`` field. The ``product_attributes`` field can
contain arbitrary nested fields, including embedded documents and
arrays:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "product_name" : "Spy Coat",
     "product_attributes" : {
       "material" : [ "Tweed", "Wool", "Leather" ]
       "size" : {
         "length" : 72,
         "units" : "inches"
       }
     } 
   }

   {
     "product_name" : "Spy Pen",
     "product_attributes" : {
        "colors" : [ "Blue", "Black" ],
        "secret_feature" : {
          "name" : "laser",
          "power" : "1000",
          "units" : "watts", 
        }
     }
   }

The following operation creates a wildcard index on the
``product_attributes`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products_catalog.createIndex( { "product_attributes.$**" : 1 } )

The wildcard index can support arbitrary single-field queries on
``product_attributes`` or its embedded fields:

.. code-block:: bash
   :copyable: false
 
   db.products_catalog.find( { "product_attributes.size.length" : { $gt : 60 } } )
   db.products_catalog.find( { "product_attributes.material" : "Leather" } )
   db.products_catalog.find( { "product_attributes.secret_feature.name" : "laser" } )

.. |projection-ref| replace:: :ref:`createIndex-method-wildcard-option`

.. note::

   The path-specific wildcard index syntax is incompatible with the
   ``wildcardProjection`` option. See the |projection-ref| for more
   information.

For an example, see :ref:`createIndex-method-wildcard-onepath`.

Create a Wildcard Index on All Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To index the value of all fields in a document
(excluding ``_id``), specify ``"$**"`` as the index key:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.createIndex( { "$**" : 1 } )

With this wildcard index, MongoDB indexes all fields for each document
in the collection. If a given field is a nested document or array, the
wildcard index recurses into the document/array and stores the value for
all fields in the document/array.

For an example, see :ref:`createIndex-method-wildcard-allpaths`.

.. note::

   Wildcard indexes omit the ``_id`` field by default. To include the
   ``_id`` field in the wildcard index, you must explicitly include it
   in the ``wildcardProjection`` document. See |projection-ref| for
   more information.

Create a Wildcard Index on Multiple Specific Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To index the values of multiple specific fields in a document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.createIndex(
     { "$**" : 1 },
     { "wildcardProjection" : 
       { "fieldA" : 1, "fieldB.fieldC" : 1 }
     }
   )

With this wildcard index, MongoDB indexes all values for the specified
fields for each document in the collection. If a given field is a nested
document or array, the wildcard index recurses into the document/array
and stores the value for all fields in the document/array. 

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/wildcard-index-inclusion-exclusion.rst

For an example, see :ref:`createIndex-method-wildcard-inclusion`.

Create a Wildcard Index that Excludes Multiple Specific Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To index the fields of all fields in a document
*excluding* specific field paths:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.createIndex(
     { "$**" : 1 },
     { "wildcardProjection" : 
       { "fieldA" : 0, "fieldB.fieldC" : 0 }
     }
   )

With this wildcard index, MongoDB indexes all fields for each 
document in the collection *excluding* the specified field paths. If a
given field is a nested document or array, the wildcard index recurses
into the document/array and stores the values for all fields in the
document/array.

For an example, see :ref:`createIndex-method-wildcard-exclusion`.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/wildcard-index-inclusion-exclusion.rst

Considerations
--------------

- Wildcard indexes can support at most *one* field in any given query 
  predicate. For more information on wildcard index query
  support, see :ref:`wildcard-index-query-sort-support`.

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/wildcard-index-fcv.rst

- Wildcard indexes omit the _id field by default. To include the ``_id``
  field in the wildcard index, you must explicitly include it in the
  wildcardProjection document (i.e. ``{ "_id" : 1 }``).

- You can create multiple wildcard indexes in a collection.

- A wildcard index may cover the same fields as other indexes in the 
  collection.

- Wildcard indexes are :doc:`/core/index-sparse` and only contain 
  entries for documents that have the indexed field, even if the index 
  field contains a null value.

Behavior
--------

Wildcard indexes have specific behavior when indexing fields which
are an object (i.e. an embedded document) or an array:

- If the field is an object, the wildcard index descends into
  the object and indexes its contents. The wildcard index continues
  descending into any additional embedded documents it encounters.

- If the field is an array, then the wildcard index traverses the array
  and indexes each element:

  - If an element in the array is an object, the wildcard index
    descends into the object to index its contents as described above.
    
  - If the element is an array - that is, an array which is embedded
    directly within the parent array - then the wildcard index does
    *not* traverse the embedded array, but indexes the *entire* array
    as a single value.

- For all other fields, record the primitive (non-object/array) value
  into the index.

The wildcard index continues traversing any additional nested objects or
arrays until it reaches a primitive value (i.e. a field that is not an
object or array). It then indexes this primitive value, along with the
full path to that field.

For example, consider the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "parentField" : {
       "nestedField" : "nestedValue",
       "nestedObject" : {
         "deeplyNestedField" : "deeplyNestedValue" 
       },
       "nestedArray" : [
         "nestedArrayElementOne",
         [ "nestedArrayElementTwo" ]
       ]
     }
   }

A wildcard index which includes ``parentField`` records the following
entries:

- ``"parentField.nestedField" : "nestedValue"``
- ``"parentField.nestedObject.deeplyNestedField" : "deeplyNestedValue"``
- ``"parentField.nestedArray" : "nestedArrayElementOne"``
- ``"parentField.nestedArray" : ["nestedArrayElementTwo"]``

Note that the records for ``parentField.nestedArray`` do not include the
array position for each element. Wildcard indexes ignore array element
positions when recording the element into the index. Wildcard indexes
can still support queries that include explicit array indices. See
:ref:`wildcard-query-support-explicit-array-indices` for more
information.

For more information on wildcard index behavior with nested objects,
see :ref:`wildcard-index-nested-objects`. 

For more information on wildcard index behavior with nested arrays,
see :ref:`wildcard-index-nested-arrays`.

.. _wildcard-index-nested-objects:

Nested Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a wildcard index encounters a nested object, it descends into
the object and indexes its contents. For example:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "parentField" : {
       "nestedField" : "nestedValue",
       "nestedArray" : ["nestedElement"]
       "nestedObject" : {
         "deeplyNestedField" : "deeplyNestedValue"
       }
     }
   }

A wildcard index which includes ``parentField`` descends into the
object to traverse and index its contents:

- For each field which is itself an object (i.e. an embedded document),
  descend into the object to index its contents. 

- For each field which is an array, traverse the array and index 
  its contents.

- For all other fields, record the primitive (non-object/array) value
  into the index.

The wildcard index continues traversing any additional nested objects or
arrays until it reaches a primitive value (i.e. a field that is not an
object or array). It then indexes this primitive value, along with the
full path to that field.

Given the sample document, the wildcard index adds the following records
to the index:

- ``"parentField.nestedField" : "nestedValue"`` 
- ``"parentField.nestedObject.deeplyNestedField" : "deeplyNestedValue"``
- ``"parentField.nestedArray" : "nestedElement"``

For more information on wildcard index behavior with nested arrays,
see :ref:`wildcard-index-nested-arrays`.

.. _wildcard-index-nested-arrays:

Nested Arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a wildcard index encounters a nested array, it attempts to traverse
the array to index its elements. If the array is itself an element in a
parent array (i.e. an embedded array), the wildcard index instead
records the entire array as a value instead of traversing its contents.
For example:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "parentArray" : [
       "arrayElementOne",
       [ "embeddedArrayElement" ],
       "nestedObject" : {
         "nestedArray" : [
           "nestedArrayElementOne",
           "nestedArrayElementTwo"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }

A wildcard index which includes ``parentArray`` descends into the
array to traverse and index its contents:

- For each element which is an array (i.e. an embedded array), 
  index the *entire* array as a value.

- For each element which is an object, descend into the object to 
  traverse and index its contents. 

- For all other fields, record the primitive (non-object/array) value
  into the index.

The wildcard index continues traversing any additional nested objects or
arrays until it reaches a primitive value (i.e. a field that is not an
object or array). It then indexes this primitive value, along with the
full path to that field.

Given the sample document, the wildcard index adds the following records
to the index:

- ``"parentArray" : "arrayElementOne"`` 
- ``"parentArray" : ["embeddedArrayElement"]``
- ``"parentArray.nestedObject.nestedArray" : "nestedArrayElementOne"``
- ``"parentArray.nestedObject.nestedArray" : "nestedArrayElementTwo"``

Note that the records for ``parentField.nestedArray`` do not include the
array position for each element. Wildcard indexes ignore array element
positions when recording the element into the index. Wildcard indexes
can still support queries that include explicit array indices. See
:ref:`wildcard-query-support-explicit-array-indices` for more
information.

Restrictions
------------

- You cannot shard a collection using a wildcard index. Create a
  non-wildcard index on the field or fields you want to shard on.
  For more information on shard key selection, see
  :ref:`sharding-shard-key`.

- You cannot create a :doc:`compound </core/index-compound>` index.

- You cannot specify the following properties for a wildcard index:

  - :doc:`TTL </core/index-ttl>`
  - :doc:`Unique </core/index-unique>`

- You cannot create the following index types using wildcard syntax:

  - :doc:`2d (Geospatial) </core/geospatial-indexes>`
  - :doc:`2dsphere (Geospatial) </core/2dsphere>`
  - :doc:`Hashed </core/index-hashed>`

.. important::

   Wildcard Indexes are distinct from and incompatible with
   :ref:`text-index-wildcard`. Wildcard indexes cannot support
   queries using the :query:`$text` operator. 

For complete documentation on wildcard index creation restrictions, see 
:ref:`wildcard-index-restrictions-create`.

.. _wildcard-index-query-sort-support:

Wildcard Index Query/Sort Support
---------------------------------

Covered Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wildcard indexes can support a :ref:`covered query <covered-queries>` 
**only if** all of the following are true:

- The query planner selects the wildcard index for satisfying the
  query predicate.

- The query predicate specifies *exactly* one field covered by the wildcard
  index.

- The projection explicitly excludes ``_id`` and includes *only* the query
  field.

- The specified query field is never an array.

Consider the following wildcard index on the ``employees`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.createIndex( { "$**" : 1 } )

The following operation queries for a single field 
``lastName`` and projects out all other fields from the
resulting document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.find(
     { "lastName" : "Doe" },
     { "_id" : 0, "lastName" : 1 }
   )

Assuming that the specified ``lastName`` is never an array, MongoDB
can use the ``$**`` wildcard index for supporting a covered query.

Multi-Field Query Predicates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wildcard indexes can support at most *one* query predicate field. That 
is:

- MongoDB cannot use a non-wildcard index to satisfy one part of a 
  query predicate and a wildcard index to satisfy another.

- MongoDB cannot use one wildcard index to satisfy one part of a query 
  predicate and another wildcard index to satisfy another.

- Even if a single wildcard index could support multiple query fields, 
  MongoDB can use the wildcard index to support only one of the query 
  fields. All remaining fields are resolved without an index.

However, MongoDB may use the same wildcard index for satisfying each 
independent argument of the query :query:`$or` or aggregation 
:expression:`$or` operators.

Queries with Sort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB can use a wildcard index for satisfying the 
:method:`~cursor.sort()` **only if** all of the following are true:

- The query planner selects the wildcard index for satisfying the
  query predicate.

- The :method:`~cursor.sort()` specifies **only** the query predicate
  field.

- The specified field is never an array.

If the above conditions are not met, MongoDB cannot use the wildcard 
index for the sort. MongoDB does not support :method:`~cursor.sort`
operations that require a different index from that of the query
predicate. For more information, see :ref:`index-intersection-sort`.

Consider the following wildcard index on the ``products`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.createIndex( { "product_attributes.$**" : 1 } )

The following operation queries for a single field 
``product_attributes.price`` and sorts on that same field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.find(
     { "product_attributes.price" : { $gt : 10.00 } },
   ).sort(
     { "product_attributes.price" : 1 }
   )

Assuming that the specified ``price`` is never an array, MongoDB
can use the ``product_attributes.$**`` wildcard index for satisfying 
both the :method:`~db.collection.find()` and :method:`~cursor.sort()`.

Unsupported Query Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wildcard indexes **cannot** support the following query patterns:

- Queries that check if a field does not exist

- Queries that check if a field is or is not equal to a document or an
  array

- Queries that check if a field is equal to null

For details, see :ref:`wildcard-index-restrictions-query-aggregation`.

.. _wildcard-query-support-explicit-array-indices:

Queries with Explicit Array Indices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB wildcard indexes do not record the array position of any given
element in an array during indexing. However, MongoDB may still select
the wildcard index to answer a query which includes a field path with
one or more explicit array indices (for example,
``parentArray.0.nestedArray.0``). Due to the increasing complexity of
defining index bounds for each consecutive nested array, MongoDB does
not consider the wildcard index to answer a given field path in the
query if that path contains more than ``8`` explicit array indices.
MongoDB can still consider the wildcard index to answer other field
paths in the query.

For example:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "parentObject" : {
       "nestedArray" : [ 
          "elementOne",
          {
            "deeplyNestedArray" : [ "elementTwo" ]
          }
        ]
     }
   }

MongoDB can select a wildcard index which includes ``parentObject`` to
satisfy the following queries:

- ``"parentObject.nestedArray.0" : "elementOne"``
- ``"parentObject.nestedArray.1.deeplyNestedArray.0" : "elementTwo"``

If a given field path in the query predicate specifies more than 8
explicit array indices, MongoDB does not consider the wildcard index for
answering that field path. MongoDB instead either selects another
eligible index to answer the query, *or* performs a collection scan.

Note that wildcard indexes themselves do not have any limits on the
depth to which they traverse a document while indexing it; the
limitation only applies to queries which explicitly specify exact array
indices. By issuing the same queries without the explicit array indices,
MongoDB may select the wildcard index to answer the query:

- ``"parentObject.nestedArray" : "elementOne"``
- ``"parentObject.nestedArray.deeplyNestedArray" : "elementTwo"``
