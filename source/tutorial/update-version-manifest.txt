You can use Automation to install and upgrade MongoDB instances in your
deployment. You need to give |onprem| a list of which versions can be
installed. The complete list of all possible MongoDB editions and
versions is called the :opsmgr:`version manifest </reference/glossary/#std-term-version-manifest>`.

If you set the :guilabel:`Ops Manager gets installers from:` option to ``Direct connection to MongoDB``, |onprem| updates the version manifest automatically.

If you set the :guilabel:`Ops Manager gets installers from:` option to ``Ops Manager Application Server Hard Drive``, you need to update the  :opsmgr:`version manifest </reference/glossary/#std-term-version-manifest>` manually.
