.. note::

   Starting with MongoDB 4.4.1,
   :ref:`installing the MongoDB Server via Homebrew
   <install-with-homebrew>` also installs the {+dbtools-short+}. The
   following command will determine if the {+dbtools-short+} are already
   installed on your system:

   .. code-block:: shell

      brew list | grep {+dbtools-pkg+}
