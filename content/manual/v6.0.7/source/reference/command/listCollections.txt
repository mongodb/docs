.. dbcommand:: listCollections

   Retrieve information, i.e. the name and options, about the
   collections and :doc:`views </core/views>` in a database. Specifically, the command returns a
   document that contains information with which to create a
   cursor to the collection information. :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
   provides the :method:`db.getCollectionInfos()` and the
   :method:`db.getCollectionNames()` helper methods.

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      { 
        listCollections: 1, 
        filter: <document>, 
        nameOnly: <boolean>, 
        authorizedCollections: <boolean>, 
        comment: <any> 
      }
   )

Command Fields
--------------

The command can take the following optional fields:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 20 20 80

  * - Field
    - Type
    - Description

  * - ``filter``
    - document
    - Optional. A query expression to filter the list of collections.
      
      You can specify a query expression on any of the :ref:`fields
      returned <list-collection-output>` by :dbcommand:`listCollections`.

  * - ``nameOnly``
    - boolean
    - Optional. A flag to indicate whether the command should return just the
      collection/view names and type or return both the name and other information.
      
      Returning just the name and type (``view`` or ``collection``) does
      not take collection-level locks whereas returning full collection
      information locks each collection in the database.
      
      The default value is ``false``.
      
      .. note::
      
         When ``nameOnly`` is ``true``, your ``filter`` expression can only
         filter based on a collection's name and type. No other fields are
         available.
      
  * - ``authorizedCollections``
    - boolean
    - Optional. A flag, when set to ``true`` and used with ``nameOnly: true``, that
      allows a user without the required privilege (i.e.
      :authaction:`listCollections` action on the database) to run the
      command when access control is enforced.
      
      When both ``authorizedCollections`` and ``nameOnly`` options are set
      to true, the command returns only those collections for which the user
      has privileges. For example, if a user has :authaction:`find` action
      on specific collections, the command returns only those collections; or,
      if a user has :authaction:`find` or any other action, on the
      database resource, the command lists all collections in the database.
      
      The default value is ``false``. That is, the user must have
      :authaction:`listCollections` action on the database to run the
      command.
      
      For a user who has :authaction:`listCollections` action on the
      database, this option has no effect since the user has privileges to
      list the collections in the database.
      
      When used without ``nameOnly: true``, this option has no effect.
      That is, the user must have the required privileges to run the
      command when access control is enforced. Otherwise, the user is
      unauthorized to run the command.
      
  * - ``comment``
    - any

.. _listCollections-behavior:

Behavior
--------

Filter
~~~~~~

Use a filter to limit the results of :dbcommand:`listCollections`. You
can specify a ``filter`` on any of the :ref:`fields returned
<list-collection-output>` in the :dbcommand:`listCollections` result
set.

Locks
~~~~~

The :dbcommand:`listCollections` command takes Intent Shared lock on the
database. In previous versions, the command takes Shared lock on the
database.

Unless the ``nameOnly`` option is specified, the command also takes an
Intent Shared lock on each of the collections in turn while holding the
Intent Shared lock on the database.

.. _list-collection-output:

Output
------

.. data:: listCollections.cursor

   A document that contains information with which to create a cursor
   to documents that contain collection names and options. The cursor
   information includes the cursor id, the full namespace for the
   command, as well as the first batch of results. Each document in the
   batch output contains the following fields:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 15 30

      * - Field
        - Type
        - Description

      * - name
        - String
        - Name of the collection.

      * - type
        - String
        - Type of data store. Returns ``collection`` for
          :manual:`collections
          </core/databases-and-collections/#collections>`, ``view`` for
          :manual:`views </core/views/>`, and ``timeseries`` for
          :ref:`time series collection <manual-timeseries-collection>`.

      * - options
        - Document
        - Collection options.

          These options correspond directly to the options available in
          :method:`db.createCollection()`. For the descriptions on the
          options, see :method:`db.createCollection()`.

      * - info
        - Document
        - Lists the following fields related to the collection:

          readOnly
             ``boolean``. If ``true`` the data store is read only.

          uuid
             :abbr:`UUID (Universally unique identifier)`. Once
             established, the collection UUID does not change. The
             collection UUID remains the same across replica set
             members and shards in a sharded cluster.

      * - idIndex
        - Document
        - Provides information on the ``_id`` index for the
          collection.

.. data:: listCollections.ok

   The return value for the command. A value of ``1`` indicates
   success.



Example
-------

List All Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the :method:`db.getCollectionInfos()` helper
to return information for all collections in the ``records`` database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use records
   db.getCollectionInfos();

.. seealso::

   :method:`db.getCollectionInfos()`
