.. expression:: term

   The ``term`` operator specifies an unanalyzed search. The engine
   searches for the query terms exactly as they are indexed, with no
   :ref:`analyzer <analyzers-ref>` modifications at query time. Any
   analyzer which was used during the index creation still applies to
   the index, but the search itself does not use an analyzer.

   .. note:: 

      The ``term`` operator normalizes the query terms in the same way they 
      are normalized in the index. That is, when you use it with the 
      :ref:`ref-standard-analyzer`, the operator converts your query terms 
      to lower case. When you use it with the :ref:`ref-keyword-analyzer`, 
      the ``term`` operator performs an exact match on the field.
   
   ``term`` has the following syntax:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      { 
        $search: {  
          "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
          "term": {
            "query": "<search-term>",
            "path": "<field-to-search>",
            "wildcard": <boolean>,
            "regex": <boolean>,
            "prefix": <boolean>,
            "fuzzy": { "maxEdits": <integer>, "prefixLength": <integer> },
            "score": <options>
          }
        }
      }

   .. important::
  
      The ``wildcard``, ``regex``, ``prefix`` and ``fuzzy`` options
      cannot be used in combination with each other.

Examples
--------

The following examples use a collection called ``fruit`` which contains
the following documents:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

   {
     "_id" : 1,
     "type" : "apple",
     "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp."
   },
   {
     "_id" : 2,
     "type" : "banana",
     "description" : "Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six."
   }

The ``fruit`` collection has an |fts| index on the ``description``
field which uses the :ref:`standard <ref-standard-analyzer>` analyzer.
The ``standard`` analyzer lower-cases all words and disregards common
stop words (``"the", "a", "and",`` etc).

Basic Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following |fts| example performs a basic search of the
``description`` field for the query term ``several``, using the
``term`` operator.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "term": {
           "query": "several",
           "path": "description"
         }
       }
     }
   ])

The above query returns the document with ``_id: 1``, which has the
word ``several`` in the ``description`` field.

The following example performs a basic search of the ``description`` 
field for the query term ``Smith``. The ``standard`` analyzer,
which was used to create the index lower-cases all tokens, and the
``term`` operator also converts the query term to lower case.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "term": {
           "query": "Smith",
           "path": "description"
         }
       }
     }
   ])

The above query returns the document with ``_id: 1``, which has the
word ``Smith`` in the ``description`` field.

Fuzzy Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``fuzzy`` option to search for strings which are
similar to a term or terms which you specify.

The following query searches for strings which are within one
character of the strings ``fuj`` and ``bannas``.

- ``maxEdits`` field specifies that only one character change is
  allowed to match the query to the document.

- ``prefixLength`` field specifies that the first two characters
  of the query term may not be changed to match a result.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   db.fruit.aggregate([
     {
       $search: {
         "term": {
           "path": "description",
           "query": ["fuj", "bannas"],
           "fuzzy": { "maxEdits": 1, "prefixLength": 2 }
         }
       }
     },
     {
       $project: {
          "_id": 0,
          "description": 1
       }
     }
   ])

The above query finds both of the documents in the collection. The
``$project`` stage limits the output to the ``description`` field.

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     "description" : "Bananas are usually sold in bunches of five or six."
   },
   {
     "description" : "Apples come in several varieties, including Fuji, Granny Smith, and Honeycrisp."
   }
