This document explains the internals of :ref:`2d indexes <2d-index>`.
This material is not necessary for normal operations or application
development, but may be useful for troubleshooting and for further
understanding.

Geohash Values
--------------

When you create a geospatial index on a field that contains
:term:`legacy coordinate pairs <legacy coordinate pairs>`, MongoDB
computes :term:`geohash` values for the coordinate pairs within the
specified :ref:`location range <2d-index-define-location-range>`, then
indexes the geohash values.

To calculate a geohash value, MongoDB recursively divides a
two-dimensional map into quadrants. Then, it assigns each quadrant a
two-bit value. For example, a two-bit representation of four quadrants
would be:

.. code-block:: javascript

   01  11

   00  10

These two-bit values (``00``, ``01``, ``10``, and ``11``) represent each
of the quadrants and all points within each quadrant. Each quadrant has
a corresponding geohash value:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 10

   * - Quadrant
     - Geohash

   * - Bottom-left
     - ``00``

   * - Top-left
     - ``01``

   * - Bottom-right
     - ``10``

   * - Top-right
     - ``11``

To provide additional precision, MongoDB can divide each quadrant into
sub-quadrants. Each sub-quadrant has the geohash value of the containing
quadrant concatenated with the value of the sub-quadrant. For example,
the geohash for the top-right quadrant is ``11``, and the geohash for
the sub-quadrants would be (clockwise from the top left):

- ``1101``
- ``1111``
- ``1110``
- ``1100``

.. Commented out -- per Jesse's feedback, users don't control this. To
   calculate a more precise geohash, continue dividing the sub-quadrant
   and concatenate the two-bit identifier for each division. The more
   "bits" in the hash identifier for a given point, the smaller possible
   area that the hash can describe and the higher the resolution of the
   geospatial index.

Multi-Location Documents for 2d Indexes
---------------------------------------

While 2d indexes do not support more than one location field in a
document, you can use a :ref:`multi-key index <index-type-multi-key>` to
index multiple coordinate pairs in a single document. For example, in
the following document, the ``locs`` field holds an array of coordinate
pairs:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.insertOne( {
      locs : [
         [ 55.5 , 42.3 ],
         [ -74 , 44.74 ],
         { long : 55.5 , lat : 42.3 }
      ]
   } )

The values in the ``locs`` array may be either:

- Arrays, as in ``[ 55.5, 42.3 ]``.

- Embedded documents, as in ``{ long : 55.5 , lat : 42.3 }``.

To index all of the coordinate pairs in the ``locs`` array, create a 2d
index on the ``locs`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.createIndex( { "locs": "2d" } )

Embedded Multi-Location Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can store location data as a field inside of an embedded document.
For example, you can have an array of embedded documents where each
embedded document has a field that contains location data.

In the following document, the ``addresses`` field is an array of
embedded documents. The embedded documents contain a ``loc`` field,
which is a coordinate pair:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.insertOne( {
      name : "John Smith",
      addresses : [
         {
            context : "home" ,
            loc : [ 55.5, 42.3 ]
         },
         {
            context : "work",
            loc : [ -74 , 44.74 ]
         }
      ]
   } )

To index all of the ``loc`` values in the ``addresses`` array, create a
2d index on the ``addresses.loc`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.createIndex( { "addresses.loc": "2d" } )
