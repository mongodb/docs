{+service+} Features and Recommendations for Scalability
---------------------------------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~~

Auto-scaling enables clusters to automatically adjust their tier, storage capacity, or both, in 
response to real-time use. {+service+} analyzes the CPU and memory utilization to determine when 
and whether to scale the cluster tier up and down. See :ref:`Cluster tier scaling <cluster-autoscaling>` 
to learn more about the conditions under which {+service+} scales up or down your cluster nodes. You can 
also specify a range of maximum and minimum cluster sizes that your cluster can automatically scale 
to. {+service+} won't scale a cluster if the new tier falls outside of your specified size range or 
if your memory usage would exceed the capacity of the new tier. Auto-scaling is throttled with a delay 
to scale a cluster tier up or down. Therefore, it is best suited for a steadily growing or declining 
application load, not sudden spikes in which the database is being inundated with usage. If your 
workload experiences frequent spikes or if you are expecting a large increase in traffic because of an 
event or a launch, MongoDB recommends that you pre-scale programmatically. 

{+service+} deployment templates, as referenced in the :ref:`Recommended Deployment Topologies <arch-center-deployment-topologies>`, 
provide you with horizontal and vertical scaling options. Specifically, sharding distributes data across 
numerous machines, which is useful when no single server can handle your workloads. Sharding follows a 
shared-nothing architecture, a distributed computing architecture where none of the nodes share any 
resources with each other. See :ref:`Choose a Shard Key <sharding-choose-a-shard-key>` to learn more 
about the ideal choice of shard key that allows MongoDB to distribute documents evenly throughout your cluster 
while faciliating common query patterns. Furthermore, see `Performance Best Practices: Sharding <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/performance-best-practices-sharding>`__ 
to learn about the key sharding strategies, such as ranged sharding, hashed sharding, and zoned sharding.

Upgrading an {+service+} cluster to the next available {+service+} tier is available through the 
{+service+} control plane GUI or the 
`Atlas Administration API <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Clusters/operation/upgradeSharedCluster>`__. 
Changing an {+service+} tier, either upscaling or downscaling, allows zero downtime, and is performed 
in a rolling fashion, which involves electing a secondary member as a replacement, promoting this secondary 
member to become the new primary, then restoring or replacing the failing member 
to ensure that the cluster is returned to its target configuration as soon as possible. Horizontal 
scaling occurs post-deployment based on Administrator action, which can be triggered from a programmatic 
script. Some cluster templates require sharded clusters. Starting with MongoDB version 8.0, you may make 
use of :manual:`embedded config servers </reference/command/transitionFromDedicatedConfigServer>` to reduce 
costs associated with config servers on small sharded clusters. 

The low CPU option in {+service+} helps applications that require higher memory but not as much 
processing power. This option provides instances with half the vCPUs compared to the General tier of 
the same cluster size, reducing costs for workloads that are memory-intensive but not CPU-bound. 

Data tiering and archival allows you to archive data at low-cost storage while still enabling 
queries alongside live cluster data, which is particularly useful for long-term record retention. 
To optimize this process, MongoDB recommends that you automate data archiving with simple, configurable 
rules. See :ref:`Archive Data <manage-online-archive>` to learn more about the criteria that you can specify 
in an archiving rule. For scenarios where data retention is not a priority, {+service+} offers the option to 
automatically delete unused data based on date criteria. For infrequently accessed data, :manual:`TTL indexes <core/index-ttl/>` 
are special single-field indexes that automatically delete documents from a collection after a specified 
period or at a set clock time. This is particularly useful for data like logs, session information, 
or event data that only needs to be retained for a limited time. To create a TTL index, you can define 
an index on a field that holds date values and specify a time-to-live duration in seconds.

{+service+} also provides you with automated tools, such as the :opsmgr:`Performance Advisor </current/tutorial/performance-advisor/>`, 
to monitor and identify inefficient queries such as adding or removing an index or 
changing your client's query structure. You can reduce unnecessary compute time and resource 
consumption by following actionable recommendations to enhance your query performance. Additionally, 
you can leverage intelligent index recommendations provided by {+service+} to further improve data 
retrieval efficiency and minimize the resources needed for database operations. 

Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For development and testing environments, do not enable auto-scaling
compute and auto-scaling storage. This saves costs in your 
non-production environments.

For staging and production environments, we recommend that you:

- Enable auto-scaling for compute and storage for instances where your 
  application grows organically from small to medium.
  
  If you use IaC tools, leverage settings to ignore resource drift caused by auto-scaling. For example, in Terraform, if ``disk_gb_enabled`` is true, |service| will 
  automatically scale disk size up and down. This will cause the value
  of ``disk_size_gb`` returned to potentially be different than what is 
  specified in the Terraform config and if one then applies a plan, not 
  noting this, Terraform will scale the cluster disk size back to the 
  original ``disk_size_gb`` value. To prevent this a lifecycle 
  customization should be used, i.e.: 
  ``lifecycle { ignore_changes = [disk_size_gb] }``.

  Similarly, in Terraform, if ``compute_enabled`` is true, then 
  |service| will automatically 
  scale up to the maximum provided and down to the minimum, if provided. This will 
  cause the value of ``provider_instance_size_name`` returned to potentially be different 
  than what is specified in the Terraform config, and if one then applies a plan, 
  not noting this, Terraform will scale the cluster back to the original 
  ``instanceSizeName`` value. To prevent this a lifecycle customization should be used, 
  i.e.: ``lifecycle { ignore_changes = [provider_instance_size_name] }``.

         Before you
         can create resources with the {+atlas-cli+}, you must:

         - :atlas:`Create your paying organization 
           </billing/#configure-a-paying-organization>` and :atlas:`create an API key </configure-api-access/>` for the
           paying organization.

         - :atlascli:`Connect from the {+atlas-cli+} 
           </connect-atlas-cli/>` using the steps for :guilabel:`Programmatic Use`.

      Create One Deployment Per Project
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Dev and Test Environments
            :tabid: devtest

            For your development and testing environments, auto-scaling compute and storage is disabled to save costs.

         .. tab:: Staging and Prod Environments
            :tabid: stagingprod

            For your staging and production environments, create the following ``cluster.json`` file for each project. 
            Change the IDs and names to use your values:

            .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-json-example-create-clusters-with-autoscaling.rst

            After you create the ``cluster.json`` file, run the
            following command for each project. The
            command uses the ``cluster.json`` file to create a cluster.

            .. include:: /includes/examples/cli-example-create-clusters-stagingprod.rst 

      For more configuration options and info about this example, 
      see :ref:`atlas-clusters-create`.

   .. tab:: Terraform
      :tabid: Terraform

      .. note::

         Before you
         can create resources with Terraform, you must:

         - :atlas:`Create your paying organization 
           </billing/#configure-a-paying-organization>` and :atlas:`create an API key </configure-api-access/>` for the
           paying organization. Store your API key as environment
           variables by running the following command in the terminal:

           .. code-block::

              export MONGODB_ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY="<insert your public key here>"
              export MONGODB_ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY="<insert your private key here>"

      Create the Projects and Deployments
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Dev and Test Environments
            :tabid: devtest

            For your development and testing environments, auto-scaling compute and storage is disabled to save costs.

         .. tab:: Staging and Prod Environments
            :tabid: stagingprod

            For your staging and production environments, create the
            following files for each application and environment 
            pair. Place the files for each application and environment
            pair in their own directory. Change the IDs, names, and disk size
            to use your values.

            main.tf
            ```````

            .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-main-stagingprod.rst 

            variables.tf
            ````````````

            .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-autoscaling-variables.rst

            terraform.tfvars
            ````````````````

            .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-tfvars-autoscaling-stagingprod.rst

            provider.tf
            ```````````

            .. include:: /includes/examples/tf-example-provider.rst

            After you create the files, navigate to each application and environment pair's directory and run the following
            command to initialize Terraform:

            .. code-block::

               terraform init

            Run the following command to view the Terraform plan:

            .. code-block::

               terraform plan
            
            After adding the ``lifecycle`` block to explicitly change ``disk_size_gb`` and 
            ``instant_size``, comment out the ``lifecycle`` block and run ``terraform apply``. 
            Please be sure to uncomment the ``lifecycle`` block once done to prevent any accidental 
            changes.

            Run the following command to create one project and one deployment for the application and environment pair. The command uses the files and the |service-terraform| to
            create the projects and clusters:

            .. code-block::

               terraform apply

            When prompted, type ``yes`` and press :kbd:`Enter` to apply
            the configuration. 
      
      For more configuration options and info about this example, 
      see |service-terraform| and the `MongoDB Terraform Blog Post
      <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/deploy-mongodb-atlas-terraform-aws/>`__.
