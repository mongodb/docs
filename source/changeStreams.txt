Change streams allow applications to access real-time data changes
without the complexity and risk of tailing the :term:`oplog`.
Applications can use change streams to subscribe to all data changes on
a collection and immediately react to them.

.. important::

   Change stream is only available if :readconcern:`"majority"` read
   concern support is enabled (default).

Open A Change Stream
--------------------

You can only open a change stream against :doc:`replica sets
<replication>` or :doc:`sharded clusters </sharding>`. For a sharded
cluster, you must issue the open change stream operation against the
:binary:`~bin.mongos`.

The replica set or the sharded cluster must use replica set protocol
version 1 (:rsconf:`pv1 <protocolVersion>`) and :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>` storage engine (can be :ref:`encrypted
<encrypted-storage-engine>`).

The following example opens a change stream for a collection and
iterates over the cursor to retrieve the change stream documents.
While the connection to the MongoDB deployment remains
open, the cursor remains open until one of the following occurs:

- The cursor is explicitly closed.

- An :ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>` occurs.

Lookup Full Document for Update Operations

By default, change streams only return the delta of fields during the
update operation. However, you can configure the change stream to
return the most current majority-committed version of the updated
document.

   that change stream event.

   stream response document format.

Resume a Change Stream
----------------------


Change streams are resumable by specifying a ``resumeAfter`` token when
opening the cursor. For the ``resumeAfter`` token, use the ``_id``
value of the :ref:`change stream event document
<change-stream-output>`. Passing the ``_id`` value to the change stream
attempts to resume notifications starting after the  specified operation.

.. important::

   - The oplog must have enough history to locate the operation
     associated with the token or the timestamp, if the timestamp is in
     the past.

Use Cases
---------

Change streams can benefit architectures with reliant business systems,
informing downstream systems once data changes are durable. For example,
change streams can save time for developers when implementing Extract,
Transform, and Load (ETL) services, cross-platform synchronization,
collaboration functionality, and notification services.

Access Control
--------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-access-control-collection.rst

Event Notification
------------------

Change streams only notify on data changes that have persisted to a majority
of data-bearing members in the replica set. This ensures that notifications are
triggered only by majority-committed changes that are durable in failure
scenarios.

For example, consider a 3-member :term:`replica set` with a change stream
