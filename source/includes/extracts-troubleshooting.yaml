  Installation
  ------------

  The monitoring server does not start up successfully
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Confirm the URI or IP address for the |mms| service is stored correctly
  in the :setting:`mongo.mongoUri` property in the
  ``<install_dir>/conf/conf-mms.properties`` file:

  .. code-block:: ini

     mongo.mongoUri=<SetToValidUri>

  If you don't set this property, |mms| will fail while trying to connect
  to the default 127.0.0.1:27017 URL.

  If the URI or IP address of your service changes, you must update the
  property with the new address. For example, update the address if you
  deploy on a system without a static IP address, or if you deploy on EC2
  without a fixed IP and then restart the EC2 instance.

  If the URI or IP address changes, then each user who access the service
  must also update the address in the URL used to connect and in the
  client-side ``monitoring-agent.config`` files.

  If you use the |mms| :program:`<install_dir>/bin/credentialstool` to
  encrypt the password used in the ``mongo.mongoUri`` value, also add the
  :setting:`mongo.encryptedCredentials` key to the
  ``<install_dir>/conf/conf-mms.properties`` file and set the value for
  this property to true:

  .. code-block:: ini

     mongo.encryptedCredentials=true

  Monitoring Agent Fails to Collect Data
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Possible causes for this state:

  - If the Monitoring Agent can't connect to the server because of
    networking restrictions or issues (i.e. firewalls, proxies, routing.)

  - If your database is running with SSL. You must enable SSL either
    globally or on a per-host basis. See
    :doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-ssl` and
    :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment` for more information.

  - If your database is running with authentication. You must supply |mms|
    with the authentication credentials for the host. See
    :doc:`/tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials`.

  Hosts
  ~~~~~

  .. This "Hosts" section is referring to what are now called "deployments." This section
     also needs updating per the new UI.

  Hosts are not Visible
  +++++++++++++++++++++

  Problems with the Monitoring Agent detecting hosts can be caused by a
  few factors.

  **Host not added**: In |mms|, click :guilabel:`Deployment`,
  then click the :guilabel:`Processes` tab, then click the :guilabel:`Add
  Host` button. In the :guilabel:`New Host` window, specify the host type,
  internal hostname, and port. If appropriate, add the database username
  and password and whether or not |mms| should use SSL to connect with
  your Monitoring Agent. Note it is not necessary to restart your
  Monitoring Agent when adding (or removing) a host.

  **Accidental duplicate mongods** If you add the host after a crash and
  restart the Monitoring Agent, you might not see the hostname on the
  |mms| :guilabel:`Deployment` page. |mms| detects the host as a duplicate
  and suppresses its data. To reset, click :guilabel:`Settings`, then
  :guilabel:`Group Settings`, then the :guilabel:`Reset
  Duplicates` button.

  **Monitoring Agents cannot detect hosts**: If your hosts exist across
  multiple data centers, make sure that all of your hosts can be discovered by
  all of your Monitoring Agents.

  Cannot Delete a Host
  ++++++++++++++++++++

  In rare cases, the :program:`mongod` is brought down and the replica set
  is reconfigured. The down host cannot be deleted and returns an error
  message, "This host cannot be deleted because it is enabled for backup."
  Contact MongoDB Support for help in
  deleting these hosts.

  LDAP
  ~~~~

  Forgot to Change MONGODB-CR Error
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  If your MongoDB deployment uses LDAP for authentication, and you find
  the following error message:

  .. code-block:: none

     You forget to change "MONGODB-CR" to "LDAP (PLAIN)" since they both
     take username/password.

  Then make sure that you specified the ``LDAP (PLAIN)`` as is the
  authentication mechanism for both the Monitoring Agent and the Backup
  Agent. See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-ldap` and
  :doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-ldap`.

  Backup
  ------

  Logs Display MongodVersionException
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The ``MongodVersionException`` can occur if the :ref:`Backup Daemon's
  <backup-daemon>` host cannot access the internet to download the version
  or versions of MongoDB required for the backed-up databases. Each
  database requires a version of MongoDB that matches the database's
  version. Specifically, for each instance you must run the latest stable
  release of that release series.

  If the Daemon runs without access to the internet, you must manually
  download the required MongoDB versions, as described here:

  1. Go to the `MongoDB downloads page <http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>`_
     and download the appropriate versions for your environment.

  2. Copy the download to the Daemon's host.

  3. Decompress the download into the directory specified in the
     :setting:`mongodb.release.directory` setting in the Daemon's
     ``conf-daemon.properties`` file. For the file's location, see
     :doc:`/reference/configuration`.

     Within the directory specified in the
     :setting:`mongodb.release.directory` setting, the folder structure
     for MongoDB should look like the following:

     .. code-block:: sh

        <path-to-mongodb-release-directory>/
        |-- mongodb-<platform>
        |  |-- THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES

  .. _troubleshoot-insufficient-oplog-size-error:

  Insufficient Oplog Size Error
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  When using the |mms| interface to back up a MongoDB cluster, |mms|
  checks to see if the cluster's oplogs are, based on their recent
  usage, large enough to hold a minimum of 3 hours worth of data based
  on the last 24 hours of usage patterns. If the oplogs are not large
  enough, it may be possible that the oplogs may have turned over
  multiple times, creating a gap between where a backup
  ends and an oplog starts.

  If the oplog size check fails, the user cannot enable backups and is
  shown the warning:

  .. code-block:: none

     Insufficient oplog size: The oplog window must be at least 3 hours
     over the last 24 hours for all members of replica set <name>.
     Please increase the oplog.

  If possible, wait to start a backup until the oplog has had
  sufficient time to meet the size requirement.
 
  If this is not possible, the minimum oplog size value can be changed.
  See :setting:`mms.backup.minimumOplogWindowHours` for how to set this
  value. 

  .. warning:: 
     Do not change the minimum oplog size unless you are certain
     smaller backups still provide useful backups.

  .. important::
     MongoDB recommends only changing this value temporarily to permit
     a test backup job to execute. The minimum oplog size value should
     be reset to the default as soon as possible. If an oplog is set to
     too small of a value, it can result in a gap between a backup job
     and an oplog which makes the backup unusuable for restores. Stale
     backup jobs must be resynchronized before it can be used for
     restores.

  Understanding the risks given, you can start backups using this
  changed minimum value. Once you pass the 24 hour mark, you should
  reset this minimum value to preserve the sanity check for the global
  Ops Manager installation going forward.

  System
  ------

  Logs Display OutOfMemoryError
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  If your logs display ``OutOfMemoryError``, ensure you are running with
  sufficient ulimits and RAM.

  Increase Ulimits
  ++++++++++++++++

  For the recommended ulimit setting, see the FAQ on
  :ref:`open-file-limits`.

  |mms| infers the host's ``ulimit`` setting using the total number of
  available and current connections. For more information about ulimits
  in MongoDB, see the :manual:`UNIX ulimit Settings </reference/ulimit/>`
  reference page.

  Ensure Sufficient RAM for All Components
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  - Ensure that each server has enough RAM for the components it runs. If
    a server runs multiple components, its RAM must be at least the sum
    of the required amount of RAM for **each** component.

    For the individual RAM requirements for the |application| server,
    |application| Database, Backup Daemon server, and Backup
    Database, see :doc:`/core/requirements`.

  Obsolete Config Settings
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  |mms| will fail to start if there are obsolete configuration settings
  set in the :doc:`conf-mms.properties </reference/configuration>` file.
  If there is an obsolete setting, the log lists an "Obsolete Setting"
  error as in the following:

  .. code-block:: sh

     [OBSOLETE SETTING] Remove "mms.multiFactorAuth.require" or replace "mms.multiFactorAuth.require" with "mms.multiFactorAuth.level".

  You will need to remove or replace the obsolete property in the
  ``conf-mms.properties`` file before you can start |mms|.
