You can control the shape and contents of documents in a collection by defining
a :ref:`schema <schemas>`. Schemas let you require specific fields, control the
type of a field's value, and validate changes before committing write
operations.

This guide shows you how to define, configure, and deploy a schema for a linked
MongoDB Atlas collection.

Define a Schema
---------------

You can define a schema for a collection in the App Services UI or with the
App Services CLI.

When using the App Services UI, you can choose to:

- Generate a schema from existing data in the collection, and modify as needed.
- Define a schema manually by adding field-level schema definitions.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Navigate to the Schema Screen

            In the left navigation menu, click :guilabel:`Schema` beneath
            :guilabel:`Data Access` to open the schema editor. The Collections
            configuration screen displays in the :guilabel:`Collections` tab.
            Atlas App Services scans your linked cluster for existing
            collections and lists them on the left side of the schema editor.

            Find and select your collection from the menu to show the
            collection configuration on the right side of the schema editor.

               :lightbox:
               :alt: The Schema screen in the App Services UI

         .. step:: Generate a Schema from Existing Data (Optional)

            If you already have data in your collection, App Services can
            sample a subset of the documents in the collection and generate a
            schema for you based on the sample. If you already have a schema or
            prefer to define one manually, skip to the next step.

            You can configure the number of documents to sample and use the
            MongoDB query language to limit the sample to specific documents. By
            default, App Services randomly samples up to 500 documents from
            the entire collection.

            To generate a schema from existing data:

            1. From the collection configuration on the right side of the schema
               editor, click :guilabel:`Generate Schema` to open the sample configuration
               screen.

            2. Specify the sample size, up to a maximum of 50,000 documents.

            3. Optionally, click :guilabel:`Advanced` and specify a query,
               projection, and/or sort to refine the sample query. Use the query
               and sort filters to sample a specific subset of documents and use
               the projection filter to sample a specific subset of fields from
               each document.

            4. Click :guilabel:`Generate` to run the sample query and generate a
               schema. The process may take up to a minute depending on the number
               and contents of the sampled documents.

         .. step:: Define or Modify the Schema

            You can define a schema manually or modify an existing schema by adding field-level schema definitions.

            You may define a single BSON schema for each collection. The root-level type
            of each collection schema is an ``object`` schema that represents a document
            in the collection. You can define additional schemas for document fields
            within the root schema's ``properties`` field.

            The fields available in a JSON schema object depend on the type of value that
            the schema defines. For a list of supported types and details on how to
            configure them, see :ref:`schema types <schema-types>`.

            .. example::

               A group is using App Services to run a voting app where users aged 13 or
               older can submit a ranked list of their favorite colors. They store
               the votes in a MongoDB collection named ``votes`` where each
               document represents a single person's vote. Each vote must include
               the person's name, age, and an array of their favorite colors. Each
               color has a ``rank``, ``name``, and a ``hexCode``.
               The following is a typical document in the ``votes`` collection:

               .. code-block:: json

                  {
                    "name": "Jane Doe",
                    "age": 42,
                    "favoriteColors": [
                      { "rank": 1, "name": "RebeccaPurple", "hexCode": "#663399" },
                      { "rank": 2, "name": "DodgerBlue", "hexCode": "#1E90FF" },
                      { "rank": 3, "name": "SeaGreen", "hexCode": "#2E8B57" },
                    ]
                  }

               The group can use the following schema to guarantee that the listed
               constraints are satisfied for each document in the ``votes``
               collection:

               .. code-block:: json

                  {
                    "bsonType": "object",
                    "required": ["name", "age", "favoriteColors"],
                    "properties": {
                      "name": {
                        "bsonType": "string"
                      },
                      "age": {
                        "bsonType": "int",
                        "minimum": 13,
                        "exclusiveMinimum": false
                      },
                      "favoriteColors": {
                        "bsonType": "array",
                        "uniqueItems": true,
                        "items": {
                          "bsonType": "object",
                          "properties": {
                            "rank": { "bsonType": "int" },
                            "name": { "bsonType": "string" },
                            "hexCode": {
                              "bsonType": "string",
                              "pattern": "^#([A-Fa-f0-9]{6}|[A-Fa-f0-9]{3})$"
                            }
                          }
                        }
                      }
                    }
                  }

         .. step:: Add Change Validation Expressions (Optional)

            In addition to configuring the content of each field, you can validate changes
            to documents by defining a validation :ref:`expression <expressions>` in the
            ``validate`` field of a schema. Validation expressions can use the
            :json-expansion:`%%prev` and :json-expansion:`%%prevRoot` expansions to access
            a field or document's values *before* the insert or update operation occurred.

            .. example::

               Consider a collection where the document's ``owner_id`` field
               represents the owner of each document. The business rules for this
               collection specify that once a document has an owner, the value of
               ``owner_id`` should never change. We can enforce this constraint
               with the following validation expression that ensures that update
               operations do not change the ``owner_id`` value unless its to
               assign an owner where there was none previously:

               .. code-block:: javascript

                  "owner_id": {
                    "validate": {
                      "%or": [
                        { "%%prev": { "%exists": false } },
                        { "%%prev": "%%this" }
                      ]
                    }
                  }

               We could also use the :json-expansion:`%%prevRoot` expansion to
               create the following equivalent validation expression:

               .. code-block:: javascript

                  "owner_id": {
                    "validate": {
                      "%or": [
                        { "%%prevRoot.owner_id": { "%exists": false } },
                        { "%%prevRoot.owner_id": "%%root.owner_id" }
                      ]
                    }
                  }


         .. step:: Save the Schema

            After you have configured the schema, click :guilabel:`Save`. After
            saving, App Services immediately begins enforcing the schema for all future
            queries.

            .. note::

               Existing documents that do not match the schema are not
               automatically updated or validated, so future changes to these
               documents may cause schema validation failures.


         .. step:: Validate Documents Against the Schema

            Once you have saved the collection schema, you can validate that
            existing documents in the collection conform to the schema.

            App Services samples documents for validation as it does for
            automatic schema generation.

            To validate the data in a collection:

            1. Click the :guilabel:`Run Validation` button to open the validation configuration window.

            2. Specify the sample size, up to a maximum of 50,000 documents.

            3. Optionally, click :guilabel:`Advanced` and specify a query and/or
               sort to refine the validation to a specific subset of documents.

            4. Click :guilabel:`Run Validation` to sample documents from the collection
               and validate each document against the schema.

            Once validation is complete, App Services lists any validation
            errors from the sample in the :guilabel:`JSON Validation Errors`
            table. Each row of the table represents a specific type of validation
            error for a particular field and indicates the number of documents
            that failed to validate in that way.

            For each validation error, you can use the :guilabel:`Actions` menu to
            download the raw documents that failed or copy a MongoDB query that
            finds the failed documents.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Log In to MongoDB Cloud

            To configure your app with {+cli-bin+}, you must log in to MongoDB Cloud using
            an :atlas:`API key </reference/api-resources-spec/v2/>` scoped to the organization or
            project that contains the app.

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} login --api-key="<MongoDB Cloud Public API Key>" --private-api-key="<MongoDB Cloud Private API Key>"


         .. step:: Pull the Latest Version of Your App

            To define a document schema with ``{+cli-bin+}``, you need a local copy of your
            application's configuration files.

            To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

            .. tip::

               You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
               the :guilabel:`Deploy > Import/Export App` screen in the App Services UI.


         .. step:: Define the Schema

            To define or modify the schema for a collection, open the ``schema.json``
            configuration file within the collection's configuration directory.

            .. tip:: Scaffold the Collection

               If you haven't already defined rules or a schema for the collection, you
               need to manually create its configuration directory and ``schema.json``:

               .. code-block:: bash

                  # Create the collection's configuration directory
                  mkdir -p data_sources/<service>/<db>/<collection>
                  # Create the collection's schema file
                  echo '{}' >> data_sources/<service>/<db>/<collection>/schema.json

            The root-level schema for every document must be of type ``object``. You can
            use additional :ref:`schema <schemas>` to configure specific fields within the
            ``properties`` array. At a minimum, the schema should resemble the following:

            .. code-block:: javascript
               :caption: /data_sources/<service>/<db>/<collection>/schema.json

               {
                 "bsonType": "object",
                 "properties": {
                   "<Field Name>": <Schema Document>,
                   ...
                 }
               }


         .. step:: Define Change Validation (Optional)

            You can validate changes to documents by defining a validation
            :ref:`expression <expressions>` in the ``validate`` field of a schema.
            Validation expressions can use the :json-expansion:`%%prev` and
            :json-expansion:`%%prevRoot` expansions to access a field or document's values
            *before* the insert or update operation occurred.

            .. example::

               Consider a collection where the document's ``owner_id`` field represents
               the owner of each document. The business rules for this collection specify
               that once a document has an owner, the value of ``owner_id`` should never
               change. We can enforce this constraint with the following validation
               expression that ensures that update operations do not change the
               ``owner_id`` value unless its to assign an owner where there was none
               previously:

               .. code-block:: javascript

                  "owner_id": {
                    "validate": {
                      "%or": [
                        { "%%prev": { "%exists": false } },
                        { "%%prev": "%%this" }
                      ]
                    }
                  }

               We could also use the :json-expansion:`%%prevRoot` expansion to create the
               following equivalent validation expression:

               .. code-block:: javascript

                  "owner_id": {
                    "validate": {
                      "%or": [
                        { "%%prevRoot.owner_id": { "%exists": false } },
                        { "%%prevRoot.owner_id": "%%root.owner_id" }
                      ]
                    }
                  }


         .. step:: Deploy the Updated Schema

            Once you've defined and saved ``schema.json`` you can push the updated config
            to your remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys the new schema on push.

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} push --remote="<Your App ID>"


.. _validate-null-types:

Validate Null Types
-------------------

App Services's default behavior is to only accept a single type for each field.
Schema fields are not nullable by default because ``null`` is a unique
:manual:`BSON type </reference/bson-types/>`.

You can configure App Services to pass schema validation when you use ``null``
values with optional fields.
Enabling null type validation allows the value for a field to be persisted as
the type in the schema or the :manual:`BSON null </reference/bson-types/>` type.
If you do not enable null type schema validation, App Services rejects ``null``
values passed to optional fields. Even if you enable null type validation,
required fields are never nullable.

To enable null type schema validation in the App Services UI:

#. In the left navigation menu below the :guilabel:`Manage` header, select :guilabel:`App Settings`.
#. On the :guilabel:`General` tab, navigate to the :guilabel:`Null Type Schema Validation`
   section. Toggle the switch to :guilabel:`ON`.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Save` button.
