==========================================
Perform Maintenance on Replica Set Members
==========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` make it possible to continue to
serve client queries while administrators perform maintenance on each
member of the set.

Use this procedure to implement your own replica set maintenance
operations. These steps minimize the number of elections that must
take place during maintenance, and help ensure uptime as you bring
each member down in turn.

This procedure is the basis for common replica set operations
documented in this manual, such as :doc:`upgrading to the latest
version of MongoDB </tutorial/upgrade-revision>` and :doc:`changing
the size of the oplog</tutorial/change-oplog-size>`.

Procedure
---------

For each member of a replica set, perform the following sequence of
operations. Start with a secondary member of the set, proceed through
each secondary in turn, and end with the primary. This ensures that
the set only has to elect a new primary once.

#. Restart the :program:`mongod` instance as a standalone.

#. Perform the task on the standalone instance.

#. Restart the :program:`mongod` instance as a member of the replica
   set.

.. _stop-a-secondary:

Stop a Secondary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the :program:`mongo` shell, shut down the :program:`mongod`
instance:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.shutdownServer()

Restart the Secondary as a Standalone on a Different Port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the operating system shell prompt, restart :program:`mongod`
as a standalone instance running on a different port and *without*
the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` parameter:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --port 37017 --dbpath /srv/mongodb

Perform Maintenance Operations on the Secondary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the member is a standalone, use the :program:`mongo` shell to
perform maintenance:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --port 37017

Restart ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After performing all maintenance tasks, use the following procedure
to restart the :program:`mongod` as a secondary member of the replica
set on its usual port.

#. Shut down the standalone server:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.shutdownServer()

#. Restart the :program:`mongod` instance as a secondary member of
   the replica set using its normal command-line arguments or
   configuration file.

#. The secondary takes time to :doc:`catch up to the primary
   </core/replica-set-sync>`. Use the following command to verify
   that the member has caught up from the :replstate:`RECOVERING`
   to the :replstate:`SECONDARY` state.

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.status()

Perform Maintenance on the Primary Last
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After completing maintenance tasks on all secondaries, you must
request that the primary step down and allow one of the secondaries
to be elected the new primary.

In the :program:`mongo` shell, use :method:`rs.stepDown` to step down
the primary. Specify a 300 second waiting period to prevent the member
from being elected primary again:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.stepDown(300)

Once the primary becomes a secondary, the replica set elects a new
primary, as described in :doc:`/core/replica-set-elections`.

Repeat the steps of the current procedure to perform maintenance on
the new secondary, starting with :ref:`stop-a-secondary`.
