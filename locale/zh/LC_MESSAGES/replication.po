"A *replica set* in MongoDB is a group of :program:`mongod` processes that "
"maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high "
"availability, and are the basis for all production deployments. This section"
" introduces replication in MongoDB as well as the components and "
"architecture of replica sets. The section also provides tutorials for common"
" tasks related to replica sets."
