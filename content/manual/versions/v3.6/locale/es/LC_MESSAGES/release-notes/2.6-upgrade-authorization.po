"MongoDB 2.6 includes significant changes to the authorization model, "

"deployment uses authentication and authorization, after upgrading all "
"MongoDB process to 2.6 you **must** also upgrade the authorization model."

"Before upgrading the authorization model, you should first upgrade "

"Because downgrades are more difficult after you upgrade the user "
"authorization model, once you upgrade the MongoDB binaries to version "
"2.6, allow your MongoDB deployment to run a day or two **without** "
"upgrading the user authorization model."

msgid ""
"This allows 2.6 some time to \"burn in\" and decreases the likelihood of "
"downgrades occurring after the user privilege model upgrade. The user "
"authentication and access control will continue to work as it did in 2.4,"
" **but** it will be impossible to create or modify users or to use user-"
"defined roles until you run the authorization upgrade."
