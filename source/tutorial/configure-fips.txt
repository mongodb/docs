Overview
--------

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is a U.S. government
computer security standard used to certify software modules and
libraries that encrypt and decrypt data securely.  You can configure
MongoDB to run with a FIPS 140-2 certified library
for OpenSSL. Configure FIPS to run by default or as needed from the
command line.

.. topic:: MongoDB and FIPS

   FIPS is property of the encryption system and not the access control
   system. However, if your environment requires FIPS compliant encryption
   *and* access control, you must ensure that the access control system
   uses only FIPS-compliant encryption.

   MongoDB's FIPS support covers the way that MongoDB uses SSL/TLS
   libraries for network encryption, SCRAM authentication, and x.509
   authentication. If you use Kerberos or LDAP authentication, you must
   ensure that these external mechanisms are FIPS-compliant.

Platform Support
----------------

.. _`MongoDB Enterprise`: http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server

FIPS mode is only available with `MongoDB Enterprise`_ edition. See
:doc:`/administration/install-enterprise` to download and install
`MongoDB Enterprise`_.

FIPS mode is supported on the following platforms:

.. container::

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Platform
        - TLS/SSL library

      * - Linux
        - OpenSSL

      * - Windows
        - Secure Channel (SChannel)

      * - macOS
        - Secure Transport

Configuring FIPS
----------------

Select the tab below for your platform:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Linux
      :tabid: linux-fips-config

      Prerequisites
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Your Linux system must have an OpenSSL library configured with the FIPS
      140-2 module in order to support FIPS mode for MongoDB.

      - Verify that your OpenSSL software includes FIPS support by running
        the following command:

        .. code-block:: sh

          openssl version

      - For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x (RHEL 6.x) or its derivatives such
        as CentOS 6.x, the OpenSSL toolkit must be at least version
        ``openssl-1.0.1e-16.el6_5`` to use FIPS mode. To upgrade the OpenSSL
        library on these platforms, run the following command:

        .. code-block:: sh

          sudo yum update openssl

      - Some versions of Linux periodically execute a process to prelink
        dynamic libraries with pre-assigned addresses. This process modifies
        the OpenSSL libraries, specifically ``libcrypto``. The OpenSSL FIPS
        mode will subsequently fail the signature check performed upon
        startup to ensure ``libcrypto`` has not been modified since
        compilation.

        To configure the Linux prelink process to not prelink ``libcrypto``,
        run the following command:

        .. code-block:: sh

          sudo bash -c "echo '-b /usr/lib64/libcrypto.so.*' >>/etc/prelink.conf.d/openssl-prelink.conf"

      Once you have configured your Linux system to support FIPS-compliant
      operation, follow the steps below to configure your
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance to operate in
      FIPS mode.

      Procedure
      ~~~~~~~~~

      A. Configure MongoDB to use TLS/SSL
      ```````````````````````````````````

      See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for details about configuring your
      deployment to use TLS/SSL. Ensure that your certificate is
      FIPS-compliant.

      B. Run MongoDB instance in FIPS mode
      ````````````````````````````````````

      Perform these steps after you :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/fips-config.rst

      C. Confirm that FIPS mode is running
      ````````````````````````````````````

      Check the server log file for a message that FIPS is active:

      .. code-block:: sh

        FIPS 140-2 mode activated


   .. tab:: Windows
      :tabid: windows-fips-config

      Prerequisites
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Microsoft provides the following resource on configuring FIPS mode for
      Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 or later:

      .. _`FIPS 140-2 Validation on Windows`: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/fips-140-validation

      |arrow| `FIPS 140-2 Validation on Windows`_

      Once you have configured your Windows system to support FIPS-compliant
      operation, follow the steps below to configure your
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance to operate in
      FIPS mode.

      Procedure
      ~~~~~~~~~

      A. Configure MongoDB to use TLS/SSL
      ```````````````````````````````````

      See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for details about configuring your
      deployment to use TLS/SSL. Ensure that your certificate is
      FIPS-compliant.

      B. Run MongoDB instance in FIPS mode
      ````````````````````````````````````

      Perform these steps after you :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/fips-config-windows.rst

      C. Confirm that FIPS mode is running
      ````````````````````````````````````

      Check the server log file for a message that FIPS is active:

      .. code-block:: sh

        FIPS 140-2 mode activated

   .. tab:: macOS
      :tabid: macos-fips-config

      Prerequisites
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Supported versions of macOS are FIPS-compliant by default. Check the
      documentation for your version of macOS to verify its compliance
      status. For example, Apple provides the following resource for
      macOS 10.14:

      .. _`Apple FIPS Cryptographic Modules for 10.14`: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209638

      |arrow| `Apple FIPS Cryptographic Modules for 10.14`_

      On compliant versions of macOS, follow the steps below to configure your
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance to operate in
      FIPS mode.

      Procedure
      ~~~~~~~~~

      A. Configure MongoDB to use TLS/SSL
      ```````````````````````````````````

      See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for details about configuring your
      deployment to use TLS/SSL. Ensure that your certificate is
      FIPS-compliant.

      B. Run MongoDB instance in FIPS mode
      ````````````````````````````````````

      Perform these steps after you :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/fips-config.rst

      C. Confirm that FIPS mode is running
      ````````````````````````````````````

      Check the server log file for a message that FIPS is active:

      .. code-block:: sh

        FIPS 140-2 mode activated
