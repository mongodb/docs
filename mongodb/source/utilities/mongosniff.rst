mongosniff Utility Manual
=========================

Synopsis
--------

``mongosniff`` provides a low-level operation tracing/sniffing view
into database activity in real time. Think of ``mongosniff`` as a
MongoDB-specific analogue of ``tcpdump`` for TCP/IP network
traffic. Typically, ``mongosniff`` is most frequently used in drier
development.

.. note::

   ``mongosniff`` requires "libcap" and is only available for
   Unix-like systems.

   The Wireshark network sniffing tool is capable of inspecting and
   parsing the MongoDB wire protocol.

Options
-------

.. program:: mongosniff

.. option:: --help

   Returns a basic help and usage text.

.. option:: --forward <host>:<port>

   Declares a host to forward all parsed requests to another
   ``mongod`` instance. Specify host name and port in the
   "``<host>:<port>``" format.

TODO understand what this is and why this is the post.

.. option:: --source <NET [interface]>, <FILE [filename]>

   Specifies source material to inspect. Use "``--source NET
   [interface]``" to inspect traffic from a network interface
   (e.g. ``eth0`` or ``lo``.) Use "``--source FILE [filename]``" to
   read captured packets in :term:`pcap` format.

.. option::  --objcheck

   Modifies the behavior to *only* display invalid BSON objects and
   nothing else. Use this option for troubleshooting driver
   development.

.. option:: <port>

   Specifies alternate ports to sniff for traffic. By default,
   ``mongosniff`` watches for MongoDB traffic on port 27017. Append
   multiple port numbers to the end of ``mongosniff`` to monitor
   traffic on multiple ports.

Usage Examples
--------------

Use the following command to connect to a ``mongod`` or ``mongos``
running on port 27017 *and* 27018 on the localhost interface: ::

     mongosniff --source NET lo 27017 27018

Use the following command to only log invalid BSON objects for the
``mongod`` or ``mongos`` running on the localhost interface and port
27018, for driver development and troubleshooting: ::

     mongosniff --objcheck --source NET lo 27018
