title: Find the ``mongo`` Shell
ref: mongo-shell

  The ``mongo`` shell is packaged with the MongoDB Server Community and
  Enterprise distributions, and is also available for users of Atlas as
  a client-only download.

  MongoDB binaries are located in a directory that starts with
  "mongodb-". You should see a file named ``mongo``, which is the shell
  executable.

  If you do not have ``mongo`` shell installed, follow the install
  directions for your environment.

  It is a good idea to keep your admin user credentials separate from
  users that will read and write to the databases on a regular basis.

  In this step, create a user that you will use throughout the guides
  for reading and writing test data.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.createUser(
       {
         user: "userreadwrite",
         pwd: "abc123",
         roles: [ { role: "readWriteAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
       }
     )

title: Check whether your users have been added 
ref: check_users

  Run ``show users`` to see if your users were created.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     show users

  You should see output similar to the following:

  .. code-block:: sh

     {
       "_id" : "admin.myUserAdmin",
       "user" : "myUserAdmin",
       "db" : "admin",
       "roles" : [
         {
           "role" : "userAdminAnyDatabase",
           "db" : "admin"
         }
       ],
       "mechanisms" : [
         "SCRAM-SHA-1",
         "SCRAM-SHA-256"
       ]
     }
     {
       "_id" : "admin.userreadwrite",
       "user" : "userreadwrite",
       "db" : "admin",
       "roles" : [
         {
           "role" : "readWriteAnyDatabase",
           "db" : "admin"
         }
       ],
       "mechanisms" : [
         "SCRAM-SHA-1",
         "SCRAM-SHA-256"
       ]
