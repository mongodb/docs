title: Write an implied AND query.

  To write a compound query in MongoDB that matches all of the query
  predicates (i.e. a logical AND), specify all of the fields that you
  wish to match in your find document. By default, MongoDB matches all
  of the fields.
    
  The following example retrieves all documents in the ``inventory``
  collection where the ``status`` equals ``"A"`` **and** ``qty`` is less
  than (:query:`$lt`) ``30``:

  .. include:: /includes/driver-example-query-11.rst

  MongoDB also provides a :query:`~op.$and` logical operator as part of
  its logical query operators, but the "implied AND" described above is
  a more common pattern.

  If you have loaded data into your test database, you will see one or
  more JSON documents returned. Your results should look something like
  the JSON below. Note that the record below has a ``status`` of ``"A"``
  and a ``qty`` less than ``30`` per the criteria in the compound query.

  If you have loaded data into your test database, you will see one or
  more JSON documents returned. Note that the record has a ``status`` of ``"A"``
  but a ``qty`` of more than ``30``, which is acceptable according to
  the :query:`$or` criteria.
