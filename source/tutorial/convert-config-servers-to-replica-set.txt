Overview
--------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/csrs-conversion-admonition.rst

In a sharded cluster, config servers store the metadata for the sharded
cluster. For a sharded cluster to be fully operational, the config
servers must be available and the metadata must be consistent across
the config servers.

Beginning in MongoDB 3.2, :term:`config servers <config server>`, that
run the WiredTiger storage engine, can be deployed as replica sets.
Running config servers as replica sets improves consistency and
increases availability for the config servers.

For new sharded cluster deployments using MongoDB 3.2, |mms| deploys
config servers as a replica set.

For existing sharded cluster deployments that are not running config
servers as replica sets, you can convert the config servers to replica
sets.

You can manage config server replica sets just as you would any other
replica set.

Prerequisites
-------------

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/csrs-conversion-cloud-services-version-prereq.rst

- MongoDB 3.2.4 or Later
    To convert the config servers to a replica set, the sharded cluster
    must be running MongoDB 3.2.4 or later versions. To upgrade the
    MongoDB version, see :doc:`/tutorial/change-mongodb-version`.

- Three Config Servers to Convert
    The sharded cluster must be running exactly three config servers to
    convert. After the conversion of the config servers to a replica
    set, you can add additional members to the config server replica
    set.

- Write Permission for Parent Directory of ``dbPath``
    The Automation Agent must have write permission on the **parent**
    directory of the ``dbPath`` of each config server.

Procedure
---------

.. note::

   During the conversion of the config servers to a replica set, 

   - If the config servers use the MMAPv1 :term:`storage engine`, |mms|
     changes the storage engine to WiredTiger.

   - |mms| creates temporary config servers, and automation eventually
     deletes these config servers after the conversion. However, if your
     Monitoring Agent should detect them at any point during the
     conversion, they will appear as unreachable hosts in your
     deployments list. After the conversion, you can safely delete them
     from the list. See :doc:`/tutorial/unmanage-deployment`.
