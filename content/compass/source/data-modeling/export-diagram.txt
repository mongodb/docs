You can share your refactored data model with other teams to receive feedback 
and align on final schema design decisions. To share your refactored schema, you 
can export your |erd| from |compass-short|. 

About this Task
---------------

You can export your |erd| as a: 

- :guilabel:`Diagram File`.
- :guilabel:`PNG` image.
- :guilabel:`JSON` file. 

When you export your diagram as a :guilabel:`Diagram File`, |compass-short| 
exports the diagram as a ``.mdm`` file. This file format allows you to 
import the diagram into |compass-short|, which can be helpful when sharing your 
|erd| with collaborators that also use |compass-short|.

When you export your diagram as a PNG image, |compass-short| 
exports the collections and their relationships as they appear in the 
:guilabel:`Data Modeling` tab. This format helps you share a visual 
representation of your schema in documentation or presentations.

When you export your diagram as a JSON file, it includes: 

- A ``collections`` array with the collection namespaces and their 
  :query:`jsonSchema <$jsonSchema>`. 

- A ``relationships`` array with the namespaces of the related 
  collections and their linked fields.

:ref:`generated a diagram <compass-data-modeling>`.
