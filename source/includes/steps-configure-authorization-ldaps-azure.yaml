stepnum: 5
content: |

  When a user attempts to perform an action, |service| executes the 
  :manual:`LDAP query template 
  </reference/configuration-options/#security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate>`
  to obtain the LDAP groups to which the authenticated user belongs.
  |service| permits the action if the query returns at least one group 
  that is authorized to perform the action. |Service| does not permit 
  the action if the query returns no groups that are authorized to 
  perform the action.
  
  |service| substitutes the authenticated username in the ``{USER}`` 
  placeholder when it runs the query. The query is relative to the host 
  specified in :guilabel:`Server Hostname`. 
  
  The formatting for the query must conform to `RFC4515 
  <https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4515>`_

  If you want to identify what group a user is a member of, you can use
  the default :guilabel:`Query Template`:

  .. code-block:: sh

     {USER}?memberOf?base
    
  .. note::
      
     Other query templates may also work.
