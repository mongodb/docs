=========================================
Application Development with Replica Sets
=========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

From the perspective of the client applications, whether a MongoDB
instance is a single server (i.e. "standalone") or a replica set is
mostly irrelevant. While specific configuration depends to some extent
on the client :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>`, there is often
minimal or no differences between applications running with
:term:`replica sets <replica set>` or standalone instances.

This document, however, addresses several topics that will help
application developers take advantage of replica sets.

.. _replica-set-write-concern:

Write Concern
-------------

When a :term:`client` sends a write operation to a database server,
the operation will return without waiting for the operation to succeed
or complete. The :dbcommand:`getLastError` command provides a way to
check if write operations have succeeded, and provides operations to
require various levels of write concern. These levels are:

- without options. Confirms that the server has received the write
  operations, and modified the :program:`mongod` instances in-memory
  representation of the data.

- with the ``j`` or "journal" option. Confirms that the server has committed
  the data to the on-disk journal. This ensures that the data will be
  durable in the event that :program:`mongod` experiences an
  unexpected shut down.

- with the ``fsync`` option. Confirms that the :program:`mongod` has
  flushed the write operation to disk. Do not use this operation in
  normal production situations: use ``j`` to ensure this level of
  durability.

- for replica sets, with the ``w`` option. Confirms that the write
  operation has replicated to the specified number of
  replica set members. You may specify a number of servers *or*
  ``majority`` to ensure that the write propagates to a majority of
  set members.

Many drivers have a "safe" mode or "write concern" that automatically
issues a :dbcommand:`getLastError` command following write operations
to ensure that they complete. "Safe mode," provides confirmation of
write operations to the client. However, safe writes can take longer
to return and are not required in all applications. Consider the
following operations.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { getLastError: 1, w: "majority" } )
   db.getLastErrorObj("majority")

Following a write operation, these equivalent
:dbcommand:`getLastError` operations will ensure that write operations
return only after a write operation has replicated to a majority of
the members of the set. You might also specify ``w: 2`` so that the
write operation replicates to a second member before the command
returns.

.. note::

   :dbcommand:`getLastError` assumes the primary replica node, which
   is equivalent to ``w: 1``. ``w: 2`` waits until 2 members of the
   set, or the :term:`primary` and one other member of the replica set
   before confirming the write operation.

   If you specify a ``w`` value greater than the number running
   members of the set, the operation will block until those numbers
   join the set. Use the ``wtimeoute`` argument to specify a timeout
   threshold for the :dbcommand:`getLastError` operation.

   ``w: 0`` is valid but has no effect, and is equivelent to a no-op.

You can also configure a "default" :dbcommand:`getLastError` behavior
for the replica set configuration. Use the
:data:`settings.getLastErrorDefaults` setting in the :doc:`replica set
configuration </reference/replica-configuration>`. For instance:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.settings.getLastErrorDefaults = {w: "majority", j: true}
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

When the new configuration is active, the :dbcommand:`getLastError`
operation will wait for the write operation to complete on a majority
of the set members before returning. By specifying ``j: true``,
:dbcommand:`getLastError` waits for a complete commit of the
operations to the journal before returning.

Use the :data:`getLastErrorDefaults`" setting in the :term:`replica
set` configuration to define the standards for a set-wide "safe mode."
The default setting will only affect :dbcommand:`getLastError`
commands with *no* other arguments.

Read Preference
---------------

Read preference describes how MongoDB clients route read operations to
:term:`secondary` members of a :term:`replica set`. The
:ref:`background <replica-set-read-preference-background>` section
introduces read preference, while the :ref:`mode semantics
<replica-set-read-preference-modes>` and :ref:`behavior
<replica-set-read-preference-behavior>` sections address the way that
MongoDB clients and drivers can handle read preferences. Finally, the
:ref:`tag sets <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>` section
outlines read preference tagging for custom read preference
configuration, which provides a component of "data center awareness."

.. index:: read preference; background
.. _replica-set-read-preference-background:

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

By default, applications direct read operations to the
:term:`primary` member in a :term:`replica set`. When reading from the
the primary, all read operations reflect the latest version of the document.
However, you can improve read
throughput by distributing some or all reads to secondary members of
the replica set as needed. While secondary reads may return stale data
this is acceptable for applications that do not require fully up to date data.

Reads from secondaries may be stale MongoDB can
not guarantee that secondary members will reflect the state
of the primary, which receives all incoming write operations. Do not
allow secondary reads, unless your application can handle receiving
stale data.

In many cases, your application will require the most current document
that primary reads provide. However, the following use cases outline
several potetial use cases for other read preferences:

- running systems operations including backups and reports without
  impacting the front-end application.

- providing low-latency queries for geographically distributed
  deployments. If one secondary is closer to an application server
  than the primary or the rest of the set, you may see better
  performance for that application if you use secondary reads.

- providing graceful degradation in :ref:`failover
  <replica-set-failover>` situations, when a set can have *no* primary
  for 10 seconds or more. If a set does not have a primary,
  applications with :readmode:`primary` cannot perform reads. Use the
  :readmode:`primaryPrefered` read preference in this situation.

MongoDB :term:`drivers <driver>` allow client applications to
configure a :term:`read preference` on a per-connection, per-collection or
per-operation basis. See the :func:`rs.slaveOk()` method for more
information about secondary read operations in the :program:`mongo`
shell, as well as the appropriate :ref:`driver` API documentation for
more information about read preference configuration. The
:ref:`semantics <replica-set-read-preference-semantics>` and
:ref:`behavior <replica-set-read-preference-behavior>` sections also
address read preference configuration and operations.

.. note::

   Read preferences affect how the application selects a member of the
   replica set to use for read operations. As a result read
   preferences dictate if the application will receive stale or
   current data from MongoDB. Use appropriate :ref:`write concern
   <replica-set-write-concern>` policies to ensure proper data
   replication and constancy.

   If read operations account for a large percentage of your
   application's traffic, distributing reads to secondary members may
   improve read throughput. However, in most cases :doc:`sharding
   </core/sharding>` will provide better support for larger scale
   operations, because shard clusters can distribute read and write
   operations across a group of machines.

Read Preference Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.2

All MongoDB drivers :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>` support the
following read preference modes. These semantics make it possible to
specify read preference on a per-collection or per-operation
basis. The member of the :term:`replica set` that the client reads from
can affect how current or stale the result set is. See the :ref:`read
preference background <replica-set-read-preference-background>` and
:ref:`read preference behavior <replica-set-read-preference-behavior>`
for more information. Also see the :api:`documentation for your driver
<>` for specific read preference use. :program:`mongos` also supports
all read-preference modes in its connections to the replica sets that
provide each :term:`shard` in a :term:`shard cluster`.

All MongoDB drivers provide five read
preference modes, which are constants set in the drivers
themselves. While the names are the same, the exact syntax depends the idioms
of the host language. In the :program:`mongo` shell, the
:func:`readPreference() <cursor.readPreference()>` cursor method
provides access to read preferences, which have the following names.

.. readmode:: primary

   With :readmode:`primary`, all read operations from the client will
   use the :term:`primary` member only.

   This is the default read preference.

   If the primary is unavailable, all operations with this preference
   produce an error or throw an exception. :readmode:`primary` read
   preference modes are not compatible with read preferences modes
   that use :ref:`tag sets <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>` If
   you specify a tag set with :readmode:`primary`, the driver will
   produce an error.

   The :readmode:`primary` mode sacrifices availability for
   consistency, in terms of the :term:`CAP Theorem`.

.. readmode:: primaryPrefered

   With the :readmode:`primaryPrefered` read preference mode,
   operations will read from the :term:`primary` member of the set in
   most situations. However, if the primary is unavailable, as is the
   case during :term:`failover` situations, then these read operations
   can read from secondary members.

   When the read preference includes a :ref:`tag set <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`,
   the client will first read from the primary, if it is available, and
   then from :term:`secondaries <secondary>` that match the specified
   tags. If there are no secondaries with tags that match the
   specified tags, this read operation will produce an error.

   The :readmode:`primaryPrefered` mode sacrifices consistency for
   greater availability, in terms of the :term:`CAP Theorem`.

.. readmode:: secondary

   With the :readmode:`secondary` read preference mode, operations
   will read from the :term:`secondary` member of the set if available.
   However, if there are no secondaries available, then these
   operations will produce an error or exception.

   Most sets have at least one secondary, but there are situations
   where there may not be an available secondary. For example, a set
   with a primary, a secondary, and an :term:`arbiter` may not have
   any secondaries if a member is ever in recovering mode.

   When the read preference includes a :ref:`tag set <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`,
   the client will attempt to find a secondary members that match the
   specified tag set and directs reads to a random secondary from
   among the :ref:`nearest group <replica-set-read-preference-behavior-nearest>`.
   If there are no secondaries with tags that match the specified tag
   set, this read operation will produce an error.

   The :readmode:`secondary` mode sacrifices consistency for
   greater availability, in terms of the :term:`CAP Theorem`.

.. readmode:: secondaryPrefered

   With the :readmode:`secondaryPrefered`, operations will read from
   :term:`secondary` members, but in situations where the set *only*
   has a :term:`primary` instance, the read operation will use the
   set's primary.

   When :readmode:`secondaryPrefered` reads from a secondary and the
   read preference includes a :ref:`tag set <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`,
   the client will attempt to find a secondary members that match the
   specified tag set and directs reads to a random secondary from
   among the :ref:`nearest group <replica-set-read-preference-behavior-nearest>`.
   If there are no secondaries with tags that match the specified tag
   set, this read operation will produce an error.

   The :readmode:`secondaryPrefered` mode sacrifices consistency for
   greater availability, in terms of the :term:`CAP Theorem`.

.. readmode:: nearest

   With the :readmode:`nearest`, the driver will read from the
   *nearest* member of the :term:`set <replica set>` according to
   the :ref:`member selection <replica-set-read-preference-behavior-nearest>`
   process :readmode:`nearest` read operations will not have any
   consideration for the *type* of the set member. Reads in
   :readmode:`nearest` mode may read from both primaries and
   secondaries.

   Set this mode when you want minimize the effect of network latency
   on read operations without preference for current or stale data.

   If you specify a :ref:`tag set <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`,
   the client will attempt to find a secondary members that match the
   specified tag set and directs reads to a random secondary from
   among the :ref:`nearest group <replica-set-read-preference-behavior-nearest>`.

   .. note::

      All operations read from the nearest member of the replica set
      that matches the specified read preference mode.
      :readmode:`nearest` prefers low latency reads over a
      member's :term:`primary` or :term:`secondary` status.

   .. For I/O-bound users who want to distribute reads across all
      members evenly regardless of ping time, set
      secondaryAcceptableLatencyMS very high.

.. The :func:`readPreference() <cursor.readPreference()>` reference
   above will error until DOCS-364 is complete.

.. index:: tag sets
.. index:: read preference; tag sets
.. _replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets:

Tag Sets
~~~~~~~~

Tag sets allow you to specify custom :ref:`read preferences
<replica-set-read-preference>`, so that your application can target
read operations to specific members based on custom parameters. Tag
sets make it possible to ensure that read operations target members of
the set in a particular data center, or :program:`mongod` instances
designated for a particular class of operations, such as reporting or
analytics. The :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration` document
contains a section on :ref:`tag set configuration
<replica-set-configuration-tag-sets>`.

Read preference :ref:`modes <replica-set-read-preference-modes>` interact
with tag sets, as specified in the documentation of each read
preference mode. The :readmode:`primary` read preference mode is
incompatible with tag sets, but you may specify a tag set with one of
each of the following read preference modes:

- :readmode:`primaryPrefered`
- :readmode:`secondary`
- :readmode:`secondaryPrefered`
- :readmode:`nearest`

Tags only apply when :ref:`selecting <replica-set-read-preference-behavior-member-selection>`
a :term:`secondary` member of the set, *except* for the
:readmode:`nearest` mode. See the documentation of each read preference mode for more
information on the interaction of the read preference mode and tag
sets. All interfaces use the same :ref:`member selection logic
<replica-set-read-preference-behavior-member-selection>` to choose a
member to direct read operations to based on read preference mode and
tag sets.

.. index:: read preference; behavior
.. _replica-set-read-preference-behavior:

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 2.2

.. _replica-set-read-preference-behavior-retry:

Auto-Retry
``````````

Connection between MongoDB drivers and :program:`mongod` instances in
a :term:`replica set` must balance two concerns:

#. The client should attempt to prefer current results and any
   connection should read from the same member of the replica set as
   much as possible.

#. The client should minimize the amount of time that the database is
   inaccessible as the result of a connection issue, networking
   problem, or :term:`failover` in a replica set.

As a result, MongoDB drivers and :program:`mongos` will:

- reuse a connection to specific :program:`mongod` for as long as
  possible after establishing a connection to that instance. This
  connection is *pinned* to this :program:`mongod`.

- attempt to reconnect to a new member, obeying existing :ref:`read
  preference mode <replica-set-read-preference-modes>` when it lose a
  connection to its :program:`mongod`.

  These reconnections are transparent to the application itself. If
  the connection permits reads from :term:`secondary` members, after
  reconnecting, the application can receive two sequential reads
  returning from different secondaries. Depending on the state of the
  individual secondary member's replication, the documents can reflect
  the state of your database at different moments.

- return an error *only* after attempting to connect to three members
  of the set that match the :ref:`read preference mode <replica-set-read-preference-modes>`
  and :ref:`tag set <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`.
  If there are fewer than three members of the set, the
  client will error after connecting to all existing members of the
  set.

  After this error, the driver will select a new member using the
  specified read preference mode, or in absence of a specified read
  preference :readmode:`PRIMARY`.

- after detecting a failover situation, [#fn-failover]_ the driver will
  attempt to refresh its state of the replica set as quickly as
  possible.

.. [#fn-failover] When a :term:`failover` occurs, all members of the set
   closes all client connections producing a socket error in the
   driver. This behavior prevents or minimized :term:`rollback`.

.. _replica-set-read-preference-behavior-requests:

Request Length
``````````````

MongoDB assumes that connections between the client and database are
long-lived and that the client will reuse a single connection and
corresponding thread for many operations. When you set a :ref:`read
preference mode <replica-set-read-preference-modes>`, that mode will
persist for all operations that use this thread. A read preference
mode will persist on a per-connection basis until:

- the application sets a new read preference mode, in a new
  operation.

  This behavior permits clients to set read preferences on a per
  operation basis.

- the application (i.e. driver) connection thread goes away, as
  the result of normal application processes.

  Typically this triggers a :ref:`retry
  <replica-set-read-preference-behavior-retry>`, which may be
  transparent to the application.

- the client receives a socket exception, as is the case when
  there's a connection error, or when the :program:`mongod` closes
  connections during a :term:`failover`.

As a result, unless you explicitly set read preference modes on your
connections or operations, read operations may run with unexpected
read preference modes.

Member Selection
````````````````

Clients by way of their drivers, and :program:`mongos` instances for
shard clusters, send periodic "ping," messages to all member of the
replica set to determine latency from the application to each
:program:`mongod` instance.

For any operation that will target a member *other* than the
:term:`primary`, the driver will:

#. assemble a list of suitable members, taking account member type
   (i.e. secondary, primary, or all members.)

#. determine which of these suitable members is the closest to the
   client in absolute terms.

#. build a list of members that are within a defined ping distance (in
   milliseconds) of the "absolute nearest" member. [#acceptable-secondary-latency]_

#. select a member to perform the read operation on from these hosts
   at random.

Once the application selects a member of the set to use for read
operations, the driver will continue to use this connection for read
preference until the application specifies a new read preference or
something interrupts the connection. See ":ref:`replica-set-read-preference-behavior-requests`"
for more information.

.. [#acceptable-secondary-latency] Applications can configure the
   threshold used in this stage. The default "acceptable latency" is
   15 milliseconds. For :program:`mongos` you can use the
   :option:`--localThreshold <mongos --localThreshold>` or
   :setting:`localThreshold` runtime options to set this value.

Sharding and ``mongos``
```````````````````````

.. versionchanged:: 2.2
   Before version 2.2, :program:`mongos` did not support the
   :ref:`read preference mode semantics <replica-set-read-preference-modes>`.

In most :term:`shard clusters <shard cluster>`, a :term:`replica set`
provides each shard, where read preferences are also applicable. Read
operations in a shard cluster, with regard to read preference, are
identical to unsharded replica sets.

Unlike simple replica sets, in shard clusters, all interactions with
the shards pass from the clients to the :program:`mongos` instances
that are actually connected to the set members. :program:`mongos` is
responsible for the application of the read preferences, which is
transparent to applications.

There are no configuration changes required for full support of read
preference modes in sharded environments, as long as the
:program:`mongos` is at least version 2.2. All :program:`mongos`
maintain their own connection pool to the replica set members, as a
result:

- a request without a specified preference will have
  :readmode:`primary`, the default, unless, the :program:`mongos`
  reuses and existing connection that had a different mode set.

  Always explicitly set your read preference mode to prevent
  confusion.

- all :readmode:`nearest` and latency calculations reflect the
  connection between the :program:`mongos` and the :program:`mongod`
  instances, not the client and the :program:`mongod` instances.

  This produces the desired result, because all results must pass
  through the :program:`mongos` before returning to the client.

Database Commands
`````````````````

Because some :term:`database commands <database command>` read and
return data from the database, all of the official drivers support
full :ref:`read preference mode semantics <replica-set-read-preference-modes>`
for the following commands:

- :dbcommand:`group`
- :dbcommand:`mapReduce` [#inline-map-reduce]_
- :dbcommand:`aggregate`
- :dbcommand:`collStats`
- :dbcommand:`dbStats`
- :dbcommand:`count`
- :dbcommand:`distinct`
- :dbcommand:`geoNear`
- :dbcommand:`geoSearch`
- :dbcommand:`geoWalk`

.. [#inline-map-reduce] Only "inline" :dbcommand:`mapReduce`
   operations that do not write data support read preference,
   otherwise these operations must run on the :term:`primary`
   members.
