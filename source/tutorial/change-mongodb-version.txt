downgrade operations between releases of MongoDB while maximizing the
availability of your deployment. MMS supports upgrade and downgrade
operations for :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`,
:term:`replica sets <replica set>`,and :term:`standalone MongoDB
instances <standalone>`.

Considerations
--------------

Before changing a deployment's MongoDB version:

- Consult the following documents for any special considerations or
  application compatibility issues:

  - :manual:`The MongoDB Release Notes </release-notes>`

  - The documentation for your driver.

- Plan the version change during a predefined maintenance window.

- Before changing version on a production environment, change versions on
  a *staging* environment that reproduces your production environment to
  ensure your configuration is compatible with all changes.
