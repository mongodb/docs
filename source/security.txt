.. note::
   Databases hosted on MongoDB Atlas are secure by default. Atlas encrypts your
   data, both in-transit and at-rest, and makes it easy to control access with
   role-based user management. `Set up a free cluster now

MongoDB provides various features, such as authentication, access
control, encryption, to secure your MongoDB deployments. Some key
security features include:
