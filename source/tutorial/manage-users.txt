Overview
--------

To access a |mms| organization or the project within that organization,
a |mms| user must be a member of that organization. Depending on the
user's :ref:`role in the organization <organization-roles>`, the |mms|
user may be required to be a member of the project as well to access a
project.

If a |mms| user is a member of a project, the user's access to the
project is determined by the user's :ref:`project role <project-roles>`.

A user can be a member of multiple projects and multiple organizations.

.. note::

   |mms| users are separate from :doc:`MongoDB users
   </tutorial/manage-mongodb-users>`.

Manage Organization Users
-------------------------

Add Users to an Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add users to an :doc:`organization
</tutorial/manage-organizations>`, you must have the :authrole:`Organization
Owner` role for the organization.

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/steps/add-user-org.rst

.. only:: cloud

   If the console finds a connected Jira account, |mms| will automatically
   add the user to your Jira group and the |mms| console.

   Users can also create accounts using the `account registration page
   <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/register/user>`_, or through Jira at
   `jira.mongodb.org <http://jira.mongodb.org/>`_.

   .. index:: users; propagation

   .. note::

      If you create an account in Jira or make any changes to that
      account from *within* Jira, it can take up to 30 minutes for that
      change to propagate to |mms|. During this window you cannot add a
      user to a project in |mms|. Also, passwords changed in Jira are subject
      to the same propagation delay for |mms| accounts.

.. only:: onprem

   Users can create accounts using the account registration page of
   your |mms| installation if |mms| configuration is not
   :setting:`Invitation Only Mode`. If the |mms| is in
   :setting:`setting:: Invitation Only Mode`, new users can register only
   by invitation. The invitation provides a URL that displays the
   registration link.

View Organization Users

To view users for a project, click on the organization's
:guilabel:`Settings`, then :guilabel:`Users`.

The page lists users who are members of your |mms| organization.

The page also lists pending users who have not yet replied to the
invitation to join the organization or project within the organization.

View Organization Invitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you invite a user to join an organization or a project, |mms| then
sends an email to the prospective new user. To view pending users for
an organization, click on the organization's :guilabel:`Settings`, then
:guilabel:`Users`. The page lists any users with pending invitations.
To cancel an invitation, click on the trash can icon.

Edit Organization User's Role

:authrole:`Organization Owner` role for the organization.

To edit roles through |mms|, for the organization:

   click on the checkmark to save.

A user can request to join a project when first registering for |mms|.

Add Users to a Project
