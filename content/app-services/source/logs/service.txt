Overview
--------

Service logs are created by whenever a user interacts with
:doc:`External Services </reference/services>`. The fields present in 
Service log entries are determined by the service that emitted the log.

MongoDB Atlas
-------------

:doc:`MongoDB Atlas </mongodb>` is offered as a first-class service
within Atlas App Services. Service log entries have the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "arguments": [
      {
        "collection": <collection>,
        "database": <database>,
        "query": <query document>,
        "limit": {
          "$numberInt": <number>
        }
      }
    ],
    "name": <action>,
    "service": "mongodb-atlas"
   }

   Function Call Location: <location>

   Compute Used: <number> bytes•ms

   Remote IP Address: <ip address>

   SDK: <sdk>>

   Platform Version: <version>

   Rule Performance Metrics:
   {
    "database.collection": {
      "roles": {
        "owner": {
          "matching_documents": 5,
          "evaluated_fields": 0,
          "discarded_fields": 0
        }
      },
      "no_matching_role": 0
      }
   }

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 50

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - Remote IP Address
     - The IP Address that sent the request to App Services. (e.g. ``52.21.89.200``)

       For a browser, this is ``<browser> <SDK version>``.

       .. example::

          This request came from the Realm Web SDK version 4.0.0
          running on Mozilla Firefox:

          .. code-block:: none

              SDK: firefox v4.0.0

          This request came from the Realm Java SDK version 4.6.0 running
          on Android Marshmallow:

          .. code-block:: none

              SDK: android v4.6.0

   * - Function Call Location
     - The data center in which the function was executed.

   * - Rule Performance Metrics
     - A summary of the :ref:`roles <roles>`,
       :ref:`schemas <schemas>`, and :ref:`filters <filters>`
       applied to a return value. Provides the number of documents that a role
       applies to as well as the number of fields in those documents that App Services
       evaluated and potentially withheld.
