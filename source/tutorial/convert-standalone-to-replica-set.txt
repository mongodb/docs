Convert a Standalone Self-Managed mongod to a Replica Set

   :description: Convert a standalone mongod to a replica set for production, ensuring redundancy. Check security before exposing the cluster.

A :term:`standalone` :binary:`mongod` instance is useful for testing and
development. A standalone instance isn't a good choice for a production
deployment because it can be a single point of failure. A :ref:`replica
set <replication>`, also known as a *cluster*, provides redundancy and
availability. Always use a replica set in production.

If you have a standalone server with data that you want to use in
production, convert the standalone server to a replica set first. 

.. important::

   If you convert a development server to a replica set for production
   use, consult the :ref:`security checklist <security-checklist>`
   before you expose your cluster to the internet. 

You can easily migrate from a standalone server
to a `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas>`__ cluster.
MongoDB Atlas is the fully managed service for MongoDB deployments in
the cloud. To learn more, see `Migrate or Import Data 
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/import/>`__ in the {+atlas+}
documentation.

About This Task
---------------

Server Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial uses the following servers:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Hostname
     - Port
     - Description

   * - ``mongodb0.example.net``
     - ``27017``
     - A running standalone MongoDB Server with data.

   * - ``mongodb1.example.net``
     - ``27017``
     - A new MongoDB Server to join the replica set.

   * - ``mongodb2.example.net``
     - ``27017``
     - A new MongoDB Server to join the replica set.

Before You Begin
----------------

Cluster Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you convert your standalone instance, consider whether a
:ref:`replica set <replication>` or a :ref:`sharded cluster
<sharding-background>` is more appropriate for your workload.

A sharded cluster is a special kind of cluster. A sharded cluster
provides redundancy and availability; it also distributes data across
:ref:`shards <shards-concepts>`. Shards are usually hosted on multiple
servers and allow for horizontal scaling.

Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use authorization with a replica set, you must also configure
replica set members to use X.509 certificates or keyfiles to
perform internal authentication.

For more information, see:

- :ref:`x509-internal-authentication`
- :ref:`deploy-repl-set-with-keyfile`

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Shut down the standalone instance.

      Use :binary:`mongosh` to :ref:`connect <mdb-shell-connect>` to
      your existing ``mongod`` instance:

      .. code-block:: shell

         mongosh "mongodb://mongodb0.example.net:27017"

      Switch to the ``admin`` database and run :dbcommand:`shutdown`.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         use admin
         db.adminCommand( 
            {
               shutdown: 1,
               comment: "Convert to cluster"
            }
         )      

   .. step:: Configure Replica Set Members

      Update the configuration file on each server and to set
      the :setting:`~replication.replSetName` setting.

      .. code-block:: yaml

         replication:
           replSetName: "rs0"

   .. step:: Configure Member Authentication

      .. include:: /includes/configure-rs-members 

   .. step:: Start MongoDB
   
      Start :program:`mongod` for each member.

   .. step:: Initialize the replica set.
    
       To initialize the replica set, use ``mongosh`` to reconnect to
       your server instance. 

       .. code-block:: shell

          mongosh "mongodb://mongodb0.example.net:27017"

       Then, run the :method:`rs.initiate` method:

       .. code-block:: javascript

          rs.initiate()

       You only have to initiate the replica set once.

       To view the replica set configuration, use :method:`rs.conf()`.
       
       To check the status of the replica set, use :method:`rs.status()`.

   .. step:: Add nodes to the replica set.

      The new replica set has a single, primary node. The next step is
      to add new nodes to the replica set. Review the documentation on
      clusters before you add additional nodes:

      - :ref:`Replica set architectures
        <replica-set-deployment-overview>`
      - :ref:`Adding members to a replica set
        <server-replica-set-deploy-expand>`

      To add nodes, run the :method:`rs.add` method:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.add("mongodb1.example.net:27017")
         rs.add("mongodb2.example.net:27017")

   .. step:: Check replication status.

      To check that the replica set is correctly configured, run
      the :method:`rs.status` method and check that the new
      members are listed in the :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members`
      field:

      .. code-block:: javscript

         rs.status()

   .. step:: Update Your Application Connection String.

      After you convert the standalone server to a replica set,
      update the :ref:`connection string <mongodb-uri>` used by
      your applications to the connection string for your
      replica set:

      - ``mongodb0.example.net:27017``
      - ``mongodb1.example.net:27017`` 
      - ``mongodb2.example.net:27017``

      .. code-block:: none

         mongodb://mongodb0.example.net:27017,mongodb1.example.net:27017,mongodb2.example.net:27017

      Then, restart your applications.
