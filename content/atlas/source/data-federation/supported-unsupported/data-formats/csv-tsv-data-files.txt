   :description: Understand how Atlas Data Federation processes CSV and TSV files, using header rows for field names and creating nested JSON structures.

Your :abbr:`CSV (Comma Separated Values)` or :abbr:`TSV (Tab Separated 
Values)` file must start with a header row. {+adf+} utilizes the 
header row as field names. The dot-delimited field names in the header 
row become nested fields or objects in |json| format. For each dot in 
the field name, {+df+} creates another level of nesting.

.. example::

   Suppose your {+fdi+} is reading a CSV file with content 
   similar to the following:

   .. code-block:: text
      :copyable: false

      company,location.state,location.city.name,location.city.street
      "MongoDB", "California", "Palo Alto", "Forest Ave"

   For the data fields in the above example CSV file, {+df+} 
   creates the following |json| document:

   .. code-block:: json 
      :copyable: false

      {
         "company": "MongoDB",
         "location": { 
            "state": "California",
            "city": {
               "name": "Palo Alto",
               "street": "Forest Ave",
         }
      }

{+df+} requires all field names at the same level of nesting 
to be unique. The following are examples of invalid field names 
in the header row:

- One field duplicates another field at the same level of nesting. 

  .. example::

     Consider the following:

     .. code-block:: text
        :copyable: false

        company,location,company

     In the header, ``company`` is included twice at the same level of 
     nesting. 

- One dot-delimited field duplicates another field at the same level 
  of nesting. 

  .. example:: 
   
     Consider the following:

     .. code-block:: text
        :copyable: false

        company,location,location.city

     In the header, ``location`` is both a stand-alone field 
     and dot-delimited field at the same level of nesting.
