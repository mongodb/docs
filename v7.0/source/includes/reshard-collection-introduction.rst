In a collection resharding operation, a shard can be a:

- **donor**, which currently stores :term:`chunks <chunk>` for the
  sharded collection.
- **recipient**, which stores new chunks for the sharded collection
  based on the :term:`shard keys <shard key>` and :ref:`zones
  <zone-sharding>`.

A shard can be donor and a recipient at the same time. The set of donor
shards is identical to the recipient shards, unless you use zones.

The config server primary is always the resharding coordinator and
starts each phase of the resharding operation.
