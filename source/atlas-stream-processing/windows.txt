{+atlas-sp+} windows are :ref:`aggregation pipeline stages
<atlas-sp-aggregation-support>` that capture time-bounded subsets of a
data stream, allowing you to perform operations that require finite
inputs on streaming data.

Consider the example stream processor described :manual:`here
</reference/method/sp.createStreamProcessor/#example>`. The
:pipeline:`$match` stage can operate directly on the stream of data
pulled in by :pipeline:`$source`, checking each document against the
match criteria as the stream processor ingests it.

By contrast, the :pipeline:`$group` stage and the various statistical
computations contained within it cannot operate on unbounded data, as
it is impossible to determine minimum, maximum, average, or median
values without first bounding the set of values to consider. Many
non-mathematical operators such as :manual:`$push
</reference/operator/aggregation/push>` and :manual:`$top
</reference/operator/aggregation/top>` also require bounded data.

A stream processor provides these bounds with a window. A window
opens, and all documents that the stream processor ingests accumulate
in that window's state until a predefined interval of time elapses and
the window closes. The window batches all documents it captures during
that interval, and passes this set through its internal pipeline. From
within this pipeline, the batched documents are indistinguishable from
data-at-rest.

{+atlas-sp+} provides support for :ref:`tumbling-windows` and 
:ref:`hopping-windows`.

.. _tumbling-windows:

Tumbling Windows
----------------

**Tumbling windows** are windows defined entirely by the time
intervals they capture. These time intervals don't overlap.

.. example:: 
   
   You define a tumbling window with an interval of 3 seconds.
   When you start your stream processor:
   
   - A window opens for 3 seconds.
   - The first window captures all documents that the stream generates 
     within those 3 seconds. 
   - After 3 seconds elapse, the window closes and applies your 
     aggregation logic to all the documents in that window. 

     If you configure ``allowedLateness``, {+atlas-sp+} writes
     late-arriving messages to the :ref:`<atlas-sp-dlq>` after the close
     of the window. 

   - A new window opens as soon as the first one closes and captures 
     documents from the stream for the next 3 seconds.

Tumbling windows ensure comprehensive capture of data streams without 
repeated processing of individual documents.

.. _hopping-windows:

Hopping Windows
---------------

**Hopping windows** are windows defined by the time interval they 
capture and the interval between opening each window, called the 
**hop**. Since duration is decoupled from frequency, you can configure
hopping windows to overlap or to space themselves apart.

To define a hopping window with overlap, set a hop smaller than the
interval.

.. example:: 

   You define a hopping window with an interval of 20 seconds and a hop
   of 5 seconds. When you start your stream processor:

   - A window opens for 20 seconds. 
   - The first window captures all documents that the stream generates
     within those 20 seconds.
   - 5 seconds later, another window opens and captures all documents
     within the next 20 seconds. Because the first window is still 
     open, all documents that the stream generates for the next 15 
     seconds are captured by both windows.
   - 20 seconds after the first window opened, it closes and applies 
     your aggregation logic to all the documents in that window. 
   - 5 seconds later, the second window closes and applies your 
     aggregation logic to all the documents in that window, *including* 
     those that were already subject to aggregation logic in the first 
     window.

   If you configure ``allowedLateness``, {+atlas-sp+} writes
   late-arriving messages to the :ref:`<atlas-sp-dlq>` after the close
   of the window. 

To define a hopping window with spacing, set a hop larger than the
interval.

.. example::

   You define a hopping window with an interval of 3 seconds and a hop 
   of 5 seconds. When you start a stream processor: 
   
   - A window opens for 3 seconds.
   - The first window captures all documents for the next 3 seconds. 
   - After 3 seconds elapse, the window closes and applies your 
     aggregation logic to all the documents in that window.
   - The next window opens after a further 2 seconds elapse.
   - {+atlas-sp+} does not process any documents that the stream 
     generates during those 2 seconds.

.. _atlas-sp-timing:

Stream Processing Timing
------------------------

In streaming data processing, documents are subject to two timing
systems, event time and processing time. See below to learn more.

{+atlas-sp+} offers various mechanisms which change window behavior to
mitigate these issues.

.. _atlas-sp-event-time:

Event Time
~~~~~~~~~~

Event time is the time at which either the source stream generates a 
document, or the messaging system (e.g. {+kafka+}) receives the document.
This is ascertained by the timestamp of the document.

Network latency, upstream processing, and other factors can not only
cause discrepancies between these times for a given document, but can
also cause documents to arrive in a stream processor out of event-time
order. In either case, windows can miss documents that you intend for
them to capture. {+atlas-sp+} considers such documents
**late-arriving**, and sends them to your :ref:`Dead Letter Queue
<atlas-sp-dlq>` if you configure one.

**Event Time windows** is a configurable option for the 
``boundary`` field supported in :ref:`Tumbling Windows <tumbling-windows>` 
and :ref:`Hopping Windows <hopping-windows>`.

.. _atlas-sp-watermark:

Watermarks
```````````

A watermark supersedes :ref:`processing time <atlas-sp-processing-time>` and 
updates only when the processor consumes a document with a later event time 
than any previously-consumed document. All stream processors apply watermarks
in {+atlas-sp+}.

.. _atlas-sp-watermark-example:

Example
++++++++

You configure a stream processor with 5-minute windows. You start the
processor at ``12:00``, so that the first two windows will have
durations of ``12:00-12:05`` and ``12:05-12:10``. The following table
illustrates which windows will capture which events given varying
delays, with and without watermarks.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 30 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Event Time
     - Processing Time
     - Window Time (No Watermarks)
     - Window Time (Watermarks)

   * - 12:00
     - 12:00

     - 12:00-12:05

     - 12:00-12:05

   * - 12:03

     - 12:00-12:05
     - 12:00-12:05

   * - 12:02
     - 12:05
     - 12:05-12:10
     - 12:00-12:05

   * - 12:01
     - 12:06
     - 12:05-12:10
     - 12:00-12:05

   * - 12:04
     - 12:06
     - 12:05-12:10
     - 12:00-12:05

   * - 12:05
     - 12:07
     - 12:00-12:05
     - 12:05-12:10

   * - 12:06
     - 12:07
     - 12:05-12:10
     - 12:05-12:10

   * - 12:06
     - 12:08
     - 12:05-12:10
     - 12:05-12:10

In the scenario where watermarks don't apply, the ``12:00-12:05``
window closes at ``12:05`` according to the system clock of the
{+spi+}, and the ``12:05-12:10`` window opens immediately. As a
result, though the source generated seven of the documents during the
``12:00-12:05`` interval, the relevant window captures only four
documents.

In the scenario where watermarks do apply, the ``12:00-12:05`` window
doesn't close at ``12:05`` because among the documents it ingests up
to that point, the latest event time—and thus the watermark value—is
``12:03``. The ``12:00-12:05`` window doesn't close until ``12:07`` on
the system clock, when the stream processor ingests a document with an
event time of ``12:05``, advances the watermark to that time, and opens
the ``12:05-12:10`` window. Each window captures all of the appropriate
documents.

When reading from {+kafka+}, |service| waits for all partitions to pass the watermark.
If a partition idles and fails to produce events with timestamps later than the 
watermark, the window doesn't close or output results. 
To address this, set ``partitionIdleTimeout`` to ensure that idle partitions 
do not halt the progression of watermarks. To learn more, see :ref:`streams-agg-pipeline-source`.

.. _atlas-sp-allowed-late:

Allowed Lateness
`````````````````

If the differences between event time and processing time vary
sufficiently, documents may arrive in a stream processor after the
watermark has advanced enough to close the expected window. To
mitigate this, {+atlas-sp+} supports Allowed Lateness, a setting which
delays a window closing by a set interval relative to the watermark.

While watermarks are properties of stream processors, Allowed Lateness
is a property of a window, and only affects when that window
closes. If the stream processor's watermark advances to a point that
would trigger a new window to open, Allowed Lateness keeps earlier
windows open without preventing this.

Example
++++++++

You configure a stream processor with 5-minute tumbling windows. You
start the processor at ``12:00``, so that the first two windows will
have durations of ``12:00-12:05`` and ``12:05-12:10``. You set an
Allowed Lateness of 2 minutes.

The table below reflects the order in which the stream processor ingests
the described documents.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 22 22 22 34 
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Event Time
     - Watermark
     - Allowed Lateness Time

   * - 12:00
     - 12:00
     - 11:58
     - 12:00-12:05

   * - 12:01
     - 12:01
     - 11:59
     - 12:00-12:05

   * - 12:03
     - 12:03
     - 12:01
     - 12:00-12:05

   * - 12:02
     - 12:03
     - 12:01
     - 12:00-12:05

   * - 12:04
     - 12:04
     - 12:02
     - 12:00-12:05

   * - 12:01
     - 12:04
     - 12:02
     - 12:00-12:05

   * - 12:05
     - 12:05
     - 12:03
     - 12:00-12:15, 12:05-12:10

   * - 12:06
     - 12:06
     - 12:04
     - 12:00-12:05, 12:05-12:10

   * - 12:04
     - 12:06
     - 12:04
     - 12:00-12:05, 12:05-12:10

   * - 12:07
     - 12:07
     - 12:05
     - 12:05-12:10

When the watermark advances to ``12:05``, the ``12:05-12:10`` window
opens. However, because the Allowed Lateness interval is 2 minutes,
from within the ``12:00-12:05`` window, it is effectively only
``12:03``, so it stays open. Only when the watermark advances to
``12:07`` does the adjusted time reach ``12:05``. At this point, the
``12:00-12:05`` window closes.

.. _atlas-sp-idle-timeout:

Idleness Timeout
`````````````````

Decoupling windowing behavior from processing time by default improves
stream processing correctness in most cases. However, a streaming data
source may have periods of extended idleness. In this scenario, a
window may capture events prior to the period of idleness and be unable
to return processed results while waiting for the watermark to advance
enough to close.

{+atlas-sp+} allows users to configure an idleness timeout for windows
to mitigate these scenarios using processing time. An idleness timeout
is an interval of time that begins when processing time passes the end
of an open window's interval, and the stream processor's source is
idle. If the source remains idle for an interval equal to the idleness
timeout, the window closes and the watermark advances independent of
any document ingestion.

Example
++++++++

You configure a tumbling window with a 3-minute interval and a
1-minute idleness timeout. The following table illustrates the effects
of the idleness timeout during and after a window's interval.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 22 34 22 22 
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Processing Time
     - Event Time or Status
     - Watermark
     - Window Time

   * - 12:00
     - 12:00
     - 12:00
     - 12:00-12:03

   * - 12:01
     - Source idle
     - 12:00
     - 12:00-12:03

   * - 12:02
     - Source idle
     - 12:00
     - 12:00-12:03

   * - 12:03
     - Source idle
     - 12:00
     - 12:00-12:03

   * - 12:04
     - 12:02
     - 12:02
     - 12:00-12:03

   * - 12:05
     - 12:05
     - 12:05
     - 12:03-12:06

   * - 12:06
     - Source idle
     - 12:05
     - 12:03-12:06

   * - 12:07
     - Source idle
     - 12:00
     - 12:06-12:09

   * - 12:08
     - Source idle
     - 12:00
     - 12:06-12:09

   * - 12:09
     - 12:09
     - 12:09
     - 12:09-12:12

During the ``12:00-12:03`` interval, the source idles for three
minutes, but the stream processor doesn't close the window because
processing time is not past the end of the window's interval, and the
source does not remain idle after the window's interval ends. When the
watermark advances to ``12:05``, the window closes normally, and the
``12:03-12:06`` window opens.

When the source goes idle at ``12:06``, it remains idle through
``12:07``, triggering the idleness timeout and advancing the watermark
to ``12:06``.

.. _atlas-sp-processing-time:

Processing Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Processing time is the time at which the stream processor consumes a 
document. This is ascertained by the clock of the system hosting the 
stream processor.

**Processing Time windows** is a configurable option for the 
``boundary`` field supported in :ref:`Tumbling Windows <tumbling-windows>` 
and :ref:`Hopping Windows <hopping-windows>`. It allows you to create a 
pipeline with a kind of window which accumulates data based on the wall 
clock time of the server. As opposed to windows that work with 
:ref:`event time <atlas-sp-event-time>`, processing time windows assign 
each event a timestamp based on the wall clock time of the server at 
the time it arrives at the stream processor.

Document timestamps and window boundary timestamps are in |utc|. 
You can't specify ``idleTimeout`` or ``allowedLateness`` options 
when configuring a ``processingTime`` window.

.. example:: 
   
   You create a pipeline with a 5 minute event time window. An event is added 
   to a source Kafka cluster at ``09:33``. Due to some delay in the Kafka 
   cluster, it arrives at the stream processor at ``09:37``.

   If the pipeline has a 5 minute event time window, then this event will be 
   assigned to the ``09:30-09:35`` window. If the pipeline has a 5 minute 
   processing time window, then the event will instead be assigned to the 
   ``09:35-09:40`` window.
