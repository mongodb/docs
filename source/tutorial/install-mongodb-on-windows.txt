.. admonition:: Platform Support

   Starting in version 2.2, MongoDB does not support Windows XP. Please
   use a more recent version of Windows to use more recent releases of
   MongoDB.

.. important:: If you are running any edition of Windows Server 2008
   R2 or Windows 7, please install `a hotfix to resolve an issue with
   memory mapped files on Windows <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2731284>`_.

Download MongoDB for Windows
----------------------------

There are three builds of MongoDB for Windows:

- MongoDB for Windows Server 2008 R2 edition (i.e. 2008R2)
  only runs on Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7 64-bit, and newer
  versions of Windows. This build takes advantage of recent
  enhancements to the Windows Platform and cannot operate on older
  versions of Windows.

- MongoDB for Windows 64-bit runs on any 64-bit version of Windows
  newer than Windows XP, including Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows
  7 64-bit.

- MongoDB for Windows 32-bit runs on any 32-bit version of Windows
  newer than Windows XP. 32-bit versions of MongoDB are only intended
  for older systems and for use in testing and development systems.
  32-bit versions of MongoDB only support databases smaller than 2GB.

.. tip::

   To find which version of Windows you are running, enter the
   following command in the :guilabel:`Command Prompt`:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      wmic os get osarchitecture

#. Download the latest production release of MongoDB from the `MongoDB
   downloads page <http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>`_. Ensure you
   download the correct version of MongoDB for your Windows system. The
   64-bit versions of MongoDB will not work with 32-bit Windows.

#. Extract the downloaded archive.

   a. In Windows Explorer, find the MongoDB download file, typically in
      the default ``Downloads`` directory.

   #. Extract the archive to ``C:\`` by right clicking on the archive
      and selecting :guilabel:`Extract All` and browsing to ``C:\``.

#. Optional. Move the MongoDB directory to another location. For
   example, to move the directory to ``C:\mongodb`` directory:

   a. Go :guilabel:`Start Menu` > :guilabel:`All Programs` >
      :guilabel:`Accessories`.

   #. Right click :guilabel:`Command Prompt`, and select :guilabel:`Run
      as Administrator` from the popup menu.

   #. In the :guilabel:`Command Prompt`, issue the following commands:

      .. code-block:: powershell

         cd \
         move C:\mongodb-win32-* C:\mongodb

.. note::

   MongoDB is self-contained and does not have any other system
   dependencies. You can run MongoDB from any folder you choose. You
   may install MongoDB in any directory (e.g. ``D:\test\mongodb``)

Run MongoDB
-----------

.. _set-up-data-directory:

Set Up the Data Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB requires a :term:`data folder <dbpath>` to store its files. The
default location for the MongoDB data directory is ``C:\data\db``.
Create this folder using the :guilabel:`Command Prompt`. Go to the
``C:\`` directory and issue the following command sequence:

.. code-block:: powershell

   md data
   md data\db

You can specify an alternate path for data files using the
:option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option to :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe`.

Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start MongoDB, execute from the :guilabel:`Command Prompt`:

.. code-block:: powershell

   C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe

This will start the main MongoDB database process. The ``waiting for
connections`` message in the console output indicates that the
mongod.exe process is running successfully.

.. note::

   Depending on the security level of your system, Windows will issue
   a :guilabel:`Security Alert` dialog box about blocking "some
   features" of ``C:\\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe`` from communicating on
   networks. All users should select ``Private Networks, such as my
   home or work network`` and click ``Allow access``. For additional
   information on security and MongoDB, please read the
   :doc:`/core/security` page.

.. warning::

   Do not allow :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` to be accessible to public
   networks without running in "Secure Mode" (i.e. :setting:`auth`.)
   MongoDB is designed to be run in "trusted environments" and the
   database does not enable authentication or "Secure Mode" by
   default.

You may specify an alternate path for ``\data\db`` with the
:setting:`dbpath` setting for :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe`, as in the
following example:

.. code-block:: powershell

   C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --dbpath d:\test\mongodb\data

If your path includes spaces, enclose the entire path in double
quotations, for example:

.. code-block:: powershell

   C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --dbpath "d:\test\mongo db data"

Connect to MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connect to MongoDB using the :binary:`~bin.mongo.exe <mongo>` shell. Open another
:guilabel:`Command Prompt` and issue the following command:

.. code-block:: powershell

   C:\mongodb\bin\mongo.exe

.. note::

   Executing the command ``start C:\mongodb\bin\mongo.exe`` will
   automatically start the :binary:`~bin.mongo.exe` shell in a separate
   :guilabel:`Command Prompt` window.

The :binary:`~bin.mongo.exe <mongo>` shell will connect to :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` running on
the localhost interface and port ``27017`` by default. At the
:binary:`~bin.mongo.exe <mongo>` prompt, issue the following two commands to
insert a record in the ``test`` :term:`collection` of the default
``test`` database and then retrieve that record:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.test.save( { a: 1 } )
   db.test.find()

.. seealso:: :binary:`~bin.mongo` and :doc:`/reference/method`. If
   you want to develop applications using .NET, see the documentation
   of :ecosystem:`C# and MongoDB </drivers/csharp>` for more
   information.

.. _tutorial-mongod-as-windows-service:

MongoDB as a Windows Service
----------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0

You can set up MongoDB as a :guilabel:`Windows Service` so that the
database will start automatically following each reboot cycle.

.. note::

   :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` added support for running as a Windows
   service in version 2.0, and :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` added support for
   running as a Windows Service in version 2.1.1.

Configure the System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps, although optional, are good practice.

You should specify two options when running MongoDB as a Windows
Service: a path for the log output (i.e. :setting:`logpath`) and a
:doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>`.

#. Optional. Create a specific directory for MongoDB log files:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      md C:\mongodb\log

#. Optional. Create a configuration file for the :setting:`logpath` option for
   MongoDB in the :guilabel:`Command Prompt` by issuing this command:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      echo logpath=C:\mongodb\log\mongo.log > C:\mongodb\mongod.cfg

.. note::

   Consider setting the :setting:`logappend` option. If you do not,
   :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` will delete the contents of the existing log
   file when starting.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      The default :setting:`logpath` and :setting:`logappend` behavior
      changed in the 2.2 release.

Install and Run the MongoDB Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run all of the following commands in :guilabel:`Command Prompt` with
"Administrative Privileges:"

#. To install the MongoDB service:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --config C:\mongodb\mongod.cfg --install

   Modify the path to the ``mongod.cfg`` file as needed. For the
   :option:`--install <mongod.exe --install>` option to succeed, you *must* specify a
   :setting:`logpath` setting or the :option:`--logpath <mongod --logpath>`
   run-time option.

#. To run the MongoDB service:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      net start MongoDB

If you wish to use an alternate path for your :setting:`dbpath`
specify it in the config file (e.g. ``C:\mongodb\mongod.cfg``) on
that you specified in the :option:`--install <mongod.exe --install>`
operation. You may also specify :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`
on the command line; however, always prefer the configuration file.

If you have not set up the data directory, :ref:`set up the data
directory <set-up-data-directory>` where MongoDB will store its data
files. If the :setting:`dbpath` directory does not exist,
:binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` will not be able to start. The default value for
:setting:`dbpath` is ``\data\db``.

Stop or Remove the MongoDB Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To stop the MongoDB service:

.. code-block:: powershell

   net stop MongoDB

To remove the MongoDB service:

.. code-block:: powershell

   C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --remove
