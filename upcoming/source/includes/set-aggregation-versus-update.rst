In this pipeline, ``$set`` and ``$unset`` are aggregation stages, as
opposed to update operators. The aggregation stages :pipeline:`$set` and
:pipeline:`$unset` add new fields to documents and do not modify
existing field values.

For more information on the update operators, see :update:`$set` and
:update:`$unset`.
