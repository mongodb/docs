============================
Replace a Replica Set Member
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Use this procedure to replace a member of a replica set when the hostname
has changed. This procedure preserves all existing configuration
for a member, except its hostname/location.

You may need to replace a replica set member if you want to replace an
existing system and only need to change the hostname rather than
completely replace all configured options related to the previous
member.

Use :method:`rs.reconfig()` to change the value of the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].host` field to reflect the new hostname or port
number. :method:`rs.reconfig()` will not change the value of
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n]._id`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].host = "mongo2.example.net:27019"
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

.. warning::

   Any replica set configuration change can trigger the current
   :term:`primary` to step down, which forces an :ref:`election <replica-set-elections>`. This
   causes the current shell session, and clients connected to this replica set,
   to produce an error even when the operation succeeds.
