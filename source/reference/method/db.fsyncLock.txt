Definition
----------

.. method:: db.fsyncLock()

   Forces the :program:`mongod` to flush all pending write operations to
   disk and locks the *entire* :program:`mongod` instance to prevent
   additional writes until the user releases the lock with the
   :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` command. :method:`db.fsyncLock()` is an
   administrative command.

   This command provides a simple wrapper around a
   :dbcommand:`fsync` database command with the following
   syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { fsync: 1, lock: true }

   This function locks the database and creates a window for
   :doc:`backup operations </core/backups>`.

Impact on Read Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:method:`db.fsyncLock()` *may* block reads, including those necessary to
verify authentication.
Such reads are necessary to establish new connections to a
:program:`mongod` that enforces authorization checks.

Connection
~~~~~~~~~~

When calling :method:`db.fsyncLock()`, ensure that the connection
is kept open to allow a subsequent call to :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()`.

Closing the connection may make it difficult to release the
lock.
