Calculated fields are JavaScript expressions that let you create new
fields based on relational source columns. You can use calculated fields
to transform your relational database source columns into customized
MongoDB fields.

Use Cases
---------

You can use calculated fields to perform the following actions:

- Modify string values

- Split or concatenate fields

- Perform arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction

Behavior
--------

You can use JavaScript code in a calculated field.

You cannot use third-party JavaScript libraries in calculated fields.

Calculated fields have the following characteristics:

- They are optionally added to the list of fields belonging to a mapping
  rule.

- They only access data from a table row's column values.

- They serve as a transformation layer as you migrate your data to
  MongoDB.
