  - ``must`` clause to search for movie titles that begin 
    with the term ``allè`` using the :ref:`wildcard-ref` operator
  - ``should`` clause to specify preference for the ``Drama`` genre
    using the :ref:`text-ref` operator

  The query uses the :pipeline:`$project` stage to:
  
  - Exclude all fields except ``title`` and ``genres``
  - Add a field named ``score``

  The wildcard search for ``allè`` returns documents where the 
  ``title`` field starts with ``alle`` even though it doesn't include 
  any diacritics, because the ``diacriticsFolder`` custom analyzer we 
  used on the ``title`` field applied character folding on its values. |fts| 
  returns documents with titles that begin with the query term ``allè`` 
  because we used the keyword tokenizer, which tokenizes entire strings 
  (or phrases) as a single token.

  Alternatively, you can specify the standard tokenizer instead of the
  keyword tokenizer in the custom analyzer used on the title field. For
  the standard tokenizer, the |fts| results would contain documents with
  titles that begin or appear anywhere at the beginning of the word for
  the query term ``allè`` such as "Desde allè". To test this, edit your
  :ref:`index definition <diacratic-insensitive-index>` to replace the
  ``keyword`` tokenizer on line 17 with the ``standard`` tokenizer, save the
  index definition, and run the sample query.
