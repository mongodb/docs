  {{operationName}} includes all fields by default, except
  :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet` :data:`~serverStatus.rangeDeleter`,
  and some content in the :data:`~serverStatus.repl` document.

  .. note::

     You may only dynamically include top-level fields from the
     :doc:`serverStatus </reference/command/serverStatus>` document
     that are not included by default. You can exclude any field that
     {{operationName}} includes by default.
