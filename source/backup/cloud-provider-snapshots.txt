|service| Cloud Provider Snapshots provide localized backup storage
using the native snapshot functionality of the cluster's cloud service
provider.

|service| only supports cloud provider snapshots for
:ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>` or
:ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>` backed clusters. A
project using the |service| Cloud Provider Snapshots
*cannot* create snapshots of any cluster hosted
on :ref:`Google Cloud Provider (GCP) <google-gcp>`.

You can enable cloud provider snapshots during the
:doc:`cluster creation </create-new-cluster>` or during the
:doc:`modification of an existing cluster </scale-cluster>`.
From the cluster configuration modal, toggle
``Do you want to enable backup?`` to ``Yes`` and select the
:guilabel:`Cloud Provider Snapshots` card.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/backup-selection-cloud-provider.rst


.. note::

   |service| supports Cloud Provider Snapshots for sharded clusters
   running MongoDB version 3.4+ with the following limitations:

   * |service| does not guarantee :ref:`causal consistency <causal-consistency>`
     of your data.

   * You cannot restore an existing snapshot to a cluster after you
     change that cluster's topology by adding or removing a shard.
     However, you can restore an existing snapshot to another cluster
     with a matching topology.

   * You cannot :manual:`manually migrate chunks </tutorial/migrate-chunks-in-sharded-cluster>`
     in a cluster during a snapshot without the risk of creating an
     inconsistent shapshot.

Cloud Provider Snapshots with Encryption at Rest
------------------------------------------------

|service| encrypts all snapshot volumes, ensuring the security of
cluster data at rest (Encryption at Rest). For projects and clusters
using :ref:`security-kms-encryption`, |service| applies an additional
layer of encryption to your snapshot storage volumes using the 
Key Management Service (KMS) provider configured for the cluster.

.. tabs::

   tabs:

   - id: aws-kms

     name: "AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)"

     content: |

       For clusters using :doc:`AWS IAM </security-aws-kms>` as their
       Key Management Service, |service| uses the project's 
       customer master key (CMK) and AWS 
       :abbr:`IAM (Identity and Access Management)` user credentials at 
       the time of the snapshot to automatically encrypt the snapshot 
       data files. This is an additional layer of encryption on the 
       existing encryption applied to all |service| storage and snapshot 
       volumes.

       |service| stores the unique ID of the 
       :abbr:`CMK (customer master key)` and the AWS 
       :abbr:`IAM (Identity and Access Management)` user credentials 
       used to access the :abbr:`CMK (customer master key)`. |service| 
       uses this information when restoring the snapshot. For complete 
       documentation on restoring an encrypted snapshot, 
       see :ref:`restore-encrypted-snapshot`.

       To view the key used to encrypt a snapshot:

       #. From the :guilabel:`Clusters` view of the |service| UI, click 
          on the cluster name.

       #. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then click 
          :guilabel:`Snapshots`.

       #. Note the :guilabel:`Encryption Key ID` for each snapshot in 
          the cluster. |service| lists the 
          :abbr:`CMK (Customer Master Key)` used to encrypt the 
          snapshot. Unencrypted snapshots display
          :guilabel:`Not enabled`.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-encrypted-backups-master-key-requirements.rst

   - id: azure-kms

     name: "Azure Key Vault"

     content: |

       For clusters using :doc:`Azure Key Vault </security-azure-kms>`
       as their Key Management Service, |service| uses the project's
       Key Identifier, Key Vault Credentials, and Active Directory
       application account credentials at the time of the snapshot to
       automatically encrypt the snapshot data files. This is an
       additional layer of encryption on the existing encryption 
       applied to all |service| storage and snapshot volumes.

       |service| stores the unique ID of the 
       Azure Key Identifier used the encrypt the snapshot. |service|
       also stores the Azure Key Vault
       credentials and the Active Domain application account
       credentials used to access the Key Identifier. 
       |service| uses this information when restoring the snapshot. 
       For complete documentation on restoring an encrypted snapshot, 
       see :ref:`restore-encrypted-snapshot`.

       To view the key used to encrypt a snapshot:

       #. From the :guilabel:`Clusters` view of the |service| UI, click 
          on the cluster name.

       #. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then click 
          :guilabel:`Snapshots`.

       #. Note the :guilabel:`Encryption Key ID` for each snapshot in 
          the cluster. |service| lists the Key Identifier
          used to encrypt the snapshot. Unencrypted snapshots display
          :guilabel:`Not enabled`.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-encrypted-backups-master-key-requirements.rst

For complete documentation on configuring Encryption at Rest using
your Key Management for an |service| project,
see :doc:`/security-kms-encryption`. You can then either
:ref:`deploy <create-cluster-enable-encryption>` a new cluster
:ref:`enable <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>` an existing cluster
with Encryption at Rest using your Key Management.

         if that member is no longer the primary.

         .. include:: /images/cloud-provider-snapshot-single-region-secondary.rst

         |service| automatically creates a new snapshot storage volume
         if the existing snapshot storage volume becomes invalid.
         |service| creates the new volume in the same region as the

         snapshot to maintain backup availability and continues using
         that member and its corresponding region for further
         incremental snapshots.

         Events that can trigger storage invalidation include:

         - Changing the |service| cluster instance size,
         - Modifying the |service| cluster's storage volume or speed,
         - Changing the |service| cluster's :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)` region, and
         - Maintenance performed by |service| or :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)`.

         To manually reset the snapshot target and storage, disable and
         re-enable backups for the cluster. Disabling |service| backups
         removes all snapshots for the cluster.

.. _sharded-global-cluster-backup:

Global Cluster Backups
----------------------

|service| provides backups for :doc:`Global Clusters </global-clusters>`
using Cloud Provider Snapshots as their backup method. |service|
optimizes the migration of data from the source cluster to the target
cluster if the MongoDB zone configurations in the Global Clusters do not
match.

The image below depicts two Global Clusters after |service| reverses the
zone order in the target cluster to optimize data migration for the
restore job. These zones correspond to MongoDB zones defined in
:guilabel:`Zone configuration summary` section ofthe :guilabel:`Global Cluster Configuration`
pane in your MongoDB cluster configuration. 

.. note::

   If you used the API to create your Global Cluster, the zones are defined
   in the ``replicationSpecs`` parameter in the :doc:`Create a Cluster
   </reference/api/clusters-create-one>` and :doc:`Modify a Cluster
   </reference/api/clusters-modify-one>` APIs.

The colored boxes within each MongoDB zone configuration correspond to
AWS regions.

.. figure:: /images/cps-global-cluster-restore-optimization.svg

Without optimization, |service| would have restored the data in the
first configured MongoDB zone in the source cluster to the first
configured MongoDB zone in the target cluster. However, that would
require moving data from the ``US_East_1`` and ``US_West_1`` AWS regions
to the ``EU_Central_1`` AWS region. |service| optimizes data migration
by reversing the zone order for the target cluster and keeping all data
in the same AWS zone where the data resides in the source cluster.

The first time that you restore a Global Cluster, you must enable global
writes on the target cluster.

To enable global writes on the target cluster:

1. Click :guilabel:`Collections` beneath the target cluster on the
   :guilabel:`Clusters` page.

#. Click :guilabel:`Enable Global Writes`.

.. _cloud-provider-backup-schedule:
.. _cloud-provider-retention-policy:

Snapshot Scheduling and Retention Policy
----------------------------------------

|service| takes the first snapshot when you enable cloud provider
snapshots for a cluster and takes subsequent snapshots of the cluster
every 24 hours from that point in time. By default, |service| retains
the last 3 snapshots for each cluster.

You can view and customize the snapshot schedule and retention settings:

#. From the :guilabel:`Clusters` view, click on the cluster name.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.
#. Click :guilabel:`Backup Policy`.

|service| displays the UTC snapshot time using the 24-hour clock format.
To modify the snapshot time, click the dropdown for the :guilabel:`hr`
or :guilabel:`min` and select your preferred hour or minute for
|service| to take snapshots. The first snapshot taken after updating
the snapshot schedule occurs within 24 hours, breaking the default
behavior of one snapshot every 24 hours. All subsequent
snapshots occur once every 24 hours at the configured point in time.

|service| displays the number of snapshots to retain in a text
input field. Type in your preferred number of snapshots for retention.
Changing the number of retained snapshots effects the total cost
of backups for the cluster. For complete documentation on cloud provider
snapshot billing, see :ref:`billing-backup-cloud-provider-snapshots`.
If you decrease the number of retained snapshots, |service|
immediately deletes the extra snapshots.

Click :guilabel:`Save Changes` to save any changes you've made to either
the snapshot schedule or retention settings.

.. important::

   If you disable cloud provider snapshots for a cluster or terminate a
   cluster that had snapshots enabled, |service| immediately
   deletes the backup snapshots for that cluster. For clusters not
   using :ref:`security-kms-encryption`
   you can :ref:`download the latest snapshot 
   <restore-cloud-provider-snapshot-download>` to preserve any data
   stored in the cluster.

.. _cloud-provider-snapshots-on-demand:
.. _on-demand-snapshots:

On-Demand Snapshots
-------------------

|service| takes on-demand snapshots immediately, unlike scheduled
snapshots which occur at :doc:`regular intervals </reference/api/cloud-provider-snapshot-schedule>`.
If there is already an on-demand snapshot with a status of ``queued`` or
``inProgress``, you must wait until |service| has completed the on-demand
snapshot before taking another. If there is already a scheduled snapshot
with a status of ``queued`` or ``inProgress``, you may queue an on-demand
snapshot. You must have the :authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner`
role to successfully call this endpoint.

To take an on-demand snapshot:

1. From the :guilabel:`Clusters` view, click the :icon:`ellipsis-h` button
   below the cluster name and select :guilabel:`Take Snapshot Now`.

#. In the :guilabel:`On-Demand Snapshot` modal, enter the following:

   a. In the :guilabel:`Retention` box, enter the number of days that
      you want |service| to retain the snapshot.

   b. In the :guilabel:`Description` box, enter a descriptive name
      for the snapshot.

#. Click :guilabel:`Take Snapshot`.

Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then click :guilabel:`Snapshots` for
the cluster to view the on-demand snapshot.

.. note::

   The :guilabel:`Take Snapshot Now` button also appears on the :guilabel:`Snapshots`
   page for the cluster.
