Overview
--------

The following tutorial uses 
`Homebrew <https://brew.sh/?jmp=mongodb-docs>`_ to install MongoDB 
{+version+} Community Edition on macOS systems. To install a different 
version of MongoDB, please refer to that versionâ€™s documentation.

Platform Support
----------------

MongoDB only supports macOS versions 10.11 and later on Intel
x86-64. See :ref:`mongodb-supported-platforms` for more
information.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.0-errata-wt-4018.rst

   For details, see :issue:`WT-4018`.

Install MongoDB Community Edition
---------------------------------

.. _osx-prereq:

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have the Homebrew ``brew`` package installed on your OSX host 
*and* you have previously tapped the official 
`MongoDB Homebrew Tap <https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew>`_, 
skip the prerequisites and go to the :ref:`install` step.

Install XCode
`````````````
.. container::

   Apple's XCode includes command-line tools that are required
   by ``brew``, and is available for free on the App Store. Make sure
   you are running the latest version.

Install Homebrew
````````````````

.. container::

   OSX does not include the Homebrew ``brew`` package by default.
   Install ``brew`` using the 
   `official instructions <https://brew.sh/#install>`_.

Tap the MongoDB Homebrew Tap
````````````````````````````

.. container::

   Issue the following from the terminal to
   tap the official 
   `MongoDB Homebrew Tap <https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew>`_:

   .. code-block:: sh

      brew tap mongodb/brew 

.. _install:

Install MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::
   
   From a terminal, issue the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      brew install mongodb-community@{+version+}

   In addition to the :doc:`binaries </reference/program>`, the install
   creates:

   - the :doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>`
     (:file:`/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`)

   - the  :setting:`log directory path <systemLog.path>` (``/usr/local/var/log/mongodb``)

   - the :setting:`data directory path <storage.dbPath>` (``/usr/local/var/mongodb``)

Run MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   You can run MongoDB as a macOS service using ``brew``, or you can run
   MongoDB manually as a background process. It is recommended to run
   MongoDB as a macOS service, as doing so sets the correct system
   ``ulimit`` values automatically (see
   :ref:`ulimit settings <ulimit-settings>` for more information).

   - To run MongoDB (i.e. the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process) **as a
     macOS service**, issue the following:

     .. code-block:: sh

        brew services start mongodb-community

   - To run MongoDB **manually as a background process**, issue the
     following:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf --fork

   Both methods use the :file:`/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf` file created
   during the install. You can add your own MongoDB
   :doc:`configuration options </reference/configuration-options>` to
   this file as well.

   To verify that MongoDB is running, search for ``mongod`` in your
   running processes:

   .. code-block:: sh

      ps aux | grep -v grep | grep mongod

   You can also view the log file to see the current status of your
   ``mongod`` process: ``/usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log``.

Connect and Use MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container::

   To begin using MongoDB, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the
   running instance. From a new terminal, issue the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo

   For information on CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete) operations, see:

   - :doc:`/tutorial/insert-documents`
   - :doc:`/tutorial/query-documents`
   - :doc:`/tutorial/update-documents`
   - :doc:`/tutorial/remove-documents`

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Security
~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB binaries, :binary:`mongod
<bin.mongod>` and :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`, bind to
``localhost`` by default.

When bound only to the localhost, these binaries can only accept
connections from clients that are running on the same machine. Remote
clients cannot connect to the binaries bound only to localhost. For
more information, including how to override and bind to other ip
addresses, see :ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`.
