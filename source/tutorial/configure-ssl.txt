=================================
Configure SSL for MMS Connections
=================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

|MMS| supports SSL for encrypting connections to |MMS| servers, |MMS|
agents, and MongoDB instances. You can implement SSL for the following
points of connection:

- Connections between agents and the :program:`mongod` and
  :program:`mongos` instances.

  To configure the Monitoring Agent to connect to a MongoDB instance
  through SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-for-monitoring`.

  To configure the Backup Agent to connect to a MongoDB instance through
  SSL, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-for-backup` and
  :doc:`/reference/backup-agent`.

- Connection to the MMS servers via HTTPS. The Monitoring and Backup
  Agents use SSL when connecting to the MMS servers. Use an HTTPS proxy in
  front of MMS.

  You can optionally configure a Jetty instance to use HTTPS for
  connections between the |mms| application and agents. To do so, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/configure-jetty-https`.

  For advanced information on SSL settings used by the Monitoring Agent
  when communicating with MMS, :ref:`server-monitoring-ssl`.

  For advanced information on SSL settings used by the Backup Agent when
  communicating with MMS, :ref:`server-backup-ssl`.
