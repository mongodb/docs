Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+django-odm+} to specify
a database query.

You can refine the set of documents that a query returns by creating a
**query filter**. A query filter is an expression that specifies the search
criteria MongoDB uses to match documents in a read or write operation.
In a query filter, you can prompt {+django-odm+} to search for documents with an
exact match to your query, or you can compose query filters to express more
complex matching criteria.

Query API
~~~~~~~~~

The {+framework+} ``QuerySet`` API provides methods that allow you to retrieve
model objects. To run a MongoDB database query, call ``QuerySet`` methods
on your model's manager. The ``Manager`` class handles database
operations and allows you to interact with your MongoDB data by referencing
{+framework+} models. By default, {+framework+} adds a ``Manager`` named ``objects``
to every model class. 

When you assign a ``QuerySet`` to a variable, {+django-odm+} does not
perform the operation until you evaluate the variable. After
evaluating the ``QuerySet``, {+framework+} saves the query results in the ``QuerySet``
cache. Future evaluations of the ``QuerySet`` use the cached results.

.. tip::

   To learn more about the {+framework+} ``QuerySet`` API, see :py:class:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet`
   in the {+framework+} documentation.
   
Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``Movie`` model, which represents
the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`.
The ``Movie`` model contains an embedded ``Award`` model as the value
of its ``awards`` field. These model classes have the following definitions:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
   :start-after: start-models
   :end-before: end-models
   :language: python
   :copyable:

.. include:: /includes/use-sample-data.rst

   .. replacement:: model-classes

      ``Movie`` model includes

   .. replacement:: model-imports

      .. code-block:: python

         from <your application name>.models import Movie, Award
         from django.utils import timezone
         from datetime import datetime

Run a Query
-----------

To query your MongoDB data, call a ``QuerySet`` method on your 
model's manager and specify your matching criteria in a
query filter.

This section describes how to use the following methods from
the ``QuerySet`` API:

- :ref:`all() <django-query-retrieve-all>`
- :ref:`filter() <django-query-retrieve-matching>`
- :ref:`get() <django-query-retrieve-one>`
- :ref:`exclude() <django-query-exclude>`
- :ref:`raw_aggregate() <django-query-raw>`

.. _django-query-retrieve-all:

Retrieve All Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retrieve all documents from a collection, call the ``all()``
method on your model's manager.

The following example calls the ``all()`` method to retrieve
all documents in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-all
      :end-before: end-all
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <QuerySet [<Movie: The Great Train Robbery>, <Movie: A Corner in Wheat>,
      <Movie: Winsor McCay, the Famous Cartoonist of the N.Y. Herald and His Moving Comics>,
      <Movie: Traffic in Souls>, <Movie: Gertie the Dinosaur>,
      <Movie: In the Land of the Head Hunters>, <Movie: The Perils of Pauline>,
      <Movie: The Italian>, <Movie: Regeneration>, <Movie: Civilization>,
      '...(remaining elements truncated)...']>

.. _django-query-retrieve-matching:

Retrieve Matching Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query a collection for documents that match a set of criteria,
call the ``filter()`` method on your model's manager.
Pass a query filter to the ``filter()`` method that specifies your
query criteria.

The following example calls the ``filter()`` method
to query the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
for documents that have a ``runtime`` value of ``300``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-filter
      :end-before: end-filter
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <QuerySet [<Movie: Wild Palms>, <Movie: Streets of Laredo>,
      <Movie: The Way We Live Now>]>

.. _django-query-retrieve-one:

Retrieve One Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retrieve one document from a collection, call the ``get()``
method on your model's manager. Pass a query filter to
the ``get()`` method that specifies your query criteria.

.. important::

   If your query matches no documents or multiple documents, the ``get()``
   method generates an error. To retrieve one document from a query
   that might match multiple, use the :ref:`first() <django-query-first>`
   method.

The following example calls the ``get()`` method
to retrieve one document that has a ``title``
value of ``"Finding Nemo"``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-get
      :end-before: end-get
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <Movie: Finding Nemo>

.. _django-query-exclude:

Exclude Matching Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query a collection for documents that do not meet your
search criteria, call the ``exclude()`` method on your model's
manager. Pass the exclusion criteria as an argument to the
``exclude()`` method.

The following example calls the ``exclude()`` method to
exclude documents released before ``datetime(1980, 1, 1)`` (January 1, 1980)
from the results:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-exclude
      :end-before: end-exclude
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <QuerySet [<Movie: The Iron Horse>, <Movie: Le grand jeu>,
      <Movie: The Devil Is a Woman>, <Movie: Children in the Wind>,
      <Movie: Too Much Johnson>, <Movie: Dots>, <Movie: The Blood of Jesus>,
      <Movie: The Land>, <Movie: The Brothers and Sisters of the Toda Family>,
      <Movie: Begone Dull Care>, '...(remaining elements truncated)...']>

.. tip::

   The preceding example uses the ``lt`` field lookup
   to query the collection. To learn more about comparison
   lookups, see the :ref:`django-query-comparison` section
   in this guide.

.. _django-query-raw:

Run Raw Database Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to run complex queries that {+framework+}'s query API
does not support, you can use the ``raw_aggregate()`` method. This
method allows you to specify your query criteria in a MongoDB
aggregation pipeline, which you pass as an argument to 
``raw_aggregate()``. 

To learn how to run raw database queries, see the :ref:`django-raw-queries`
guide.

.. _django-query-filter:

Customize Your Query Filter
---------------------------

You can further refine your query criteria by using a **field lookup**
in your query filter. Field lookups allow you to clarify the relationship
between the field you're querying and the value you want to
query for. Use the following syntax to specify a field lookup:

.. code-block:: python
   :copyable: false

   Model.objects.filter(<field name>__<lookup type>=<value>)
   
You can use different lookup types to perform advanced queries,
such as partial text matching, array element queries, regular
expression matching, and year value matching for datetime fields. 

.. tip::

   To view a full list of lookup types, see `Field lookups
   <{+django-docs+}/ref/models/querysets/#field-lookups>`__ in the
   ``QuerySet`` {+framework+} API reference.

This section describes how to refine your query filters
in the following ways:

- :ref:`django-query-text-match`
- :ref:`django-query-comparison`
- :ref:`django-query-combine`

.. _django-query-text-match:

Use Text Match Lookups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes some of the lookup types
that you can use to run queries that include specific
matching criteria for text values:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Lookup Type
     - Description

   * - ``exact``
     - | Specifies an exact text match. If you do not provide a 
         lookup type in your query filter, {+django-odm+} uses this
         type by default.
       
       | You can specify a case-insensitive exact text match
         by using ``iexact``.
   * - ``contains``
     - | Specifies a partial text match.
       
       | You can specify a case-insensitive partial text match
         by using ``icontains``.
   * - ``startswith``
     - | Matches field values that begin with the specified text.
       
       | You can specify a case-insensitive partial text match
         by using ``istartswith``.
   * - ``endswith``
     - | Matches field values that end with the specified text.
       
       | You can specify a case-insensitive partial text match
         by using ``iendswith``.

Example
```````

The following example uses the ``contains`` lookup to 
query for documents in which the ``plot`` value
includes the text ``"coming-of-age"``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-filter-contains
      :end-before: end-filter-contains
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <QuerySet [<Movie: Murmur of the Heart>, <Movie: Desert Bloom>,
      <Movie: Girls Town>, <Movie: Get Real>, <Movie: Man of Steel>,
      <Movie: The Holy Land>, <Movie: Secondhand Lions>, <Movie: How to Be Louise>,
      <Movie: Mouth to Mouth>, <Movie: Che ne sarè di noi>, <Movie: Roll Bounce>,
      '...(remaining elements truncated)...']>

.. _django-query-comparison:

Use Comparison Lookups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes some of the lookup types
that you can use to run queries that evaluate a field value
against a specified value:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Lookup Type
     - Description

   * - ``gt``
     - | Matches field values that are greater than the
         specified value.

   * - ``gte``
     - | Matches field values that are greater than or equal
         to the specified value.
       
   * - ``lt``
     - | Matches field values that are less than the specified
         value.

   * - ``lte``
     - | Matches field values that are less or equal to than the specified
         value.


Example
```````

The following example uses the ``lte`` lookup to 
query for documents in which the ``runtime`` value
is less than or equal to ``50``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-filter-lte
      :end-before: end-filter-lte
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <QuerySet [<Movie: The Great Train Robbery>, <Movie: A Corner in Wheat>,
      <Movie: Winsor McCay, the Famous Cartoonist of the N.Y. Herald and His Moving Comics>,
      <Movie: Gertie the Dinosaur>, <Movie: From Hand to Mouth>,
      <Movie: High and Dizzy>, <Movie: One Week>, <Movie: Now or Never>,
      '...(remaining elements truncated)...']>

.. _django-query-combine:

Combine Lookups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run queries that use multiple sets of matching criteria
in the following ways:

- Pass multiple query filters to your query method, separated
  by commas. To view an example, see `Retrieving objects
  <{+django-docs+}/topics/db/queries/#retrieving-objects>`__ in the
  {+framework+} documentation.

- Chain query methods together. To learn more, see `Chaining filters
  <{+django-docs+}/topics/db/queries/#chaining-filters>`__ in the {+framework+}
  documentation.

- Use ``Q`` objects and separate each object with a logical operator.
  To learn more, see `Complex lookups with Q objects
  <{+django-docs+}/topics/db/queries/#complex-lookups-with-q-objects>`__ in the {+framework+}
  documentation.

Q Object Example
````````````````

You can use ``Q`` objects to run queries with multiple
sets of matching criteria. To create a ``Q`` object, pass your query
filter to the ``Q()`` method. You can pass multiple ``Q`` objects as 
arguments to your query method and separate each ``Q`` object by an OR
(``|``), AND (``&``), or XOR (``^``) operator. You can also negate
``Q`` objects by prefixing them with the ``~`` symbol.

This example uses ``Q`` objects to query for documents
that meet the following query conditions:

- ``title`` field value begins either with the text ``"Funny"``
  or ``"Laugh"``
-  ``genres`` array field does not contain the value ``"Comedy"``

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-filter-combine
      :end-before: end-filter-combine
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <QuerySet [<Movie: Laugh, Clown, Laugh>, <Movie: Funny Games>]>

.. tip:: 

   The preceding example uses a field lookup on an
   ``ArrayField`` value. For more information about querying
   an ``ArrayField``, see the :ref:`django-query-arrayfield`
   section in this guide.

Modify Query Results
--------------------

This section describes how to modify your query
results in the following ways:

- :ref:`django-query-sort`
- :ref:`django-query-limit`
- :ref:`django-query-first`

.. _django-query-sort:

Sort Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide a sort order for your query results by using the
``order_by()`` method. To specify an ascending sort based on values
of a given field, pass the field name as an argument. To specify a descending
sort, pass the field name prefixed with a minus symbol (``-``) as an argument.

You can pass multiple field names, separated by commas, to the ``order_by()`` method.
{+django-odm+} sorts results by each field in the order provided.

Example
```````

This example performs the following actions:

- Calls the ``filter()`` method on the ``Movie`` model's manager to query
  the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
- Queries documents that have a ``title`` value starting
  with the text ``"Rocky"``
- Sorts the results in ascending order of their ``released`` field
  values

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-sort
      :end-before: end-sort
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <QuerySet [<Movie: Rocky>, <Movie: Rocky II>, <Movie: Rocky III>,
      <Movie: Rocky IV>, <Movie: Rocky V>, <Movie: Rocky Marciano>,
      <Movie: Rocky Balboa>]>

.. _django-query-limit:

Skip and Limit Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify the number of results that a query returns
by using Python's array-slicing syntax, as shown
in the following code:

.. code-block:: python
   :copyable: false

   Model.objects.filter(<query filter>)[<start>:<end>]

Replace the ``<start>`` and ``<end>`` placeholders with integer
values representing the subset of results you want to return.
The start value is exclusive and the end value is inclusive.

If you omit the ``<start>`` value, the query returns each result,
beginning with the first match, until it returns the number specified
by the ``<end>`` value.

If you omit the ``<end>`` value, the query returns each result
but skips the number of initial results specified by ``<start>``.

Example
```````

This example performs the following actions:

- Calls the ``filter()`` method on the ``Movie`` model's manager to query
  the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
- Queries documents that have a ``released`` value of 
  ``datetime(2010, 7, 16)`` (July 16, 2010)
- Returns the third and fourth results

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-limit
      :end-before: end-limit
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <QuerySet [<Movie: Inception>, <Movie: Winter's Bone>]>

.. _django-query-first:

Retrieve the First Result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retrieve the first result from a query that might match
multiple results, chain the ``first()`` method to the ``filter()``
method. Pass a query filter to the ``filter()`` method that specifies your
query criteria.

The following example calls the ``filter()`` and ``first()`` methods
to query the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection for the first
document in which the ``genres`` value is  ``["Crime", "Comedy"]``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-first
      :end-before: end-first
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <Movie: The Crew>


Advanced Field Queries
----------------------

This section describes how to run queries on the
following field types:

- :ref:`EmbeddedModelField <django-query-embedded>`
- :ref:`ArrayField <django-query-arrayfield>`
- :ref:`JSONField <django-query-jsonfield>`
- :ref:`Primary Key <django-query-primary-key>`

.. _django-query-embedded:

Query an EmbeddedModelField
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run operations on your model that query fields of embedded
models. To query these fields, specify your model field and each embedded field
name separated by double underscores (``__``) until you reach the 
field you want to query, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: python
   :copyable: false

   Model.objects.filter(<model field>__<embedded model field>=<value>)

You can also use :ref:`field lookups <django-query-filter>` to refine
your embedded model query. Add your lookup type after the embedded
model field you're querying, prefixed by double underscores.

Example
```````

This example uses a lookup to query the ``Award`` model, which is embedded
in the ``Movie`` model. This embedded model represents the
``awards`` field in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
and its nested ``wins``,  ``nominations``, and ``text`` fields. The
following code queries for documents in which the ``awards.wins``
nested field value is greater than ``150``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-filter-relationships
      :end-before: end-filter-relationships
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <QuerySet [<Movie: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King>,
      <Movie: No Country for Old Men>, <Movie: Slumdog Millionaire>,
      <Movie: Boyhood>, <Movie: The Social Network>, <Movie: Inception>,
      <Movie: Gravity>, <Movie: Gravity>, <Movie: The Artist>,
      <Movie: 12 Years a Slave>, <Movie: Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)>]>

.. _django-query-arrayfield:

Query an ArrayField
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can query data stored in an ``ArrayField`` value
by using the standard query syntax. {+django-odm+} provides
additional field lookup types for querying ``ArrayField`` values,
which are described in the following table:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Lookup Type
     - Description

   * - ``contains``
     - | Matches fields that store the provided value as
         a subset of their data. This ``ArrayField`` lookup overrides the
         ``contains`` lookup described in the :ref:`django-query-text-match`
         section of this guide.

   * - ``contained_by``
     - | Matches fields that store a subset of the provided values.
         This lookup type is the inverse of ``contains``.
       
   * - ``overlap``
     - | Matches field that store any of the provided values.

   * - ``len``
     - | Matches fields that store the number of values provided.

Example
```````

The following example uses the ``overlap`` lookup to query
for documents whose  ``genres`` field contains any values in the
``["Adventure", "Family"]`` array:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-array
      :end-before: end-array
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <QuerySet [<Movie: The Poor Little Rich Girl>, <Movie: Robin Hood>,
      <Movie: Peter Pan>, <Movie: The Thief of Bagdad>, <Movie: Clash of the Wolves>,
      <Movie: Beau Geste>, <Movie: The Black Pirate>, <Movie: The Son of the Sheik>,
      <Movie: Steamboat Willie>, <Movie: The Big Trail>, <Movie: The Champ>,
      '...(remaining elements truncated)...']>

.. _django-query-jsonfield:

Query a JSONField
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can query data stored in a ``JSONField`` value by using the 
same syntax as show in the :ref:`django-query-embedded`
section. Chain each field and nested field name together, separated
by double underscores (``__``), until you reach the field you want
to query.

The following example queries the ``JSONField``-valued ``imdb`` field
for values of its nested ``votes`` field that exceed ``900000``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-json
      :end-before: end-json
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <QuerySet [<Movie: La nao capitana>, <Movie: The Godfather>,
      <Movie: This Is Spinal Tap>, <Movie: Forrest Gump>, <Movie: Pulp Fiction>,
      <Movie: The Shawshank Redemption>, <Movie: Se7en>,
      <Movie: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring>,
      <Movie: The Matrix>, <Movie: Fight Club>,
      <Movie: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King>,
      <Movie: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers>, <Movie: The Shawshank Redemption>,
      <Movie: Landet som icke èr>, <Movie: The Dark Knight>,
      <Movie: The Danish Girl>, <Movie: The Dark Knight Rises>, <Movie: Inception>,
      <Movie: Catching the Sun>, <Movie: Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse>,
      '...(remaining elements truncated)...']>

Annotate and Filter JSON Data
`````````````````````````````

You can use ``KT()`` expressions to annotate and filter
data stored in a ``JSONField`` value. ``KT()`` expressions allow you to
work with the text value of keys, indexes, or path transforms
within a ``JSONField``. Pass your ``KT()`` expression to the ``annotate()``
method, which annotates each object in the ``QuerySet`` with the
provided ``KT()`` expressions.

.. tip::

   To learn more about ``KT()`` expressions and the ``annotate()`` method,
   see the following resources in the {+framework+} documentation:

   - :py:class:`~django.db.models.fields.json.KT`
   - :py:meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.annotate`

The following example uses  ``annotate()`` and ``KT()`` to create a
new ``score`` key, which stores ``imdb.rating`` nested field values.
Then, the code sorts each document in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
by their descending ``score`` values:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-kt
      :end-before: end-kt
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      <QuerySet [<Movie: No Tomorrow>, <Movie: The Deposit>, <Movie: Man Down>,
      <Movie: Convenience>, <Movie: Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse>,
      <Movie: Another World>, <Movie: The Danish Girl>, <Movie: Ad Inexplorata>,
      <Movie: Landet som icke èr>, <Movie: The Ghost and the Whale>,
      <Movie: Coming to Terms>, <Movie: La nao capitana>, <Movie: All Eyes and Ears>,
      <Movie: Catching the Sun>, <Movie: Manhattan Romance>, <Movie: Anomalisa>,
      <Movie: Outliving Emily>, <Movie: Mary Loss of Soul>,
      <Movie: The Childhood of a Leader>, <Movie: Krot na more>,
      '...(remaining elements truncated)...']>

.. _django-query-primary-key:

Query a Primary Key Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``pk`` lookup shortcut to query primary key
values, which MongoDB stores as ``ObjectId`` values.

The following example queries the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
for a document whose primary key is ``ObjectId("573a1394f29313caabce0d37")``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
      :start-after: start-primary-key-pk
      :end-before: end-primary-key-pk
      :language: python

   .. output::
      :visible: false
     
      // Your ObjectId values might differ

      <Movie: Vertigo>

The ``Movie`` model, which represents the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection,
uses the ``id`` field as its primary key. The following example constructs
the same query as the preceding code by using the  ``id`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/specify-a-query.py
    :language: python
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-primary-key-id
    :end-before: end-primary-key-id
