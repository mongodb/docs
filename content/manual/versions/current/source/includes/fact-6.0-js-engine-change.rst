MongoDB 6.0 upgrades the internal JavaScript engine used for
:ref:`server-side JavaScript <server-side-javascript>`,
:group:`$accumulator`, :expression:`$function`, and :query:`$where`
expressions and from MozJS-60 to MozJS-91. Several deprecated,
non-standard array and string functions that existed in MozJS-60 are
removed in MozJS-91.
