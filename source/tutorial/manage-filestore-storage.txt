Considerations
--------------

|onprem| doesn't compress backups to file system stores from MongoDB
databases running |fcv-link| 4.2 or later. |onprem| ignores the
:setting:`File System Store Gzip Compression Level` setting for those
databases.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before creating any file system snapshot stores:

- Attach storage volumes with sufficient capacity to the |onprem| host.
  These volumes store the snapshot files and the
  :term:`Oplog Store <Oplog Store Database>` MongoDB database. The
  Oplog Store doesn't need to be on the same host as the file system
  snapshot store.

- Grant the storage volumes the relevant permissions:

  - On Windows, grant access to the ``SYSTEM`` user.
  - On package-installed Linux distributions, grant access to the
    ``mongodb-mms:mongodb-mms`` user and group.
  - On archive extracted Linux distributions, grant access to the same
    user and group you assigned to the |onprem| installation.

- :doc:`Deploy the dedicated MongoDB instance(s) </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>`
  to host the Oplog Stores for this snapshot store.

- Ensure the host running the |onprem| :term:`Backup Daemon` service
  has sufficient capacity to store the :term:`head` database.

- When running many |onprem| instances, use a |nas| or |san| for your
  file system store. This ensures that all instances share the same
  storage. You can't restore backups or remove expired snapshots if the
  |onprem| instances don't share the file system store.

Edit an Existing File System Store

Once created, file system stores are listed directly on the
:guilabel:`Snapshot Storage` page in a table. Each row contains the
settings for each File System Store.
