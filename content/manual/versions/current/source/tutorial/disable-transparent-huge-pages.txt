.. important:: Upgraded TCMalloc in MongoDB 8.0

   Starting in MongoDB 8.0, MongoDB uses an upgraded version of TCMalloc 
   that improves performance with Transparent Hugepages enabled. If you are 
   using MongoDB 8.0 or later, see :ref:`enable-thp`. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-thp-intro.rst

When running MongoDB 7.0 or earlier on Linux, THP should be disabled 
for best performance. In earlier versions of MongoDB, database workloads often 
experience decreased performance with THP enabled because they often use 
non-contiguous, memory access patterns. 

.. note:: 

   .. include:: /includes/fact-thp-process-level.rst

To ensure that THP is disabled before :binary:`~bin.mongod` starts,
create a service file for your operating system that disables THP at boot. The 
following instructions include examples for both the **systemd** and the 
**System V init** initialization systems.

Additionally, for :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)` and CentOS
systems that use ``ktune`` and ``tuned`` performance profiles, you must create 
a custom ``tuned`` profile as well.

Create a Service File
---------------------

To create a service file that disables THP, use the built-in initialization 
system for your operating system. Recent versions of Linux typically use 
**systemd**, which uses the ``systemctl`` command. Older versions of 
Linux use **System V init**, which uses the ``service`` command. For more 
information, see the documentation for your operating system.

Use the initialization system for your operating system:

   .. tab:: systemd (systemctl)
      :tabid: systemd-systemctl

   .. tab:: System V Init (service)
      :tabid: initd-service

.. _disable-thp-configure-thp-tuned:

Using ``tuned`` and ``ktune``
-----------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-tuned-ktune-profiles.rst

``tuned`` and ``ktune`` are kernel tuning utilities that can affect the 
Transparent Hugepages setting on your system. If you use ``tuned`` or ``ktune`` 
on your :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)` or CentOS system while running 
``mongod``, you must create a custom ``tuned`` profile to ensure that THP 
stays disabled.
