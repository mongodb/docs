You can create a free tier MongoDB deployment on MongoDB Atlas
to store and manage your data. MongoDB Atlas hosts and manages
your MongoDB database in the cloud.

   .. step:: Create a free MongoDB deployment on Atlas

      Complete the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started?tck=docs_driver_java>`
      guide to set up a new Atlas account and a free tier MongoDB deployment.
      Ensure that you :atlas:`load sample data </sample-data/>` and
      :atlas:`add your IP address </security/add-ip-address-to-list/>` to the IP access
      list.
      
   .. step:: Save your credentials

      After you create your database user, save that user's 
      username and password to a safe location for use in an upcoming step.
  
After you complete these steps, you have a new free tier MongoDB
deployment on Atlas, database user credentials, and sample data loaded
in your database.
