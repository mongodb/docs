|service| {+free-clusters+} provide a small-scale development
environment to host your data. {+Free-clusters+} never expire, and
provide access to a :ref:`subset <atlas-free-tier>` of Atlas features
and functionality.

Paid clusters provide full access to |service| features, configuration
options, and operational capabilities. For more information on paid
clusters, including deployment instructions, see
:doc:`/tutorial/create-new-cluster`.

.. note::

   You can deploy only one {+free-cluster+} per |service| project.

Procedure
---------

You can create {+free-clusters+} through the `{+atlas-cli+} <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/stable/>`__, 
|service| User Interface, and |service| Administration API. Select the appropriate 
tab based on how you would like to create the {+free-clusters+}.

.. tabs:: 
 
   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli  

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-quickstart.rst

      .. note::

         If you run ``atlas setup`` with the default selections, you
         don't need to run ``atlas quickstart``.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+} 
      :tabid: api 

      To create a free cluster using the |service| Administration API, 
      send a ``POST`` request to the ``clusters`` endpoint with the 
      ``instanceSize`` set to ``M0``. To learn more about the resource 
      and parameters, see: 

      - :ref:`create-one-cluster-ref`
      - :ref:`create-one-advanced-cluster-ref`

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui 

      To create a free cluster through the {+atlas-ui+}:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-create-cluster.rst
  

Next Steps
----------

Now that your {+cluster+} is provisioned, proceed to
:doc:`/security/add-ip-address-to-list`.
