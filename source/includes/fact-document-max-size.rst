Documents have a 16 megabytes size limit.

The maximum document size helps ensure that a single document cannot
use excessive amount of RAM or, during transmission, excessive amount
of bandwidth. To store larger objects, MongoDB provides the
GridFS API to handle documents larger than the maximum size. See your
specific driver documentation for GridFS.
