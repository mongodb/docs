When you invite an organization member to projects within the 
organization, the user is automatically granted access to 
those projects and doesn't receive any invitations. When you invite a 
user to projects in an organization that the user doesn't belong to, 
the user receives a single invitation to the organization, which 
includes access to all of the projects that you grant them access to. 
Invitations expire after 30 days.
