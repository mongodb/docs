Overview
--------

Usage examples provide convenient starting points for popular MongoDB
operations. Each example provides:

- an explanation of the operation in the example showing the
  purpose and a sample use case for the method

- an explanation of how to use the operation, including parameters,
  return values, and common exceptions you might encounter

- a full Node.js program that you can copy and paste to run the example
  in your own environment

How to Use the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

These examples use the
:atlas:`MongoDB Atlas sample data <sample-data?tck=docs_driver_nodejs>`
database. You can use this sample data on the free tier
of MongoDB Atlas by following the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas
<getting-started/#atlas-getting-started?tck=docs_driver_nodejs>` guide or you
can :guides:`import the sample dataset into a local MongoDB instance
</server/import>`.

Once you have imported the dataset, you can copy and paste a usage
example into your development environment of choice. You can follow the
:doc:`quick start guide </quick-start>` to learn more about getting
started with Node.js, npm, and the Node.js driver. Once you've copied
a usage example, you'll have to edit one line to get the example running
with your instance of MongoDB:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // Replace the following with your MongoDB deployment's connection string.
   const uri =
      "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>?retryWrites=true&w=majority";

You can use the :guides:`Atlas Connectivity Guide
</cloud/connectionstring/>` to enable connectivity to your instance of
Atlas and find the :manual:`connection string
</reference/connection-string/>` to replace the ``uri`` variable in the
usage example. If your instance uses :manual:`SCRAM authentication
</core/security-scram/>`, you can replace ``<user>`` with your username,
``<password>`` with your password, and ``<cluster-url>`` with the IP
address or URL of your instance. Consult the
:doc:`Connection Guide </fundamentals/connection>` for more information
about getting connected to your MongoDB instance.
