msgid "This sequence gives ``0`` votes to the fourth, fifth, and sixth members of the set according to the order of the :data:`~local.system.replset.members` array in the output of :method:`rs.conf()`. This setting allows the set to elect these members as :term:`primary` but does not allow them to vote in elections. Place voting members so that your designated primary or primaries can reach a majority of votes in the event of a network partition."

When the primary steps down, the :program:`mongod` closes all client connections. While this typically takes 10-20 seconds, try to make these changes during scheduled maintenance periods."
