Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to secure communications between your
{+connector+} worker and your MongoDB cluster. 

To secure your connection, you must perform the following tasks:

- :ref:`Create the certificates <prerequisites-mkc>`
- :ref:`Store the certificates on the worker host machine <key-store-trust-store-setup-mkc>`
- :ref:`Supply the certificates' credentials to the connector <supply-credentials-to-mkc>`

.. note::

   If you host your MongoDB cluster on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` or
   your cluster does not explicitly require certificates, you can
   already communicate securely and do not need to follow the steps in
   this guide.

Prerequisites
-------------

This guide requires prior knowledge of the following concepts:

- :wikipedia:`Transport Layer Security <Transport_Layer_Security>`
- :wikipedia:`X.509 <x.509>`
- :wikipedia:`Certificate Authorities (CA) <Certificate_authority>`
- :wikipedia:`PKCS 12 <PKCS_12>`
- `OpenSSL <https://www.openssl.org/>`__
- `keytool <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/tools/keytool.html>`__

Store Certificates on the Worker
--------------------------------

Store your certificates in a **keystore** and **truststore** to secure
your certificate credentials for each server you run your connector worker
instance on.

Keystore
~~~~~~~~

You can use a keystore to store private keys and identity certificates.
The keystore uses the key and certificate to verify the client's
identity to external hosts.

If your SSL/TLS configuration requires a client certificate to connect
to your worker instance, generate a secure private key and include the
client certificate bundled with the intermediate CA. Then, store this
information in your keystore by using the following ``openssl`` command
to generate a PKCS 12 file:

.. code-block:: bash

   openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey <your private key> \
                  -in <your bundled certificate> \
                  -out <your output pkcs12 file>

Truststore
~~~~~~~~~~

You can use a truststore to store certificates from a CA. The truststore
uses the certificates to identify parties the client trusts. Some
examples of these certificates are a root CA, intermediate CA and your
MongoDB cluster's end entity certificate.

Import the certificates of parties that you trust into your truststore
by using the following ``keytool`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   keytool -import -trustcacerts -import -file <your root or intermediate CA>

If your SSL/TLS configuration requires the end entity certificate for your
MongoDB cluster, import it into your truststore with the following
command:

.. code-block:: bash

   keytool -import -file <your server bundled certificate> -keystore <your keystore name>

For more information on how to set up a client keystore and truststore for
testing purposes, see 
:manual:`OpenSSL Client Certificates for Testing </appendix/security/appendixC-openssl-client/#appendix-c-openssl-client-certificates-for-testing>`.

.. _supply-credentials-to-mkc:

Add Credentials to the Connector
--------------------------------

The connector worker processes JVM options from your ``KAFKA_OPTS``
environment variable. The environment variable contains the path and
password to your keystore and truststore.

Export the following JVM options in your ``KAFKA_OPTS`` variable: 

.. code-block:: bash

   export KAFKA_OPTS="\
   -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<your path to truststore> \
   -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<your truststore password> \
   -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<your path to keystore> \
   -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<your keystore password>"

When the worker processes the JVM options, the connector attempts to
connect by using the SSL/TLS protocol and certificates in your keystore
and truststore.
