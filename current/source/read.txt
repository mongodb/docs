Overview
--------

On this page, you can see copyable code examples that show common
{+driver-short+} methods for retrieving documents.

.. tip::

   To learn more about any of the methods shown on this page, see the link
   provided in each section.

To use an example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <cpp-read-sample>` or your own application.
Be sure to replace all placeholders, such as ``<connection string>``, with
the relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.

Find One
--------

The following code shows how to retrieve a single document from a collection
that matches the specified criteria:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/read-code-examples.cpp
   :start-after: start-find-one
   :end-before: end-find-one
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``find_one()`` method, see the :ref:`cpp-retrieve-find-one`
section in the Retrieve Data guide.

Find Multiple
-------------

The following code shows how to retrieve all documents from a collection
that match the specified criteria:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/read-code-examples.cpp
   :start-after: start-find-multiple
   :end-before: end-find-multiple
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``find()`` method, see the :ref:`cpp-retrieve-find-multiple`
section in the Retrieve Data guide.

Count Documents in a Collection
-------------------------------

The following code shows how to count the number of documents in
a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/read-code-examples.cpp
   :start-after: start-count
   :end-before: end-count
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``count_documents()`` method, see the
:ref:`cpp-accurate-count` section in the Count Documents guide.

Count Documents Returned from a Query
-------------------------------------

The following code shows how to count documents in a collection
that match the specified criteria:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/read-code-examples.cpp
   :start-after: start-count-query
   :end-before: end-count-query
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``count_documents()`` method, see the
:ref:`cpp-accurate-count` section in the Count Documents guide.

Estimated Document Count
------------------------

The following code shows how to retrieve an estimated count of the
number of documents in a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/read-code-examples.cpp
   :start-after: start-count-estimate
   :end-before: end-count-estimate
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``estimated_document_count()`` method, see the
:ref:`cpp-estimated-count` section in the Count Documents guide.

Retrieve Distinct Values
------------------------

The following code shows how to retrieve the unique values of a field
for documents that match the specified criteria:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/read-code-examples.cpp
   :start-after: start-distinct
   :end-before: end-distinct
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``distinct()`` method, see the
:ref:`cpp-distinct` guide.

Monitor Data Changes
--------------------

The following code shows how to monitor and print changes to a
collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/read-code-examples.cpp
   :start-after: start-change-stream
   :end-before: end-change-stream
   :language: cpp
   :dedent:

To learn more about the ``watch()`` method, see the
:ref:`cpp-change-streams` guide.
