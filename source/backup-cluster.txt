   This feature is not available for ``M0`` (Free Tier) clusters. To
   learn more about ``M0`` cluster limitations, see
   :ref:`atlas-free-tier`.

Backup Methods
--------------

|service| offers the following methods to back up your data.

:doc:`/backup/continuous-backups`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available in M10+ Clusters.*

|service| uses incremental snapshots to continuously back up your
data. Continuous backup snapshots are typically just a few seconds
behind the operational system.

|service| ensures point-in-time backup of replica sets and consistent,
cluster-wide snapshots of sharded clusters.

For each |service| project with continuous snapshots enabled, |service|
stores the continuous backup snapshots in the backup data center
location where continuous backups were *first* enabled for a cluster in
the project.

Continuous snapshots support restoring from the full snapshot
or from a point-in-time between snapshots. You can also
:doc:`query a continuous snapshot </query-backup>`.

With |service| continuous backup, the total number of collections
across all databases in a |service| cluster cannot equal or exceed
``100,000``.

:doc:`/backup/cloud-provider-snapshots`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Available in M10+ Clusters.*

|service| uses the native snapshot capabilities of your cloud provider
to support full-copy snapshots and localized snapshot storage.

|service| supports cloud provider snapshots on:

- :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`
- :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
- :ref:`Google GCP <google-gcp>`

:doc:`/backup/m2-m5-snapshots`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backups are automatically enabled for ``M2`` and ``M5`` shared-tier
clusters and cannot be disabled. |service| takes daily snapshots of your
``M2`` and ``M5`` clusters which you can restore to clusters tiers
``M2`` or greater.

Considerations
--------------

Be aware that:

- |service| backups are not available for ``M0`` (Free Tier) clusters.
  You may use :ref:`mongodump <command-line-tools-mongodump>` to back up
  your ``M0`` cluster data and
  :ref:`mongorestore <command-line-tools-mongorestore>` to restore that
  data. To learn how to manually back up your data, see
  :doc:`Command Line Tools </command-line-tools>`.
