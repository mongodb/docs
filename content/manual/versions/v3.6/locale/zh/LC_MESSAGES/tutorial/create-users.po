"MongoDB employs role-based access control (RBAC) to determine access for "
"users. A user is granted one or more :ref:`roles <roles>` that determine "
"the user's access or privileges to MongoDB :ref:`resources <resource-"
"document>` and the :ref:`actions <security-user-actions>` that user can "
"perform. A user should have only the minimal set of privileges required "
"to ensure a system of :term:`least privilege`."
