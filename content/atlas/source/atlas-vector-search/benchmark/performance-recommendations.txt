This page provides additional recommendations for improving the
performance of your {+avs+} queries.

Ensure Sufficient Memory 
------------------------

|hnsw| works efficiently when vector data is held in memory. You must
ensure that the data nodes have sufficient RAM to hold the vector data
and indexes. We recommend deploying separate :ref:`Search Nodes for
workload isolation <configure-search-nodes>` without data isolation,
which enables more efficient usage of memory for vector search use
cases.

The amount of CPU, memory, and disk resources that {+avs+} consumes
depends on several factors, including your index size and the query
criteria. It's important to monitor your environment to understand your 
vector search health and performance and to confirm adequate
infrastructure capacity and identify any anomalies. 

Use the following metrics to observe and improve the performance of your
{+avs+} indexes and queries:

Search System Memory 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monitor the total amount of RAM used by your {+avs+} indexes. Adequate
RAM is critical for {+avs+} query performance because queries going to
disk are much less performant. Ensure that the entire index is able to
fit in memory.  

Ensure that available :guilabel:`System Memory` is always greater than
used :guilabel:`System Memory`. If the index is not frequently queried,
not all of the index might be in memory. Therefore, leverage the
:guilabel:`System Memory` metric in conjunction with the
:guilabel:`Index Size` :ref:`metric <review-available-metrics>` to
optimize provisioning.

If the vector index size is over 3 GB, we recommend :ref:`vector
quantization <avs-quantization>`, which stores only 4% of the index
in memory rather than the full index.

Search Index Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monitor the total size of all indexes on disk in bytes. This is
necessary to ensure that you have accurately sized your RAM requirements.  

Verify the search :guilabel:`Index Size` on disk :ref:`metric
<review-available-metrics>` to see what the full index size would be if
100% of the vector is stored in memory, and ensure that it is less than
the system memory available.  

Search Page Faults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Monitor the average rate of page faults on a process per second over a
selected sample period. The :guilabel:`Page Faults` metric indicates how
frequently the search query is going to disk, which indicates that the
full index is not fitting into memory.

This metric must remain as close to zero as possible. If you consistently
see page faults, consider scaling the cluster tier up to
provision adequate RAM. 

Warm Up the Filesystem Cache  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you perform vector search without using :ref:`dedicated Search Nodes 
<what-is-search-node>`, your queries initially perform random seeks on
disk as you traverse the |hnsw| graph and the vector values are read
into memory. When using Search Nodes, this cache warming typically only
occurs in the event of an index rebuild, usually during scheduled
maintenance windows. 

Monitor for CPU Bottlenecks
----------------------------

Vector embeddings consume computational resources during indexing. 
|enn| queries on large datasets consume CPU resources. As a result,
indexing and querying at the same time may cause resource  
bottlenecks. To prevent CPU bottlenecks, avoid indexing vectors when
queries are running. When performing an initial sync, ensure that your
Search Node CPU usage returns close to 0%, indicating segments have
been merged and flushed to disk, before issuing test queries. 

Monitor the :guilabel:`Search Normalized Process CPU` metric during
indexing operations, as heavy indexing will show elevated CPU usage. This
:ref:`metric <review-atlas-search-metrics>` shows the CPU usage as a
percentage normalized against the number of available CPU cores, which
enables you to assess the resource saturation relative to your cluster's
capacity. After vector embeddings have been indexed, wait for the CPU
usage to return close to 0% as segment merging and flushing complete.
