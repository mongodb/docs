Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: killOp

   Terminates an operation as specified by the operation ID.
   :binary:`~bin.mongosh` provides the 
   :method:`db.killOp()` helper.
   To find operations and their corresponding IDs,
   see :pipeline:`$currentOp` or :method:`db.currentOp()`.
   
   .. |command| replace:: killOp

   The ``killOp`` command must be run against the ``admin`` database.

Behavior
--------

Do *not* use :dbcommand:`killOp` to terminate an in-progress index
builds in replica sets or sharded clusters. Use :dbcommand:`dropIndexes`
on the :term:`primary` to drop the index. See 
:ref:`dropIndexes-cmd-index-builds`.

Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On systems running with :setting:`~security.authorization`, to kill
operations not owned by the user, the user must have access that
includes the :authaction:`killop` privilege action.

On :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, users can kill their own operations
even without the :authaction:`killop` privilege action.

Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :dbcommand:`killOp` command can be run on
a :binary:`~bin.mongos` and can kill queries (i.e. read operations)
that span shards in a cluster. The :dbcommand:`killOp` command from the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` does not propagate to the shards when the
operation to be killed is a write operation.

For information on how to list sharding operations that are active on a
:binary:`~bin.mongos`, see the ``localOps`` parameter in
:pipeline:`$currentOp`.

For more information and examples on killing operations on a sharded
cluster, see:

- :ref:`kill-read-ops-sharded-cluster`

- :ref:`kill-write-ops-sharded-cluster`

Example
-------

The following example uses :dbcommand:`killOp` to target
the running operation with opid ``3478``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { "killOp": 1, "op": 3478 } )

The operation returns the following result:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "info" : "attempting to kill op", "ok" : 1 }

:dbcommand:`killOp` reports success if it succeeded in marking the
specified operation for termination. Operations may not actually be
terminated until they reach an appropriate interruption point. Use
:pipeline:`$currentOp` or :method:`db.currentOp()` to confirm the
target operation was terminated.
