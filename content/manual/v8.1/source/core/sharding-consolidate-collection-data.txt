Prior to MongoDB v8.0, sharding a collection was an irreversible action. 
Starting in v8.0, you can unshard a collection to the shard of your choice.

When to Unshard a Collection
----------------------------

The following scenarios benefit from moving unsharded collections across shards.

Correcting unintentional sharding of a collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you discover that sharding was unnecessary or causing performance issues, 
you can use the``unshardCollection`` command to rewrite the entire collection 
as an unsharded collection.

Simplifying zone-based isolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use :ref:`zones <zone-sharding>` to keep a sharded collection on a 
single shard, you can now unshard the collection to reduce the complexity in 
your cluster.

Consolidating previously sharded small collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you sharded small collections to efficiently utilize resources on multiple 
shards, you can unshard and move the collections to a shard of your choice. 
Doing so reduces the complexity of a deployment while maintaining appropriate 
resource allocation.

Command Syntax
--------------

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.unshardCollection("database.collection", "shardName")

The following example unshards the ``riders`` collection in the ``taxi`` 
database and moves the collection to ``shard1``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({unshardCollection:"taxi.riders", toShard: "shard1"})
