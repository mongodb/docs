.. dbcommand:: repairDatabase

   Rebuilds the database and indexes by discarding invalid or corrupt
   data, which may be present due to an unexpected system restart or
   crash. :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` is analogous to a ``fsck``
   command for file systems.

   .. warning::

      - Before using :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, make a backup copy of
        the files in the dbpath directory.

      - .. include:: /includes/note-repair.rst

      - Avoid running :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` against a replica set.
        If you are trying to repair a :term:`replica set` member, and you
        have access to an intact copy of your data (e.g. a recent backup
        or an intact member of the :term:`replica set`), you should
        restore from that intact copy (see
        :doc:`/tutorial/resync-replica-set-member`), and **not** use
        :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`.

      - You should only use the :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command and
        :ref:`associated wrappers <repairdb-helpers>` if you have no
        other options. These operations remove and do not save any
        corrupt data during the repair process.

   :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { repairDatabase: 1 }

   :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` has the following fields:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``preserveClonedFilesOnFailure``
   
        - boolean
   
        - When ``true``, ``repairDatabase`` will not delete temporary files
          in the backup directory on error, and all new files are created
          with the "backup" instead of "_tmp" directory prefix. By default
          ``repairDatabase`` does not delete temporary files, and uses the
          "_tmp" naming prefix for new files.
          
          .. versionchanged:: 3.0
             ``preserveClonedFilesOnFailure`` is only available with the
             ``mmapv1`` storage engine.
          
          
   
      * - ``backupOriginalFiles``
   
        - boolean
   
        - When ``true``, ``repairDatabase`` moves old database files to the
          backup directory instead of deleting them before moving new files
          into place. New files are created with the "backup" instead of "_tmp"
          directory prefix. By default, ``repairDatabase`` leaves temporary
          files unchanged, and uses the "_tmp" naming prefix for new files.
          
          .. versionchanged:: 3.0
             ``backupOriginalFiles`` is only available with the
             ``mmapv1`` storage engine.
          
          
   


   You can explicitly set the options as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { repairDatabase: 1,
        preserveClonedFilesOnFailure: <boolean>,
        backupOriginalFiles: <boolean> }

   See :option:`mongod --repair` and :option:`mongodump --repair` for
   information on these related options.


.. _repairdb-helpers:

``repairDatabase`` Wrappers
---------------------------

You may invoke :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` from multiple contexts:

- Use the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to run the command, as above.

- Use the :method:`db.repairDatabase()` in the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
  shell.

- Run :binary:`~bin.mongod` directly from your system's shell. Make sure
  that :binary:`~bin.mongod` isn't already running, and that you invoke
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` as a user that has access to MongoDB's data files:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongod --repair

  For MMAPv1, you can specify a temporary working directory that the
  command will use during the repair operation:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongod --repair --repairpath /opt/vol2/data

  See :setting:`~storage.repairPath` for more information.

Behavior
--------

.. include:: /includes/warning-blocking-global.rst

The time requirement for :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` depends on the
size of the data set.

:dbcommand:`repairDatabase` recreates all indexes in the database.

MMAPv1
~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`repairDatabase` requires free disk space equal to the size of your
current data set plus 2 gigabytes.
If the volume that holds dbpath lacks sufficient space, you can mount a separate volume
and use that for the repair. When mounting a separate volume for
:dbcommand:`repairDatabase` you must run :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`
from the command line and use the
:option:`--repairpath <mongod --repairpath>`
switch to specify the folder in which to store
temporary repair files.

WiredTiger
~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`repairDatabase` performs the operation in-place and does not require
additional disk space.


``repairDatabase`` and ``compact``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command rebuilds the database, which
for MMAPv1, has a secondary effect of compacting all the collections.

For WiredTiger, the operation rebuilds the database but does **not**
result in the compaction of the collections in the database.

Example
-------

.. warning::

   If you are trying to repair a :term:`replica set` member, and you
   have access to an intact copy of your data (e.g. a recent backup or
   an intact member of the :term:`replica set`), see
   :doc:`/tutorial/resync-replica-set-member` instead.

   .. include:: /includes/note-repair.rst

   Use :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` if you have no other option.

   Before using :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`, make a backup copy of the
   data files in the dbpath.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { repairDatabase: 1 } )
