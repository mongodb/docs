Definition
----------

.. method:: rs.remove(hostname)

   Removes the member described by the ``hostname`` parameter from the
   current :term:`replica set`. This function will disconnect the
   shell briefly and forces a reconnection as the :term:`replica set`
   renegotiates which member will be :term:`primary`. As a
   result, the shell will display an error even if this command
   succeeds.

   The :method:`rs.remove()` method has the following parameter:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``hostname``
   
        - string
   
        - The hostname of a system in the replica set.
          
          
   


   .. note::

      Before running the :method:`rs.remove()` operation, it is good
      practice to *shut down* the replica set member that you are
      removing.

Behavior
--------

..
  This behavior will change once SERVER-36417 closes. 

By default, replica set members wait for 5 minutes before dropping
connections to the removed member. In sharded replica sets, you can
modify this timeout using the
:parameter:`ShardingTaskExecutorPoolHostTimeoutMS` server parameter.

.. versionadded:: 4.2
   
   To immediately drop all outgoing connections from the replica set to
   the removed member, run the :dbcommand:`dropConnections`
   administrative command  on each remaining member on the replica set:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( 
     {
       "dropConnections" : 1,
       "hostAndPort" : [
         "<hostname>:<port>"
       ] 
     } 
   )

Replace ``<hostname>`` with the hostname of the removed member and
``<port>`` with the port the :binary:`~bin.mongod` listened on.
