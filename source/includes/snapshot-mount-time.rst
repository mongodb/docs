.. note::

   Wait for the Queryable Snapshot to mount before you
   continue. Snapshot mount time depends on the size of the
   snapshot. To verify the snapshot is mounted:
   
   1. .. include:: /includes/nav/list-continuous-backup.rst
   #. Select the :guilabel:`Restore History` tab.
   
   When the snapshot is mounted, the :guilabel:`Status`
   column reports the date and time of the mount operation.
