You can measure the accuracy of your {+avs+} query by evaluating how
closely the results for an |ann| search match the results of an |enn|
search against quantized vectors by using the same query criteria. That
is, you can compare the results of |ann| search with the results of
|enn| search and measure how frequently the |ann| search results include
the nearest neighbors in the results from the |enn| search. 

Use Cases 
---------

You might want to measure the accuracy of the results if you have any of
the following: 

- Quantized vectors 
- Large numbers of vectors
- Low dimensional vectors

Prerequisites 
-------------

To try the examples on this page, you need the following:

- An |service| {+cluster+} with, optionally, the sample dataset. 
- {+mongosh+}

Procedures 
----------

To evaluate the accuracy of your :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` query
results, you must do the following:  

1. Create an {+avs+} index on the vector field and on any other fields
   that you want to pre-filter the data by. 

   We recommend using quantized vectors to improve the storage of your
   vectors and speed of your queries. If you don't have quantized
   vectors, you can enable automatic quantization when indexing your
   ``vector`` type field. 

2. Construct and run the |enn| query followed by the |ann| query. 
3. Compare the results of the |ann| query with the results of the |enn|
   query to evaluate the similarities and differences in the results.

This section demonstrates how to perform the preceding 3 steps against
data in the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` collection. If you don't
wish to use the sample dataset, you can perform the procedures against
your own data. 

Create the {+avs+} Index 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section demonstrates how to create an {+avs+} index for running
{+avs+} |ann| and |enn| queries. 

.. |search-type| replace:: :guilabel:`Vector Search`
.. |index-name| replace:: ``vector_index``
.. |database-name| replace:: ``sample_mflix`` database 
.. |collection-name| replace:: ``embedded_movies`` collection
.. |avs-namespace| replace:: ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies``
.. |embedding-field-name| replace:: ``plot_embedding``
.. |similarity-method| replace:: :guilabel:`Euclidean`
.. |quantization-method| replace:: :guilabel:`Binary`
.. |filter-fields| replace:: ``genres`` field
