Overview
--------

Welcome to MMS. Use this tutorial to create an MMS account and install a
MongoDB deployment of any size and for any purpose. You can use MMS to
deploy MongoDB locally, on a network, or in the cloud. You can deploy for
testing, training, development, production, or any other purpose.

During setup, you configure your MMS account, including whether to include
the Backup service, and configure the MongoDB deployment. You choose
whether to deploy as :term:`standalone`, :term:`replica set`, or
:term:`sharded cluster`. Any configuration choice you make can be easily
changed once your deployment is up and running.

The setup process here creates one deployment. Once you are up and
running, you can create and manage as many deployments as you would like.
You can create different deployments with entirely different
configurations. You can scale out, add users, retire servers, and perform
full database administration.
