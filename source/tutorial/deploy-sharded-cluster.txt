:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` provide horizontal scaling
for large data sets and enable high throughput operations by
distributing the data set across a group of servers.

To learn more about sharding, see
:manual:`Sharding Introduction </core/sharding-introduction>` in the
MongoDB manual.

Use this procedure to deploy a new sharded cluster that |mms| manages.
Later, you can use |mms| to add shards and perform other maintenance
operations on the cluster.

Considerations
--------------

Unique Names for Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use unique names for the new cluster and its shards.

Configuration Server Deployment Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. cond:: onprem

   .. versionadded:: Ops Manager 4.0

      If you select MongoDB 3.2 or later for your configuration server
      |mongod| processes, |mms| deploys your configuration servers as a
      replica set. If you select replica set. MongoDB 3.0 or earlier
      for your configuration server |mongod| processes, |mms| deploys
      mirrored configuration servers.

.. cond:: cloud

   If you select MongoDB 3.4 or later for your configuration server
   |mongod| processes, |mms| deploys your configuration servers as a
   replica set.

To learn more about |csrs| and mirrored configuration servers (|sccc|),
see :manual:`Config Servers </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers/>`.
