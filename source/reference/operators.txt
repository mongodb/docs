Query Selectors
---------------

.. index:: query selectors; comparison
.. _query-selectors-comparison:

Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~

.. operator:: $lt

   The :operator:`$lt` comparison operator provides the ability to select
   documents where a field is less than (e.g. ``<``) a value:

   .. code-block:: javascript

       db.collection.find( { field: { $lt: value } } );

   This query returns all documents in ``collection`` where a value
   of ``field`` is less than the specified ``value``.

.. operator:: $gt

   The :operator:`$gt` comparison operator provides the ability to select
   documents where a field is greater than (e.g. ``>``) a value:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $gt: value } } );

   This query returns all documents in ``collection`` where a value
   of ``field`` is greater than the specified ``value``.

   If ``field`` holds an array, only one value in the array needs to
   be greater than the specified ``value`` to produce a successful
   match.

.. operator:: $lte

   The :operator:`$lte` comparison operator provides the ability to select
   documents where a field is less than or equal to (e.g. ``<=``) a
   value:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $lte: value } } );

   This query returns all documents in ``collection`` where the value
   of ``field`` less than or equal to the specified ``value``.

.. operator:: $gte

   The :operator:`$gte` comparison operator provides the ability to select
   documents where a field is greater than or equal to (e.g. ``>=``) a
   value:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $gte: value } } );

   This query returns all documents in ``collection`` where the value
   of ``field`` greater than or equal to the specified ``value``.

You may combine comparison operators to specify ranges:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { field: { $gt: value1, $lt: value2 } } );

This statement returns all documents with ``field`` between
``value1`` and ``value2``.

.. note::

   Fields containing arrays match conditional operators, if only one
   item matches. Therefore, the following query:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $gt:0, $lt:2 } } );

   Will match a document that contains the following field:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { field: [-1,3] }

.. index:: query selectors; document
.. _query-selectors-document:

Document
~~~~~~~~

.. operator:: $all

   The :operator:`$all` operator matches a minimum set of elements that must
   be present in a document's ``field``, as in the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $all: [ 1, 2 , 3 ] } } );

   This returns all documents in ``collection`` where the value of
   ``field`` is an array that is equivalent to or a superset of ``[
   1, 2, 3, ]``. The :operator:`$all` operator will not return any arrays
   that are subsets; for example, the above query matches ``{ field: [
   1, 2, 3, 4] }`` but not ``{ field: [ 2, 3 ] }``.

   .. note::

      In most cases, MongoDB does not treat arrays as sets. This
      operator provides a notable exception to this general approach

.. operator:: $exists

   The :operator:`$exists` operator tests documents for the existence
   of a field. The :operator:`$exists` operator accepts either true and
   false values. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        db.collection.find( { field: { $exists: true } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` that have ``field``, while:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $exists: false } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` that do *not* have ``field``
   specified.

.. operator:: $ne

   The :operator:`$ne` operator returns documents where a field is not
   equal to the specified value. The following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $ne: 100 } } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` with ``field`` that does not
   equal 100.

.. operator:: $in

   The :operator:`$in` operator allows you to specify a set of possible
   matches for any value. Consider the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $in: array } } );

   Here, :operator:`$in` returns all documents in ``collection`` where
   ``field`` has a value included in ``array``. This is analogous to
   the ``IN`` modifier in SQL. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { age: { $in: [ 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 } } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` with an ``age`` field
   that is *one* of the first six prime numbers, including all of the
   following documents:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { age: 7 }
      { age: 11 }
      { age: 3 }

   When the field that :operator:`$in` inspects (i.e. ``age`` in the
   above example) is itself an array, only *one* of the values in the
   array must match *one* of the values in the :operator:`$in`
   array. Therefore, the following query:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { a: { $in: [1, 2] } } )

   will match both of the following documents:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { a: [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ] }
      { a: [ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 ] }

.. operator:: $nin

   The :operator:`$nin` operator provides a "not in," as the inverse of
   :operator:`$in`. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { age: { $nin: [ 3, 5, 7 } } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` where the value of ``age``
   is *not* 3, 5, or 7.


.. index:: query selectors; geospatial
.. _query-selectors-geospatial:
.. _geospatial-query-operators:
.. _geolocation-operators:

Geospatial
~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   A geospatial index *must* exist on a field holding coordinates
   before using any of the geolocation query operators.

.. operator:: $near

   The :operator:`$near` operator takes an argument, coordinates in
   the form of ``[x, y]``, and returns a list of objects sorted
   by distance from those coordinates. See the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { location: { $near: [100,100] } } );

   This query will return 100 ordered records with a ``location``
   field in ``collection``. Specify a different limit using the
   :func:`cursor.limit()`, or another :ref:`geolocation operator
   <geolocation-operators>`, or a non-geospatial operator to limit the
   results of the query.

.. operator:: $maxDistance

   The :operator:`$maxDistance` operator specifies an upper bound to limit
   the results of a geolocation query. See below, where the
   :operator:`$maxDistance` operator narrows the results of the
   :operator:`$near` query:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { location: { $near: [100,100], $maxDistance: 10 } } );

   This query will return documents with ``location`` fields from
   ``collection`` that have values with a distance of 5 or fewer units
   from the point ``[100,100]``. :operator:`$near` returns results
   ordered by their distance from ``[100,100]``. This operation will
   return the first 100 results unless you modify the query with the
   :func:`cursor.limit()` method.

   Specify the value of the :operator:`$maxDistance` argument in the
   same units as the document coordinate system.

.. operator:: $within

   The :operator:`$within` operator allows you to select items that exist
   within a shape on a coordinate system. This operator uses the
   following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { location: { $within: { shape } } } );

   Replace ``{ shape }`` with a document that describes a shape. The
   :operator:`$within` command supports three shapes. These shapes and the
   relevant expressions follow:

   - Rectangles. Use the :operator:`$box` shape, consider the following
     variable and :operator:`$within` document:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.collection.find( { location: { $within: { $box: [[100,0], [120,100]] } } } );

     Here a box, ``[[100,120], [100,0]]`` describes the parameter
     for the query. As a minimum, you must specify the lower-left and
     upper-right corners of the box.

   - Circles. Specify circles in the following form:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.collection.find( { location: { $within: { $circle: [ center, radius } } } );

   - Polygons. Specify polygons with an array of points. See the
     following example:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.collection.find( { location: { $within: { $box: [[100,120], [100,100], [120,100], [240,200]] } } } );

     The last point of a polygon is implicitly connected to the first
     point.

   All shapes include the border of the shape as part of the shape,
   although this is subject to the imprecision of floating point
   numbers.

.. operator:: $uniqueDocs

   When using the :dbcommand:`geoNear`, if document contains more than
   one field with coordinate values, MongoDB will return the same
   document multiple times. When using the :operator:`$within`,
   however, MongoDB provides opposite behavior: if a document contains
   more than one field with coordinate values, MongoDB will only
   return the document once.

   The :operator:`$uniqueDocs` operator overrides these default
   behaviors.

   By specifying ``$uniqueDocs: false`` in a :operator:`$within`
   query, will cause the query to return a single document multiple
   times if there is more than one match.

   By contrast, if you specify ``uniqueDocs: true`` as an option to
   the a :dbcommand:`geoNear` command, then :dbcommand:`geoNear` only
   returns a single document even if there are multiple matches.

   You cannot specify :operator:`$uniqueDocs` with :operator:`$near`
   or haystack queries.

.. index:: query selectors; logical
.. _query-selectors-logical:

Logical
~~~~~~~

.. operator:: $or

   .. versionadded:: 1.6

   The :operator:`$or` operator provides a Boolean ``OR`` expression in
   queries. Use :operator:`$or` to match documents against two or more
   expressions. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { $or [ { key1: value1 }, { key2: value2} ] } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` that *either* have a
   ``key1`` field with ``value1`` *or* a ``key2`` field with ``value2``.

   You may specify a field and then use the :operator:`$or` operator to
   further narrow results. Consider the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { age: "19", $or [ { key1: value1 }, { key2: value2} ] } );

   This query returns all documents in ``collection`` with an ``age``
   field that has the value ``19``, and *either* a ``key1`` field with
   ``value1`` *or* a ``key2`` field with ``value2``.

   .. versionadded:: 2.0
      You may nest :operator:`$or` operations; however, these
      expressions are not as efficiently optimized as top-level
      :operator:`$or` operations.

.. operator:: $nor

   The :operator:`$nor` operators provides a Boolean ``NOR`` expression in
   queries. :operator:`$nor` is the functional inverse of :operator:`$or`. Use
   :operator:`$nor` to exclude documents that have fields with specific
   values. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { $nor [ { key1: value1 }, { key2: value2} ] } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` that have *neither* a
   ``key1`` field with ``value1`` *nor* a ``key2`` field with
   ``value2``.

.. operator:: $and

   .. versionadded:: 2.0

   The :operator:`$and` operator provides a Boolean ``AND`` expression in
   queries. Use :operator:`$and` to return the documents that satisfy *all*
   included expressions. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { $and [ { key1: value1 }, { key2: value2} ] } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` that have *both* a
   ``key1`` field with ``value1`` *and* a ``key2`` field with
   ``value2``.

.. operator:: $not

   :operator:`$not` is a meta operator used to reverse the operation
   of a standard operator. If a document does not match a query statement,
   passing that query statement to the :operator:`$not` will return
   that document. The operation of :operator:`$not` is consistent with
   the behavior of other operators, but may yield unexpected results
   with some data types, like arrays.

   :operator:`$not` only affects *other operators*, and is unable to
   check fields and documents independently. Use :operator:`$ne` to
   test the contents of fields directly and :operator:`$nor` for
   logical disjunctions.

   Consider the following example of :operator:`$not`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $not: { $type: 2 } } } );

   This query returns all documents in ``collection`` where ``field``
   is *not* a string, using the :operator:`$type` operator.

   .. note::

      The :operator:`$not` operator does not support operations with
      :operator:`$regex`.

      When using :operator:`$not`, pass all regular expressions using
      the native BSON type. For example, consider the following
      expression fragment  in Python, using the PyMongo driver:

      .. code-block:: python

        { "$not": re.compile("acme.*corp")}

   .. see:: The :operator:`$type` operator, used in the above example.

.. index:: query selectors; element
.. _query-selectors-element:

Element
~~~~~~~

.. operator:: $type

   The :operator:`$type` operator matches field values with a specific data
   type. :operator:`$type` operator allows you to narrow results based on any
   :term:`BSON` type. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        db.collection.find( { field: { $type: 2 } } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` where the value of
   ``field`` is a string. Consider the following chart for the
   available types and their corresponding numbers.

   =======================  ==========
   **Type**                 **Number**

   =======================  ==========

   ``MinKey`` and ``MaxKey`` compare less than and greater than all
   other possible :term:`BSON` element values, respectively, and exist
   primarily for internal use.

   .. note::

      Queries for ``MaxKey`` using the :operator:`$type` work as
      expected; however, to query for ``MinKey`` you must specify
      ``-1`` as in the following example:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.collection.find( { field: { $type: -1 } } )

      Query statements cannot use :operator:`$type` to test arrays
      (i.e. ``4``.) Instead, use the :operator:`$where` operator that
      resembles the following:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.collection.find( { field: { $where : "Array.isArray(this.field)" } } )

      See the :issue:`SERVER-1475` for more information about the
      array type.

   .. example::

      Consider the following example operation sequence that
      demonstrates both type comparison *and* the special ``MinKey``
      and ``MaxKey`` values:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.test.insert( {x : 3});
         db.test.insert( {x : 2.9} );
         db.test.insert( {x : new Date()} );
         db.test.insert( {x : true } );
         db.test.insert( {x : MaxKey } )
         db.test.insert( {x : MinKey } )

         db.test.find().sort({x:1})
         { "_id" : ObjectId("4b04094b7c65b846e2090112"), "x" : { $minKey : 1 } }
         { "_id" : ObjectId("4b03155dce8de6586fb002c7"), "x" : 2.9 }
         { "_id" : ObjectId("4b03154cce8de6586fb002c6"), "x" : 3 }
         { "_id" : ObjectId("4b031566ce8de6586fb002c9"), "x" : true }
         { "_id" : ObjectId("4b031563ce8de6586fb002c8"), "x" : "Tue Jul 25 2012 18:42:03 GMT-0500 (EST)" }
         { "_id" : ObjectId("4b0409487c65b846e2090111"), "x" : { $maxKey : 1 } }

      To query for the minimum value of a :term:`shard key` of a
      :term:`shard cluster`, use the following operation when
      connected to the :program:`mongos`:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         use config
         db.chunks.find( { "min.shardKey": { $type: -1 } } )

   .. include:: /includes/warning-mixing-types.rst

.. operator:: $regex

   The :operator:`$regex` operator provides regular expression
   capabilities in queries. MongoDB uses Perl compatible regular
   expressions (i.e. "PCRE."))The following examples are equivalent:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: /acme.*corp/i } );
      db.collection.find( { field: { $regex: 'acme.*corp', $options: 'i' } } );

   These expressions match all documents in ``collection`` where the
   value of ``field`` matches the case-insensitive regular expression
   ``acme.*corp``.

   :operator:`$regex` uses "Perl Compatible Regular Expressions" (PCRE) as the
   matching engine.

   .. operator:: $options

     :operator:`$regex` provides four option flags:

     - ``i`` toggles case insensitivity, and allows all letters in the
       pattern to match upper and lower cases.

     - ``m`` toggles multiline regular expression. Without this option,
       all regular expression match within one line.

       If there are no newline characters (e.g. ``\n``) or no
       start/end of line construct, the ``m`` option has no effect.

     - ``x`` toggles an "extended" capability. When set,
       :operator:`$regex` ignores all white space characters unless
       escaped or included in a character class.

       Additionally, it ignores characters between an un-escaped ``#``
       character and the next new line, so that you may include
       comments in complicated patterns. This only applies to data
       characters; white space characters may never appear within
       special character sequences in a pattern.

       The ``x`` option does not affect the handling of the VT character
       (i.e. code 11.)

     .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

     - ``s`` allows the dot (e.g. ``.``) character to match all
       characters *including* newline characters.

     :option:`$regex` only provides the ``i` and ``m`` options in the
     short JavaScript syntax (i.e. ``/acme.*corp/i``). To use ``x``
     and ``s`` you must use the ":operator:`$regex`" operator with the
     ":operator:`$options`" syntax.

   To combine a regular expression match with other operators, you
   need to specify the ":operator:`$regex`" operator. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: $regex: /acme.*corp/i, $nin: [ 'acmeblahcorp' } );

   This expression returns all instances of ``field`` in
   ``collection`` that match the case insensitive regular expression
   ``acme.*corp`` that *don't* match ``acmeblahcorp``.

   :operator:`$regex` uses :term:`indexes <index>` only when the
   regular expression has an anchor for the beginning (i.e. ``^``)
   of a string. Additionally, while ``/^a/``, ``/^a.*/``, and
   ``/^a.*$/`` are equivalent, they have different performance
   characteristics. All of these expressions use an index if an
   appropriate index exists; however, ``/^a.*/``, and ``/^a.*$/``
   are slower. ``/^a/`` can stop scanning after matching the prefix.

.. operator:: $mod

   The :operator:`$mod` operator performs a fast "modulo" query, to
   reduce the need for expensive :operator:`$where` operator in some
   cases. :operator:`$mod` performs a modulo operation on the value of
   a field, and returns all documents that with the specified remainder value. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $mod: [ d, m ] } } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` with a remainder of ``m``,
   with a divisor of ``d``. This replaces the following
   :operator:`$where` operation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( "field % d == m" );

.. index:: query selectors; javascript
.. _query-selectors-javascript:

JavaScript
~~~~~~~~~~

.. operator:: $where

   Use the :operator:`$where` operator to pass a string containing a
   JavaScript expression to the query system to provide greater
   flexibility with queries. Consider the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { $where: "this.a == this.b" } );

   .. warning::

      :operator:`$where` evaluates JavaScript and cannot take
      advantage of indexes.  Therefore, query performance improves
      when you express your query using the standard MongoDB operators
      (e.g., :operator:`$gt`, :operator:`$in`).

      In general, you should use :operator:`$where` only when you
      can't express your query using another operator.  If you must
      use :operator:`$where`, try to include at least one other
      standard query operator to filter the result set. Using
      :operator:`$where` alone requires a table scan.

.. index:: query selectors; array
.. _query-selectors-array:

Array
~~~~~

.. operator:: $size

   The :operator:`$size` operator matches any array with the number of
   elements specified by the argument. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $size: 2 } } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` where ``field`` is an array
   with 2 or more elements. For instance, the above expression will
   return ``{ field: [ red, green ] }`` and ``{ field: [ apple,
   lime ] }`` but *not* ``{ field: fruit }`` or ``{ field: [
   orange, lemon, grapefruit ] }``. To match fields with only one
   element within an array use :operator:`$size` with a value of 1, as
   follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $size: 1 } } );

   :operator:`$size` does not accept ranges of values. To select
   documents based on fields with different numbers of elements,
   create a counter field that you increment when you add elements to
   a field.

   Queries cannot use indexes for the :operator:`$size` portion of a
   query, although the other portions of a query can use indexes if
   applicable.

.. operator:: $elemMatch

   .. versionadded:: 1.4

   The :operator:`$elemMatch` operator matches more than one component within
   an array element. For example,

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { array: { $elemMatch: { value1: 1, value2: { $gt: 1 } } } } );

   returns all documents in ``collection`` where the array ``array``
   satisfies all of the conditions in the :operator:`$elemMatch`
   expression, or where the value of ``value1`` is 1 and the value of
   ``value2`` is greater than 1. Matching arrays must have one element
   that matches all specified criteria. Therefore, the following
   document would not match the above query:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { array: [ { value1:1, value2:0 }, { value1:2, value2:2 } ] }

   while the following document would match this query:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { array: [ { value1:1, value2:0 }, { value1:1, value2:2 } ] }

Fields
~~~~~~

.. operator:: $set

  Use the :operator:`$set` operator to set a particular value. The
  :operator:`$set` operator requires the following syntax:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.collection.update( { field: value1 }, { $set: { field1: value2 } } );

  This statement updates in the document in ``collection`` where
  ``field`` matches ``value1`` by replacing the value of the field
  ``field1`` with ``value2``. This operator will add the specified
  field or fields if they do not exist in this document *or* replace
  the existing value of the specified field(s) if they already exist.

.. operator:: $unset

   The :operator:`$unset` operator deletes a particular field. Consider the
   following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( { field: value1 }, { $unset: { field1: "" } } );

   The above example deletes ``field1`` in ``collection`` from
   documents where ``field`` has a value of ``value1``. The value of
   specified for the value of the field in the :operator:`$unset` statement
   (i.e. ``""`` above,) does not impact the operation.

   If documents match the initial query (e.g. ``{ field: value1 }``
   above) but do not have the field specified in the :operator:`$unset`
   operation, (e.g. ``field1``) there the statement has no effect on
   the document.

.. operator:: $inc

   The :operator:`$inc` operator increments a value by a specified
   amount if field is present in the document. If the field does not
   exist, :operator:`$inc` sets field to the number value. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( { field: value }, { $inc: { field1: amount } } );

   In this example, for documents in ``collection`` where
   ``field`` has the value ``value``, the value of ``field1``
   increments by the value of ``amount``. The above operation only
   increments the *first* matching document *unless* you specify
   multi-update:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( { age: 20 }, { $inc: { age: 1 } } );
      db.collection.update( { name: "John" }, { $inc: { age: 1 } } );

   In the first example all documents that have an ``age`` field with
   the value of ``20``, the operation increases ``age`` field by
   one. In the second example, in all documents where the ``name``
   field has a value of ``John`` the operation increases the value
   of the ``age`` field by one.

   :operator:`$inc` accepts positive and negative incremental amounts.

.. operator:: $rename

  The :operator:`$rename` operator changes the name of a field. Consider the
  following example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.collection.update( { field: value }, { $rename: { old_field: new_field  } } );

  Here, the :operator:`$rename` operator changes the name of the ``old_field``
  field to ``new_field``, in the document that matches the query ``{
  field: value }`` in ``collection``.

  The :operator:`$rename` operator will expand arrays and
  sub-documents to find a match for field names (e.g. ``old_field``
  in the example above.)

Array
~~~~~

.. operator:: $push

   The :operator:`$push` operator appends a specified value to an array. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( { field: value }, { $push: { field: value1 } } );

   Here, :operator:`$push` appends ``value1`` to the array identified by
   ``value`` in ``field``. Be aware of the following behaviors:

   - If the field specified in the :operator:`$push` statement
     (e.g. ``{ $push: { field: value1 } }``) does not exist in the
     matched document, the operation adds a new array with the
     specified field and value (e.g. ``value1``) to the matched
     document.

   - The operation will fail if the field specified in the
     :operator:`$push` statement is *not* an array. :operator:`$push`
     does not fail when pushing a value to a non-existent field.

   - If ``value1`` is an array itself, :operator:`$push` appends the whole array as an
     element in the identified array. To add multiple items to an
     array, use :operator:`$pushAll`.

.. operator:: $pushAll

   The :operator:`$pushAll` operator is similar to the :operator:`$push` but
   adds the ability to append several values to an array at once.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( { field: value }, { $pushAll: { field1: [ value1, value2, value3 ] } } );

   Here, :operator:`$pushAll` appends the values in ``[ value1, value2,
   value3 ]`` to the array in ``field1`` in the document
   matched by the statement ``{ field: value }`` in ``collection``.

   If you specify a single value, :operator:`$pushAll` will behave as
   :operator:`$push`.

.. operator:: $addToSet

   The :operator:`$addToSet` operator adds a value to an array only *if* the
   value is *not* in the array already. If the value *is* in the
   array, :operator:`$addToSet` returns without modifying the
   array. Otherwise, :operator:`$addToSet` behaves the same as
   :operator:`$push`. Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( { field: value }, { $addToSet: { field: value1 } } );

   Here, :operator:`$addToSet` appends ``value1`` to the array stored in
   ``field``, *only if* ``value1`` is not already a member of this
   array.

   .. operator:: $each

      The :operator:`$each` is available within the
      :operator:`$addToSet`, which allows you to add multiple values
      to the array if they do not exist in the ``field`` array in a
      single operation. Consider the following prototype:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.collection.update( { field: value }, { $addToSet: { field: { $each : [ value1, value2, value3 ] } } } );

.. operator:: $pop

   The :operator:`$pop` operator removes the first or last element of an
   array. Pass :operator:`$pop` a value of ``1``` to remove the last element
   in an array and a value of ``-1`` to remove the first element of an
   array. Consider the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( {field: value }, { $pop: { field: 1 } } );

   This operation removes the last item of the array in ``field``  in
   the document that matches the query statement ``{ field: value
   }``. The following example removes the *first* item of the same
   array:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( {field: value }, { $pop: { field: -1 } } );

   Be aware of the following :operator:`$pop` behaviors:

   - The :operator:`$pop` operation fails if ``field`` is not an
     array.

   - :operator:`$pop` will successfully remove the last item in an
     array. ``field`` will then hold an empty array.

   .. versionadded:: 1.1

.. operator:: $pull

   The :operator:`$pull` operator removes all instances of a value
   from an existing array. Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( { field: value }, { $pull: { field: value1 } } );

   :operator:`$pull` removes the value ``value1`` from the array in ``field``,
   in the document that matches the query statement ``{ field: value
   }`` in ``collection``. If ``value1`` existed multiple times in the
   ``field`` array, :operator:`pull` would remove all instances of
   ``value1`` in this array.

.. operator:: $pullAll

   The :operator:`$pullAll` operator removes multiple values from an existing
   array. :operator:`$pullAll` provides the inverse operation of the
   :operator:`$pushAll` operator. Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( { field: value }, { $pullAll: { field1: [ value1, value2, value3 ] } } );

   Here, :operator:`$pullAll` removes ``[ value1, value2, value3 ]`` from
   the array in ``field1``, in the document that matches the
   query statement ``{ field: value }`` in ``collection``.

.. index:: update operators; bitwise

Bitwise
~~~~~~~

.. operator:: $bit

   The :operator:`$bit` operator performs a bitwise update of a field. Only
   use this with integer fields. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( { field: 1 }, { $bit: { field: { and: 5 } } } );

   Here, the :operator:`$bit` operator updates the integer value of the field
   named ``field`` with a bitwise ``and: 5`` operation. This
   operator only works with number types.

.. index:: update operators; isolation

.. _update-operators-isolation:

Isolation
~~~~~~~~~

.. operator:: $atomic

   In multi-update mode, it's possible to specify an
   :operator:`$atomic` "operator" that allows you to **isolate** some
   updates from each other within this operation. Consider the
   following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.foo.update( { field1 : 1 , $atomic : 1 }, { $inc : { field2 : 1 } } ,  false , true )

   Without the :operator:`$atomic` operator, multi-updates will allow
   other operations to interleave with this updates. If these
   interleaved operations contain writes, the update operation may
   produce unexpected results. By specifying :operator:`$atomic` you
   can guarantee isolation for the entire multi-update.

   .. seealso:: See :func:`db.collection.update()` for more information about the
      :func:`db.collection.update()` method.

.. index:: projection operators
.. _projection-operators:

Projection
----------

.. operator:: $slice

   The :operator:`$slice` operator controls the number of items of an array
   that a query returns. Consider the following prototype query:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: value }, { array: {$slice: count } } );

   This operation selects the document ``collection`` identified by a
   field named ``field`` that holds ``value`` and returns the number
   of elements specified by the value of ``count`` from the array
   stored in the ``array`` field. If ``count`` has a value greater
   than the number of elements in ``array`` the query returns all
   elements of the array.

   :operator:`$slice` accepts arguments in a number of formats,
   including negative values and arrays. Consider the following
   examples:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.posts.find( {}, { comments: { $slice: 5 } } )

   Here, :operator:`$slice` selects the first five items in an array
   in the ``comments`` field.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.posts.find( {}, { comments: { $slice: -5 } } )

   This operation returns the last five items in array.

   The following examples specify an array as an argument to
   slice. Arrays take the form of ``[ skip , limit ]``, where the
   first value indicates the number of items in the array to skip and
   the second value indicates the number of items to return.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.posts.find( {}, { comments: { $slice: [ 20, 10 ] } } )

   Here, the query will only return 10 items, after skipping the first
   20 items of that array.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.posts.find( {}, { comments: { $slice: [ -20, 10 ] } } )

   This operation returns 10 items as well, beginning with the item
   that is 20th from the last item of the array.
