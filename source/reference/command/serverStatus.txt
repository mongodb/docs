Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: serverStatus

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns a document that
   provides an overview of the database's state. Monitoring
   applications can run this command at a regular interval to
   collect statistics about the instance.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( 
      { 
        serverStatus: 1 
      } 
   )

The value (i.e. ``1`` above) does not affect the operation of the
command. The ``db.serverStatus()`` command returns a large amount of
data. To return a specific object or field from the output append the
object or field name to the command.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand({ serverStatus: 1}).metrics
   db.runCommand({ serverStatus: 1}).metrics.commands
   db.runCommand({ serverStatus: 1}).metrics.commands.update

:binary:`~bin.mongosh` provides the :method:`db.serverStatus()`
wrapper for the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command.

.. seealso::

   Much of the output of :dbcommand:`serverStatus` is also displayed
   dynamically by :binary:`~bin.mongostat`. See the
   :binary:`~bin.mongostat` command for more information.

Behavior
--------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/serverStatus-command-projection.rst

For example, the following operation excludes the ``repl``,
``metrics`` and ``locks`` information in the output.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, repl: 0, metrics: 0, locks: 0 } )


For example, the following operation excludes the embedded ``histogram`` 
field in the output.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, metrics: { query: { multiPlanner: { histograms: false } } } } )

The following example includes
all :ref:`server-status-repl` information in the output:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1,  repl: 1 } )

Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The statistics reported by :dbcommand:`serverStatus` are reset when the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` server is restarted.

This command will always return a value, even on a fresh database. The
related command :method:`db.serverStatus()` does not always return a
value unless a counter has started to increment for a particular
metric.

After you run an update query, ``db.serverStatus()`` and
``db.runCommand({ serverStatus: 1})`` both return the same values.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      arrayFilters : Long("0"),
      failed : Long("0"),
      pipeline : Long("0"),
      total : Long("1")
   }

Include ``mirroredReads``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the :serverstatus:`mirroredReads` information is not included in 
the output. To return :serverstatus:`mirroredReads` information, you must 
explicitly specify the inclusion:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, mirroredReads: 1 } )

.. _server-status-output:

Output
------

.. note::

   The output fields vary depending on the version of MongoDB,
   underlying operating system platform, the storage engine, and the
   kind of node, including :binary:`~bin.mongos`, :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
   :term:`replica set` member.

   For the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` output specific to the version of
   your MongoDB, refer to the appropriate version of the MongoDB Manual.

.. _server-status-asserts:

asserts
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   asserts: {
      regular: <num>,
      warning: <num>,
      msg: <num>,
      user: <num>,
      rollovers: <num>
   },

.. serverstatus:: asserts

   A document that reports on the number of assertions raised since the
   MongoDB process started. Assertions are internal checks for errors that 
   occur while the database is operating and can help diagnose issues with the 
   MongoDB server. Non-zero asserts values indicate assertion errors, which are 
   uncommon and not an immediate cause for concern. Errors that generate asserts 
   can be recorded in the log file or returned directly to a client application 
   for more information.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.regular

   The number of regular assertions raised since the MongoDB process
   started. Examine the MongoDB log for more information.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.warning

   This field always returns zero ``0``.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.msg

   The number of message assertions raised since the MongoDB process
   started. Examine the log file for more information about these
   messages.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.user

   The number of "user asserts" that have occurred since the last time
   the MongoDB process started. These are errors that user may
   generate, such as out of disk space or duplicate key. You can
   prevent these assertions by fixing a problem with your application
   or deployment. Examine the log file for more information about these
   messages.

.. serverstatus:: asserts.rollovers

   The number of times that the assert counters have rolled over
   since the last time the MongoDB process started. The counters will
   roll over to zero after 2\ :superscript:`30` assertions. Use this
   value to provide context to the other values in the
   :serverstatus:`asserts` data structure.

.. versionadded:: 5.0

A document that reports metrics related to the :ref:`internal storage of
time series collections <timeseries-bucket-catalog>`.

      ``metaField`` value that didn't match any currently open buckets.
  
  * - ``numBucketsClosedDueToCount``
  
    - The number of buckets closed due to reaching their document count limit.

  * - ``numBucketsClosedDueToSchemaChange``

  * - ``numBucketsClosedDueToSize``
  
    - The number of buckets closed because an incoming document would make the
      bucket exceed its size limit.
  
  * - ``numBucketsClosedDueToTimeForward``
  
    - The number of buckets closed because a document arrived with a
      ``timeField`` value after the maximum time of all currently open buckets 
      for that ``metaField`` value.

  * - ``numBucketsClosedDueToTimeBackward``

    - The number of buckets closed because a document arrived with a
      ``timeField`` value before the minimum time of all currently open 
      buckets for that ``metaField`` value.

    - The number of buckets closed because a suitable bucket was re-opened 
      instead.

  * - ``numBucketsArchivedDueToMemoryThreshold``
    
    - The number of buckets archived because the set of active buckets didn't
      fit within the allowed bucket catalog cache size.

  * - ``numBucketsArchivedDueToTimeBackward``

    - The number of buckets archived because a document arrived with a
      ``timeField`` value before the minimum time of all currently open 
      buckets for that ``metaField`` value.

  * - ``numBucketsReopened``

    - The number of buckets re-opened because a document arrived that didn't
      match any open buckets, but did match an existing non-full bucket.

  * - ``numBucketsKeptOpenDueToLargeMeasurements``

    - The number of buckets that would have been closed due size, but were kept
      open due to not containing a minimum number of documents required to
      achieve reasonable compression.

  * - ``numBucketsClosedDueToCachePressure``

    - The number of buckets closed because their size exceeds the bucket
      catalog's dynamic :ref:`bucket size limit <timeseries-bucket-closure>`
      derived from available storage engine cache size and ``numBuckets``. This
      limit is distinct from the maximum bucket size limit.

  * - ``numBucketsFrozen``

    - The number of frozen buckets. Buckets are frozen if attempting to 
      compress the bucket would corrupt its contents.
  
  * - ``numCompressedBucketsConvertedToUnsorted``

    - The number of compressed buckets that contain documents not sorted by 
      their respective ``timeField`` values.
  
  * - ``numBucketsFetched``

    - The number of archived buckets fetched to check if they were suitable
      for re-opening.
  
  * - ``numBucketsQueried``

    - The total number of buckets queried to see if they could hold an  
      incoming document.
  
  * - ``numBucketFetchesFailed``

    - The number of archived buckets fetched that were not suitable for 
      re-opening.
  
  * - ``numBucketQueriesFailed``

    - The number of queries for a suitable open bucket that failed due to
      lack of candidate availability.
  
  * - ``numBucketReopeningsFailed``

    - The number of attempted bucket reopenings that failed due to reasons 
      including conflicts with concurrent operations, malformed buckets, and 
      more.
  
  * - ``numDuplicateBucketsReopened``

    -  The number of re-opened buckets that are duplicates of currently open
       buckets.

  * - ``stateManagement``

    - A document that tracks bucket catalog state information.
  
  * - ``stateManagement.bucketsManaged``

    - The total number of buckets that are being tracked for conflict 
      management. This includes open buckets in the bucket catalog as well as 
      any buckets that are being directly written to, including by update and 
      delete commands.
  
  * - ``stateManagement.currentEra``

    - The current era of the bucket catalog. The bucket catalog starts
      at era 0 and increments when a bucket is cleared. Attempting to insert
      into a bucket will either cause it to be removed if it was cleared, or
      update it to the current era.
  
  * - ``stateManagement.erasWithRemainingBuckets``

    - The number of eras with tracked buckets.
  
  * - ``stateManagement.trackedClearOperations``

    - The number of times the a set of buckets has been cleared, but the 
      removal of those buckets was deferred. This can happen due to events such
      as dropping a collection, moving a chunk in a sharded collection, or an  
      election.

.. serverstatus:: changeStreamPreImages.purgingJob

   .. versionadded:: 7.1

   A document that reports metrics related to the purging jobs for
   change stream pre-images. Purging jobs are background processes 
   that the system uses to remove pre-images asynchronously.

   The ``changeStreamPreImages.purgingJob`` field returns the 
   following metrics:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

          ``totalPass`` since each tenant has one pre-image collection.

      * - ``scannedInternalCollections``
        - Cumulative number of internal pre-image collections scanned by the 
          purging job. Internal collections are the collections within the pre-image
          collections stored in ``config.system.preimages``.

.. serverstatus:: flowControl

   A document that returns statistics on the :ref:`flow-control`. With
   flow control enabled, as the :data:`majority commit
   <replSetGetStatus.optimes.lastCommittedOpTime>` point lag grows
   close to the :parameter:`flowControlTargetLagSeconds`, writes on the
   primary must obtain tickets before taking locks. As such, the
   metrics returned are meaningful when run on the primary.

.. serverstatus:: flowControl.enabled

   A boolean that indicates whether :ref:`flow-control` is
   enabled (``true``) or disabled (``false``).
   
   See also :parameter:`enableFlowControl`.

   When run on a secondary, the returned number is a placeholder.

.. serverstatus:: flowControl.sustainerRate

   When run on the primary, an approximation of operations applied per
   second by the secondary that is sustaining the commit point.

   When run on a secondary, the returned number is a placeholder.

.. serverstatus:: flowControl.isLagged

   When run on the primary, a boolean that indicates whether flow
   control has engaged. Flow control engages when the majority
   committed lag is greater than some percentage of the configured
   :parameter:`flowControlTargetLagSeconds`.

   Replication lag can occur without engaging flow control.
   An unresponsive :term:`secondary` might lag without the replica set
   receiving sufficient load to engage flow control, leaving 
   the :serverstatus:`flowControl.isLagged` value at ``false``.

   For additional information, see :ref:`Flow Control <flow-control>`.

.. serverstatus:: flowControl.isLaggedCount

   When run on a primary, the number of times flow control has engaged
   since the last restart. Flow control engages when the majority
   committed lag is greater than some percentage of the
   :parameter:`flowControlTargetLagSeconds`.

   When run on a secondary, the returned number is a placeholder.

.. serverstatus:: flowControl.isLaggedTimeMicros

   When run on the primary, the amount of time flow control has spent
   being engaged since the last restart. Flow control engages when the
   majority committed lag is greater than some percentage of the
   :parameter:`flowControlTargetLagSeconds`.

.. serverstatus:: metrics

   A document that returns various statistics that reflect the current
   use and state of a running :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.abortExpiredTransactions

   Document that returns statistics on the current state of the
   ``abortExpiredTransactions`` thread.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.abortExpiredTransactions.passes

   Indicates the number of successful passes aborting transactions
   older than the :parameter:`transactionLifetimeLimitSeconds` parameter.

   If the ``passes`` value stops incrementing, it indicates that the
   ``abortExpiredTransactions`` thread may be stuck.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.aggStageCounters

   A document that reports on the use of
   :ref:`aggregation pipeline stages 
   <aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>`. The fields in 
   :serverstatus:`metrics.aggStageCounters` are the names of 
   aggregation pipeline stages. For each pipeline stage,
   :dbcommand:`serverStatus` reports the number of times that stage
   has been executed.

   *Updated in version 5.2 (and 5.0.6).*

.. _server-status-apiVersions:

.. serverstatus:: metrics.apiVersions

   A document that contains:
   
   - The name of each client application
   - The Stable API version that each application was configured with within
     the last 24-hour period
     
   Consider the following when viewing ``metrics.apiVersions``:

   - The possible returned values for each ``appname`` are:
     
     - ``default``: The command was issued without a Stable API version specified.
     - ``1``: The command was issued with Stable API version 1.
     
     .. note::
        
        You may see both return values for an ``appname`` because you can
        specify a Stable API version at the command level. Some of your
        commands may have been issued with no Stable API version, while
        others were issued with version 1.

   - API version metrics are retained for 24 hours. If
     no commands are issued with a specific API version from an 
     application in the past 24 hours, that ``appname`` and API version 
     will be removed from the metrics. This also applies to the 
     ``default`` API version metric.

   - Set the ``appname`` when connecting to a MongoDB instance by 
     specifying the ``appname`` in the connection URI. ``?appName=ZZZ`` 
     sets the ``appname`` to ``ZZZZ``.

   - Drivers accessing the Stable API can set a default ``appname``.

   - If no ``appname`` is configured, a default value will be 
     automatically populated based on the product. For example, for a 
     :compass:`MongoDB Compass </>` connection with no ``appname`` in 
     the URI, the metric returns: ``'MongoDB Compass': [ 'default' ]``.

   *New in version 5.0.* 

.. serverstatus:: metrics.operatorCounters

   A document that reports on the use of :ref:`aggregation pipeline
   <aggregation-pipeline>` operators and expressions.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.operatorCounters.expressions

   A document with a number that indicates how often
   :ref:`aggregation-expression-operators` ran.

   To get metrics for a specific operator, such as the greater-than
   operator (:expression:`$gt`), append the operator to the command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1 } ).metrics.operatorCounters.expressions.$gt

   .. versionadded:: 5.0

.. serverstatus:: metrics.operatorCounters.match

   A document with a number that indicates how often
   :ref:`match expressions <query-projection-operators-top>` ran.

   :ref:`Match expression operators <query-projection-operators-top>`
   also increment as part of an aggregation pipeline :pipeline:`$match`
   stage. If the ``$match`` stage uses the :query:`$expr` operator, the
   counter for ``$expr`` increments, but the component counters do not
   increment. 

   Consider the following query: 

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.matchCount.aggregate(
         [
            { $match:
               {  $expr: { $gt: [ "$_id", 0 ] } }
            }
         ]
      )

   The counter for ``$expr`` increments when the query runs. The
   counter for ``$gt`` does not. 

.. serverstatus:: metrics.changeStreams.largeEventsSplit

   The number of change stream events larger than 16 MB that were split
   into smaller fragments. Events are only split if you use the
   :pipeline:`$changeStreamSplitLargeEvent` pipeline stage.

   .. versionadded:: 7.0 (*Also available in 6.0.9*)

.. serverstatus:: metrics.changeStreams

   A document that reports information about :ref:`change stream
   <changeStreams>` events larger than 16 MB.

   .. versionadded:: 7.0

.. serverstatus:: metrics.changeStreams.largeEventsFailed

   The number of change stream events that caused a
   ``BSONObjectTooLarge`` exception because the event was larger than 16
   MB. To prevent the exception, see
   :pipeline:`$changeStreamSplitLargeEvent`.

   .. versionadded:: 7.0 (*Also available in 6.0.9 and 5.0.19*)

.. serverstatus:: metrics.changeStreams.showExpandedEvents

   The number of change stream cursors with the :ref:`showExpandedEvents 
   <change-streams-expanded-events>` option set to ``true``.

   The counter for ``showExpandedEvents`` increments when you: 
   
   - Open a change stream cursor.
   
   - Run the :dbcommand:`explain` command on a change stream cursor.

   .. versionadded:: 7.1

.. serverstatus:: metrics.commands

   A document that reports on the use of database commands. The fields
   in :serverstatus:`metrics.commands` are the names of :doc:`database
   commands </reference/command>`. For each command, the
   :dbcommand:`serverStatus` reports the total number of executions and
   the number of failed executions.

   :serverstatus:`metrics.commands` includes
   ``replSetStepDownWithForce`` (i.e. the :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown`
   command with ``force: true``) as well as the overall
   ``replSetStepDown``. In earlier versions, the command
   reported only overall ``replSetStepDown`` metrics.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.commands.<command>.failed

   The number of times ``<command>`` failed on this
   :binary:`~bin.mongod`.


.. serverstatus:: metrics.commands.<create or collMod>.validator

   For the :dbcommand:`create` and :dbcommand:`collMod` commands, a document
   that reports on non-empty ``validator`` objects passed to the command to
   specify :ref:`validation rules or expressions <schema-validation-overview>`
   for the collection.


.. serverstatus:: metrics.commands.<create or collMod>.validator.total

   The number of times a non-empty ``validator`` object was passed as an option
   to the command on this :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.commands.<create or collMod>.validator.failed

   The number of times a call to the command on this :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   failed with a non-empty ``validator`` object due to a schema validation
   error.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.commands.<create or collMod>.validator.jsonSchema

   The number of times a ``validator`` object with a ``$jsonSchema`` was passed
   as an option to the command on this :binary:`~bin.mongod`.


.. serverstatus:: metrics.commands.<command>.total

   The number of times ``<command>`` executed on this
   :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.commands.<command>.rejected

   The number of times ``<command>`` was rejected on this
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` because the command or operation has an
   associated query setting where the ``reject`` field is ``true``.

   To set the ``reject`` field, use ``setQuerySettings``.

   .. versionadded:: 8.0

.. serverstatus:: metrics.commands.update.pipeline

   The number of times an
   :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>`
   was used to update documents on this :binary:`~bin.mongod`. Subtract
   this value from the total number of updates to get the number of
   updates made with :ref:`document <update-operators-top-level>`
   syntax.

   The ``pipeline`` counter is only available for ``update`` and
   ``findAndModify`` operations.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.commands.findAndModify.pipeline

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.buffer

   MongoDB buffers oplog operations from the replication sync source
   buffer before applying oplog entries in a
   batch. :serverstatus:`metrics.repl.buffer` provides a way to
   track oplog buffers. See
   :ref:`replica-set-internals-multi-threaded-replication` for more
   information on the oplog application process.

   .. versionchanged:: 8.0

   Starting in MongoDB 8.0, secondaries now update the local oplog and apply
   changes to the database in parallel. For each batch of oplog entries, MongoDB
   uses two buffers:

   - The :serverstatus:`write <metrics.repl.buffer.write>` buffer receives
     new oplog entries from the primary. The writer adds these entries to the
     local oplog and sends them to the applier.

   - The :serverstatus:`apply <metrics.repl.buffer.apply>` buffer receives new
     oplog entries from the writer. The applier uses these entries to update
     the local database.

   This is a breaking change as it deprecates the older ``metrics.repl.buffer``
   status metrics.

   :serverstatus:`apply.count <metrics.repl.buffer.apply.count>` or
   :serverstatus:`write.count <metrics.repl.buffer.write.count>` status metrics.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.buffer.maxSizeBytes

   :serverstatus:`metrics.repl.network.getmores.totalMillis`
   reports the total amount of time required to collect data from
   ``getmore`` operations.

   .. note::

      This number can be quite large, as MongoDB will wait for more
      data even if the ``getmore`` operation does not initial return
      data.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.network.getmores.numEmptyBatches

   The number of empty ``oplog`` batches a secondary receives from its
   sync source. A secondary receives an empty batch if it is fully
   synced with its source and either:

   - The ``getmore`` times out waiting for more data, or

   - The sync source's majority commit point has advanced since the
     last batch sent to this secondary.

   For a primary, if the instance was previously a secondary, the
   number reports on the empty batches received when it was a
   secondary. Otherwise, for a primary, this number is ``0``.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.network.notPrimaryLegacyUnacknowledgedWrites

   The number of unacknowledged (``w: 0``) legacy write operations (see

   number of operations read from the replication source.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.network.readersCreated

   The total number of oplog query processes created. MongoDB will
   create a new oplog query any time an error occurs in the

   increment every time MongoDB selects a new source for replication.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.network.replSetUpdatePosition

   A document that reports the number of ``replSetUpdatePosition``
   commands a node sent to its sync source.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.network.replSetUpdatePosition.num

   The number of ``replSetUpdatePosition`` commands a node sent
   to its sync source. ``replSetUpdatePosition`` commands are internal
   replication commands that communicate replication progress from
   nodes to their sync sources.

   .. note::

      Replica set members in the :replstate:`STARTUP2` state do not send
      the ``replSetUpdatePosition`` command to their sync source.

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.reconfig

   A document containing the number of times that member ``newlyAdded``
   fields were automatically removed by the primary. When a member is

.. serverstatus:: metrics.repl.reconfig.numAutoReconfigsForRemovalOfNewlyAddedFields

   The number of times that ``newlyAdded`` member fields were
   automatically removed by the primary. When a member is first added to
   the replica set, the member's ``newlyAdded`` field is set to
   ``true``. After the primary receives the member's heartbeat response
   indicating the member state is :replstate:`SECONDARY`,
   :replstate:`RECOVERING`, or :replstate:`ROLLBACK`, the primary
   automatically removes the member's ``newlyAdded`` field. The
   ``newlyAdded`` fields are stored in the :data:`local.system.replset`
   collection.

   opLatencies : {
      reads : <document>,
      writes : <document>,
      commands : <document>,
      transactions : <document>
   },

.. serverstatus:: opLatencies

   A document containing operation latencies for the instance as a whole.
   See :ref:`latency-stats-document` for a description of this document.

   Starting in MongoDB 6.2, the :serverstatus:`~opLatencies` metric 
   reports for both :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` 
   instances. Latencies reported by ``mongos`` include operation latency
   time and communication time between the ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` 
   instances.

   To include the histogram in the ``opLatencies`` output, run the following 
   command: 

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, opLatencies: { histograms: true } } ).opLatencies


.. serverstatus:: opLatencies.reads

   Latency statistics for read requests.

.. serverstatus:: opLatencies.writes

   }

.. serverstatus:: opWorkingTime

   Document that includes information on operation execution for the instance. 
   See :ref:`latency-stats-document` for a description of this document.

   The fields under ``opWorkingTime`` are measured in ``workingMillis``, which 
   is the amount of time that MongoDB spends working on that operation. This 
   means that factors such as waiting for locks and flow control don't affect 
   ``opWorkingTime``. 

   To include the histogram in the ``opWorkingTime`` output, run the following 
   command: 

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { serverStatus: 1, opWorkingTime: { histogram: true } } ).opWorkingTime

   More specifically, the :serverstatus:`opWriteConcernCounters`
   reports on the :ref:`w: \<value\> <wc-w>` specified by the write
   operations. The journal flag option (``j``) and the timeout option
   (``wtimeout``) of the write concerns does not affect the count. The
   count is incremented even if the operation times out.

      command : Long("<num>"), 
   },

.. serverstatus:: opcounters

   A document that reports on database operations by type since the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance last started.

   These numbers will grow over time until next restart. Analyze these
   values over time to track database utilization.

   .. note::

      The data in :serverstatus:`opcounters` treats operations
      that affect multiple documents, such as bulk insert or
      multi-update operations, as a single operation. See
      :serverstatus:`metrics.document` for more granular
      document-level operation tracking.

      Additionally, these values reflect received operations, and
      increment even when operations are not successful.

.. serverstatus:: opcounters.insert

   The total number of insert operations received since the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance last started.

.. serverstatus:: opcounters.query

   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance last started.

.. serverstatus:: opcounters.delete

   The total number of delete operations since the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instance last started.

.. serverstatus:: opcounters.getmore

   The total number of :dbcommand:`getMore` operations since the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance last started. This counter can be high
   even if the query count is low. Secondary nodes send
   :dbcommand:`getMore` operations as part of the replication process.

.. serverstatus:: opcounters.command

   The total number of commands issued to the database since the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance last started.

   :serverstatus:`opcounters.command` counts all :ref:`commands
   <database-commands>` **except** the following:
   
   - :dbcommand:`insert`
   - :dbcommand:`update`
   - :dbcommand:`delete`
   - :dbcommand:`aggregate`

.. serverstatus:: opcounters.deprecated

   ``opQuery`` counts the number of requests for opcodes that are
   deprecated in MongoDB 5.0 but are temporarily supported. This section
   only appears in the ``db.serverStatus()`` output when a deprecated
   opcode has been used. 

   The counter is reset when ``mongod`` starts.

   These values will differ from the :serverstatus:`opcounters` values
   because of how MongoDB serializes operations during replication.
   See :doc:`/replication` for more information on replication.

   These numbers will grow over time in response to database use until

   Available in the :doc:`/core/wiredtiger`.

.. serverstatus:: oplogTruncation.oplogMinRetentionHours

   The minimum retention period for the oplog in hours. If the oplog
   has exceeded the oplog size, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` only
   truncates oplog entries older than the configured retention
   value.

   Only visible if the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is a member of a replica
   set *and*:

   - The :binary:`~bin.mongod` was started with the
     :option:`--oplogMinRetentionHours
     <mongod --oplogMinRetentionHours>` command line option *or* the

   .. versionadded:: 5.0

.. serverstatus:: repl.primaryOnlyServices.RenameCollectionParticipantService

   Document that contains the state and number of instances of the
   ``RenameCollectionParticipantService``.

   The ``RenameCollectionParticipantService`` ensures that, after a shard

   :term:`Rollback <rollback>` identifier. Used to determine if a rollback has
   happened for this :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

.. serverstatus:: repl.replicationProgress

   An array with one document for each member of the replica set that
   reports replication process to this member. Typically this is the
   primary, or secondaries if using chained replication.

   To include this output, you must pass the ``repl`` option to the
   :dbcommand:`serverStatus`, as in the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.serverStatus({ "repl": 1 })
      db.runCommand({ "serverStatus": 1, "repl": 1 })

   The content of the :serverstatus:`repl.replicationProgress` section
   depends on the source of each member's replication. This section
   supports internal operation and is for internal and diagnostic use only.

.. serverstatus:: repl.replicationProgress[n].rid

   An ObjectId used as an ID for the members of the replica
   set. For internal use only.

.. serverstatus:: repl.replicationProgress[n].optime

   Information regarding the last operation from the :term:`oplog` that
   the member applied, as reported from this member.

.. serverstatus:: repl.replicationProgress[n].host

   The name of the host in ``[hostname]:[port]`` format for the member
   of the replica set.

      :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance. The
      values in the document distinguish standard authentication and
      speculative authentication. [#speculative-auth]_

      .. note::

         The fields in the ``mechanisms`` document depend on the
         configuration of the :parameter:`authenticationMechanisms`
         parameter. The ``mechanisms`` document includes a field for
         each authentication mechanism supported by your
         :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

         The following example shows the shape of the ``mechanisms``
         document for a deployment that only supports :doc:`x.509
         </core/security-x.509/>` authentication.

   .. serverstatus:: security.authentication.mechanisms.MONGODB-X509

      A document that reports on the number of times
      :ref:`x.509 <security-auth-x509>` has been used to
      authenticate against the
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

      Includes total number of ``x.509`` authentication attempts and the
      subset of those attempts which were speculative.
      [#speculative-auth]_

   .. serverstatus:: security.authentication.mechanisms.MONGODB-X509.speculativeAuthenticate.received

      Number of speculative authentication attempts received using
      :ref:`x.509 <security-auth-x509>`. Includes both successful and
      failed speculative authentication attempts. [#speculative-auth]_

   .. serverstatus:: security.authentication.mechanisms.MONGODB-X509.speculativeAuthenticate.successful

      Number of successful speculative authentication attempts received
      using x.509. [#speculative-auth]_

   .. serverstatus:: security.authentication.mechanisms.MONGODB-X509.authenticate.received

      Number of successful and failed authentication attempts
      received using x.509.  This value includes speculative 
      authentication attempts received using x.509.

   .. serverstatus:: security.authentication.mechanisms.MONGODB-X509.authenticate.successful

      Number of successful authentication attempts received using
      x.508. This value includes successful speculative authentication 
      attempts which used x.509.

   .. [#speculative-auth]

      Speculative authentication minimizes the number of network round
      trips during the authentication process to optimize performance.

   .. serverstatus:: security.SSLServerSubjectName

      The subject name associated with the
      :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` instance's TLS/SSL
      certificate.

   .. serverstatus:: security.SSLServerHasCertificateAuthority

      A boolean that is:

      - ``true`` when the :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos`
        instance's TLS/SSL certificate is associated with a certificate
        authority.

      - ``false`` when the TLS/SSL certificate is self-signed.

   .. serverstatus:: security.SSLServerCertificateExpirationDate

      The expiration date and time of the
      :binary:`mongod` / :binary:`mongos` instance's TLS/SSL
      certificate.

   for a :binary:`~bin.mongos` or a shard member, not for a config
   server.

.. serverstatus:: sharding.configsvrConnectionString

   The connection string for the config servers.

.. serverstatus:: sharding.lastSeenConfigServerOpTime

   The latest optime of the CSRS primary that the :program:`mongos` or
   the shard member has seen. The optime document includes:

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics

   A document which contains metrics on metadata refresh on sharded
   clusters.

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.countStaleConfigErrors

   The total number of times that threads hit stale config exception.

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.countDonorMoveChunkStarted

   The total number of times that MongoDB starts the
   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command or :dbcommand:`moveRange` command on
   the primary node of the shard as part of the :ref:`range migration
   procedure <range-migration-procedure>`. This increasing number does not
   consider whether the chunk migrations succeed or not.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.countDonorMoveChunkCommitted

   .. include:: /includes/chunk-migrations-version-list.rst

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.totalDonorMoveChunkTimeMillis

   Cumulative time in milliseconds to move chunks from the current shard
   to another shard. For each chunk migration, the time starts when a
   :dbcommand:`moveRange` or :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command starts, and
   ends when the chunk is moved to another shard in a :ref:`range
   migration procedure <range-migration-procedure>`.

   *Only available on a shard.*

   .. include:: /includes/chunk-migrations-version-list.rst

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.totalDonorChunkCloneTimeMillis

   The cumulative time, in milliseconds, that the :ref:`clone phase of
   the range migration procedure <range-migration-procedure>` takes on
   the primary node of the shard.  Specifically, for each migration on
   this shard, the tracked time starts with the :dbcommand:`moveRange`
   and :dbcommand:`moveChunk` commands and ends before the destination
   shard enters a ``catchup`` phase to apply changes that occurred
   during the :ref:`range migration procedure <range-migration-procedure>`.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.totalCriticalSectionCommitTimeMillis

   The cumulative time, in milliseconds, that the :ref:`update metadata
   phase of the range migrations procedure <range-migration-procedure>`
   takes on the primary node of the shard. During the update metadata
   phase, MongoDB blocks all operations on the collection.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.totalCriticalSectionTimeMillis

   The cumulative time, in milliseconds, that the :ref:`catch-up
   phase and the update metadata phase of the range migration procedure
   <range-migration-procedure>` takes on the primary node of the shard. 

   To calculate the duration of the catch-up phase, subtract
   :serverstatus:`~shardingStatistics.totalCriticalSectionCommitTimeMillis` from

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.countRecipientMoveChunkStarted

   Cumulative, always-increasing count of chunks this member, acting as
   the primary of the recipient shard, has started to receive (whether
   the move has succeeded or not).

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.countDocsDeletedByRangeDeleter

   The cumulative, always-increasing count of documents that MongoDB
   deletes on the primary node of the donor shard during chunk
   migration. 

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

   .. versionchanged:: 7.1

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.countDonorMoveChunkLockTimeout

   The cumulative, always-increasing count of chunk migrations that MongoDB
   aborts on the primary node of the donor shard due to lock acquisition
   timeouts.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.unfinishedMigrationFromPreviousPrimary

   The number of unfinished migrations left by the previous
   primary after an election. This value is only updated after
   the newly-elected :binary:`~bin.mongod` completes the transition to
   primary.

   *Only present when run on a shard.*

.. serverstatus:: shardingStatistics.chunkMigrationConcurrency

   The number of threads on the source shard and the receiving shard for

   .. include:: /includes/fact-tcmalloc-upgrade-note.rst

   A document that contains information on memory allocation for the server.
   By default, ``tcmalloc`` metrics are included in the ``serverStatus`` output. 
   To change the verbosity of the ``tcmalloc`` section, specify an integer 
   between ``0`` and ``3`` (inclusive):

   - If you set verbosity to ``0``, ``tcmalloc`` metrics aren't included in the 
     ``serverStatus`` output.
   - If you set verbosity to ``1``, the ``serverStatus`` output includes the 
     default ``tcmalloc`` metrics.
   - If you set verbosity to ``2``, the ``serverStatus`` output includes default 
     ``tcmalloc`` metrics and the :serverstatus:`tcmalloc.tcmalloc.cpuCache` 
     section.
   - If you set verbosity to ``3``, the ``serverStatus`` output includes all 
     ``tcmalloc`` metrics.
   
   If you specify a value higher than ``3``, MongoDB sets the ``verbosity`` 
   to ``3``.
   
   For example, to call ``serverStatus`` with ``verbosity`` set to ``2``, run 
   the following command:

.. serverstatus:: transactions
   
   When run on a :binary:`~bin.mongod`, a document with data about the
   :ref:`retryable wrties <retryable-writes>` and
   :ref:`transactions <transactions>`.

   When run on a :binary:`~bin.mongos`, a document with data about the
   :ref:`transactions <transactions>` run on the instance.

.. serverstatus:: transactions.retriedCommandsCount

   |mongod-only|

   The total number of retry attempts that have been received after the
   corresponding retryable write command has already been committed.
   That is, a retryable write is attempted even though the write has
   previously succeeded and has an associated record for the
   transaction and session in the :data:`config.transactions`
   collection, such as when the initial write response to the client is
   lost.

   .. note::

      MongoDB does not re-execute the committed writes.

   The total is across all sessions.

   The total does not include any retryable writes that may happen
   internally as part of a chunk migration.

.. serverstatus:: transactions.retriedStatementsCount

   |mongod-only|

   The total number of write statements associated with the retried
   commands in :serverstatus:`transactions.retriedCommandsCount`.

   .. note::

      MongoDB does not re-execute the committed writes.

   The total does not include any retryable writes that may happen
   internally as part of a chunk migration.

.. serverstatus:: transactions.transactionsCollectionWriteCount

   |mongod-only|

   The total number of writes to the :data:`config.transactions`
   collection, triggered when a new retryable write statement is
   committed.

   For update and delete commands, since only single document
   operations are retryable, there is one write per statement.

   For insert operations, there is one write per batch of documents
   inserted, except when a failure leads to each document being
   inserted separately.

   The total includes writes to a server's :data:`config.transactions`
   collection that occur as part of a migration.

.. serverstatus:: transactions.currentActive

   |both|

   The total number of open transactions currently executing a command.

.. serverstatus:: transactions.currentInactive

   |both|


   The total number of open transactions that are not currently
   executing a command.

.. serverstatus:: transactions.currentOpen

   |both|

   The total number of open transactions. A transaction is opened when
   the first command is run as a part of that transaction, and stays
   open until the transaction either commits or aborts.

   aborted on this instance since its last startup.

   For the :binary:`~bin.mongos`, the total number of transactions
   aborted through this instance since its last startup.

.. serverstatus:: transactions.totalCommitted

   For the :binary:`~bin.mongod`, the total number of transactions
   committed on the instance since its last startup.

   started on this instance since its last startup.

.. serverstatus:: transactions.abortCause

   |mongos-only|

   Breakdown of the :serverstatus:`transactions.totalAborted` by cause.
   If a client issues an explicit ``abortTransaction``, the cause is
   listed as ``abort``.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      totalAborted : Long("5"),
      abortCause : {
         abort : Long("1"),
         DuplicateKey : Long("1"),
         StaleConfig : Long("3"),
         SnapshotTooOld : Long("1")
      },

.. serverstatus:: transactions.totalContactedParticipants

   |mongos-only|

   The total number of shards contacted for all transactions started
   through this :binary:`~bin.mongos` since its last startup.

         successful : Long("0"),
         successfulDurationMicros : Long("0")
      },
      singleShard : {
         initiated : Long("5"),
         successful : Long("5"),
         successfulDurationMicros : Long("203118")
      },
      singleWriteShard : {
         initiated : Long("0"),
         successful : Long("0"),
         successfulDurationMicros : Long("0")
      },
      readOnly : {
         initiated : Long("0"),
         successful : Long("0"),
         successfulDurationMicros : Long("0")
      },
      twoPhaseCommit : {
         initiated : Long("1"),
         successful : Long("1"),
         successfulDurationMicros : Long("179616")
      },
      recoverWithToken : {
         initiated : Long("0"),
         successful : Long("0"),
         successfulDurationMicros : Long("0")
      }

   The types of commit are:

.. note::

   The following is not an exhaustive list.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.uri

   A string. For internal use by MongoDB.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.async

   A document that returns statistics related to the asynchronous
   operations API. This is unused by MongoDB.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.block-manager

   A document that returns statistics on the block manager operations.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache

   A document that returns statistics on the cache and page evictions
   from the cache.

   The following describes some of the key
   :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache` statistics:

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.maximum bytes configured

      Maximum cache size.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.bytes currently in the cache

      Size in bytes of the data currently in cache. This value should
      not be greater than the ``maximum bytes configured`` value.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.unmodified pages evicted

      Main statistics for page eviction.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.tracked dirty bytes in the cache

      Size in bytes of the dirty data in the cache. This value should
      be less than the ``bytes currently in the cache`` value.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.pages read into cache

      Number of pages read into the cache.
      :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache.pages read into cache` with
      the :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache.pages written from
      cache` can provide an overview of the I/O activity.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cache.pages written from cache

      Number of pages written from the cache.
      :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache.pages written from cache`
      with the :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache.pages read into
      cache` can provide an overview of the I/O activity.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/wt-cache-setting.rst

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.connection

   A document that returns statistics related to WiredTiger connections.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.cursor

   A document that returns statistics on WiredTiger cursor.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.data-handle

   A document that returns statistics on the data handles and sweeps.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.log

   A document that returns statistics on WiredTiger's write ahead log
   (i.e. the journal).

   .. seealso::

      :ref:`journaling-wiredTiger`

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.reconciliation

   A document that returns statistics on the reconciliation process.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.session

   A document that returns the open cursor count and open session count
   for the session.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.thread-yield

   A document that returns statistics on yields during page
   acquisitions.

.. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.transaction

   A document that returns statistics on transaction checkpoints and
   operations.

   .. serverstatus:: wiredTiger.transaction.transaction checkpoint most recent time (msecs)

      Amount of time, in milliseconds, to create the most recent
      checkpoint. An increase in this value under stead write load may
      indicate saturation on the I/O subsystem.
