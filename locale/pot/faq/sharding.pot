msgid ":program:`mongod` issues this message if, during a :ref:`chunk migration <sharding-chunk-migration>`, the :term:`shard` could not connect to the :term:`config database` to update chunk information at the end of the migration process. If the shard cannot update the config database after :dbcommand:`moveChunk`, the cluster will have an inconsistent view of all chunks. In these situations, the :term:`primary` member of the shard will terminate itself to prevent data inconsistency. If the :term:`secondary` member can access the config database, the shard's data will be accessible after an election. Administrators will need to resolve the chunk migration failure independently."
