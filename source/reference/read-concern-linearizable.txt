Read Concern ``"linearizable"``
===============================

.. versionadded:: 3.4

The query returns data that reflects all successful
majority-acknowledged writes that completed prior to the start of the
read operation. The query may wait for concurrently executing writes to
propagate to a majority of replica set members before returning results.

If a majority of your replica set members crash and restart after the
read operation, documents returned by the read operation are durable if
:rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` is set to the default
state of ``true``.

You can specify linearizable read concern for read operations on
the :replstate:`primary <PRIMARY>` only.

Linearizable read concern guarantees only apply if read
operations specify a query filter that uniquely identifies a
single document.

.. tip::

   Always use ``maxTimeMS`` with linearizable read concern in case a
   majority of data bearing members are unavailable. ``maxTimeMS``
   ensures that the operation does not block indefinitely and instead
   ensures that the operation returns an error if the read concern
   cannot be fulfilled.

Causally Consistent Sessions
----------------------------

Read concern :readconcern:`linearizable` is unavailable for use with
causally consistent sessions.

Real Time Order
---------------

Combined with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern,
:readconcern:`"linearizable"` read concern enables multiple threads to
perform reads and writes on a single document as if a single thread
performed these operations in real time; that is, the corresponding
schedule for these reads and writes is considered linearizable.

Read Your Own Writes

Performance Comparisons
-----------------------

Unlike :readconcern:`"majority"`, :readconcern:`"linearizable"` read
concern confirms with secondary members that the read operation is
reading from a primary that is capable of confirming writes with
:writeconcern:`{ w: "majority" } <"majority">` write concern.
[#edge-cases-2-primaries]_ As such, reads with linearizable read
concern may be significantly slower than reads with
:readconcern:`"majority"` or :readconcern:`"local"` read concerns.

Always use ``maxTimeMS`` with linearizable read concern in case a
majority of data bearing members are unavailable. ``maxTimeMS`` ensures
that the operation does not block indefinitely and instead ensures that
the operation returns an error if the read concern cannot be fulfilled.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.find( { _id: 5 } ).readConcern("linearizable").maxTimeMS(10000)

   db.runCommand( {
        find: "restaurants",
        filter: { _id: 5 },
        readConcern: { level: "linearizable" },
        maxTimeMS: 10000
   } )
