Jira
~~~~

10gen prefers `jira.mongodb.org <https://jira.mongodb.org>`_ for all
communication regarding MongoDB and related products.

Submit a ticket in the :issue:`Core Server Security <SECURITY>`"
project, at: <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SECURITY/>. The ticket
number will become reference identification for the issue for the
lifetime of the issue, and you can use this identifier for tracking
purposes.

10gen will respond to any vulnerability notification received in a
Jira case posted to the :issue:`SECURITY` project.

Email
~~~~~

While Jira is the preferred communication vector, you may also report
vulnerabilities via email to <security@10gen.com>.

You may encrypt email using our `public key
<http://docs.mongodb.org/10gen-gpg-key.asc>`_, to ensure the privacy
of any sensitive information in your vulnerability report.

10gen will respond to any vulnerability notification received via
email with email which will contain a reference number (i.e. a ticket
from the :issue:`SECURITY` project,) Jira case posted to the :issue:`SECURITY`
project.

Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~

10gen will validate all submitted vulnerabilities. 10gen will use Jira
to track all communications regarding the vulnerability, which may
include requests for clarification and for additional information. If
needed 10gen representatives can set up a conference call to exchange
information regarding the vulnerability.

Disclosure
~~~~~~~~~~

10gen requests that you do *not* publicly disclose any information
regarding the vulnerability or exploit the issue until 10gen has had the
opportunity to analyze the vulnerability, respond to the notification,
and to notify key users, customers, and partners if needed.

The amount of time required to validate a reported vulnerability
depends on the complexity and severity of the issue. 10gen takes all
required vulnerabilities very seriously and will always ensure that
there is a clear and open channel of communication with the reporter
of the vulnerability.

After validating the issue, 10gen will coordinate public disclosure of
the issue with the reporter in a mutually agreed timeframe and
format. If required or requested, the reporter of a vulnerability will
receive credit in the published security bulletin.
