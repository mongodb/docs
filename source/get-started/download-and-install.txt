   .. step:: Install Dependencies

      Ensure you have the following dependencies installed
      in your development environment:
      
      - `Python3 version 3.7 or later <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
      - `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`__
      - `dnspython <https://pypi.org/project/dnspython/>`__

   .. step:: Create a Project Directory

      In your shell, run the following command to create a 
      directory called ``pymongo-quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir pymongo-quickstart

      Run the following command to navigate into the project 
      directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd pymongo-quickstart

      Run the following command to create a file to contain your application:

      .. code-block:: bash

         touch quickstart.py

   .. step:: Install {+driver-short+}

      Run the following commands in your shell to create and activate a virtual
      environment in which to install the driver:

      .. code-block:: bash

         python3 -m venv venv
         source venv/bin/activate
      
      With the virtual environment activated, run the following command to
      install the current version of {+driver-short+}:
      
      .. code-block:: bash

         python3 -m pip install pymongo

After you complete these steps, you have a new project directory
and the driver dependencies installed.
