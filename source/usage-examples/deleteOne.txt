=================
Delete a Document
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can delete a document in a collection using the ``DeleteOne()``
method. 

The following example specifies a query filter to the ``DeleteOne()``
method, which matches documents in the ``movies`` collection where the
``title`` field is "Twilight", and deletes the first document that
matches. 

.. include:: /includes/usage-examples/run-example-tip.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/deleteOne.go
   :start-after: begin deleteOne
   :end-before: end deleteOne
   :emphasize-lines: 4
   :language: go
   :dedent:

Expected Result
---------------

After running the preceding code snippet, you should not be able to find
the following document in the ``movies`` collection:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   // result truncated
   { "_id": ObjectId("573a13bff29313caabd5e06b"), ..., "title": "Twilight", ... }
