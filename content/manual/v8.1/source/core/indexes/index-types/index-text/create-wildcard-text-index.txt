You can create a text index that contains every document field with
string data in a collection. These text indexes are called **wildcard
text indexes**. Wildcard text indexes support :ref:`text search
<text-search>` on unknown, arbitrary, or dynamically generated fields.

To create a wildcard text index, set the index key to the wildcard
specifier (``$**``) and set the index value to ``text``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.<collection>.createIndex( { "$**": "text" } )

About this Task
---------------

Wildcard text indexes are distinct from :ref:`wildcard indexes
<wildcard-index-core>`. Wildcard text indexes support queries that use
the :query:`$text` operator, while wildcard indexes do not.

After you create a wildcard text index, when you insert or update
documents, the index updates to include any new string field values. As
a result, wildcard text indexes negatively impact performance for
inserts and updates.

Only use wildcard text indexes when the fields you want to index are
unknown or may change. Wildcard text indexes don't perform as well as
targeted text indexes on specific fields. If your collection contains
arbitrary field names that prevent targeted indexes, consider remodeling
your schema to have consistent field names. To learn more about targeted
indexes, see :ref:`create-indexes-to-support-queries`.

Before You Begin
----------------

.. include:: /includes/indexes/text-search-blog-example-documents.rst

Procedure
---------

Create a wildcard text index on the ``blog`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.blog.createIndex( { "$**": "text" } )

Results
-------

The wildcard text index supports text search queries on all fields in the
collection. Consider the following queries:

Search for a Single Word
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Query the ``blog`` collection for the string ``coffee``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.blog.find( { $text: { $search: "coffee" } } )

Output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
     {
       _id: 1,
       content: 'This morning I had a cup of coffee.',
       about: 'beverage',
       keywords: [ 'coffee' ]
     },
     {
       _id: 3,
       content: 'My favorite flavors are strawberry and coffee',
       about: 'ice cream',
       keywords: [ 'food', 'dessert' ]
     }
   ]

The preceding query returns all documents that contain the string
``coffee`` in any field.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Query the ``blog`` collection for documents that contain the string
``poll`` **or** ``coffee``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.blog.find( { $text: { $search: "poll coffee" } } )

Output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
     {
       _id: 1,
       content: 'This morning I had a cup of coffee.',
       about: 'beverage',
       keywords: [ 'coffee' ]
     },
     {
       _id: 3,
       content: 'My favorite flavors are strawberry and coffee',
       about: 'ice cream',
       keywords: [ 'food', 'dessert' ]
     },
     {
       _id: 2,
       content: 'Who likes chocolate ice cream for dessert?',
       about: 'food',
       keywords: [ 'poll' ]
     }
   ]
   

The preceding query returns documents that contain the string ``poll``
or ``coffee`` in any field.

Search for an Exact String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Query the ``blog`` collection for documents that contain the exact
string ``chocolate ice cream``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.blog.find( { $text: { $search: "\"chocolate ice cream\"" } } )

Output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false 

   [
     {
       _id: 2,
       content: 'Who likes chocolate ice cream for dessert?',
       about: 'food',
       keywords: [ 'poll' ]
     }
   ]

The preceding query returns documents that contain the exact string
``chocolate ice cream`` in any field.
