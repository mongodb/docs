To interact with Relational Migrator, you use a project. A project holds
configuration settings, mapping rules, and migration-specific details.
Relational Migrator allows you to :ref:`import<import-project>`, 
:ref:`export <export-project>`, and :ref:`delete <delete-project>` projects.
You can also :ref:`manage the relational model<rm-manage-relational-model>`
from a project.

Get Started
-----------

There are multiple options for you to create a project:

     - Description

   * - :ref:`rm-create-project-live`
     - Provide source and destination connection details and migrate data from a live relational system.
   * - :ref:`create-project-schema-file`
     - Export a Data Definition Language (DDL) file from your relational system and import it into Relational Migrator.
   * - :ref:`create-project-sample-schema`
     - Use a predefined sample schema even if you do not have a relational system to connect to.
