Your schema is the architecture of your cluster, including your
:term:`collections <collection>`, :term:`indexes <index>` and
:term:`documents <document>`. |mms| offers two ways to detect common
schema design issues and suggests modifications that follow MongoDB’s
best practices:

- The :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` provides
  holistic schema recommendations for your cluster by sampling documents
  in your most active collections and collections with slow-running
  queries.

- The :ref:`Data Explorer <data-explorer-db-colls>` offers schema
  suggestions for a specific collection by sampling documents in that
  collection.

Schema Suggestions
------------------

To learn more about how to apply the suggestions offered in either the
Performance Advisor or Data Explorer, refer to the following pages:

   * - Schema Improvement
     - Reason for Suggestion

   * - :ref:`embedded-documents-arrays-anti-pattern`
     - Your documents do not contain embedded documents, arrays, or 
       both. Take advantage of MongoDB's rich schema model to embed 
       related data.

   * - :ref:`unbounded-arrays-anti-pattern`
     - Your documents contain array fields with many elements,
       which can degrade query performance.

   * - :ref:`indexes-anti-pattern`
     - You have unnecessary indexes in your collection, which can 
       consume disk space and degrade write performance.

   * - :ref:`reduce-document-size-anti-pattern`
     - You have excessively large documents, which can degrade 
       the performance of your most frequent queries.

   * - :ref:`too-many-namespaces-anti-pattern`
     - You have an exceedingly high number of collections in a
       database, which can result in unnecessary disk space usage.

   * - :ref:`case-insensitive-regex-anti-pattern`
     - You are executing case-insensitive regex queries which could be
       improved with an index.

Limitations of Schema Suggestions
---------------------------------

- Schema suggestions for a collection are partly driven by a random
  sampling of documents from that collection. Because this sampling is
  performed each time your schema is analyzed, you may see different
  suggestions at different times for the same collection.

- The :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` uses slow query
  logs as an input to recognize certain schema issues, namely too many
  :pipeline:`$lookup` operations and not utilizing an index for
  case-sensitive regex queries. If a collection does not have any
  operations that last longer than 100 milliseconds, the Performance
  Advisor may not suggest all potential improvements for that
  collection, or may not show all reasons why an improvement is being
  suggested.

- The :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` analyzes
  the 20 most active collections based on the output of the
  :dbcommand:`top` command. To see suggestions for a specific
  collection, view that collection in the
  :ref:`Data Explorer <data-explorer-db-colls>`.
