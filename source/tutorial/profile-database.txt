A :manual:`database profiler </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>`
gathers statistics about writes, cursors, and commands on one running
|mongod| instance.

|mms| can collect and display statistics from any of your |mongod|
instances that have profiling enabled. |mms| displays this data in the
:guilabel:`Profiler` section of an instance's :guilabel:`Metrics` page.
To access an instance's metrics, click the :guilabel:`Metrics` button
for that instance.

The :guilabel:`Profiler` displays one aspect, like *Operation Execution
Time*, that could slow database operations over a set time frame. It
displays this data in both a chart and a table that each can filter on
aspect and time frame. The Profiler suggests indexes for your databases
to improve the performance of slow operations.

.. _considerations-profile-database:

Considerations
--------------

.. important:: Please read the following considerations before you enable profiling.

Security
~~~~~~~~

Profile data may include sensitive information including the content of
database queries. Ensure that exposing this data to |mms| is consistent
with your information security practices.

``system.profile`` Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB profiler stores data in the
:data:`system.profile <<database>.system.profile>` collection. |mms|
caps this :term:`collection <capped collection>` to 1 MB as a default.
You may increase the size of this collection up to 4 MB.

When collecting data from the profiler, |mms| ignores operations on
the :data:`system.profile <<database>.system.profile>` collection,
such as {+magent+} queries of the
:data:`system.profile <<database>.system.profile>` collection.

Resource Consumption Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The profiler consumes resources which may slow MongoDB performance.
Consider the resource impact before enabling profiling.

Data Collection
```````````````

Every minute, the agent queries the
:data:`system.profile <<database>.system.profile>` collection for the
last 20 documents created. Monitoring sends
:manual:`those documents </reference/database-profiler>` to |mms|.

.. seealso::

   :manual:`Database Profiler </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>`
   in the MongoDB Manual.

|mms| samples profile documents until it samples either all documents
returned or 4 MB of returned document data. This 4 MB limit may be
reached if you increase the collection's size to 4 MB *and* your
database creates large
:manual:`profiler documents </reference/database-profiler>`.

Monitoring tries to minimize its effect on the monitored systems.
If polling profile data slows database performance, |mms| throttles how
often it collects data.

Data Display
````````````

|mms| displays no more than 10,000 data points in the
:guilabel:`Profiler` charts.

Time to Propagate Changes to the {+mdbagent+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With profiling enabled, configuration changes made in |mms| can
take up to 2 minutes to propagate to the agent and 1 more minute before
profiling data appears in the |mms| interface.

Rolling Restart of ``mongod`` Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _enable-profiling-manually:

Enable Profiling
----------------

To enable profiling:

1. Click :guilabel:`Deployment`, the :guilabel:`Processes` tab, and
   then the :guilabel:`Topology` view.
#. On the line listing the process, click :guilabel:`Metrics`.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Profiler` tab above the charts.
#. Toggle :guilabel:`Profiling` to :guilabel:`On`.

Once profiling is enabled, your mongod instance collects profile data
for operations longer than the slow operation threshold and report them
to |mms|. The threshold for slow operations applies to the entire
|mongod| instance. |mms| defaults this threshold to 100 ms.

.. _profiler-interface:

Profiler Interface
------------------

The Profiler has two sections to the page that display database profile
information: a chart and a table. Each can display different data.

.. _profiler-chart:

Profiling Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _profiler-chart-set-filter:

Set Chart Filters
`````````````````

Above the chart, select the metric and time period you want to see.

1. Select the metric from the :guilabel:`Display` menu. Accepted
   options are:

   - Operation Execution Time (default)
   - Keys Examined
   - Docs Returned
   - Examined:Returned Ratio
   - Num Yields
   - Response Length

#. Select the time period from the :guilabel:`View Last` menu.
   Accepted options are:

   - 24 hr (default)
   - 12 hr
   - 6 hr
   - 1 hr
   - 15 min

.. _profiler-chart-change-slow-ops-threshold:

Change Slow Operations Threshold
````````````````````````````````

To change the slow operations threshold:

1. Click the :guilabel:`Milliseconds` button to the right of the
   :guilabel:`For Operations Longer Than` label to open the
   :guilabel:`Specify the Threshold for Slow Operations` modal.

#. Change the :guilabel:`Set the Threshold for Slow Operations` to your
   desired number of milliseconds.

#. Click :guilabel:`Apply` if you want to change the threshold. Click
   :guilabel:`Cancel` to close the modal without changing the
   threshold.

When you change the threshold, you change it for all databases on the
instance.

.. _profiler-chart-suggest-indexes:

Request Index Suggestions
`````````````````````````

Based on the Profiler data, you may want to improve the performance of
slow queries.

1. Click :guilabel:`Calculate Suggested Indexes` to direct |mms| to
   analyze your databases.

#. After the analysis completes, the
   :guilabel:`Suggested Indexes for Improving Query Performance` modal
   displays.

   This modal offers suggested indexes with the appropriate database
   commands to created those indexes.

#. After you have finished using the suggested indexes, click
   :guilabel:`OK` to close the modal.

.. _profiler-table:
.. _profiler-table-set-filter:

Profiling Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Above the table, select the namespace, operation type, and metric you
wish to profile:

1. Click :guilabel:`All Namespaces` to change which combination of
   databases and collections to profile.

#. Click :guilabel:`All Operations` to change which operations you want
   to profile.

#. Click :guilabel:`Operation Execution Time` to change which metric
   you want to profile. Accepted options are:

   - Operation Execution Time (default)
   - Keys Examined
   - Docs Returned
   - Examined:Returned Ratio
   - Num Yields
   - Response Length
