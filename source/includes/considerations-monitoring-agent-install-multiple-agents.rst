Multiple Monitoring Agents
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can run multiple Monitoring Agents to distribute monitoring assignments
and provide failover. |mms| distributes monitoring assignments among up to 100
running agents. Each agent monitors a different set of MongoDB processes. One
Monitoring Agent per group is the primary agent. The primary agent reports the
cluster's status to |mms|. As agents are added or shut down, |mms|
redistributes assignments. If the primary agent fails, |mms| assigns another
agent to be the primary agent.

.. important:: To distribute monitoring assignments among multiple Monitoring Agents,
               you must use **Monitoring Agent version 5.0.0 or higher**.

If you run more than 100 Monitoring Agents, the additional agents run as
standby agents. A standby agent is completely idle, except to log its status
as a standby and periodically ask |mms| if it should begin monitoring.

For versions of the Monitoring Agent earlier than version 5.0.0, only one
agent handles monitoring assignments. All other running agents are standby agents.
