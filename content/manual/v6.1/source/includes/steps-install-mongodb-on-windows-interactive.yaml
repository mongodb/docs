   The wizard steps you through the installation of MongoDB and MongoDB
   Compass.

   a. :guilabel:`Choose Setup Type`
        You can choose either the :guilabel:`Complete` (recommended for
        most users) or :guilabel:`Custom` setup type. The
        :guilabel:`Complete` setup option installs MongoDB and the
        MongoDB tools to the default location. The :guilabel:`Custom`
        setup option allows you to specify which executables are
        installed and where.

   #. :guilabel:`Service Configuration`
        Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can set up MongoDB as a Windows service
        during the install or just install the binaries.

        .. tabs::

           tabs:

              - id: service
                name: MongoDB Service
                content: |

                   The following installs and configures MongoDB as a Windows
                   service.

                   Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can configure
                   and start MongoDB as a Windows service during the install, and
                   the MongoDB service is started upon successful
                   installation.

                   - Select :guilabel:`Install MongoD as a Service` MongoDB as a service.

                   - Select either:

                     - :guilabel:`Run the service as Network Service user` (Default)

                       This is a Windows user account that is built-in
                       to Windows

                       **or**

                     - :guilabel:`Run the service as a local or domain user`

                       - For an existing local user account, specify a
                         period (i.e. ``.``) for the :guilabel:`Account
                         Domain` and specify the :guilabel:`Account Name` and
                         the :guilabel:`Account Password` for the user.

                       - For an existing domain user, specify the
                         :guilabel:`Account Domain`, the
                         :guilabel:`Account Name` and the
                         :guilabel:`Account Password` for that user.

                   - :guilabel:`Service Name`. Specify the service
                     name. Default name is ``MongoDB``. If you already
                     have a service with the specified name, you must
                     choose another name.

                   - :guilabel:`Data Directory`. Specify the data
                     directory, which corresponds to the
                     :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`. If the
                     directory does not exist, the installer will
                     create the directory and sets the directory access
                     to the service user.

                   - :guilabel:`Log Directory`. Specify the Log
                     directory, which corresponds to the
                     :option:`--logpath <mongod --logpath>`. If the
                     directory does not exist, the installer will
                     create the directory and sets the directory access
                     to the service user.


              - id: mongodb

                   The following installs MongoDB only and does not
                   configure MongoDB as a Windows service.

                   If you choose not to configure MongoDB as a Windows service,
                   uncheck the :guilabel:`Install MongoD as a Service`.
