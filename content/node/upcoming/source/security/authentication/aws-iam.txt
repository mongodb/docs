Overview
--------

The ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism uses Amazon Web Services
Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) credentials to authenticate a user to MongoDB.
You can use this mechanism only when authenticating to MongoDB Atlas.

.. tip:: Configure Atlas for AWS IAM Authentication

   To learn more about configuring MongoDB Atlas for AWS IAM authentication, see
   :atlas:`Set Up Authentication with AWS IAM </security/aws-iam-authentication/>` in
   the Atlas documentation.

Specify MONGODB-AWS Authentication
----------------------------------

The ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism uses your Amazon Web Services
Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) credentials to authenticate your
user. For the {+driver-short+} v7.1.0 and later, the `aws4 <https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws4>`__ 
package is no longer required for AWS authentication, so you do not need to 
install the ``aws4`` package.

To connect to a MongoDB instance with ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication
enabled, specify the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism.

The driver checks for your credentials in the following sources in order:

1. Custom credential provider (if provided to the ``MongoClient``)
#. Environment variables available through process.env
#. SSO credentials from the token cache
#. Web identity token credentials through the ``AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE``
#. Shared credentials and config ``.ini`` files
#. EC2 or ECS Instance Metadata Service. For more information, see `IAM Roles for Tasks
   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html>`_.

.. important::

   The driver only reads the credentials from the first method that it detects
   in the order as given by the preceding list. For example, if you specify 
   your AWS credentials in environment variables, the driver ignores any 
   credentials that you specified in a web identity token file.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Environment Variables
      :tabid: environment variables

      To authenticate to your MongoDB instance using AWS credentials stored in
      environment variables available through process.env, set the following 
      variables by using a shell:

      .. code-block:: bash

         export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<awsKeyId>
         export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<awsSecretKey>
         export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<awsSessionToken>

      .. note::

         Omit the line containing ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` if you don't need an AWS
         session token for that role.

      AWS recommends using regional AWS STS endpoints instead of global 
      endpoints to reduce latency, build-in redundancy, and increase session token validity.
      To set the AWS region, set `AWS_REGION <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-region.html>`__ 
      and `AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-sts-regionalized-endpoints.html>`__
      as environment variables, as shown in the following example: 

      .. code-block:: bash
         
         export AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS=regional // Enables regional endpoints
         export AWS_REGION=us-east-1 // Sets your AWS region
         
      If both these environment variables aren't set, the default region is 
      ``us-east-1``. For a list of available AWS regions, see the
      `Regional Endpoints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#regional-endpoints>`__ 
      section of the AWS Service Endpoints reference in the AWS documentation. 
      
      After you've set the preceding environment variables, specify the ``MONGODB-AWS``
      authentication mechanism in your connection string as shown in the following example:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/authentication/aws-env-variable.js
         :language: javascript
      
   .. tab:: Web Identity Token File
      :tabid: web-identity-token-file

      You can use the OpenID Connect (OIDC) token obtained from a web identity
      provider to authenticate to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or
      other services.

      To authenticate with your OIDC token you must first install
      `@aws-sdk/credential-providers
      <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-sdk/credential-providers>`__. You can
      install this dependency using the following ``npm`` command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         npm install @aws-sdk/credential-providers

      Next, create a file that contains your OIDC token. Then 
      set the absolute path to this file in an environment variable by using
      a shell as shown in the following example:

      .. code-block:: bash

         export AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE=<absolute path to file containing your OIDC token>

      After you've set the preceding environment variable, specify the ``MONGODB-AWS``
      authentication mechanism in your connection string as shown in the following example:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/authentication/aws-env-variable.js
         :language: javascript

Manually Specify AWS Credentials
--------------------------------

When you install the optional ``aws-sdk/credential-providers`` dependency, the driver
retrieves credentials in a priority order defined by the AWS SDK. If you have a shared AWS
credentials file or config file, the driver uses those credentials by default.

.. tip::

   To learn more about how the ``aws-sdk/credential-providers`` dependency retrieves
   credentials, see the `AWS SDK documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/Package/-aws-sdk-credential-providers/#fromnodeproviderchain>`__.

To manually specify the AWS credentials to retrieve, you can set the ``AWS_CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER``
property to a defined credential provider from the AWS SDK. The following example passes a provider chain
from the AWS SDK to the AWS authentication mechanism:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/authentication/aws-custom-credentials.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: // start-custom-credentials
   :end-before: // end-custom-credentials
   :dedent:

To use a custom provider, you can pass any asynchronous function that returns your credentials
to the ``AWS_CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER`` authentication mechanism property. The following example shows how to pass
a custom provider function that fetches credentials from environment variables to the
AWS authentication mechanism:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/authentication/aws-custom-credentials.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: // start-custom-credentials-function
   :end-before: // end-custom-credentials-function
   :dedent:

A custom credential provider takes precedence over any other form of authentication.
