Project Settings
----------------

:guilabel:`Project Settings` apply to all the users in the project.

   * - Setting

     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Project`

     - Sets your project's name.

       Only users with :authrole:`Project Owner` access for the
       project can edit the project name.

   * - :guilabel:`Project Time Zone`

     - Sets your project's time zone.
       
       Only users with :authrole:`Project Owner` access for the
       project can edit the project time zone.

   * - :guilabel:`Collect Logs For All Hosts`

     - Activates or deactivates the collection of log data for all
       hosts. This overwrites the statuses set on the individual hosts.

   * - :guilabel:`Collect Profiling Information for All Hosts`

     - Activates or deactivates |mms| collection of data from the
       MongoDB :manual:`database profilers </tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler>`
       running on your :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` instances. A :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>`
       instance must have its profiler enabled in order for |mms| to
       collect data from it.

       When you change this setting, |mms| applies the change globally
       to all :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` processes in the project. For example,
       if you disable this setting, |mms| disables the collection of
       profiling data for all the project's processes. This setting
       does not affect whether the profiler is enabled on a given
       :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` process, only whether |mms| collects profiling
       data.

       To enable the collection of profiling data on a
       process-by-process basis, see :doc:`/tutorial/profile-database`.

       When profiling is enabled, |mms| collects data from MongoDB’s
       profiler to provide statistics about performance and database
       operations. Ensure exposing profile data to |mms| is consistent
       with your information security practices. Also be aware the
       profiler can consume resources which may adversely affect
       MongoDB performance.

       For more information, see :doc:`/tutorial/profile-database`.

   * - :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics`

     - Allows you to enable or disable the collection of database
       statistics. For more information, see
       :doc:`/tutorial/profile-database`.

   * - :guilabel:`Default Project Server Type`

     - Sets the default server type for all hosts added to this
       project. This does *not* modify the default server type of existing hosts.

       .. include:: /includes/list-table-server-types.rst

          

   * - :guilabel:`Reset Duplicates`

     - Allows you to reset and remove all detected duplicate hosts.
       This is useful if your server environment has drastically
       changed and you believe a host is incorrectly marked as a
       duplicate.

   * - :guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames`

     - Allows you to specify resolvable hostnames or |ipaddr| addresses
       for your deployment's host. |mms| keeps a list of the multiple
       ways to which each host is referred (hostname, |fqdn|, |ipv4|
       address, |ipv6| address) and uses heuristics to determine the
       best choice. Specify a preferred hostname to make sure |mms|
       uses a hostname that can resolve to a host. The method you
       choose becomes the method used to display the hosts in |mms|.

       To specify a preferred hostname, click :guilabel:`Add` and do
       one of the following:

       - To specify hostnames that end with a particular string, click
         the :guilabel:`Ends With` button and enter the string.

       - To specify hostnames that match a pattern, click the
         :guilabel:`Regex` button and enter a regular expression. An
         expression that uses "starts with" behavior must have ``.*``
         at the end in order to correctly match. 
         
         For example, to specify hostnames that start with ``acme-``, enter the following regular expression:

         .. code-block:: none

            ^acme-.*

   * - :guilabel:`Suppress Mongos Automatic Discovery`

     - Suppresses automatic discovery of all :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>`
       processes in your deployment's sharded clusters.

   * - :guilabel:`Real Time Performance Panel`

     - Enables the collection and display of real time metrics from
       your MongoDB databases in the
       :guilabel:`Real-Time Performance Panel`

       If you toggle :guilabel:`Real-Time Performance Panel` to
       ``Off``, you disable this feature for every user in the Project.

       You might see some |pii| if you have permission to use this
       feature.

   * - :guilabel:`Data Explorer`

     - Enables the ability to query of your MongoDB databases from
       |mms|.

       If you toggle :guilabel:`Data Explorer` to ``Off``, you disable
       this feature for every user in the Project.

       You might see some |pii| if you have permission to use this
       feature.

   * - :guilabel:`Performance Advisor`

     - Enables the ability to analyze the logs of your MongoDB database
       to recommend performance improvements.

       If you toggle :guilabel:`Performance Advisor` to ``Off``, you
       disable this feature for every user in the Project.

       You might see some |pii| if you have permission to use this
       feature.

   * - :guilabel:`Delete Project`

     - Click :guilabel:`Delete` to remove the project from |mms|. The
       :guilabel:`Delete Project` modal displays. Click
       :guilabel:`Delete Project` to confirm your decision.
