Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use a connection string and ``MongoDB\Client`` object
to connect to different types of MongoDB deployments.

.. _php-connection-atlas:

Atlas
-----

To connect to a MongoDB deployment on Atlas, include the following elements
in your connection string:

- URI of your Atlas cluster
- Database username
- Database user's password

Then, pass your connection string to the ``MongoDB\Client`` constructor.

When you connect to Atlas, we recommend using the {+stable-api+} client option to avoid
breaking changes when Atlas upgrades to a new version of {+mdb-server+}.
To learn more about the {+stable-api+} feature, see the :ref:`{+stable-api+} page
<php-stable-api>`.

The following code shows how to use the {+library-short+} to connect to an Atlas cluster.
The code also uses the ``serverApi`` option to specify a {+stable-api+} version.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/atlas.php
   :copyable: true
   :language: php

.. tip::

   Follow the :ref:`php-connection-string` step of the Quick Start
   to retrieve your connection string.

.. _php-connection-local:

Local Deployments
-----------------

To connect to a local MongoDB deployment, use ``localhost`` as the hostname. By
default, the ``mongod`` process runs on port 27017, though you can customize this for
your deployment.

The following code shows how to use the {+library-short+} to connect to a local MongoDB
deployment:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/client.php
   :language: php
   :copyable: true

.. _php-connection-replica-set:

Replica Sets
------------

To connect to a replica set, specify the hostnames (or IP addresses) and 
port numbers of the replica set members in your connection string.

If you aren't able to provide a full list of hosts in the replica set, you can 
specify one or more of the hosts in the replica set and instruct the {+library-short+} to 
perform automatic discovery to find the others. To instruct the driver to perform
automatic discovery, choose one of the following actions:

- Specify the name of the replica set as the value of the ``replicaSet`` parameter.
- Specify ``false`` as the value of the ``directConnection`` parameter.
- Specify more than one host in the replica set.

In the following example, the driver uses a sample connection URI to connect to the 
MongoDB replica set ``sampleRS``, which is running on port ``27017`` of three different
hosts, including ``host1``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/replica-set.php
   :language: php
   :copyable: true

Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To initialize a replica set, you must connect directly to a single member. To do so,
set the ``directConnection`` connection
option to ``true`` in the connection string. The following code example shows how to
set this connection option: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/direct-connection.php
   :language: php
   :copyable: true
