.. dbcommand:: replSetResizeOplog

.. versionadded:: 3.6

   The :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` dynamically resizes a replica
   set members's oplog to satisfy the operational needs in a replica 
   set. It bypasses the need to perform a maintenance 
   operation to resize the oplog and may only be run against the 
   ``admin`` database.

   This feature is only available for nodes running on the WiredTiger
   storage engine. If you are using the MMAPv1 storage engine, see 
   :doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size` to follow the maintenance 
   procedure.

   The command has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetResizeOplog: <boolean>, size: <num MB> }

   .. note::

      :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` takes the size parameter 
      in megabytes, while the oplog size is stored in bytes. The size 
      parameter must also be over 990 megabytes.

Example
--------

Use the :dbcommand:`stats` command to display the current oplog size, 
``maxSize``. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   use local
   db.oplog.rs.stats().maxSize

The above command will return the oplog size of this member:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   "maxSize": NumberLong("9790804377")

``maxSize`` is currently 9790804377 bytes, or 9337 megabytes.

The following command changes the oplog size of this member to 
17179869184 bytes, or 16384 megabytes.

To change the size, run the :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog`, passing
the desired size in megabytes as a parameter.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.runCommand({replSetResizeOplog:1, size: 16384})
   { "ok" : 1, "operationTime" : Timestamp(1500329291, 1) }

To verify the new oplog size, rerun the :dbcommand:`stats` command:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   use local
   db.oplog.rs.stats().maxSize

The above command returns:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   "maxSize": NumberLong("17179869184")

.. warning::

   Reducing the size of the oplog in a node removes data from it. This 
   may cause replica members syncing with that node to become stale. 
   To resync those members, see :ref:`resync-replica-set-member`.
