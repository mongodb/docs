ref: _maxStalenessSeconds
content: |
  When the {{mode}} read preference includes a :ref:`maxStalenessSeconds value
  <replica-set-read-preference-max-staleness>`{{noPrimary}},
  the client estimates how stale each
  secondary is by comparing the secondary's last write
  to that of the {{compare}}. The client then directs the read operation to a
  secondary whose estimated lag is less than or equal to ``maxStalenessSeconds``.

    If there is no primary, the client uses the secondary with the most

    estimated lag less than or equal to ``maxStalenessSeconds``, the
    client directs the read operation to the replica set's primary.

ref: _tagSets
content: |
  When the read preference includes a :ref:`tag set list (an array of tag
  sets) <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`{{noPrimary}},
  the client attempts to find secondary members with matching tags
  (trying the tag sets in order until a match is found). If
  matching secondaries are found, the client selects a
  random secondary from the :ref:`nearest group
  <replica-set-read-preference-behavior-nearest>` of matching
  secondaries. If no secondaries have matching tags, {{behavior}}

    From the remaining :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, the client then
    randomly directs the read to an instance that falls within the
    acceptable latency window. The read preference :ref:`member

  Read operations using the {{mode}} mode may return stale data. Use the
  ``maxStalenessSeconds`` option to avoid reading from secondaries
  that the client estimates are overly stale.
