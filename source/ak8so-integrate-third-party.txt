You can use |ak8so| to integrate |service| with third-party services to:

- Receive |service| alerts in various third-party services.
- View and analyze :ref:`performance metrics <monitor-cluster-metrics>` 
  that |service| collects about your {+cluster+}.
  
To learn more, see :ref:`third-party-integrations`.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-api-key-permission.rst

To learn more, see :ref:`ak8so-access-to-atlas-ref`.

Procedure
---------

To integrate |service| with a third-party service, configure the 
:ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: sh

   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
   kind: AtlasProject
   metadata:
     name: my-project
   spec:
     name: TestDatadogIntegration
     connectionSecretRef:
       name: my-atlas-key
     projectIpAccessList:
       - cidrBlock: "0.0.0.0/1"
         comment: "Everyone has access. For test purposes only."
       - cidrBlock: "128.0.0.0/1"
         comment: "Everyone has access. For test purposes only."
     integrations:
       - type: "DATADOG"
         apiKeyRef:
           name: key-name
           namespace: key-namespace
         region: "US"
    EOF

The parameters that you must specify in the 
:ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource` depend on the third-party service 
that you want to configure:

.. include:: /includes/list-tabel-integration-settings.rst

For another example, see :ref:`prometheus-example`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-grafana.rst

To learn more about the configuration parameters available from 
the |api|, see the |service| :oas-atlas-op:`Third-Party Integration 
Settings </configureOneThird-PartyServiceIntegration>`.
