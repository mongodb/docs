Indexes
-------

Each index on a collection adds some amount of overhead to the
performance of write operations.

For each :dbcommand:`insert` or :dbcommand:`delete` write operation
on a collection, MongoDB either inserts or removes the corresponding
document keys from each index in the target collection. An
:dbcommand:`update` operation may result in updates to a subset of
indexes on the collection, depending on the keys affected by the update.

.. note::

   MongoDB only updates a :ref:`sparse <index-type-sparse>` or
   :ref:`partial <index-type-partial>` index if the documents involved
   in a write operation are included in the index.

On :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances that use the
:ref:`MMAPv1 <storage-mmapv1>` storage engine, update operations may
cause a document to grow beyond its allocated space.
When a document outgrows its allocated space, MMAPv1 moves
the document to a new location on disk, and must
update each index on the collection to point to the new document
location. These move operations can be expensive but occur
infrequently.

In general, the performance gains that indexes provide for *read
operations* are worth the insertion penalty. However, in order to
optimize write performance when possible, be careful when creating new
indexes and evaluate the existing indexes to ensure that your queries
actually use these indexes.

For indexes and queries, see :doc:`/core/query-optimization`. For more
information on indexes, see :doc:`/indexes` and
:doc:`/applications/indexes`.

Document Growth and the MMAPv1 Storage Engine
---------------------------------------------

Some update operations can increase the size of the document; for
instance, if an update adds a new field to the document.

For the MMAPv1 storage engine, if an update operation causes a document
to exceed the currently allocated :term:`record size`, MongoDB
relocates the document on disk with enough contiguous space to hold the
document. Updates that require relocations take longer than updates
that do not, particularly if the collection has indexes. If a
collection has indexes, MongoDB must update all index entries. Thus,
for a collection with many indexes, the move will impact the write
throughput.

.. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

   By default, MongoDB uses :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` to add
   :ref:`padding automatically <record-allocation-strategies>` for the
   MMAPv1 storage engine. The :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` ensures that
   MongoDB allocates document space in sizes that are powers of 2,
   which helps ensure that MongoDB can efficiently reuse free space
   created by document deletion or relocation as well as reduce the
   occurrences of reallocations in many cases.

Although :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` minimizes the
occurrence of re-allocation, it does not eliminate document
re-allocation.

See :doc:`/core/mmapv1` for more information.

Storage Performance
-------------------

Hardware
~~~~~~~~

The capability of the storage system creates some important physical
limits for the performance of MongoDB's write operations. Many unique
factors related to the storage system of the drive affect write
performance, including random access patterns, disk caches,
disk readahead and RAID configurations.

Solid state drives (SSDs) can outperform spinning hard disks (HDDs) by
100 times or more for random workloads.

.. see:: :doc:`/administration/production-notes` for recommendations
   regarding additional hardware and configuration options.

Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~

To provide durability in the event of a crash, MongoDB uses *write
ahead logging* to an on-disk :term:`journal`. MongoDB writes the
in-memory changes first to the on-disk journal files. If MongoDB should
terminate or encounter an error before committing the changes to the
data files, MongoDB can use the journal files to apply the write
operation to the data files.

While the durability assurance provided by the journal typically
outweigh the performance costs of the additional write operations,
consider the following interactions between the journal and
performance:

- If the journal and the data file reside on the same block device,
  the data files and the journal may have to contend for a finite
  number of available I/O resources. Moving the journal to a
  separate device may increase the capacity for write operations.

- If applications specify :doc:`write concerns </reference/write-concern>`
  that include the :writeconcern:`j option <j>`,
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` will decrease the duration between journal
  writes, which can increase the overall write load.

- The duration between journal writes is configurable using the
  :setting:`~storage.journal.commitIntervalMs` run-time option. Decreasing the
  period between journal commits will increase the number of write
  operations, which can limit MongoDB's capacity for write
  operations. Increasing the amount of time between journal commits may
  decrease the total number of write operation, but also increases the
  chance that the journal will not record a write operation in the
  event of a failure.

For additional information on journaling, see
:doc:`/core/journaling`.
