     You can use |helm| to install the

  By default, The |k8s-op-short| uses the ``mongodb`` namespace. To
  simplify your installation, consider creating a namespace labeled
  ``mongodb`` using the following |kubectl| command:

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl create namespace mongodb

  If you do not want to use the ``mongodb`` namespace, you can label
  your namespace anything you like:

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl create namespace <namespaceName>

optional: true

  If you don't deploy an |onprem| resource with the
  |k8s-op-short|, you must have an |onprem| running outside of your
  |k8s| cluster. If you will deploy an |onprem| resource in |k8s| with
  the |k8s-op-short|, skip this prerequisite.

  .. important::

     Your |onprem| installation must run an active |ntp| service. If
     the |onprem| host's clock falls out of sync, that host can't
     communicate with the |k8s-op-short|. 

     To learn how to check your |ntp| service for your |onprem|
     host, see the documentation for `RHEL
     <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/s1-checking_the_status_of_ntp>`__.
