Prerequisite
------------

Get and Install the TLS Certificate on Each MongoDB Host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Acquire a |tls| certificate for each host serving a MongoDB process.
This certificate must include the |fqdn| for the hostname of this
MongoDB host. The |fqdn| must be the Subject Alternative Name of this 
host. You must install this |tls| certificate on the MongoDB host.

         You must complete:

         1. :ref:`Set Existing Deployments to Use TLS <set-existing-ssl>`,
            then
         2. :ref:`Enable TLS for the Project <set-project-ssl>`

         before you click :guilabel:`Review & Deploy`.

      .. _set-existing-ssl:

      Set Existing Deployments to Use |tls|
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      If you wish to enable |tls| for existing MongoDB deployments in your
      |mms| project:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-ssl-for-existing-deployment.rst

      .. _set-project-ssl:

      Enable |tls| for the Project
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-ssl-for-group.rst

      - If you updated to the {+mdbagent+} from deployments that used
        Automation, the {+mdbagent+} manages the |tls| settings.

      - If you updated to the {+mdbagent+} from deployments that did not
        use Automation but you had Backup Agents, Monitoring Agents, or
        both, you *can* set your *Backup Agent and Monitoring
        Agent-specific* settings during the Agent update or through the
        following procedure:

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-deployment.rst

         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-agents.rst

         .. step:: Edit the configuration.

            a. Click :guilabel:`Downloads & Settings`,

               in the :guilabel:`Setting` box and its corresponding 
               value in the :guilabel:`Value` box.

            #. To add more than one :guilabel:`Setting`, click the
               :guilabel:`+ Add Setting` link. Another row appears.

      to allow the MongoDB monitoring agent to connect to the TLS-enabled 
      monitored cluster.
