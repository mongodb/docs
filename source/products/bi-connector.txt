The MongoDB Connector for BI (Business Intelligence)
allows users to visualize their MongoDB Enterprise data using existing
relational business intelligence tools such as Tableau.

These tools expect to connect to a data source and find data in tabular form
following a fixed schema. This presents a challenge when working with MongoDB's
:doc:`flexible schema </data-modeling>` and rich, multi-dimensional, documents.

The MongoDB Connector for BI acts as a layer that passes queries and
data between a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance and your
reporting tool. It uses a foreign data wrapper with PostgreSQL to provide a
relational :term:`SQL` view into your MongoDB data.

Using this model, the MongoDB Connector for BI components store no data,
and purely serve to bridge your MongoDB server with business intelligence
tools.

Installation
------------

.. note::

   The MongoDB Connector for BI works only with MongoDB versions 3.2 and
   greater.

To set up the MongoDB Connector for BI with a business intelligence tool
such as Tableau, follow the steps in this section.

Schema Configuration
--------------------

Business Intelligence tools connect to a data source and, given a fixed
tabular schema, allow the user to visually explore their data. However,
because MongoDB uses a :doc:`flexible schema </data-modeling>`, these tools
currently cannot use MongoDB as a native data source.

To use MongoDB with a relational business intelligence tool such as Tableau,
you must define a relational mapping for your MongoDB data.

The schema generation tool :program:`mongodrdl` will output such a schema in the
:ref:`Document Relational Definition Language <drdl>` (DRDL) format, but you
should verify that the schema it proposes matches your data requirements.
Examine both the table structure and field types to ensure that you will be
able to generate your desired reports.

You may have to edit the schema definition files by hand to remove unneeded
fields; add fields that :program:`mongodrdl` did not discover within the subset
of documents that it sampled; and modify erroneous field types.

You may edit DRDL files in the following ways:

- Add :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` stages,
- Add fields,
- Remove fields,
- Remove tables,
- Rename tables, so long as the ``collection`` field remains the same,
- Rename fields using the ``sqlname`` option

.. versionadded:: 1.1

   Rename fields using the ``sqlname`` option.

.. _drdl:

Document Relational Definition Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Document Relational Definition Language (``DRDL``) defines a relational
view of a MongoDB schema.

:program:`mongodrdl` produces these files using one or more MongoDB collections
as a guideline, and :program:`mongobischema` imports them into the Business
Intelligence Connector.

File Format
```````````

Using the `YAML <https://yaml.org/>`_ format, the ``DRDL`` file lists the
databases, tables, and columns to be "exported" for use in Business
Intelligence tools.

.. code-block:: yaml

   schema:
   - db: <database name>
     tables:
     - table: <SQL table name>
       collection: <MongoDB collection name>
       pipeline:
       - <optional pipeline elements>
       columns:
       - name: <MongoDB field name>
         sqlname: <mapped SQL column name>
         mongotype: <MongoDB field type>
         sqltype: <mapped SQL column type>

Example

Field Types
~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB Connector for BI will correctly map fields that
always contain the same data type into the relational model. Schema generation
will deal specially with the following cases:

Dates
  The connector will treat any field of type :bsontype:`data_date` as the
  :term:`SQL` ``timestamp`` type.

Timestamps
  The connector will treat any field of type :bsontype:`data_timestamp` as a
  ``varchar`` string type.

Geospatial
  .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

  If a collection contains a
  :doc:`geospatial index </applications/geospatial-indexes>`, the connector will
  map the indexed field into an array of numeric longitude-latitude coordinates.

  See :ref:`bi-geospatial` for an example.

Heterogeneous Fields
  If a field can contain multiple types, :program:`mongodrdl` will pick the type
  that appears most frequently.

  If a field can contain either a string or an array of strings, the generated
  schema will always specify that the field contains an array of strings.

Embedded Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB Connector for BI will map embedded documents to simple fields
that have a ``.`` separator character, making them appear similar to the way you
would reference them using :ref:`dot notation <document-dot-notation>` in a
MongoDB query.

While Tableau properly quotes identifiers, within "ad-hoc"
SQL expressions you must double-quote every identifier that contains ``.``
characters or mixed-case characters.

For example, consider the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "_id": 1,
       "familyName": "Partridge",
       "hometown" : "Hollywood Hills",
       "address" : { "street": "123 Main Street",
                     "city" : "Hollywood",
                     "state" : "CA",
                     "zip" : "90210" },
       "members_since" : ISODate("2002-04-12T00:00:00Z")
   }

This will result in the following fields in the generated schema:

.. list-table::

   * - ``_id``

     - ``numeric``

   * - ``familyName``

     - ``varchar``

   * - ``hometown``

     - ``varchar``

   * - ``address.street``

     - ``varchar``

   * - ``address.city``

     - ``varchar``

   * - ``address.state``

     - ``varchar``

   * - ``address.zip``

     - ``varchar``

   * - ``members_since``

     - ``timestamp``

Arrays
~~~~~~

The MongoDB Connector for BI exposes arrays to business
intelligence tools using two collections: one without the array, and the other
with the array "pre-joined" to its parent.

For example, consider the following document in the collection ``families``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id": 1,
      "familyName": "Partridge",
      "hometown" : "Hollywood Hills",
      "familyMembers" : [
        {
            "firstname" : "Shirley",
            "age" : 42,
            "attributes" : [
                { "name" : "instrument", "value" : "singer" },
                { "name" : "role", "value" : "mom" }
            ]
        },
        {
            "firstname" : "Keith",
            "age" : 18,
            "attributes" : [
                { "name" : "instrument", "value" : "guitar" },
                { "name" : "role", "value" : "son" }
            ]
        },
        {
            "firstname" : "Laurie",
            "age" : 16,
            "attributes" : [
                { "name" : "instrument", "value" : "keyboard" },
                { "name" : "role", "value" : "sister" }
            ]
        }]
   }

This will result in the following three tables:

``families``
  .. list-table::

     * - ``_id``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyName``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``hometown``

       - ``varchar``

``families_familyMembers``
  .. list-table::

     * - ``_id``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyMembers.age``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyMembers.firstname``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``familyMembers_idx``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyName``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``hometown``

       - ``varchar``

``families_familyMembers_attributes``
  .. list-table::

     * - ``_id``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyMembers.age``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyMembers.attributes.name``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``familyMembers.attributes.value``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``familyMembers.attributes_idx``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyMembers.firstname``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``familyMembers_idx``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyName``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``hometown``

       - ``varchar``

Aggregation Pipelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB Connector for BI can use
:ref:`aggregation pipelines <aggregation-pipeline>` as part of the schema to
transform documents from the collection into the proper form for the relational
tables.

For example, consider a simple document in the collection ``simpleFamilies``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id": 1,
      "familyName": "Partridge",
      "familyMembers" : [ "Shirley", "Keith", "Laurie"]
   }


:program:`mongodrdl` will generate a schema with the tables ``simpleFamilies``
and ``simpleFamilies_familyMembers``.

The table ``simpleFamilies_familyMembers`` enumerates each family members, and
has the following pipeline:

.. code-block:: yaml

   pipeline:
   - $unwind:
       includeArrayIndex: familyMembers_idx
       path: $familyMembers

This pipeline uses :pipeline:`$unwind` to create a new record for each member of
``familyMembers``. The schema will track the array index in the field
``familyMembers_idx``.

.. _bi-geospatial:

Geospatial Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.1.0

If a collection contains a
:doc:`geospatial index </applications/geospatial-indexes>`, the connector will
map the indexed field into an array of numeric longitude-latitude coordinates.

For example, given the following collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.points.createIndex( { pos : "2dsphere" } )
   db.points.insert({
       pos : { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.97, 40.77 ] },
       name: "Central Park",
       category : "Parks"
   })

:program:`mongodrdl` will generate the following schema:

.. code-block:: yaml

   schema:
   - db: test
     tables:
     - table: points
       collection: points
       pipeline: []
       columns:
       - name: _id
         mongotype: bson.ObjectId
         sqlname: _id
         sqltype: varchar
       - name: category
         mongotype: string
         sqlname: category
         sqltype: varchar
       - name: name
         mongotype: string
         sqlname: name
         sqltype: varchar
       - name: pos.coordinates
         mongotype: geo.2darray
         sqlname: pos.coordinates
         sqltype: numeric[]
