This complete Docker Compose example sets up a local |service-fullname| 
cluster with persistent data. Review the complete Docker Compose file, 
and each component, to understand its purpose and configuration. To 
learn more, see :ref:`atlas-cli-deploy-docker`.

Docker Compose File
-------------------

The following example creates a local |service| cluster using the 
``mongodb/mongodb-atlas-local`` image. The file configures networking, 
mounts the correct data volumes for seeding the database and 
persisting data, and Atlas Search indexes.

.. code-block:: sh
   :linenos: 

   services:
     mongodb:
       image: mongodb/mongodb-atlas-local
       hostname: mongodb
       environment:
         - MONGODB_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=user
         - MONGODB_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass
       ports:
         - 27017:27017
       volumes:
         - ./init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
         - db:/data/db
         - configdb:/data/configdb
         - mongot:/data/mongot
   volumes:
     db:
     configdb:
     mongot:

Use the following information to provision your local |service| cluster 
with your own data, and persist your configuration and data.

File Structure
--------------

The Docker Compose file has the following main parameters:

- ``services`` defines the containers to run. In this example, a single 
  service named ``mongodb`` defines the MongoDB service. You might have 
  other services required for your complete application to run.

- ``volumes`` defines the persistent storage locations that you can 
  share among containers. This example shows the persistent storage 
  locations required for the MongoDB service to operate.

Service Configuration
---------------------

Image
~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

   image: mongodb/mongodb-atlas-local

*Required*

This parameter defines the local |service-fullname| image. This 
defintion uses the latest version of the image and is equivalent to 
using the ``:latest`` tag. If your organization requires you to use a 
specific image build, you can append ``@sha256:<digest>``. If you want 
to use a specific version of MongoDB with the latest OS updates, use 
the version number tags. For example, 
``mongodb/mongodb-atlas-local:8.0.6``

Hostname
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

   hostname: mongodb

*Required*

This parameter defines the hostname for the container. You must 
specify this correctly for the local replica set to function. This 
parameter is required to ensure communication between the different 
services within the same Docker Container network. You can refer to 
this container by the same hostname, ``mongodb``.

Environment Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authentication
``````````````

.. code-block:: sh
   :emphasize-lines: 2-3

   environment:
     - MONGODB_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=user
     - MONGODB_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass

*Recommended*

The highlighted ``environment`` parameters set the initial root 
username and password for the local |service| cluster. For simplicity, 
in this example, the credentials are defined in the Docker Compose file 
itself, but you can abstract the credientials into an environment 
variable.

Logging
```````

.. code-block:: sh
   :emphasize-lines: 4-5

   environment:
     - MONGODB_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=user
     - MONGODB_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass
     - MONGOT_LOG_FILE=/dev/stderr
     - RUNNER_LOG_FILE=/dev/stderr

*Optional*

The highlighted ``environment`` parameters define logging to help 
diagnose any issues.  ``mongot``, which provides the |fts| 
capabilities, generates the ``MONGOT_LOG_FILE``. This example outputs 
the ``mongot`` logs to the ``stderr`` directory. The runner service 
generates the ``RUNNER_LOG_FILE``. The runner service monitors the 
process that creates ``mongod`` and configures the integration with 
``mongot``. This example outputs the runner logs to the ``stderr`` 
directory.  

Volumes
~~~~~~~

Volumes persist data and the configuration across container restarts.

Initialization
``````````````

.. code-block:: sh
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   volumes:
     - ./init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d

*Conditional*

The highlighted ``volumes`` parameter mounts the local ``init`` 
directory to the container's initialization directory. Typically, the 
``init`` directory is placed in the project, and when you run 
``docker-compose up``, the process searches for any initialization 
scripts in this directory. Supported file types include:

- ``.js`` MongoDB shell scripts
- ``.sh`` Bash scripts

For example, when you place the following script in the ``init`` 
folder:

1. The script retrieves an example sample data set.
#. Confirms the data set downloaded.
#. Uses ``mongorestore``, which the local |service-fullname| container 
   image provides, to restore the archive into the new local |service| 
   cluster.
#. Confirms the data loaded.

.. code-block:: sh

   # init/init.sh
   #!/bin/bash

   curl -O https://atlas-education.s3.amazonaws.com/sampledata.archive
   echo "Sample data downloaded."
   mongorestore --uri "$CONNECTION_STRING" --archive=./sampledata.archive
   echo "Sample data loaded successfully."

.. note:: Connection String

   Since building your connection string during the seeding process 
   might be challenging, especially when you switch between your local 
   machine and the Docker network, the ``$CONNECTION_STRING`` 
   environment variable, is automatically provided during the seeding 
   process.

Data
````

.. code-block:: sh
   :emphasize-lines: 3, 7

       volumes:
         - ./init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
         - db:/data/db
         - configdb:/data/configdb
         - mongot:/data/mongot
   volumes:
     db:
     configdb:
     mongot:

*Conditional*

MongoDB stores its data in the ``/data/db`` directory by default. In 
this Docker Compose file, the ``/data/db`` directory is then mapped to 
the ``db`` volume for the MongoDB service. The ``volumes`` parameters 
at the end of the Docker Compose file declare the volumes that other 
services can use, including the ``db`` volume mapped in the mongodb 
service. The ``db`` volume acts as a storage location outside the 
container, preserving data across container restarts.

Configuration
`````````````

.. code-block:: sh
   :emphasize-lines: 4, 8

       volumes:
         - ./init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
         - db:/data/db
         - configdb:/data/configdb
         - mongot:/data/mongot
   volumes:
     db:
     configdb:
     mongot:

*Conditional*

By default, MongoDB stores its configuration data in the 
``/data/configdb`` directory, which persists in the same way as the 
stored data.

Atlas Search (``mongot``)
`````````````````````````

.. code-block:: sh
   :emphasize-lines: 5, 9

       volumes:
         - ./init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
         - db:/data/db
         - configdb:/data/configdb
         - mongot:/data/mongot
   volumes:
     db:
     configdb:
     mongot:

*Conditional*

The local |service-fullname| image (``mongodb/mongodb-atlas-local``) 
comes with ``mongot``, which provides the |fts| and {+avs+} 
capabilities. By default, ``mongot`` stores indexes in the
``/data/mongot`` directory. This volume is mapped, mounted, and its 
data persists across runs in the same way as the configuration and 
stored data. 

Verify that Processes are Healthy
---------------------------------

The local |service| implementation simplifies configuring the MongoDB 
process (``mongod``), and Search capabilities (``mongot)``. During 
initialization, these processes must start and restart. In some cases 
the container may be running, but the process you require is not ready. 
The local |service-fullname| image also provides a health check. 

You can use the health check to ensure that the MongoDB, and Search 
capability processes, as well as any initialization scripts are fully 
ready.

In your scripts, include the following code: 

.. code-block:: sh

   timeout 120 bash -c 'until [ "$(docker inspect --format='\''{{.State.Health.Status}}'\''<container-name>)" = "healthy" ]; do sleep 2; done'

You can also do a health check when you use Docker Compose.

Use Docker Compose
------------------

To start the service, run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   docker-compose up

You can append ``-d`` to run the service in detached mode.

To stop the service, run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh
    
   docker-compose down

You can append ``-v`` to remove the volumes and clear the data. Use 
this option if you don't want to persist data or configuration changes, 
or want to ensure you are re-starting from a fresh container.

To verify whether the service is healthy when you run 
``docker-compose up``, add the ``condition: service_healthy`` parameter:

.. code-block:: sh

   api:
       depends_on:
         atlas_local:
           condition: service_healthy
