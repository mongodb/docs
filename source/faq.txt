Can I bring an existing MongoDB deployment into |service-fullname| for management?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. However, you can upload data from existing MongoDB deployment into
|service-fullname|.

- You can use the :doc:`Live Migrate </import/live-import>` feature
  in |service| to migrate from a source replica set to an |service|
  replica set cluster.

- You can use the :doc:`Live Migrate </import/live-import-sharded>`
  feature in |service| to migrate from a source sharded cluster to
  an |service| sharded cluster.

- You can use |mongomirror| to migrate data from an existing
  MongoDB replica set into |service-fullname|.

- You can use |mongodump| and |mongorestore| to seed |service-fullname|
  clusters from an existing standalone, replica set, and sharded
  cluster.

To learn more, see :doc:`/import`.

You can also write scripts using official MongoDB supported drivers to
upload data.

Which versions of MongoDB does |service| use for the clusters?
--------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-mongodb-version.rst

.. _atlas-eol-upgrade:

What happens to |service| clusters using a MongoDB version nearing end of life?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. admonition:: Unsupported MongoDB Versions in |service|
   :class: note

   |service| no longer supports MongoDB {+latest-mongodb-eol+} and
   earlier.

MongoDB sends you an email notification at least six months before the
MongoDB version reaches end of life. A few months after you receive
this notification, |service|:

- Stops allowing you to deploy new clusters using the end of life
  version.

- Notifies you of the version cut-off date. After the cut-off date,
  |service| upgrades your clusters to the next MongoDB version unless
  you request and receive approval for an extension.

.. example::
   When MongoDB 3.4 reaches end of life, |service|
   upgrades each of your clusters running MongoDB 3.4 to
   MongoDB 3.6.

This upgrade happens within your maintenance window if you
:ref:`configured one in your project settings <atlas-modify-project-settings>`.

In most cases, this upgrade won't cause downtime or negatively affect
your applications. You should :doc:`upgrade your cluster </tutorial/major-version-change>` before the cut-off date to ensure that your
services and applications experience no downtime or other issues due to
incompatibilities with the new MongoDB version.

To learn about potential issues for the cluster when
upgrading MongoDB versions, see ``Compatibility Changes`` in the
:manual:`MongoDB Release Notes </release-notes>` for the next MongoDB
version.

.. seealso:: To review the end of life date for each MongoDB Server
   release, see ``MongoDB Server`` in the
   :website:`MongoDB Support Policy </support-policy>`.


When does MongoDB upgrade the database version free and shared tier clusters use?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|service| upgrades free and shared tier clusters to the newest MongoDB
version after several patch versions become available for that version.
To learn more about how MongoDB versions its software, see
:manual:`MongoDB Versioning </reference/versioning>`.

Can I migrate between regions?
------------------------------

Yes. You can change one or more regions for a given cluster within the
original cloud service provider for that cluster. Using a
rolling-migration strategy for moving nodes from the original region to
a new region, MongoDB |service| preserves cluster availability.

.. admonition:: AWS Only
   :class: important

   Amazon Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering
   connections are region-specific. Clusters utilizing an existing
   |vpc| peering connection to an |aws| |vpc| in a given |aws| region
   lose access to that peering connection if moved to a different |aws|
   region. The moved cluster may use an existing peering connection in
   the new region.

   .. seealso:: :doc:`/security-vpc-peering`.

If you need to migrate data between regions on different cloud service
providers, you can:

- :doc:`Perform live migration </import/live-import>`, or

- :doc:`Migrate using mongomirror </import/mongomirror>`, or

- :doc:`Seed the destination cluster using mongorestore </import/mongorestore>`, or

- :doc:`Restore a backup from the source cluster to the destination cluster </import/mongorestore>`.

.. seealso:: :ref:`import-strategies`

Does |service| support cross-region deployments?
------------------------------------------------

Yes. You can specify additional regions for high availability or local
reads when :doc:`creating </tutorial/create-new-cluster>` or
:doc:`scaling </scale-cluster>` a deployment.

|service| *doesn't* support cross-cloud service provider deployments.

.. _faq-cross-region:

How many cross-region network permissions does |service| support?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-cross-region-limits.rst

If you would exceed the cross-region permissions limit when creating a
cluster through the |service| |api|, the |api| returns the following
error:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "error" : 403,
     "detail" : "Cannot have more than 40 cross-region network permissions.",
     "reason" : "Forbidden"
   }

.. _analytics-nodes-overview:

What are Analytics Nodes?
-------------------------

*Available on M10+ clusters.*

Analytics nodes are specialized read-only nodes used to isolate
queries which you do not want to affect your operational workload.
They are useful for handling analytic data such as reporting queries
executed by :abbr:`BI (Business Intelligence)` tools.

Analytics nodes and :ref:`read-only nodes <deploy-read-only-replicas>`
are configured with distinct
:ref:`replica set tags <replica-set-tags>` that allow you to direct
queries to desired node types and regions. For details on the
pre-defined replica set tags implemented by |service|, see
:ref:`Atlas Replica Set Tags <replica-set-tags>`.

You can have up to 50 total nodes on a multi-region cluster.
Within that :manual:`limit </reference/limits/#Number-of-Members-of-a-Replica-Set>`
there's no maximum number of analytics nodes.

Analytics nodes cannot contribute to a cluster's availability because
they cannot participate in :term:`elections <election>`, or become the
:term:`primary` for their cluster.

What AWS Regions does |service| support?
----------------------------------------

|service| supports all |aws| regions other than those in China and
`US GovCloud <https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/>`__. To learn more,
see :doc:`/reference/amazon-aws`.

.. _high-availability:

How does |service-fullname| deliver high availability?
------------------------------------------------------

|service| clusters use MongoDB's replication capability to deliver high
availability. All |service| clusters are either replica sets or sharded
clusters where each shard is a replica set. For complete documentation
on MongoDB replica sets and replication, see :manual:`Replication
</replication>`.

|service| uses a rolling upgrade strategy for executing maintenance
or infrastructure operations, such as applying security patches or
scaling up a |service| cluster. The rolling upgrade strategy ensures
that the cluster can process reads and writes for the majority of the
maintenance or infrastructure operation. During the rolling upgrade
procedure:

- |service| applies the changes to each secondary node in the cluster.
- |service| directs the primary node to step down to the secondary
  state and trigger an election of a new primary.
- Once the cluster has a new primary, |service| applies the changes to
  the former primary node.

Applications must hold write operations while the cluster elects a new
primary. The cluster can continue to process
:manual:`secondary read operations </core/read-preference>`
during this period. Elections on |service| clusters typically complete
within a few seconds. Factors such as network latency may extend the
time required for replica set elections to complete, which in turn
affects the amount of time your cluster may operate without a primary.
These factors are dependent on your particular cluster architecture.

.. include:: /includes/fact-retry-writes.rst

For ``M10+`` clusters, |service| provides a
:doc:`Test Failover </tutorial/test-failover>` feature for application
developers to check that their applications are designed to detect and
react appropriately to a replica set election. By designing
applications that can seamlessly handle a replica set election,
developers no longer have to worry about the underlying maintenance
occurring on their clusters.

|service| maintenance operations include OS patches and maintenance
patches for the MongoDB database itself (e.g. v3.6.3 to v3.6.4).
Infrastructure operations include repair operations required to replace
faulty infrastructure, and scheduled infrastructure replacements
such as changing the cluster tier.

Please :contact:`contact MongoDB Support </atlas?tck=docs_atlas>`
if you would like help architecting your application to use
|service-fullname| with optimal availability.

How can I pay for |service-fullname| without a credit card?
-----------------------------------------------------------

For alternative ways of purchasing |service|, please
:contact:`contact MongoDB Support </atlas?tck=docs_atlas>`.

Can I specify my own VPC for my |service-fullname| project?
-----------------------------------------------------------

No. An |service| project, and its clusters, are associated with a
region-specific |vpc|.

|service| creates a |vpc| when you deploy the first ``M10+`` dedicated
paid cluster to a given provider and region. For multi-region clusters,
|service| creates one |vpc| per region if there is not already a |vpc|
for that region.

*(AWS deployments only)* |service| also creates a |vpc| when you create
a :doc:`VPC peering connection </security-vpc-peering>` to an |aws|
|vpc|. |service| creates the |vpc| in the same region as the peered
|vpc|.

To use a different |vpc| (that is, on the customer's own cloud
infrastructure accounts), you would need to use |mms-full|
or Ops Manager.

|service-fullname| or |mms-full|?
---------------------------------

|service| offers a managed and simplified experience. |service| users
have access to a curated selection of configuration and infrastructure
options. The available |service| configuration and infrastructure
options may not provide the flexibility that some users require. For
example, |service| requires |tls| for cluster connectivity and does not
surface options for disabling |tls|. |service| suits users who want
fewer moving parts to manage, enabling developers and database
administrators to be more productive.

|mms-full| offers more control by exposing more configuration options
on the infrastructure of your choice. |mms| users have access to
advanced operations and a higher level of control, but must manage the
full lifecycle of their infrastructure. |mms| is best suited for users
who require a higher level of control over their MongoDB clusters.

For guidance on which MongoDB service best suits the needs of your
organization,
:contact:`contact MongoDB Support </atlas?tck=docs_atlas>`.

.. _cm-create-atlas-project:

As an existing |mms-full| account holder, how do I create a new |service-fullname| project?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When creating a new Project, |mms| offers you the choice to create a
|mms| project or |a-service| project.

To learn how to create a project, see
:ref:`Manage Projects <create-project>`.

.. _atlas-create-atlas-project:

As an existing |service| account holder, how do I create a new |service| project?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To learn how to create a project, see
:ref:`Manage Projects <create-project>`.

Can I disable TLS on my deployment?
-----------------------------------

No.

.. _how-do-i-remove-my-company-project:

How do I remove my project?
---------------------------

You can remove a project if:

- You have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role for the project.

- The project has no outstanding invoices.

- The project has no active clusters.

To delete a project for an organization, you can delete from the
organization's :guilabel:`Projects` view or the project's
:guilabel:`Project Setting` view. For details, see :ref:`delete-project`.

.. _can-i-pause-or-stop-cluster:

Can I pause or stop my |service| clusters?
------------------------------------------

You can pause an ``M10+`` paid cluster for up to 7 days at a time.
|service| automatically resumes the cluster after 7 days. For complete
documentation, see :ref:`pause-cluster`.

.. _how-do-i-modify-my-alert-settings:

How do I modify alerts?
-----------------------

To modify existing alert settings:

1. Click :guilabel:`Alerts` in the :guilabel:`Project` section of the
   left navigation.

2. Click :guilabel:`Alert Settings`.

3. Click :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` to the right of the alert you want to
   modify (edit, clone, disable, delete).

Does |service-fullname| expose the oplog?
-----------------------------------------

Yes, for ``M10`` tiers or greater.

For details on accessing your cluster's oplog, see
:ref:`ref-atlas-oplog`.

.. _can-i-deploy-more-than-24-shards:
.. _can-i-deploy-more-than-50-shards:

Can |service-fullname| deploy clusters with more than 50 shards?
----------------------------------------------------------------

While |service-fullname| out of the box allows selection of up to 50
shards, customers interested in more than 50 shards should inquire with
MongoDB. Contact |mdb-support|.

How does |service| encrypt my data?
-----------------------------------

|service| uses whole volume (disk) encryption for any data at rest,
including your cluster data and backups of that data.

|service| also requires |tls| encryption for client data and
intra-cluster network communications.

If your organization requires more specific information regarding
|service| encryption, please contact |service| |mdb-support|. From the
|service| project or cluster view, click :guilabel:`Support` in the
left-hand navigation bar.

.. _can-i-pre-split-chunks:

Can I pre-split chunks in a |service| sharded cluster?
------------------------------------------------------

The :authrole:`Atlas admin` database user role has the necessary
privileges to pre-split chunks in an empty sharded collection.

To learn more about sharded cluster chunk creation and management, see
:manual:`Create Chunks in a Sharded Cluster </tutorial/create-chunks-in-sharded-cluster>`.

Is there a maximum number of collections allowed on a single |service| cluster?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While there is no hard limit on the number of collections in a single cluster, the performance of a cluster may degrade if it serves larger numbers of collections and indexes. Larger collections have a greater impact on performance.

The recommended maximum number of collections and indexes by |service| cluster are as follows:

- :guilabel:`M10`: 5,000 collections and indexes

- :guilabel:`M20 / M30`: 10,000 collections and indexes

- :guilabel:`M40+`: 100,000 collections and indexes

Where can I view the system status of the MongoDB Cloud?
--------------------------------------------------------

Visit https://status.cloud.mongodb.com for the status of the
MongoDB Cloud, including |service| and |mms|.

You can also subscribe to an
`RSS feed <http://status.cloud.mongodb.com/rss>`_ of the MongoDB
Cloud Status page using your preferred RSS reader.

.. _faq-tls-1.0-deprecation:

What versions of TLS does |service| support?
--------------------------------------------

|service| deployments created after July 2018 support only Transport
Layer Security (TLS) protocol versions 1.1 and 1.2 by default.
|service| deployments created before July 2018 support |tls| protocol
version 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 by default. After August 2018, |service| will
support only |tls| 1.1 and 1.2 by default for all |service| clusters.

Deprecating |tls| 1.0 improves your security of
data-in-transit and aligns with industry best practices.
This is why MongoDB 4.0 requires |tls| 1.1 or later when |tls|
is enabled. As |service| requires |tls| connections for all |service|
clusters, |service| clusters running MongoDB 4.0 always use
|tls| 1.1 or later by default.

You can read more about timing and reasons for the change from the
`Payment Card Industry (PCI) <https://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/migrating-from-ssl-and-early-tls>`_
as well as the
`National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2014/04/nist-revises-guide-use-transport-layer-security-tls-networks>`_.

If you have questions about |tls| support or cannot update your
applications to support |tls| 1.1 or later by late August 2018,
please contact |service| |mdb-support|.

To open a |service| support ticket, log into the your |service|
account. Click the :guilabel:`Support` link in the |service| console
and fill in the requested details.

How do I know if my applications support TLS 1.1 or later?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|tls| 1.1 was defined in April 2006. Applications whose underlying
programming languages or security libraries predate |tls| 1.1
may require updating to a more recent version to support |tls| 1.1 or
later. You may also need to update the application host operating
system to support |tls| 1.1 or later.

MongoDB and |service| do not provide services to audit external
applications for which versions of |tls| support they support.
Third party services such as
`howsmyssl.com <https://www.howsmyssl.com/s/api.html>`_
may provide the appropriate tooling. MongoDB does not endorse the
aforementioned service, and its reference is intended only as
informational. Defer to your organization's procedures
in selecting the appropriate vendor or service for auditing
your applications to ensure |tls| 1.0 is disabled.

What do I have to do to update my clusters for TLS 1.1 or later?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| updates your existing clusters to limit |tls| support to 1.1
or later in late August 2018. The only thing you should consider doing
is auditing your applications for support of |tls| 1.1 or later and
updating any components of your technology stack that do not support
|tls| 1.1 or later.

Can I force enable TLS 1.0?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| allows users to manually enable |tls| 1.0 during
:ref:`cluster creation <create-cluster-more-configuration-options>` and
:ref:`cluster modification <scale-cluster-more-configuration-options>`.

Enabling |tls| 1.0 for any |service| cluster carries significant risks.
Consider enabling |tls| 1.0 only for as long as required to update your
application stack to support |tls| 1.1 or later.

.. _faq-storage limit:

What happens when I reach my Atlas storage limit?
-------------------------------------------------

The result of reaching your |service| storage limit depends on the
|service| cluster you are using.

- For shared clusters (``M0``, ``M2``, ``M5``), the maximum storage is
  a hard limit and cannot be exceeded. You can add additional storage
  by upgrading to a dedicated cluster (``M10+``). For details on how
  |service| calculates storage limits for shared clusters, see
  :ref:`this section <faq-caluculate-shared-storage-limit>` of the FAQ.

- By default, ``M10+`` clusters
  :ref:`auto-expand storage <scale-cluster-storage>` based on disk
  usage thresholds. To modify this setting to a fixed storage limit,
  refer to the :ref:`Modify a Cluster <scale-cluster-storage>` page.

If you attempt to write to a shared cluster that does not have space
for the desired write operation, |service| displays an error message
similar to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   WriteResult({
     "writeError": {
       "code": 8000,
       "errmsg": "you are over your space quota, using 513 MB of 512 MB"
     }
   })

.. seealso::

   To learn about the differences between shared and dedicated
   clusters, see
   :doc:`Atlas M0 (Free Tier), M2, and M5 Limitations </reference/free-shared-limitations/>`.

.. tip::

   You can configure alerts which trigger once your allocated storage
   reaches a specified threshold. |service| calculates allocated
   storage using metrics returned by the
   :manual:`dbStats() <reference/command/dbStats>` command. To learn
   more about storage alerts, see
   :ref:`DB Storage alert conditions <db-storage-alerts>`.

.. _faq-caluculate-shared-storage-limit:

How does Atlas calculate storage limits for shared clusters (M0, M2, M5)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| calculates the storage limit for shared clusters based on
data usage, as opposed to the ``storageSize`` metric used by
non-shared clusters (which includes compression). |service| determines
data usage by summing a cluster's ``dataSize`` and ``indexSize``.  You
can issue the :manual:`db.stats() </reference/method/db.stats/>`
method to view the values of these fields.

Why has |service| stopped monitoring my cluster?
------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-free-tier-monitoring-pause.rst

.. _faq-support:

How do I get support for my Atlas clusters?
-------------------------------------------

Using the in-app chat or opening a support case, :doc:`request support
</support>` through the |service| console. Support for development and
performance of the database requires an upgraded support plan. For more
information on support plans, contact |mdb-support|.

How do I delete my user account?
--------------------------------

To delete your |service| account, take the following action based on
your Support Plan:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Support Plan
     - Action

   * - Basic
     - In the lower right corner of the |service| console, click the
       chat icon to speak with a MongoDB Support representative.

   * - Developer
     - In the lower right corner of the |service| console, click the
       chat icon to speak with a MongoDB Support representative or
       :ref:`open a private support case <request-support>`.

   * - Premium
     - In the lower right corner of the |service| console, click the
       chat icon to speak with a MongoDB Support representative or
       :ref:`open a private support case <request-support>`.

.. figure:: /images/ui-chat-icon.png
   :alt: A screenshot of the chat icon in the |service| console.
   :figwidth: 600px

.. important::

   You can't reuse the email address associated with the deleted
   account to create a new |service| account.

To learn more, see :doc:`Request Support </support>`.

.. _faq-deactivate-charts:

How do I delete the |charts| instance linked to my |service| project?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-delete-charts-warning.rst

If you are a :authrole:`Project Owner`, you can deactivate and delete a
|charts| instance linked to your |service| project from your
:ref:`Project Settings <project-settings>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-recreate-charts-instance.rst

.. _faq-atlas-side-hostnames:

How do I get my Atlas-side hostnames so that I can open up my outbound firewall?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your firewall blocks outbound network connections, you must open
outbound access from your application environment to
|service-fullname|. To configure your application-side networks to
accept |service| traffic you can either use the:

- :ref:`clusters-get-all` endpoint to retrieve the ``mongoURIs`` of
  your clusters from the
  :ref:`response elements <clusters-get-all-response>`.

- :ref:`processes-get-all` endpoint to retrieve the ``hostnames`` of
  your clusters from the
  :ref:`response elements <processes-get-all-response>`.

You can parse these hostname values and pass the IP addresses
programmatically into your application-tier orchestration automation to
push firewall updates.

To find the public IP address for any node in your cluster, use the
``nslookup`` tool from the command line. The IP address is shown in
the ``Address`` portion of the output.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ nslookup ds-shard-00-00-17jcm.mongodb-dev.net

   Address: 34.226.104.79

.. _faq-public-ip-changes:

Do |service| clusters' public IPs ever change?
----------------------------------------------

.. note::

   This section applies to ``M10`` or larger clusters only unless specified.

|A-service| cluster's public IPs don't change when you:

- Scale the cluster vertically.
- Unpause the cluster.
- Change the cluster's topology.
- Terminate then re-deploy a cluster with the same name within 36
  hours.
- Experience a maintenance event on your cluster.
- Experience healing event on your cluster.

|A-service| cluster's public IP addresses must change when you:

- :ref:`Convert a replica set to a sharded cluster <scale-cluster-sharding>`.
- :ref:`Add shards to a sharded cluster <scale-cluster-shardNum>`.
- :ref:`Change the region(s) into which a cluster is deployed <scale-cluster-region>`.
- :ref:`Scale <scale-cluster-open-dialog>` an ``M0``, ``M2``, or ``M5``
  cluster to an ``M10`` or larger cluster.
- Terminate then re-deploy a cluster with the same name *but in a
  different tier* within 36 hours.

To find the public IP address for any node in your cluster, use the
``nslookup`` tool from the command line. The IP address shown are
the ``Address`` portion of the output.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ nslookup ds-shard-00-00-17jcm.mongodb-dev.net

   Address: 34.226.104.79

Why did my Atlas payment fail?
------------------------------

Payments will fail if there is an issue with your
:guilabel:`Payment Method`. To learn how to verify your
:guilabel:`Payment Method` and retry your payment, see
:ref:`retry-failed-payment`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-sca-payment-failure.rst

How can I reduce my data transfer costs?
----------------------------------------

There are a number of ways to optimize data transference depending on
the configuration of your project. For a list of common options, see
:ref:`How to Reduce Data Transfer Costs <reducing-data-transfer-costs>`
on the :guilabel:`Billing` page.

Without using Provisioned IOPS on MongoDB Atlas on AWS, what kind of IOPS should I expect?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|service| provides an estimate of how many 16K |iops| you can expect,
calculated as the lesser of 3 |iops| per provisioned GB, or the cluster
node's maximum |iops| capacity.

However, non-provisioned |iops| on |aws| can burst above this estimate
or drop below it. As a result, customers who are interested in
consistent |iops| throughput should consider leveraging
:ref:`Provisioned IOPS <storage-iops-ui>`.

Which certificate authority signs MongoDB Atlas cluster TLS certificates?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MongoDB |service| |tls| certificate changed on 25 February 2020.

MongoDB |service| moved to `Let’s Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org>`__
as the new |certauth| for |tls| certificates for all |service|
clusters.

All newly created ``M10+`` |service| clusters already utilize the new
certificates and can be used to test connectivity.

Please review the following scenarios to ensure that you will not
experience connectivity issues:

.. _tls-change-hard-code:

Hard-coded Certificate Authority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you hard-coded the DigiCert root |certauth| as the only trusted
|certauth| utilized for your application’s connection to |service|,
please ensure that you add the Let’s Encrypt root |certauth|\s to your
certificate store. Add both of the following root |certauth|\s for
`Let’s Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org>`__:

- ISRG Root X1: https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem.txt

- (IdenTrust) DST Root CA X3: https://letsencrypt.org/certs/trustid-x3-root.pem.txt

Java Users
~~~~~~~~~~

Let’s Encrypt isn't present in the default trust store for Java
version 7 prior to the 7u111 update, or Java version 8 prior to the
8u101 update. Use a Java release after 19 July 2016.

Please ensure your Java client software is up-to-date. The latest Java
versions are strongly recommended for many improvements beyond these
new |certauth| requirements for our |tls| certificates.

If you have your own trust store, add the Let’s Encrypt certificate to
it. To learn more, see :ref:`tls-change-hard-code`.

Everyone Else
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This change shouldn't impact you if you use a recent programming
language and operating system version.

.. _restore-access-google-accounts:

How do I Restore Lost Access to Organizations and Projects?
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you created your |service| account using a Gmail or Google Apps
account, the following can cause you to lose access to your
organizations and projects:

- The Google email address with which you signed up differs from the
  email address associated to your account. This is most often the case
  with Gmail or Google Apps aliases.
- Your username or email domain has changed in Google Apps.

To re-gain access to your organizations and projects:

- Ask |a-service| user with the :authrole:`Organization Owner` to
  invite you to the organization to which you lost access, or
- Contact |mdb-support|.
