.. note::

   :guilabel:`Compass Isolated Edition` restricts network
   requests to only the MongoDB server chosen on the
   :ref:`Connect <connect-run-compass>` screen. All other
   outbound connections are not permitted in this edition, meaning no
   additional firewall configuration is required when running Compass
   Isolated Edition.
