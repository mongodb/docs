MongoDB uses *write ahead logging* to an on-disk :term:`journal` to
guarantee :doc:`write operation </core/write-operations>` durability
and to provide crash resiliency. Before applying a change to the data
files, MongoDB writes the change operation to the journal. If MongoDB
should terminate or encounter an error before it can write the changes
from the journal to the data files, MongoDB can re-apply the write
operation and maintain a consistent state.

*Without* a journal, if :binary:`~bin.mongod` exits unexpectedly, you must assume
your data is in an inconsistent state, and you must run either
:doc:`repair </tutorial/recover-data-following-unexpected-shutdown>`
or, preferably, :ref:`resync <replica-set-resync-stale-member>` from a
clean member of the replica set.

With journaling enabled, if :binary:`~bin.mongod` stops unexpectedly,
the program can recover everything written to the journal, and the
data remains in a consistent state. By default, the greatest extent of lost
writes, i.e., those not made to the journal, are those made in the last
100 milliseconds. See :setting:`journalCommitInterval` for more
information on the default.

With journaling, if you want a data set to reside entirely in RAM, you
need enough RAM to hold the dataset plus the "write working set." The
"write working set" is the amount of unique data you expect to see
written between re-mappings of the private view. For information on
views, see :ref:`journaling-storage-views`.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.0
      For 64-bit builds of :binary:`~bin.mongod`, journaling is enabled by default.
      For other platforms, see :setting:`journal`.

Procedures
----------

Enable Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 2.0
   For 64-bit builds of :binary:`~bin.mongod`, journaling is enabled by default.

To enable journaling, start :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the
:option:`--journal <mongod --journal>` command line option.

If no journal files exist, when :binary:`~bin.mongod` starts, it must
preallocate new journal files. During this operation, the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` is not listening for connections until preallocation
completes: for some systems this may take a several minutes. During
this period your applications and the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell are not
available.

Disable Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Do not disable journaling on production systems. If your
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance stops without shutting down cleanly
   unexpectedly for any reason, (e.g. power failure) and you are
   not running with journaling, then you must recover from an
   unaffected :term:`replica set` member or backup, as described in
   :doc:`repair  </tutorial/recover-data-following-unexpected-shutdown>`.

To disable journaling, start :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the
:option:`--nojournal <mongod --nojournal>` command line option.

Get Commit Acknowledgment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get commit acknowledgment with the
:dbcommand:`getLastError` command and the ``j`` option. For details, see
:ref:`write-concern-operation`.

.. _journaling-avoid-preallocation-lag:

Avoid Preallocation Lag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To avoid :ref:`preallocation lag <journaling-journal-files>`, you can
preallocate files in the journal directory by copying them from another
instance of :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

Preallocated files do not contain data. It is safe to later remove them.
But if you restart :binary:`~bin.mongod` with journaling, :binary:`~bin.mongod`
will create them again.

.. example:: The following sequence preallocates journal files for an
   instance of :binary:`~bin.mongod` running on port ``27017`` with a database
   path of ``/data/db``.

   For demonstration purposes, the sequence starts by creating a set of
   journal files in the usual way.

   1. Create a temporary directory into which to create a set of journal
      files:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mkdir ~/tmpDbpath

   #. Create a set of journal files by staring a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
      instance that uses the temporary directory:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --port 10000 --dbpath ~/tmpDbpath --journal

   #. When you see the following log output, indicating :binary:`~bin.mongod` has the files,
      press CONTROL+C to stop the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

      .. code-block:: sh

         web admin interface listening on port 11000

   #. Preallocate journal files for the new instance of
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` by moving the journal files from the data directory
      of the existing instance to the data directory of the new instance:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mv ~/tmpDbpath/journal /data/db/

   #. Start the new :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db --journal

Monitor Journal Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following commands and methods to monitor journal status:

- :dbcommand:`serverStatus`

  The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns database status
  information that is useful for assessing performance.

- :dbcommand:`journalLatencyTest`

  Use :dbcommand:`journalLatencyTest` to measure how long it takes on
  your volume to write to the disk in an append-only fashion. You can
  run this command on an idle system to get a baseline sync time for
  journaling. You can also run this command on a busy system to see the
  sync time on a busy system, which may be higher if the journal
  directory is on the same volume as the data files.

  The :dbcommand:`journalLatencyTest` command also provides a way to
  check if your disk drive is buffering writes in its local cache. If
  the number is very low (i.e., less than 2 milliseconds) and the drive
  is non-SSD, the drive is probably buffering writes. In that case,
  enable cache write-through for the device in your operating system,
  unless you have a disk controller card with battery backed RAM.

.. _journaling-journal-commit-interval:

Change the Group Commit Interval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 2.0

You can set the group commit interval using the
:option:`--journalCommitInterval <mongod --journalCommitInterval>`
command line option. The allowed range is ``2`` to ``300`` milliseconds.

Lower values increase the durability of the journal at the expense of
disk performance.

Recover Data After Unexpected Shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a restart after a crash, MongoDB replays all journal files in the
journal directory before the server becomes available. If MongoDB must
replay journal files, :binary:`~bin.mongod` notes these events in the log
output.

There is no reason to run :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` in these situations.

.. _journaling-internals:

Journaling Internals
--------------------

When running with journaling, MongoDB stores and applies :doc:`write
operations </core/write-operations>` in memory and in the journal before
the changes are in the data files.

.. _journaling-journal-files:

Journal Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With journaling enabled, MongoDB creates a journal directory within
the directory defined by :setting:`dbpath`, which is :file:`/data/db`
by default. The journal directory holds journal files, which contain
write-ahead redo logs. The directory also holds a last-sequence-number
file. A clean shutdown removes all the files in the journal directory.

Journal files are append-only files and have file names prefixed with
``j._``. When a journal file holds 1 gigabyte of data, MongoDB creates
a new journal file. Once MongoDB applies all the write operations in
the journal files, it deletes these files. Unless you
write *many* bytes of data per-second, the journal directory should
contain only two or three journal files.

To limit the size of each journal file to 128 megabytes, use the
:setting:`smallfiles` run time option when starting :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

To speed the frequent sequential writes that occur to the current
journal file, you can ensure that the journal directory is on a
different system.

.. important::

   If you place the journal on a different filesystem from your data
   files you *cannot* use a filesystem snapshot to capture consistent
   backups of a :setting:`dbpath` directory.

.. note::

   Depending on your file system, you might experience a preallocation
   lag the first time you start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance with
   journaling enabled. MongoDB preallocates journal files if it is
   faster on your file system to create files of a
   pre-defined. The amount of time required to pre-allocate
   lag might last several minutes, during which you will not be able
   to connect to the database.  This is a one-time preallocation and
   does not occur with future invocations.

To avoid preallocation lag, see :ref:`journaling-avoid-preallocation-lag`.

.. _journaling-storage-views:

Storage Views used in Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Journaling adds three storage views to MongoDB.

The ``shared view`` stores modified data for upload to the MongoDB
data files. The ``shared view`` is the only view with direct access
to the MongoDB data files. When running with journaling, :binary:`~bin.mongod`
asks the operating system to map your existing on-disk data files to the
``shared view`` memory view. The operating system maps the files but
does not load them. MongoDB later loads data files to ``shared view`` as
needed.

The ``private view`` stores data for use in :doc:`read operations
</core/read-operations>`. MongoDB maps ``private view`` to the ``shared view``
and is the first place MongoDB applies new :doc:`write operations
</core/write-operations>`.

The journal is an on-disk view that stores new write operations
after MongoDB applies the operation to the ``private cache`` but
before applying them to the data files. The journal provides durability.
If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance were to crash without having applied
the writes to the data files, the journal could replay the writes to
the ``shared view`` for eventual upload to the data files.

.. _journaling-record-write-operation:

How Journaling Records Write Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB copies the write operations to the journal in batches called
group commits. See :setting:`journalCommitInterval` for more
information on the default commit interval. These "group commits" help
minimize the performance impact of journaling.

Journaling stores raw operations that allow MongoDB to reconstruct the
following:

- document insertion/updates
- index modifications
- changes to the namespace files

As :doc:`write operations </core/write-operations>` occur, MongoDB
writes the data to the ``private view`` in RAM and then copies the write
operations in batches to the journal. The journal stores the operations
on disk to ensure durability. MongoDB adds the operations as entries on
the journal's forward pointer. Each entry describes which bytes the
write operation changed in the data files.

MongoDB next applies the journal's write operations to the ``shared
view``. At this point, the ``shared view`` becomes inconsistent with the
data files.

At default intervals of 60 seconds, MongoDB asks the operating system to
flush the ``shared view`` to disk. This brings the data files up-to-date
with the latest write operations.

When MongoDB flushes write operations to the data files, MongoDB removes the
write operations from the journal's behind pointer. The behind pointer
is always far back from advanced pointer.

As part of journaling, MongoDB routinely asks the operating system to
remap the ``shared view`` to the ``private view``, for consistency.

.. note::

   The interaction between the ``shared view`` and the on-disk
   data files is similar to how MongoDB works *without*
   journaling, which is that MongoDB asks the operating system to flush
   in-memory changes back to the data files every 60 seconds.
