Definition
----------

.. note:: 

   The ``span`` operator is deprecated. Instead, use the
   :ref:`phrase <phrase-ref>`.

.. expression:: span

   The ``span`` operator finds text search matches within regions of a
   text field. You can use it to find strings which are near each other
   to specified degrees of precision. The ``span`` operator is more
   computationally intensive than other operators, because queries must
   keep track of positional information.

   ``span`` is a term-level operator, which means that the ``query``
   field is not analyzed. Term-level operators work well with the
   :ref:`Keyword Analyzer <ref-keyword-analyzer>` because the
   ``query`` field is treated as a single term, with special characters
   included.

   ``span`` queries aren't ranked by score.

.. _span-syntax:

Syntax
------

``span`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      $search: {
        "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
        "span": {
          "term" | <positional-operator>": {
            <operator-specification>
          }
        }
      }
   }

.. note::

   ``span`` search queries can't use the :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` 
   operator.

.. _span-term-ref:

Term Operator 
-------------

You can use the ``term`` operator to specify the terms to search. The
``term`` operator is required and when you use it with ``span``
:ref:`positional <span-positional-operators-ref>` operators, it must be
the innermost child of the positional operators.

Syntax 
~~~~~~

The ``term`` operator has the following syntax: 

.. code-block:: json 
   :copyable: false 

   "term": {
     "path": "<path-to-field>",
     "query": "<terms-to-search>"
   }

Fields 
~~~~~~

The ``term`` operator takes the following fields:  

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1 

   * - Option  
     - Type 
     - Required?
     - Description

   * - ``path``
     - string 
     - yes
     - Indexed field to search.

   * - ``query``
     - string 
     - yes
     - Term or phrase to search.

.. _span-positional-operators-ref:

Positional Operators  
--------------------

You can use the positional operators to specify the position of the
terms that you want to search with the :ref:`term <span-term-ref>`
operator. The positional operators are of type ``document``. You must
specify at least one positional operator in your ``span`` operator
query. The positional operators can take other ``span`` positional
operators, recursively. 

.. note:: About the Examples 

   The examples on this page use the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection.
   If you :ref:`load the sample data <sample-data>`
   and :ref:`create <ref-create-index>` a :ref:`dynamic
   <static-dynamic-mappings>` index named ``default`` on the
   :ref:`movies collection <sample-mflix>` , you can run the following
   :pipeline:`$search` sample queries against the collection. The sample
   queries use the :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the results to
   ``5`` documents and the :pipeline:`$project` stage to exclude all
   fields except the ``title`` field in the results.  

``span`` takes the following optional positional operators.

.. _span-contains:

``contains`` 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
The ``contains`` positional operator matches terms that are contained
within other terms. You can use :ref:`positional operators
<span-positional-operators-ref>` recursively or just the :ref:`term
<span-term-ref>` operator within ``contains`` to specify the search
terms.  
   
Syntax 
``````

The ``contains`` positional operator has the following syntax:  

.. code-block:: json 
   :copyable: false 
   :emphasize-lines: 4-8

   {
     "$search": {
       "span": {
         "contains": {
           "spanToReturn": "inner"|"outer",
           "little": { <positional-or-term-operator-specification> },
           "big": { <positional-or-term-operator-specification> }
         }
       }
     }
   }

     - Score to apply to the results of this search.

   * - ``spanToReturn`` 
     - string 
     - yes 
     - Type of query to execute and matching results to return. Value
       can be one of the following:  

       - ``inner`` - to execute a *within* query that matches terms from
         ``little`` that are inside of terms from ``big``
       - ``outer`` - to execute a *contains* query that matches terms
         from ``big`` that contain at least one term from ``little``

Example 
``````` 

The following example query uses ``span.contains`` to find documents in
which the term ``train`` appears with the terms ``great`` and
``robbery``, where ``great`` and ``robbery`` can be up to 5 positions
apart in the ``title`` field.

|fts| returns documents that *contain* the term ``train`` (specified
using ``little``) inside the terms ``great`` and ``robbery`` (specified 
using ``big``). If you set ``spanToReturn`` on line 6 to ``inner``, |fts|
returns the same documents because the term ``train`` (specified using
``little``) appears *within* the terms ``great`` and ``robbery``
(specified using ``big``). 

.. _span-first:

``first`` 
~~~~~~~~~

The ``first`` positional operator identifies the position of the search
term by using a specified number. You can specify the search terms using
:ref:`positional operators <span-positional-operators-ref>` recursively,
or just the :ref:`term <span-term-ref>` operator. ``span`` matches
documents where the position of the search term is less than or equal to
the specified number. 

Syntax 
``````

The ``first`` positional operator has the following syntax: 

.. code-block:: json 
   :copyable: false 
   :emphasize-lines: 4-8

   {
     "$search": {
       "span": {
         "first": {
           "endPositionLte": <term-position>,
           "operator": { <span-positional-or-term-operator-specification> },
           "score": { <score-options> }
         }
       }
     }
   }  

Fields 
``````

The ``first`` positional operator takes the following fields:

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1 

   * - Option  
     - Type 
     - Required?
     - Description

   * - ``endPositionLte``
     - int 
     - no
     - Number that specifies the position of the search term. If 
       you specify a search for multiple terms, the last term should be
       less than or equal to this value. If omitted, defaults to ``3``.

   * - ``operator``
     - document
     - yes
     - Document that contains the :ref:`positional operators
       <span-positional-operators-ref>` or :ref:`term <span-term-ref>`
       operator options.  

   * - ``score``
     - document
     - no
     - Score to apply to the results of this search.

Example 
```````

The following example queries use ``span.first`` to find documents 
in which the specified string appears in the ``title`` field. The
``endPositionLte`` parameter has a value of ``2``, which means that the  
search term specified using the ``term`` operator must be the first or
second word in the field.

      because the example includes the ``or`` operator ``clauses``
      to specify the search terms.

.. _span-near:

``near``
~~~~~~~~
   
The ``near`` positional operator matches two or more clauses that
contain the search term near each other. You can specify the search
terms using a list of :ref:`positional operators
<span-positional-operators-ref>` recursively or just the :ref:`term 
<span-term-ref>` operator. 

Syntax 
``````

The ``near`` positional operator has the following syntax:  
 
.. code-block:: json 
   :copyable: false 
   :emphasize-lines: 4-11

   {
     "$search": {
       "span": {
         "near": {
           "clauses": [
             { <span-positional-or-term-operator-specification> },
             ...
           ],
           "slop": <distance-number>,
           "inOrder": true|false
         }
       }
     }
   }  

Fields 
``````

The ``near`` positional operator takes the following fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1 

   * - Field  
     - Type 
     - Required?
     - Description

   * - ``clauses`` 
     - array of documents 
     - yes
     - Span clauses that must be near one another. Clauses can't 
       be empty. Each document contains ``span`` :ref:`positional 
       <span-positional-operators-ref>` or just the :ref:`term
       <span-term-ref>` operator options. 

   * - ``inOrder`` 
     - boolean
     - no
     - Flag that specifies whether the search for terms in the
       clauses must be in the order specified and must not be
       overlapping. 

       Value can be one of the following: 

       - ``true`` - to search for terms in the clauses in the
         specified order specified, without overlapping
       - ``false`` - to search for terms in the clauses in any order 
              
       If omitted, defaults to ``false``.

   * - ``score``
     - document
     - no
     - Score to apply to the results of this search.

   * - ``slop`` 
     - integer
     - no
     - Allowable distance between terms in the clauses. Lower
       values allow less positional distance between the terms
       and greater values allow more distance between the words
       to satisfy the query. The default is ``0``, which means that
       words in the different clauses must be adjacent to be
       considered a match.  

Example 
```````

The following example query uses ``span.near`` to search for documents in
which the strings ``prince`` and ``pauper`` are found near each other.
The ``inOrder`` parameter is set to ``false``, so the search terms can
be in any order. The ``slop`` parameter is set to ``4``, so the search
terms can be separated by up to only 4 words.

     -  array of documents
     -  yes
     -  Span clauses that specify the search terms. One of the clauses 
        must match, and clauses can't be 
        empty. Each document must contain ``span`` 
        :ref:`positional operators <span-positional-operators-ref>` specified 
        recursively or just the :ref:`term <span-term-ref>` operator options.

   * - ``score``
     - document
     - no
     - Score to apply to the results of this search.

Example 
```````

The following example query uses ``span.or`` clauses to specify two
:ref:`term <span-term-ref>` operator queries that search for documents
in which the ``title`` field has either ``city`` or ``country``. 

.. io-code-block:: 
   :copyable: true
   
   .. input:: 
      :language: javascript
      :linenos:

      db.movies.aggregate([
        {
          "$search" : {
            "span": {
              "or": {
                "clauses": [
                  { "term": { "path": "title", "query": "city" } },
                  { "term": { "path": "title", "query": "country" } }
                ],
              }
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "$limit": 5
        },
        {
          "$project": {
            "_id": 0,
            "title": 1
          }
        }
      ])

   .. output:: 
      :language: json

      [
        { title: 'Country' },
        { title: 'City Lights' },
        { title: 'King & Country' },
        { title: 'Fat City' },
        { title: 'Atlantic City' }
      ]

|fts| returns the documents that contain the search words ``city`` or 
``country`` in the ``title`` field, but not both in the same ``title``. 

.. _span-subtract:

``subtract``
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
The ``subtract`` positional operator removes matches that overlap with
another match. You can specify the search terms using a list of
:ref:`positional operators <span-positional-operators-ref>` recursively
or just the :ref:`term <span-term-ref>` operator. The ``subtract``
clause can be used to exclude certain strings from your search results.

Syntax 
``````

The ``subtract`` positional operator has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: json 
   :copyable: false 
   :emphasize-lines: 4-7

   {
     "$search": {
       "span": {
         "subtract": {
           "include": { <span-positional-or-term-operator-specification> },
           "exclude": { <span-positional-or-term-operator-specification> }
         }
       }
     }
   }  

Fields 
``````

The ``subtract`` positional operator takes the following fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1 

   * - Option  
     - Type 
     - Required?
     - Description

   * - ``exclude``
     - document 
     - yes
     - Document that specifies the term or phrase matches to remove that
       overlap with the term or phrase matches specified in the
       ``include`` field. You can specify the term or phrase
       using any span :ref:`positional operators
       <span-positional-operators-ref>` and the :ref:`term
       <span-term-ref>` operator.  

   * - ``include``
     - document 
     - yes
     - Document that specifies the term matches to include using 
       any :ref:`positional operators <span-positional-operators-ref>`
       or just the :ref:`term <span-term-ref>` operator.  

   * - ``score``
     - document
     - no
     - Score to apply to the results of this search.

Example 
```````

The following example query uses ``span.subtract`` to search for documents
in which the ``title`` field contains the words ``father`` and ``son``,
in any order, within 3 words of each other. It excludes any document in 
which the word ``like`` occurs between ``father`` and ``son``. 

.. io-code-block:: 
   :copyable: true
   
   .. input:: 
      :language: javascript
      :linenos:

      db.movies.aggregate([
        {
          "$search" : {
            "span": {
              "subtract": {
                "include": {
                  "near": {
                    "clauses": [
                      { "term": { "path": "title", "query": "father" } },
                      { "term": { "path": "title", "query": "son" } }
                    ],
                    "inOrder": false,
                    "slop": 3
                  }
                },
                "exclude": { "term": { "path": "title", "query": "like" } }
              }
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "$limit": 5
        },
        {
          "$project": {
            "_id": 0,
            "title": 1
          }
        }
      ])

   .. output:: 
      :language: json

      [
        { title: 'Father, Son & Holy Cow' },
        { title: 'My Father and My Son' },
        { title: 'Jimmy Rosenberg: The Father, the Son & the Talent' }
      ]

|fts| doesn't return the document with the title ``Like Father Like
Son`` because although the ``title`` field includes the words ``father``
and ``son``, it also has ``like`` between them, which is in the
``exclude`` criteria of the query.
