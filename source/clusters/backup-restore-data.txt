Backups are copies of your data that encapsulate the state of your
cluster at a given time. Backups provide a safety measure in the
event of data loss.

You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role for an 
|cloudgov-short| project to manage backups for or to restore a 
backup to clusters in that project.

.. tip::

   |cloudgov-short| user roles are the same as 
   :atlas:`Atlas User Roles </reference/user-roles/>`.

|aws-fr-moderate| and |aws-fr-high| backups are not compatible 
with one another. If you create a backup from a |aws-fr-high| 
region-only project, you can only restore that data to a |aws-fr-high| 
region-only project. The same is true for |aws-fr-moderate| region-only 
projects.

For a list of regions by cloud provider, see :ref:`<supported-regions>`.

See the |service| documentation to configure 
:atlas:`Cloud Backups </backup/cloud-backup/overview/>`
