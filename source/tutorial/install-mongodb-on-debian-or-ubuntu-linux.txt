Install MongoDB on Debian or Ubuntu Linux
=========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

This tutorial outlines the basic installation process for installing
:term:`MongoDB` on Ubuntu and Debian Linux systems. This tutorial uses
``.deb`` packages as the basis of the installation. 10gen publishes
packages of the MongoDB releases as ``.deb`` packages for easy
installation and management for users of Debian systems. While some of
these distributions include their own MongoDB packages, the 10gen
packages are generally more up to date.

This tutorial includes: an overview of the available packages,
instructions for configuring the package manager, the process install
packages from the 10gen repository, and preliminary MongoDB
configuration and operation.

.. seealso:: The documentation of following related processes and
   concepts.

Package Options
---------------

The 10gen repository contains two packages:

- ``mongodb-10gen``

  This package contains the latest **stable** release. Use this for
  production deployments.

- ``mongodb18-10gen``

  This package contains the previous stable release.

You cannot install these packages concurrently with each other or with
the ``mongodb`` package that your release of Debian or Ubuntu may
include.

Installing MongoDB
------------------

Configure Package Management System (APT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Debian/Ubuntu package management tool (i.e. ``dpkg`` and ``apt``)
ensure package consistency and authenticity by requring that
distributors sign packages with GPG keys. Issue the following command
to import the `10gen public GPG Key </_static/10gen-gpg-key.asc>`_ as
the root user (or with ``sudo``:)

.. code-block:: sh

   apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 7F0CEB10

Alternatively, you may use ``sudo`` to get root privileges:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 7F0CEB10

Edit the ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` file to include the 10gen
repository.

If you use an Ubuntu version with "Upstart" (i.e. any since version
9.10 "Karmic,") or are running with Upstart on Debian, use the
following line:

.. code-block:: sources.list

   deb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/ubuntu-upstart dist 10gen

If you are using Debian or Ubuntu that uses SysV style init process,
use the following line:

.. code-block:: sources.list

   deb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/debian-sysvinit dist 10gen

Now issue the following command (as root or with ``sudo``) to reload
your repository:

.. code-block:: sh

   apt-get update

Install Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the following command (as root or with ``sudo``) to install the
latest stable version of MongoDB:

.. code-block:: sh

   apt-get install mongodb-10gen

When this command completes, you have successfully installed MongoDB!
Continue for configuration and start-up suggestions.

Configure MongoDB
-----------------

These packages configure MongoDB using the ``/etc/mongodb.conf`` file
in conjunction with the :term:`control script`.  For Upstart-based
systems, find the control script is at ``/etc/init/mongodb.conf``. For
all other systems you can find the control script at
``/etc/init.d/mongodb``.

This MongoDB instance will store its data files in the
``/var/lib/mongodb`` and its log files in ``/var/log/mongodb``, and
run using the ``mongodb`` user account.

.. note::

   If you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you will need
   to modify the access control rights to the ``/var/lib/mongodb`` and
   ``/var/log/mongodb`` directories.

Controlling  MongoDB
--------------------

Starting MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upstart users can start the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo service mongodb start

All other users can issue the following command to start :program:`mongod`:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb start

You can verify that :program:`mongod` has started successfully by checking the
contents of the log file at ``/var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log``.

Stopping MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upstart users can stop the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the following
command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo service mongodb stop

All other users can issue the following command to stop :program:`mongod`:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb stop

Restarting MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upstart users can restart the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo service mongodb restart

All other users can issue the following command to restart
:program:`mongod`:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb restart

Controlling :program:`mongos`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of the current release, there are no :term:`control scripts
<control script>` for :program:`mongos`. :program:`mongos` is only
used in sharding deployments and typically do not run on the same
systems where :program:`mongod` runs. You can use the ``mongodb``
script referenced above to derive your own :program:`mongos` control
script.

Using MongoDB
-------------

Among the tools included with the MongoDB package, is the
:program:`mongo` shell. You can connect to your MongoDB instance by
issuing the following command at the system prompt:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo

This will connect to the database running on the localhost interface
by default. At the :program:`mongo` prompt, issue the following two
commands to insert a record in the "test" :term:`collection` of the
(default) "test" database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   > db.test.save( { a: 1 } )
   > db.test.find()

.. seealso:: ":program:`mongo`" and ":doc:`/reference/javascript`"
