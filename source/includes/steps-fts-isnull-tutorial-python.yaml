  The code example performs the following tasks:

  - Imports ``pymongo``, MongoDB's Python driver, and the ``dns``
    module, which is required to connect ``pymongo`` to ``Atlas`` 
    using a |dns| seed list connection string. 

  - Creates an instance of the ``MongoClient`` class to establish a 
    connection to your |service| cluster.

  - Uses the :pipeline:`$search` pipeline stage to query the collection. The query 
    uses the following :ref:`compound-ref` operator clauses:
    
    .. include:: /includes/extracts/fts-isnull-stages

  - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
    query.
