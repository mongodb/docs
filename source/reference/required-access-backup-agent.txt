Required Access for Backup Agent
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page

.. include:: /includes/legacy-agents/fact-backup-agent-deprecated.rst

If your MongoDB deployment enforces access control, the |mms| Backup
Agent must authenticate to MongoDB as a user with the proper access.

If you use :ref:`Automation <automation>`, |mms| takes care of this for you.
If you do not use Automation, follow the instructions on this page.

To authenticate, create a user with the appropriate roles in MongoDB. The
following tutorials include instructions and examples for creating the
MongoDB user:

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-cr`.

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-ldap`.

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-kerberos`.

MongoDB user roles are separate from |mms| :doc:`user roles
</reference/user-roles>`.

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/considerations-agent-access-control.rst

.. important::

   The Backup Agent user must be defined consistently for all processes
   in your |mms| deployment.

.. _access-control-backup-3.0:

MongoDB 3.0 and Later
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To backup MongoDB instances running 3.0 and later, the Backup Agent
must authenticate as a user with the following role:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Required Role
     -
   * - :authrole:`backup` role on the ``admin`` database
     -

.. _access-control-backup-2.6:

MongoDB 2.6
-----------

To backup MongoDB 2.6 release series instances, the Backup Agent must
be able to authenticate to with the following roles:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Required Role
     -
   * - :authrole:`clusterAdmin` role on the ``admin`` database
     -
   * - :authrole:`readAnyDatabase` role on the ``admin`` database
     -
   * - :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role on the ``admin`` database
     -
   * - :authrole:`readWrite` role on the ``admin`` database
     -
   * - :authrole:`readWrite` role on the ``local`` database
     -

Authentication Mechanisms
-------------------------

To authenticate, create the user in MongoDB with the appropriate
access. The authentication method that the MongoDB deployment uses
determines how to create the user as well as determine any additional
agent configuration:
