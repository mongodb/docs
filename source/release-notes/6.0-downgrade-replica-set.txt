Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/downgrade-path.rst

.. include:: /includes/downgrade/single-version-support.rst

Access Control
--------------

If your replica set has access control enabled, your downgrade user
privileges must include privileges to list and manage indexes across
databases. A user with :authrole:`root` role has the required
privileges.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin the downgrade procedure, you must complete the following
prerequisite steps.

1. Create Backup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

To learn how to create a backup, see :ref:`backup-methods`.

2. Remove Backward-Incompatible Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To downgrade from |newversion| to |oldversion|, you must remove
|newversion| features that are incompatible with |oldversion|. For a
list of incompatible features and how to remove them, see
:ref:`6.0-downgrade-considerations`.

3. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version (fCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |target| replace:: primary

To downgrade the :abbr:`fCV (feature compatibility version)` of your
replica set:

a. Ensure that no initial sync is in progress. Running the
   :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command while an initial
   sync is in progress causes the initial sync to restart.

#. Ensure that no nodes have a ``newlyAdded`` field in their
   :doc:`replica set configuration </reference/replica-configuration>`.
   Run the following command on each node in your replica set to
   verify this:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use local
      db.system.replset.find( { "members.newlyAdded" : { $exists : true } } );
   
   The ``newlyAdded`` field only appears in a node's replica set
   configuration document during and shortly after an initial sync.

#. Ensure that no replica set member is in the :replstate:`ROLLBACK` or
   :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

#. Use :binary:`mongosh` to connect to your |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/6.0-downgrade-fcv.rst

#. To ensure that all members of the replica set have the updated
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, connect to each replica set member
   and check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

   All members should return a result that includes:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "5.0" }

   If any member returns a ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of |newfcv|,
   wait for the member to return version |oldfcv| before proceeding.

For more information on the returned ``featureCompatibilityVersion``
value, see :ref:`view-fcv`.

Downgrade Procedure
-------------------

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all
   replica set members, including delayed replica set members, have the
   prerequisite changes. To do that, check the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` and the remove the incompatible
   features for each node before downgrading.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Download the latest |oldversion| binaries.

      Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the
      latest release in the |oldversion| series. If using a package
      manager, add a new repository for the |oldversion| binaries, then
      perform the actual downgrade process.

      .. include:: /includes/downgrade-path.rst

   .. step:: Replace the |newversion| binaries with the downloaded |oldversion| binaries.

      Ensure that the |oldversion| binaries are in your System PATH. To
      confirm your binary version, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: shell

         mongod --version

      The command output should indicate a 5.0-series release.

   .. step:: Downgrade secondary members of the replica set.

      Downgrade each :term:`secondary` member of the replica set, one at a
      time:

      .. procedure::
        :style: connected

        .. step:: Shut down the member.
          
           To shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process, use
           :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to connect to the secondary and run
           the following command:
              
           .. code-block:: javascript

              db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

        .. step:: Restart the member.

           To start a ``mongod`` process, run the following command:

           .. code-block:: javascript

              mongod --dbpath </path-to-data-folder>

           To learn more about starting a ``mongod`` process, see
           :ref:`start-mongod-processes`.

        .. step:: Wait for the member to enter the ``SECONDARY`` state.
          
           Before downgrading the next secondary, wait for the member
           to recover to the ``SECONDARY`` state. To check the member's
           state, use the :method:`rs.status()` method in
           :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

        .. step:: After the member is in ``SECONDARY`` stage, downgrade the next secondary.

   .. step:: Downgrade the arbiter replica set member, if any.

      Skip this step if the replica set does not include an arbiter.
  
      Downgrade the :ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiter-configuration>`
      member of the replica set:

      .. procedure::
         :style: connected

         .. step:: Shut down the member.
          
            To shutdown the arbiter, use :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to
            connect to the arbiter and run the following command:

            .. code-block:: javascript

               db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

         .. step:: Delete the contents of the arbiter data directory.
      
            To find the data directory of the arbiter
            :binary:`~bin.mongod`, check either the
            :setting:`storage.dbPath` configuration setting or
            :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` command line option.

            Run the following command:

            .. code-block:: bash

               rm -rf /path/to/mongodb/datafiles/*

         .. step:: Restart the arbiter.

            To start a ``mongod`` process, run the following command:

            .. code-block:: javascript

               mongod --dbpath </path-to-mongodb-datafiles>

            To learn more about starting a ``mongod`` process, see
            :ref:`start-mongod-processes`.

         .. step:: Wait for the member to enter the ``ARBITER`` state.
          
            Before downgrading the primary, wait for the member
            to recover to the ``ARBITER`` state. To check the member's state,
            use the :method:`rs.status()` method in :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

   .. step:: Downgrade the primary.

      .. procedure::
         :style: connected
      
         .. step:: Step down the primary.

            In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, use :method:`rs.stepDown()` to
            step down the primary and force the normal failover
            procedure.

            .. code-block:: javascript

               rs.stepDown()

         .. step:: Verify that the primary has stepped down.

            Run the following command:

            .. code-block::

               rs.status()

            Verify that the primary has stepped down and another member
            has assumed the ``PRIMARY`` state.

         .. step:: Replace and restart the former primary ``mongod``.

            .. procedure::
               :style: normal
            
               .. step:: Shut down the member.
               
                  To perform a shutdown of the primary, use
                  :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to connect to the primary and
                  run the following command:

                  .. code-block:: javascript

                     db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

               .. step:: Restart :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the |oldversion| binary.

                  To start a ``mongod`` process, run the following command:

                  .. code-block:: javascript

                     mongod --dbpath </path-to-mongodb-datafiles>

                  To learn more about starting a ``mongod`` process, see
                  :ref:`start-mongod-processes`.
