===========================================================
Enable Authentication after Creating the User Administrator
===========================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Enabling authentication on a MongoDB instance restricts access to the
instance by requiring that users identify themselves when
connecting. In this procedure, you will create the instance's first
user, which must be a user administrator and then enable
authentication. Then, you can authenticate as the user administrator
to create additional users and grant additional access to the instance.

This procedures outlines how enable authentication after creating the
user administrator. The approach requires a restart. To enable
authentication without restarting, see :doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication`.

Considerations
--------------

This document outlines a procedure for enabling
authentication for MongoDB instance where you create the first user on
an existing MongoDB system that does not require authentication before
restarting the instance and requiring authentication. You can use the
:ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>` to gain access to a
system with no users and authentication enabled. See
:doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication` for the description of that
procedure.

Next Steps
----------

If you need to disable authentication for any reason, restart the process
without the :setting:`auth` or :setting:`keyFile` option.
