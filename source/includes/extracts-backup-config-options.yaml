   Backup Configuration Options
   ----------------------------
 
   The backup and recovery requirements of a given system vary to meet the
   cost, performance and data protection standards the system's owner sets.
 
   |mms| Enterprise Backup and Recovery supports five backup architectures,
   each with its own strengths and trade-offs. Consider which architecture
   meets the data protection requirements for your deployment before
   configuring and deploying your backup architecture.
 
   .. example::
 
      Consider a system whose requirements include low operational costs. The
      system's owners may have strict limits on what they can spend on storage
      for their backup and recovery configuration. They may accept a longer
      recovery time as a result.
 
      Conversely, consider a system whose requirements include a low
      :term:`Recovery Time Objective`. The system's owners tolerate greater
      storage costs if it results in a backup and recovery configuration that
      fulfills the recovery requirements.
 
   |mms| Enterprise Backup and recovery supports the following backup
   architectures:
 
   - A File System on a Sophisticated |san|
   - A File System on one or more |nas| devices
   - An `AWS S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3>`_ :term:`Blockstore`
   - MongoDB Blockstore in a Highly Available configuration
   - MongoDB Blockstore in a Standalone configuration
 
   .. important::
 
      The backup architecture features and concerns are provided as guidance
      for developing your own data protection requirements. They do not cover
      every scenario nor are they representative of every deployment.

   .. topic:: When Do You Use a Particular Backup Method?
 
       - If you do not want to maintain separate backup systems nor do you
         want your staff to maintain them, consider backing up to a
         **MongoDB** or **S3 blockstore**.
 
       - If you need to restore data without relying on MongoDB database,
         consider backing up to a **file system on a** |san| **or** |nas|
         **device** or an **S3 blockstore**.
 
       - If you are backing up large amounts of data or frequently need to
         restore data, consider either a **file system on a** |san|, **S3
         blockstore** or a **MongoDB blockstore configured as a replica set or
         sharded cluster**.
 
       - If you want to minimize internal storage and maintenance costs,
         consider backing up to a **MongoDB standalone blockstore** or an **S3
         blockstore**.
 
       - If you have a |san| with advanced features like high availability,
         compression, de-duplication, etc., consider using that |san| **for
         file system** backups.
