   Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB removes support for the deprecated
   MongoDB Challenge-Response (``MONGODB-CR``) authentication mechanism.

   If your deployment has user credentials stored in ``MONGODB-CR``
   schema, you must upgrade to SCRAM **before** you upgrade to version
   4.0. For information on upgrading to ``SCRAM``, see
   :doc:`/release-notes/3.0-scram`.

Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) is the
default authentication mechanism for MongoDB. SCRAM is based on the
IETF `RFC 5802 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`_ standard that
defines best practices for implementation of challenge-response
mechanisms for authenticating users with passwords.

Using SCRAM, MongoDB verifies the supplied user credentials against the
user's :data:`name <admin.system.users.user>`, :data:`password
<admin.system.users.credentials>` and :data:`authentication database
<admin.system.users.db>`. The authentication database is the database
where the user was created, and together with the user's name, serves
to identify the user.

Features
--------

MongoDB's implementation of SCRAM provides:

- A tunable work factor (i.e. the iteration count),

- Per-user random salts, and

- Authentication of the server to the client as well as the client to the
  server.

SCRAM Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports the following SCRAM mechanisms:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - SCRAM Mechanism
     - Description

   * - ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` 

     - Uses the SHA-1 hashing function.

       To modify the iteration count for ``SCRAM-SHA-1``, see
       :parameter:`scramIterationCount`.

   * - ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` 

     - Uses the SHA-256 hashing function and requires
       featureCompatibilityVersion (``fcv``) set to ``4.0``.

       To modify the iteration count for ``SCRAM-SHA-256``, see
       :parameter:`scramSHA256IterationCount`.

       .. versionadded:: 4.0

When creating or updating a SCRAM user, you can indicate the specific
SCRAM mechanism as well as indicate whether the server or the client
digests the password. When using ``SCRAM-SHA-256``, MongoDB requires
server-side password hashing, i.e. the server digests the password. For
details, see :method:`db.createUser()` and :method:`db.updateUser()`.

Driver Support
--------------

To use SCRAM, you must upgrade your driver if your current driver
version does not support ``SCRAM``.

The minimum driver versions that support ``SCRAM`` are:

.. |driver-compatibility-heading| replace:: Version

.. include:: /includes/list-table-3.0-driver-compatibility.rst
