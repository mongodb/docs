specify settings such as height, width, refresh interval, and display 
theme.

You can embed only dashboards that don't require authentication 
(unauthenticated) within an iframe.

Prerequisites

- You must be a dashboard :ref:`Author <dashboard-permissions>` to 
  enable embedding for a dashboard.
- :ref:`create-new-dashboard`

After your iframe code is ready with any options you've set, you can 
place it in a web page to display your dashboard.
