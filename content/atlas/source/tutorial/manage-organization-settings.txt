Add Security Contact Information
--------------------------------

Specify a designated |service| security contact to receive security-related notifications.

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can specify only one email address to receive security-related 
  notifications including those from the MongoDB Security Team.

- We recommend that you create a mailing list that uses a single 
  address, and specify it as the security contact as a best practice. 
  A mailing list can also send these notifications to multiple users.

- Specifying a security contact does not grant them authorization or 
  access to |service| for security decisions or approvals.

- If the account for the security contact gets deleted, the 
  security contact setting is cleared, and the former security
  contact is shown as the modifier on the related notifications and 
  events.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-settings.rst

   .. step:: Specify an |service| security contact.

      a. In the :guilabel:`Atlas Security Contact Information` section, 
         click :icon-fa4:`pencil`.

      #. Specify an email address.

         Specifying a valid email address enables the :guilabel:`Save` 
         button.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

Delete an Existing Security Contact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete the currently specified security contact:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-settings.rst

   .. step:: Specify an |service| security contact.

      a. In the :guilabel:`Atlas Security Contact Information` section, 
         click :icon-fa4:`pencil`.

      #. Delete the existing email address.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.


Disable Generative AI Features
-------------------------------------

Generative AI features are enabled by default in |service|.
When this setting is turned on, :authrole:`Project Owners <Project Owner>` 
can enable or disable individual AI features at the project level. 
To learn more, see `Generative AI FAQs <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/generative-ai-faq/>`__.

To disable generative AI features for all projects in your organization:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-settings.rst
      
   .. step:: Toggle the button next to :guilabel:`Enable Atlas features that use generative AI` to :guilabel:`Off`.
      
      This disables |service| features that use generative AI across 
      all projects in the organization.

Live Migration: Connect to Atlas
--------------------------------

You connect to an organization in |service| when you
:ref:`live migrate your deployment from Cloud Manager or Ops Manager to Atlas <migrate-from-com>`.

.. _integrations:

Integrations
------------

You can configure |service| for the following integrations:

- :ref:`Slack <add-slack-to-organization>`
- :ref:`Vercel <add-vercel-pointer-only>`

.. _add-slack-to-organization:

Configure Slack Workspaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps-add-org-to-slack.rst

.. important::

   You can authorize only one Slack Workspace for each Organization.

.. _remove-slack-from-organization:

Select Organization to Remove Slack Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps-remove-org-from-slack.rst

.. important::
   This does not stop |service| from sending alerts. To stop |service|
   from sending alerts to Slack, you must :ref:`delete the Slack alert
   setting <delete-alert-setting>`.

.. _add-vercel-pointer-only:

Configure Vercel Integrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can connect your |service| {+clusters+} to applications that you
deploy using |vercel|. To learn more, see :ref:`vercel`.
