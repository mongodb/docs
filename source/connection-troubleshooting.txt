This page offers potential solutions to issues you might see when
connecting to a MongoDB instance or replica set while using the
{+driver-long+}.

.. note::

   This page lists only connection issues. If you are having any other issues
   with MongoDB, consider the following resources:

   - The :ref:`Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) <java-faq>` for the Java driver
   - The :ref:`Issues & Help <java-issues-and-help>` topic for information about
     reporting bugs, contributing to the driver, and additional resources
   - The `MongoDB Community Forums <https://community.mongodb.com>`__ for
     questions, discussions, or general technical support

Connection Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following error message is a general message indicating that the driver
cannot connect to a server on the specified hostname or port:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017

If you receive this error, try the following methods to resolve the issue.

.. _java-connection-string-port:

Check Connection String
-----------------------

Verify that the hostname and port number in the connection string are both
accurate. In the sample error message, the hostname is ``127.0.0.1`` and the
port is ``27017``. The default port value for a MongoDB instance is
``27017``, but you can configure MongoDB to communicate on another port.

.. _java-connection-firewall:

Configure Firewall
------------------

Assuming that your MongoDB deployment uses the default port, verify that your
firewall has port ``27017`` open. If your deployment is using a different port,
verify that port is open in your firewall.

.. important::

   Do not open ports in your firewall unless you are sure that is the port used
   by your MongoDB instance.

Authentication Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+driver-short+} can fail to connect to a MongoDB instance if
the authorization is not configured correctly. This often results in an error
message similar to the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Command failed with error 18 (AuthenticationFailed): 'Authentication failed.' on server localhost:27017.

If you receive this error, try the following methods to resolve the issue.

.. _java-connection-string-auth:

Check Connection String
-----------------------

An invalid connection string is the most common cause of authentication
issues when attempting to connect to MongoDB.

.. note::

   For more information about using connection strings with the Java driver,
   see :ref:`Connection URI <connection-uri>` in the Connection Guide.

If your connection string contains a username and password, ensure that they
are in the correct format.

.. note::

   If the username or password includes any of the following characters, they
   must be `percent encoded <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1>`__:

   .. code-block:: none

      : / ? # [ ] @


If your MongoDB deployment is on MongoDB Atlas, you can check your connection
string by using the :ref:`Connect to MongoDB Atlas <connect-atlas-java-driver>`
code example. Make sure to replace the connection string in the example.

When connecting to a replica set, you should include all of the hosts
in the replica set in your connection string. Separate each of the hosts
in the connection string with a comma. This enables the driver to establish a
connection if one of the hosts is unreachable.

.. _java-connection-admin:

Verify User Is in Authentication Database
-----------------------------------------

To successfully authenticate a connection by using a username and password,
the username must be defined in the authentication database. The default
authentication database is the ``admin`` database. To use a different database
for authentication, specify the ``authSource`` in the connection string. The
following example instructs the driver to use ``users`` as the authentication
database:

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: false

   MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/?authSource=users");

Error Sending Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you end a request through the driver and it is unable to send the command,
it often displays the following general error message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   com.mongodb.MongoSocketWriteException: Exception sending message

If you receive this error, try the following methods to resolve the issue.

Check Connection String
-----------------------

Verify that the connection string in
your app is accurate. This is described under :ref:`Connection Error <java-connection-string-port>`
and :ref:`Authentication Error <java-connection-string-auth>`.

Verify User Is in Authentication Database
-----------------------------------------

The user needs to be recognized in your
authentication database. This is described under :ref:`Authentication
Error <java-connection-admin>`.

Configure Firewall
------------------

The firewall needs to have an open port for communicating with the MongoDB
instance. This is described under :ref:`Connection Error <java-connection-firewall>`.

.. _java-connection-number-connections:

Check the Number of Connections
-------------------------------

Each ``MongoClient`` instance supports a maximum number of concurrent open
connections in its connection pool. The configuration parameter ``maxPoolSize``
defines this value and is set to ``100`` by default. If there are already a
number of open connections equal to ``maxPoolSize``, the server waits until
a connection becomes available. If this wait time exceeds the ``maxIdleTimeMS``
value, the driver responds with an error.

.. _java-connection-certificate:

Install Certificate
-------------------

If you are using Java version 8 or earlier, you might need to manually add a
certificate to your trust store. You can either upgrade to a later version of
the JDK or see our `Security FAQ
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/faq/security/#java-users>`__ for
information about how to add the certificate.

Timeout Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes when you send messages through the driver to the server, the messages
take a while to respond. When this happens, you might receive an error message
similar to one of the following error messages:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Timed out after 30000 ms while waiting for a server that matches ReadPreferenceServerSelector{readPreference=primary}.

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   No server chosen by ReadPreferenceServerSelector{readPreference=primary} from cluster description

If you receive one of these errors, try the following methods to resolve the
issue.

Set ``maxConnectionTimeoutMS``
------------------------------

The ``maxConnectionTimeoutMS`` option indicates the amount of time the Java
driver waits for a connection
before timing out. The default value is ``10000``. You can increase this value
or set it to ``0`` if you want the driver to never timeout.

Set ``maxConnectionLifeTime`` and ``maxConnectionIdleTime``
-----------------------------------------------------------

Consider setting ``maxConnectionLifeTime`` and
``maxConnectionIdleTime``. These parameters configure how long a connection
can be maintained with a MongoDB instance. For more information about these
parameters, see :ref:`Connection Pool Settings <mcs-connectionpool-settings>`.

Check the Number of Connections
-------------------------------

You might have too many open connections. The solution to this is described
under :ref:`Error Sending Message <java-connection-number-connections>`.

Install Certificate
-------------------

If you are using an older version of Java, you might need to manually install
some certificates as described under
:ref:`Error Sending Message <java-connection-certificate>`.

Miscellaneous Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section shows connection errors that do not fall into a broader category.
Each section lists the error message and then the specific steps you should
take to resolve it.

Monitor Thread Exception
------------------------

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   INFO: Exception in monitor thread while connecting to server ssc-cluster-01-shard-00-02.9cbnp.mongodb.net:27017

To resolve this error, you need to manually install certificates as described
under :ref:`Error Sending Message <java-connection-certificate>`.

Certificate Request Exception
-----------------------------

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: extension (5) should not be presented in certificate_request

This is a `known error <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8236039>`__
that can occur when using the TLS 1.3 protocol with specific versions of the
JDK. If you encounter this error when connecting to your MongoDB instance or
cluster, update your JDK to one of the following patch versions or newer:

- JDK 11.0.7
- JDK 13.0.3
- JDK 14.0.2

Additional Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While not related to a specific error message, this section includes
additional information that can be useful when attempting to troubleshoot
connection issues.

Get Log Information for TLS/SSL
-------------------------------

When using TLS/SSL, you can use the ``-Djavax.net.debug=all`` system property
to view additional log statements. This can help when attempting to debug any
connection issues. See `the Oracle guide to debugging TLS/SSL connections
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/ReadDebug.html>`__
for more information.
