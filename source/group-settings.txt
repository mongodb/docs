To modify group settings, click :guilabel:`Settings`, then :guilabel:`Group
Settings`.

Group settings apply to all the users in the group [#user-settings]_. The :guilabel:`Group ID`
displayed at the top of the page is used by the Atlas API.

You can set the following:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting

     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Group`

     - Sets your group's name.

       .. note:: Only the group's owner can change the group name.

   * - :guilabel:`Group Time Zone`

     - Sets your group's time zone. This does not affect the timezones set for
       individual user accounts. [#user-settings]_

   * - :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics`

     - Allows you to enable or disable the collection of database statistics
       in :doc:`cluster metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Enable Public API`

     - Allows you to access your group and its clusters through the
       :doc:`Public API </reference/api-resources>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Public Key for SCP Restores`

     - If you use |service| :doc:`Backup </backup-cluster>`, this setting
       allows you to generate a public key for SCP backup restoration. If you
       restore a snapshot through SCP, |service| uses the key to transmit the
       snapshot.

   * - :guilabel:`PagerDuty Service Key`

     - Sets a default service key for alert notifications sent to a `PagerDuty
       <http://www.pagerduty.com/?utm_source=mongodb&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partner>`_
       account. |service| enters the key by default when you add a PagerDuty
       notification to an :doc:`alert configuration </monitoring-alerts>`. If
       you add PagerDuty notifications and if the key used to send the
       notifications becomes invalid, |service| sends an email to the group
       owner and eventually removes the key.

       You can add PagerDuty notifications only for alerts that require user
       acknowledgement. Informational alerts, such as the alert that a user
       has joined a group, cannot use this notification method.

       Users can acknowledge PagerDuty alerts only from the PagerDuty
       dashboard.

   * - :guilabel:`Flowdock Settings`

     - Sets default values for alert notifications sent to Flowdock. |service|
       enters the values by default when you add a Flowdock notification to an
       :doc:`alert configuration </monitoring-alerts>`. If you add Flowdock
       notifications, and if credentials to send notifications become invalid,
       |service| sends an email to the group owner and eventually removes the
       credentials.

       Set the following:

       .. list-table::
          :widths: 20 80

          * - :guilabel:`Org Name`

            - The Flowdock organization name in lower-case
              letters. This is the name that appears after ``www.flowdock.com/app/``
              in the URL string.

          * - :guilabel:`Flow Name`

            - The flow name in lower-case letters. The flow
              name appears after the organization name in the URL string:

              ``www.flowdock.com/app/<organization-name>/<flow-name>``

          * - :guilabel:`API Token`

            - Your Flowdock "personal API token" found on
              the `<https://www.flowdock.com/account/tokens>`_ page of your
              Flowdock account.

   * - :guilabel:`HipChat Settings`

     - Sets a default room and API token for alert notifications sent to a
       HipChat account. |service| enters the values by default when you add a
       HipChat notification to an :doc:`alert configuration
       </monitoring-alerts>`. If you add HipChat notifications and the token
       used to send notifications becomes invalid, |service| sends an email to
       the group owner and eventually removes the token.


   * - :guilabel:`Slack Settings`

     - Sets a default channel and token for alert notifications sent to a
       Slack account. You can use either an API token or a Bot token. To
       create an API token, see the `<https://api.slack.com/web>`_ page in
       your Slack account. For information on Bot users in Slack, see
       `<https://api.slack.com/bot-users>`_.

       |service| enters these values by default when you add a Slack
       notification to an :doc:`alert configuration </monitoring-alerts>`. If
       add Slack notifications and the token used to send notifications
       becomes invalid, |service| sends an email to the group owner and
       eventually removes the token.

   * - :guilabel:`Webhook Settings`

     - Adds a :guilabel:`Webhook URL` endpoint to which |service| can send
       alert notifications for programmatic processing. |service| sends an
       alert notification as an HTTP POST request. The request body
       contains a JSON document that uses the same format as the Public API's
       ``Alerts`` resource.

       |service| adds a request header called ``X-MMS-Event`` to distinguish
       between various alert states. The possible values for this header are:

       .. list-table::
          :widths: 30 70

          * - ``alert.open``

            - The alert was just opened.

          * - ``alert.close``

            - The alert was resolved.

          * - ``alert.update``

            - A previously opened alert is still open.

          * - ``alert.acknowledge``

            - The alert was acknowledged.

          * - ``alert.cancel``

            - The alert became invalid and was canceled.

          * - ``alert.inform``

            - Represents an informational alert, which is a
              point-in-time event, such as "Primary Elected."

       If you specify a key in the :guilabel:`Webhook Secret` field, |service|
       adds the ``X-MMS-Signature`` request header, which contains the
       hex-encoded HMAC signature of the request body. The signature is
       created using the provided secret.

       To send alert notifications to a Webhook, select the Webhook
       notification option when creating or editing an :doc:`alert
       </monitoring-alerts>`. If you add a Webhook notification and the URL or
       optional key becomes invalid, |service| sends an email to the group
       owner and eventually removes the Webhook settings.

   * - :guilabel:`New Relic Settings`

     - Configures |service| to send metric data about your deployment to `New
       Relic <http://newrelic.com/>`_ for viewing through the New Relic
       MongoDB plugin. You can also use Insights for New Relic to run
       analytics on the collected data. |service| sends New Relic the same
       metric data as displayed in |service| :doc:`cluster metrics
       </monitor-cluster-metrics>`.

       Enter the following information from your New Relic account. If you do
       not have an existing New Relic account, you can sign up using
       `<http://newrelic.com/mongodb>`_.

       - Account ID
       - License Key
       - Insights API Insert Key
       - Insights API Query Key

       If any of the keys later become invalid, |service| sends an email to
       the group owner and eventually removes the invalid credentials.

.. [#user-settings]
   To modify your user settings, click on your user name in the
   upper-right hand corner and select :guilabel:`Account`.
