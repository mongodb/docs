Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to skip a specified number of returned
results from read operations with the MongoDB Kotlin driver.

You can skip results on the returned results of a query by using the
``skip()`` method. You can also skip documents at a specific stage in an
aggregation pipeline by specifying a ``$skip`` aggregation stage.

The ``skip()`` method takes an integer that specifies the number of documents
to omit from the beginning of the list of documents returned by the
`FindFlow <{+driver-api+}/-find-flow/index.html>`__. 

You can use the ``skip()`` method to skip the first two documents as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/SkipTest.snippet.basic-skip.kt
   :language: kotlin 

`Aggregates.skip() <{+core-api+}/client/model/Aggregates.html#skip(int)>`__
is an optional stage in the aggregation pipeline that specifies how many
documents to omit from the beginning of the results of the prior stage. 

You can use the ``Aggregates.skip()`` method to skip the first two documents as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/SkipTest.snippet.aggregates-skip.kt
   :language: kotlin

Examples
--------

The following example is about a paint store that sells eight different
colors of paint.  The best colors sell quicker than the other colors.
One day, a customer asks what the three best-selling (lowest inventory)
colors are. The paint store keeps track of inventory in the ``qty``
field in their ``paint_inventory`` collection: 

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": 1, "color": "red", "qty": 5 }
   { "_id": 2, "color": "purple", "qty": 10 }
   { "_id": 3, "color": "blue", "qty": 9 }
   { "_id": 4, "color": "white", "qty": 6 }
   { "_id": 5, "color": "yellow", "qty": 11 }
   { "_id": 6, "color": "pink", "qty": 3 }
   { "_id": 7, "color": "green", "qty": 8 }
   { "_id": 8, "color": "orange", "qty": 7 }

This data is modeled with the following Kotlin data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/SkipTest.snippet.skip-data-model.kt
   :language: kotlin

To address the scenario, the paint store needs to query the
``paint_inventory`` collection with an empty filter, sort the documents
by ``qty`` field and omit the first five results.

Using a FindIterable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/SkipTest.snippet.find-iterable.kt
      :language: kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

      PaintOrder(id=4, qty=6, color=white)
      PaintOrder(id=1, qty=5, color=red)
      PaintOrder(id=6, qty=3, color=pink)

- The ``find()`` method returns all documents.  
- The ``sort()`` method specifies documents to display from highest to lowest based on the ``qty`` field.
- The ``skip()`` method specifies to omit the first five documents. 

Using Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/SkipTest.snippet.aggregation.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

      PaintOrder(id=4, qty=6, color=white)
      PaintOrder(id=1, qty=5, color=red)
      PaintOrder(id=6, qty=3, color=pink)

- The ``match()`` stage returns all documents.  
- The ``sort()`` stage specifies documents to display from highest to lowest based on the ``qty`` field.
- The ``skip()`` stage specifies to omit the first five documents. 

After the paint store runs the query, they find the three best-selling colors are pink,
red, and white. 

.. note::

   If the value of skip is greater than or equal to the number of matched
   documents for a query, that query returns no documents.

   If the ``skip()`` method from the preceding example skips the first nine
   documents, no results would return since the specified quantity
   exceeds the number of matched documents. 

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/SkipTest.snippet.no-results.kt
      :language: kotlin
