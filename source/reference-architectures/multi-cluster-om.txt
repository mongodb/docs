The Ops Manager is responsible for facilitating workloads such as backing up 
data, monitoring database performance and more. To make your multi-cluster Ops 
Manager and the Application Database deployment resilient to entire data center 
or zone failures, deploy the Ops Manager Application and the Application 
Database on multiple Kubernetes clusters.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin the following procedure, perform the following actions:

- Install ``kubectl``.
- Complete the :ref:`GKE Clusters procedure <reference-architectures-gke-clusters>` or the equivalent.
- Complete the :ref:`TLS Certificates procedure <reference-architectures-ca-certs>` or the equivalent.
- Complete the :ref:`Istio Service mesh procedure <reference-architectures-istio-service-mesh>` or the equivalent.
- Complete the :ref:`Deploy the MongoDB Operator <reference-architectures-deploy-operator>` procedure.
- Set the required environment variables as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/env_variables.sh
   :language: bash
   :copyable: true

Source Code
-----------

You can find all included source code in the `MongoDB Kubernetes Operator repository <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/tree/${current_branch}/architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster>`__.

Procedure
----------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Generate TLS certificates.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/code_snippets/0250_generate_certs.sh
         :language: bash

   .. step:: Install |onprem|.

      At this point, you have prepared the environment and the |k8s-op-short|
      to deploy the |onprem| resource.

      a. Create the necessary credentials for the |onprem| admin user that the
         |k8s-op-short| will create after deploying the |application| instance:

         .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/code_snippets/0300_ops_manager_create_admin_credentials.sh
            :language: bash
            :linenos:

      b. Deploy the simplest ``MongoDBOpsManager`` custom resource possible
         (with |tls| enabled) on a single member cluster, which is also known as
         the operator cluster.

         This deployment is almost the same as the deployment for the :ref:`single-cluster mode <mode-multi-or-single>`,
         but with :opsmgrkube:`spec.topology` and :opsmgrkube:`spec.applicationDatabase.topology`
         set to ``MultiCluster``.

         Deploying this way shows that a single |k8s| cluster deployment is
         a special case of a multi-|k8s| cluster deployment on a single |k8s| member cluster.
         You can start deploying the |application| and the {+appdb+}
         on as many |k8s| clusters as necessary from the beginning, and don't
         have to start with the deployment with only a single member |k8s| cluster.

         At this point, you have prepared the |onprem| deployment to span more
         than one |k8s| cluster, which you will do later in this procedure.

         .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/code_snippets/0310_ops_manager_deploy_on_single_member_cluster.sh
            :language: bash
            :linenos:

      c. Wait for the |k8s-op-short| to pick up the work and reach the
         ``status.applicationDatabase.phase=Pending`` state. Wait for both the
         {+appdb+} and |onprem| deployments to complete.

         .. io-code-block::
            :copyable: true

            .. input:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/code_snippets/0311_ops_manager_wait_for_pending_state.sh
               :linenos:
               :language: bash

            .. output:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/output/0311_ops_manager_wait_for_pending_state.out
               :linenos:
               :language: bash
               :visible: false

      d. Deploy |onprem|. The |k8s-op-short| deploys |onprem| by performing
         the following steps. It:

         - Deploys the {+appdb+}\'s replica set nodes and waits
           for the MongoDB processes in the replica set to start running.
         - Deploys the |application| instance with the {+appdb+}\'s
           connection string and waits for it to become ready.
         - Adds the Monitoring {+mdbagent+} containers to each {+appdb+}\'s Pod.
         - Waits for both the |application| and the {+appdb+} Pods to start running.

         .. io-code-block::
            :copyable: true

            .. input:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/code_snippets/0312_ops_manager_wait_for_running_state.sh
               :linenos:
               :language: bash

            .. output:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/output/0312_ops_manager_wait_for_running_state.out
               :linenos:
               :language: bash
               :visible: false

         Now that you have deployed a single-member cluster in a :ref:`multi-cluster mode <mode-multi-or-single>`,
         you can reconfigure this deployment to span more than one |k8s| cluster.

      e. On the second member cluster, deploy two additional {+appdb+}
         replica set members and one additional instance of the |application|:

         .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/code_snippets/0320_ops_manager_add_second_cluster.sh
            :language: bash
            :linenos:

      f. Wait for the |k8s-op-short| to pick up the work (pending phase):

         .. io-code-block::
            :copyable: true

            .. input:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/code_snippets/0321_ops_manager_wait_for_pending_state.sh
               :linenos:
               :language: bash

            .. output:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/output/0321_ops_manager_wait_for_pending_state.out
               :linenos:
               :language: bash
               :visible: false

      g. Wait for the |k8s-op-short| to finish deploying all components:

         .. io-code-block::
            :copyable: true 

            .. input:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/code_snippets/0322_ops_manager_wait_for_running_state.sh
               :linenos:
               :language: bash

            .. output:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/output/0322_ops_manager_wait_for_running_state.out
               :linenos:
               :language: bash
               :visible: false

   .. step:: Enable backup.

      In a multi-|k8s| cluster deployment of the |application|, you can configure
      only |s3|-based backup storage. This procedure refers to ``S3_*``
      defined in :ref:`env_variables.sh <set-env-vars-om-mc>`.

      a. Optional. Install the |minio|.

         This procedure deploys |s3|-compatible storage for your backups using the |minio|.
         You can skip this step if you have |aws| |s3| or other |s3|-compatible
         buckets available. Adjust the ``S3_*`` variables accordingly in
         :ref:`env_variables.sh <set-env-vars-om-mc>` in this case.

         .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/code_snippets/0400_install_minio_s3.sh
            :language: bash
            :linenos:

      b. Before you configure and enable backup, create secrets:

         - ``s3-access-secret`` - contains |s3| credentials.
         - ``s3-ca-cert`` - contains a |certauth| certificate that issued the bucket's
           server certificate. In the case of the sample MinIO deployment used
           in this procedure, the default |k8s| Root |certauth| certificate
           is used to sign the certificate. Because it's not a publicly trusted
           |certauth| certificate, you must provide it so that |onprem| can
           trust the connection.

         If you use publicly trusted certificates, you may skip this step and
         remove the values from the :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3Stores.customCertificateSecretRefs`
         and :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.s3OpLogStores.customCertificateSecretRefs` settings.

         .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/code_snippets/0500_ops_manager_prepare_s3_backup_secrets.sh
            :language: bash
            :linenos:

   .. step:: Re-deploy |onprem| with backup enabled.

      a. The |k8s-op-short| can configure and deploy all components,
         the |application|, the Backup Daemon instances, and the Application
         Database's replica set nodes in any combination on any member clusters
         for which you configure the |k8s-op-short|.
   
         To illustrate the flexibility of the multi-|k8s| cluster deployment
         configuration, deploy only one Backup Daemon instance on the third
         member cluster and specify zero Backup Daemon members for the first
         and second clusters.

         .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/code_snippets/0510_ops_manager_enable_s3_backup.sh
            :language: bash
            :linenos:

      b. Wait until the |k8s-op-short| finishes its configuration:

         .. io-code-block:: 
            :copyable: true 

            .. input:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/code_snippets/0522_ops_manager_wait_for_running_state.sh
               :linenos:
               :language: bash

            .. output:: /includes/code-examples/reference-architectures/ops-manager-multi-cluster/output/0522_ops_manager_wait_for_running_state.out
               :linenos:
               :visible: false

   .. step:: Create credentials for the Kubernetes Operator.

      To configure credentials, you must create an |onprem| organization,
      generate programmatic API keys in the |onprem| UI, and create a |k8s-secret| 
      with your Load Balancer IP. See :ref:`create-k8s-credentials` to learn more.
