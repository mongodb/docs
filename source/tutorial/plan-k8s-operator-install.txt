Use the |k8s-op-full| to deploy:

- Ops Manager resources
- MongoDB standalone, replica set, and sharded cluster resources

To deploy MongoDB resources with the |k8s-op-short|, you need an
|onprem| instance. Deploy this instance to |k8s| using the Operator or
outside |k8s| using
:opsmgr:`traditional installation methods </installation>`. The
Operator uses |onprem| |api| methods to deploy then manage MongoDB
resources.
