Definition
----------

.. method:: sh.splitAt(namespace, query)

   Splits a chunk at the shard key value specified by the query.

   The method takes the following arguments:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-sh.splitAt-param.rst

Consideration
-------------

.. |split-method| replace:: :method:`sh.splitAt()`

.. include:: /includes/fact-split-methods.rst

Behavior
--------

:method:`sh.splitAt()` splits the original chunk into two chunks. One
chunk has a shard key range that starts with the original lower bound
(inclusive) and ends at the specified shard key value (exclusive). The
other chunk has a shard key range that starts with the specified shard
key value (inclusive) as the lower bound and ends at the original upper
bound (exclusive).

To split a chunk at its median point instead, see
:method:`sh.splitFind()`.
