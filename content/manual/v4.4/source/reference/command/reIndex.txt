.. dbcommand:: reIndex

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`db.collection.reIndex` helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

   The :dbcommand:`reIndex` command drops all indexes on a
   collection and recreates them. This operation may be expensive for
   collections that have a large amount of data and/or a large number
   of indexes. 

   .. warning::

      - For most users, the :dbcommand:`reIndex` command is unnecessary.

      - Avoid running :dbcommand:`reIndex` for a replica set.

      - Do not run :dbcommand:`reIndex` against a collection in a
        sharded cluster.

        .. versionchanged:: 4.2

           MongoDB disallows :dbcommand:`reIndex` to be run on a
           :binary:`~bin.mongos`, implementing a stronger restriction
           against running :dbcommand:`reIndex` for a collection in a
           sharded cluster.

   Use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { reIndex: <collection> }

   The command takes the following fields:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 80
    
      * - Field
        - Description
    
      * - reIndex
        - The name of the collection to reindex.

Resource Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 4.2.2

For MongoDB 4.2.2 and later, :dbcommand:`reIndex` obtains an exclusive
(W) lock on the collection and blocks other operations on the collection
until it completes.

For MongoDB 4.0.0 through 4.2.1, :dbcommand:`reIndex` obtains a global
exclusive (W) lock and blocks other operations on the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` until it completes.

For MongoDB 3.6 and earlier, :dbcommand:`reIndex`
obtains an exclusive (W) lock on the database and blocks other 
operations on the database until finished.

For more information on locking in MongoDB, see :doc:`/faq/concurrency`.

.. see::

   :doc:`/core/index-creation` for more information on the
   behavior of indexing operations in MongoDB.
