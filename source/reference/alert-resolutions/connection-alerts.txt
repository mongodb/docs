:ref:`Connection alerts <alert-conditions-connections>` typically
occur when the maximum number of allowable connections to a MongoDB
process has been exceeded. Once the limit is exceeded, no new
connections can be opened until the number of open connections drops
down below the limit.

Alert Conditions
----------------

You can configure the following alert conditions in the project-level 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>` page to trigger alerts.

:alert:`Connections <Connections is>` occurs if the number of active 
connections to the host meets the specified average.

:alert:`Connections % of configured limit 
<Connections % of configured limit is>` occurs if the number of open 
connections to the host exceeds the specified percentage.

Common Triggers
---------------

Exceeding the connection limit for an |service| cluster may occur for
a number of reasons. Different |service| tiers have different
:ref:`connection limits <connection-limits>`; clusters of size
``M0/M2/M5``, for example, are limited to 500 connections, and clusters
of size ``M10`` are limited to 1500 connections. Larger cluster tiers
have higher connection limits. Different database
access applications have different ways of implementing
:manual:`connection pooling
</reference/connection-string/#connection-pool-options>`,
which affects how many open connections your application maintains at
any given time.

Fix the Immediate Problem
-------------------------

.. _connection-alert-m0:

M0/M2/M5 Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To resolve a :ref:`connection alert <alert-conditions-connections>`
condition, restart the application which is currently making
connections to your |service| cluster. Restarting the application
terminates all existing connections opened by the application
and allows the |service| cluster to resume normal operations.

M10+ Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

|service| clusters of size ``M10`` and greater can utilize the
:doc:`Test Primary Failover </tutorial/test-resilience/test-primary-failover>`
option. The Test Primary Failover procedure steps down the current
:manual:`primary node </core/replica-set-primary>` and triggers an
:manual:`election </core/replica-set-elections>`, which drops all
connections to the primary node.

.. note::

   If your application connects exclusively to a secondary node,
   you may need to perform the Test Failover procedure several times
   to make sure the applicable secondary node rotates its position
   within the replica set and drops its connections.

Test Failover is usually the preferable solution, but another
possible solution is to restart the application currently making
connections to your |service| cluster. Restarting the application
terminates all existing connections and allows the |service| cluster
to resume normal operations. 

Implement a Long-Term Solution
------------------------------

Connection alerts are generally a symptom of a larger problem.
Employing one of the strategies outlined above will fix the immediate
problem, but a permanent solution usually requires either:

- Examining your database applications for flawed connection code.
  Situations in which connections are opened but never closed can allow
  old connections to pile up and eventually exceed the connection
  limit. Additionally, you may need to implement some form of
  :manual:`connection pooling
  </reference/connection-string/#connection-pool-options>`. 

- Upgrading to a larger |service| :ref:`cluster tier
  <instance-size-costs>` which allows a greater number of connections,
  if your user base is too large for your current cluster tier.

Monitor Your Progress

View the :guilabel:`Connections` chart to monitor the total number of 
connections to the cluster.
