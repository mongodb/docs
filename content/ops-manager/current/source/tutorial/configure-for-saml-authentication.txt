You can use an Identity Provider (|idp|) that runs the Security
Assertion Markup Language (|saml|) service to manage |mms| user
authentication and authorization. When you try to navigate to |mms|
without an authenticated session, |mms| sends you to the |idp| where
you log in. After you authenticate, you return to the |application|.

This tutorial describes how to:

* Configure |saml| authentication for |mms|

* Map |saml| groups to |mms| :ref:`organization-roles` and
  :ref:`project-roles`.

Considerations
--------------

Users Remain Authenticated after |saml| Activation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you change your |mms| instance to use |saml| authentication, all
users remain logged in to the current session. After the authentication
change, users who try to log into |mms| are redirected to the |saml|
|idp|.

Two-Stage Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some circular logic applies when setting up a |saml| instance. To
create a working integration:

- The |idp| needs values from the Service Provider and
- The Service Provider needs values from the |idp|.

To start this integration, follow the Prerequisites, then the Procedure
in this tutorial.

Prerequisites
-------------

To configure |saml| integration, you must perform the following actions
for your |saml| |idp|:

1. Install your |saml| |idp|.

#. Verify that your |mms| instance can access your |idp| over the
   network.

#. In the |saml| |idp|, you must:

   a. Create a |saml| user that maps to your |mms| Global Owner.

   #. Create a |saml| group that you can map to your |mms|
      :guilabel:`Global Owner`.

   #. Assign the :guilabel:`Global Owner` |saml| group to your |saml|
      user.

   #. Create a new application for |onprem| representing |onprem|.

   #. Configure initial |onprem| |saml| values for this new
      application:

      i. Set placeholder values for the following fields:

         - :guilabel:`SP Entity ID or Issuer`
         - :guilabel:`Audience URI`
         - :guilabel:`Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL`

      #. Set real values for the following fields in your |idp|:

         .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1
            :stub-columns: 1
            :widths: 40 60

            * - Field
              - Common Value

            * - :guilabel:`Signature Algorithm`
              - Your |idp| might have one or more of the following
                values:

                - ``rsa-sha1``
                - ``dsa-sha1``
                - ``rsa-sha256``
                - ``rsa-sha384``
                - ``rsa-sha512``

            * - :guilabel:`Name ID`
              - ``Email Address``

            * - :guilabel:`Name ID Format`
              - ``urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified``

      #. Create attributes with Attribute Names for the following
         Attribute Values:

         - Email Address
         - First Name
         - Last Name
         - User Groups

      #. Configure your |idp| to require signed SAML Responses and 
         Assertions.

      #. Save these values.
