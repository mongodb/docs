A :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` is a group of MongoDB deployments that maintain 
the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high 
availability and are the basis for all production deployments. 

To learn more about replica sets, see the :manual:`Replication
Introduction </core/replication-introduction>` in the MongoDB manual.

Use this procedure to deploy a new replica set managed by |mms|. After
deployment, use |mms| to manage the replica set, including such 
operations as adding, removing, and reconfiguring members.
