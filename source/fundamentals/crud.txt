CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations enable you to work with
data stored in MongoDB.

- :ref:`golang-crud-read-operations` find and return
  documents stored in your database.
- :ref:`golang-crud-write-operations` insert, modify,
  or delete documents in your database.

Some operations combine aspects of read and write operations. To learn
more about these hybrid methods, see :ref:`golang-compound-operations`.

To run a raw database operation, see :ref:`golang-run-command`.

To learn about how to modify the way your CRUD operations execute, see :ref:`golang-write-read-pref`.
