Overview
--------

:term:`Capped collections <capped collection>` are fixed-size
collections that support high-throughput operations that insert
and retrieve documents based on insertion order. Capped
collections work in a way similar to circular buffers: once a
collection fills its allocated space, it makes room for new documents
by overwriting the oldest documents in the collection.

See :method:`~db.createCollection()` or :dbcommand:`create`
for more information on creating capped collections.

.. tip::

   As an alternative to capped collections, consider MongoDB's
   :ref:`TTL (Time To Live) indexes <index-feature-ttl>`. As
   described in :ref:`ttl-collections`, these indexes allow you
   to expire and remove data from normal collections based on the value
   of a date-typed field and a TTL value for the index.

   TTL indexes are not compatible with capped collections.


Behavior
--------

Insertion Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Capped collections guarantee preservation of the insertion order. As a
result, queries do not need an index to return documents in insertion
order. Without this indexing overhead, capped collections can support
higher insertion throughput.

.. _capped_collections_remove_documents:

Automatic Removal of Oldest Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make room for new documents, capped collections automatically remove
the oldest documents in the collection without requiring scripts or
explicit remove operations.

Consider the following potential use cases for capped
collections:

- Store log information generated by high-volume systems. Inserting
  documents in a capped collection without an index is close to the
  speed of writing log information directly to a file
  system. Furthermore, the built-in *first-in-first-out* property
  maintains the order of events, while managing storage use.

- Cache small amounts of data in a capped collections. Since caches
  are read rather than write heavy, you would either need to ensure
  that this collection *always* remains in the working set (i.e. in
  RAM) *or* accept some write penalty for the required index or
  indexes.

For example, the :term:`oplog.rs <oplog>` collection that stores a log
of the operations in a :term:`replica set` uses a capped collection.
Starting in MongoDB 4.0, unlike other capped collections, the oplog can
grow past its configured size limit to avoid deleting the :data:`majority
commit point <replSetGetStatus.optimes.lastCommittedOpTime>`.

``_id`` Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Capped collections have an ``_id`` field and an index on the ``_id``
field by default.

Restrictions and Recommendations
--------------------------------

Reads
~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-capped-collection-read-change.rst

Updates
~~~~~~~

If you plan to update documents in a capped collection, create an index
so that these update operations do not require a collection scan.

Sharding
~~~~~~~~

You cannot shard a capped collection.

Query Efficiency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use natural ordering to retrieve the most recently inserted elements
from the collection efficiently. This is similar to using the ``tail``
command on a log file.

Aggregation ``$out``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aggregation pipeline stage :pipeline:`$out` 
cannot write results to a capped collection.

Stable API
~~~~~~~~~~

Capped collections are not supported in :ref:`Stable API
<stable-api>` V1.

Procedures
----------

Create a Capped Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must create capped collections explicitly using the
:method:`db.createCollection()` method, which is a
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` helper for the :dbcommand:`create` command.
When creating a capped collection you must specify the maximum size of
the collection in bytes, which MongoDB will pre-allocate for the
collection. The size of the capped collection includes a small amount of
space for internal overhead.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection( "log", { capped: true, size: 100000 } )

MongoDB increases the provided ``size`` to make it an integer multiple 
of 256.

Additionally, you may also specify a maximum number of documents for the
collection using the ``max`` field as in the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection("log", { capped : true, size : 5242880, max :
   5000 } )

.. important:: The ``size`` argument is *always* required, even when
   you specify the ``max`` number of documents. MongoDB removes older
   documents if a collection reaches the maximum size limit before it
   reaches the maximum document count.

.. see::

   :method:`db.createCollection()` and  :dbcommand:`create`.

.. _capped-collections-options:

Query a Capped Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you perform a :method:`~db.collection.find()` on a capped collection
with no ordering specified, MongoDB guarantees that the ordering of
results is the same as the insertion order.

To retrieve documents in reverse insertion order, issue
:method:`~db.collection.find()` along with the :method:`~cursor.sort()`
method with the :operator:`$natural` parameter set to ``-1``, as shown
in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.cappedCollection.find().sort( { $natural: -1 } )

Check if a Collection is Capped
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :method:`~db.collection.isCapped()` method to determine if a
collection is capped, as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.isCapped()

Convert a Collection to Capped
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can convert a non-capped collection to a capped collection with
the :dbcommand:`convertToCapped` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand({"convertToCapped": "mycoll", size: 100000});

The ``size`` parameter specifies the size of the capped collection in
bytes.

.. include:: /includes/fact-database-lock.rst

Change a Capped Collection's Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 6.0

You can resize a capped collection using the :dbcommand:`collMod` command's 
``cappedSize`` option to set the ``cappedSize`` in bytes. ``cappedSize`` must be 
greater than ``0`` and less than ``1e+15`` (1 PB). 

.. note::

   Before you can resize a capped collection, you must have already set
   the :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <set-fcv>` to at least version
   ``"6.0"``.

For example, the following command sets the maximum size of the ``"log"`` capped 
collection to 100000 bytes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { collMod: "log", cappedSize: 100000 } )

Change the Maximum Number of Documents in a Capped Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 6.0

To change the maximum number of documents in a capped collection, use the
:dbcommand:`collMod` command's ``cappedMax`` option. If ``cappedMax`` is less 
than or equal to ``0``, there is no maximum document limit. If
``cappedMax`` is less than the current number of documents in the
collection, MongoDB removes the excess documents on the next insert operation.

For example, the following command sets the maximum number of documents in the
``"log"`` capped collection to 500:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { collMod: "log", cappedMax: 500 } )

Tailable Cursor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use a :term:`tailable cursor` with capped collections. Similar to the
Unix ``tail -f`` command, the tailable cursor "tails" the end of a
capped collection. As new documents are inserted into the capped
collection, you can use the tailable cursor to continue retrieving
documents.

See :doc:`/core/tailable-cursors` for information on creating
a tailable cursor.
