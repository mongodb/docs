==================
Connect to MongoDB
==================

.. facet::

.. meta::
   :keywords: test connection, runnable, code example

After retrieving the connection string for your MongoDB Atlas deployment,
you can connect to the deployment from your Scala application and query
the Atlas sample datasets.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create an application file

      Navigate to the ``scala-quickstart`` directory that you made in the
      :ref:`scala-quick-start-download-and-install` step of this guide and
      create the ``src/main/scala/quickstart`` nested directories.

      Select the tab corresponding to your operating system and run the following
      commands to create a ``Main.scala`` file in the ``quickstart`` subdirectory:

      .. tabs::

          .. tab:: macOS / Linux
             :tabid: create-file-mac-linux

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd src/main/scala/quickstart
                touch Main.scala

          .. tab:: Windows
             :tabid: create-file-windows

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd src/main/scala/quickstart
                type nul > Main.scala

   .. step:: Add helper methods

      Add the following ``Helpers.scala`` file from the `driver source code
      <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/blob/main/driver-scala/src/integration/scala/tour/Helpers.scala>`__
      to the ``src/main/scala/quickstart`` directory:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/Helpers.scala
         :language: scala

      This file allows you to access helper methods for printing query results.

   .. step:: Add your application code

      Copy and paste the following code into the ``Main.scala`` file, which queries
      the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/Main.scala
         :language: scala

   .. step:: Assign the connection string

      Replace the ``<connection string>`` placeholder with the 
      connection string that you copied from the :ref:`scala-connection-string`
      step of this guide.

   .. step:: Run your Scala application

      In your project root directory, run the following commands to start the sbt shell
      and run your application:
      
      .. code-block:: bash

         sbt
         run

      The command line output contains details about the retrieved movie
      document:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         {"_id": {"$oid": "..."}, ... , "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "rated": "R",
         "metacritic": 80, "title": "The Shawshank Redemption", ... }

      If you encounter an error or see no output, ensure that you specified the
      proper connection string in the ``Main.scala`` file and that you loaded
      the sample data.

      .. tip::

         You can exit the sbt shell by running the following command:

         .. code-block:: none

            exit

After you complete these steps, you have a Scala application that
connects to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on the sample
data, and returns a matching document.
