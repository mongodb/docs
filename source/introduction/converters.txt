Overview
--------

This guide describes how to use **converters** with the {+connector+}.
Converters are programs that translate between bytes and
{+kafka-connect+}'s runtime data format.

Converters pass data between {+kafka-connect+} and Apache Kafka. The connector passes data
between MongoDB and {+kafka-connect+}. The following diagram shows these relationships:

To learn more about converters, see the following resources:

- `Article from Confluent <https://www.confluent.io/blog/kafka-connect-deep-dive-converters-serialization-explained/#configuring-converters>`__.
- `Confluent Article on Kafka Connect Concepts <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/concepts.html#converters>`__
- `Converter Interface API Documentation <{+kafka_api_docs_base+}javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/storage/Converter.html>`__

Available Converters
--------------------

As the connector converts your MongoDB data into {+kafka-connect+}'s runtime data
format, the connector works with all available converters.

.. important:: Use the Same Converter for your Source and Sink Connectors

   You must use the same converter in your {+source-connector+} and {+sink-connector+}.
   For example, if your source connector writes to a topic using Protobuf, your
   sink connector must use Protobuf to read from the topic.

To learn what converter to use, `see this page from Confluent <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/connect.html>`__.

Converters with Schemas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use a schema-based converter such as the {+avro-converter+},
{+protobuf-converter+}, or {+json-schema-converter+}, you should define a schema
in your source connector. 

To learn how to specify a schema, see the 
:ref:`<kafka-source-apply-schemas>` guide.

Connector Configuration
-----------------------

This section provides templates for properties files to configure the following
converters in a connector pipeline:

- :ref:`Avro Converter <avro-converter-sample-properties>`
- :ref:`Protobuf Converter <protobuf-converter-sample-properties>`
- :ref:`JSON Schema Converter <json-schema-converter-sample-properties>`
- :ref:`JSON Converter <json-converter-sample-properties>`
- :ref:`String Converter <string-converter-sample-properties>`

.. _avro-converter-sample-properties:

Avro Converter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click the following tabs to view properties files that work with the Avro converter:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Source
       :tabid: source-avro
 
       The following properties file defines a source connector. This connector
       uses the default schema and an Avro converter to write to an {+kafka+} topic:

          :dedent:

       .. important:: Avro Converter with a MongoDB Data Source

          Avro converters are a great fit for data with a static structure but are not
          a good fit for dynamic or changing data. MongoDB's schemaless document
          model supports dynamic data, so ensure your MongoDB data source has a static
          structure before specifying an Avro converter.

    .. tab:: Sink
       :tabid: sink-avro
