Overview
--------

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is a U.S. government
computer security standard used to certify software modules and
libraries that encrypt and decrypt data securely.  You can configure
MongoDB to run with a FIPS 140-2 certified library
for OpenSSL. Configure FIPS to run by default or as needed from the
command line.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/security-prereq-configure-fips.rst

Only `MongoDB Enterprise`_ edition supports FIPS mode. See
:doc:`/administration/install-enterprise` to download and install
`MongoDB Enterprise`_.

Your system must have an OpenSSL library configured with the FIPS 140-2
module. At the command line, type ``openssl version`` to confirm your
OpenSSL software includes FIPS support.

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x (RHEL 6.x) or its derivatives such as
CentOS 6.x, the OpenSSL toolkit must be at least
``openssl-1.0.1e-16.el6_5`` to use FIPS mode. To upgrade the toolkit for
these platforms, issue the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo yum update openssl

Some versions of Linux periodically execute a process to `prelink` dynamic
libraries with pre-assigned addresses. This process modifies the OpenSSL
libraries, specifically ``libcrypto``. The OpenSSL FIPS mode will
subsequently fail the signature check performed upon startup to ensure
``libcrypto`` has not been modified since compilation.

To configure the Linux prelink process to not prelink ``libcrypto``:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo bash -c "echo '-b /usr/lib64/libcrypto.so.*' >>/etc/prelink.conf.d/openssl-prelink.conf"

Considerations
--------------

FIPS is property of the encryption system and not the access control
system. However, if your environment requires FIPS compliant encryption
*and* access control, you must ensure that the access control system
uses only FIPS-compliant encryption.

MongoDB's FIPS support covers the way that MongoDB uses OpenSSL for
network encryption, SCRAM authentication, and x.509
authentication. If you use Kerberos or LDAP authentication, you must
ensure that these external mechanisms are FIPS-compliant.
The 3.6 deprecated ``MONGODB-CR`` authentication is **not** FIPS compliant.

Procedure
---------

Configure MongoDB to use TLS/SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for details about configuring
OpenSSL. For FIPS mode, ensure that your certificate is FIPS compliant.

Run ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` instance in FIPS mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perform these steps after you :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/fips-config.rst

Confirm that FIPS mode is running
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the server log file for a message that FIPS is active:

.. code-block:: sh

   FIPS 140-2 mode activated
