Install MongoDB on Red Hat Enterprise, CentOS, Fedora, or Amazon Linux

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This tutorial outlines the steps to install :term:`MongoDB` on
Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS Linux, Fedora Linux and related
systems. The tutorial uses ``.rpm`` packages to install. While some of
these distributions include their own MongoDB packages, the official
MongoDB packages are generally more up to date.

Packages
--------

The MongoDB package repository contains five packages:

- ``mongodb-org``

  This package is a ``metapackage`` that will automatically install
  the four component packages listed below.

- ``mongodb-org-server``

  This package contains the :program:`mongod` daemon and associated
  configuration and init scripts.

- ``mongodb-org-mongos``

  This package contains the :program:`mongos` daemon.

- ``mongodb-org-shell``

  This package contains the :program:`mongo` shell.

- ``mongodb-org-tools``

  This package contains the following MongoDB tools: :program:`mongoimport`
  :program:`bsondump`, :program:`mongodump`, :program:`mongoexport`,
  :program:`mongofiles`, :program:`mongoimport`, :program:`mongooplog`,
  :program:`mongoperf`, :program:`mongorestore`, :program:`mongostat`,
  and :program:`mongotop`.

Install MongoDB
---------------

Configure Package Management System (YUM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a ``/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb.repo`` file to hold the
following configuration information for the MongoDB repository:

.. tip:: For production deployments, always run MongoDB on 64-bit
   systems.

If you are running a 64-bit system, use the following configuration:

.. code-block:: cfg

   [mongodb]
   name=MongoDB Repository
   baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/x86_64/
   gpgcheck=0
   enabled=1

If you are running a 32-bit system, which is not recommended for
production deployments, use the following configuration:

.. code-block:: cfg

   [mongodb]
   name=MongoDB Repository
   baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/i686/
   gpgcheck=0
   enabled=1

Install Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the following command (as ``root`` or with ``sudo``) to install
the latest stable version of MongoDB and associated tools:

.. code-block:: sh

   yum install mongodb-org

When this command completes, you have successfully installed MongoDB!

.. _install-rhel-version-pinning:

Manage Installed Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use these packages to install specific releases of MongoDB.
To install a specific release, you must specify the component packages
individually and append the version number to the package names, 
as in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   yum install mongodb-org-2.6.1 mongodb-org-server-2.6.1 mongodb-org-shell-2.6.1 mongodb-org-mongos-2.6.1 mongodb-org-tools-2.6.1

This will install the ``2.6.1`` release of MongoDB. You can specify
any available version of MongoDB; however ``yum`` **will** upgrade the 
packages when a newer version becomes available. Use the following 
*pinning* procedure to prevent unintended upgrades.

To pin a package, add the following line to your ``/etc/yum.conf``
file:

.. code-block:: ini

   exclude=mongodb-org,mongodb-org-server,mongodb-org-shell,mongodb-org-mongos,mongodb-org-tools

.. note::

   Previous versions of :term:`MongoDB` packages use different naming
   conventions. See the :v2.4:`2.4 version of documentation for more
   information </tutorial/install-mongodb-on-linux>`.

Control Scripts
---------------

.. warning::

   With the introduction of ``systemd`` in Fedora 15, the control
   scripts included in the packages available in the MongoDB downloads repository
   are not compatible with Fedora systems. A correction is
   forthcoming, see :issue:`SERVER-7285` for more information, and in
   the mean time use your own control scripts *or* install using the
   procedure outlined in :doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-linux`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-unix-control-scripts.rst

Run MongoDB
-----------

.. important:: You must configure SELinux to allow MongoDB to start on Fedora systems.
   Administrators have two options:

   - enable access to the relevant ports (e.g. 27017) for SELinux. See
     :ref:`security-port-numbers` for more information on MongoDB's
     :doc:`default ports </reference/default-mongodb-port>`.

   - disable SELinux entirely. This requires a system reboot and may have
     larger implications for your deployment.

Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-unix-data-and-log-dir.rst

Start the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the following command
(as root or with ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: sh

   service mongod start

You can verify that the :program:`mongod` process has started
successfully by checking the contents of the log file at
``/var/log/mongo/mongod.log``.

You may optionally ensure that MongoDB will start following a system
reboot by issuing the following command (with root privileges:)

.. code-block:: sh

   chkconfig mongod on

Stop MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stop the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the following command
(as root or with ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: sh

   service mongod stop

Restart MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can restart the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the following
command (as root or with ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: sh

   service mongod restart

Follow the state of this process by watching the output in the
``/var/log/mongo/mongod.log`` file to watch for errors or important
messages from the server.
