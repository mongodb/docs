   The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is an administrative command that
   allows you to rotate
   the MongoDB logs to prevent a single logfile from consuming too
   much disk space.
   You must issue the
   :dbcommand:`logRotate`
   command against the :term:`admin database` in the form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { logRotate: 1 }

   .. note::

      Your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance needs to be running with the
      :option:`--logpath [file] <mongod --logpath>` option.

   You may also rotate the logs by sending a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` process.
   If your :binary:`~bin.mongod` has a process ID of 2200, here's how to
   send the signal on Linux:

   .. code-block:: sh

       kill -SIGUSR1 2200

   :dbcommand:`logRotate` renames the existing log file by
   appending the current timestamp to the filename.  The appended
   timestamp has the following form:

   .. code-block:: none

      <YYYY>-<mm>-<DD>T<HH>-<MM>-<SS>

   Then :dbcommand:`logRotate` creates a new log file with the same
   name as originally specified by the :setting:`logpath` setting to
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

   .. note::

      .. versionadded:: 2.0.3
         The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is available to
         :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances running on Windows systems with
         MongoDB release 2.0.3 and higher.

.. :error:`16175` is thrown if logRotate fails
