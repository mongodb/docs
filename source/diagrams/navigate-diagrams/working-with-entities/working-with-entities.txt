After you :ref:`create a project <rm-create-project-live>`, Relational Migrator creates an 
initial diagram containing the entities and relationships in 
the Relational and MongoDB models. The term "entity" refers to either a table in 
the relational model, or a collection in the MongoDB model. You can move and 
modify entities to customize your initial diagram and create additional diagrams.
