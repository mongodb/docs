MongoDB runs well on `Amazon EC2 <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/>`_. This page
includes some notes in this regard.

Getting Started on EC2
----------------------

This guide provides instructions for using the MongoDB AMI to set up
production instances of MongoDB across Amazon's Web Services (AWS) EC2
infrastructure.

First, we'll step through deployment planning (instance specifications,
deployment size, etc.) and then we'll set up a single production node.
We'll use those setup steps to deploy a three node MongoDB replica set
for production use. Finally, we'll briefly cover some advanced topics
such as multi-region availability and data backups.

Backup, Restore, Verify
-----------------------

Depending upon the configuration of your EC2 instances, there are a
number of ways to conduct regular backups of your data. For specific
instructions on backing up, restoring and verifying refer to
:ref:`ec2-backup-and-restore`.

Deployment Notes
----------------

MongoDB via AWS Marketplace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed MongoDB via the AWS Marketplace refer to the
:ref:`deploy-mongodb-from-aws-marketplace` guide to get a development
instance up and running. If you are interested in creating a production
deployment, refer to the :ref:`install-mongodb-on-amazon-ec2`. Start with the
section on :ref:`install-mongodb-on-amazon-ec2` to set up a place for
your data to be stored. After that refer to the
:ref:`ec2-starting-mongodb` section to get your MongoDB instance
running. If you're interested in scaling your deployment, check out the
sections on :ref:`ec2-deploy-multinode-replica-set` and
:ref:`ec2-deploy-a-sharded-configuration`.

Automate Deployment with CloudFormation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CloudFormation from Amazon Web Services provides an easy mechanism to
create and manage a collection of AWS resources. To use CloudFormation
you create and deploy a template which describes the resources in your
stack via the AWS Management Console. We have created a series of
reference templates that you can use as a starting point to build your
own MongoDB deployments using CloudFormation. Check out
:ref:`automate-deployment-with-cloudformation`
for a walkthrough and the template files.

Instance Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB works on most EC2 types including Linux and Windows.  We
recommend you use a 64 bit instance as this is
`required for all MongoDB databases of significant size <http://blog.mongodb.org/post/137788967/32-bit-limitations>`_.
Additionally, we find that the larger instances tend to be on the
freshest ec2 hardware.

Install MongoDB
```````````````

One can download a binary or build from source.  Generally it is easier
to download a binary.  We can download and run the binary without being
root.  For example on 64 bit Linux:

.. code-blocK:: sh

   [~]$ curl -O http://downloads.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.4.3.tgz
   [~]$ tar -xzf mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.4.3.tgz
   [~]$ cd mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.4.3.tgz/bin
   [bin]$ ./mongod --version

Before running the database one should decide where to put
datafiles.  Run :program:`df -h` to see volumes.
On some images :file:`/mnt`
will be the many locally attached storage volume. Alternatively you may
want to use `Elastic Block Store <http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/>`_ which will
have a different mount point.

If you mount the file-system, ensure that you mount with the
:option:`noatime <mount -o noatime>` and
:option:`nodiratime <mount -o nodiratime>` attributes, for example:

.. code-block:: sh

   /dev/mapper/my_vol /var/lib/mongodb xfs noatime,noexec,nodiratime 0 0

Create the mongodb datafile directory in the desired location and then
run the database:

.. code-block:: sh

   mkdir /mnt/db
   ./mongod --fork --logpath ~/mongod.log --dbpath /mnt/db/


Operating System
````````````````

Occasionally, due to the shared and virtualized nature of EC2, an
instance can experience intermittent I/O problems and low responsiveness
compared to other similar instances. Terminating the instance and
bringing up a new one can in some cases result in better performance.

Some people have reported problems with ubuntu 10.04 on ec2.

Please read
`Ubuntu issue 614853 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/+bug/614853>`_
and
`Linux Kernel issue 16991 <https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16991>`_ for further
information.

Networking
~~~~~~~~~~

Port Management
```````````````

By default the database will now be listening on port 27017. The web
administrative UI will be on port 28017.

Keepalive
`````````

Change the default TCP keepalive time to 300 seconds. See our
:manual:`troubleshooting </faq/diagnostics>` page for details.

Storage Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For production use, we recommend raid 10 across 4-8 ebs drives for best
performance. Local ec2 drives may be faster but are generally not
suitable as they are ephemeral. Multiple ebs drives increase the
potential number of random IO's per second (iops), but not necessarily
sequential read/write throughput much.  In most database applications
random iops are important.

For more information, refer to `EBS info at Amazon Web Services <http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/>`_.

EBS Snapshots
`````````````

If your datafiles are on a single EBS volume, you can snapshot them for
backups.

If you are using :manual:`journaling </administration/journaling>`, simply take a
snapshot (including the :file:`journal/` directory).

If not using journaling, you need to use the lock+fsync command (v1.3.1+).

Use this command to lock the database to prevent writes. Then, snapshot
the volume.  Then use the unlock command to allow writes to the
database again. See the full :ref:`ec2-backup-and-restore` guide
for more information.
This method may also be used with slaves / secondaries.

Secure Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Restrict access to your instances by using the Security Groups feature
within AWS. A Security Group is a set of firewall rules for incoming
packets that can apply to TCP, UDP or ICMP.

A common approach is to create a MongoDB security group that contains
the nodes of your cluster (replica set members or sharded cluster
members), followed by the creation of a separate security group for your
app servers or clients.

Create a rule in your MongoDB security group with the "source" field set
to the Security Group name containing your app servers and the port set
to 27017 (or whatever port you use for your MongoDB). This will ensure
that only your app servers have permission to connect to your MongoDB
instances.

Remember that Security Groups only control ingress traffic.

Communication Across Regions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every EC2 instance will have a private IP address that can be used to
communicate within the EC2 network. It is also possible to assign a
public "elastic" IP to communicate with the servers from another
network. If using different EC2 regions, servers can only communicate
via public IPs.

To set up a cluster of servers that spans multiple regions, it is
recommended to cname the server hostname to the "public dns name"
provided by EC2. This will ensure that servers from a different network
use the public IP, while the local servers use the private IP, thereby
saving costs. This is required since EC2 security groups are local to a
region.

To control communications between instances in different regions (for
example, if you have two members of a replica set in one region and a
third member in another), it is possible to use a built-in firewall
(such as IPtables on Linux) to restrict allowed traffic to certain
(elastic) IP addresses or ports.

For example one solution is following, on each server:

* set the hostname of the server

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo hostname server1

* install "bind", it will serve as local resolver
* add a zone for your domain, say "myorg.com", and add the CNAMEs for all your servers

.. code-block:: sh

   server1          IN     CNAME   ec2-50-19-237-42.compute-1.amazonaws.com.
   server2          IN     CNAME   ec2-50-18-157-87.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com.

* restart bind and modify /etc/resolv.conf to use the local bind

.. code-block:: sh

   search myorg.conf
   nameserver 127.0.0.1

Then:

   * verify that you can properly resolve server1, server2, ... using a
     tool like dig.

   * when running mongod, :method:`mongodb-manual:db.serverStatus()`
     should show the correct hostname, e.g. "server1:27017".

   * you can then set up replica sets or shards using the simple
     hostname. For example connect to server1 and run :samp:`rs.initiate()`,
     then :samp:`rs.add('server2:27017')`.
