.. important:: ``mongo`` Shell Method


   This page documents the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method, and does
   *not* refer to the MongoDB Node.js driver (or any other driver)
   method. For corresponding MongoDB driver API, refer to your specific
   :ecosystem:`MongoDB driver </drivers>` documentation instead.
