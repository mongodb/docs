Number charts display a single aggregated value from a data field.

Number Chart Encoding Channel
-----------------------------

Number charts only require a single encoding channel, called
:guilabel:`Number`. This is an :guilabel:`aggregation` encoding channel
which aggregates based on the field and aggregation method chosen, and
displays the result in the chart.

Use Cases
---------

Number charts are useful for highlighting grand totals or values which
represent the overall state of your data. For example, a store may use
a number chart to represent the total dollar value of all sales.
Additionally, a hotel chain may use a number chart to represent the
average number of vacant rooms across all hotels, or apply a
:ref:`filter <charts-filter-documents>` to see the total number of
vacant rooms in a select region.

Examples
--------

Total Value of Store Sales
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following chart visualizes sales data from a mock office supply
store. Each document in the collection represents an individual sale,
which contains information on the item(s) sold and the purchaser. This
number chart shows the total sum of all sales stored in the collection:

   :figwidth: 720px
   :alt: Sales number chart example

The :guilabel:`Number` field of ``items.price`` tells |charts| to
aggregate the field based on the selected method of
:manual:`$sum </reference/operator/aggregation/sum/>`. Since
``items`` is an array, we have to select an array reduction option
before we can aggregate. In this example, we choose
:guilabel:`Unwind Array`, which creates a new document for each
element in the ``items`` array. |charts| sums the ``price`` of each
newly created document and displays the value in the visualization.

Maximum Calories Burned During Workouts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following chart visualizes workout data. Each document in the
collection represents an individual workout activity, which contains
information on the type of activity performed and the amount of
calories burned during the workout. This number chart shows the
maximum calories burned across all ``swimming`` and ``surfing``
workouts:

.. figure:: /images/charts/number-chart-example-2.png
   :figwidth: 720px
   :alt: Workout number chart example

The :guilabel:`Number` field of ``Calories Burned (kCal)`` tells
|charts| to aggregate the field based on the selected method of
:manual:`$max </reference/operator/aggregation/max/>`.

We have applied a :ref:`filter <charts-filter-documents>` to this chart
to restrict the documents |charts| examines to only those with an
``Activity Type`` of ``Surf``, ``Swim``, or ``Indoor Swim``. |charts|
determines the maximum value of the ``Calories Burned (kCal)`` field
across all documents which match this criteria and displays the value
in the visualization.
