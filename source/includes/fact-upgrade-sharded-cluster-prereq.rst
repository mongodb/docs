Before you start the upgrade, ensure that the amount of free space on
the filesystem for the :doc:`config database
</reference/config-database>` is 4 to 5 times the amount of space
currently used by the :doc:`config database
</reference/config-database>` data files.

Additionally, ensure that all indexes in the 
:doc:`config database </reference/config-database>` 
are ``{v:1}`` indexes. If a critical
index is a ``{v:0}`` index, the shard chunk split can fail once
the upgrade is complete.
