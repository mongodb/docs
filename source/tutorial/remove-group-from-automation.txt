When the |mms| Free Trial period expires, |mms| Automation is disabled
for your |mms| Projects. As Automation no longer manages your MongoDB
processes, you need to remove your MongoDB processes from Automation and
configure them to use Monitoring and Backup without Automation.

.. note::
   
   If you choose to stop using |mms| Automation for a project, |mms| will continue to monitor the
   project's deployments but will track metrics at a less granular level and store metrics for
   a shorter period.

To instead unmanage individual deployments and still use Automation for the project, see
:doc:`/tutorial/unmanage-deployment`.

To stop using Automation with your Projects, you should:

.. include:: /includes/steps/remove-group-from-automation.rst
