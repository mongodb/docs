|mms-full| can automate, monitor, and back up your MongoDB
infrastructure.

.. _automation:

Automation
----------

|mms| Automation enables you to configure and maintain MongoDB nodes
and clusters.

MongoDB Agents using Automation on each MongoDB host can maintain your
MongoDB deployments. You can
:doc:`install </tutorial/nav/install-mongodb-agent>` the
:doc:`MongoDB Agent </tutorial/nav/mongodb-agent>`. Automation can
:doc:`add hosts </tutorial/nav/add-servers>` and
:doc:`deploy and upgrade new or existing clusters </tutorial/nav/manage-hosts>`.

.. _monitoring-functional-overview:

Monitoring
----------

|mms| Monitoring provides real-time reporting, visualization, and
alerting on key database and hardware indicators.

How Monitoring Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you activate Monitoring on a MongoDB host, Monitoring collects
statistics from the nodes in your MongoDB deployment. The Agent
transmits database statistics back to |mms| to report deployment status
in real time. You can :doc:`set alerts </tutorial/nav/alerts>` on
indicators you choose.

.. _mms-backup-functional-overview:

Backup
------

|mms| Backup provides scheduled
:doc:`snapshots </tutorial/nav/backup-use-operations>` and
point-in-time
:doc:`recovery </tutorial/nav/backup-restore-deployments>`
of your MongoDB :term:`replica sets <replica set>` and
:term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`.

How Backup Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you activate Backup for a MongoDB deployment, Backup takes
snapshots of data from the MongoDB processes you have specified.

Backup Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backups rely upon the
:manual:`MongoDB version compatibility</reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`
of your database.
This Feature Compatibility Version ranges from the current version to
one version earlier. For MongoDB 4.2, the FCV can be ``4.0`` or
``4.2``.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      Once backup has started, |mms| backs up the data as an ongoing
      and continuous process. This process continues creating snapshots
      as long as the head database remains synchronized with the
      database.

      .. include:: /includes/backup/legacy-process-overview-main-om.rst

      .. cond:: onprem

         The {+mdbagent+} then tails each replica set's :term:`oplog`
         to maintain on disk a standalone database, called a
         :term:`head database <head database>`. |mms| maintains one
         head database for each backed-up replica set. The head
         database stays consistent with the original :term:`primary` up
         to the last oplog that the {+mdbagent+} supplies.

      .. cond:: cloud

         The {+mdbagent+} then tails each replica set's :term:`oplog`
         to update the backup when performing a point-in-time restore.
         The backup is consistent with the original primary up to the
         last oplog that the {+mdbagent+} supplies.

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      .. include:: /includes/backup/wtchk-process-overview-main-om.rst

      The {+mdbagent+} uses WiredTiger's incremental backup cursor to
      capture the incremental changes.

The backup process works in this manner regardless of how snapshots are
stored.

Backup uses a MongoDB instance version equal to or greater than the
version of the replica set it backs up.

Backup takes and stores snapshots based on a user-defined
:ref:`snapshot retention policy <snapshot-frequency-and-retention>`.
Sharded cluster snapshots temporarily stop the balancer. The snapshots
then can insert a marker token into all shards and config servers in
the cluster. |mms| takes a :term:`snapshot` when the marker tokens
appear in the snapshot data.

         How much storage capacity you need depends on both the number
         of snapshots and the type of snapshot storage you choose. The
         following table outlines the differences in snapshot stores:

         .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1
            :widths: 25 75

            * - Snapshot Store
              - Description

            * - MongoDB blockstore
              - Only the differences between each successive
                :term:`snapshot` are stored. Compression and
                block-level :term:`deduplication` reduce the size of
                snapshot data.

            * - |aws| |s3| bucket
              - Only the differences between each successive
                :term:`snapshot` are stored. Compression and
                block-level :term:`deduplication` reduce the size of
                snapshot data.

            * - File system store
              - Depending on the configuration, compression reduces the
                size of the :term:`snapshot` data.

         All snapshots represent a full backup.

      .. tab:: FCV of 4.2 or later
         :tabid: fcv42

         |mms| can back up data as a full or incremental backup. |mms|
         requires a full backup:

         - For your first backup,
         - After a snapshot has been deleted, and
         - If the blockstore block size has been changed.

         Incremental backups reduce network transfer and storage costs.

To learn more about how to configure backups, see
:doc:`Backup Configuration Options </core/backup-preparations>`.

.. cond:: cloud

   Monthly backup costs for |mms| are based on the size per-gigabyte
   of your most recent snapshot. To learn about |mms| backup pricing,
   see :ref:`Backup Costs <backup-pricing>`.

.. _restores:

Restore Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backup can restore data from a complete scheduled snapshot or from
a selected point between snapshots.

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      - For :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`, you can restore
        from :ref:`checkpoints <checkpoint>` between snapshots.

      - For :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, you can restore from
        selected points in time.

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      You can restore :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` and
      :term:`replica sets <replica set>` from selected points in time.

When you restore from a :term:`snapshot`, |mms| reads directly from
the snapshot storage. You can restore the snapshot:

- To another cluster or
- Download the snapshot files from an |https| link.

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      When you restore from a checkpoint or point in time, |mms|
      restores a full snapshot from the snapshot storage. |mms| then
      applies stored :term:`oplogs <oplog>` until it reaches the
      specified point. |mms| delivers the snapshot and oplog updates
      using the same |https| mechanisms. To enable checkpoints, see
      :ref:`enable-cluster-checkpoints`.

      .. cond:: onprem

         You can configure how much of the oplog you want to keep per
         backup. This affects how much time a checkpoint and
         point-in-time restore can cover.

   .. tab:: FCV of 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      When you restore from a point in time, |mms| restores a full
      snapshot from the snapshot storage. |mms| then applies stored
      :term:`oplogs <oplog>` until it reaches the specified point.
      |mms| delivers the snapshot and oplog updates using the same
      |https| mechanisms.

      .. cond:: onprem

         You can configure how much of the oplog you want to keep per
         backup. This affects how much time a point-in-time restore can
         cover.
