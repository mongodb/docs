      * - Field

        - Contents

      * - :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>`

        - Type in one or more hosts that comprise the Oplog Store
          database in the ``<hostname:port>`` format.

          .. important::

             If these hosts are changed, the Oplog Store database
             they host must have the same data as the original Oplog Store
             database. Changing the host to a new Oplog Store
             database results in data loss.

          - If the Oplog Store database is a Replica Set or Sharded Cluster,
            type a comma-separated list of :program:`mongod` instances (for a
            Replica Set) or :program:`mongos` instances (for a Sharded
            Cluster).

            .. example::

               ``host1.example.com:27017, host2.example.com:27017, host2.example.com:27018``

          - If the Oplog Store database is a standalone MongoDB
            instance, type the ``hostname:port`` of the instance.

   .. warning::

      Modifying the connection string values or the Write Concern for an existing blockstore
      requires you to restart all |onprem| components, including those only
      running the Backup Daemon to apply those changes. Connection parameters
      include:

      - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Username`
      - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`
      - :guilabel:`Encrypted Credentials`

      - :guilabel:`Connection Options`
      - :guilabel:`Write Concern`

      If you change to another Oplog Store host, the data on the existing
      Oplog Store is not copied automatically to the other Oplog Store.
