   :description: Learn how to install and upgrade PyMongoArrow using pip, conda, or from source, and understand its system and Python compatibility requirements.

In this guide, you can learn how to install and upgrade {+driver-short+}.

System Compatibility
--------------------

{+driver-short+} is regularly built and tested on macOS and Linux
(Ubuntu 20.04).

Python Compatibility
--------------------

{+driver-short+} is compatible with CPython versions 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13.

Installation
------------

You can install **{+driver-short+}** in three ways:

- Pip 
- Conda
- From source

Install with Pip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend using pip to install {+driver-short+} on all platforms.
{+driver-short+} is available on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/>`_.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install pymongoarrow

To get a specific version of pymongo:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install pymongoarrow=={+patch-version-number+}

To upgrade using pip:

.. code-block:: sh
   
   $ python -m pip install --upgrade pymongoarrow

.. important:: 

   If the install fails because of an error, such as ``ValueError: Could
   not find "libbson-1.0" library``, it means that ``pip`` failed to find a
   suitable wheel for your platform. We recommend first ensuring you have
   ``pip`` >= 20.3 installed. To upgrade ``pip``, run the following shell command:

   .. code-block:: python

      $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip

You can then try to re-install ``pymongoarrow``.

We currently distribute wheels for macOS, Windows, and Linux on x86_64
architectures.

Install with Conda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyMongoArrow is available for ``conda`` users by running the following shell
command:

.. code-block:: python

   $ conda install --channel conda-forge pymongoarrow

Install from Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you can't use the above options to install ``pymongoarrow`` on your
system, you can install from source. To learn how, see the `Contributing Guide
<https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongo-arrow/blob/main/bindings/python/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-source>`__.

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

{+driver-short+} requires the following dependencies:

- PyMongo version 4.4 or later
- PyArrow version 17.0 or later

Installing from source on Linux requires the following additional dependencies: 

- GCC version 12 or later
- CMake
- pkg-config

To use {+driver-short+} with a PyMongo feature that requires an optional
dependency, you must set the dependency as an option when you install PyMongo.

.. note:: 

   To learn more about PyMongo's optional dependencies, see
   `Dependencies
   <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#dependencies>`__
   in the PyMongo documentation.

For example, to use {+driver-short+} with Client-Side Field Level Encryption,
you must install PyMongo with the ``encryption`` option in addition to installing
{+driver-short+}:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install 'pymongo[encryption]' pymongoarrow

Applications using {+driver-short+} APIs that return query result-sets
as ``pandas.DataFrame`` instances, such as ``~pymongoarrow.api.find_pandas_all()``,
must also have ``pandas`` installed:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install pandas
