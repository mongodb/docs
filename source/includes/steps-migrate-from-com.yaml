  a. In the left-side panel of your organization's page,
     click :guilabel:`Live Migration`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Migrate from Ops Manager or Cloud Manager`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`I'm Ready to Start` and, if you are
     :opsmgr:`migrating </tutorial/migrate-community-to-atlas>`
     from MongoDB Community using |onprem|, click :guilabel:`Ops Manager
     License Agreement` to read and accept it. To read the text of the
     agreement outside of the Live Migration Wizard, see the
     :opsmgr:`Ops Manager Migration Agreement
     </reference/legal/live-migration-atlas-licensing>`.

  |service| displays a Live Migration wizard with instructions on how
  to proceed with the live migration process. The process pushes the
  data from your source cluster to the new target cluster. After you
  complete the wizard steps, you can point your application to the new
  cluster.

ref: live-migration-com-link-with-atlas
level: 4
content: |

  a. Click :guilabel:`Generate Link-Token`. |service| displays the
     page for generating a :term:`link-token`.

     - If you are migrating from |onprem|, enter the external IP addresses
       or a |cidr| block of your |onprem| instances to add them to the access
       list of the API Key embedded in the link-token. This allows |onprem|
       to send project and cluster information to |service|.
       |onprem| does not send any data stored in your MongoDB databases
       in this step. For example, enter ``23.248.95.14``.
     - If you are migrating from |mms|, skip this step.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Next` to see a page that contains the generated link-token.

  #. Copy the link-token and store it in a secure location. |service|
     never displays the contents of the link-token. |service| also does
     not display the link-token after generating it. Do not
     share it publicly.

     .. note::
        Use one unique :term:`link-token` for live migrating all
        projects in one |com| organization to |service|.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Done`.

ref: live-migration-from-com-paste-link-token
level: 4

  a. Access the organization in |com|:
  
     Open |onprem| or |mms|, and navigate to the organization
     whose project's cluster you are live migrating to |service|.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Settings` in the left navigation panel.

  #. In the :guilabel:`Live Migration: Connect to Atlas` section, click
     :guilabel:`Connect to Atlas`. The :guilabel:`Connect to Atlas`
     dialog opens.

  #. Paste the link-token you generated in the previous step of the
     Live Migration wizard and click :guilabel:`Connect to Atlas`.
     |com| establishes the connection to |service|. Use the
     :guilabel:`Refresh` button to send an update to |service|, if
     needed. To learn more, see
     :opsmgr:`Connect to Atlas for Live Migration
     </tutorial/connect-to-atlas-live-migration>` in Ops Manager, or
     :cloudmgr:`Connect to Atlas for Live Migration
     </tutorial/connect-to-atlas-live-migration>` in |mms|.

  If you haven't already, create a target cluster in |service|. See

    a. Click :guilabel:`Select Target Cluster from Projects`.

    #. Go to your target |service| cluster's project and find your target
       cluster.

    #. Click :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` and select :guilabel:`Migrate Data to this Cluster`
       from the dropdown list to start the migration.
       The :guilabel:`Migrate Data to This Cluster` page opens.

    #. Click :guilabel:`Migrate from Ops Manager or Cloud Manager` and
       fill in the fields as follows:

       - Select the source project in |com|, if it is not already selected.
       - Select a migration host for handling the migration.

       - Review the IP address access list and check that the migration
         host's external IP address is included in this list. If it is
         not added, add it now:
         
         - Click :guilabel:`Set Network Access for Host`
         - Click :guilabel:`+ Add IP Address`
         - Return to the Live Migration wizard. Select the source
           cluster from the dropdown and choose
           :guilabel:`Migrate data to this cluster` under :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h`.
       
       - Select the source cluster from the drop-down.
       - If the source cluster uses |tls-ssl|, toggle the
         :guilabel:`Is SSL enabled?` button.
       - If the source cluster uses |tls-ssl| with a custom Root
         Certificate Authority (CA), copy the path to the
         :abbr:`CA (Certificate Authority)` file from your migration
         host and paste this path into the provided text box.
         This file must be present on the migration host, to ensure
         the migration host can read the certificate.
       - If your replica set target cluster has data, and you want to preserve it,
         keep the :guilabel:`Clear any existing data on your target cluster` option
         unchecked. The live migration service warns you if it finds duplicate
         namespaces. If you want to delete the existing data, check this
         option.
    
       - Click :guilabel:`Validate`. The validation process ensures that
         your migration host is reachable, and performs other validation
         checks to ensure that you can start live migration to |service|.

         If you are migrating from |onprem| before version 5.0.9, the
         live migration process validates that the target cluster has
         enough disk space based on the data size. If you are migrating
         from |mms| or |onprem| 5.0.9 or later, the migration process
         validates that the target cluster has enough disk space based on
         the storage size of the compressed data. To learn more about data
         and storage sizes, see :manual:`dbStats </reference/command/dbStats/#output>`.

         If validation fails, check the migration host, the validity of
         your external IP addresses or |cidr| block, and the link-token.
       - If validation succeeds, click :guilabel:`Next`. The
         :guilabel:`Migrate from Ops Manager or Cloud Manager` page displays.

   a. Review the report listing your source organization, project and

      will use.

     A lag time value dispays during the final oplog tailing phase that
     represents the current lag between the source and target clusters.
     This lag time may fluctuate depending on the rate of oplog generation
     on the source cluster, but should decrease over time as the live
     migration process copies the oplog entries to the target cluster.

     a. When the lag timer and the :guilabel:`Prepare to Cutover` button
        turn green, click it to proceed to the next step.

ref: live-import-com-prepare-cutover

  When |service| detects that the source and target clusters are
  nearly in sync, it starts an extendable 120 hour (5 day) timer to
  begin the cutover stage of the live migration procedure. If the
  120 hour period passes, |service| stops synchronizing with the source
  cluster. You can extend the time remaining by 24 hours by clicking
  :guilabel:`Extend time` below the :guilabel:`<time> left to cut over`
  timer.

  To finish migrating your MongoDB data to your |service| cluster,
  complete the following steps on the
  :guilabel:`Your migration is almost complete!` page:

  1. Prepare to point to your |service| cluster. Copy the new
     :manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>` so that
     you can update it and point your application to the target
     |service| cluster.

  #. Stop your application. This ensures that no more writes occur on the
     source cluster.

  #. Wait for the optime gap to reach zero. When the counter reaches zero,
     the source and target clusters are in sync.

  #. Wait approximately 3-5 minutes until your |service| cluster is
     ready to use.

  #. Restart your application using the new |service| connection
     string and confirm that your application is working with the
     |service| cluster.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Cut Over` to complete the migration process.

     If you click :guilabel:`Cancel` on the live migration progress bar,
     |service| stops synchronizing writes from the source cluster.
     All migrated data remains on your |service| cluster.

     You can click :guilabel:`Cut Over` again to allow |service| to
     complete the migration process.
