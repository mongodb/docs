Overview
--------

This page describes the connection options available in the {+driver-short+} and
explains how to apply them to your MongoDB connection.

How to Specify Connection Options
---------------------------------

The following sections describe the ways in which you can specify connection options.

.. _c-connection-uri:

Use the Connection String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you pass a connection string to the ``monogoc_client_t`` structure, you can include
connection options in the string as ``<name>=<value>`` pairs. In the following example,
the connection string contains the ``connectTimeoutMS`` option with a value of ``60000``
and the ``tls`` option with a value of ``true``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-options.c
   :language: c
   :dedent:
   :start-after: // start-connection-uri
   :end-before: // end-connection-uri

To learn more about the options that you can specify in a connection string, see
:manual:`Connection String Options </reference/connection-string-options>` in the
{+mdb-server+} manual.

.. _c-mongo-client-settings:

Use the URI Options API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use URI options to configure connection settings in code
rather than in a connection string. Configuring the connection this way makes it easier to
change settings at runtime, helps you catch errors during compilation, and provides
more configuration options than the connection string.

To set connection options by using the URI option, perform the
following steps:

1. Create a ``mongoc_uri_t`` struct with your connection string
#. Use a URI option function to specify your desired connection option
#. Create a new client with the URI by passing the URI to ``mongoc_client_new_from_uri()``

The following code example shows how to perform the preceding steps:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-options.c
   :language: c
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-mongoc-uri
   :end-before: end-mongoc-uri

Connection Options
------------------

The following sections describe the connection options available in the
{+driver-short+} and how to specify them by using a connection string directly or
a URI option.
