Overview
--------

|mms| offers three plans, as described in the features list on
`https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager>`_. Each plan
provides the monitoring metrics described here.

.. note:: Beginning with Monitoring Agent version 5.0.0, **Cloud Manager Premium**
          uses 10-second granularity for monitoring metrics.

Monitoring Metrics Per Plan
---------------------------

|mms| gathers metric data at a given granularity, depending on your |mms|
plan. |mms| stores metrics data at increasing granularity levels. For each
increasing granularity level, |mms| computes the metrics data based on the
averages from the previous granularity level. The length of retention depends
on the granularity.

.. note::

   |mms| gathers :guilabel:`Replication Lag` and :guilabel:`Replication Headroom`
   metrics at an 85-second granularity regardless of your |mms| plan or your
   project's granularity level.

The following table shows monitoring metrics for each |mms| plan.

   * - |mms| Plan
     - Monitoring Data Storage Granularity
     - Database-Specific Statistics
     - Retention Rate for MongoDB Logs

   * - Premium

     - Data gathered at a 10-second granularity and retained at the following
       granularities for the following periods of time:

       .. list-table::

          * - 10 seconds
            - 24 hours

          * - 1 min
            - 14 days

          * - 5 min
            - 14 days

          * - 1 hour
            - 12 months (52 weeks)

          * - 1 day
            - forever

       You must run {+magent+}
       version 5.0.0 to store data at 10-second granularity. Earlier versions
       of the agent store data at 1-minute granularity.

     - All database-specific stats are retained.

     - MongoDB log data retained at a maximum rate of 2000 lines per minute.

   * - Standard

     - Data gathered at a 1-minute granularity and retained at the following
       granularities for the following periods of time:

       .. list-table::

          * - 1 min

            - 48 hours

          * - 5 min

            - 48 hours

          * - 1 hour

            - 63 days

          * - 1 day

            - forever

     - All database-specific stats are retained.

     - MongoDB log data retained at a maximum rate of 2000 lines per 2 minutes.

   * - Free Tier
     - Data gathered at a 5-minute granularity and retained for 24 hours.
     - For hosts with greater than 1000 databases, only the following database-specific
       stats are retained: file size, data size, storage size, index size.
     - MongoDB log data retained at a maximum rate of 2000 lines per 3 minutes.

For **all plans**, chunk counts are stored for sharded clusters with fewer than
1000 sharded collections.

.. note:: In the event of higher than expected load, monitoring data for all
          plans may be throttled.
