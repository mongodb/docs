The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a
:binary:`~bin.mongod` that is a shard member from version |oldversion|
to |newversion|.

.. include:: /includes/upgrade-guidance-checklists.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

All Members Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade a sharded cluster to |newversion|, **all** members of the
cluster must be at least version |oldversion|. The upgrade process
checks all components of the cluster and will produce warnings if any
component is running version earlier than |oldversion|.

Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |oldversion| sharded cluster must have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to |oldfcv|. 

To ensure that all members of the sharded cluster have
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to |oldfcv|, connect to each
shard replica set member and each config server replica set member
and check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. tip::

   For a sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the
   following command against a shard replica set member, you must
   connect to the member as a :ref:`shard local user
   <shard-local-users>`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

All members should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "6.0" }``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the
following command on the :binary:`~bin.mongos`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "6.0" } )

For more information, see
:dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Replica Set Member State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For shards and config servers, ensure that no replica set member is in
the :replstate:`ROLLBACK` or :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { replSetGetStatus: 1 } )

Back up the ``config`` Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Optional but Recommended.* As a precaution, take a backup of the
``config`` database *before* upgrading the sharded cluster.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Use Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Download |newversion| Binaries Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.

Upgrade Procedure
-----------------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Disable the Balancer.  
   
      .. _7.0-upgrade-disable-balancer:

      Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance 
      in the sharded cluster, and run :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` to
      disable the balancer:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.stopBalancer()

      .. note::

         If a migration is in progress, the system will complete the
         in-progress migration before stopping the balancer. You can run
         :method:`sh.isBalancerRunning()` to check the balancer's current
         state.

         To verify that the balancer is disabled, run
         :method:`sh.getBalancerState()`, which returns false if the 
         balancer is disabled:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.getBalancerState()

      For more information on disabling the balancer, see
      :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily`.
 
   .. step:: Upgrade the config servers. 

      .. _7.0-upgrade-config-servers:

      a. Upgrade the :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>` 
         members of the replica set, one at a time.

         i. Shut down the secondary instance.

            To shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process, use 
            :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to connect to the cluster member and 
            run the following command:

            .. code-block:: javascript

               db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

         #. Replace the |oldversion| binary with the |newversion| binary.
                          
         #. Start the |newversion| binary. 
    
            Start the |newversion| binary with the :option:`--configsvr <mongod --configsvr>`,
            :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`, and :option:`--port <mongod --port>`. 
            Include any other options as used by the deployment.
             
            .. code-block:: bash
            
               mongod --configsvr --replSet <replSetName> --port <port> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>
             
            If using a :ref:`configuration file
            <configuration-options>`, update the file to
            specify :setting:`sharding.clusterRole: configsvr
            <sharding.clusterRole>`, :setting:`replication.replSetName`,
            :setting:`net.port`, and :setting:`net.bindIp`,
            then start the |newversion| binary:
                      
            .. code-block:: yaml
             
               sharding:
                  clusterRole: configsvr
               replication:
                  replSetName: <string>
               net:
                  port: <port>
                  bindIp: localhost,<ip address>
               storage:
                  dbpath: <path>
             
            Include any other settings as appropriate for your deployment.
                     
         #. Wait for the member to recover to the ``SECONDARY`` state before upgrading the next secondary member. 
               
            To check the member's state, issue :method:`rs.status()` in 
            :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.
            
         #. Repeat for each secondary member.

      #. Step down the replica set primary. 
   
         i. Step down the primary.

            Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the primary and use
            :method:`rs.stepDown()` to :term:`step down` the primary and force an
            election of a new primary:
           
            .. code-block:: javascript
                 
               rs.stepDown()
               
         #. Shut down the stepped-down primary.
            
            When :method:`rs.status()` shows that the primary has stepped
            down and another member has assumed the ``PRIMARY`` state, shut 
            down the stepped-down primary. 

            To shut down the stepped-down primary, use 
            :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to connect to the primary and 
            run the following command:

            .. code-block:: javascript

               db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

         #. Replace the :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with the |newversion| binary.
               
         #. Start the |newversion| binary. 
            
            Start the |newversion| with the :option:`--configsvr <mongod --configsvr>`, 
            :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`,
            :option:`--port <mongod --port>`, and :option:`--bind_ip
            <mongod --bind_ip>` options. Include any optional command line
            options used by the previous deployment:
    
            .. code-block:: bash
    
               mongod --configsvr --replSet <replSetName> --port <port> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>
       
            If using a :ref:`configuration file
            <configuration-options>`, update the file to
            specify :setting:`sharding.clusterRole: configsvr
            <sharding.clusterRole>`, :setting:`replication.replSetName`,
            :setting:`net.port`, and :setting:`net.bindIp`,
            then start the |newversion| binary:
       
                
            .. code-block:: yaml
       
               sharding:
                 clusterRole: configsvr
               replication:
                 replSetName: <string>
               net:
                 port: <port>
                 bindIp: localhost,<ip address>
               storage:
                 dbpath: <path>
       
            Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.
            
   .. step:: Upgrade the shards. 

      .. _7.0-upgrade-shards:

      Upgrade the shards one at a time.

      For each shard replica set:
   
      a. Upgrade the :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>` 
         members of the replica set, one at a time.
   
         i. Shut down the secondary instance.

            To shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process, use 
            :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to connect to the cluster member and 
            run the following command:

            .. code-block:: javascript

               db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

         #. Replace the |oldversion| binary with the |newversion| binary.
      
            Start the |newversion| binary with the :option:`--shardsvr
            <mongod --shardsvr>`, :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`,
            :option:`--port <mongod --port>`, and :option:`--bind_ip
            <mongod --bind_ip>` options. Include any additional command line
            options as appropriate for your deployment:

            .. code-block:: bash

               mongod --shardsvr --replSet <replSetName> --port <port> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>


            If using a :ref:`configuration file
            <configuration-options>`, update the file to
            include :setting:`sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr <sharding.clusterRole>`,
            :setting:`replication.replSetName`, :setting:`net.port`, and
            :setting:`net.bindIp`, then start the |newversion| binary:

       
            .. code-block:: yaml

               sharding:
                  clusterRole: shardsvr
               replication:
                  replSetName: <string>
               net:
                  port: <port>
                  bindIp: localhost,<ip address>
               storage:
                  dbpath: <path>

            Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.
       
         #. Wait for the member to recover to the ``SECONDARY`` state before upgrading the next secondary member. 
   
            To check the member's state, you can issue 
            :method:`rs.status()` in :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.
      
         #. Repeat for each secondary member.
      
      #. Step down the replica set primary.
   
         Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to the primary and use

         and force an election of a new primary:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            rs.stepDown()
   
      #. Upgrade the stepped-down primary.

         When :method:`rs.status()` shows that the primary has 
         stepped down and another member has assumed the ``PRIMARY`` 
         state, upgrade the stepped-down primary: 
   
         i. Shut down the stepped-down primary. 

            To shut down the stepped-down primary, use 
            :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to connect to the replica set 
            member and run the following command:

            .. code-block:: javascript

               db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )
   
         #. Replace the :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary. with the |newversion| binary.

         #. Start the |newversion| binary. 

            Start the |newversion| binary with the :option:`--shardsvr <mongod --shardsvr>`, 
            :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`,
            :option:`--port <mongod --port>`, and :option:`--bind_ip
            <mongod --bind_ip>` options. Include any additional command line
            options as appropriate for your deployment:

               mongod --shardsvr --replSet <replSetName> --port <port> --dbpath <path> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>
   
            If using a :ref:`configuration file
            <configuration-options>`, update the file to
            specify :setting:`sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr
            <sharding.clusterRole>`, :setting:`replication.replSetName`,
            :setting:`net.port`, and :setting:`net.bindIp`, then start the
            |newversion| binary:
 
            
            .. code-block:: yaml
   
               sharding:
                 clusterRole: shardsvr
               replication:
                 replSetName: <string>
               net:

               storage:
                 dbpath: <path>
   
            Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.

   .. step:: Upgrade the ``mongos`` instances. 

      .. _7.0-upgrade-mongos-instances:

      Replace each :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance with the |newversion| binary
      and restart. Include any other configuration as appropriate for your
      deployment.

      .. include:: /includes/fact-bind-ip-sharded-clusters.rst

   
      .. code-block:: bash

         mongos --configdb csReplSet/<rsconfigsver1:port1>,<rsconfigsver2:port2>,<rsconfigsver3:port3> --bind_ip localhost,<ip address>

   .. step:: Re-enable the balancer.
   
      .. _7.0-upgrade-reenable-balancer:
   
      Using :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, connect to a
      :binary:`~bin.mongos` in the cluster and run
      :method:`sh.startBalancer()` to re-enable the balancer: 

      .. code-block:: javascript
   
         sh.startBalancer()

      For more information about re-enabling the balancer, see
      :ref:`sharding-balancing-enable`.

   .. step:: Enable backwards-incompatible |newversion| features.
      
      .. _7.0-upgrade-enable-features-mongos:

      .. include:: /includes/upgrade-enable-features.rst
   
   
      .. tip::
   
         .. include:: /includes/featureCompatibility-caveat.rst
   
   
      On a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, run the
      :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command in the ``admin``
      database:
      
      .. code-block:: javascript
   
         db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "7.0" } )
   
      Setting :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion (fCV) : "7.0" <set-fcv>`
      implicitly performs a :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` on each shard to
      add the :rsconf:`term` field to the shard replica configuration
      document.

      .. include:: /includes/fCV-propagation.rst
   
      This command must perform writes to an internal system collection.
      If for any reason the command does not complete successfully, you
      can safely retry the command on the :binary:`~bin.mongos` as the
      operation is idempotent.
   
      .. note::
   
         While :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` is running on
         the sharded cluster, chunk migrations, splits, and merges
         can fail with ``ConflictingOperationInProgress``.
   
      Any :term:`orphaned documents <orphaned document>` that exist on your
      shards will be cleaned up when you set the
      :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` to |newversion|. The
      cleanup process:
   
      - Does not block the upgrade from completing, and
      - Is rate limited. To mitigate the potential effect on performance
        during orphaned document cleanup, see
        :ref:`range-deletion-performance-tuning`.
