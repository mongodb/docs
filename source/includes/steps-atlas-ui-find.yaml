   The panel displays the documents in the collection. The {+atlas-ui+} 
   limits the total byte size of documents shown per page to 800,000 
   bytes (0.8 MB). If the combined size of the first 20 documents is 
   within this limit, the {+atlas-ui+} displays all 20 documents per 
   page. Otherwise, the {+atlas-ui+} displays a single document per page.

   You can use the query bar to search for specific documents in your 
   collection. You perform the following actions with the query bar: 
   
   - Filter a query
   - Project fields to include or exclude specific fields in the query
     results
   - Sort the documents in the results
   - Apply collation to specify language-specific rules

   .. note::

      You can't skip documents and omit them from query results from the
      |service| query bar. To skip documents, use the :pipeline:`$skip`
      pipeline stage in the :ref:`aggregation pipeline
      <atlas-ui-agg-pipeline>` builder.

   Filter Query Results
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   To specify a filter condition, type a :ref:`query filter 
   <read-operations-query-argument>` into the 
   :guilabel:`Filter` field. For example, to specify an equality 
   condition, use a filter with the form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { <field1>: <value1>, ... }

   To use :ref:`query operators <query-selectors>` to specify a 
   filter condition, use a filter with the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { <field1>: { <queryoperator>: <value1> }, ... }

   .. note::

      The {+atlas-ui+} supports date queries that use the
      ``IsoDate()`` function and :manual:`MongoDB Extended JSON (v2) 
      </reference/mongodb-extended-json/>` ``$date`` data type.

   For example, the following query returns all documents where 
   the date added to a ``created_at`` field is equal to or more 
   recent than midnight on January 1, 2019, |utc| time:

   .. tabs:: 

      .. tab:: ISODate
         :tabid: isodate

         .. code-block:: javascript
            :copyable: false

            {"created_at": ISODate("2019-01-01T00:00:00.00")}

      .. tab:: Extended JSON
         :tabid: ejson

         .. code-block:: javascript
            :copyable: false
         
            { created_at: { $gte: { $date: "2019-01-01T00:00-00:00" } } }

   For more information on specifying query filters, including 
   compound conditions, see :manual:`Query Documents 
   </tutorial/query-documents>`.

   Project Fields in Query Results
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
   To specify the document fields to include or exclude in the 
   results, click :guilabel:`More Options` in the query bar and 
   specify the document fields in the :guilabel:`Project` field. 
         
   To include fields, specify the field name and set to ``1`` in 
   the project document. For example, to include the ``year`` and 
   ``name`` fields in the documents:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { year: 1, name: 1 }

   |service| returns the fields specified in the 
   :guilabel:`Project` field and the ``_id`` field, which is 
   returned unless it is explicitly excluded.

   To exclude fields, specify the field name and set to ``0`` in 
   the project document. For example, to exclude the ``year`` and 
   ``name`` fields in the documents:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { year: 0, name: 0 }

   |service| returns all fields except the fields specified in 
   :guilabel:`Project`.

   To learn more about project documents, see 
   :pipeline:`$project`.

   Sort Query Results
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To sort the order of the documents in the results, click 
   :guilabel:`More Options` in the query bar and enter the ``sort`` 
   document in the :guilabel:`Sort` field. 

   - To specify ascending order for a field, set the field to 
     ``1`` in the sort document.
   - To specify descending order for a field, set the field to 
     ``-1`` in the sort documents.

   For example, the following ``sort`` document sorts results 
   first by ``year`` in descending order, and within each year, 
   sorts by ``name`` in ascending order:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { year: -1, name: 1 }

   To learn more about sort documents, see 
   :pipeline:`$sort`.

   Specify Collation
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. include:: /includes/flex-serverless-dont-use.rst

   To specify language-specific rules for string comparison, such 
   as rules for lettercase and accent marks, click 
   :guilabel:`More Options` in the query bar and enter the collation 
   document in the :guilabel:`Collation` field. Use the 
   ``locale`` field in the collation document to specify the `ICU 
   Locale code <http://userguide.icu-project.org/locale>`__ for 
   the desired language. For example, to use the ``pinyin`` 
   variant of the Chinese collation, use the following collation 
   document:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "locale" : "zh@collation=pinyin" }

   To learn more about collation documents, see 
   :manual:`Collation </reference/collation/>`.

   .. note:: 

      As you type, the :guilabel:`Apply` button is disabled and the 
      field name in the User Interface turns red until a valid query is 
      entered.
