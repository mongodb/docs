.. versionadded:: 2.4

Overview
--------

Text search supports the search of string content in documents of a
collection. Text search introduces a new :ref:`text
<index-feature-text>` index type and a new :dbcommand:`text` command.

The text search process:

- tokenizes and stems the search term(s) during both the index creation
  and the text command execution.

- assigns a score to each document that contains the search term in the
  indexed fields. The score determines the relevance of a document to a
  given search query.

By default, :dbcommand:`text` command returns at most the top 100
matching documents as determined by the scores.

.. _create-text-index:

Create a ``text`` Index
-----------------------

To perform text search, create a ``text`` index on the field or fields
whose value is a string or an array of string elements. To create a
``text`` indexes, use the :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()` method
with a document that contains field and value pairs where the value is
the string literal ``text``.

.. important::

   - Before you can :ref:`create a text index <create-text-index>` or
     :ref:`run the text command <text-search-text-command>`, you need
     to manually enable the text search. See
     :doc:`/tutorial/enable-text-search` for information on how to
     enable the text search feature.

   - Text indexes have significant storage requirements and performance
     costs. See :ref:`text index feature <index-feature-text>` for more
     information.

The following example creates a ``text`` index on the fields
``subject`` and ``content``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex(
                              {
                                subject: "text",
                                content: "text"
                              }
                            )

This ``text`` index catalogs all string data in the ``subject`` field
and the ``content`` field, where the field value is either a string or
an array of string elements.

See :doc:`/core/text-indexes` for details on the options available when
creating ``text`` indexes.

Additionally, MongoDB permits :ref:`compound indexes
<index-type-compound>` that include ``text`` index fields in
combination with ascending/descending index fields. For more
information, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/limit-number-of-items-scanned-for-text-search`

- :doc:`/tutorial/return-text-queries-using-only-text-index`

.. _text-search-text-command:

``text`` Command
----------------

The :dbcommand:`text` command can search for words and phrases. The
command matches on the complete stemmed words. For example, if a
document field contains the word ``blueberry``, a search on the term
``blue`` will not match the document. However, a search on either
``blueberry`` or ``blueberries`` will match.

By default, the :dbcommand:`text` returns the top 100 scoring documents
in descending order, but you can specify a ``limit`` option to change
the maximum number to return.

Given a collection with a ``text`` index, use the
:method:`~db.collection.runCommand()` method to execute the
:dbcommand:`text` command, as in:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.runCommand( "text" , { search: <string> } )

For information and examples on various text search patterns, see
:doc:`/tutorial/search-for-text`.

Text Search Output
------------------

The :dbcommand:`text` command returns a document that contains the
result set.

See :ref:`text-search-output` for information on the output.
