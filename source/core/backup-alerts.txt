Backup Alerts
=============

If a problem with the MMS Backup system occurs, MMS sends an alert to
system administrators. This page describes possible alerts and provides
steps to resolve them.

Backup Agent Down
-----------------

This alert is triggered if a Backup Agent for a group with at least one
active replica set or cluster is down for more than 1 hour.

To resolve this alert:

1. Open the group in MMS by typing the group's name in the :guilabel:`GROUP` box.

2. Select the :guilabel:`Backup` tab and the :guilabel:`Backup Agents`
   page to see what server the Backup Agent is hosted on.

3. Check the Backup Agent log file on that server.

Backups Broken
--------------

If MMS On Prem Backup detects an inconsistency, the Backup state for the
replica set is marked as "broken."

To debug the inconsistency:

1. Check the corresponding Backup Agent log. If you see a "Failed Common
   Points" test, one of the following may have happened.

   - A significant rollback event occurred on the backed-up replica set.

   - The :manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>` for the backed-up
     replica set was resized or deleted.

   If either is the case, you must resync the replica set. See
   :manual:`Resync a Member of a Replica Set
   </tutorial/resync-replica-set-member>`.

2. Check the corresponding job log for an error message explaining the
problem. In MMS, click :guilabel:`Admin`, then :guilabel:`Jobs`, then the
name of the job, then :guilabel:`Logs`. Contact MongoDB Support if you
need help interpreting the error message.

Clustershot Failed
------------------

This alert is generated if MMS Backup cannot successfully take a snapshot
for a sharded cluster backup. The alert text should contain the reason for
the problem. Common problems include the following:

- There was no reachable :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos>`. To
  resolve this issue, ensure that there is at least one mongos showing in
  the MMS :guilabel:`Monitoring` tab's :guilabel:`Hosts` page.

- The :manual:`balancer </core/sharding-balancing>` could not be stopped.
  To resolve this issue, check the log files for the first :manual:`config
  server </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>` to determine why the
  balancer will not stop.

- Could not insert a token in one or more :manual:`shards
  </core/sharded-cluster-shards>`. To resolve this issue, ensure
  connectivity between the Backup Agent and all shards.

Bind Failure
------------

This alert is generated if a new replica set cannot be bound to a Backup
Daemon. The alert test should contain a reason for the problem. Common
problems include:

- No :manual:`primary </core/replica-set-primary>` is found. At the time
  the binding occurred, no primary could be detected by the Monitoring
  Agent. Ensure that the replica set is healthy.

- Not enough space is available on any Backup Daemon.

In both cases, resolve the issue and then re-initiate the initial sync.
Alternatively, the job can be manually bound through the MMS Admin
interface. In MMS, click :guilabel:`Admin` and then :guilabel:`Job Timeline`.

For information on initial sync, see :manual:`Replica Set Data
Synchronization </core/replica-set-sync>`.

Snapshot Behind Snitch
----------------------

This alert is triggered if the latest snapshot for a replica set is
significantly behind schedule. Check the job log in the MMS Admin
interface for any obvious errors. In MMS, click :guilabel:`Admin`, then
:guilabel:`Jobs`, then the name of the job, and then :guilabel:`Logs`.
