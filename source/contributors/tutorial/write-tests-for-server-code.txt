Write Tests for Server Code
===========================

.. This file needs a lot more editing

Before, during, or after making your changes to the codebase, you
should spend some time considering how to test your code to ensure
correct behavior; you must test your code to ensure correct behavior.

Sometimes, existing tests will cover everything you need to test, but
sometimes you will need to write new tests.

If you're changing existing user-facing functionality, or covering
newly discovered edge cases, you should add new JavaScript tests. If
you're changing the internal mechanics of a feature, you should add a
new C++ unit test.

Adding a New C++ Unit Test
--------------------------

A new-style C++ unit test file contains uses of the ``TEST(case_name,
test_name)`` and ``TEST_F(fixture_name, test_name)`` macros. The ``TEST``
macro constructs a single test class, containing whichever setup and
asserts you provide inside the function. ``TEST_F``, on the other hand,
constructs a test class which inherits from the base class (or
"fixture") fixture_name. Thus, one example use of ``TEST_F`` might be:

.. code-block:: cpp

   class FixtureClass : public mongo::unittest::Test {
   protected:
       int myVar;
       void setUp() { myVar = 10; }
   };

   TEST(FixtureClass, TestThatUsesFixture) {
       ASSERT_EQUALS(10, myVar);
   }

Refer to `unittest/unittest.h
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/unittest/unittest.h>`_
for a full record of all available assertions and other unit test
resources.

After writing a new C++ unit test, the next step is to declare the test
as a `SCons <http://www.scons.org/>`_ target in an SConscript file.
This is easiest to show by example:

There are multiple uses of the ``TEST``` macro in the unit test
`parsed_projection_test.cpp
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/v2.6/src/mongo/db/query/parsed_projection_test.cpp#L91>`_
found in the ``src/mongo/db/query`` subdirectory. To build 
`parsed_projection_test.cpp`_, it must be
`declared inside an SConscript file
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/v2.6/src/mongo/db/query/SConscript#L178>`_
found in the same ``src/mongo/db/query`` subdirectory.

A SConscript declaration has three parts: a ``target`` name, a ``source``
referring to the test file, and a list of ``LIBDEPS`` or library dependencies.

.. code-block:: cpp

   env.CppUnitTest(
       target="parsed_projection_test",
       source=[
           "parsed_projection_test.cpp"
       ],
       LIBDEPS=[
           "query_planner",
       ],
   )

In this case, the libdep ``"query_planner"`` is declared inside the
same SConscript file. If, instead, there is a libdep of the form
``$BUILD_DIR/mongo/bson`` or similar, that library is declared elsewhere
inside the project. For example, the bson library declaration can be
found in ``src/mongo/SConscript``.

Each library declaration includes a ``target`` (the name of the
library), a list of ``source`` files, and ``libdeps`` of its own. Put
simply, libraries provide a method of organizing and partitioning the
code base. One result is that unit tests do not require a full
recompilation to be used.

An example that contains uses of the ``TEST_F`` macro is the unit test
`collection_metadata_test.cpp
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/v2.6/src/mongo/s/collection_metadata_test.cpp#L130>`_
in the ``src/mongo/s`` directory. This unit test is declared
inside the ``src/mongo/s`` subdirectory's `SConscript file
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/v2.6/src/mongo/s/SConscript#L116>`_.

Adding a New JavaScript Test
----------------------------

JavaScript tests are written as a series of shell operations. If you
are changing any user-facing functionality, add a new JS test or edit
an existing test to confirm the correctness of your change.

Under the ``jstests`` directory, subdirectories exist with names that
categorize the tests found within the directories. The ``jstests/core``
subdirectory is for tests that are valid against any kind of
``mongodb`` server (i.e. ``mongos``/``mongod``/a replica set). The core
tests runs against those different environments. When these tests are
run, there will be a database set up for their use by the test suite.

If your test is for basic ``mongodb`` behavior, place the test in
``jstests/core``. Tests that are appropriate for replica sets only go
in ``jstests/replsets`` directory, and tests for sharded clusters go in
``jstests/sharding``. You will need to build your own replica set or
sharded cluster in the respective directories.

If your tests do not fall into one of these categories, one of the
other subdirectories may be more appropriate for your tests.

In the process of :ref:`testing-the-mongodb-server`, you may have
looked at the list of ``Smoke.py`` suites. These suites correspond to
the core tests being run with a number of different backend db
configurations. For example, with authorization, with a small oplog,
against a mongos, in parallel with each other, in a mode that
downconverts writes, etc.

Assertions 101
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When writing your JavaScript tests, use assertions to validate your
tests assumptions and invariants. These are mainly defined in `src/mongo/shell/assert.js
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/shell/assert.js>`_, though they can
be found elsewhere in the repository as well. Some examples of assertions and their usage:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Assertion
     - Usage
   * - ``assert(expression, message)``
     - Asserts that expression evaluates to a true-like value. If not, prints a stack trace and message.
   * - ``assert.eq(a, b, message)``
     - Asserts that two values are equal (tested with == and friendlyEqual)
   * - ``assert.contains(item, object, message)``
     - Asserts that item is a value in the Object (or Array).

Use the ``message`` argument in assert methods to say something about what the assertion
failure means.

General JS Test Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Do **not** use ``db`` as a variable name in JS tests. The
  :program:`mongo` shell defines a ``db`` object, and conflicts with
  your variable can be hard to diagnose.

- Do **not** introduce non-deterministic behavior into a test. We
  do not want random test failures! Be wary when testing
  against log output or features with distributed elements, like
  replSet elections.

- Do **not** assume that two things will happen immediately after each
  other. If you are using timeouts, reconsider their usage -- and even
  if you are 100% sure you need them, think again.

The Problem of Parallelization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Server tests must be able to run in parallel and still succeed. Here are some
tips to make satisfying this constraint easier:

- Try to use a unique collection name, for example one named after the
  test:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     coll = db.jstests_currentop

- If checking on current operations, make sure to add an ``ns`` filter.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.currentOp( { ns: "test.mytest" } )

- If possible, try to avoid things that are global to :program:`mongod`
  or the database (oplog, profiling, fsync)

If the test cannot be run in parallel, add it to the blacklist in
``skipTests`` in :file:`jstests/libs/parallelTester.js`.

A Note on Write Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to the 2.6 release, writes (inserts, updates, and removes) were
sent over the wire protocol to a MongoDB host as a specially formatted
message type. Those old write messages do not allow a response, and so
to detect errors JS tests must later invoke the "getLastError" (GLE)
command on the same connection/socket. GLE is still supported for
backwards compatibility, and the *compatibility* suite tests this old
framework.

Starting in 2.6, we implemented write commands. Write operations
(inserts, updates, and removes) will return a ``WriteResult`` object,
which contains any error that occurred during the write. JS tests often
consist of checking the contents of these ``WriteResult`` objects.

For example, the following operation attempts to insert a document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.coll.insert({ _id : 0, hello : "world" })

Upon successful operation, the method returns the following object:

.. code-block:: javascript

   WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })

If another operation attempts to insert a document with a duplicate
``_id``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.coll.insert({ _id : 0, hello : "world" })

The method errors and returns the following object which includes
information on the error:

.. code-block:: javascript

   WriteResult({
     "nInserted" : 0,
     "writeError" : {
       "code" : 11000,
       "errmsg" : "insertDocument :: caused by :: 11000 E11000 duplicate key error index: test.coll.$_id_  dup key: { : 0.0 }"
     }
   })

Connection errors and other basic errors that occur before the write
(such as authentication), as well as interrupted operations, are thrown
as JavaScript exceptions.

Spawning New Instances Inside a JS Test
---------------------------------------

The :program:`mongo` shell provides the following three utilities for
spawning :program:`mongod` standalone instances, replica sets, and
sharded clusters:

- `MongoRunner <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/shell/servers.js>`_,
- `ReplSetTest <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/shell/replsettest.js>`_, and
- `ShardingTest
  <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/shell/shardingtest.js>`_.

These tools spawn processes that run in the background of your
JavaScript test but will block your test script until the
:program:`mongod` instance (or replica set, or sharded cluster) is
ready to accept connections. You may then connect to a
:program:`mongos` or a :program:`mongod` from your script.

These tools obviate any need to manually start and stop potentially
complicated setups before running tests. These utilities also make
re-creating specific situations with replica sets and sharded clusters
easy to duplicate.

Similarly, 
`ToolTest <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/shell/servers_misc.js#L58-L117>`_
allows you to test MongoDB tools, such as ``mongodump`` or ``mongorestore``, from the shell.

This section will cover the basics of each utility, but for more
specific information, refer to the source code for each utility.

A great, well-commented example of a JS test using ``ReplSetTest``` is `replset1.js
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/jstests/replsets/replset1.js>`_. 
The name of the test however is an example of bad test naming; make
your test names are meaningful.

Similarly,
`cleanup_orphaned_cmd.js <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/jstests/sharding/cleanup_orphaned_cmd.js>`_
is a good example of a JS test using ``ShardingTest``.

For an example of a test that uses ``ToolTest``, see
`dumprestore2.js <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/jstests/tool/dumprestore2.js>`_.

Introduction to MongoRunner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MongoRunner`_ is a static object which manages running processes. It has five core functions:

* MongoRunner.runMongod(...)
* MongoRunner.stopMongod(...)
* MongoRunner.runMongos(...)
* MongoRunner.stopMongos(...)
* MongoRunner.runMongoTool(...)

Each of these functions takes a parameter object. All parameter fields, except certain special names,
are mapped to command line options for the mongod, mongos, and mongo tool objects that are executed.
The real utility of the MongoRunner class is the ability to **remember** and **restart** mongod and
mongos processes with the same parameters as were initially used.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var conn = MongoRunner.runMongod({ smallfiles : "", oplogSize : 40, noprealloc : "" });
   MongoRunner.stopMongod(conn);
   conn = MongoRunner.runMongod({ restart : conn });

Introduction to ReplSetTest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `ReplSetTest`_ object wraps MongoRunner to provide an easy way to spin up a replica set. A good
replica set test to use as reference is `replset1.js`_.

ReplSetTest takes two basic parameters: the name of the set and the number of nodes to create.
The third parameter, *nodeOptions*, is passed to the *MongoRunner.runMongod* call which starts
the nodes, allowing arbitary command-line options to be set. Unless you're running more than one
ReplSetTest at once, it's usually simpler to omit the "name" field and rely on the defaults.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var rst = new ReplSetTest({ nodes: 3, nodeOptions : {...} });

.. note::

   Using rs as the variable name is not recommended, since doing so will mask the replica set utility
   functions available globally under ``rs.<>``.

When the constructor returns, the set will **not** be running and will **not** be initialized. You must
perform both steps yourself using:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rst.startSet({...});
   rst.initiate();

The ``rst.startSet()`` function returns after all node mongod processes have been started and are connectable.
Options passed here are sent to the MongoRunner when starting the nodes. The ``rst.initiate()`` operation
returns immediately, but there is no guarantee that the replica set at this point has any nodes as primary
or secondary.

In order to get a connection to the replica set's primary node, we can run:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var primary = rst.getPrimary();

The primary node returned here will be a Mongo connection object. Note that the above function waits for
the primary node to be elected - if a majority of replica set members are unavailable, this function will
timeout and error. In contrast, we explicitly must wait for the rest of nodes to reach secondary state:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rst.awaitSecondaryNodes();
   var secondaries = rst.getSecondaries();

You can access nodes as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var node = rst.nodes[0];
   rst.waitForState(node, ReplicaSetTest.State.PRIMARY|SECONDARY|RECOVERING|ARBITER);

When you have finished with the replica set, stop the replica set with ``rstConn.stopSet()``.

Introduction to ShardingTest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `ShardingTest`_ object builds upon the ReplSetTest and MongoRunner abstractions to allow the creation of
a sharded cluster on the local machine with default ports and data directories. A good example of a
sharding test to use as reference is `cleanup_orphaned_cmd.js`_.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var st = new ShardingTest({
     shards : 0|1|2|3..., // the number of shards to create
     mongos : 0|1|2|3..., // the number of mongoses to create
     verbose: 0|1|2..., // the level of verbosity
     other : {
       mongosOptions : {...}, // options passed to the mongos processes
       configOptions : {...}, // options passed to the config server processes
       separateConfig : true|false, // whether to reuse the first shard as a config server
       sync : true|false, // whether we want 3 config servers or 1
       rs : true|false, // whether or not to create replica set shards
       rsOptions : {...} // options passed to the replica set objects (if replica set shards)
       shardOptions : {...}, // options passed to the shard processes (if not replica set shards)
     }
   });

The example above specifies more options than are commonly used in a given test: in many cases, only the
*shards* and *mongos* options are necessary. More options are also available -- refer to the source code
for a full accounting.

You can access connections to the initialized cluster using the following properties:

.. code-block:: javascript

   st.s0|1|2|3... // Connections to the mongos processes of the cluster, also available at st._mongos
   st.config0|1|2... // Connections to the config processes of the cluster, also available at st._configServers
   st.shard0|1|2... // Connections to (non-replica-set) shards of the cluster, also available at st._connections
   st.rs0|1|2... // ReplSetTest objects of replica set shards in the cluster, also available at st._rsObjects

There are also some specific functions to be called against the ShardingTest:

.. code-block:: javascript

   st.printShardingStatus(); // Prints status of cluster
   st.stopBalancer(); // Stops and waits for balancer to stop
   st.startBalancer(); // Starts and waits for balancer to start

Remember to stop the cluster when you are finished with it using ``st.stop()``.

Multiversion Testing with MongoRunner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoRunner can be used to write multiversion tests using a special *binVersion* parameter.
A good example of a multiversion test on which to base your own tests is `2_test_launching_cluster.js
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/jstests/multiVersion/2_test_launching_cluster.js>`_.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var mongod24 = MongoRunner.runMongod({ binVersion : "2.4" });

Under the covers, the *binVersion* parameter simply indicates to MongoRunner that it should
replace the normal executable name of "mongod" with the new name "mongod-2.4". Assuming the
appropriate executables exist on the system running multi-version tests, mongod24 will be a
connection to a mongod process running some "2.4.x" version of mongodb.

However, all of this multi-version testing fundamentally relies on simple symlinks or
executables with particular installed names. The abstractions themselves know nothing of
versions. You will need to create symlinks in your main Mongo folder to the relevant
mongo/mongod/mongos files, for example:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd  ~/mongo
   ln -s ~/mongo-2.4.6/bin/mongo mongo-2.4

If you're working on a Linux machine, you can make use of a prewritten script to setup these
symlinks, found in `buildscripts/setup_multiversion_mongodb.py
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/buildscripts/setup_multiversion_mongodb.py>`_.

Because the ReplSetTest and ShardingTest objects wrap calls to MongoRunner, and allow the
passing of arbitrary parameters to all parts of a replicated or sharded system, it is simple
to start an entire cluster at whatever version is required. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var rst = new ReplSetTest({ nodes : 3 });
   rst.startSet({ binVersion : "2.4" });

Alternatively, you may require a mixed-version cluster or replica set. To facilitate this kind
of startup, MongoRunner provides a *versionIterator* function, which returns an object that
iterates one-by-one through the version options. As an example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var version = MongoRunner.versionIterator(["2.0", "2.2"]);
   var options = {
     mongosOptions : { binVersion : version },
     configOptions : { binVersion : version },
     shardOptions : { binVersion : version },
     [rsOptions : { binVersion : version },]
     separateConfig : true,
     sync : true,
     [rs : true]
   };
   var st = new ShardingTest({ shards: 2, mongos: 2, other: options });

The resulting cluster will be composed of 1/2 v2.0 mongodb processes and 1/2 v2.2 mongodb
processes. Upgrading is just a matter of restarting mongod/s processes at a different binVersion.

.. note::

   **Warning:** The *versionIterator* works randomly, which means that you cannot rely on the
   "first" process corresponding to the "first" version you passed in.
