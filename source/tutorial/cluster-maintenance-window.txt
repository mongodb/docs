You can set the hour of the day that |service| should start weekly
maintenance on your cluster. This setting is optional and is not
required for most clusters. Configure maintenance windows from your
:ref:`project settings <project-settings>`.

Typically, you do not need to manually configure a maintenance window.
|service| performs maintenance automatically in a rolling manner
to preserve continuous availability, with the exception of a
momentary replica set election. You can use the
:ref:`Test Failover <test-failover>` capability to ensure that
your application is resilient to replica set elections.

You can also set protected hours for your project, which defines a 
daily window of time in which standard updates cannot begin within.
When configured, |service| performs standard updates that do not involve 
{+cluster+} restarts or resyncs outside of the configured daily protected hours.

Custom maintenance windows provide more control over your {+cluster+} 
performance by allowing maintenance that requires replica set elections 
to occur at your preferred time of day, and other standard updates 
to occur outside of business-critical hours.

Maintenance Window Considerations
---------------------------------

Urgent Maintenance Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| performs urgent maintenance activities such as security
patches as soon as they are needed without regard to scheduled
maintenance windows.

.. note::

   Some standard updates that don't require a 
   |mongod| restart, for example backend services updates, might also 
   occur without regard to scheduled maintenance windows.

Ongoing Maintenance Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you schedule a maintenance window for your cluster, you cannot
change it until any ongoing maintenance operations have completed.

MongoDB Database Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If maintenance includes a MongoDB version upgrade, |service|
displays the current and target versions in the console.

Maintenance Requires Replica Set Elections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| performs maintenance the same way as the maintenance
procedure described in the
:manual:`MongoDB Manual </tutorial/perform-maintence-on-replica-set-members/>`.
This procedure requires at least one
:manual:`replica set election </core/replica-set-elections>` during
the maintenance window per replica set.

Use the :ref:`Test Failover <test-failover>` capability to ensure
that your application is resilient to replica set elections.

Maintenance Starts As Close to the Hour As Possible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maintenance always begins as close to the scheduled hour as
possible, but in-progress cluster updates or unexpected system
issues could delay the start time.

Potential for Brief Performance Degradation during Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have low :ref:`Disk IOPS <disk-io-util>`, your cluster could experience 
a brief performance degradation during maintenance while MongoDB repopulates 
the WiredTiger storage engine. See 
:manual:`Journaling and the WiredTiger Storage Engine </core/journaling/#journaling-wiredTiger>` 
to learn more.

Protected Hours Considerations
------------------------------

Protected Hours Range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| can avoid performing standard updates that do not involve a {+cluster+} restart during 
user-defined daily protected hours. The length of your protected hours window cannot exceed 18 hours.

Maintenance vs. Standard Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| maintenance is automatically scheduled to occur in the maintenance window.
However, standard |service| updates may occur outside of the maintenance window, and you can
configure standard updates to also occur outside of your protected hours. 

Required Access
---------------

To manage maintenance windows, you must have 
:authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner` access 
to the project.

Procedure
---------

Open Your Project Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps-view-modify-project-settings.rst

View and Configure Maintenance Window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-maintenanceWindows-describe-and-update.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      To view and configure the maintenance window using the 
      {+atlas-ui+}:

      1. Click the :guilabel:`Set Maintenance Window` button to display the maintenance window settings.

      #. Set the day and time that you want |service| to start
         maintenance on your project.

      #. If you want |service| to automatically defer any scheduled
         maintenance for one week, click
         :guilabel:`Automatically defer maintenance for one week`.

      #. To set a range of protected hours in which |service| avoids performing
         standard updates, toggle the :guilabel:`Turn on protected hours`
         setting to :guilabel:`On`. You can set a maximum time range of 18 hours a day.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save` to keep your changes or click
         :guilabel:`Cancel` to discard them.

Clear Your Maintenance Window Configuration Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you configured a preferred maintenance window start time, you can
clear the settings using the {+atlas-cli+} or the {+atlas-ui+}. Clearing your maintenance window configuration restores the default
maintenance window settings.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-maintenanceWindows-clear.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      To clear the configured maintenance window using the 
      {+atlas-ui+}, toggle the :guilabel:`Set Maintenance Window` setting to :guilabel:`Off`.

Respond to Required Maintenance
-------------------------------

When maintenance is required, |service|:

- Displays a banner in your project's cluster list showing the date and
  time when the maintenance is scheduled.

- Sends a notification email to users with the
  :authrole:`Project Owner` role between 48 and 72 hours before the
  scheduled maintenance.

  .. note::

     To configure how you receive scheduled maintenance window
     notifications, see :ref:`configure-mw-alert`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-maintenanceWindows-defer.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      With this information, you can choose one of three options in the
      {+atlas-ui+}:

      1. Do nothing. The maintenance occurs during your scheduled
         maintenance window.

      2. Select :guilabel:`Begin Maintenance Now`. The scheduled
         maintenance starts immediately. If you choose this option,
         |service| asks you to confirm it in a separate modal.

      3. Select :guilabel:`Defer Maintenance for One Week`. The
         scheduled maintenance starts during your preferred
         maintenance window one week after the given scheduled
         maintenance date and time. If you choose this option, |service| asks you to confirm it in a separate modal.

Maintenance Version Upgrades during Maintenance Windows
-------------------------------------------------------

If |service| will upgrade the MongoDB maintenance version on one of
your clusters during the next maintenance window, the cluster's card
displays the target MongoDB maintenance version.
