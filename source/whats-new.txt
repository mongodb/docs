.. _version-4.0:

What's New in 4.0
-----------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes

   {+driver-short+} v4.0 contains breaking changes. For more information, see
   :ref:`version-4.0-breaking-changes` in the Upgrade Driver Versions guide.

The v4.0 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds a getter method for the ``start_at_operation_time`` field of a 
  ``mongocxx::options::change_stream`` instance.

.. _version-3.11:

What's New in 3.11
------------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes

   {+driver-short+} v3.11 contains breaking changes. For more information, see
   :ref:`version-3.11-breaking-changes` in the Upgrade Driver Versions guide.

The v3.11 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds support for {+mdb-server+} v8.0.
- Adds support for Queryable Encryption range queries. To use this
  feature, your app must connect to {+mdb-server+} 8.0 or later. For
  more information about Queryable Encryption, see :manual:`Queryable
  Encryption </core/queryable-encryption>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
- Adds ``empty()`` member function for ``mongocxx::v_noabi::bulk_write``.

`v3.11 Release Notes <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/releases/tag/r3.11.0>`__

.. _version-3.10:

What's New in 3.10
------------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes

   {+driver-short+} v3.10 contains breaking changes. For more information, see
   :ref:`version-3.10-breaking-changes` in the Upgrade Driver Versions guide.

The v3.10.0 driver release includes the following new features:

- Adds forward headers that provide non-defining declarations of ``bsoncxx`` and
  ``mongocxx`` class types. The driver does not support user-defined forward declarations
  of any library entity. To obtain the declaration or definition of a library entity,
  always include the corresponding header.
- The CMake option ``ENABLE_BSONCXX_USE_POLY_IMPLS`` allows selecting
  ``bsoncxx`` implementations of C++17 polyfills by default when no polyfill library is
  requested. This option is ``OFF`` by default.
- The CMake option ``BSONCXX_POLY_USE_IMPLS`` allows selecting ``bsoncxx`` implementations
  of C++17 polyfills instead of external libraries or the C++ standard library. This
  option is ``OFF`` by default.
- The ``bsoncxx::v_noabi`` and ``mongocxx::v_noabi`` namespaces are no longer declared inline.
  Root namespace declarations are still supported and expected to remain equivalent to
  their prior definitions. For example, ``bsoncxx::document`` is still equivalent to
  ``bsoncxx::v_noabi::document``, and ``mongocxx::client`` is still equivalent to
  ``mongocxx::v_noabi::client``.
- By default, when library filenames are compiled with MSVC (as detected by CMake's ``MSVC``
  variable), they are embedded with an ABI tag string. These strings are similar to
  the following:
  
  .. code-block:: bash

     bsoncxx-v_noabi-rhs-x64-v142-md.lib

  To disable this behavior, set ``ENABLE_ABI_TAG_IN_LIBRARY_FILENAMES=OFF`` as part of
  your CMake configuration.

  The ABI tag string can also be embedded in pkg-config metadata filenames, similar to the
  following:
    
  .. code-block:: bash
      
     libbsoncxx-v_noabi-rhs-x64-v142-md.pc
       
  To enable this behavior, set ``ENABLE_ABI_TAG_IN_LIBRARY_FILENAMES=ON`` and
  ``ENABLE_ABI_TAG_IN_PKGCONFIG_FILENAMES=ON`` as part of your CMake configuration.

.. _version-3.9:

What's New in 3.9
-----------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes

   {+driver-short+} v3.9 contains breaking changes. For more information, see
   :ref:`version-3.9-breaking-changes` in the Upgrade Driver Versions guide.

The v3.9 driver release includes the following new features:

- The {+driver-short+} container image is now available on
  `Docker hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver>`__.
- The driver automatically downloads the MongoDB C Driver dependency if you don't provide
  it.
- The driver no longer builds tests as part of the ``all`` target. To build tests,
  set ``BUILD_TESTING=ON`` as part of your CMake configuration.
- The driver uses the ``FetchContent`` module to download and build the
  `MNMLSTC Core <https://github.com/mnmlstc/core>`__ polyfill library, if not
  provided by the system, instead of the ``ExternalProject`` module. It also does not
  patch ``include`` directives in MNMLSTC Core headers.
- Adds the CMake option ``MONGOCXX_OVERRIDE_DEFAULT_INSTALL_PREFIX``. If this option is set to
  ``TRUE``, the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` option defaults to the build directory.
  The default value of this option is ``TRUE``.
- Adds an API for managing
  :atlas:`Atlas Search indexes </atlas-search/manage-indexes/>`.
- Adds the ``VERSIONINFO`` resource to ``bsoncxx.dll`` and ``mongocxx.dll``.
- Explicitly documents that throwing an exception from an APM callback is undefined behavior.
- Does not prematurely install MNMLSTC Core headers during the CMake build step.
- Requires that a MongoDB C Driver CMake package is found via ``find_dependency()`` for all
  installed {+driver-short+} package configurations.
