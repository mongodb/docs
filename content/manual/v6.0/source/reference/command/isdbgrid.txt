Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: isdbgrid

   This command verifies that a process is a :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

   If you issue the :dbcommand:`isdbgrid` command when connected to a
   :binary:`~bin.mongos`, the response document includes the ``isdbgrid``
   field set to ``1``. 

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
        isdbgrid: 1
      }
   )


Output
------

The returned document is similar to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "isdbgrid" : 1, "hostname" : "app.example.net", "ok" : 1 }

If you issue the :dbcommand:`isdbgrid` command when connected to a
:binary:`~bin.mongod`, MongoDB returns an error document. The
:dbcommand:`isdbgrid` command is not available to :binary:`~bin.mongod`.
The error document, however, also includes a line that reads
``"isdbgrid" : 1``, just as in the document returned for a
:binary:`~bin.mongos`. The error document is similar to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "errmsg" : "no such cmd: isdbgrid",
      "bad cmd" : {
            "isdbgrid" : 1
      },
      "ok" : 0
   }
 
You can instead use the :dbcommand:`hello` command to determine
connection to a :binary:`~bin.mongos`. When connected to a
:binary:`~bin.mongos`, the :dbcommand:`hello` command returns a document that
contains the string ``isdbgrid`` in the ``msg`` field.
