   Always refer to the official documentation of both MongoDB Atlas and 
   `Apollo Server <https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/>`__ for the
   most up-to-date and accurate information. Specific steps may vary
   depending on the details of your project and the technologies used.

`Apollo <https://www.apollographql.com/>`__ provides a `developer platform 
<https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/>`__ and open-source tools and SDKs,
including Apollo Server, to unify your data and services. Apollo Server is a
spec-compliant, production-ready server library that can use data from any
source, including MongoDB Atlas.

Migrating from MongoDB Atlas App Services to Apollo Server involves the
following steps:

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create an Apollo Server

      Apollo Server is an open-source GraphQL server that's compatible with any
      GraphQL client, including `Apollo Client <https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/>`__.

      If you are using an Express server, follow along with this tutorial on how
      to `add Apollo Server <https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/mern/>`__
      to an existing MERN stack project.

      If you are starting from scratch, follow along with the `Apollo Server 
      quickstart tutorial <https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/>`__.
      On Step 4, follow the docs for `fetching data from MongoDB 
      <https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/fetching-data/>`__.

      Be sure to update authorization and authentication. Refer to the
      `Authentication and Authorization <https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/security/authentication/>`__
      documentation for Apollo Server for details.

   .. step:: Update Client Applications

      Update any client applications that interact with your GraphQL API
      endpoints to point to the new Apollo endpoint URLs.

   .. step:: Shut Down Atlas App Services Endpoints

      Once you have verified that your GraphQL API endpoints are fully migrated
      and operational on Apollo Server, you can delete your MongoDB Atlas App
      Services app to avoid unnecessary costs. As a reminder, Atlas GraphQL
      endpoints will no longer be supported beginning September 30, 2025.
