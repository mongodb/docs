   If your source and destination clusters are running a version before 
   MongoDB 6.0, you can use legacy migration. For legacy 
   migration, you use the {+atlas-ui+} to pull a MongoDB 
   replica set or sharded cluster into an |service| replica set cluster 
   or sharded cluster. Or, you use |mms| or |onprem| to push 
   data from a source replica set or sharded cluster to a destination 
   replica set or sharded cluster in |service|. You can also use 
   self-managed tools to migrate manually, seed data, load files, or 
   import data.

This section describes legacy migration. It contains the following 
pages:

- :ref:`live-migration` 
- :ref:`migrate-from-com`
- :ref:`self-managed-migration` 
- `Migrate a MongoDB Replica Set from AWS to MongoDB Atlas on AWS 
  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/cloud/migrate-from-aws-to-atlas/>`_.
