Application Development
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB provides language-specific client libraries called
:term:`drivers <driver>` that let you develop applications to interact
with your databases.

This page lists the documents, tutorials, and reference pages that
describe application development. For API-level documentation, see
:doc:`/applications/drivers`.

For an overview of topics with which every MongoDB application
developer will want familiarity, see the :doc:`aggregation
</aggregation>` and :doc:`indexes </indexes>` documents.  For an
introduction to basic MongoDB use, see the :ref:`administration
tutorials <administration-tutorials>`.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/crud` section and the :doc:`/faq/developers`
   document. Developers should also be familiar with the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and the MongoDB :doc:`query and update
   operators </reference/operators>`.
