To read about situations in which arrays work well, see the 
following design patterns:

- Use
  `The Attribute Pattern <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-attribute-pattern>`__ for handling data 
  with unique combinations of attributes, such as movie data where each 
  movie is released in a subset of countries.

- Use
  `The Bucket Pattern <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-bucket-pattern>`__ for handling tightly 
  grouped or sequential data, such as time span data.

- Use 
  `The Polymorphic Pattern <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-polymorphic-pattern>`__ for handling 
  differently shaped documents in the same collection, such as athlete 
  records across several sports.
