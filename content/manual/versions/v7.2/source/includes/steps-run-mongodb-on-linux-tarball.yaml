title: Create the data and log directories.
ref: create-dirs
content: |

   Create a directory where the MongoDB instance stores its data. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/mongo

   Create a directory where the MongoDB instance stores its log. For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo mkdir -p /var/log/mongodb

   The user that starts the MongoDB process must have read and write
   permission to these directories. For example, if you intend to run
   MongoDB as yourself:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo chown `whoami` /var/lib/mongo     # Or substitute another user
      sudo chown `whoami` /var/log/mongodb   # Or substitute another user

title: Run MongoDB.
ref: start-mdb
content: |
   To run MongoDB, run the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process at the system prompt.

   .. code-block:: bash

      mongod --dbpath /var/lib/mongo --logpath /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log --fork

   For details on the command-line options :option:`--dbpath <mongod
   --dbpath>` and :option:`--logpath <mongod --logpath>`, see
   :ref:`mongod-options`.

title: "Verify that MongoDB has started successfully."
ref: verify
pre: |
  Verify that MongoDB has started successfully by
  checking the process output for the following line in the
  log file ``/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log``:
action:
  language: none
  copyable: false
  code: |
    [initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27017
post: |

  You may see non-critical warnings in the process
  output. As long as you see the log line shown above, you can safely
  ignore these warnings during your initial evaluation of MongoDB.

title: Begin using MongoDB.

pre: |

  Start a :binary:`~bin.mongosh` session on the same host machine as the 
  :binary:`~bin.mongod`. You can run :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
  without any command-line options to connect to a
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` that is running on your localhost with default
  port 27017.

action:
  language: shell
  code: |

     mongosh
post: |

  For more information on connecting using :binary:`~bin.mongosh`,
  such as to connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance running
  on a different host and/or port, see the
  :mongosh:`mongosh documentation </>`.

  To help you start using MongoDB, MongoDB provides :ref:`Getting
  Started Guides <getting-started>` in various driver editions. For the
  driver documentation, see :api:`Start Developing with MongoDB <>`.

replacement:
  mongod: ":binary:`~bin.mongod`"
  mongo: ":binary:`~bin.mongosh`"
