      First, shut down the :program:`mongod`, then replace these
      binaries  with the 2.4 binary and
      restart :program:`mongod`. See :ref:`terminate-mongod-processes`
      for instructions on safely terminating :program:`mongod` processes.

      character: "'"
    content: |
      Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state
      before upgrading the next secondary.

      To check the member's state, use the :method:`rs.status()`
      method in the :program:`mongo` shell.

  Use :method:`rs.stepDown()` in the :program:`mongo` shell to
  step down the :term:`primary` and force the normal :ref:`failover
  <replica-set-failover>` procedure.
action:
  language: javascript
  code:
    rs.stepDown()

  :method:`rs.stepDown()` expedites the failover procedure and is
      preferable to shutting down the primary directly.

  When :method:`rs.status()` shows that the primary has stepped down
  and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, shut down the
  previous primary and replace the :program:`mongod` binary with
  the 2.4 binary and start the new instance.
