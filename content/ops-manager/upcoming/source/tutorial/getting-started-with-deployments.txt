|onprem| is a web application that lets you create, manage, monitor and back up
MongoDB deployments. The web application
runs on the Ops Manager server, and software agents run on the
servers running MongoDB.

You can use |onprem| to create new deployments and manage existing ones. To
monitor existing deployments, you need to download |onprem| agents to the
servers in the MongoDB deployment.

|onprem| walks you through adding existing MongoDB deployments to monitor.
The choices you make during setup do not limit your choices for the future.
