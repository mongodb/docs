.. dbcommand:: listShards

   The :dbcommand:`listShards` command returns a list of the configured
   shards in a sharded cluster. :dbcommand:`listShards` is only
   available on :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances and must be issued against
   the ``admin`` database.

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
     { 
       listShards: 1 
     }
   )

Example
-------

The following operation runs :dbcommand:`listShards` against the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` ``admin`` database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({ listShards: 1 })

The following document is an example of the output from a
:dbcommand:`listShards` command:

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
    "shards": [
      {
        "_id": "shard01",
        "host": "shard01/host1:27018,host2:27018,host3:27018",
        "state": 1
      },
      {
        "_id": "shard02",
        "host": "shard02/host4:27018,host5:27018,host6:27018",
        "tags": [ "NYC" ],
        "state": 1
      },
      {
        "_id": "shard03",
        "host": "shard03/host7:27018,host8:27018,host9:27018",
        "maxSize": NumberLong("1024"),
        "state": 1
      }
    ],
    "ok": 1,
    "$clusterTime" : {
       "clusterTime" : Timestamp(1510716515, 1),
       "signature" : {
          "hash" : BinData(0,"B2ViX7XLzFLS5Fl9XEuFXbwKIM4="),
          "keyId" : NumberLong("6488045157173166092")
       }
    },
    "operationTime" : Timestamp(1510716515, 1)
  }

Output
------

:dbcommand:`listShards` returns a document that includes:

- A ``shards`` field which contains an array of documents, each
  describing one shard. Each document may contain the following fields:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 80

     * - Field
       - Description

     * - ``_id``
       - The name of the shard.

     * - ``host``
       - The hostname of the shard. If the shard is a replica set,
         ``host`` lists the hostname of each mongod instance in the
         replica set.

     * - ``draining``
       - If true, indicates that :doc:`/reference/command/removeShard`
         has been called for this shard and it is in the process of
         being drained.

     * - ``tags``
       - A list of :term:`zones <zone>` to which the shard belongs.

     * - ``maxSize``
       - The :ref:`configured <sharded-cluster-config-max-shard-size>`
         maximum storage size of the shard in megabytes. This includes
         all data files on the shard including the ``local`` and
         ``admin`` databases. If exceeded, this shard will not receive
         any more chunks.

     * - ``state``
       - An internal field used during the 
         :doc:`/reference/command/addShard` sequence to ensure that all
         steps and configuration necessary to add the shard to the
         cluster are completed.

- The ``ok`` status field, the ``operationTime`` field, and the
  ``$clusterTime`` field for the operation. For details on these
  fields, see :ref:`command-response`.
