Before you begin, learn about |multi-clusters| implementation,
:ref:`multi-cluster services and tools <multi-cluster-services-tools-ref>`,
and complete the prerequisite steps:

- :ref:`Overview <multi-cluster-quick-start-overview>`
- :ref:`Prerequisites <multi-cluster-quick-start-prereqs>`

.. note::

   The following procedure scopes your |multi-cluster| to a single
   |k8s-ns| named ``mongodb``. You can :ref:`set scope for your
   deployment <mc-namespace-scope-ref>` and use another |k8s-ns|,
   multiple, or all namespaces.

.. _multi-cluster-tls-overview:

Considerations
--------------

When you create a |multi-cluster| with the 
|k8s-op-short|, you must choose whether to encrypt connections using 
|tls| certificates.

The following procedure for :guilabel:`TLS-Encrypted` connections:

- Establishes |tls|-encrypted connections between MongoDB hosts in a
  replica set.
- Establishes |tls|-encrypted connections between client applications
  and MongoDB deployments.
- Requires valid certificates for |tls| encryption.

The following procedure for :guilabel:`Non-Encrypted Connections`:

- Doesn't encrypt connections between MongoDB hosts in a
  replica set.
- Doesn't encrypt connections between client applications
  and MongoDB deployments.
- Has fewer setup requirements than a deployment with |tls|-encrypted
  connections.

Select the appropriate tab based on whether you want to encrypt your
replica set connections with |tls|.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: TLS-Encrypted Connections
      :tabid: encrypted

      Renew TLS Certificates for a MongoDBMulti Resource
      --------------------------------------------------

      Renew your |tls| certificates periodically using
      the following procedure.
