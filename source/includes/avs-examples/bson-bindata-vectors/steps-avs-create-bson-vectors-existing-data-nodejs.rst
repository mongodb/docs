   .. step:: Fetch the data from your |service| {+cluster+}.

      a. Create a file named ``get-data.js``.

         .. code-block:: shell 

            touch get-data.js

      #. Copy and paste the following sample code to fetch the data from
         the ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`` namespace in your
         |service| {+cluster+}.

         The sample code does the following: 

         - Connects to your |service| {+cluster+} and finds documents
           with the ``summary`` field. 
         - Creates a file named ``subset.json`` to which it writes the
           data from the collection.

            .. input:: 
               :language: shell

               :language: shell 

               Subset of documents written to: ./subset.json

   .. step:: Generate the vector embeddings for your data. 

      If you already have ``float32``, ``int8``, or ``int1`` vector
      embeddings in your collection, skip this step. 

      a. Create a file named ``get-embeddings.js`` to generate ``float32``,
         ``int8``, and ``int1`` vector embeddings by using Cohere's
         ``embed`` |api|.

         .. code-block:: shell 

            touch get-embeddings.js

      #. Copy and paste the following code in the ``get-embeddings.js``
         file. 

         This code does the following:

         - Generates ``float32``, ``int8``, and ``int1`` embeddings for
           the given data by using Cohere's ``embed-english-v3.0``
           embedding model. 
         - Stores the ``float32``, ``int8``, and ``int1`` embeddings in
           fields named ``float``, ``int8``, and ``ubinary``
           respectively.
         - Creates a file named ``embeddings.json`` and saves the
           embeddings in the file.

      #. Verify the generated embeddings by opening the generated
         ``embeddings.json`` file. 

   .. step:: Convert the vector embeddings to ``binData`` vectors.

      a. Create a file named ``convert-embeddings.js`` to convert the
         ``float32``, ``int8``, and ``int1`` vector embeddings from
         Cohere to |bson| ``binData`` vectors.

         .. code-block:: shell 

            touch convert-embeddings.js

      #. Copy and paste the following code in the ``convert-embeddings.js``
         file. 

         This code does the following:

         - Generates |bson| ``binData`` vectors for the ``float32``,
           ``int8``, and ``int1`` embeddings. 
         - Appends the ``float32``, ``int8``, and ``ubinary`` |bson|
           ``binData`` vectors to the ``embeddings.json`` file.

      #. Verify the generated |bson| embeddings in the ``embeddings.json`` file.

   .. step:: Connect to the |service| {+cluster+} and upload the data to the namespace.

      a. Create a file named ``upload-data.js`` to connect to the
         |service| {+cluster+} and upload the data to the
         ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`` namespace. 

         .. code-block:: shell 

            touch upload-data.js

      #. Copy and paste the following code in the ``upload-data.js``
         file. 

         This code does the following:

         - Connects to your |service| {+cluster+} and creates a
           namespace with the database and collection name that you
           specify.  
         - Uploads the data including the embeddings into the
           ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`` namespace.

   .. step:: Create the {+avs+} index on the collection.

      a. Create a file named ``create-index.js``.

         .. code-block:: shell 

            touch create-index.js

      #. Copy and paste the following code to create the index in the
         ``create-index.js`` file.

         The code does the following:

         - Connects to the |service| {+cluster+} and creates an index
           with the specified name for the specified namespace. 
         - Indexes the ``bsonEmbeddings.float32`` and 
           ``bsonEmbeddings.int8`` fields as ``vector`` type by using
           the ``dotProduct`` similarity function, and the
