This section describes how to add servers for:

- |mms| :ref:`Monitoring <monitoring-functional-overview>`. Monitoring provides
  deployment metrics, visualization, and alerts on key database and hardware indicators.
- |mms| :ref:`Automation <automation>`. Automation lets you deploy, configure, and
  update your MongoDB processes directly from |mms|. It also provides
  all features that monitoring provides.
- :ref:`Live migration <migrate-to-atlas>` from |mms| to |service-short|.
  Use the live migration wizard in |service-short|, to move the data
  from a |mms|-managed deployment to |service-short| without having to shut
  down your |mms| deployment.
