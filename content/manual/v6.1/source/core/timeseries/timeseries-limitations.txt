This page describes limitations on using :ref:`time series collections
<manual-timeseries-collection>`.

Unsupported Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following features are not supported for time series collections:

* :atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>`
* :ref:`Change streams <changeStreams>`
* :ref:`{+csfle+} <manual-csfle-feature>`
* :realm:`Database Triggers </triggers/database-triggers>`
* :realm:`GraphQL API </graphql>`
* :ref:`Schema validation rules <schema-validation-overview>`
* :dbcommand:`reIndex`
* :dbcommand:`renameCollection`

:realm:`Atlas Device Sync </sync>` is only supported if the time series
collections are asymmetrically synchronized. For details, see
:realm:`Enable Atlas Device Sync </sync/configure/enable-sync>`.

Aggregation $out and $merge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot use the :pipeline:`$out` or :pipeline:`$merge` aggregation
pipeline stages to add data from another collection to a time series
collection.

.. _timeseries-limitations-updates-deletes:

Updates and Deletes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, you can perform some delete and update
operations.

Delete commands must meet the following requirements:

- You can only match on :ref:`metaField <time-series-fields>` field
  values.
- Your delete command must not limit the number of documents to be
  deleted. Set ``justOne: false`` or use the
  :method:`~db.collection.deleteMany()` method.

Update commands must meet the following requirements:

.. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-update-limitations.rst

In MongoDB 5.0, time series collections only support insert operations
and read queries. Updates and manual delete operations result in an
error.

To automatically delete old data, :ref:`set up automatic removal (TTL)
<set-up-automatic-removal>`.

To remove all documents from a collection, use the
:method:`~db.collection.drop()` method to drop the collection.

.. _timeseries-limitations-secondary-indexes:

Time Series Secondary Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is improved support for secondary indexes in MongoDB 6.0.

Time Series Secondary Indexes with MongoDB 6.0 and Later
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can add a :term:`secondary index <secondary
index>` to any field.

These index types aren't supported:

- :ref:`Text indexes <index-feature-text>`
- :ref:`2d indexes <2d-index>`
- :ref:`Unique indexes <index-type-unique>`

The :ref:`TTL <index-feature-ttl>` index property is not supported. For
TTL deletion, use :ref:`expireAfterSeconds
<db.createCollection.expireAfterSeconds>`.

You can only use the :ref:`multikey index <index-type-multikey>` type on
the ``metaField``.

These index properties are partially supported. You can create:

- :ref:`partial indexes <index-type-partial>` on every field except
  ``metaField`` and ``timeField``.
- :ref:`sparse indexes <index-type-sparse>` on the ``metaField``.

For improvements to time series secondary indexes available starting in
MongoDB 6.0, see :ref:`timeseries-add-secondary-index-mongodb-6.0`.

.. include:: /includes/time-series-secondary-indexes-downgrade-FCV.rst

Time Series Secondary Indexes with MongoDB 5.0 and Earlier
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

In MongoDB 5.0 and earlier:

- The ``metaField`` can have secondary indexes.
- The ``timeField``  can have secondary indexes.
- If the ``metaField`` is a document, you can add secondary indexes on
  fields inside the document.

   :ref:`indexes`

Capped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot create a time series collection as a :ref:`capped collection
<manual-capped-collection>`.

Modification of Collection Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only set the collection type when you create a collection:

- An existing collection cannot be converted into a time series
  collection.
- A time series collection cannot be converted into a different
  collection type.

To move data from an existing collection to a time series collection,
:ref:`migrate data into a time series collection
<migrate-data-into-a-timeseries-collection>`.

Modification of ``timeField`` and ``metaField``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only set a collection's ``timeField`` and ``metaField``
parameters when you create the collection. You cannot modify these
parameters later.

.. _timeseries-limitations-granularity:

Modification of ``granularity``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you set the ``granularity``, you can only increase it one level at
a time. The ``granularity`` can change from ``"seconds"`` to
``"minutes"`` or from ``"minutes"`` to ``"hours"``. Other changes are
not allowed. 

To change the ``granularity`` from ``"seconds"`` to ``"hours"``, first
increase the ``granularity`` to ``"minutes"`` and then to ``"hours"``.

.. _time-series-limitations-sharding:

Sharding
~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1 (and 5.0.6), you can create sharded time series
collections.

In versions earlier than MongoDB 5.0.6, you cannot shard time series
collections.

Sharding Administration Commands
````````````````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 5.2 (and 5.1.2, 5.0.6), you can run :ref:`sharding
administration commands <db-commands-sharding>` (such as
:dbcommand:`moveChunk`) on the ``system.buckets`` collection.

In versions earlier than MongoDB 5.0.6, you cannot run sharding
administration commands for sharded time series collections.

Shard Key Fields
````````````````

.. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-shard-key-limitations.rst

Resharding
``````````

You cannot reshard sharded time series collections.

Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot write to time series collections in :ref:`transactions
<transactions>`.

.. note::

  Reads from time series collections are supported in transactions.

Views
~~~~~

- Time series collections are writable non-materialized :ref:`views
  <views-landing-page>`. Limitations for views apply to time series
  collections.

- You cannot create a view from a time series bucket collection
  namespace (namely, a collection prefixed with ``system.buckets``).
