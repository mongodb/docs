The :guilabel:`Authentication` tab allows you to connect to deployments that 
require authentication. To learn about authentication mechanisms within MongoDB,
see :manual:`Authentication Mechanisms </core/authentication/#authentication-mechanisms>`.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Advanced Connection Options`.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/advanced-connection-options.png
         :figwidth: 690px
         :alt: New Advanced Connection Options

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Authentication` tab.

      Select your authentication method from the following options: 
      
      - :ref:`Username / Password <username-password>`
      
      - :ref:`X.509 <x509>`
      
      - :ref:`Kerberos <kerberos-authentication>`
      
      - :ref:`LDAP <ldap-authentication>`
      
      - :ref:`AWS IAM <aws-iam-authentication>`

      .. _username-password:

      Username / Password 
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Provide the following information:

      - Username

      - Password

      - (Optional) :manual:`Authentication Database </core/security-users/#authentication-database>`

      - Authentication Mechancism:
         
        - Default

          |

          The ``Default`` setting selects the first authentication mechanism 
          supported by the server according to an order of preference. 
          
          |

          With the ``Default`` setting, MongoDB tries to authenticate using
          the following mechanisms in the order they are listed:

          1. ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
          
          #. ``SCRAM-SHA-1``

          #. ``MONGODB-CR``
          
          |

        - :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-1 </core/security-scram/>`

        - :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-256 </core/security-scram/>`

      .. _x509:

      X.509
      ~~~~~

      Select :guilabel:`X.509` if the deployment uses :manual:`X.509 
      </core/security-x.509/>` as its authentication mechanism.

      .. note:: 

         X.509 Authentication requires a client certificate. To enable 
         TLS and add a client certificate, see the :ref:`TLS / SSL tab <tls-ssl-tab>`
         in |compass-short|.

      .. _kerberos-authentication:

      Kerberos
      ~~~~~~~~

      Select :guilabel:`Kerberos` if the deployment uses :manual:`Kerberos 
      </core/kerberos/>` as its authentication mechanism. 

      Provide the following information:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 50, 50

         * - Field
           - Description

         * - Principal
           - Every participant in the authenticated communication is known as a 
             "principal", and every principal must have a unique name. 

         * - (Optional) Service Name
           - Every MongoDB :binary:`mongod` and :binary:`mongos` instance 
             (or exe or exe on Windows) must have an associated service name. The 
             default is ``mongodb``. 

         * - (Optional) Canonicalize Host Name
           - Kerberos uses the canonicalized form of the host name ``(cname)`` 
             when constructing the principal for |compass|. 

         * - (Optional) Service Realm 
           - The service realm is the domain over which a Kerberos authentication 
             server has the authority to authenticate a user.

             If you choose to :guilabel:`Canonicalize Host Name`, you can specify 
             one of the following options:

             .. list-table::
                :header-rows: 1
                :widths: 50 50

                * - Option
                  - Description 

                * - Forward
                  - The driver does a ``cname`` lookup on the kerberos hostname.

                * - Forward and Reverse
                  - Performs a forward DNS lookup and then a reverse lookup on that 
                    value to canonicalize the hostname.
                    
             For more information on principal name canonicalization in Kerberos, see 
             this `RFC document <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6806.html>`__.
      
         * - (Optional) Provide password directly
           - Used to verify your identity. 

      .. _ldap-authentication:

      LDAP
      ~~~~

      Select :guilabel:`LDAP` if the deployment uses :manual:`LDAP 
      </core/security-ldap-external/>` as its authentication mechanism. 

      Provide the following information:

      - Username

      - Password

      .. _aws-iam-authentication:

      AWS IAM  
      ~~~~~~~

      Select :guilabel:`AWS IAM` if the deployment uses `AWS IAM 
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html>`__ as 
      its authentication mechanism. 
      
      The following fields are optional as they can be defined on your platform 
      using their respective AWS IAM environment variables. |compass| will 
      use these environment variable values to authenticate; you do not 
      need to specify them in the connection string.

      - (Optional) AWS Access Key Id
      
      - (Optional) AWS Secret Access Key 

      - (Optional) AWS Session Token

   .. step:: (Optional) For advanced connection configuration options, click the :ref:`Advanced <advanced-connection-tab>` tab.

   .. step:: Click Connect.

.. seealso::

   To disconnect from your deployment, see :ref:`<disconnect-tab>`.
