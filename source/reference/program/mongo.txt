:program:`mongo` is an interactive JavaScript shell interface to
MongoDB, which provides a powerful interface for systems
administrators as well as a way for developers to test queries and
operations directly with the database. :program:`mongo` also provides
a fully functional JavaScript environment for use with a MongoDB. This
document addresses the basic invocation of the :program:`mongo` shell
and an overview of its usage.

Files
-----

.. _mongo-dbshell-file:

:file:`~/.dbshell`
   :program:`mongo` maintains a history of commands in the :file:`.dbshell`
   file.

   .. note::

      :program:`mongo` does not recorded interaction related to
      authentication in the history file, including
      :dbcommand:`authenticate` and :method:`db.addUser()`.

   .. warning::

      Versions of Windows :program:`mongo.exe` earlier than 2.2.0 will
      save the `.dbshell` file in the :program:`mongo.exe` working
      directory.

.. _mongo-mongorc-file:

:file:`~/.mongorc.js`
   :program:`mongo` will read the ``.mongorc.js`` file from the home
   directory of the user invoking :program:`mongo`. In the file, users
   can define variables, customize the :program:`mongo` shell prompt,
   or update information that they would like updated every time they
   launch a shell. If you use the shell to evaluate a JavaScript file
   or expression either on the command line with :option:`--eval` or
   by specifying :ref:`a .js file to mongo <mongo-shell-file>`,
   :program:`mongo` will read the ``.mongorc.js`` file *after* the
   JavaScript has finished processing.

   Specify the :option:`--norc` option to disable
   reading ``.mongorc.js``.

.. _mongo-global-mongorc-file:

:file:`/etc/mongorc.js`
   Global ``mongorc.js`` file which the :program:`mongo` shell
   evaluates upon start-up. If a user also has a :file:`.mongorc.js`
   file located in the :envvar:`HOME` directory, the :program:`mongo`
   shell evaluates the global :file:`/etc/mongorc.js` file *before*
   evaluating the user's :file:`.mongorc.js` file.

   :file:`/etc/mongorc.js` must have read permission for the user
   running the shell. The :option:`--norc` option for :program:`mongo`
   suppresses only the user's :file:`.mongorc.js` file.

   On Windows, the global :file:`mongorc.js </etc/mongorc.js>` exists
   in the :file:`%ProgramData%\\MongoDB` directory.

:file:`/tmp/mongo_edit{<time_t>}.js`
   Created by :program:`mongo` when editing a file. If the file exists,
   :program:`mongo` will append an integer from ``1`` to ``10`` to the
   time value to attempt to create a unique file.

:file:`%TEMP%\mongo_edit{<time_t>}.js`
   Created by :program:`mongo.exe` on Windows when editing a file. If
   the file exists, :program:`mongo` will append an integer from ``1``
   to ``10`` to the time value to attempt to create a unique file.


Environment
-----------

.. envvar:: EDITOR

   Specifies the path to an editor to use with the ``edit`` shell
   command.  A JavaScript variable ``EDITOR`` will override the value of
   :envvar:`EDITOR`.

.. envvar:: HOME

   Specifies the path to the home directory where :program:`mongo` will
   read the :file:`.mongorc.js` file and write the :file:`.dbshell`
   file.

.. envvar:: HOMEDRIVE

   On Windows systems, :envvar:`HOMEDRIVE` specifies the path the
   directory where :program:`mongo` will read the :file:`.mongorc.js`
   file and write the :file:`.dbshell` file.

.. envvar:: HOMEPATH

   Specifies the Windows path to the home directory where
   :program:`mongo` will read the :file:`.mongorc.js` file and write
   the :file:`.dbshell` file.

.. [#multiple-bindings] MongoDB accommodates multiple keybinding.
   Since 2.0, :program:`mongo` includes support for basic emacs
   keybindings.

.. _mongo-usage-examples:

Use
---

Typically users invoke the shell with the :program:`mongo` command at
the system prompt. Consider the following examples for other
scenarios.

To connect to a database on a remote host using authentication and a
non-standard port, use the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --username <user> --password <pass> --host <host> --port 28015

Alternatively, consider the following short form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo -u <user> -p <pass> --host <host> --port 28015

Replace ``<user>``, ``<pass>``, and ``<host>`` with the appropriate
values for your situation and substitute or omit the :option:`--port`
as needed.

To execute a JavaScript file without evaluating the :file:`~/.mongorc.js`
file before starting a shell session, use the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --shell --norc alternate-environment.js

To execute a JavaScript file with authentication, with password prompted
rather than provided on the command-line, use the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo script-file.js -u <user> -p

To print return a query as :term:`JSON`, from the system prompt using
the :option:`--eval <mongo --eval>` option, use the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --eval 'db.collection.find().forEach(printjson)'

Use single quotes (e.g. ``'``) to enclose the JavaScript, as well as
the additional JavaScript required to generate this output.
