Solution Overview 
-----------------

Customer satisfaction is critical for insurance companies. Studies have
shown that companies with superior customer experiences consistently
outperform their peers. In fact, McKinsey found that life and
property/casualty insurers with superior customer experiences saw a
significant `20% and 65% increase
<https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/insurance/elevating-customer-experience-a-win-win-for-insurers-and-customers>`__
in total shareholder return, respectively, over five years. 

A satisfied customer is a loyal customer. They are `80% more likely
<https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-growth-engine-superior-customer-experience-in-insurance>`__
to renew their policies, directly contributing to sustainable growth.
However, one major challenge faced by many insurance companies is the
inefficiency of their call centers. Agents often struggle to quickly
locate and deliver accurate information to customers, leading to
frustration and dissatisfaction.

This solution illustrates how MongoDB can transform call center
operations. By converting call recordings into searchable vectors
(numerical representations of data points in a multi-dimensional space),
businesses can quickly access relevant information and improve customer
service. We'll dig into how the integration of Amazon Transcribe,
Cohere, and MongoDB Atlas Vector Search is achieving this
transformation.

Customer service interactions are goldmines of valuable insights. By
analyzing call recordings, we can identify successful resolution
strategies and uncover frequently asked questions. In turn, by making
this information—which is often buried in audio files— accessible to
agents, it can give customers faster and more accurate assistance.

However, the vast volume and unstructured nature of these audio files
make it challenging to extract actionable information efficiently.

To address this challenge, we propose a pipeline that leverages AI and
analytics to transform raw audio recordings into into vectors as shown
in Figure 1: 

- Storage of raw audio files: Past call recordings are stored in their
  original audio format.

- Processing of the audio files with AI and analytics services (such as
  `Amazon Transcribe Call Analytics
  <https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/call-analytics/>`__):
  Speech-to-text conversion, summarization of content, and
  vectorization.

- Storage of vectors and metadata: The generated vectors and associated
  metadata (e.g., call timestamps, agent information) are stored in an
  operational data store.

Once the data is stored in vector format within the operational data
store, it becomes accessible for real-time applications. This data can
be consumed directly through vector search or integrated into a
`retrieval-augmented generation
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/artificial-intelligence/retrieval-augmented-generation>`__
(RAG) architecture, a technique that combines the capabilities of `large
language models
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/artificial-intelligence/large-language-models>`__
(LLMs) with external knowledge sources to generate more accurate and
informative outputs.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

With MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we’ve looked at the components of the pre-processing pipeline,
let’s explore the proposed real-time system architecture in detail. It
comprises the following modules and functions (see Figure 2):


- `Amazon Transcribe <https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/>`__, which
  receives the audio coming from the customer’s
  phone and converts it into text.

- `Cohere’s <https://cohere.com/>`__ embedding model, served through
  `Amazon Bedrock <https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/>`__, vectorizes the
  text coming from Transcribe.

- `MongoDB Atlas Vector Search
  <https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search>`__
  receives the query vector and returns a document that contains the
  most semantically similar FAQ in the database.

Key Learnings
-------------

- Integrating AI services (speech-to-text, vector embeddings, vector
  search) with MongoDB Atlas can transform traditional call centers by
  making historical voice data instantly searchable and actionable.

- A RAG-based architecture combined with vector search provides a
  foundation for both immediate wins (faster agent responses) and future
  opportunities (chatbots, automated workflows), making it a strategic
  investment for customer service operations.

- Implementing real-time agent assistance can directly impact key
  business metrics—from improved customer satisfaction and loyalty (`80%
  higher renewal rates
  <https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-growth-engine-superior-customer-experience-in-insurance>`__)
  to significant financial returns (`20-65% increase in total
  shareholder return for insurers
  <https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/insurance/elevating-customer-experience-a-win-win-for-insurers-and-customers>`__).

The proposed architecture is simple but very powerful, easy to
implement, and effective. Moreover, it can serve as a foundation for
more advanced use cases that require complex interactions, such as
agentic workflows, and iterative and multi-step processes that combine
LLMs and `hybrid search
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/tutorials/reciprocal-rank-fusion/>`__
to complete sophisticated tasks.

This solution not only impacts human operator workflows but can also
underpin chatbots and voicebots, enabling them to provide more relevant
and contextual customer responses.
