Access ``All Clusters`` View
----------------------------

Access the :guilabel:`All Clusters` view by clicking the
:guilabel:`All Clusters` link at the top of |service|.

In the search box, you can enter the :ref:`organization name
<organizations>`, :ref:`project name <projects>`, or cluster name to
search for specific organizations, projects, or clusters.

You can also use the dropdowns to filter the displayed list by
:guilabel:`Availability`, cluster :guilabel:`Type`, MongoDB
:guilabel:`Version`, and :guilabel:`Configuration` settings.

.. note::

   By default, clusters without any contact with |service| for the last
   6 months are not displayed. To display these clusters, click
   :guilabel:`Show Inactive Clusters`.

The view displays the following information for the cluster:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field

The Cluster Detail view displays the clusters by
:ref:`Project <projects>`.

Access the Cluster Detail view by either selecting a
:doc:`project </tutorial/manage-projects>` from the
:guilabel:`All Clusters` view, or selecting the
desired project from the :guilabel:`Context` dropdown
in the left navigation.

This view displays the following information for the
clusters in the selected project:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

This view also displays the following high-level
:doc:`metrics </monitor-cluster-metrics/>` for each cluster:

- Read / write operations per second.

- Number of open connections to the cluster.

- Logical size of cluster data.

- Cluster disk |iops| (*Available on M10+ clusters*).

.. note::

   |service| pauses monitoring for these metrics on ``M0`` Free Tier
   clusters which have had no connection activity for 7 days.
   |service| notifies you of clusters in this state in the
   Cluster Detail view and shows limited details for these clusters.
   Monitoring resumes once a successful connection occurs through
   the |service| |api|, :doc:`Driver </driver-connection>`,
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, or
   :doc:`Data Explorer </data-explorer>`.
