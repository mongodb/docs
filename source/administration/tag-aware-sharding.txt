==================
Tag Aware Sharding
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

For sharded clusters, MongoDB makes it possible to associate specific
ranges of a :term:`shard key` with a specific :term:`shard` or subset
of shards. This association dictates the policy of the cluster
balancer process as it balances the :term:`chunks <chunk>` around the
cluster. This capability enables the following deployment patterns:

- isolating a specific subset of data on specific set of shards.

- controlling the balancing policy so that in a geographically
  distributed cluster the most relevant portions of the data set
  reside on the shards with greatest proximity to the application
  servers.

This document describes the behavior, operation, and use of tag aware
sharding in MongoDB deployments.

.. note::

   Shard key range tags are entirely distinct from :ref:`replica set member
   tags <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`.

Tag-aware sharding cannot be used with :term:`hashed shard keys <hashed shard key>`.

Behavior and Operations
-----------------------

Tags in a sharded cluster are pieces of metadata that dictate the
policy and behavior of the cluster :term:`balancer`. Using
tags, you may associate individual shards in a cluster with one or
more tags. Then, you can assign this tag string to a range
of :term:`shard key` values for a sharded collection. When migrating a
chunk, the balancer will select a destination shard based on the
configured tag ranges.

The balancer migrates chunks in tagged ranges to shards with those
tags, if tagged shards are not balanced. [#specific-tagged-migrations]_

.. note::

   Because a single chunk may span different tagged shard key ranges,
   the balancer may migrate chunks to tagged shards that contain
   values that exceed the upper bound of the selected tag range.

.. example::

   Given a sharded collection with two configured tag ranges, such
   that:

   - :term:`Shard key` values between ``100`` and ``200`` have tags to
     direct corresponding chunks to shards tagged ``NYC``.

   - Shard Key values between ``200`` and ``300`` have tags to direct
     corresponding chunks to shards tagged ``SFO``.

   In this cluster, the balancer will migrate a chunk with shard key
   values ranging between ``150`` and ``220`` to a shard tagged
   ``NYC``, since ``150`` is closer to ``200`` than ``300``.

After configuring tags on shards and ranges of the shard key, the
cluster may take some time to reach the proper distribution of data,
depending on the division of chunks (i.e. splits) and the current
distribution of data in the cluster. Once configured, the balancer
will respect tag ranges during future :ref:`balancing rounds
<sharding-internals-balancing>`.

.. [#specific-tagged-migrations] To migrate chunks in a tagged
   environment, the balancer selects a target shard with a tag range
   that has an *upper* bound that is *greater than* the migrating
   chunk's *lower* bound. If a shard with a matching tagged range
   exists, the balancer will migrate the chunk to that shard.



Administer Shard Tags
---------------------

Associate tags with a particular shard using the
:method:`sh.addShardTag()` method when connected to a
:program:`mongos` instance. A single shard may have multiple tags, and
multiple shards may also have the same tag.

.. example::

   The following example adds the tag ``NYC`` to two shards, and the tags
   ``SFO`` and ``NRT`` to a third shard:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.addShardTag("shard0000", "NYC")
      sh.addShardTag("shard0001", "NYC")
      sh.addShardTag("shard0002", "SFO")
      sh.addShardTag("shard0002", "NRT")

You may remove tags from a particular shard using the
:method:`sh.removeShardTag()` method when connected to a
:program:`mongos` instance, as in the following example, which removes
the ``NRT`` tag from a shard:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.removeShardTag("shard0002", "NRT")

Tag a Shard Key Range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To assign a tag to a range of shard keys use the
:method:`sh.addTagRange()` method when connected to a
:program:`mongos` instance. Any given shard key range may only have
*one* assigned tag. You cannot overlap defined ranges, or tag the same
range more than once.

.. example::

   Given a collection named ``users`` in the ``records`` database,
   sharded by the ``zipcode`` field. The following operations assign:

   - two ranges of zip codes in Manhattan and Brooklyn the ``NYC`` tag

   - one range of zip codes in San Francisco the ``SFO`` tag

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.addTagRange("records.users", { zipcode: "10001" }, { zipcode: "10281" }, "NYC")
      sh.addTagRange("records.users", { zipcode: "11201" }, { zipcode: "11240" }, "NYC")
      sh.addTagRange("records.users", { zipcode: "94102" }, { zipcode: "94135" }, "SFO")

.. note::

   Shard rages are always inclusive of the lower value and exclusive
   of the upper boundary.

Remove a Tag From a Shard Key Range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :program:`mongod` does not provide a helper for removing a tag
range. You may delete tag assignment from a shard key range by removing
the corresponding document from the :data:`~config.tags` collection of
the ``config`` database.

Each document in the :data:`~config.tags` holds the :term:`namespace`
of the sharded collection and a minimum shard key value.

.. example::

   The following example removes the ``NYC`` tag assignment for the
   range of zip codes within Manhattan:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config
      db.tags.remove({ _id: { ns: "records.users", min: { zipcode: "10001" }}, tag: "NYC" })

View Existing Shard Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The output from :method:`sh.status()` lists tags associated with a
shard, if any, for each shard. A shard's tags exist in the shard's
document in the :data:`~config.shards` collection of the ``config``
database. To return all shards with a specific tag, use a sequence of
operations that resemble the following, which will return only those
shards tagged with ``NYC``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use config
   db.shards.find({ tags: "NYC" })

You can find tag ranges for all :term:`namespaces <namespace>` in the
:data:`~config.tags` collection of the ``config`` database. The output
of :method:`sh.status()` displays all tag ranges. To return all shard
key ranges tagged with ``NYC``, use the following sequence of
operations:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use config
   db.tags.find({ tags: "NYC" })
