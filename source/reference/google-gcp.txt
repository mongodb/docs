Synopsis
--------

|service| supports deploying clusters onto Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This
page provides reference material related to |service| cluster deployments on
:abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud Platform)`.

|service| supports the following :abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud Platform)` regions:

Instance Configuration Options
------------------------------

Each |service| instance size comes with a default set of resources. |service|
provides the following resource configuration options:

Custom Storage Size
   The size of the server root volume. |service| clusters deployed onto
   :abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud Platform)` use SSD persistent
   storage [#google-disk-docs]_.
   
   The minimum custom storage size for all instances is ``10GB``.

   For ``M10`` instances, the maximum custom storage size is ``3TB``.

   For ``M20+`` instances, the maximum custom storage size is ``4TB``.
   
   Workloads typically require less than ``2TB``.

|service| configures the following resources automatically and does not allow
user modification:

Storage Speed
   The input/output operations per second (IOPS) [#google-disk-docs]_ the
   system can perform. This value is fixed at 30
   :abbr:`IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second)` per GB
   for reads and 30 :abbr:`IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second)` per GB 
   for writes.
   
   .. example::
   
      The ``M30`` instance size has a default storage size of 40GB per
      instance and a max storage speed of 1200 max :abbr:`IOPS (Input/Output
      Operations per Second)`. Increasing the storage size to 100GB per
      instance increases the max storage speed to ``( 30 IOPS / GB * 100 GB)``
      or 3000 :abbr:`IOPS (Input/Output Operations per Second)`.

Encrypted Storage Volumes
   :abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud Platform)` storage volumes are
   `always encrypted <https://cloud.google.com/security/encryption-at-rest/>`_.

.. _google-gcp-availability-zones:

GCP Zones
---------

Each :abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud Platform)` region includes a set number of
independent zones. Each zone has power, cooling, networking, and control
planes that are isolated from other zones. For regions that have at least
three zones (3Z), |service| deploys clusters across three zones. For regions
that only have two zones (2Z), |service| deploys clusters across two zones.

The |service| :doc:`Add New Cluster </create-new-cluster>` form marks regions
that support :abbr:`3Z (Three Zone)` clusters as :guilabel:`Recommended`, as
they provide higher availability.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-no-node-restriction-gcp.rst

For general information on :abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud Platform)` regions
and zones, see the Google documentation on `regions and zones
<https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/regions-zones>`_

Regions with at Least Three Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the selected :abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud Platform)` region has at least three
zones, |service| clusters are split across three zones. For example, a three
node replica set cluster would have one node deployed onto each zone.

.. include:: /images/google-gcp-3az.rst

:abbr:`3Z (Three Zone)` clusters have higher availability
compared to :abbr:`2Z (Two Zone)` clusters. However, not all
regions support :abbr:`3Z (Three Zone)` clusters.

.. 
   Regions with Only Two Zones
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   If the selected :abbr:`GCP (Google Cloud Platform)` region has two zones,
   |service| clusters are split across the two zones. For example, a three node
   replica set cluster would have two nodes deployed to one zone and the
   remaining node deployed to the other zone.

   .. include:: /images/google-gcp-2az.rst

   :abbr:`2Z (Two Zone)` clusters have a higher chance of loss of
   availability in the event of the loss of an zone than :abbr:`3Z
   (Three Zone)` clusters. However, where latency or location are a
   priority, a region that supports :abbr:`2Z (Two Zone)` clusters
   may be preferred.
