View and analyze performance metrics
====================================

The AKO binary exposes standard controller-runtime metrics on http://localhost:8080/metrics. 
There, you can find the following:

- Total number of reconciliation errors and successful reconciles per controller.
- Length of reconcile queues per controller.
- Reconciliation latency.
- Standard resource metrics such as CPU, memory usage, and file descriptor usage.
- Go runtime metrics such as the number of Go routines and GC duration.

To learn more, see `Controller Metrics <https://book-v1.book.kubebuilder.io/beyond_basics/controller_metrics>`__.

Resource Stuck in Reconciliation
--------------------------------

Problem: Resource stuck in reconciliation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This problem occurs when the ``AtlasProject`` resource is not in a ``Ready`` state. 
It can occur with every |ak8so| resource type.

Symptoms
`````````

- The resource is not in a ``Ready`` state.
- A high error rate.
  
To monitor the error rate, you can create a query to calculate the 
reconciliation error rate for the ``AtlasProject`` controller as a percentage 
over the last minute. This metric helps in identifying and monitoring the 
health and stability of the ``AtlasProject`` controller. A high or rising 
error percentage indicates issues in the reconciliation process.

Example Query
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To calculate the error rate, use the following `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/>`__ query:

.. code-block:: prometheus

   100 * rate(controller_runtime_reconcile_errors_total{controller="AtlasProject"}[1m]) / rate(controller_runtime_reconcile_total{controller="AtlasProject"}[1m])

Status
```````

Check the resource status condition for further details:

.. code-block:: yaml

   status:
     conditions:
       - type: Ready
         status: "False"
         reason: ....

Action Items
````````````

1. **Verify Resource Status:**
   
   - Check the status condition message for more detailed information.
   - If the ``AtlasProject`` is not ready, proceed with the next troubleshooting steps.
  
2. **Check Connection Secret:**
   
   - Ensure the connection secret referenced by ``spec.connectionSecretRef.name`` is correctly labeled with ``atlas.mongodb.com/type=credentials``.

3. **Investigate Logs:**
   
   - Review logs for the ``AtlasProject`` controller for any potential errors or failed reconciliation attempts.
