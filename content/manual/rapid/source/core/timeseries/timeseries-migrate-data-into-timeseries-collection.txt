   :description: Migrate data into a time series collection using aggregation pipelines, database tools, or relational migrator for improved performance and storage.

If your collection stores data that you want to compare across time intervals,
use a time series collection to improve performance and storage. For more
information on the benefits of time series collections, see
:ref:`manual-timeseries-collection`. 

You can use the following methods to
migrate data from an existing collection into a :ref:`time series collection
<manual-timeseries-collection>`:

- :ref:`Migrate with an Aggregation Pipeline <migrate-data-into-a-timeseries-collection-with-aggregation>`
- :ref:`Migrate with Database Tools <migrate-data-into-a-timeseries-collection-with-tools>`
- `Migrate with Relational Migrator <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/relational-migrator/mapping-rules/mapping-rule-options/time-series/>`__

Considerations
--------------

If you use MongoDB 7.0 or greater and already have your data in a MongoDB
database, migrate with an :ref:`aggregation pipeline
<migrate-data-into-a-timeseries-collection-with-aggregation>`. 

If your data is in a relational database, use `Relational Migrator
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/relational-migrator/mapping-rules/mapping-rule-options/time-series/>`__
to migrate your data into a time series collection. 

If your deployment is not in one of those cases, use :ref:`Database Tools
<migrate-data-into-a-timeseries-collection-with-tools>` to migrate your data.
