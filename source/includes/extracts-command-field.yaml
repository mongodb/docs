  A document containing the full command object associated with this
  operation. If the command document exceeds {{truncThreshold}}, the
  value is a string summary of the object. If the string summary
  exceeds {{truncThreshold}}, the string summary is truncated, denoted
  with an ellipsis (...) at the end of the string.
  
  The following example output contains the command object for a
  :doc:`find </reference/method/db.collection.find/#db.collection.find>`
  operation on a collection named ``items`` in a database
  named ``test``:
  
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     "command" : {
       "find" : "items",
       "filter" : {
         "sku" : 1403978
       },
       "$db" : "test"
     }
  
  The following example output contains the command object for a
  :doc:`getMore </reference/command/getMore>` operation generated by
  a command with cursor id ``80336119321`` on a collection named
  ``items`` in a database named ``test``:
  
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     "command" : {
       "getMore" : NumberLong("80336119321"),
       "collection" : "items",
       "$db" : "test"
     }
