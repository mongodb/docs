This guide shows you how to create an application that uses the
**Node.js driver** to connect to a **MongoDB Atlas cluster**. If you
prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different driver or programming
language, see our :driver:`list of official drivers <>`.

The Node.js driver is an interface through which you can connect to and
communicate with MongoDB instances.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that hosts your data
on MongoDB instances. We show you how to get started with your own free (no
credit card required) instance in this guide.

Follow the steps below to connect your Node.js application with a MongoDB
instance.

Set up Your Project
-------------------

Install Node and npm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure your system has Node.js version 12 or later and a compatible
version of npm (Node Package Manager) installed. For information on how
to check your version of Node and npm, as well as installation
instructions, see `downloading and installing Node.js and npm 
<https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm>`_.

Select the :guilabel:`Clone the Project` tab if you want to build your
project from a premade dependency file or the :guilabel:`Create the Project`
tab if you want to create the project dependency file yourself.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Clone the Project
      :tabid: clone the project

      First, ensure you have Git installed in your development
      environment or otherwise install it using `Git's Getting Started Guide
      <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`__.

      Then, from your shell, clone the `js-starter repository
      <https://github.com/mongodb-university/js-starter>`__:

      .. code-block:: bash

         git clone --branch v{+version+} https://github.com/mongodb-university/js-starter.git

      Next, navigate into the repository:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd js-starter

      Then, install the Node.js driver:

      .. code-block:: bash

         npm install

      This command performs the following actions:

      - Downloads and saves the ``mongodb`` package in a directory
        called ``node_modules``
      - Installs ``eslint``, which the project uses to identify and
        report issues in your code
      - Installs ``prettier``, which the project uses to format your code

   .. tab:: Create the Project
      :tabid: create the project

      First, in your shell, create a directory for your project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir node_quickstart

      Then, navigate into that directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd node_quickstart

      Next, initialize your project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         npm init -y

      .. tip:: Why the -y?

         If you specify the ``-y`` option in the command, npm uses the
         default values for your project settings. If you want to
         interactively select your project settings, omit the ``-y`` flag.

      Then, install the Node.js driver:

      .. code-block:: bash

         npm install mongodb@{+version+}

      This command performs the following actions:

      - Downloads the ``mongodb`` package and the dependencies it requires
      - Saves the package in the ``node_modules`` directory
      - Records the dependency information in the ``package.json`` file

At this point, you are ready to use the MongoDB Node.js driver with your
application.

Create a MongoDB Cluster
------------------------

Set up a Free Tier Cluster in Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After installing the MongoDB Node.js driver, create a MongoDB instance to store
and manage your data. Complete the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started?tck=docs_driver_nodejs>` guide
to set up a new Atlas account and a free tier cluster (MongoDB instance).
Then, complete the :atlas:`Load Sample Data into Your Atlas Cluster </sample-data/?tck=docs_driver_nodejs>`
guide to insert sample data into your cluster.

After completing the steps in these Atlas guides, you should have a new MongoDB
cluster deployed in Atlas, a new database user, and sample datasets loaded
into your cluster.

Connect to your Cluster
-----------------------

In this step, we create and run an application that uses the MongoDB Node.js
driver to connect to your instance of MongoDB and run a query on the sample
data.

We pass instructions to the driver on where and how to connect to your
MongoDB instance in a string called the *connection string*. This string
includes information on the hostname or IP address and port of your
instance, authentication mechanism, user credentials when applicable, and
other connection options.

If you are connecting to an instance or cluster that is not hosted by Atlas,
see :ref:`Other Ways to Connect to MongoDB <node-other-ways-to-connect>` for
instructions on how to format your connection string.

To retrieve your connection string for the instance and user you created in
the previous step, log into your Atlas account and navigate to the
**Clusters** section and click the **Connect** button for the cluster that you
want to connect to as shown below.

.. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas_connection_select_cluster.png
   :alt: The connect button in the clusters section of the Atlas UI

Proceed to the **Connect Your Application** step and select the Node.js
driver. Select the :guilabel:`Connection String Only` tab and click the
:guilabel:`Copy` button to copy the *connection string* to your clipboard
as shown below.

.. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas_connection_copy_string.png
   :alt: The connection string copy button in the Connection String Only tab of the Atlas UI

Save your connection string to a safe location that you can access in the
next step.

Next, create a file to contain your application called ``index.js`` in your
``node_quickstart`` directory. Add the following code, replacing the ``uri``
variable with your connection string. Make sure to replace the "<password>"
section of the connection string with the password you created for your user
that has **atlasAdmin** permissions.

.. tip::

   The line of code assigning the ``MongoClient`` variable uses
   :mdn:`Object destructuring <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#object_destructuring>`,
   introduced to Node in v6. If you are using an older version of Node,
   use the following to declare ``MongoClient``.

   .. code-block:: js

      const MongoClient = require("mongodb").MongoClient;

.. code-block:: js

  const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");

  // Replace the uri string with your MongoDB deployment's connection string.
  const uri =
    "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>?retryWrites=true&writeConcern=majority";

  const client = new MongoClient(uri);

  async function run() {
    try {
      await client.connect();

      const database = client.db('sample_mflix');
      const movies = database.collection('movies');

      // Query for a movie that has the title 'Back to the Future'
      const query = { title: 'Back to the Future' };
      const movie = await movies.findOne(query);

      console.log(movie);
    } finally {
      // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error
      await client.close();
    }
  }
  run().catch(console.dir);

Run the sample code with the following command from your command line:

.. code-block:: none

   node index.js

When you run the command, the sample code should output the details of the
movie which resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none

   {
     _id: ...,
     plot: 'A young man is accidentally sent 30 years into the past...',
     genres: [ 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi' ],
     ...
     title: 'Back to the Future',
     ...
   }

If you receive an error, check whether you included the proper connection
string in the application code, and loaded the sample dataset in your Atlas
cluster.

After completing this step, you should have a working application that uses
the Node.js driver to connect to your MongoDB instance, run a query on the
sample data, and prints out the result.
