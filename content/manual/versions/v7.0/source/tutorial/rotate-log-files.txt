Overview
--------

When used with the ``--logpath`` option or :setting:`systemLog.path`
setting, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances
report a live account of all activity and operations to a log file. 
When reporting activity data to a log file, by default, MongoDB only
rotates logs in response to the :dbcommand:`logRotate` command, or when
the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` process receives a
``SIGUSR1`` signal from the operating system. Both server logs and
:ref:`audit logs <auditing>` may be rotated with the
:dbcommand:`logRotate` command, either together or independently.

MongoDB's standard log rotation approach archives the current
log file and starts a new one. To do this, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance renames the current log file by appending
a UTC timestamp to the filename, in :term:`ISODate` format. It then
opens a new log file, closes the old log file, and sends all new log
entries to the new log file.

You can also configure MongoDB to support the Linux/Unix ``logrotate``
utility by setting :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or
``--logRotate`` to ``reopen``. With ``reopen``, :binary:`~bin.mongod`
or :binary:`~bin.mongos` closes the log file, and
then reopens a log file with the same name, expecting that another
process renamed the file prior to rotation.

Finally, you can configure :binary:`~bin.mongod` to send log data to the
``syslog`` using the :option:`--syslog <mongod --syslog>` option. In
this case, you can take advantage of alternate log rotation tools.

.. note::

   :dbcommand:`logRotate` isn't a replicated command. You must connect 
   to each instance of a replica set and run :dbcommand:`logRotate` 
   to rotate the logs for replica set members.


To rotate the log files, you must perform one of these steps:

- Send a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` process.

- Run the MongoDB :dbcommand:`logRotate` command.

- Run the Linux/Unix ``logrotate`` utility.

See the examples later on this page.

Default Log Rotation Behavior
-----------------------------

By default, MongoDB uses the
``--logRotate rename`` behavior. 
With ``rename``, :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
:binary:`~bin.mongos` renames the current log file by appending a UTC 
timestamp to the filename, opens a new log file, closes the old log
file, and sends all new log entries to the new log file.

Log Rotation with ``--logRotate reopen``
----------------------------------------

Log rotation with ``--logRotate reopen`` closes and opens
the log file following the typical Linux/Unix log rotate behavior.

Syslog Log Rotation
-------------------

With syslog log rotation, :binary:`~bin.mongod` sends log data to the
syslog rather than writing it to a file.

Forcing a Log Rotation with ``SIGUSR1``
---------------------------------------

For Linux and Unix-based systems, you can use the ``SIGUSR1`` signal
to rotate the logs for a single process.

For example, if a running :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance has a
process ID (PID) of ``2200``, the following command rotates the log
file for that instance on Linux:

.. code-block:: bash

   kill -SIGUSR1 2200
