What is happening?
------------------

The Automation Agent is ending support for MongoDB 3.2 in Cloud
Manager. MongoDB 3.2 reached its
:website:`End of Life in September of 2018 </support-policy>`.
Addition support was provided via Automation for a year in order to
provide time to upgrade to a supported version of MongoDB.

When is this happening?
-----------------------

On November 12, 2019 MongoDB Servers running 3.2 in Cloud Manager will
be unmanaged, meaning removed from Automation.

What does “unmanaged” mean?
---------------------------

It means Automation will no longer manage your MongoDB 3.2 deployments.
To use Automation again in Cloud Manager -- to return to management --
after November 12, one must either manually upgrade the cluster(s) and
and then reimport the cluster(s) to be managed or move to MongoDB’s
Database as a Service Offering, MongoDB Atlas.

.. note::

   Unmanaged simply means removed from Automation, your MongoDB
   installation will not be impacted in any other way.

.. _options-prep:

What are my options to prepare for November 12?
-----------------------------------------------

You have two possible paths forward, the choice is yours:

- :doc:`Upgrade your 3.2 cluster </tutorial/edit-deployment>` to a
  supported MongoDB Version (3.4 and up) before November 12 via Cloud
  Manager.

- Transition to MongoDB’s Database as a Service, MongoDB Atlas, using
  the incredibly easy to use Live Migrate:

  - If the 3.2 cluster is a replica set you can use
    :atlas:`Live Migrate </import/live-import>` as is to move to Atlas.

  - If the 3.2 cluster is a sharded cluster you must

    1. :doc:`upgrade it to MongoDB 3.4 </tutorial/edit-deployment>`,
       then
    2. :atlas:`use Live Migrate </import/live-import-sharded>`.

What about Backup and Monitoring?
---------------------------------

While backup and monitoring are not directly impacted by this EoL any
Monitoring or Backup features that you utilize that depend on
Automation provided services will no longer function after November 12
for 3.2 deployments. This includes, but is not limited to:

- MongoDB log management,
- Data Explorer,
- Performance Advisor, and
- Automated Restores.

My config servers use |sccc|, not |csrs|. Do I need to change that?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ending the life of MongoDB 3.2, MongoDB also removes the ability to
use Automation to convert from |sccc| to |csrs|.

Impacted users were notified in May 2019 to provide additional time
since this is a required step before upgrading further. If you wish to
use Automation to convert your config servers follow
:doc:`this tutorial </tutorial/convert-config-servers-to-replica-set>`.

After conversion, follow one of the options under the question
:ref:`What are my options to prepare for November 12? <options-prep>`.

If you do not convert the config servers with Automation before
November 12, you must convert the config servers manually and upgrade
to a supported MongoDB version before you can re-import your
configuration for |mms| to manage.
