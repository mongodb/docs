:ref:`Natural Language Charts <nlc>` is powered by Generative AI
(Gen AI) and might give inaccurate responses. For more information about 
Gen AI in MongoDB products, see `Generative AI FAQ 
<https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/faq-ai-features>`__.

Third Party Providers
---------------------

Natural Language Charts currently uses the `Azure OpenAI Service
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__ 
hosted by Microsoft. This is subject to change in the future. 

How Your Data is Used
---------------------

When you use Natural Language Charts, |charts| sends the following information
to MongoDB's backend and/or the third-party AI provider:

- The full text of your natural language prompt.
- The schema of the collection used to generate the chart,
  including collection names, field names, and field data types.
- Sample field values to improve the quality of chart recommendations.

The information sent will not be shared with any other third parties 
or stored by the AI provider. We do not share database connection 
strings or credentials from your databases. By default, your original 
query text will be stored by MongoDB for up to one year to help us 
provide support to customers and improve the service. 

Disable Natural Language Charts
-------------------------------

- |charts-short| enables Natural Language Charts once you click the 
  :guilabel:`Use Natural Language Mode` button. For details on enabling
  this feature, see :ref:`<charts-experimental-features>`.
- If you no longer want to use Natural Language Charts, you can ignore this button and 
  |charts-short| will not send data to the Generative AI models. If you are a
  :authrole:`Project Owner`, you can disable access to Natural Language Charts
  by navigating to the :guilabel:`AI features` page in the 
  left navigation menu and setting the toggle to off.
