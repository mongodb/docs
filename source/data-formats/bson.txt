In this tutorial, you can learn how to use the Ruby BSON library.

Installation
------------

The BSON library can be installed from `Rubygems <http://rubygems.org>`_
manually or with bundler.

To install the gem manually:

.. code-block:: sh

    gem install bson

To install the gem with bundler, include the following in your ``Gemfile``:

.. code-block:: ruby

    gem 'bson'

The BSON library is compatible with MRI >= 2.5 and JRuby >= 9.2.

Use With ActiveSupport
----------------------

Serialization for ActiveSupport-defined classes, such as TimeWithZone, is
not loaded by default to avoid a hard dependency of BSON on ActiveSupport.
When using BSON in an application that also uses ActiveSupport, the
ActiveSupport-related code must be explicitly required:

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'bson'
    require 'bson/active_support'

BSON Serialization
------------------

Getting a Ruby object's raw BSON representation is done by calling ``to_bson``
on the Ruby object, which will return a ``BSON::ByteBuffer``. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

  "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day".to_bson
  1024.to_bson

Generating an object from BSON is done via calling ``from_bson`` on the class
you wish to instantiate and passing it a ``BSON::ByteBuffer`` instance.

.. code-block:: ruby

  String.from_bson(byte_buffer)
  BSON::Int32.from_bson(byte_buffer)


Byte Buffers
------------

BSON library 4.0 introduces the use of native byte buffers in MRI and JRuby
instead of using ``StringIO``, for improved performance.

Writing
~~~~~~~

To create a ``ByteBuffer`` for writing (i.e. serializing to BSON),
instantiate ``BSON::ByteBuffer`` with no arguments:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new

To write raw bytes to the byte buffer with no transformations, use
``put_byte`` and ``put_bytes`` methods. They take a byte string as the argument
and copy this string into the buffer. ``put_byte`` enforces that the argument
is a string of length 1; ``put_bytes`` accepts any length strings.
The strings can contain null bytes.

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.put_byte("\x00")

  buffer.put_bytes("\xff\xfe\x00\xfd")

.. note::

  ``put_byte`` and ``put_bytes`` do not write a BSON type byte prior to
  writing the argument to the byte buffer.

Subsequent write methods write objects of particular types in the
`BSON spec <http://bsonspec.org/spec.html>`_. Note that the type indicated
by the method name takes precedence over the type of the argument -
for example, if a floating-point value is given to ``put_int32``, it is
coerced into an integer and the resulting integer is written to the byte
buffer.

To write a UTF-8 string (BSON type 0x02) to the byte buffer, use ``put_string``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.put_string("hello, world")

Note that BSON strings are always encoded in UTF-8. Therefore, the
argument must be either in UTF-8 or in an encoding convertable to UTF-8
(i.e. not binary). If the argument is in an encoding other than UTF-8,
the string is first converted to UTF-8 and the UTF-8 encoded version is
written to the buffer. The string must be valid in its claimed encoding,
including being valid UTF-8 if the encoding is UTF-8.
The string may contain null bytes.

The BSON specification also defines a CString type, which is used for
example for document keys. To write CStrings to the buffer, use ``put_cstring``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.put_cstring("hello, world")

As with regular strings, CStrings in BSON must be UTF-8 encoded. If the
argument is not in UTF-8, it is converted to UTF-8 and the resulting string
is written to the buffer. Unlike ``put_string``, the UTF-8 encoding of
the argument given to ``put_cstring`` cannot have any null bytes, since the
CString serialization format in BSON is null terminated.

Unlike ``put_string``, ``put_cstring`` also accepts symbols and integers.
In all cases the argument is stringified prior to being written:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.put_cstring(:hello)
  buffer.put_cstring(42)

To write a 32-bit or a 64-bit integer to the byte buffer, use
``put_int32`` and ``put_int64`` methods respectively. Note that Ruby
integers can be arbitrarily large; if the value being written exceeds the
range of a 32-bit or a 64-bit integer, ``put_int32`` and ``put_int64``
raise ``RangeError``.

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.put_int32(12345)
  buffer.put_int64(123456789012345)

.. note::

  If ``put_int32`` or ``put_int64`` are given floating point arguments,
  the arguments are first coerced into integers and the integers are
  written to the byte buffer.

To write a 64-bit floating point value to the byte buffer, use ``put_double``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.put_double(3.14159)

To obtain the serialized data as a byte string (for example, to send the data
over a socket), call ``to_s`` on the buffer:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new
  buffer.put_string('testing')
  socket.write(buffer.to_s)

.. note::

  ``ByteBuffer`` keeps track of read and write positions separately.
  There is no way to rewind the buffer for writing - ``rewind`` only affects
  the read position.

Reading
~~~~~~~

To create a ``ByteBuffer`` for reading (i.e. deserializing from BSON),
instantiate ``BSON::ByteBuffer`` with a byte string as the argument:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new(string) # a read mode buffer.

Reading from the buffer is done via the following API:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.get_byte # Pulls a single byte from the buffer.
  buffer.get_bytes(value) # Pulls n number of bytes from the buffer.
  buffer.get_cstring # Pulls a null-terminated string from the buffer.
  buffer.get_double # Pulls a 64-bit floating point from the buffer.
  buffer.get_int32 # Pulls a 32-bit integer (4 bytes) from the buffer.
  buffer.get_int64 # Pulls a 64-bit integer (8 bytes) from the buffer.
  buffer.get_string # Pulls a UTF-8 string from the buffer.

To restart reading from the beginning of a buffer, use ``rewind``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  buffer.rewind

.. note::

  ``ByteBuffer`` keeps track of read and write positions separately.
  ``rewind`` only affects the read position.

Supported Classes
-----------------

Core Ruby classes that have representations in the BSON specification and
will have a ``to_bson`` method defined for them are: ``Object``, ``Array``,
``FalseClass``, ``Float``, ``Hash``, ``Integer``, ``BigDecimal``, ``NilClass``,
``Regexp``, ``String``, ``Symbol`` (deprecated), ``Time``, ``TrueClass``.

In addition to the core Ruby objects, BSON also provides some special types
specific to the specification:

``BSON::Binary``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``BSON::Binary`` objects to store arbitrary binary data. You can construct
``Binary`` objects from binary strings, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Binary.new("binary_string")
  # => <BSON::Binary:0x47113101192900 type=generic data=0x62696e6172795f73...>

By default, ``Binary`` objects are created with BSON binary subtype 0
(``:generic``). You can explicitly specify the subtype to indicate that
the bytes encode a particular type of data:

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Binary.new("binary_string", :user)
  # => <BSON::Binary:0x47113101225420 type=user data=0x62696e6172795f73...>

Valid subtypes are ``:generic``, ``:function``, ``:old``, ``:uuid_old``,
``:uuid``, ``:md5`` and ``:user``.

You can use the ``data`` and ``type`` attributes to retrieve a
``Binary`` object's data and the subtype, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: ruby

  binary = BSON::Binary.new("binary_string", :user)
  binary.data
  => "binary_string"
  binary.type
  => :user

You can compare ``Binary`` objects by using the ``<=>`` operator, which allows
you to sort objects that have the same binary subtype. To compare ``Binary`` objects,
ensure that you install v5.0.2 or later of the BSON library.

.. note::

  ``BSON::Binary`` objects always store the data in ``BINARY`` encoding,
  regardless of the encoding that the string passed to the constructor
  was in:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    str = "binary_string"
    str.encoding
    # => #<Encoding:US-ASCII>
    binary = BSON::Binary.new(str)
    binary.data
    # => "binary_string"
    binary.data.encoding
    # => #<Encoding:ASCII-8BIT>

UUID Methods
````````````

To create a UUID BSON::Binary (binary subtype 4) from its RFC 4122-compliant
string representation, use the ``from_uuid`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

  uuid_str = "00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff"
  BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str)
  # => <BSON::Binary:0x46986653612880 type=uuid data=0x0011223344556677...>

To stringify a UUID BSON::Binary to an RFC 4122-compliant representation,
use the ``to_uuid`` method:

.. code-block:: ruby

  binary = BSON::Binary.new("\x00\x11\x22\x33\x44\x55\x66\x77\x88\x99\xAA\xBB\xCC\xDD\xEE\xFF".force_encoding('BINARY'), :uuid)
  => <BSON::Binary:0x46942046606480 type=uuid data=0x0011223344556677...>
  binary.to_uuid
  => "00112233-4455-6677-8899aabbccddeeff"

The standard representation may be explicitly specified when invoking both
``from_uuid`` and ``to_uuid`` methods:

.. code-block:: ruby

  binary = BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str, :standard)
  binary.to_uuid(:standard)

Note that the ``:standard`` representation can only be used with a Binary
of subtype ``:uuid`` (not ``:uuid_old``).

Legacy UUIDs
````````````

Data stored in BSON::Binary objects of subtype 3 (``:uuid_old``) may be
persisted in one of three different byte orders depending on which driver
created the data. The byte orders are CSharp legacy, Java legacy and Python
legacy. The Python legacy byte order is the same as the standard RFC 4122
byte order; CSharp legacy and Java legacy byte orders have some of the bytes
swapped.

The Binary object containing a legacy UUID does not encode *which* format
the UUID is stored in. Therefore, methods that convert to and from the legacy
UUID format take the desired format, or representation, as their argument.
An application may copy legacy UUID Binary objects without knowing which byte
order they store their data in.

The following methods for working with legacy UUIDs are provided for
interoperability with existing deployments storing data in legacy UUID formats.
It is recommended that new applications use the ``:uuid`` (subtype 4) format
only, which is compliant with RFC 4122.

To stringify a legacy UUID BSON::Binary, use the ``to_uuid`` method specifying
the desired representation. Accepted representations are ``:csharp_legacy``,
``:java_legacy`` and ``:python_legacy``. Note that a legacy UUID BSON::Binary
cannot be stringified without specifying a representation.

.. code-block:: ruby

  binary = BSON::Binary.new("\x00\x11\x22\x33\x44\x55\x66\x77\x88\x99\xAA\xBB\xCC\xDD\xEE\xFF".force_encoding('BINARY'), :uuid_old)
  => <BSON::Binary:0x46942046606480 type=uuid data=0x0011223344556677...>

  binary.to_uuid
  # => ArgumentError (Representation must be specified for BSON::Binary objects of type :uuid_old)

  binary.to_uuid(:csharp_legacy)
  # => "33221100-5544-7766-8899aabbccddeeff"

  binary.to_uuid(:java_legacy)
  # => "77665544-3322-1100-ffeeddccbbaa9988"

  binary.to_uuid(:python_legacy)
  # => "00112233-4455-6677-8899aabbccddeeff"

To create a legacy UUID BSON::Binary from the string representation of the
UUID, use the ``from_uuid`` method specifying the desired representation:

.. code-block:: ruby

  uuid_str = "00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff"

  BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str, :csharp_legacy)
  # => <BSON::Binary:0x46986653650480 type=uuid_old data=0x3322110055447766...>

  BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str, :java_legacy)
  # => <BSON::Binary:0x46986653663960 type=uuid_old data=0x7766554433221100...>

  BSON::Binary.from_uuid(uuid_str, :python_legacy)
  # => <BSON::Binary:0x46986653686300 type=uuid_old data=0x0011223344556677...>

These methods can be used to convert from one representation to another:

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Binary.from_uuid('77665544-3322-1100-ffeeddccbbaa9988',:java_legacy).to_uuid(:csharp_legacy)
  # => "33221100-5544-7766-8899aabbccddeeff"

``BSON::Code``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represents a string of JavaScript code.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Code.new("this.value = 5;")

``BSON::CodeWithScope``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

  The ``CodeWithScope`` type is deprecated as of MongoDB 4.2.1. Starting
  with MongoDB 4.4, support from ``CodeWithScope`` is being removed from
  various server commands and operators such as ``$where``. Please use
  other BSON types and operators when working with MongoDB 4.4 and newer.

Represents a string of JavaScript code with a hash of values.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::CodeWithScope.new("this.value = age;", age: 5)

``BSON::DBRef``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a subclass of ``BSON::Document`` that provides accessors for the
collection, id, and database of the DBRef.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::DBRef.new({"$ref" => "collection", "$id" => "id"})
  BSON::DBRef.new({"$ref" => "collection", "$id" => "id", "database" => "db"})

.. note::

  The BSON::DBRef constructor will validate the given hash and will raise an ArgumentError
  if it is not a valid DBRef. ``BSON::ExtJSON.parse_obj`` and ``Hash.from_bson`` will not
  raise an error if given an invalid DBRef, and will parse a Hash or deserialize a
  BSON::Document instead.

.. note::

  All BSON documents are deserialized into instances of BSON::DBRef if they are
  valid DBRefs, otherwise they are deserialized into instances of BSON::Document.
  This is true even when the invocation is made from the ``Hash`` class:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    bson = {"$ref" => "collection", "$id" => "id"}.to_bson.to_s
    loaded = Hash.from_bson(BSON::ByteBuffer.new(bson))
    => {"$ref"=>"collection", "$id"=>"id"}
    loaded.class
    => BSON::DBRef

For backwards compatibility with the MongoDB Ruby driver versions 2.17 and
earlier, ``BSON::DBRef`` also can be constructed using the legacy driver API.
This API is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of ``bson-ruby``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::DBRef.new("collection", BSON::ObjectId('61eeb760a15d5d0f9f1e401d'))
  BSON::DBRef.new("collection", BSON::ObjectId('61eeb760a15d5d0f9f1e401d'), "db")

``BSON::Document``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a subclass of ``Hash`` that stores all keys as strings, but allows
access to them with symbol keys.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Document[:key, "value"]
  BSON::Document.new

.. note::

  All BSON documents are deserialized into instances of BSON::Document
  (or BSON::DBRef, if they happen to be a valid DBRef), even when the
  invocation is made from the ``Hash`` class:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    bson = {test: 1}.to_bson.to_s
    loaded = Hash.from_bson(BSON::ByteBuffer.new(bson))
    => {"test"=>1}
    loaded.class
    => BSON::Document

``BSON::MaxKey``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represents a value in BSON that will always compare higher to another value.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::MaxKey.new

``BSON::MinKey``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represents a value in BSON that will always compare lower to another value.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::MinKey.new

``BSON::ObjectId``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represents a 12 byte unique identifier for an object on a given machine.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::ObjectId.new

``BSON::Timestamp``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represents a special time with a start and increment value.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Timestamp.new(5, 30)

``BSON::Undefined``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represents a placeholder for a value that was not provided.

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Undefined.new

``BSON::Decimal128``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represents a 128-bit decimal-based floating-point value capable of emulating
decimal rounding with exact precision.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Instantiate with a String
  BSON::Decimal128.new("1.28")

  # Instantiate with a BigDecimal
  d = BigDecimal(1.28, 3)
  BSON::Decimal128.new(d)

BSON::Decimal128 vs BigDecimal
``````````````````````````````
The ``BigDecimal`` ``from_bson`` and ``to_bson`` methods use the same
``BSON::Decimal128`` methods under the hood. This leads to some limitations
that are imposed on the ``BigDecimal`` values that can be serialized to BSON
and those that can be deserialized from existing ``decimal128`` BSON
values. This change was made because serializing ``BigDecimal`` instances as
``BSON::Decimal128`` instances allows for more flexibility in terms of querying
and aggregation in MongoDB. The limitations imposed on ``BigDecimal`` are as
follows:

- ``decimal128`` has a limited range and precision, while ``BigDecimal`` has no
  restrictions in terms of range and precision. ``decimal128`` has a max value
  of approximately ``10^6145`` and a min value of approximately ``-10^6145``,
  and has a maximum of 34 bits of precision.

- ``decimal128`` is able to accept signed ``NaN`` values, while ``BigDecimal``
  is not. All signed ``NaN`` values that are deserialized into ``BigDecimal``
  instances will be unsigned.

- ``decimal128`` maintains trailing zeroes when serializing to and
  deserializing from BSON. ``BigDecimal``, however, does not maintain trailing
  zeroes and therefore using ``BigDecimal`` may result in a lack of precision.

.. note::

  In BSON 5.0, ``decimal128`` is deserialized into ``BigDecimal`` by
  default. In order to have ``decimal128`` values in BSON documents
  deserialized into ``BSON::Decimal128``, the ``mode: :bson`` option can be set
  on ``from_bson``.

``Symbol``
~~~~~~~~~~

The BSON specification defines a symbol type which allows round-tripping
Ruby ``Symbol`` values (i.e., a Ruby ``Symbol``is encoded into a BSON symbol
and a BSON symbol is decoded into a Ruby ``Symbol``). However, since most
programming langauges do not have a native symbol type, to promote
interoperabilty, MongoDB deprecated the BSON symbol type and encourages
strings to be used instead.

.. note::

  In BSON, hash *keys* are always strings. Non-string values will be
  stringified when used as hash keys:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    Hash.from_bson({foo: 'bar'}.to_bson)
    # => {"foo"=>"bar"}

    Hash.from_bson({1 => 2}.to_bson)
    # => {"1"=>2}

By default, the BSON library encodes ``Symbol`` hash values as strings and
decodes BSON symbols into Ruby ``Symbol`` values:

.. code-block:: ruby

  {foo: :bar}.to_bson.to_s
  # => "\x12\x00\x00\x00\x02foo\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00bar\x00\x00"

  # 0x02 is the string type
  Hash.from_bson(BSON::ByteBuffer.new("\x12\x00\x00\x00\x02foo\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00bar\x00\x00".force_encoding('BINARY')))
  # => {"foo"=>"bar"}

  # 0x0E is the symbol type
  Hash.from_bson(BSON::ByteBuffer.new("\x12\x00\x00\x00\x0Efoo\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00bar\x00\x00".force_encoding('BINARY')))
  # => {"foo"=>:bar}

To force encoding of Ruby symbols to BSON symbols, wrap the Ruby symbols in
``BSON::Symbol::Raw``:

.. code-block:: ruby

  {foo: BSON::Symbol::Raw.new(:bar)}.to_bson.to_s
  # => "\x12\x00\x00\x00\x0Efoo\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00bar\x00\x00"

JSON Serialization
------------------

Some BSON types have special representations in JSON. These are as follows
and will be automatically serialized in the form when calling ``to_json`` on
them.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 105

   * - Object
     - JSON

   * - ``BSON::Binary``
     - ``{ "$binary" : "\x01", "$type" : "md5" }``

   * - ``BSON::Code``
     - ``{ "$code" : "this.v = 5" }``

   * - ``BSON::CodeWithScope``
     - ``{ "$code" : "this.v = value", "$scope" : { v => 5 }}``

   * - ``BSON::DBRef``
     - ``{ "$ref" : "collection", "$id" : { "$oid" : "id" }, "$db" : "database" }``

   * - ``BSON::MaxKey``
     - ``{ "$maxKey" : 1 }``

   * - ``BSON::MinKey``
     - ``{ "$minKey" : 1 }``

   * - ``BSON::ObjectId``
     - ``{ "$oid" : "4e4d66343b39b68407000001" }``

   * - ``BSON::Timestamp``
     - ``{ "t" : 5, "i" : 30 }``

   * - ``Regexp``
     - ``{ "$regex" : "[abc]", "$options" : "i" }``


Time Instances
--------------

Times in Ruby can have nanosecond precision. Times in BSON (and MongoDB)
can only have millisecond precision. When Ruby ``Time`` instances are
serialized to BSON or Extended JSON, the times are floored to the nearest
millisecond.

.. note::

  The time as always rounded down. If the time precedes the Unix epoch
  (January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC), the absolute value of the time would
  increase:

  .. code-block:: ruby

    time = Time.utc(1960, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 999_999)
    time.to_f
    # => -315619199.000001
    time.floor(3).to_f
    # => -315619199.001

.. note::

  JRuby as of version 9.2.11.0 `rounds pre-Unix epoch times up rather than
  down <https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/6104>`_. bson-ruby works around
  this and correctly floors the times when serializing on JRuby.

Because of this flooring, applications are strongly recommended to perform
all time calculations using integer math, as inexactness of floating point
calculations may produce unexpected results.

DateTime Instances
------------------

BSON only supports storing the time as the number of seconds since the
Unix epoch. Ruby's ``DateTime`` instances can be serialized to BSON,
but when the BSON is deserialized the times will be returned as
``Time`` instances.

``DateTime`` class in Ruby supports non-Gregorian calendars. When non-Gregorian
``DateTime`` instances are serialized, they are first converted to Gregorian
calendar, and the respective date in the Gregorian calendar is stored in the
database.


Date Instances
--------------

BSON only supports storing the time as the number of seconds since the
Unix epoch. Ruby's ``Date`` instances can be serialized to BSON, but when
the BSON is deserialized the times will be returned as ``Time`` instances.

When ``Date`` instances are serialized, the time value used is midnight
of the day that the ``Date`` refers to in UTC.


Regular Expressions
-------------------

Both MongoDB and Ruby provide facilities for working with regular expressions,
but they use regular expression engines. The following subsections detail the
differences between Ruby regular expressions and MongoDB regular expressions
and describe how to work with both.

Ruby vs MongoDB Regular Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB server uses `Perl-compatible regular expressions implemented using
the PCRE library <http://pcre.org/>`_ and `Ruby regular expressions
<http://ruby-doc.org/core/Regexp.html>`_ are implemented using the
`Onigmo regular expression engine <https://github.com/k-takata/Onigmo>`_,
which is a fork of `Oniguruma <https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma>`_.
The two regular expression implementations generally provide equivalent
functionality but have several important syntax differences, as described
below.

Unfortunately, there is no simple way to programmatically convert a PCRE
regular expression into the equivalent Ruby regular expression,
and there are currently no Ruby bindings for PCRE.

Options / Flags / Modifiers
```````````````````````````

Both Ruby and PCRE regular expressions support modifiers. These are
also called "options" in Ruby parlance and "flags" in PCRE parlance.
The meaning of ``s`` and ``m`` modifiers differs in Ruby and PCRE:

- Ruby does not have the ``s`` modifier, instead the Ruby ``m`` modifier
  performs the same function as the PCRE ``s`` modifier which is to make the
  period (``.``) match any character including newlines. Confusingly, the
  Ruby documentation refers to the ``m`` modifier as "enabling multi-line mode".
- Ruby always operates in the equivalent of PCRE's multi-line mode, enabled by
  the ``m`` modifier in PCRE regular expressions. In Ruby the ``^`` anchor
  always refers to the beginning of line and the ``$`` anchor always refers
  to the end of line.

When writing regular expressions intended to be used in both Ruby and
PCRE environments (including MongoDB server and most other MongoDB drivers),
henceforth referred to as "portable regular expressions", avoid using
the ``^`` and ``$`` anchors. The following sections provide workarounds and
recommendations for authoring portable regular expressions.

``^`` Anchor
````````````

In Ruby regular expressions, the ``^`` anchor always refers to the beginning
of line. In PCRE regular expressions, the ``^`` anchor refers to the beginning
of input by default and the ``m`` flag changes its meaning to the beginning
of line.

Both Ruby and PCRE regular expressions support the ``\A`` anchor to refer to
the beginning of input, regardless of modifiers.

When writing portable regular expressions:

- Use the ``\A`` anchor to refer to the beginning of input.
- Use the ``^`` anchor to refer to the beginning of line (this requires
  setting the ``m`` flag in PCRE regular expressions). Alternatively use
  one of the following constructs which work regardless of modifiers:
  - ``(?:\A|(?<=\n))`` (handles LF and CR+LF line ends)
  - ``(?:\A|(?<=[\r\n]))`` (handles CR, LF and CR+LF line ends)

``$`` Anchor
````````````

In Ruby regular expressions, the ``$`` anchor always refers to the end
of line. In PCRE regular expressions, the ``$`` anchor refers to the end
of input by default and the ``m`` flag changes its meaning to the end
of line.

Both Ruby and PCRE regular expressions support the ``\z`` anchor to refer to
the end of input, regardless of modifiers.

When writing portable regular expressions:

- Use the ``\z`` anchor to refer to the end of input.
- Use the ``$`` anchor to refer to the beginning of line (this requires
  setting the ``m`` flag in PCRE regular expressions). Alternatively use
  one of the following constructs which work regardless of modifiers:
  - ``(?:\z|(?=\n))`` (handles LF and CR+LF line ends)
  - ``(?:\z|(?=[\n\n]))`` (handles CR, LF and CR+LF line ends)

``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since there is no simple way to programmatically convert a PCRE
regular expression into the equivalent Ruby regular expression,
bson-ruby provides the ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` class for holding MongoDB/PCRE
regular expressions. Instances of this class are called "BSON regular
expressions" in this documentation.

Instances of this class can be created using the regular expression text
as a string and optional PCRE modifiers:

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Regexp::Raw.new("^b403158")
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055df63186d78 @pattern="^b403158", @options="">

  BSON::Regexp::Raw.new("^Hello.world$", "s")
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055df6317f028 @pattern="^Hello.world$", @options="s">

The ``BSON::Regexp`` module is included in the Ruby ``Regexp`` class, such that
the ``BSON::`` prefix may be omitted:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Regexp::Raw.new("^b403158")
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055df63186d78 @pattern="^b403158", @options="">

  Regexp::Raw.new("^Hello.world$", "s")
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055df6317f028 @pattern="^Hello.world$", @options="s">

Regular Expression Conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To convert a Ruby regular expression to a BSON regular expression,
instantiate a ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` object as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  regexp = /^Hello.world/
  bson_regexp = BSON::Regexp::Raw.new(regexp.source, regexp.options)
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055df62e42d60 @pattern="^Hello.world", @options=0>

Note that the ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` constructor accepts both the Ruby numeric
options and the PCRE modifier strings.

To convert a BSON regular expression to a Ruby regular expression, call the
``compile`` method on the BSON regular expression:

.. code-block:: ruby

  bson_regexp = BSON::Regexp::Raw.new("^hello.world", "s")
  bson_regexp.compile
  # => /^hello.world/m

  bson_regexp = BSON::Regexp::Raw.new("^hello", "")
  bson_regexp.compile
  # => /^hello.world/

  bson_regexp = BSON::Regexp::Raw.new("^hello.world", "m")
  bson_regexp.compile
  # => /^hello.world/

Note that the ``s`` PCRE modifier was converted to the ``m`` Ruby modifier
in the first example, and the last two examples were converted to the same
regular expression even though the original BSON regular expressions had
different meanings.

When a BSON regular expression uses the non-portable ``^`` and ``$``
anchors, its conversion to a Ruby regular expression can change its meaning:

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Regexp::Raw.new("^hello.world", "").compile =~ "42\nhello world"
  # => 3

When a Ruby regular expression is converted to a BSON regular expression
(for example, to send to the server as part of a query), the BSON regular
expression always has the ``m`` modifier set reflecting the behavior of
``^`` and ``$`` anchors in Ruby regular expressions.

Reading and Writing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both Ruby and BSON regular expressions implement the ``to_bson`` method
for serialization to BSON:

.. code-block:: ruby

  regexp_ruby = /^b403158/
  # => /^b403158/
  regexp_ruby.to_bson
  # => #<BSON::ByteBuffer:0x007fcf20ab8028>
  _.to_s
  # => "^b403158\x00m\x00"

  regexp_raw = Regexp::Raw.new("^b403158")
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x007fcf21808f98 @pattern="^b403158", @options="">
  regexp_raw.to_bson
  # => #<BSON::ByteBuffer:0x007fcf213622f0>
  _.to_s
  # => "^b403158\x00\x00"

Both ``Regexp`` and ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` classes implement the ``from_bson``
class method that deserializes a regular expression from a BSON byte buffer.
Methods of both classes return a ``BSON::Regexp::Raw`` instance that
must be converted to a Ruby regular expression using the ``compile`` method
as described above.

.. code-block:: ruby

  byte_buffer = BSON::ByteBuffer.new("^b403158\x00\x00")
  regex = Regexp.from_bson(byte_buffer)
  # => #<BSON::Regexp::Raw:0x000055df63100d40 @pattern="^b403158", @options="">
  regex.pattern
  # => "^b403158"
  regex.options
  # => ""
  regex.compile
  # => /^b403158/


Key Order
---------

BSON documents preserve the order of keys, because the documents are stored
as lists of key-value pairs. Hashes in Ruby also preserve key order; thus
the order of keys specified in Ruby will be respected when serializing a
hash to a BSON document, and when deserializing a BSON document into a hash
the order of keys in the document will match the order of keys in the hash.


Duplicate Keys
--------------

BSON specification allows BSON documents to have duplicate keys, because the
documents are stored as lists of key-value pairs. Applications should refrain
from generating such documents, because MongoDB server behavior is undefined
when a BSON document contains duplicate keys.

Since in Ruby hashes cannot have duplicate keys, when serializing Ruby hashes
to BSON documents no duplicate keys will be generated. (It is still possible
to hand-craft a BSON document that would have duplicate keys in Ruby, and
some of the other MongoDB BSON libraries may permit creating BSON documents
with duplicate keys.)

Note that, since keys in BSON documents are always stored as strings,
specifying the same key as as string and a symbol in Ruby only retains the
most recent specification:

.. code-block:: ruby

  BSON::Document.new(test: 1, 'test' => 2)
  => {"test"=>2}

When loading a BSON document with duplicate keys, the last value for a
duplicated key overwrites previous values for the same key.
