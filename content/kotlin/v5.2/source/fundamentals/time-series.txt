Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about **time series collections** in
MongoDB, and how to interact with them in the MongoDB Kotlin driver.

Time series collections efficiently store sequences of measurements over
a period of time. Time series data consists of any data collected over
time, metadata that describes the measurement, and the time of the
measurement.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33, 33, 33
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Example
     - Measurement
     - Metadata

   * - Sales Data
     - Revenue
     - Company

   * - Infection Rates
     - Amount of People Infected
     - Location

Create a Time Series Collection
-------------------------------

To create a time series collection, pass the following parameters to the
`createCollection() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-kotlin-coroutine/mongodb-driver-kotlin-coroutine/com.mongodb.kotlin.client.coroutine/-mongo-database/create-collection.html>`__
method:

- The name of the new collection to create
- The `TimeSeriesOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/TimeSeriesOptions.html>`__ 
  for creating the collection in a `CreateCollectionOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/CreateCollectionOptions.html>`__ object

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/TimeSeriesTest.snippet.create-time-series-collection.kt
   :language: kotlin

To check if you successfully created the collection, send the
``"listCollections"`` command to the `runCommand() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-kotlin-coroutine/mongodb-driver-kotlin-coroutine/com.mongodb.kotlin.client.coroutine/-mongo-database/run-command.html>`__ method.

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/TimeSeriesTest.snippet.check-time-series-collection-created.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output::
      :language:  json
      :emphasize-lines: 3, 5-9

      {
        "name": "september2021",
        "type": "timeseries",
        "options": {
          "timeseries": {
            "timeField": "temperature",
            "granularity": "seconds",
            "bucketMaxSpanSeconds": 3600
          }
        },
        "info": {
          "readOnly": false
        }
      }

Query a Time Series Collection
------------------------------

To query in a time series collection, use the same conventions as you
would for :doc:`retrieving </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/retrieve>`
and :ref:`aggregating data <kotlin-aggregation>`.

.. note:: Window Functions

   You can use window functions to perform operations on a
   contiguous span of time series data.

For more information, see our
:ref:`Aggregates Builders guide <builders-aggregates-setWindowFields>`.
