   Always refer to the official documentation of both MongoDB Atlas and 
   `Render <https://docs.render.com/migrate-mongodb-graphql-to-render>`__
   for the most up-to-date and accurate information. Specific steps may vary
   depending on the details of your project and the technologies used.

Render is a cloud application platform that helps developers flexibly deploy and
scale their apps and services. You can host your GraphQL API on Render alongside
the rest of your stack (frontend and backend). Your GraphQL servers can fetch
from all of the same data sources, including MongoDB Atlas.

On Render, you can auto-deploy code from a Git repo, configure private network
communication, autoscale services, and more.

See Render's `MongoDB GraphQL API Migration Guide <https://docs.render.com/migrate-mongodb-graphql-to-render>`__
for details on how to migrate to Render.
