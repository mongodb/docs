  Discover the dynamically assigned NodePort:

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl get services -n <metadata.namespace>

  The list output should contain an entry similar to the following:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     NAME                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE

     <my-sharded cluster>      NodePort    10.106.44.30    <none>        27017:30078/TCP   10s

  - |k8s| exposes |mongod| on port ``27017`` within the |k8s|
    container.

  - The NodePort service exposes the ``mongod`` via port ``30078``.
    NodePorts range from 30000 to 32767, inclusive.

title: Test the connection to the sharded cluster.
level: 4

ref: k8s-ext-sc-test-conn
content: |

  To connect to your deployment from outside of the |k8s| cluster, run
  the |mongod| command with the external |fqdn| of a |k8s-node| as the
  ``--host`` flag.

  .. example::

     If a node in the |k8s| cluster has an external |fqdn| of
     ``ec2-54-212-23-143.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com``, you can
     connect to this sharded cluster instance from outside of the |k8s|
     cluster using the following command:

     .. code-block:: sh
        :copyable: false

        mongo --host ec2-54-212-23-143.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com --port 30078
