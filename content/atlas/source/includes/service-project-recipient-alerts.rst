|service| Project is the default alert recipient. You can
configure the roles the alert is sent to and how it's 
delivered. You can't add a second |service| Project as the 
recipient.

|service| Project is available as an option in the 
:guilabel:`Add` list only if it is not currently in the 
recipients list.
