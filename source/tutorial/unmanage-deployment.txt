==============================================
Remove a Process from Management or Monitoring
==============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can remove a processes from management, monitoring, or both. Removing
a process from management (i.e., Automation) means you can no longer control
it directly
through |mms|. Removing it from monitoring means |mms| no longer displays
its status or tracks its metrics. You can remove individual processes or
an entire :term:`cluster <sharded cluster>` or :term:`replica set`.

Removing a process does not shut down the process. If you are removing a
**managed** process and want to be able to easily stop and start the
process after removal, you can :doc:`create scripts for stopping and
starting the process </tutorial/stop-using-automation>`.

If you do **not** want to leave a managed process running after removal,
:doc:`shut down the process </tutorial/shut-down-deployment>` before
removing it.

As an alternative to removing a process from **monitoring**, you can instead
disable its alerts, which allows you to continue to view the process in
the :guilabel:`Deployment` page but turns off notifications about its
status. To use this option, see :doc:`/tutorial/manage-host-alerts`.
