Aggregation operations with the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command have the
following limitations.

Result Size Restrictions
------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

   MongoDB 3.6 removes the option for the :dbcommand:`aggregate`
   command to return its results as a single document.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

Starting in MongoDB 2.6, the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command can return
either a cursor or store the results in a collection. When returning a
cursor or storing the results in a collection, each document in the
result set is subject to the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit,
currently 16 megabytes; if any single document that exceeds the
:limit:`BSON Document Size` limit, the command will produce an error.
The limit only applies to the returned documents; during the pipeline
processing, the documents may exceed this size. The
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method returns a cursor by default
starting in MongoDB 2.6.

Before MongoDB 2.6, the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command can only return
a single BSON document that contains the result set and will produce an
error if the total size of the result set exceeds the :limit:`BSON
Document Size` limit.
