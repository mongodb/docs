ref: param-default-format
content: |
  *Optional.* Default format that {+df+} assumes
  if it encounters a file without an extension while searching the
  ``databases.[n].collections.[n].dataSources.[n].storeName``.
   
  The following values are valid for the ``defaultFormat`` field:
      
  ``.json, .json.gz, .bson, .bson.gz, .avro, .avro.gz, .orc, .tsv, .tsv.gz, 
  .csv, .csv.gz, .parquet``

  .. note::
   
     If your file format is ``CSV`` or ``TSV``, you must include a header 
     row in your data. See :ref:`adf-csv-tsv-data` for more 
     information.

  If omitted, {+df+} attempts to detect the file type by 
  processing a few bytes of the file.

ref: param-max-wildcard-collections
content: | 
  *Optional.*  Maximum number of wildcard ``*`` collections in the database. 
  Each wildcard collection can have only one data source. Value can be between 
  ``1`` and ``1000``, inclusive. If omitted, defaults to ``100``.
---
ref: param-allow-insecure
content: | 

  *Optional.* Validates the scheme in the specified |url|\s. Value can be one 
  of the following: 

  - ``true`` to allow insecure |http| scheme 
  - ``false`` to only allow secure |https| scheme (default)

  If true, {+adf+}: 

  - Does not verify the server's certificate chain and hostname.
  - Accepts any certificate with any hostname presented by the server.

  .. warning:: 

     If you set this to ``true``, your data might become vulnerable to a 
     man-in-the-middle attack, which can compromise the confidentiality 
     and integrity of your data. Set this to ``true`` only for testing 
     and getting started with {+adf+}.

  If omitted, defaults to ``false``. If set to ``false``, {+df+} returns an 
  error similar to the following if a specified URL contains insecure |http| 
  scheme: 
    
  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false 

     The insecure HTTP scheme is not supported by default - please add a "allowInsecure: true" flag to query from such URLs.
