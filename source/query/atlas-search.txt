You can run Atlas Search :pipeline:`$search` and :pipeline:`$searchMeta`
queries from |compass| if you :ref:`created the Atlas Search index
<compass-create-search-index>` for data on the Atlas cluster. You can
also run :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries from |compass| if you have an
existing Atlas Vector search index on your data in Atlas. 

Steps
-----

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Find the index you want to use in your query
      
      a. From the :guilabel:`Indexes` tab, click :guilabel:`Search Indexes`.
      #. Hover over the index you want to use in your query.

   .. step:: Run the query
      
      a. Click the :guilabel:`Aggregate` button.

         |compass| switches to the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab where you 
         can run your query. 
        
      #. Construct your query.
         
         By default, |compass| selects the :pipeline:`$search` stage for
         your query. You can select the  :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage
         to use in your query. If you are using a ``vectorSearch`` type
         index in your query, you can only use the
         :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage in your query.  

         .. note:: 

            The Atlas Search :pipeline:`$search` and :pipeline:`$searchMeta` and 
            the Atlas Vector Search :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` pipeline stages must 
            be the first stage in your aggregation pipeline.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Run` to run your query.
