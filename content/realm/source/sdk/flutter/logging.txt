You can set or change your app's log level when developing or debugging 
your application. You might want to change the log level to log different 
amounts of data depending on your development needs. You can specify 
different log levels or custom loggers on a per-isolate basis.

   This page shows how to set a Realm logger. For information on how to set the
   Sync client log level in an earlier version, refer to
   :ref:`flutter-client-log-level`.

.. _flutter-set-the-client-log-level:

Set or Change the Realm Log Level
---------------------------------

In the Flutter SDK, you can set the level of detail in different parts of
your app. To configure the log level, pass a valid
:flutter-sdk:`LogLevel <realm/LogLevel.html>` value to
:flutter-sdk:`setLogLevel <realm/RealmLogger/setLogLevel.html>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/logger.snippet.set-the-log-level.dart
   :language: dart

You can change the log level to increase or decrease verbosity at different
points in your code. This behavior differs from the deprecated 
:ref:`sync client log level <flutter-client-log-level>`, which had to be set
before opening a synced realm and could not be changed.

   :language: dart

.. _flutter-customize-logger:

Customize the Logger
--------------------

The Flutter SDK logger conforms to the `Dart Logger class 
<https://pub.dev/documentation/logging/latest/logging/Logger-class.html>`__.

To get started, set a log level:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/logger.snippet.set-custom-logger.dart
   :language: dart

Define custom logging behavior by listening to :flutter-sdk:`Realm.logger.onRecord 
<realm/RealmLogger/onRecord.html>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/logger.snippet.attach-to-logger.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-turn-off-logging:

Turn Off Logging
----------------

You can turn off logging by passing ``LogLevel.off`` to ``setLogLevel()``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/logger.snippet.set-log-level-to-off.dart
   :language: dart
