.. note:: **Availability**

   |service| provides |fts| metrics for clusters with at least one 
   active |fts| index. To set up an |fts| index, see
   :ref:`fts-top-ref`.

To view |service| search metrics, click the :guilabel:`Metrics` button 
for that cluster. Alternatively, click on the name of the cluster
to open the cluster overview, then click the :guilabel:`Metrics` tab. Select one or more of the search charts.

The following |fts| metrics are available to evaluate and optimize your 
|fts| indexes:

   * - :guilabel:`Search Process Memory` 
   
     - Displays the total bytes of memory that search processes occupy.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Process CPU`
   
     - Displays the percentage of time that the CPU spent servicing 
       search processes. For servers with more than 1 CPU core, this value can exceed 100%.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Normalized Process CPU`
   
     - Displays CPU usage of search processes on the node scaled to a 
       range of 0-100% by dividing by the number of CPU cores.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Disk Space Used`
   
     - Displays the total bytes of disk space that search processes use.
