  Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to one of the members and run
  :method:`rs.status()` to determine the primary and secondary members.

title: Restart secondary members with the ``--shardsvr`` option.
level: 4
ref: restart-secondary
pre: |
  One secondary at a time, :ref:`shut down <terminate-mongod-processes>` 
  and restart each :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>` 
  with the :option:`--shardsvr <mongod --shardsvr>` option. 
  
  .. warning::

     This step requires some downtime for applications connected to 
     secondary members of the replica set. Applications connected to a 
     secondary may error with ``CannotVerifyAndSignLogicalTime`` after 
     restarting the secondary until you perform the steps in 
     :ref:`convert-add-initial-shard`. Restarting your application will
     also stop it from receiving ``CannotVerifyAndSignLogicalTime`` 
     errors.

  To continue to use the same port, include the :option:`--port <mongod --port>`
  option. Include additional options, such as :option:`--bind_ip <mongod --bind_ip>`, as
  appropriate for your deployment.
