Use punctuation correctly and consistently. This section provides
guidelines for using punctuation in MongoDB documentation. For basic
rules about punctuation, see `section 5, Grammar and Usage

Ampersands
~~~~~~~~~~

Don't use an ampersand (&) in text or headings to mean *and* unless
you're referring to the symbol on the UI. In the following example, the
button name on the UI includes an ampersand (&):

To continue, click **Save & Go to Step 3**.

.. _colons:

Colons
~~~~~~

Use the following guidelines for colons:

- Use a colon at the end of a sentence that introduces a list, table,
  figure, or example. If another sentence intervenes between the
  introduction and the thing being introduced, use a period instead of
  a colon.

- Use a colon at the end of the step to introduce substeps, a bullet
  list, or code that the user is expected to enter.

- In a list item, if you need to separate an initial term or phrase
  from the information that follows it, use a colon. For example:

  **Public**: This setting allows any two servers with public IP
  addresses to be load balanced. These can be nodes outside of the
  MongoDB network, but if they are, standard bandwidth rates apply.

- Don't use a colon at the end a table column header, a title, or a
  heading.

- Avoid using colons in sentences. You can almost always use two
  sentences instead. If you do use a colon in a sentence, however,
  don't capitalize the word that follows the colon unless the word is
  proper or is the beginning of a quotation.

- If a title or heading includes a colon, capitalize the first word
  that follows the colon, regardless of its part of speech.

- When you use a colon in a sentence, use lowercase for the first word
  that follows the colon unless it is a proper noun. When the colon
  introduces two or more sentences, a quotation, or question, capitalize
  the first word after the colon (from the Chicago Manual of Style 6.63, v17).

Commas
~~~~~~

Use the following guidelines for commas. For basic comma usage, see
`section 6.16, Commas
<https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/part2/ch06/psec016.html>`__
in the *Chicago Manual of Style*.

       If you join independent clauses, insert a coordinating
       conjunction (such as *and*) between them and precede the
       conjunction with a comma.

.. _dashes:

Dashes
~~~~~~

An *em dash* is the longest dash. You can use em dashes to set off a
long qualifier in the middle of a sentence if the use of commas would
hinder readability. If you use em dashes for this purpose, don't use
spaces around them. (For an example, see the second paragraph in the
following section, "Ellipses.")

Don't capitalize the word following an em dash, unless the word is
proper.

Don't use an em dash to separate a long sentence into two parts.
Instead, create two sentences.

An *en dash* is longer than a hyphen and shorter than an em dash. Most
often, you might use an en dash to show a range of numbers in a table
or figure. For example, 10–20 diagrams.

.. note::
   To show a range of numbers in text, use *to* or *through* instead
   of an en dash.

.. _ellipses:

Ellipses
~~~~~~~~

Use an ellipsis (...) in syntax or to indicate omitted code in code
examples.

Don't use an ellipsis in header text of table columns or when showing
the name of an interface element—such as a text box, menu, menu
command, or command button—even if the ellipsis is displayed on the
interface. For example, don't use an ellipsis as follows:

- On the **File** menu, click **Open...**.
- Do this ... *(column header)*

Exclamation points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid using exclamation points.

Hyphens
~~~~~~~

This section provides general guidelines for hyphenation. For
guidelines about using dashes, see `Dashes <#dashes>`__.

-  `Hyphens in compound modifiers <#hyphens-in-compound-modifiers>`__
-  `Hyphens with prefixes <#hyphens-with-prefixes>`__

.. _hyphens-in-compound-modifiers:

Hyphens in compound modifiers
-----------------------------

When two or more words precede and modify a noun as a unit (also called
a *compound modifier*), use hyphens according to the following
guidelines.

- To clarify meaning, use a hyphen. For example, *high-level-language
  compiler* is clearer than *high level language compiler.*

- Words that you hyphenate as compound modifiers preceding a noun might
  not be hyphenated in other parts of a sentence or when used as
  another part of speech. Hyphenate only if needed for clarity. For
  example, *local-level attributes* but *attributes defined at the
  local level*.

  **Note:** One exception is *up-to-date*, which is hyphenated in any
  position in a sentence.

- If the first component of a compound modifier is a number, use a
  hyphen. For example, *32-bit operating system*.

- If the first word of a compound modifier is an adverb ending in
  *-ly*, don't hyphenate the modifier. For example, *fully qualified
  domain name*.

- If one of the elements of a compound modifier is a trademark, don't
  hyphenate the modifier. For example, *Java specific*, not
  *Java-specific*.

Hyphens with prefixes
---------------------

Words with prefixes aren't usually hyphenated. However, a hyphen might
be necessary in the following cases:

-  You need to distinguish between homographs, such as *re-create* and
   *recreate*.

-  The last letter of the prefix and the first letter of the root word
   are the same. Exceptions are words such as *reenter* and
   *preemptive*, which aren't likely to be misread.

-  The product team has hyphenated a term with a prefix, and you need
   to follow suit in the docs for consistency with the interface.
   Whenever possible, work with the teams to use preferred spelling.

For the correct formatting of a specific word, see a dictionary or
:ref:`alphabetical-list-of-terms`. For more information about
hyphenating prefixes, see `The Chicago Manual of Style
<https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/HyphensEnDashesEmDashes/faq0079.html>`__.

Parentheses
~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid parentheses in running text. Parenthetical text can distract the
reader from the main idea of the sentence and disrupt the flow of the
sentence. When possible, put parenthetical information in a separate
sentence.

Following are some acceptable uses for parentheses:

-  To define an abbreviation
-  To show a special character
-  To show examples
-  To show a concise phrase that qualifies a term, title, or step

Don't add *(s)* or *(es)* to the end of a noun to indicate the
possibility of more than one item. Use the singular form or the plural
form, or use both forms joined by a conjunction.

   * - An access control list (ACL) allows access from an outside
       network into the ObjectRocket system.

       Object names can't contain characters such as dollar signs ($)

       DNS is analogous to a phone book in that it assigns a numerical
       identifier (for example, 210.48.108.35) to a particular name
       (for example, www.diversity.net.nz).

       You can submit up to 10 messages (the default) in a single
       request.

Periods
~~~~~~~

Use the following guidelines for periods. For basic period usage, see a
grammar reference, `section 6.12, Periods
<https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/part2/ch06/psec012.html>`__
in the *Chicago Manual of Style*.

- Use a period at the end of a declarative or imperative sentence, and
  insert only one space after the period.

- Place periods inside quotation marks, unless the quotation marks are
  part of a literal string. In such cases, place the period outside the
  quotation mark.

- Use periods in list items as follows:

  - If all of the items in a list are sentences, including imperative
    statements, end each item with a period.
  - If all of the items in a list are fragments, don't end the items
    with a period.
  - In a list of fragments, some or all of which are followed by
    sentences, end every fragment and sentence in the list with a
    period. For example, see the "Lists" topic.


- Use periods with abbreviations that could be misread as a word, such
  as *in.* (for *inch*).

- Precede a file name extension with a period.  Also, assume that the
  period in a file name extension is pronounced as *dot*, and use the
  indefinite article *a*. For example, a .**ini** file.

- Don't end a title or a heading with a period.

.. _quotation-marks:

Quotation marks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to quotation marks as *quotation marks*, not as *quote marks* or
*quotes*.

Use single and double quotation marks according to the following guidelines:

- Use quotation marks in user entries or syntax only if the software
  requires the quotation marks.

- Use quotation marks in message text only if the product shows
  quotation marks in the generated message. Use code font (monospace)
  to format messages.

- If you use a term in a unique or qualified sense, use double
  quotation marks in text only at its first occurrence, and omit the
  quotation marks in subsequent occurrences of the term. For example:

  The spelling checker "learns" the word. After it learns the word, the
  spelling checker ignores subsequent occurrences of the word in the document.

- Include appropriate punctuation, such as periods and commas, inside
  quotation marks unless the quotation marks are part of the syntax
  that the user must type.

- Don't use quotation marks for emphasis. Use italics instead, or other
  formatting as described in the "Text formatting" topic.

- Use quotation marks to enclose text that's used verbatim from another
  source, or to enclose quotations from people.

Semicolons
~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid using semicolons, which are often misused and, even when used
correctly, can make sentences longer and more difficult to understand.

- Instead of connecting independent clauses with a semicolon, break
  them into separate sentences.
- Instead of connecting more than two items with semicolons, create a
  list.

Slashes
~~~~~~~

Don't use a slash mark (/) to present a choice among, or a series of,
actions or objects. Rewrite the phrase to eliminate the slash mark.
Exceptions are established terms like *client/server* and *read/write*.

Don't use a slash in dates. For information about how to format dates,
see :ref:`dates`.
