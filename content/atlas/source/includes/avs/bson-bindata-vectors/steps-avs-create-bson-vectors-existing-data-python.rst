   :style: normal 

   .. include:: /includes/avs/bson-bindata-vectors/steps-shared-python.rst 

   .. step:: Connect to the |service| {+cluster+} and retrieve existing data. 

      You must provide the following: 
      
      - Connection string to connect to your |service| {+cluster+} that
        contains the database and collection for which you want to
        generate embeddings.
      - Name of the database that contains the collection for which you
        want to generate embeddings.
      - Name of the collection for which you want to generate embeddings.

      To retrieve the data, copy, paste, and run the sample code below
      after replacing the placeholder values (highlighted in the code):

      .. list-table:: 
         :widths: 30 70 
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Placeholder 
           - Valid Value 

         * - ``<CONNECTION-STRING>``
           - Cluster connection string. To learn more, see
             :ref:`connect-via-driver`.  

         * - ``<DATABASE-NAME>``
           - Name of the database that contains the collection for which
             you want to generate and convert embeddings. For this
             example, specify ``sample_airbnb``.

         * - ``<COLLECTION-NAME>``
           - Name of the collection for which you want to generate and
             convert embeddings. For this example, specify

         * - ``<TEXT-FIELD-NAME>``
           - Name of the text field for which you want to generate
             embeddings. For this example, specify ``summary``.

         :copyable: true 
         :language: python
         :linenos:
         :emphasize-lines: 4-6, 9

   .. step:: Generate, convert, and load embeddings into your collection. 

      The sample code performs the following actions:
     
      a. Generates embeddings from your data using any embedding 
         model if your data doesn't already have embeddings. To learn 
         more about generating embeddings from your data, see 
         :ref:`create-vector-embeddings`. 
      #. Converts the embeddings to |bson| vectors (as shown 
         on line 7 in the following example). 
      #. Uploads the embeddings to your collection on the
         |service| {+cluster+}.

      These operation might take a few minutes to complete.

      Copy, paste, and run the code below after replacing the following
      placeholder values (highlighted in the code):

      .. list-table:: 
         :widths: 30 70 
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Placeholder 
           - Valid Value 

         * - ``<EMBEDDING-MODEL>``
           - Embedding model to use for generating the embeddings. For
             this example, specify ``voyage-3-large``. 

         * - ``<NUMBER-OF-DIMENSIONS>``
           - Number of dimensions for the resulting output embeddings.
             For this example, specify ``1024``.

         * - ``<FIELD-NAME-FOR-FLOAT32-TYPE>``
           - Name of field with ``float32`` values.

         * - ``<FIELD-NAME-FOR-INT8-TYPE>``
           - Name of field with ``int8`` values.

         * - ``<FIELD-NAME-FOR-INT1-TYPE>``
           - Name of field with ``int1`` values. 

         * - ``<EMBEDDING-MODEL>``
           - Embedding model to use for generating the embeddings. For
             this example, specify ``voyage-3-large``.

         * - ``<TEXT-FIELD-NAME>``
           - Name of the text field for which you generated
             embeddings. For this example, specify ``summary``.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/avs/bson-bindata-vectors/python/generate-embeddings-existing-data.py

         :language: python
         :linenos:
         :emphasize-lines: 1-5, 10

   .. step:: Create the {+avs+} index on the collection.

      You can create {+avs+} indexes by using the {+atlas-ui+},
      {+atlas-cli+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, and MongoDB drivers. To learn
      more, see :ref:`avs-types-vector-search`. 

      To create the index, copy, paste, and run the sample code below after
      replacing the following placeholder value (highlighted in the code):  

      .. list-table:: 
         :widths: 30 70 
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Placeholder 
           - Valid Value 

         * - ``<INDEX-NAME>``
           - Name of ``vector`` type index. 
            
      .. io-code-block::

            New search index named <INDEX-NAME> is building.
            Polling to check if the index is ready. This may take up to a minute.
            <INDEX-NAME> is ready for querying.

   .. step:: Run {+avs+} queries on the collection. 

      a. Define a function to run a vector search query.

         The function to run {+avs+} queries performs the following
         actions:
         
         - Generates embeddings using Voyage AI for the query text.
         - Converts the embeddings to |bson| vectors. 
         - Defines the aggregation pipeline for the vector search.
         - Runs the aggregation pipeline and returns the results.

         .. list-table:: 
            :widths: 30 70 
            :header-rows: 1

            * - Placeholder

            * - ``<NUMBER-OF-CANDIDATES-TO-CONSIDER>`` 
              - Number of nearest neighbors to use during the search.
                For this example, specify ``20``

            * - ``<NUMBER-OF-DOCUMENTS-TO-RETURN>`` 
              - Number of documents to return in the results. For this
                example, specify ``5``.

            * - ``<TEXT-FIELD-NAME>`` 
              - Name of the field that contains the text data. For this
                example, specify ``summary``.

            :emphasize-lines: 37-38, 22, 44

      #. Run the {+avs+} query.

         You can run {+avs+} queries programmatically. To learn more, see
         :ref:`return-vector-search-results`.
