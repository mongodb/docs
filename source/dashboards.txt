Dashboards are a collection of charts assembled to create a single
unified display of your data. Each chart shows data from a
single MongoDB collection or view, so dashboards are essential to
attain insight into multiple focal points of your data in a single
display. Dashboards can be shared with other users.

Dashboards Page
---------------

The :guilabel:`Dashboards` page shows all dashboards you have access to view. 
To get to your project's :guilabel:`Dashboards` page, click :guilabel:`Charts` in the |service| navigation bar. 

To learn more about dashboard permissions in |charts|, see :ref:`Dashboard Permissions <dashboard-permissions>`.

   :alt: Charts Dashboard Tab

Each dashboard shows the following information:

- Title

- Description

- A preview of the first three charts in the dashboard, including the
  chart title and type

- When the dashboard was last modified

By default, the most recently modified dashboards are shown first in
the list. You can change the sort order by using the
:guilabel:`Sort By` dropdown menu.

Add a Sample Dashboard
----------------------

|charts| provides several sample dashboards that use various sample 
data sources. You can add a sample dashboard to explore different 
examples of charts you can create.

.. tip::
   
   You can add a new sample dashboard even if you have an existing 
   sample dashboard in your |charts-short| project. This can be useful 
   if you have changed a sample dashboard and want a fresh copy.

To add a sample dashboard:

.. procedure:: Create a Sample Dashboard
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: From the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page, 
      expand the :guilabel:`Add Dashboard` dropdown menu and select :guilabel:`Add sample dashboard`. 

   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Add sample dashboard` modal, 
      select a category of sample data with which to create a sample dashboard. 
      You can choose from the following sample dashboards: 

      - `Product event metadata <https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-embedding-examples-wgffp/public/dashboards/63f6f973-045a-4862-83f4-514e7d2df8fc?ajs_event=Link%20from%20Charts%20docs&ajs_prop_referrer=https://www.mongodb.com/docs/charts/>`__

      .. note:: 
      
         Each of the above links provides a public preview version of 
         a sample dashboard where you can experiment with 
         :ref:`dashboard filtering <dashboard-filtering>` 
         and :ref:`interactive filtering <interact-with-charts>`.
   
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Add and Open` 
      to create a new :guilabel:`Sample Dashboard` of which you are the ``Owner``.

You can also create a :guilabel:`Sample Dashboard` by going through 
the |charts-short| :ref:`Welcome Experience <welcome-experience>`.

Sample Dashboard Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sample dashboards come with preset example dashboard filters. You can 
adjust these filters to modify the data that appears on your dashboard. 
To learn more about filtering dashboard data, see 
:ref:`dashboard-filtering`. 

Add a Billing Dashboard
-----------------------

You can add a billing dashboard in |charts-short|
to visualize your |service| billing data. Billing dashboards
contain prebuilt charts with insights into your |service| 
usage. To learn more, see :ref:`billing-dashboards`.

.. _refresh-dashboard-overview:

Refresh Dashboard Data
----------------------
 
|charts| automatically refreshes chart data once it becomes out of
date with the backing data source. You can also manually refresh
dashboard data at any time.

To learn how to configure refresh settings and underlying
refresh behavior, see :doc:`/dashboard-refresh`.

.. _get-chart-data-dashboard:
.. _view-chart-data-dashboard:

View Chart Data
---------------

The data underlying a chart can be exported as a table. All viewers of 
public dashboards and authenticated users of non-public dashboards can 
view and export data. To view the chart data, click :guilabel:`View 
chart data` from the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` menu. Each row in the table 
represents a data point.

.. include:: /includes/get-chart-data-details.rst

.. _import-export-dashboard:

Export and Import a Dashboard 
-----------------------------

You can export a dashboard to a file, which you can then import. Use 
this feature to:

- Store your dashboard outside of |charts|
- Import exported charts into the same or a different project

.. _export-dashboard:

Export a Dashboard to a File 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can export a dashboard to a single file named 
``<Dashboard-Title>.charts``. 
You can export a dashboard from the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page or from 
the dashboard itself. 

To export a dashboard:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: If you are on the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page, click the ellipsis 
      (``...``) for the dashboard you want to export. If you are already viewing a specific dashboard, click the ellipsis 
      (``...``) in the top right corner.

   .. step:: Click 
      :guilabel:`Export as .charts`. 

The ``<Dashboard-Title>.charts`` file contains the metadata for the 
dashboard, including:

- Dashboard name and description
- Dashboard layout including location of the charts in the dashboard 
- Chart definitions
- Dashboard filter definitions
- Details of the data sources used on the charts including:

  - Cluster name
  - Database name
  - Collection name 

- Embedding settings for each chart including:

  - Whether each embedding type is enabled or disabled
  - Filter allow list
  - Injected filter code 

The ``<Dashboard-Title>.charts`` file does **not** include: 

- Dashboard :ref:`permissions <dashboard-permissions>`
- External sharing settings for the data sources used
- Data source pipelines
- Chart embedding IDs

You must have ``Viewer`` or higher :ref:`permissions 
<dashboard-permissions>` to export a dashboard.





.. _import-dashboard:

Import a Dashboard From a File 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can import a dashboard from a file on the :ref:`Dashboards page 
<dashboards-tab>`. 

The file to import: 

- Can't be larger than 16 MBs
- Must be a valid ``.charts`` file that you downloaded from a 
  dashboard

To import a dashboard from a file: 

.. procedure:: Import a Dashboard From a File
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: From the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page, 
      expand the :guilabel:`Add Dashboard` dropdown menu and select :guilabel:`Import Dashboard`. 

   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Import Dashboard` modal, drag and drop the file to import 
      or click :guilabel:`Choose File` and select the file to import.

   .. step:: Click 
      :guilabel:`Next`.

   .. step:: Click the pencil icon :icon-fa4:`pencil` 
      under :guilabel:`Data source at destination`.

   .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Data source at destination` 
      for each :guilabel:`Data source in file`.
   
      The :guilabel:`Import Dashboard` modal displays a list of all of the data
      sources you are importing under the :guilabel:`Data source in file` column. 
      To connect each data source from your imported dashboard to a data source in your destination project, 
      choose one of the following options under the :guilabel:`Data Source at Destination` column: 

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 15 40  

         * - Option 
           - Description 
       
         * - :guilabel:`Connect later`
           - Option to choose the data source to use later. |charts| 
             imports all charts using the :guilabel:`Data source in file`, 
             but no data source is selected. The charts don't render until 
             you edit each chart and choose a new data source. 

         * - :guilabel:`Connect now`
           - Option to select any data source in your project. The data 
             source you select is used instead of the :guilabel:`Data 
             source in file` for charts imported in to the dashboard.

             If |charts| detects that a data source in your imported dashboard is the same 
             as the data source in your destination project, that data source is selected by 
             default. Otherwise, :guilabel:`Connect later` is selected by default.

             To select a data source:

             1. Select a deployment from the first dropdown.
             #. Select a database from the second dropdown.
             #. Select a data source from the third dropdown.
             #. Click :guilabel:`Save`. 

         * - :guilabel:`Exclude charts using this data source`
           - Option to exclude charts that use the :guilabel:`Data source 
             in file`. Charts that use the :guilabel:`Data source in 
             file` won't be imported.

   .. important::

      Imported charts may not render properly if mapped to a data 
      source that the chart wasn't built to use.

   .. step:: Click one of the 
      following buttons: 

      - :guilabel:`Save` to import the dashboard. 
      - :guilabel:`Save and Import Another` to import this dashboard and 
        import another dashboard from a file.
      - :guilabel:`Cancel` to exit the modal without importing the 
        dashboard.

.. _fullscreen-view:

Fullscreen Dashboard View
-------------------------

|charts| provides a fullscreen view for dashboards. In this view,
|charts| hides the main navigation bar and expands the dashboard to
show the title, description, time of last modification, and charts in
the entire space of the screen.

To enter the fullscreen view for dashboards: 

.. procedure:: Import a Dashboard From a File
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Select a dashboard from the 
      :guilabel:`Dashboards` page.
   
   .. step:: Click
      :icon-fa5:`expand` at the top-right of the dashboard.

.. note::

   In the fullscreen view for dashboards, you can still:
   
   - :ref:`Remove <dashboard-remove-chart>`, :ref:`resize
     <dashboard-resize-chart>`, :ref:`rearrange
     <dashboard-rearrange-chart>`, and :ref:`edit
     <dashboard-edit-chart>` charts by hovering over the desired chart.

   - Configure refresh settings and manually refresh chart data.
   
   - Enter the :ref:`fullscreen charts view <fullscreen-charts-view>`.

To exit the fullscreen view for dashboards, do one of the following 
tasks:

- Click :icon-fa5:`compress` at 
  the top-right of the dashboard.

- Press the escape key.
