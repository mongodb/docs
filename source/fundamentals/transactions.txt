Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the
{+driver-short+} to perform **transactions**. Transactions allow you
to run a series of operations that do not change any data until the
entire transaction is committed. If any operation in the transaction fails, the 
driver aborts the transaction and discards all data changes before they
ever become visible. This feature is called **atomicity**.

Since all write operations on a single document in MongoDB are atomic, you
might want to use transactions to make an atomic change that
modifies multiple documents. This situation would require a multi-document transaction.
Multi-document transactions are **ACID compliant** because MongoDB
guarantees that the data involved in your transaction operations remains
consistent, even if the driver encounters unexpected errors.

To learn more about ACID compliance and transactions, see our :website:`article on
ACID transactions </basics/acid-transactions>`.

.. note::

   To execute a multi-document transactions, you must be connected to a
   deployment running MongoDB Server version 4.0 or later.

   For a detailed list of limitations, see the :manual:`Transactions and
   Operations </core/transactions/#transactions-and-operations>` section in
   the Server manual.

In MongoDB, multi-document transactions run within a **client session**.
A client session is a grouping of related read or write operations that
you want to execute sequentially. We recommend you reuse
your client for multiple sessions and transactions instead of
instantiating a new client each time.

When combined with majority read and
write concerns, the driver can guarantee causal consistency between the
operations. See the server manual guide on
:manual:`Client Sessions and Causal Consistency Guarantees </core/read-isolation-consistency-recency/#std-label-sessions>`
for more information.

Learn more about how to use the driver to run multi-document transactions on
MongoDB in the following sections of this guide:

- :ref:`Transaction Settings <nodejs-transaction-settings>`
- :ref:`Core API Examples <nodejs-transaction-examples>`

.. _nodejs-transaction-apis:

Transaction APIs
----------------

Use the **Core API** to implement a transaction with the driver. To use the Core
API, you declare the start and commit points of the transaction.

Core API
~~~~~~~~

The Core API features methods to start, cancel, or commit a transaction.
When you commit the transaction, you send a request to the server to make the
changes from your operations atomically. When using this API, you must handle
certain transaction errors returned by the server manually.

See
:manual:`TransientTransactionError </core/transactions-in-applications/#std-label-transient-transaction-error>`
and
:manual:`UnknownTransactionCommitResult </core/transactions-in-applications/#-unknowntransactioncommitresult->`
for more information on these errors.

To start, cancel, or commit your transaction, you can call the corresponding
method on the ``Session`` object:

- ``startTransaction()``
- ``commitTransaction()``
- ``abortTransaction()``

See the :ref:`Core API example <nodejs-transaction-core-api-example>` for
a sample transaction implementation.

.. _nodejs-transaction-settings:

Transaction Settings
--------------------

When you instantiate a transaction, you can specify the following options to
set the default behavior for that transaction:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description

   * - ``readConcern``
     - Specifies how to check for the consistency of the data that the
       read operations retrieve from replica sets.

       See :manual:`Read Concern </reference/read-concern/>` in the server
       manual for more information.

   * - ``writeConcern``
     - Specifies conditions in which to acknowledge the write.
       See :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>` in the
       server manual for more information.

   * - ``readPreference``
     - See :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference/#read-preference>`
       in the server manual for more information.

   * - ``maxCommitTimeMS``
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time to allow a commit action on a
       transaction to run in milliseconds.

If you do not provide values, the driver uses the client settings.

You can specify the transaction options in the Core API using code that
resembles the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const transactionOptions = {
     readPreference: 'primary',
     readConcern: { level: 'local' },
     writeConcern: { w: 'majority' },
     maxCommitTimeMS: 1000
   };
   session.startTransaction(transactionOptions);

.. _nodejs-transaction-examples:

Examples
--------

Consider a scenario in which a customer purchases items from your online
store. To record the purchase, your application needs to update
information related to inventory, the customer's orders, and register the
order details. Suppose you organize the data updates as follows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Collection
     - Operation
     - Description of the Change

   * - ``orders``
     - insert
     - Record the purchase information

   * - ``customers``
     - update
     - Append the order id to associate it with the customer

   * - ``inventory``
     - update
     - Subtract quantity of ordered items

A purchase can fail several ways such as if there's insufficient quantity of
the item in inventory, if the order couldn't be completed, or if your
payment system is offline.

If the payment fails, you can use a transaction to make sure that you
avoid exposing any partial updates that might cause data consistency issues
for other operations that depend on that data.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The code examples require the following sample data in the ``testdb``
database to run the multi-document payment transaction:

- A document in the ``customers`` collection that describes a customer and
  their orders.
- Documents in the ``inventory`` collection that each track quantity and
  description of an item.

The document in the ``customers`` collection in this example contains the
following:

.. code-block:: json

   { _id: 98765, orders: [] }

The documents in the ``inventory`` collection in this example contain the
following:

.. code-block:: json

   [
    { name: "sunblock", sku: 5432, qty: 85 },
    { name: "beach towel", sku: 7865, qty: 41 }
   ]

The code examples also perform operations on the ``orders`` collection, but
do not require any prior sample documents.

The code examples use the ``cart`` and ``payment`` variables to represent
a sample list of items purchased and the order payment details as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const cart = [
     { name: 'sunblock', sku: 5432, qty: 1, price: 5.19 },
     { name: 'beach towel', sku: 7865, qty: 2, price: 15.99 }
   ];
   const payment = { customer: 98765, total: 37.17 };

.. important::

   The examples in the following sections require that you create the
   collections outside of the transaction or that you are using MongoDB 4.4 or
   later. For more information on creating collections inside a transaction,
   see the
   :manual:`Create Collections and Indexes in a Transaction </core/transactions/#std-label-transactions-create-collections-indexes>`
   server guide.

.. _nodejs-transaction-core-api-example:

Core API Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code example in this section demonstrates how you can use the Core API to
run the multi-document payment transaction in a session. This function
shows how you can perform the following:

1. Start a session
#. Start a transaction, specifying transaction options
#. Perform data operations in the same session
#. Commit a transaction, or cancel it if the driver encounters an error
#. End a session

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/transactions/txn-core.js
   :language: javascript
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 2-6,8,10,19,32,41,49,51,55-59,63,65
   :start-after: start placeOrder
   :end-before: end placeOrder

You must pass the session object to each CRUD operation that
you want to run on that session.

.. important:: Use a Session with the Client That Started It
   
   Starting in version 6.0 of the {+driver-short+}, the driver 
   throws an error if you provide a session from one ``MongoClient``
   instance to a different client instance.

   For example, the following code generates an
   ``MongoInvalidArgumentError`` error because it creates
   a ``ClientSession`` instance from the ``client1`` client, but provides
   this session to the ``client2`` client for a write operation:

   .. code-block:: js
      :emphasize-lines: 2
      
      const session = client1.startSession();
      client2.db('myDB').collection('myColl').insertOne({ name: 'Jane Eyre' }, { session });

The code and comments in the ``catch`` block demonstrate how you can identify
the server transaction errors and where you can place your logic to handle
them. Make sure to include the ``MongoError`` type from the driver in your
code as shown in the following sample import statement:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const { MongoError, MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

See the :ref:`Payment Transaction Result <nodejs-transaction-example-payment-result>`
section to see what your collections should contain after you run the
transaction.

.. _nodejs-transaction-example-payment-result:

Payment Transaction Result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application completes the payment transaction, your
database should contain all the updates, and if an exception interrupted your
transaction, none of the changes should exist in your database.

The ``customers`` collection should contain the customer document with an
order id appended to the orders field:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     "_id": 98765,
     "orders": [
       "61dc..."
     ]
   }

The ``inventory`` collection should contain updated quantities for the
items "sunblock" and "beach towel":

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   [
     {
       "_id": ...,
       "name": "sunblock",
       "sku": 5432,
       "qty": 84
     },
     {
       "_id": ...,
       "name": "beach towel",
       "sku": 7865,
       "qty": 39
     }
   ]

The ``orders`` collection should contain the order and payment
information:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   [
     {
       "_id": "...",
       "customer": 98765,
       "items": [
         {
           "name": "sunblock",
           "sku": 5432,
           "qty": 1,
           "price": 5.19
         },
         {
           "name": "beach towel",
           "sku": 7865,
           "qty": 2,
           "price": 15.99
         }
       ],
       "total": 37.17
     }
   ]
