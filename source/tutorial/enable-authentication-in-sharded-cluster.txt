   Support for authentication with sharded clusters.

Overview
--------

When authentication is enabled on a sharded cluster every client that
accesses the cluster must provide credentials. This includes MongoDB
instances that access each other within the cluster.

To enable authentication on a sharded cluster, you must enable
authentication individually on each component of the cluster. This means
enabling authentication on each :binary:`~bin.mongos` and each
:binary:`~bin.mongod`, including each config server, and all members
of a shard's replica set.

Authentication requires an authentication mechanism and, in most cases, a
:setting:`keyfile <keyFile>`. The content of the key file must be the
same on all cluster members.

Consideration
-------------

It is not possible to convert an existing sharded cluster that does
not enforce access control to require authentication without taking
all components of the cluster offline for a short period of time.
