content: |

  a. Create a file named ``facet-query.go``. 
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the
     ``facet-query.go`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:
      
     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Uses the following searchMeta clauses to query the collection: 

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/fts-facet-constant-desc.rst 

     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.
