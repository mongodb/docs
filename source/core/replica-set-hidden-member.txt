Hidden Replica Set Members
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

A hidden member maintains a copy of the :term:`primary's <primary>`
data set but is **invisible** to client applications. Hidden members
are ideal for workloads with different usage patterns from the other
members in the :term:`replica set`. Hidden members are also
:ref:`priority 0 members <replica-set-secondary-only-members>` and
**cannot become primary**. The :method:`db.isMaster()` method does not
display hidden members. Hidden members, however, **do vote** in
:ref:`elections <replica-set-elections>`.

In the following five-member replica set, all four secondary members
have copies of the primary's data set, but one of the secondary members
is hidden.

Secondary reads do not reach a hidden member, so the member receives
no traffic beyond what replication requires. It can be useful to keep a hidden
member dedicated to reporting or to do backups.

For dedicated backup, ensure that the hidden member has low
network latency to the primary or likely primary. Ensure that the
:term:`replication lag` is minimal or non-existent.

It is best not to shut down a hidden node. Instead, for filesystem
snapshots, it is preferable to use :method:`db.fsyncLock()` to flush all
writes and lock the :program:`mongod` instance for the duration of the
backup.

see :doc:`/core/backups`. To configure a hidden member, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-a-hidden-replica-set-member`.
