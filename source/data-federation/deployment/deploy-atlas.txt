This page describes how to deploy a {+fdi+} for 
accessing data in an |service| cluster.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, you will need to:

- Create a `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_atlas>`__ 
  account, if you do not have one already.
- Create an :ref:`Atlas Cluster <create-new-cluster>`, if you do not 
  have one already. {+adf+} supports |service| clusters
  deployed to |aws|, |azure|, or |gcp|.

  .. note::

     To use your |service| cluster as a data store, you must deploy it 
     to the same project as your {+fdi+}.

- Add data to at least one collection on your |service| cluster if you
  have not already.
