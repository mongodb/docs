Introduction
------------

|service| provides the following ways to monitor your cluster's performance.

Performance Metrics
-------------------

|service| collects and displays metrics on the state of your cluster's
databases and on server usage. Metrics provide an indication of when you must
modify your database configuration or add server capacity. See
:doc:`monitor-cluster-metrics`.

Alerts
------

|service| notifies you when your database operations or server usage
reach thresholds that affect your cluster's performance. See:

- :doc:`/respond-to-alerts`

- :doc:`/configure-alerts`

MongoDB Logs
------------

Each :program:`mongod <bin.mongod>` and :program:`mongos <bin.mongos>` process keeps an account of its
activity in a log file. To view logs, click :guilabel:`Clusters`, then the
:guilabel:`MongoDB Logs` tab. Refresh your browser to view new entries. For
information on reading MongoDB logs, see :manual:`Log Messages
</reference/log-messages>` in the MongoDB manual.

You can optionally disable log collection for your group. |service| will
continue to display previously collected log entries but will cease to collect
new log data. To disable log collection, click :guilabel:`Settings`, then
:guilabel:`Group Settings`. Set :guilabel:`Collect Logs For All Hosts` to
:guilabel:`Off`.
