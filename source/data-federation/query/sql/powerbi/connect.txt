This page describes how to connect to a {+cluster+} with {+asql+} and
Power BI using the Power BI Connector.

Prerequisites
-------------

- An |service| {+cluster+} running MongoDB version 5.0 or later.

- `Power BI Desktop <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/desktop-get-the-desktop/>`__ 64 bit. Microsoft
  updates and releases Power BI monthly, and |service| supports only
  the latest version of Power BI Desktop.

- Windows operating system. To learn the Windows OS versions that
  Power BI Desktop supports, see `Power BI System Requirements
  <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494>`__.

Procedure
---------

Follow these steps to enable {+asql+} and connect with Power BI.

.. procedure::
   :style:  normal
   
   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst
   
   .. step:: Enable {+asql+}.

      a. Under :guilabel:`Atlas SQL`, click :guilabel:`Connect`.

         i. On the lower right side of the {+cluster+} card under
            :guilabel:`Atlas SQL`, click :guilabel:`Connect`. 
         #. If the :guilabel:`Introducing the Atlas SQL Interface`
            dialog box displays, click :guilabel:`Get Started`.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Quick Start`

         :guilabel:`Quick Start` configures a {+fdi+} for your
         {+cluster+} with the default settings. 
            
         To set up :guilabel:`Advanced Configuration`,
         including querying across |service| data sources or
         limiting the namespaces to query, you must :ref:`Manually Create a Federated Database Instance for Atlas SQL <gst-deploy-adf>`.

      #. Under :guilabel:`Create an Atlas SQL Connection for this cluster`, click :guilabel:`Create`.

      #. Under :guilabel:`Select your driver`, select :guilabel:`Power BI Connector`.

      #. Under :guilabel:`Get Connection String`, select a database and copy the :guilabel:`URL`.

         The URL is required to connect from Power BI Desktop.

   .. step:: Download the MongoDB ODBC Driver.

      Download the installer for the latest `MongoDB ODBC Driver <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/odbc-driver/>`__.

      .. note::
         
         To use :ref:`<direct-query-mode>`, you must install MongoDB ODBC Driver version 1.2 or later.

   .. step:: Download and install the MongoDB Atlas Power BI Connector.

      .. note:: The MongoDB Atlas Power BI Connector is included with Power BI Desktop.
                If your version of Power BI Desktop already has the MongoDB connector, you can skip this step.
                To use a different version than the one bundled with Power BI Desktop, complete this step.

      a. Download `the connector file <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/power-bi-connector/>`__. 
      
      #. Move the connector file to the following directory path: ``C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors``.

         Create this folder if it doesn't already exist.

   .. step:: Connect from Power BI Desktop.

      a. Open Power BI Desktop.

      #. Select :guilabel:`Get data` from the :guilabel:`Home` menu.

      #. Find and select the :guilabel:`MongoDB Atlas SQL` connector.
            
         i. Type ``mongo`` in the search bar to find the new connector.
         #. Select :guilabel:`MongoDB Atlas SQL`.
         #. Click :guilabel:`Connect`.

      #. Enter the URI and the database name and click :guilabel:`OK`.

         The :guilabel:`MongoDB URI` is the URL is the from the previous step.

         You can also enter a SQL query in the 
         :guilabel:`Native query` field. Power BI uses the SQL
         query as the direct source for the data.

      #. Enter your Atlas :guilabel:`User name` and :guilabel:`Password` and click :guilabel:`Connect`.

         By default, a user can access all {+clusters+} and {+fdi+}s in projects to which they have access. If you restricted
         access to specific {+clusters+} and {+fdi+}s, you can grant
         access to the new {+fdi+} in the Edit User menu. To learn more, see :ref:`modify-mongodb-users`.

.. _direct-query-mode:

Direct Query
------------

Direct Query is a connection mode available with the 
MongoDB Power BI connector version 1.2 and later.
To use Direct Query, you must install 
`MongoDB ODBC Driver <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/odbc-driver/>`__ 
version 1.2 or later.

Direct Query is alternative to the standard Import Mode. Direct Query allows
you to query your database directly, which guarantees up-to-date data, but may
take longer to return results.

Some actions aren't supported by Direct Query. If you 
try to perform an unsupported action, Power BI prompts you to 
switch to Import Mode.
