The Welcome Experience guides you through possible ways of beginning
your use of |charts|. New |charts-short| users or users who have
not previously used dashboards in |charts-short| have the option to
walk through the Welcome Experience. Refer to the following sections for
information on the possible paths that the Welcome Experience offers:

- :ref:`Connect Your Data Sources <welcome-connect-data>`

- :ref:`Explore with Sample Data <welcome-explore-data>`

.. _welcome-connect-data:

Connect Your Data Sources
-------------------------

Use the :guilabel:`Connect Your Data` path to connect your existing
|service| clusters to |charts| and visualize your data. 

Requirements & Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You must have an existing |service| cluster. If you do not have an
  existing |service| cluster, you can :ref:`Explore Charts with Sample
  Data <welcome-explore-data>`.

- You must have read access in your project role to connect
  |charts-short| to your data. To learn more about |service| project
  roles, see :atlas:`Atlas Project Roles
  </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>`

Explore with Sample Data
------------------------

|charts| provides a :ref:`Sample Dashboard <sample-dashboard>` that uses movie data to show
examples of possible charts you can create. You can also use the
:ref:`sample data source <sample-data>` to create your own charts on
other dashboards. 

Procedure

   If you remove the :guilabel:`Sample Dashboard`, you can add it back
   through the :ref:`Charts Settings <admin-settings>` page.
