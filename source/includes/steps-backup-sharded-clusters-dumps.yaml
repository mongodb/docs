title: Disable the balancer process.
stepnum: 1
ref: disable-balancer
pre: |
   Disable the :term:`balancer` process that equalizes the distribution of
   data among the :term:`shards <shard>`. To disable the balancer, use the
   :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. For
   example:
action:
   language: javascript
   code: |
      use config
      sh.setBalancerState(false)
post: |
   For more information, see the
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily` procedure.

   .. warning:: If you do not stop the balancer, the backup could have duplicate data or omit data as :term:`chunks <chunk>` migrate while recording backups. 

---
title: Lock replica set members.
stepnum: 2
ref: lock-replica-set-members
pre: |
   Lock one member of each replica set in each shard so that your backups
   reflect the state of your database at the nearest possible
   approximation of a single moment in time. Lock these :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instances in as short of an interval as possible.

   To lock or freeze a sharded cluster, issue :method:`db.fsyncLock()`
   on a member of each replica set in the cluster. Ensure that the
   :term:`oplog` has sufficient capacity to allow these secondaries to
   catch up to the state of the primaries after finishing the backup
   procedure. See :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing` for more information.
---
title: Backup one config server.
stepnum: 3
ref: backup-config-server
pre: |
   Run :binary:`~bin.mongodump` against a config server :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instance to back up the cluster's metadata. The config server
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance must be version 2.4 or later and must run
   with the :option:`--configsvr <mongod --configsvr>` option. You only need to back up one
   config server.

   Use :binary:`~bin.mongodump` with the :option:`--oplog <mongodump --oplog>` option to
   backup one of the :ref:`config servers <sharding-config-server>`.
action:
   language: sh
   code: |
      mongodump --oplog
---
title: Backup replica set members.
stepnum: 4
ref: backup-replica-set-members
pre: |
   Back up the "frozen" replica set members of the shards using
   :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and specifying the
   :option:`--oplog <mongodump --oplog>` option. You may back up the
   shards in parallel. Consider the following invocation:
action:
   language: sh
   code: |
      mongodump --oplog --out /data/backup/
post: |
   You must run :binary:`~bin.mongodump` on the same system where the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` ran. :binary:`~bin.mongodump` writes the output of
   this dump as well as the ``oplog.bson`` file to the
   ``/data/backup/`` directory.
---
title: Unlock replica set members.
stepnum: 5
ref: restart-replica-set-members
pre: |
   Use :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` to unlock the locked replica set
   members of each shard. Allow these members to catch up with the state
   of the primary.
---
title: Re-enable the balancer process.
stepnum: 6
ref: reenable-balancer-process
pre: |
   Re-enable the balancer with the :method:`sh.setBalancerState()`
   method.

   Use the following command sequence when connected to the
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` with the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:
action:
   language: sh
   code: |
      use config
      sh.setBalancerState(true)
...
