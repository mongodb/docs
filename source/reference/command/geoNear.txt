.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: geoNear

   The :dbcommand:`geoNear` command provides an alternative to the
   :dbcommand:`$near` operator. In addition to the
   functionality of :operator:`$near`, :dbcommand:`geoNear` returns the distance of
   each item from the specified point along with additional diagnostic
   information. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { geoNear : "places" , near : [50,50], num : 10 }

   Here, :dbcommand:`geoNear` returns the 10 items nearest to the
   coordinates ``[50,50]`` in the collection named
   ``places``. `geoNear` provides the following options (specify all
   distances in the same units as the document coordinate system:)

   :field near: Takes the coordinates (e.g. ``[ x, y ]``) to use as
                the center of a geospatial query.

   :field num: Specifies the maximum number of documents to return.

   :field maxDistance: Optional. Limits the results to those falling within
                       a given distance of the center coordinate.

   :field query: Optional. Further narrows the results using any standard
                 MongoDB query operator or selection. See :method:`db.collection.find()`
                 and ":doc:`/reference/operators`" for more
                 information.

   :field spherical: Optional. Default: ``false``. When ``true``
                     MongoDB will return the query as if the
                     coordinate system references points on a
                     spherical plane rather than a plane.

   :field distanceMultiplier: Optional. Specifies a factor to multiply
                             all distances returned by
                             :dbcommand:`geoNear`. For example, use
                             ``distanceMultiplier`` to convert from
                             spherical queries returned in radians to
                             linear units (i.e. miles or kilometers)
                             by multiplying by the radius of the
                             Earth.

                             .. todo:: insert link after merging in geo.
                             
                                .. include :ref:`geospatial-spherical-geometry`
                                   link after geospatial merge.

   :field includeLocs: Optional. Default: ``false``. When specified
                       ``true``, the query will return the location of
                       the matching documents in the result.

   :field uniqueDocs: Optional. Default ``true``. The default settings
                      will only return a matching document once, even
                      if more than one of its location fields match
                      the query. When ``false`` the query will return
                      documents with multiple matching location fields
                      more than once. See :operator:`$uniqueDocs` for
                      more information on this option
