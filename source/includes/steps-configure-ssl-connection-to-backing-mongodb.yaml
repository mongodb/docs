stepnum: 2

ref: configure-onprem
content: |
  Configure the following settings in ``conf-mms.properties``:

  :setting:`mongo.ssl` 

    Set this to ``true`` to indicate that the
    :ref:`mms-application-database` is using SSL.

  :setting:`mongodb.ssl.CAFile` 

    Specify the PEM file that contains the root certificate chain from the
    Certificate Authority that signed the MongoDB server certificate.

  :setting:`mongodb.ssl.PEMKeyFile`

    If the MongoDB instance is running with ``--sslCAFile`` option, specify
    the PEM file containing an x.509 certificate and private key.

  :setting:`mongodb.ssl.PEMKeyFilePassword`

    If the client PEM file contains an encrypted private key, specify the
    password for PEM file. To encrypt this password in the configuration file,
    use the |mms| ``credentialstool`` tool. See :ref:`encrypt-mongodb-user-credentials`.

  .. important::

     On Microsoft Windows servers, file paths for ``mongodb.ssl.CAFile`` and
     ``mongodb.ssl.PEMKeyFile`` must escape their backslashes to work properly.
     If you store your SSL certificates in ``D:\Certificates``, the file path
     would be written as ``D:\\Certificates\\pemkeyfile.pem``.
