Multi-factor authentication provides an additional layer of security for
your |service| account. 

.. important::

   If an :authrole:`Organization Owner` enables |mfa|, all members of that
   organization must also enable |mfa-short| before they can access the
   organization.

When |mfa-short| is enabled, a user must provide their password as well
as verification from another mechanism.

|service| provides the following factors for |mfa|:

- Okta Verify Mobile App
- Google Authenticator
- Email

You can enable one or more authentication mechanisms for your account.
It is recommended that you enable at least two authentication mechanisms
in case you lose access to one of them.

Configure Multi-Factor Authentication
-------------------------------------

.. _disable-legacy-2fa:

If you currently have :ref:`legacy two-factor authentication
<security-two-factor-auth>` set up for your account, you must disable it
before you set up |mfa|.

To disable legacy |2fa|, navigate to your :guilabel:`User Preferences`
panel.

1. Click on the dropdown menu labeled with your name in the upper right
   corner of the |service| UI.
#. Click :guilabel:`User Preferences` in the dropdown menu.
