Deploy a Sharded Cluster
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This document describes how to deploy a :term:`sharded cluster` for a
standalone :program:`mongod` instance. To deploy a cluster for an
existing replica set, see
:doc:`/tutorial/convert-replica-set-to-replicated-shard-cluster`.

Procedure
---------

Before deploying a sharded cluster, see the requirements listed in
:ref:`Requirements for Sharded Clusters <sharding-requirements>`.

.. include:: /includes/warning-sharding-hostnames.rst

Start the Config Server Database Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The config server database processes are small
:program:`mongod` instances that store the cluster's metadata. You must
have exactly *three* instances in production deployments. Each stores a complete copy
of the cluster's metadata. These instances should run on different servers
to assure good uptime and data safety.

Since config database :program:`mongod` instances receive relatively
little traffic and demand only a small portion of system resources, you
can run the instances on systems that run other cluster components.

By default a :program:`mongod` :option:`--configsvr <mongod --configsvr>` process stores its data files
in the `/data/configdb` directory.  You can specify a different
location using the :setting:`dbpath` run-time option. The config :program:`mongod` instance
is accessible via port ``27019``. In addition to :setting:`configsvr`,
use other :program:`mongod`
:doc:`runtime options </reference/configuration-options>` as needed.

To create a data directory for each config server, issue a command
similar to the following for each:

.. code-block:: sh

   mkdir /data/db/config

To start each config server, issue a command similar to the following
for each:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --configsvr --dbpath <path> --port <port>

Start the ``mongos`` Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :program:`mongos` instance routes queries and operations
to the appropriate shards and interacts with the config server instances.
All client operations targeting a cluster go through :program:`mongos`
instances.

:program:`mongos` instances are lightweight and do not require data directories.
A cluster typically
has several instances. For example, you might run one :program:`mongos`
instance on each of your application servers, or you might run a :program:`mongos` instance
on each of the servers running a :program:`mongod` process.

You must the specify resolvable hostnames [#names]_ for the *3* config servers
when starting the :program:`mongos` instance. You specify the hostnames either in the
configuration file or as command line parameters.

The :program:`mongos` instance runs on the default MongoDB TCP port:
``27017``.

To start :program:`mongos` instance running on the
``mongos0.example.net`` host, that connects to the config server
instances running on the following hosts: 

- ``mongoc0.example.net``
- ``mongoc1.example.net``
- ``mongoc2.example.net``

You would issue the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongos --configdb mongoc0.example.net,mongoc1.example.net,mongoc2.example.net

.. [#names] Use DNS names for the config servers rather than explicit
   IP addresses for operational flexibility. If you're not using resolvable
   hostname,
   you cannot change the config server names or IP addresses
   without a restarting *every* :program:`mongos` and
   :program:`mongod` instance.

Add Shards to the Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must deploy at least one :term:`shard` or one :term:`replica set` to
begin. In a production cluster, each shard is a replica set. You
may add additional shards to a running cluster later. For instructions
on deploying replica sets, see :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set`.

This procedure assumes you have two active and initiated replica sets
and describes how to add the first two shards to the cluster.

First, connect to one of the :program:`mongos` instances. For example,
if a :program:`mongos` is accessible at ``mongos0.example.net`` on
port ``27017``, issue the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo mongos0.example.net

Then, from the :program:`mongo` shell connected to the :program:`mongos`
instance, call the :method:`sh.addShard()` method for each shard that
you want to add to the cluster:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.addShard( "sfo30.example.net" )
   sh.addShard( "sfo40.example.net" )

If ``sfo30.example.net`` and ``sfo40.example.net`` are members of a
replica set, MongoDB will discover all other members of the replica
set.

These operations add two shards, provided by:

- the replica set named ``s0``, that includes the
  ``sfo30.example.net`` host.

- the replica set name and ``s1``, that includes the
  ``sfo40.example.net`` host.

.. admonition:: All shards should be replica sets

   .. versionchanged:: 2.0.3

   After version 2.0.3, you may use the above form to add replica
   sets to a cluster. The cluster will automatically discover
   the other members of the replica set and note their names
   accordingly.

   Before version 2.0.3, you must specify the shard in the
   following form: the replica set name, followed by a forward
   slash, followed by a comma-separated list of seeds for the
   replica set. For example, if the name of the replica set is
   ``sh0``, and the replica set were to have three members, then your :method:`sh.addShard` command might resemble:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.addShard( "sh0/sfo30.example.net,sfo31.example.net,sfo32.example.net" )

The :method:`sh.addShard()` helper in the :program:`mongo` shell is a wrapper for
the :dbcommand:`addShard` :term:`database command`.

Enable Sharding for Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While sharding operates on a per-collection basis, you must enable
sharding for each database that holds collections you want to shard. A
single cluster may have many databases, with each database housing
collections.

Use the following operation in a :program:`mongo` shell session
connected to a :program:`mongos` instance in your cluster:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.enableSharding("records")

Where ``records`` is the name of the database that holds the collection
you want to shard. :method:`sh.enableSharding()` is a wrapper
around the :dbcommand:`enableSharding` :term:`database command`. You
can enable sharding for multiple databases in the cluster.

Enable Sharding for Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enable sharding on a per-collection basis. Because
MongoDB uses "range based sharding," you must specify the :term:`shard
key` MongoDB uses to distribute your documents among the
shards. For more information, see the
:ref:`overview of shard keys <sharding-shard-key>`.

To enable sharding for a collection, use the
:method:`sh.shardCollection()` helper in the :program:`mongo` shell.
The helper provides a wrapper around the :dbcommand:`shardCollection`
:term:`database command` and has the following prototype form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection("<database>.<collection>", shard-key-pattern)

Replace the ``<database>.<collection>`` string with the full namespace
of your database, which consists of the name of your database, a dot
(e.g. ``.``), and the full name of the collection. The ``shard-key-pattern``
represents your shard key, which you specify in the same form as you
would an :method:`index <db.collection.ensureIndex()>` key pattern.

Consider the following example invocations of
:method:`sh.shardCollection()`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection("records.people", { "zipcode": 1, "name": 1 } )
   sh.shardCollection("people.addresses", { "state": 1, "_id": 1 } )
   sh.shardCollection("assets.chairs", { "type": 1, "_id": 1 } )
   sh.shardCollection("events.alerts", { "hashed_id": 1 } )

In order, these operations shard:

#. The ``people`` collection in the ``records`` database using the shard key
   ``{ "zipcode": 1, "name": 1 }``.

   This shard key distributes documents by the value of the
   ``zipcode`` field. If a number of documents have the same value for
   this field, then that :term:`chunk` will be :ref:`splitable
   <sharding-shard-key-cardinality>` by the values of the ``name``
   field.

#. The ``addresses`` collection in the ``people`` database using the shard key
   ``{ "state": 1, "_id": 1 }``.

   This shard key distributes documents by the value of the ``state``
   field. If a number of documents have the same value for this field,
   then that :term:`chunk` will be :ref:`splitable
   <sharding-shard-key-cardinality>` by the values of the ``_id``
   field.

#. The ``chairs`` collection in the ``assets`` database using the shard key
   ``{ "type": 1, "_id": 1 }``.

   This shard key distributes documents by the value of the ``type``
   field. If a number of documents have the same value for this field,
   then that :term:`chunk` will be :ref:`splitable
   <sharding-shard-key-cardinality>` by the values of the ``_id``
   field.

#. The ``alerts`` collection in the ``events`` database using the shard key
   ``{ "hashed_id": 1 }``.

   This shard key distributes documents by the value of the
   ``hashed_id`` field. Presumably this is a computed value that
   holds the hash of some value in your documents and is able to
   evenly distribute documents throughout your cluster.
