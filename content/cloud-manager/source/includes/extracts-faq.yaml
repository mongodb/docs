  Can I deploy MongoDB to a cloud provider with |mms|?
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Yes. See :doc:`/tutorial/nav/add-servers`.

  How does an AWS security group affect access to MongoDB instances?
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The AWS security group affects whether MongoDB instances can
  communicate with each other within the deployment and affects access to
  the deployment from MongoDB clients, such as {+mongosh+} or a 
  :manual:`driver </applications/drivers>`. For complete
  documentation on configuring security group rules for |mms| access,
  see :doc:`/reference/firewall-configuration`.

  Is my data safe?
  ++++++++++++++++

  Yes, |mms| uses enterprise-grade hardware co-located in secure data
  centers to store all user data. The {+bagent+} transmits all data
  using SSL. The data is stored and processed on encrypted volumes.
  |mms| requires two-factor authentication to provide any data for
  restores.

  Is there a limit to Backup size?
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  There is currently no limit on the total size of snapshot storage.
  Backup works best for deployments whose total size is less than 2 TB.

  If you wish to use the Backup feature for a larger deployment, please
  `contact us <https://cloud.mongodb.com/links/support>`_ for more
  information.

  configured with |tls|.

  stores at least 3 copies of your data in at least 2 geographic
  locations to ensure redundancy.

ref: faq-host-exposed-to-public-internet
content: |
  Any alerts set to check if your host is exposed to the public internet will
  attempt to connect to your servers occasionally as part of a vulnerability
  check to help test your firewall configuration. This is a weak
  security validation and should not replace other auditing or intrusion
  detection system procedures.

  If you configured a setting called :guilabel:`Exposed Db Host Check`, it is now
  an alert you can edit or disable. Newly created groups have an exposed host
  alert created and activated automatically, along with a {+magent+} down alert.
  Existing groups must set the exposed host alert manually.

  When enabled, this alert runs twice a month, on the first and fifteenth. Once
  |mms| finds an exposed host, the service will try to connect to the exposed host
  every five minutes until the host is no longer accessible. The exposed host
  alert email looks the same as other alert emails.

  |mms| attempts to connect with both the IP address and the non-canonical host
  identifier.
