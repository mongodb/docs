   shell, type this command:
action:
  language: sh
  copyable: true
  code: |
    curl -LO https://fastdl.mongodb.org/osx/mongodb-macos-x86_64-{+release+}.tgz

title: Download the SHA256 file.
stepnum: 2
ref: download-sha-file
action:
  language: sh
  copyable: true
  code: |
    curl -LO https://fastdl.mongodb.org/osx/mongodb-macos-x86_64-{+release+}.tgz.sha256

title: Use the SHA-256 checksum to verify the MongoDB package file.
stepnum: 3
ref: verify-install-file-sha256
action:
  - pre: |
      Compute the checksum of the package file:
    language: sh
    copyable: true
    code: |
      shasum -c mongodb-macos-x86_64-{+release+}.tgz.sha256
  - pre: |
      which should return the following if the checksum matched the downloaded
      package:
    language: sh
    copyable: true
    code: |
      mongodb-macos-x86_64-{+release+}.tgz: OK
