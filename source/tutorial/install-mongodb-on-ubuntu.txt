Install MongoDB on Ubuntu
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Use this tutorial to install MongoDB on Ubuntu Linux systems. The tutorial
uses ``.deb`` packages to install. While Ubuntu includes its own MongoDB
packages, the official MongoDB packages are generally more up-to-date.

.. note::

   If you use an older Ubuntu that does **not** use Upstart (i.e. any
   version before 9.10 "Karmic"), please follow the instructions on the
   :doc:`install-mongodb-on-debian` tutorial.

.. The following include includes two h2 headers:
.. Packages and Control Scripts

.. include:: /includes/list-mongodb-org-packages.rst

You cannot install this package concurrently with the ``mongodb``,
``mongodb-server``, or ``mongodb-clients`` packages provided by Ubuntu.

Run MongoDB
-----------

The MongoDB instance stores its data files in ``/var/lib/mongo``
and its log files in ``/var/log/mongo``, and runs using the ``mongod``
user account. If you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you
**must** modify the access control rights to the ``/var/lib/mongo`` and
``/var/log/mongo`` directories.
