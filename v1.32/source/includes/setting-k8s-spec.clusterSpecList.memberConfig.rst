.. setting:: memberConfig

  *Type*: collection

  Specification for each MongoDB shard and its 
  members in your |multi-cluster|.

  The order of the elements in the object for shard
  must reflect the order of members in the replica set. For example, 
  the first element affects the Pod at index ``0``, the second 
  element affects index ``1``, and so on.
  
  .. example::

     Consider the following example specification for a 
     |multi-cluster| with three replica sets:

     .. code-block:: yaml

        apiVersion: mongodb.com/v1
        kind: MongoDBMultiCluster
        metadata:
          name: multi-replica-set
        spec:
          version: 6.0.0-ent
          type: ReplicaSet
          duplicateServiceObjects: false
          credentials: my-credentials
          opsManager:
            configMapRef:
              name: my-project
          clusterSpecList:
            - clusterName: cluster1.example.com
              members: 2
