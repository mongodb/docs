Encryption at rest, when used in conjunction with transport encryption
and good security policies that protect relevant accounts, passwords,
and encryption keys, can help ensure compliance with security and
privacy standards, including HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and FERPA.

.. _encrypted-storage-engine:

Encrypted Storage Engine
------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-enterprise-only-admonition.rst

.. important:: Available for the WiredTiger Storage Engine only.

MongoDB Enterprise 3.2 introduces a native encryption option for the
WiredTiger storage engine. This feature allows MongoDB to encrypt data
files such that only parties with the decryption key can decode and
read the data.

Encryption Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Changed in version 4.0


   .. include:: /includes/fact-aes.rst

If encryption is enabled, the default encryption mode that MongoDB
Enterprise uses is the ``AES256-CBC`` (or 256-bit Advanced Encryption
Standard in Cipher Block Chaining mode) via OpenSSL. AES-256 uses a
symmetric key; i.e. the same key to encrypt and decrypt text. MongoDB
Enterprise for Linux also supports authenticated encryption
``AES256-GCM`` (or 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard in
Galois/Counter Mode). FIPS mode encryption is also available.

.. note:: AES256-GCM and Filesystem Backups

   .. include:: /includes/fact-aes256-backups.rst

The data encryption process includes:

- Generating a master key.

- Generating keys for each database.

- Encrypting data with the database keys.

- Encrypting the database keys with the master key.

The encryption occurs transparently in the storage layer; i.e. all data
files are fully encrypted from a filesystem perspective, and data only
exists in an unencrypted state in memory and during transmission.

To encrypt all of MongoDB's network traffic, you can use TLS/SSL
(Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer). See
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-clients`.


Key Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: Secure management of the encryption keys is critical.

The database keys are internal to the server and are only paged to disk
in an encrypted format. MongoDB never pages the master key to disk
under any circumstances.

Only the master key is external to the server (i.e. kept separate from
the data and the database keys), and requires external management. To
manage the master key, MongoDB's encrypted storage engine supports two
key management options:

- Integration with a third party key management appliance via the Key
  Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP). **Recommended**

- Local key management via a keyfile.

To configure MongoDB for encryption and use one of the two key
management options, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-encryption`.

Encryption and Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Encryption is not a part of replication:

- Master keys and database keys are not replicated, and

- Data is not natively encrypted over the wire.

Although you could reuse the same key for the nodes, MongoDB recommends
the use of individual keys for each node as well as the use of
transport encryption.

For details, see :ref:`rotate-encryption-keys`.

Audit Log
~~~~~~~~~

Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

.. _security-encryption-at-rest-audit-log:

Use KMIP Server to Manage Keys for Encrypting the MongoDB Audit Log
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Starting in MongoDB 6.0 Enterprise, you can securely manage the keys for
encrypting the MongoDB audit log using an external Key Management
Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) server.

KMIP simplifies the management of cryptographic keys and eliminates the
use of non-standard key management processes.

To use a KMIP server with audit log encryption, configure these settings
and parameters:

- :setting:`auditLog.auditEncryptionKeyIdentifier` setting
- :setting:`auditLog.compressionMode` setting
- :parameter:`auditEncryptionHeaderMetadataFile` parameter
- :parameter:`auditEncryptKeyWithKMIPGet` parameter

For testing audit log encryption, you can also use the
:setting:`auditLog.localAuditKeyFile` setting.

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, if you need to downgrade to an earlier MongoDB
version, you must first disable audit log encryption by removing
:setting:`auditLog.auditEncryptionKeyIdentifier` or
:setting:`auditLog.localAuditKeyFile`. Existing encrypted audit logs
remain encrypted, and you can keep any procedures you have developed for
storage and processing of encrypted logs.

.. note::

   For audit log encryption, the audit log destination must be a
   file. :term:`syslog` cannot be used as the destination.

Unencrypted Audit Log and Process Log
`````````````````````````````````````

This section applies if you are not using an external Key Management
Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) server to manage keys for encrypting
the audit log as shown in the previous section.

The audit log file is not encrypted as a part of MongoDB's encrypted
storage engine. A :binary:`~bin.mongod` running with :ref:`logging
<monitoring-standard-loggging>` may output potentially sensitive
information to log files as a part of normal operations, depending on
the configured :ref:`log verbosity <log-messages-configure-verbosity>`.

Use the :setting:`security.redactClientLogData` setting to prevent
potentially sensitive information from entering the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` process log.
:setting:`~security.redactClientLogData` reduces detail in the log and
may complicate log diagnostics.

See the :ref:`log redaction <monitoring-log-redaction>` manual entry for
more information.

.. _app-level-encryption:

Application Level Encryption
----------------------------

Application Level Encryption provides encryption on a per-field or
per-document basis within the application layer. 

.. versionadded:: 4.2

   MongoDB 4.2-series drivers provides a client-side field level
   encryption framework. For more information, see
   :ref:`manual-csfle-feature`.

To encrypt full documents, write custom encryption and decryption
routines or use a commercial solution.
