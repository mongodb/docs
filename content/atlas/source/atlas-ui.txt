Overview
--------

After loading your data or :ref:`our sample data <sample-data>`, you can
use the {+atlas-ui+} to interact with the data in the following ways: 

- :ref:`Manage Databases <atlas-ui-dbs>` in your
  {+database-deployments+}.

- :ref:`Manage Collections <atlas-ui-collections>` in your
  {+database-deployments+}.

- :ref:`Manage Documents <atlas-ui-docs>` in your collections.

- :ref:`Manage Indexes <atlas-ui-indexes>` on your collections.

- :ref:`Create and run aggregation pipelines <atlas-ui-agg-pipeline>` to
  process data in your collections.

- :ref:`Shard Global Clusters <de-shard-collection-for-global-writes>`
  to distribute large datasets evenly.

- :charts:`Build charts </launch-charts>` to visualize data in your 
  databases and collections.

Required Roles 
--------------

The following table describes the roles required to perform various actions on 
an |service| cluster: 

.. include:: /includes/table-atlas-ui-permissions.rst

{+atlas-ui+} Read Behavior
--------------------------

The {+atlas-ui+} reads from the primary unless the primary is
unavailable. If the primary is unavailable, the {+atlas-ui+}
reads from a non-hidden, non-delayed secondary member.

Disable {+atlas-ui+} Data Interaction
-------------------------------------

To interact with your data in the {+atlas-ui+} as described in the
:ref:`Overview section <atlas-ui-overview>`, the :guilabel:`Data
Explorer` needs to be enabled. Disabling the :guilabel:`Data Explorer`
will not prevent users from building :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>` in the
{+atlas-ui+}.

.. important:: Required Privileges

   To enable or disable :guilabel:`Data Explorer` for a project, you
   must have the :authrole:`Project Owner`  role for the project 
   or the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role on its parent organization.

:guilabel:`Data Explorer` is enabled by default. To disable
:guilabel:`Data Explorer`:

.. include:: /includes/steps-enable-data-explorer.rst

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-disable-de-limitations.rst

To enable :guilabel:`Data Explorer`, set the toggle to :guilabel:`On`.

Troubleshoot 
------------

If you are experiencing issues connecting to your {+database-deployment+} on 
:guilabel:`Data Explorer`, see :ref:`atlas-ui-troubleshoot`.
