The MongoDB balancer is a background process that monitors the number of
:term:`chunks <chunk>` on each :term:`shard`. When the number of chunks on a
given shard reaches specific :ref:`migration thresholds
<sharding-migration-thresholds>`, the balancer attempts to automatically
migrate chunks between shards and reach an equal number of chunks per shard.

The balancing procedure for :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` is
entirely transparent to the user and application layer, though there may be
some performance impact while the procedure takes place.

The balancer runs on the primary of the config server replica set
(CSRS).

Cluster Balancer
----------------

The :term:`balancer` process is responsible for redistributing the
chunks of a sharded collection evenly among the shards for every
sharded collection. By default, the balancer process is always enabled.

To address uneven chunk distribution for a sharded collection, the
balancer :doc:`migrates chunks </core/sharding-balancer-administration>` from
shards with more chunks to shards with a fewer number of chunks. The
balancer migrates the chunks until there is an even
distribution of chunks for the collection across the shards. For details
about chunk migration, see :ref:`chunk-migration-procedure`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-archiveMovedChunks.rst

Chunk migrations carry some overhead in terms of bandwidth and
workload, both of which can impact database performance. [#auto-distribute]_ The
:term:`balancer` attempts to minimize the impact by:

- Restricting a shard to at most one migration at any given time; i.e.
  a shard cannot participate in multiple chunk migrations at the same
  time. To migrate multiple chunks from a shard, the balancer migrates
  the chunks one at a time.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.4

     Starting in MongoDB 3.4, MongoDB can perform parallel chunk
     migrations. Observing the restriction that a shard can participate
     in at most one migration at a time, for a sharded cluster with *n*
     shards, MongoDB can perform at most *n/2* (rounded down)
     simultaneous chunk migrations.

  See also :ref:`chunk-migration-queuing`.

- Starting a balancing round **only** when the difference in the
  number of chunks between the shard with the greatest number of chunks
  for a sharded collection and the shard with the lowest number of
  chunks for that collection reaches the :ref:`migration threshold
  <sharding-migration-thresholds>`.

You may disable the balancer temporarily for maintenance. See
:ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporally` for details.

You can also limit the window during which the balancer runs to prevent
it from impacting production traffic. See :ref:`Schedule the Balancing
Window <sharding-schedule-balancing-window>` for details.

.. note::

   The specification of the balancing window is relative to the local
   time zone of the primary of the config server replica set.

Adding and Removing Shards from the Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding a shard to a cluster creates an imbalance, since the new
shard has no chunks. While MongoDB begins migrating data to the new
shard immediately, it can take some time before the cluster balances. See the
:doc:`/tutorial/add-shards-to-shard-cluster` tutorial for instructions on
adding a shard to a cluster.

Removing a shard from a cluster creates a similar imbalance, since chunks
residing on that shard must be redistributed throughout the cluster. While
MongoDB begins draining a removed shard immediately, it can take some time
before the cluster balances. *Do not* shutdown the servers associated
to the removed shard during this process. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-remove-shard-balance-order.rst

See the :doc:`/tutorial/remove-shards-from-cluster` tutorial for
instructions on safely removing a shard from a cluster.

.. _chunk-migration-procedure:

Chunk Migration Procedure
-------------------------

All chunk migrations use the following procedure:

#. The balancer process sends the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command to
   the source shard.

#. The source starts the move with an internal :dbcommand:`moveChunk`
   command. During the migration process, operations to the chunk
   route to the source shard. The source shard is responsible for
   incoming write operations for the chunk.

#. The destination shard builds any indexes required by the source
   that do not exist on the destination.

#. The destination shard begins requesting documents in the chunk and
   starts receiving copies of the data. See also
   :ref:`chunk-migration-replication`.

#. After receiving the final document in the chunk, the
   destination shard starts a synchronization process to ensure that it
   has the changes to the migrated documents that occurred during the
   migration.

#. When fully synchronized, the source shard connects to the
   :term:`config database` and updates the cluster metadata with the new
   location for the chunk.

#. After the source shard completes the update of the metadata,
   and once there are no open cursors on the chunk, the source shard
   deletes its copy of the documents.

   .. note::

      If the balancer needs to perform additional chunk migrations from
      the source shard, the balancer can start the next chunk migration
      without waiting for the current migration process to finish this
      deletion step. See :ref:`chunk-migration-queuing`.

   .. seealso::
   
      :ref:`moveChunk-directory`

The migration process ensures consistency and maximizes the availability of
chunks during balancing.

.. _sharding-migration-thresholds:

Migration Thresholds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To minimize the impact of balancing on the cluster, the :term:`balancer`
begins balancing only after the distribution of data for a sharded
collection has reached the migration threshold that makes the cluster
unbalanced. When the number of chunks on the most loaded shard exceeds
the optimal number of chunks per shard by more than 1 chunk, the
collection is unbalanced and the :term:`balancer` initiates chunk
migrations. The optimal number of chunks per shard is the total number
of chunks in a sharded collection divided by the number of shards,
rounded up to the nearest integer. If :term:`zones <zone>` exist,
MongoDB calculates the optimal number of chunks on a per-zone basis. 

For example, if a user adds a new shard to a collection of 10 shards
with 20 chunks each, the :term:`balancer` does not migrate any data. The
optimal number of chunks on each shard is 200 divided by 11, or 18.18,
which MongoDB rounds up to 19. Because the difference between 19 and 20
is 1, the cluster is balanced and the :term:`balancer` does not migrate
any chunks to the new shard.

.. seealso::

   :method:`sh.balancerCollectionStatus()`


.. _chunk-migration-queuing:
.. _asynchronous-chunk-migration-cleanup:

Asynchronous Chunk Migration Cleanup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To migrate multiple chunks from a shard, the balancer migrates the
chunks one at a time. However, the balancer does not wait for the
current migration's delete phase to complete before starting the next
chunk migration. See :ref:`sharding-chunk-migration` for the chunk
migration process and the delete phase.

This queuing behavior allows shards to unload chunks more quickly in
cases of heavily imbalanced cluster, such as when performing initial
data loads without pre-splitting and when adding new shards.

This behavior also affects the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command, and
migration scripts that use the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command may
proceed more quickly.

In some cases, the delete phases may persist longer. Starting in MongoDB
4.4, chunk migrations are enhanced to be more resilient in the event of
a failover during the delete phase. Orphaned documents are cleaned up
even if a replica set's primary crashes or restarts during this phase.

The ``_waitForDelete``, available as a setting for the balancer as well
as the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command, can alter the behavior so that
the delete phase of the current migration blocks the start of the next
chunk migration. The ``_waitForDelete`` is generally for internal
testing purposes. For more information, see
:ref:`wait-for-delete-setting`.

.. _chunk-migration-replication:

Chunk Migration and Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.4

During chunk migration, the ``_secondaryThrottle`` value determines
when the migration proceeds with next document in the chunk.

In the :data:`config.settings` collection:

- If the ``_secondaryThrottle`` setting for the balancer is set to a
  write concern, each document move during chunk migration must receive
  the requested acknowledgement before proceeding with the next
  document.

- If the ``_secondaryThrottle`` setting for the balancer is set to
  ``true``, each document move during chunk migration must receive
  acknowledgement from at least one secondary before the migration
  proceeds with the next document in the chunk. This is equivalent to a
  write concern of :writeconcern:`{ w: 2 } <\<number\>>`.

- If the ``_secondaryThrottle`` setting is unset, the migration process
  does not wait for replication to a secondary and instead continues
  with the next document.


To update the ``_secondaryThrottle`` parameter for the balancer, see
:ref:`sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle` for an example.

Independent of any ``_secondaryThrottle`` setting, certain phases of
the chunk migration have the following replication policy:

- MongoDB briefly pauses all application reads and writes to the
  collection being migrated, on the source shard, before updating the
  config servers with the new location for the chunk, and resumes the
  application reads and writes after the update. The chunk move requires
  all writes to be acknowledged by majority of the members of the
  replica set both before and after committing the chunk move to config
  servers.
 
- When an outgoing chunk migration finishes and cleanup occurs, all
  writes must be replicated to a majority of servers before further
  cleanup (from other outgoing migrations) or new incoming migrations
  can proceed.

To update the ``_secondaryThrottle`` setting in the
:data:`config.settings` collection, see
:ref:`sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle` for an example.

.. _migration-chunk-size-limit:

Maximum Number of Documents Per Chunk to Migrate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/limits-sharding-maximum-documents-chunk.rst

.. _range-deletion-performance-tuning:

Range Deletion Performance Tuning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can tune the performance impact of range deletions
with :parameter:`rangeDeleterBatchSize` and
:parameter:`rangeDeleterBatchDelayMS` parameters. For example:

- To limit the number of documents deleted per batch, you can set
  :parameter:`rangeDeleterBatchSize` to a small value such as ``32``.

- To add an additional delay between batch deletions, you can set
  :parameter:`rangeDeleterBatchDelayMS` above the current default of
  ``20`` milliseconds.

.. note::

   If there are ongoing read operations or open cursors on the
   collection targeted for deletes, range deletion processes may
   not proceed.

.. _sharding-shard-size:

Shard Size
----------

By default, MongoDB attempts to fill all available disk space with
data on every shard as the data set grows. To ensure that the cluster
always has the capacity to handle data growth, monitor disk
usage as well as other performance metrics.

See the :ref:`sharded-cluster-config-max-shard-size` tutorial for
instructions on setting the maximum size for a shard.
