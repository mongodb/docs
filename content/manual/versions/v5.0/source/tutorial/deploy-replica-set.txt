Requirements
------------

For production deployments, you should maintain as much separation between
members as possible by hosting the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances on separate machines. When using virtual machines for
production deployments, you should place each :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance on a separate host server serviced by redundant power circuits
and redundant network paths.

Before you can deploy a replica set, you must install MongoDB on
each system that will be part of your :term:`replica set`.
If you have not already installed MongoDB, see the :ref:`installation tutorials <tutorial-installation>`.

Deploy a Replica Set in the Terminal
------------------------------------

This tutorial describes how to create a three-member 
:term:`replica set` from three existing :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances
running with :ref:`access control <authorization>` disabled.

To deploy a replica set with enabled :ref:`access control <authorization>`, see
:ref:`deploy-repl-set-with-auth`. If you wish to deploy a
replica set from a single MongoDB instance, see
:ref:`server-replica-set-deploy-convert`. For more
information on replica set deployments, see the :ref:`replication` and
:ref:`replica-set-architecture` documentation.
