|compass| provides the ability to import and export data to and
from your :doc:`collections </collections>`. Compass supports import
and export for both **JSON** and **CSV** files. To import or export
data to or from a collection, navigate to the detailed collection view
by either selecting the collection from the
:doc:`Databases </databases>` tab or clicking the collection in the
left-side navigation.

Import Data into a Collection
-----------------------------

|compass| can import data into a collection from either a **JSON** or
**CSV** file.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/readonly-not-permitted-import.rst

- Importing data is not available if you are connected to a
  :atlas:`Data Lake </data-lake>`.

Format Your Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can import your data into |compass| you must first ensure
that it is formatted correctly.

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: json
       name: JSON
       content: |

         When importing data from a **JSON** file, you can format your 
         data as:

         - Newline-delimited documents, or

         - Comma-separated documents in an array

         .. example::

            The following newline-delimited ``.json`` file is formatted 
            correctly:

            .. code-block:: javascript

               { "type": "home", "number": "212-555-1234" }
               { "type": "cell", "number": "646-555-4567" }
               { "type": "office", "number": "202-555-0182"}

            The following comma-separated ``.json`` array file is also 
            formatted correctly:

            .. code-block:: javascript

               [{ "type": "home", "number": "212-555-1234" }, { "type": "cell", "number": "646-555-4567" }, { "type": "office", "number": "202-555-0182"}]

            |compass-short| ignores line breaks in JSON arrays.

            |compass-short| automatically generates :manual:`ObjectIDs
            </reference/method/ObjectId/>` for these objects on import
            since no ObjectIDs were specified in the initial JSON.

     - id: csv
       name: CSV
       content: |

         When importing data from a **CSV** file, the first line of the 
         file must be a comma-separated list of your document field 
         names. Subsequent lines in the file must be comma-separated 
         field values in the order corresponding with the field order 
         in the first line.

         .. example::

            The following ``.csv`` file imports three documents:

            .. code-block:: none

               name,age,fav_color,pet
               Jeff,25,green,Bongo
               Alice,20,purple,Hazel
               Tim,32,red,Lassie

            |compass| automatically generates :manual:`ObjectIDs
            </reference/method/ObjectId/>` for these objects on import
            since no ObjectIDs were specified in the initial CSV file.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To import your formatted data into a collection:

.. include:: /includes/steps/import.rst

A progress bar displays the status of the import. If an error occurs
during import, the progress bar turns red and an error message
appears in the dialog. After successful import, the dialog closes and
Compass displays the collection page containing the newly imported
documents.

Export Data from a Collection
-----------------------------

|compass| can export data from a collection as either a
**JSON** or **CSV** file. If you specify a
:ref:`filter <query-bar-filter>`, |compass-short| only exports 
documents which match the specified query.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

While it is possible to exclude documents by using a query filter,
it is not possible to re-shape exported documents with a
:ref:`project <query-bar-project>` document. Even when you specify a
``project`` option in the query, |compass-short| still exports the
entire document.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Export Entire Collection
      :tabid: export-entire-collection

      To export an entire collection to a file:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/export.rst

      .. include:: /includes/fact-export-progress-bar.rst

   .. tab:: Export Filtered Subset of a Collection
      :tabid: export-filter

      To export a subset of documents from a collection:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/export-filter.rst

      .. include:: /includes/fact-export-progress-bar.rst

Import and Export Data from the Command Line
--------------------------------------------

To import and export data from the command line, you can use MongoDB's
:db-tools:`Database Tools </>`. See
:db-tools:`mongoimport </mongoimport>` and
:db-tools:`mongoexport </mongoexport>`.
