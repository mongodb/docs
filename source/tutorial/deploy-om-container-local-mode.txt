In a default configuration, the {+mdbagent+}\s and Backup Daemons
access MongoDB installation archives over the Internet from |company|

You can configure |onprem| to run in **Local Mode** with the 
|k8s-op-short| if the nodes in your |k8s| cluster don't have access to
the Internet. The Backup Daemons and managed MongoDB resources download
installation archives only from a |k8s-pv| that you create for
the |onprem| StatefulSet.

This procedure covers uploading installation archives to |onprem|.

Considerations
--------------

When you upgrade the version of an |onprem| resource in Local
Mode, you must also upgrade to the latest version of the :dl:`MongoDB
Database Tools <database-tools>`. ``automation.versions.directory``
specifies the location of the Database Tools, which defaults to
``/mongodb-ops-manager/mongodb-releases/``.

Prerequisites
-------------

:ref:`deploy-om-container`. The following procedure shows you how to 
update your |onprem| |k8s| |k8s-obj| to enable Local Mode.
