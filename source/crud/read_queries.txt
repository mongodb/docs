Overview
--------

In the previous guide, :ref:`guide-read-noquery`, you retrieved all documents
from the ``sample_guides.planets`` collection without specifying any
criteria that the documents should meet.

In this guide, you will query the collection and retrieve documents that
match specific **equality** criteria, meaning the values of the specified
field or fields must match.

What You'll Need
----------------

.. include:: /includes/prereqs_read_CRUD.rst

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-selector:: drivers

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Connect to your MongoDB instance.


      .. tip::

         In this code block there is a comment to replace the connection URI
         with your own. Replace the URI string with your own
         :ref:`Atlas connection string <guides-get-connection-string>`.

      .. include:: /includes/drivers_connect.rst


   .. step:: Get the database and collection.

      Switch to the database and collection you want to query. In this case
      you will use the ``{+guides-db+}`` database and ``{+guides-coll+}``
      collection.

      .. include:: /includes/bind_db.rst

   .. step::  Retrieve specific documents in the ``{+guides-coll+}`` collection.

      You can retrieve specific documents from a collection by applying a query filter.
      A query filter is a document that contains the criteria you are searching for.
      The following example illustrates using a query filter to retrieve documents
      from the ``{+guides-coll+}`` collection that have a ``hasRings`` field
      with a value of ``true``.

      .. include:: /includes/find_with_query.rst

   .. step:: Iterate over the results.

      .. include:: /includes/iterate_all_noshellcursor.rst

   .. step::  Check your results.

      Here is the complete code followed by sample output.

      .. include:: /includes/crud_read_find_final_query.rst

   .. step:: Query using multiple criteria.

       You can also query the collection using multiple criteria.
       The following example illustrates using multiple criteria to retrieve
       documents from the ``{+guides-coll+}`` collection that have a
       ``hasRings`` field with a value of ``false`` and ``Argon(Ar)`` as an
       entry in the  ``mainAtmosphere`` field.

       .. include:: /includes/crud_find_multiple_query.rst

       Even though the ``mainAtmosphere`` field is an array, you can use
       a strict equality query because MongoDB treats arrays as first-class
       types. During execution of the query, MongoDB compared each entry
       in the array to the value you specified, in this case ``"Ar"``,
       to determine if the documents matched your criteria.


Summary
-------

If you have completed this guide, you have retrieved data from MongoDB
using specific equality criteria. This is useful when you know exactly
what you're searching for, for example an item number, a username, or
chemical element.

What's Next
-----------

In the next guide, you'll learn how to read data from MongoDB using comparison
operators to retrieve documents that match a broader set of criteria.
