.. warning::

   |service| does not support Network Peering between clusters 
   deployed in a single region on different cloud providers.
   For example, you cannot set up Network Peering between 
   an |service| cluster hosted in a single region on AWS and an 
   application hosted in a single region on GCP.

.. important::

   To set up a Network Peering connection, you must have either the
   :authrole:`Project Owner` or :authrole:`Organization Owner` role.

Configure an |service| Network Peering Connection
-------------------------------------------------

To configure |service| Network Peering for a cluster, perform the
procedure on the tab corresponding to your cluster's cloud provider.
You also configure the |service| |vpc| |cidr| during this procedure.

To configure the |service| |cidr| without configuring Network Peering,
see :oas-atlas-op:`Create a New Network Peering Container </createOneNewNetworkPeeringContainer>`.
You must use the |api| to configure the |service| |cidr| without
Network Peering.

      Considerations
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      DNS Configuration
      `````````````````

      |dns| resolves the cluster's hostnames to their public |ipaddr|
      address rather than their internal |ipaddr| address if:

      - :guilabel:`DNS hostnames` are disabled,
      - :guilabel:`DNS resolution` is disabled, and
      - The user accesses the |service| cluster from outside a peered
        :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>`.

      To learn more about how to enable these options, see
      :aws:`Updating DNS Support for Your VPC </AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-updating>`.

      If the applications deployed within |aws| use custom |dns|
      services and :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>` peering with |service|,
      see :ref:`the FAQ <atlas-faq-custom-dns>` to learn how to
      connect using private connection strings.

      Deployments in Multiple Regions
      ```````````````````````````````

      |service| deployments in multiple regions must have a peering
      connection for each |service| region.

      For example: If you have a |vpc| in Sydney and |service|
      deployments in Sydney and Singapore, create two peering
      connections.

      AWS VPC Peering Prerequisites
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. include:: /includes/fact-aws-vpc-prereqs.rst

      Configure Network Peering for an AWS-backed Cluster
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To configure |service| |vpc| Peering for an |aws|\-backed
      cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/vpc-aws.rst

      Before your new |vpc| peer can connect to your |service| cluster, 
      you must:

      - Locate the |vpc| |cidr| block addresses (or subset), or the
        Security Groups, associated with the |vpc| configured
        in your project.
      - Add at least one of these |cidr| blocks to the
        :ref:`access list <access-list>`.

      .. seealso::

      Configure VPC Peering for a GCP-backed Cluster
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To configure |service| |vpc| Peering for a |gcp|\-backed
      cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/vpc-gcp.rst

      You must add your |vpc| |cidr| block address (or subset)
      associated with the peer |vpc| to the
      :ref:`IP access list <access-list>` before your new |vpc| peer 
      can connect to your |service| cluster. When connecting to your 
      cluster, you must use the new :ref:`private connection strings 
      <atlas-faq-connstring-private>` to utilize the peering.

      .. seealso::

         :gcp:`Auto mode IP ranges </vpc/docs/vpc#ip-ranges>`.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: azure

      .. note::

         Effective March 31, 2020, |service| has removed the
         **Peering-Only Mode** limitations for all existing and new
         Azure clusters. To learn how to use these new features, see
         the :ref:`FAQ on changes to Azure network peering 
         <atlas-faq-azure-gcp-peering-only>`

      Azure Roles Required to Configure a Network Peering Connection
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To learn the |azure| roles that you need to create a Network
      Peering connection, see the :azure:`Azure documentation
      </virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-peering#permissions>`.

      Configure Network Peering for an Azure-backed Cluster
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To configure Network Peering for an |azure|-backed cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/network-peering-azure.rst

      You must add the |cidr| block address (or subset)
      associated with the peer VNet to the
      :ref:`whitelist <access-list>` before your network peer
      can connect to your |service| cluster. When connecting to your 
      cluster, you must use the new :ref:`private connection string 
      <atlas-faq-connstring-private>` to utilize the peering.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      To view your network peering connections using the {+atlas-ui+}:

      1. If it is not already displayed, select the organization that
         contains your desired project from the |ui-org-menu| in the
         navigation bar.

      #. If it is not already displayed, select your desired project
         from the :guilabel:`Projects` menu in the navigation bar.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Network Access` in the sidebar.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Peering` tab. |service| displays your
         network peering connections.

Network Peering Architectures
------------------------------

Multiple cloud-hosted applications might need to connect securely to the
same |service| project.

Network Peering between an |service| VPC and Two Virtual Networks with Identical CIDR Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider a case where two applications use virtual networks (VPC, VNet)
with identical IP |cidr| blocks. You want both applications to securely
connect to the same |service| cluster via VPC peering. To achieve this,
create one network peering connection between each application's
virtual network and your |service| cluster.

Cloud provider virtual networks canâ€™t peer to each other if they have
identical CIDR blocks. However, you can peer each of the applications'
virtual networks with the |service| virtual network if the |service|
virtual network includes two non-overlapping |cidr| blocks. Configure
each of the peering connections to have non-overlapping route-back
|cidr| blocks in the |service| virtual network.

Follow this general process:

1. Before you deploy any clusters, :ref:`create a network peering 
   connection <create-network-peer-connection>`
   for each virtual network that you want to peer with |service|. You
   do this by creating a |cidr| block in the |service| virtual network
   for each application's virtual network. 

#. In the virtual network's configuration for your cloud provider, 
   establish routing between each of your application's virtual networks
   and their respective |service| CIDR blocks. 

#. Deploy your |service| cluster.
