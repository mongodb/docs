.. dbcommand:: replSetMaintenance

   The :dbcommand:`replSetMaintenance` admin command enables or disables the
   maintenance mode for a :term:`secondary` member of a :term:`replica
   set`.

   The command has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetMaintenance: <boolean> }

Behavior
--------

Consider the following behavior when running the
:dbcommand:`replSetMaintenance` command:

- You cannot run the command on the Primary.

- You must run the command against the ``admin`` database.

- When enabled ``replSetMaintenance: true``, the member enters the
  ``RECOVERING`` state. While the secondary is ``RECOVERING``:

  - The member is not accessible for read operations.

  - The member continues to sync its :term:`oplog` from the Primary.

- When a node receives a ``replSetMaintenance: true`` request, it
  adds a maintenance mode task to a queue of tasks. If the queue of
  tasks was empty and now is not, the node will transition to
  ``RECOVERING`` state and begin to reject read requests. When a node
  receives a ``replSetMaintenance: false`` request, it removes a
  maintenance mode task from the queue (even if that task was
  initiated by a different client). If the request empties 
  the maintenance mode task queue, the node will return to 
  ``SECONDARY`` state.
    
- If you want to prevent a node from servicing reads, consider using
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-hidden-member` instead.
