This document introduces lower level sharding concepts for users who are
familiar with :term:`sharding` generally and want to learn more about
the internals. This document provides a more detailed understanding of
your cluster's behavior. For higher level sharding concepts, see
:doc:`/core/sharded-clusters`. For complete documentation of sharded clusters see the
:doc:`/sharding` section of this manual.

.. index:: shard key; internals

Shard Keys
----------

Shard keys are the field in a collection that MongoDB uses to
distribute :term:`documents <document>` within a sharded cluster. See the
:ref:`overview of shard keys <sharding-shard-key>` for an
introduction to these topics.

.. index:: shard key; cardinality
.. _sharding-shard-key-cardinality:

Cardinality
~~~~~~~~~~~

Cardinality in the context of MongoDB, refers to the ability of the
system to :term:`partition` data into :term:`chunks <chunk>`. For
example, consider a collection of data such as an "address book" that
stores address records:

- Consider the use of a ``state`` field as a shard key:

  The state key's value holds the US state for a given address document.
  This field has a *low cardinality* as all documents that have the
  same value in the ``state`` field *must* reside on the same shard,
  even if a particular state's chunk exceeds the maximum chunk size.

  Since there are a limited number of possible values for the ``state``
  field, MongoDB may distribute data unevenly among a small
  number of fixed chunks. This may have a number of effects:

  - If MongoDB cannot split a chunk because all of its documents
    have the same shard key, migrations involving these un-splittable
    chunks will take longer than other migrations, and it will be more
    difficult for your data to stay balanced.

  - If you have a fixed maximum number of chunks, you will never be
    able to use more than that number of shards for this collection.

- Consider the use of a ``zipcode`` field as a shard key:

  While this field has a large number of possible values, and thus has
  potentially higher cardinality, it's possible that a large number of users
  could have the same value for the shard key, which would make this
  chunk of users un-splittable.

  In these cases, cardinality depends on the data. If your address book
  stores records for a geographically distributed contact list
  (e.g. "Dry cleaning businesses in America,") then a value like
  zipcode would be sufficient. However, if your address book is
  more geographically concentrated (e.g "ice cream stores in Boston
  Massachusetts,") then you may have a much lower cardinality.

- Consider the use of a ``phone-number`` field as a shard key:

  Phone number has a *high cardinality,* because users will generally
  have a unique value for this field, MongoDB will be able to split as
  many chunks as needed.

While "high cardinality," is necessary for ensuring an even
distribution of data, having a high cardinality does not guarantee
sufficient :ref:`query isolation <sharding-shard-key-query-isolation>`
or appropriate :ref:`write scaling <sharding-shard-key-write-scaling>`.
Please continue reading for more information on these topics.

.. index:: shard key; write scaling
.. _sharding-shard-key-write-scaling:

Write Scaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some possible shard keys will allow your application to take advantage of
the increased write capacity that the cluster can provide, while
others do not. Consider the following example where you shard by the
values of the default :term:`_id` field, which is :term:`ObjectId`.

``ObjectId`` is computed upon document creation, that is a
unique identifier for the object. However, the most significant bits of data
in this value represent a time stamp, which means that they increment
in a regular and predictable pattern. Even though this value has
:ref:`high cardinality <sharding-shard-key-cardinality>`, when using
this, *any date, or other monotonically increasing number* as the shard
key, all insert operations will be storing data into a single chunk, and
therefore, a single shard. As a result, the write capacity of this shard
will define the effective write capacity of the cluster.

A shard key that increases monotonically will not hinder performance
if you have a very low insert rate, or if most of your write
operations are :method:`update() <db.collection.update()>` operations
distributed through your entire data set. Generally, choose shard keys
that have *both* high cardinality and will distribute write operations
across the *entire cluster*.

Typically, a computed shard key that has some amount of "randomness,"
such as ones that include a cryptographic hash (i.e. MD5 or SHA1) of
other content in the document, will allow the cluster to scale write
operations. However, random shard keys do not typically provide
:ref:`query isolation <sharding-shard-key-query-isolation>`, which is
another important characteristic of shard keys.

.. _sharding-internals-querying:

Querying
~~~~~~~~

The :binary:`~bin.mongos` provides an interface for applications to
interact with sharded clusters that hides the complexity of :term:`data
partitioning <partition>`. A :binary:`~bin.mongos` receives queries from
applications, and uses metadata from the :ref:`config server
<sharding-config-server>`, to route queries to the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances with the appropriate data. While the :binary:`~bin.mongos`
succeeds in making all querying operational in sharded environments,
the :term:`shard key` you select can have a profound affect on query
performance.

.. seealso:: The :ref:`mongos and Sharding <sharding-mongos>` and
   :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>` sections for a more
   general overview of querying in sharded environments.

.. index:: shard key; query isolation
.. _sharding-shard-key-query-isolation:

Query Isolation
```````````````

The fastest queries in a sharded environment are those that
:binary:`~bin.mongos` will route to a single shard, using the
:term:`shard key` and the cluster meta data from the :ref:`config server
<sharding-config-server>`. For queries that don't include the shard
key, :binary:`~bin.mongos` must query all shards, wait for their response
and then return the result to the application. These "scatter/gather"
queries can be long running operations.

If your query includes the first component of a compound shard
key [#shard-key-index]_, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` can route the
query directly to a single shard, or a small number of shards, which
provides better performance. Even if you query values of the shard
key reside in different chunks, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` will route
queries directly to specific shards.

To select a shard key for a collection:

- determine the most commonly included fields in queries for a
  given application

- find which of these operations are most performance dependent.

.. todo:: - link to document produced by DOCS-235

If this field has low cardinality (i.e not sufficiently
selective) you should add a second field to the shard key making a
compound shard key. The data may become more splittable with a
compound shard key.

.. see:: :ref:`sharding-mongos` for more information on query
   operations in the context of sharded clusters. Specifically the
   :ref:`sharding-query-routing` sub-section outlines the procedure
   that :binary:`~bin.mongos` uses to route read operations to the shards.

.. [#shard-key-index] In many ways, you can think of the shard key a
   cluster-wide unique index. However, be aware that sharded systems
   cannot enforce cluster-wide unique indexes *unless* the unique
   field is in the shard key. Consider the :doc:`/core/indexes` page
   for more information on indexes and compound indexes.

Sorting
```````

In sharded systems, the :binary:`~bin.mongos` performs a merge-sort of all
sorted query results from the shards. See the :ref:`sharded query
routing <sharding-query-routing>` and :ref:`index-sort` sections for
more information.

.. _sharding-internals-operations-and-reliability:

Operations and Reliability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most important consideration when choosing a :term:`shard key`
are:

- to ensure that MongoDB will be able to distribute data evenly among
  shards, and

- to scale writes across the cluster, and

- to ensure that :binary:`~bin.mongos` can isolate most queries to a specific
  :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

Furthermore:

- Each shard should be a :term:`replica set`, if a specific
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance fails, the replica set members will elect
  another to be :term:`primary` and continue operation. However, if an
  entire shard is unreachable or fails for some reason, that data will
  be unavailable.

- If the shard key allows the :binary:`~bin.mongos` to isolate most
  operations to a single shard, then the failure of a single shard
  will only render *some* data unavailable.

- If your shard key distributes data required for every operation
  throughout the cluster, then the failure of the entire shard will
  render the entire cluster unavailable.

In essence, this concern for reliability simply underscores the
importance of choosing a shard key that isolates query operations to a
single shard.

.. _sharding-internals-choose-shard-key:

Choosing a Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is unlikely that any single, naturally occurring key in your
collection will satisfy all requirements of a good shard key. There
are three options:

#. Compute a more ideal shard key in your application layer,
   and store this in all of your documents, potentially in the
   ``_id`` field.

#. Use a compound shard key, that uses two or three values from all
   documents that provide the right mix of cardinality with scalable
   write operations and query isolation.

#. Determine that the impact of using a less than ideal shard key,
   is insignificant in your use case given:

   - limited write volume,
   - expected data size, or
   - query patterns and demands.

From a decision making stand point, begin by finding the field
that will provide the required :ref:`query isolation
<sharding-shard-key-query-isolation>`, ensure that :ref:`writes will
scale across the cluster <sharding-shard-key-query-isolation>`, and
then add an additional field to provide additional :ref:`cardinality
<sharding-shard-key-cardinality>` if your primary key does not have
sufficient split-ability.

.. index:: sharding; shard key indexes
.. _sharding-internals-shard-key-indexes:
.. _sharding-shard-key-indexes:

Shard Key Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All sharded collections **must** have an index that starts with the
:term:`shard key`. If you shard a collection that does not yet contain
documents and *without* such an index, the :dbcommand:`shardCollection`
command will create an index on the shard key. If the collection already
contains documents, you must create an appropriate index before using
:dbcommand:`shardCollection`.

.. todo:: replace the link

.. versionchanged:: 2.2
   The index on the shard key no longer needs to be identical to the
   shard key. This index can be an index of the shard key itself as before,
   or a :term:`compound index` where the
   shard key is the prefix of the index. This index *cannot* be a
   multikey index.

If you have a collection named ``people``, sharded using the field ``{ zipcode: 1 }``,
and you want to replace this with an index on the field ``{ zipcode:
1, username: 1 }``, then:

#. Create an index on ``{ zipcode: 1, username: 1 }``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.people.ensureIndex( { zipcode: 1, username: 1 } );

#. When MongoDB finishes building the index, you can safely drop
   existing index on ``{ zipcode: 1 }``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.people.dropIndex( { zipcode: 1 } );

.. warning::

   The index on the shard key **cannot** be a multikey index.

   As above, an index on ``{ zipcode: 1, username: 1 }`` can only
   replace an index on ``zipcode`` if there are no array values for
   the ``username`` field.

   If you drop the last appropriate index for the shard key, recover
   by recreating an index on just the shard key.

.. index:: balancing; internals
.. _sharding-balancing-internals:

Cluster Balancer
----------------

The :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` sub-process is responsible
for redistributing chunks evenly among the shards and ensuring that
each member of the cluster is responsible for the same volume of
data. This section contains complete documentation of the balancer
process and operations. For a higher level introduction see the
:ref:`sharding-balancing` section.

.. _sharding-internals-balancing:

Balancing Internals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A balancing round originates from an arbitrary :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instance from one of the cluster's
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. When a balancer process is active, the
responsible :binary:`~bin.mongos` acquires a "lock" by modifying a
document in the ``lock`` collection in the :ref:`config-database`.

By default, the balancer process is always running. When the number of
chunks in a collection is unevenly distributed among the shards, the
balancer begins migrating :term:`chunks <chunk>` from shards with more
chunks to shards with a fewer number of chunks. The balancer will
continue migrating chunks, one at a time, until the data is evenly
distributed among the shards.

While these automatic chunk migrations are crucial for distributing
data, they carry some overhead in terms of bandwidth and workload,
both of which can impact database performance. As a result, MongoDB
attempts to minimize the effect of balancing by only migrating chunks
when the distribution of chunks passes the :ref:`migration thresholds
<sharding-migration-thresholds>`.

.. index:: balancing; migration

The migration process ensures consistency and maximizes availability
of chunks during balancing: when MongoDB begins migrating a chunk, the
database begins copying the data to the new server and tracks incoming
write operations. After migrating chunks, the "from" :binary:`~bin.mongod`
sends all new writes to the "receiving" server. Finally,
:binary:`~bin.mongos` updates the chunk record in the :term:`config
database` to reflect the new location of the chunk.

.. note::

   .. versionchanged:: 2.0
      Before MongoDB version 2.0, large differences in timekeeping
      (i.e. clock skew) between :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances could lead
      to failed distributed locks, which carries the possibility of
      data loss, particularly with skews larger than 5 minutes.
      Always use the network time protocol (NTP) by running ``ntpd``
      on your servers to minimize clock skew.

.. _sharding-migration-thresholds:

Migration Thresholds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 2.2
   The following thresholds appear first in 2.2; prior to this
   release, balancing would only commence if the shard with the most
   chunks had 8 more chunks than the shard with the least number of
   chunks.

In order to minimize the impact of balancing on the cluster, the
:term:`balancer` will not begin balancing until the distribution of
chunks has reached certain thresholds. These thresholds apply to the
difference in number of :term:`chunks <chunk>` between the shard with
the greatest number of chunks and the shard with the least number of
chunks. The balancer has the following thresholds:

================  ===================
Number of Chunks  Migration Threshold
----------------  -------------------
Less than 20       2
20-79              4
80 and greater     8
================  ===================

Once a balancing round starts, the balancer will not stop until the
difference between the number of chunks on any two shards is *less
than two* or a chunk migration fails.

.. note::

   You can restrict the balancer so that it only operates between specific
   start and end times. See :ref:`Schedule the Balancing Window
   <sharding-schedule-balancing-window>` for more information.

   The specification of the balancing window is relative to the local
   time zone of all individual :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances in the
   sharded cluster.

.. index:: sharding; chunk size
.. _sharding-chunk-size:

Chunk Size
~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo:: link this section to <glossary:chunk size>

The default :term:`chunk` size in MongoDB is 64 megabytes.

When chunks grow beyond the :ref:`specified chunk size
<sharding-chunk-size>` a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance will split the
chunk in half. This will eventually lead to migrations, when chunks
become unevenly distributed among the cluster. The :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances will initiate a round of migrations to redistribute data in
the cluster.

Chunk size is arbitrary and must account for the following:

#. Small chunks lead to a more even distribution of data at the
   expense of more frequent migrations, which creates expense at the
   query routing (:binary:`~bin.mongos`) layer.

#. Large chunks lead to fewer migrations, which is more efficient both
   from the networking perspective *and* in terms internal overhead at
   the query routing layer. Large chunks produce these efficiencies at
   the expense of a potentially more uneven distribution of data.

For many deployments it makes sense to avoid frequent and potentially
spurious migrations at the expense of a slightly less evenly
distributed data set, but this value is :ref:`configurable
<sharding-balancing-modify-chunk-size>`. Be aware of the following limitations
when modifying chunk size:

- Automatic splitting only occurs when inserting :term:`documents
  <document>` or updating existing documents; if you lower the chunk
  size it may take time for all chunks to split to the new size.

- Splits cannot be "undone:" if you increase the chunk size, existing
  chunks must grow through insertion or updates until they reach the
  new size.

.. note::

   Chunk ranges are inclusive of the lower boundary and exclusive of
   the upper boundary.

.. _sharding-shard-size:

Shard Size
~~~~~~~~~~

By default, MongoDB will attempt to fill all available disk space with
data on every shard as the data set grows. Monitor disk utilization in
addition to other performance metrics, to ensure that the cluster
always has capacity to accommodate additional data.

You can also configure a "maximum size" for any shard when you add the
shard using the ``maxSize`` parameter of the :dbcommand:`addShard`
command. This will prevent the :term:`balancer` from migrating chunks
to the shard when the value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped`
exceeds the ``maxSize`` setting.

.. seealso:: :ref:`sharded-cluster-config-max-shard-size` and
   :doc:`/administration/monitoring`.

.. _sharding-chunk-migration:

Chunk Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB migrates chunks in a :term:`sharded cluster` to distribute data
evenly among shards. Migrations may be either:

- Manual. In these migrations you must specify the chunk that you want
  to migrate and the destination shard. Only migrate chunks manually
  after initiating sharding, to distribute data during bulk inserts,
  or if the cluster becomes uneven. See :ref:`Migrating Chunks
  <sharding-balancing-manual-migration>` for more details.

- Automatic. The balancer process handles most migrations when
  distribution of chunks between shards becomes uneven. See
  :ref:`Migration Thresholds <sharding-migration-thresholds>` for more
  details.

All chunk migrations use the following procedure:

#. The balancer process sends the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command to
   the source shard for the chunk. In this operation the balancer
   passes the name of the destination shard to the source shard.

#. The source initiates the move with an internal
   :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command with the destination shard.

#. The destination shard begins requesting documents in the chunk, and
   begins receiving these chunks.

#. After receiving the final document in the chunk, the destination
   shard initiates a synchronization process to ensure that all
   changes to the documents in the chunk on the source shard during
   the migration process exist on the destination shard.

   When fully synchronized, the destination shard connects to the
   :term:`config database` and updates the chunk location in the
   cluster metadata. After completing this operation, once there are
   no open cursors on the chunk, the source shard starts deleting
   its copy of documents from the migrated chunk.

If enabled, the ``_secondaryThrottle`` setting causes the balancer to
wait for replication to secondaries. For more information, see
:ref:`sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle`.

Detect Connections to :binary:`~bin.mongos` Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application must detect if the MongoDB instance its connected
to is :binary:`~bin.mongos`, use the :dbcommand:`isMaster` command. When a
client connects to a :binary:`~bin.mongos`, :dbcommand:`isMaster` returns
a document with a ``msg`` field that holds the string
``isdbgrid``. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "ismaster" : true,
      "msg" : "isdbgrid",
      "maxBsonObjectSize" : 16777216,
      "ok" : 1
   }

If the application is instead connected to a :binary:`~bin.mongod`, the
returned document does not include the ``isdbgrid`` string.

.. index:: config database
.. index:: database, config
.. _sharding-internals-config-database:

Config Database
---------------

The ``config`` database contains information about your sharding
configuration and stores the information in a set of collections
used by sharding.

.. important:: Back up the ``config`` database before performing
   any maintenance on the config server.

To access the ``config`` database, issue the following command from the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use config

In general, you should *never* manipulate the content of the config
database directly. The ``config`` database contains the following
collections:

- :data:`~config.changelog`
- :data:`~config.chunks`
- :data:`~config.collections`
- :data:`~config.databases`
- :data:`~config.lockpings`
- :data:`~config.locks`
- :data:`~config.mongos`
- :data:`~config.settings`
- :data:`~config.shards`
- :data:`~config.version`

See :doc:`/reference/config-database` for full documentation of these
collections and their role in sharded clusters.

Sharding GridFS Stores
----------------------

When sharding a :term:`GridFS` store, consider the following:

- Most deployments will not need to shard the ``files``
  collection. The ``files`` collection is typically small, and only
  contains metadata. None of the required keys for GridFS lend
  themselves to an even distribution in a sharded situation. If you
  *must* shard the ``files`` collection, use the ``_id`` field
  possibly in combination with an application field

  Leaving ``files`` unsharded means that all the file metadata
  documents live on one shard. For production GridFS stores you *must*
  store the ``files`` collection on a replica set.

- To shard the ``chunks`` collection by ``{ files_id : 1 , n : 1 }``,
  issue commands similar to the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.fs.chunks.ensureIndex( { files_id : 1 , n : 1 } )

     db.runCommand( { shardCollection : "test.fs.chunks" , key : { files_id : 1 , n : 1 } } )

  You may also want shard using just the ``file_id`` field, as in the
  following operation:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { shardCollection : "test.fs.chunks" , key : {  files_id : 1 } } )

  .. note::

     .. versionchanged:: 2.2

     Before 2.2, you had to create an additional index on ``files_id``
     to shard using *only* this field.

  The default ``files_id`` value is an :term:`ObjectId`, as a result
  the values of ``files_id`` are always ascending, and applications
  will insert all new GridFS data to a single chunk and shard.  If
  your write load is too high for a single server to handle, consider
  a different shard key or use a different value for different value
  for ``_id`` in the ``files`` collection.
