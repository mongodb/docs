   :description: Specify `maxStalenessSeconds` to limit replication lag for reads from secondaries, ensuring they don't fall too far behind the primary's writes.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Replica set members can lag behind the :term:`primary` due to network
congestion, low disk throughput, long-running operations, etc. The read
preference ``maxStalenessSeconds`` option lets you specify a maximum
replication lag, or "staleness", for reads from :term:`secondaries
<secondary>`. When a secondary's estimated staleness exceeds
``maxStalenessSeconds``, the client stops using it for read operations.

.. note::

   :ref:`Flow control <replication-flow-control>` limits the rate at which
   the primary applies its writes with the goal of keeping :data:`majority
   committed <replSetGetStatus.optimes.lastCommittedOpTime>` lag under a
   specified maximum value.

You can specify ``maxStalenessSeconds`` with the following read
preference modes:

- :readmode:`primaryPreferred`
- :readmode:`secondary`
- :readmode:`secondaryPreferred`
- :readmode:`nearest`

Max staleness is not compatible with mode :readmode:`primary` and only
applies when :ref:`selecting
<replica-set-read-preference-behavior-member-selection>` a
:term:`secondary` member of a set for a read operation.

When selecting a server for a read operation with ``maxStalenessSeconds``, clients
estimate how stale each secondary is by comparing the secondary's last
write to that of the primary. The client will then direct the read
operation to a secondary whose estimated lag is less than or equal to
``maxStalenessSeconds``.

If there is no primary, the client uses the secondary with the most
recent write for the comparison.

By default, there is no maximum staleness and clients will not consider a
secondary's lag when choosing where to direct a read operation. 

You must specify a ``maxStalenessSeconds`` value of 90 seconds or
longer: specifying a smaller ``maxStalenessSeconds`` value will raise
an error. Clients estimate secondaries' staleness by periodically
checking the latest write date of each replica set member. Since these
checks are infrequent, the staleness estimate is coarse. Thus, clients
cannot enforce a ``maxStalenessSeconds`` value of less than 90 seconds.
