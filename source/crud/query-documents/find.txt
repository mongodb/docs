Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to retrieve documents from your MongoDB
database. You can find your documents by using the following:

- Retrieve a subset of documents from your collection using a :ref:`find operation <retrieve-find>`
- Perform transformations on retrieved documents from your collection using an :ref:`aggregate operation <retrieve-aggregate>`
- Monitor real-time changes to your database using :ref:`change streams <retrieve-watch>`

.. _retrieve-paint-order-collection:

Sample Data for Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections feature examples of how the owner of a paint
store manages their customers' orders. For each order, the owner keeps
track of the color and quantity, which corresponds to the ``color`` and
``qty`` fields in their ``paint_order`` collection:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": 1, "color": "purple", "qty": 10 }
   { "_id": 2, "color": "green", "qty": 8 }
   { "_id": 3, "color": "purple", "qty": 4 }
   { "_id": 4, "color": "green", "qty": 11 }

.. _retrieve-find:

Find Operation
--------------

Use the find operation to retrieve your documents from MongoDB. You can specify
which documents to retrieve, in what order to retrieve them, and how many to
retrieve. 

Call the ``find()`` method on an instance of a ``MongoCollection`` to filter for
documents that match the provided query. For more information about how to
specify a query, see our :ref:`java-query` guide.

You can then use methods such as ``forEach()``  or ``cursor()`` to retrieve
matching documents. For more information, see the `FindIterable
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/FindIterable.html>`__
API documentation.

To retrieve a single document, you can add the ``first()`` method to your
``find()`` call. To choose a specific document, you can use the ``sort()``
operation before selecting the first document. You may also want to use the
``limit()`` method to optimize memory usage. For more information, see the
server manual for more information about :manual:`memory optimization when using
the sort operation </reference/operator/aggregation/sort/#-sort----limit-memory-optimization>`. 

Example
~~~~~~~

The owner would like to know which orders contain greater than three, but
less than nine cans of paint from their :ref:`paint_order collection <retrieve-paint-order-collection>`.

To address this scenario, the owner finds orders to match the criteria:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Retrieve.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin findExample
   :end-before: end findExample

For more information about how to build filters, see our :ref:`Filters Builders
<filters-builders>` guide.

The following shows the output of the preceding query:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": 2, "color": "green", "qty": 8 }
   { "_id": 3, "color": "purple", "qty": 4 }

After the owner runs this query, they find two orders that matched the
criteria.

Find Example: Full File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/crud/example-intro.rst

This example is a complete, standalone file that performs the following actions:

- Calls the ``find()`` method to retrieve 10 documents that has a ``runtime``
  value less than ``15`` minutes, applying a projection and sort to the results  
- Calls the ``find()`` and ``first()`` methods to retrieve the document with the
  highest ``imdb.rating`` that is has a ``runtime`` value less than ``15``
  minutes, applying a projection to the result

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/crud/Find.java
      :language: java
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      10 movies under 15 minutes: 10 Minutes, 3x3, 7:35 in the Morning, 8, 9, A Chairy Tale, A Corner in Wheat, A Gentle Spirit, A Is for Autism, A Movie, 

      The highest rated movie under 15 minutes: {"title": "Andrè and Wally B.", "imdb": {"rating": 5.4, "votes": 3294, "id": 86855}}

.. _retrieve-aggregate:

Aggregate Operation
-------------------

Use the aggregate operation to perform the stages in an aggregation
pipeline.  An aggregation pipeline is a multi-staged transformation that
produces an aggregated result.

To perform an aggregate operation, call the ``aggregate()`` method on an
instance of a ``MongoCollection``. This method accepts aggregation
expressions to run in sequence. To perform aggregations, you can
define aggregation stages that specify how to match documents, rename
fields, and group values. For more information, see our
:ref:`Aggregation <java-aggregation>` guide and the :ref:`Aggregation Expression
Operations <java-aggregation-expression-operations>` page.

Example
~~~~~~~

The owner would like to know which paint color is the most purchased
(highest quantity sold) from their :ref:`paint_order collection <retrieve-paint-order-collection>`.

To address the scenario, the owner creates an aggregation pipeline that:

- Matches all the documents in the ``paint_order`` collection
- Groups orders by colors
- Sums up the quantity field by color
- Orders the results by highest-to-lowest quantity

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/Retrieve.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin aggregateExample
   :end-before: end aggregateExample

The following shows the output of the preceding aggregation:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": "green", "qty": 19 }
   { "_id": "purple", "qty": 14 }

After the owner runs the aggregation, they find that "green" is the most
purchased color.

For more information about how to construct an aggregation pipeline, see
the {+mdb-server+} manual page on :manual:`Aggregation </aggregation>`.
