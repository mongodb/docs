`MongoDB Enterprise
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced>`_
supports proxying authentication requests to a Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP) service.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/enterprise-availability-ldap.rst

Considerations
--------------

MongoDB Enterprise supports simple and SASL binding to Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers via ``saslauthd`` and operating system
libraries:

- MongoDB Enterprise for Linux can bind to an LDAP server either via
  ``saslauthd`` or through the operating system libraries.

- MongoDB Enterprise for Windows can bind to an LDAP server through the
  operating system libraries.

To learn how to set up LDAP and SASL, see the :manual:`LDAP Proxy Authentication </core/security-ldap>`
and :manual:`LDAP Authorization </core/security-ldap-external>` sections in
the MongoDB manual.

Procedure
---------

This procedure describes how to:

- Configure and enable LDAP authentication when using Automation.
- Rotate the LDAP password in |mms|, so that after that you can rotate
  the LDAP password on the LDAP server as well and then start using the
  new password seamlessly in |mms|.

  If |mms| doesn't manage {+magent+} or {+bagent+}, you must manually
  configure them to use |ldap|. To configure |ldap|, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-ldap`.
