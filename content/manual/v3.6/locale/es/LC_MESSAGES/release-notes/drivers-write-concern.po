"As of the releases listed below, there are two major changes to all "

"All drivers will add a new top-level connection class that will increase "

#: ../source/release-notes/drivers-write-concern.txt:32
msgid ""
"This change is non-backward breaking: existing connection classes will "
"remain in all drivers for a time, and will continue to operate as "
"expected. However, those previous connection classes are now deprecated "
"as of these releases, and will eventually be removed from the driver "
"interfaces."

#: ../source/release-notes/drivers-write-concern.txt:38

"The new top-level connection class is named ``MongoClient``, or similar "
"depending on how host languages handle namespacing."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/release-notes/drivers-write-concern.txt:41
msgid ""
"The default write concern on the new ``MongoClient`` class will be to "
"acknowledge all write operations [#without-arguments]_. This will allow "
"your application to receive acknowledgement of all write operations."

msgid ""
"The drivers will call :dbcommand:`getLastError` without arguments, which "
"is logically equivalent to the ``w: 1`` option; however, this operation "

":doc:`/reference/replica-configuration`."
