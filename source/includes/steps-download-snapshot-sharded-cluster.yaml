         |mms| prompts to choose the cluster to which to restore. You can
         select an existing cluster or create a new one. Follow the
         prompts and **skip the rest of this procedure.** Also skip the
         other procedures on this page.

       - |mms| provides you with the restore files, and you perform the
         restore manually.

  If you selected :guilabel:`Pull Via Secure HTTP`, |mms| creates links to
  the snapshot that by default are available for an hour and can be used
  just once. To download the snapshot files, click :guilabel:`Backup`,
  then the :guilabel:`Restore History` tab. When the restore job
  completes, a :guilabel:`download` link appears for each :term:`shard` and for
  one of the :term:`config servers <config server>`. Click each link to download
  the files and copy each to its server. For a shard, copy the file to
  every member of the shard's :term:`replica set`.

  If you selected :guilabel:`Push Via Secure Copy`, |mms| copies the files
  to the server directory you specfied. To verify that the files are
  complete, :ref:`see the section on how to validate an SCP restore
  <backup-faq-scp-validation>`. For each shard, copy its restore file to
  every member of the shard's :term:`replica set`.
