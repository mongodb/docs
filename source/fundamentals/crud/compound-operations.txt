Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to perform **compound operations**.

Compound operations combine a read and write operation into
a single operation.  If you perform a read and write operation
separately, there's a chance someone else may alter the document between
both operations. MongoDB prevents this by placing a write lock on the
document you are modifying for the duration of your compound operation.

MongoDB supports the following compound operations:

- :ref:`Find and delete one document <golang-find-and-delete>`
- :ref:`Find and update one document <golang-find-and-update>`
- :ref:`Find and replace one document <golang-find-and-replace>`

.. tip::
    
   If you need to read and write to more than one document, use
   :manual:`transactions </core/transactions/>`.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following snippet to load the documents into the ``tea.ratings`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/compoundOperations.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertDocs
   :end-before: end insertDocs

.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/tea-sample-data-ending.rst

.. _golang-find-and-delete:

Find and Delete
---------------

The ``FindOneAndDelete()`` method finds the first document that matches
the specified query filter and deletes it. The method returns a
``SingleResult`` containing the deleted document.

.. note:: 

   This method differs from the ``DeleteOne()`` method.
   ``FindOneAndDelete()`` performs a find and delete as a single
   operation, and eliminates the possibility of someone altering a
   document between both operations.

Modify Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``FindOneAndDelete()`` method by
passing in a ``FineOneAndDeleteOptions``. If you don't specify a
``FineOneAndDeleteOptions``, the driver uses the default values for each
option.

The ``FineOneAndDeleteOptions`` type allows you to configure options
with the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetCollation()``
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetMaxTime()``
     - | The maximum amount of time that the query can run on the server.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetProjection()``
     - | The fields to include in the document returned.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetSort()``
     - | The sort fields and directions to order the documents matched. 
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetHint()``
     - | The index to use to scan for documents.
       | Default: ``nil``

Example
```````

The following example matches and deletes a document where the ``type``
is "Assam" with the ``FindOneAndDelete()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/compoundOperations.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin FindOneAndDelete
   :end-before: end FindOneAndDelete

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {type Assam} {rating 5}]

.. _golang-find-and-update:

Find and Update
---------------

The ``FindOneAndUpdate()`` method finds the first document that matches
the specified query filter and updates it according to the update
document. The method returns a ``SingleResult`` containing the matched
document.

.. note:: 

   This method differs from the ``UpdateOne()`` method.
   ``FindOneAndUpdate()`` performs a find and update as a single
   operation, and eliminates the possibility of someone altering a
   document between both operations.

Modify Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``FindOneAndUpdate()`` method by
passing in a ``FineOneAndUpdateOptions``. If you don't specify a
``FineOneAndUpdateOptions``, the driver uses the default values for each
option.

The ``FineOneAndUpdateOptions`` type allows you to configure options
with the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetArrayFilters()``
     - | The array elements the update applies to.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetBypassDocumentValidation()``
     - | Whether to allow the write operation to opt-out of :manual:`document level validation </core/schema-validation>`.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetCollation()``
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.
       | Default: ``nil``
       
   * - ``SetMaxTime()``
     - | The maximum amount of time that the query can run on the server.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetProjection()``
     - | The fields to include in the document returned.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetReturnDocument()``
     - | Whether to return the original or updated document in the ``SingleResult``. 
       | Default: ``options.Before``

   * - ``SetSort()``
     - | The sort fields and directions to order the documents matched. 
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetUpsert()``
     - | Whether to insert a new document if the query filter doesn't match any documents. 
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetHint()``
     - | The index to use to scan for documents.
       | Default: ``nil``

Example
```````

The following example performs the following actions in order with the
``FindOneAndUpdate()`` method:

- Matches a document where the ``type`` is "Oolong"
- Updates the matched document's ``rating`` to ``9``
- Returns the updated document

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/compoundOperations.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin FindOneAndUpdate
   :end-before: end FindOneAndUpdate

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {type Oolong} {rating 9}]

.. _golang-find-and-replace:

Find and Replace
----------------

The ``FindOneAndReplace()`` method finds the first document that
matches the specified query filter and replaces it with the replacement
document. The method returns a ``SingleResult`` containing the matched
document.

.. note:: 

   This method differs from the ``ReplaceOne()`` method.
   ``FindOneAndReplace()`` performs a find and replace as a single
   operation, and eliminates the possibility of someone altering a
   document between both operations.

Modify Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``FindOneAndReplace()`` method by
passing in a ``FineOneAndReplaceOptions``. If you don't specify a
``FineOneAndReplaceOptions``, the driver uses the default values for each
option.

The ``FineOneAndReplaceOptions`` type allows you to configure options
with the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetBypassDocumentValidation()``
     - | Whether to allow the write operation to opt-out of :manual:`document level validation </core/schema-validation>`.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetCollation()``
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.
       | Default: ``nil``
       
   * - ``SetMaxTime()``
     - | The maximum amount of time that the query can run on the server.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetProjection()``
     - | The fields to include in the document returned.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetReturnDocument()``
     - | Whether to return the original or replaced document in the ``SingleResult``. 
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetSort()``
     - | The sort fields and directions to order the documents matched. 
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetUpsert()``
     - | Whether to insert a new document if the query filter doesn't match any documents. 
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetHint()``
     - | The index to use to scan for documents.
       | Default: ``nil``

Example
```````

The following example performs the following actions in order with the
``FindOneAndReplace()`` method:

- Matches a document where the ``type`` is "English Breakfast"
- Replaces the matched document with a new document where the ``type`` is "Ceylon" and  ``rating`` is ``6``

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/compoundOperations.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin FindOneAndReplace
   :end-before: end FindOneAndReplace

After running this example, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {type English Breakfast} {rating 5}]
