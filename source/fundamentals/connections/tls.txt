Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the **TLS protocol** to secure 
your connection to a MongoDB deployment. TLS is a cryptographic protocol
that secures communication between your application and MongoDB. To
configure your connection to use TLS, enable the TLS option and provide
your certificates for validation when creating a client.

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Enable TLS <rust-enable-tls>` describes ways to enable TLS on
  your connection

- :ref:`Configure Certificates <rust-configure-tls-certificates>`
  describes the certificates required to configure TLS

- :ref:`Reference Certificates in a Client <rust-client-tls-connect>`
  provides an example of how to create a ``TlsOptions`` struct to configure your
  TLS options

- :ref:`Additional Information <rust-tls-addtl-info>`
  provides links to resources and API documentation for types
  and methods mentioned in this guide

.. tip::
   
   To learn more about TLS, see the Wikipedia entry on
   :wikipedia:`Transport Layer Security <w/index.php?title=Transport_Layer_Security&oldid=1184063676>`.

.. _rust-enable-tls:

Enable TLS
----------

You can enable TLS on a connection to your MongoDB instance
in one of the following ways:

- Setting the ``tls`` option to ``true`` in your connection string
- Setting the ``tls`` field of a ``ClientOptions`` instance to
  the ``Tls::Enabled`` variant with an empty ``TlsOptions`` struct and
  instantiating a ``Client`` with those options

Select from the following :guilabel:`Connection String` and
:guilabel:`ClientOptions` tabs to see a corresponding code sample:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: connection string tls true

      .. code-block:: rust
         :emphasize-lines: 1

         let uri = "mongodb://<hostname>:<port>?tls=true"
         let client = Client::with_uri_str(uri).await?;

   .. tab:: ClientOptions
      :tabid: clientoptions tls true
      
      .. code-block:: rust
         :emphasize-lines: 4-5
         
         let uri = "<connection string>"
         let mut client_options = ClientOptions::parse(uri).await?;

         let tls_opts = TlsOptions::builder().build();
         client_options.tls = Some(Tls::Enabled(tls_opts));
         
         let client = Client::with_options(client_options)?;

.. note::
   
   If your connection string uses a DNS SRV record by including
   the ``mongodb+srv`` prefix, TLS is enabled on your connection by
   default.

For a full list of client options, see the
:ref:`rust-connection-options` guide.

.. _rust-configure-tls-certificates:

Configure Certificates
----------------------

To successfully initiate a TLS request, your application must present 
cryptographic certificates to prove its identity. Your application's
certificates must be stored as Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) files to
enable TLS when connecting to a MongoDB deployment. The PEM file format
is a container format for cryptographic certificates.

.. important::

   For production use, we recommend that your MongoDB deployment use valid
   certificates generated and signed by the same certificate authority.
   For testing, your deployment can use self-signed certificates.

The following list describes the components that your client must
present to establish a TLS-enabled connection:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - TLS Component
     - Description

   * - Certificate Authority (CA)
     - One or more certificate authorities to
       trust when making a TLS connection

   * - Client Certificate
     - A digital certificate that allows the server to verify the identity
       of your application to establish an encrypted network connection

   * - Certificate Key
     - The client certificate private key file, often
       included within the certificate file itself

   * - Passphrase
     - The password to decrypt the private client key if it is encrypted

.. _rust-client-tls-connect:

Reference Certificates in a Client
----------------------------------

You must reference your certificates in your ``TlsOptions``
struct so that the server can validate them before the client connects.

You must first convert your certificate filepaths to
``PathBuf`` types, so you must import this type from the ``std::path``
module. Then, call the ``TlsOptions`` struct's builder functions
to set the ``ca_file_path`` and ``cert_key_file_path`` fields to the
certificate filepaths.

Within your ``TlsOptions`` instance, you can set optional
fields to configure TLS on your connection. For **testing purposes**,
you can set the ``allow_invalid_certificates`` and
``allow_invalid_hostnames`` fields.

Setting the ``allow_invalid_certificates`` option to ``true`` disables
hostname verification, and setting the
``allow_invalid_hostnames`` to ``true`` disables certificate
validation.

.. warning::

   Specifying either of these options in a production environment makes
   your application insecure and potentially vulnerable to expired
   certificates and to foreign processes posing as valid client
   instances.

.. _rust-tls-full-example:

Example
~~~~~~~

This example performs the following actions to create a ``TlsOptions``
instance and a ``Client`` instance that is configured for TLS:

1. Creates variables to reference the certificate filepaths in
   ``PathBuf`` instances.

#. Creates a variable to store the password used to decrypt the 
   client key.

#. Instantiates a ``TlsOptions`` struct and sets the ``ca_file_path``,
   ``cert_key_file_path``, and ``tls_certificate_key_file_password`` fields
   to configure the TLS-enabled connection.

#. Passes the ``TlsOptions`` instance to the ``Enabled`` variant of the
   ``Tls`` enum.

#. Sets the ``tls`` field of the ``ClientOptions`` struct to the
   ``Tls::Enabled`` variant containing the ``TlsOptions`` instance.

#. Creates a ``Client`` instance with these options.
