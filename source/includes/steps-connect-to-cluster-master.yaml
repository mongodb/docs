  button for the cluster to which you wish to connect.

  |service| only allows client connections to the cluster from entries
  in the :ref:`project's whitelist <whitelist>`.

  The :guilabel:`Setup Connection Security` step lets you know if you
  have a whitelisted address through which you can connect to your
  cluster. If the whitelist is not empty but you need to add another
  entry, |service| directs you to the :ref:`IP Whitelist
  <add-to-whitelist>` tab.

  If the whitelist is empty, |service| prompts you to add an IP
  address to the project's whitelist. You can either:

  * Click :guilabel:`Add Your Current IP Address` to whitelist your
    current IP address.

  * Click :guilabel:`Add a Different IP Address` to add a single IP
    address or a CIDR-notated range of addresses.

    For |service| clusters deployed on :ref:`amazon-aws` *and* using
    :ref:`VPC Peering <vpc-peering>`, you can add a Security Group
    associated with the peer :abbr:`VPC (Virtual Private Connection)`.

  You can provide an optional description for the newly added IP
  address or :abbr:`CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)` range.
  Click :guilabel:`Add IP Address` to add the address to the
  whitelist.

  To access the cluster, you must create a MongoDB user with access to
  the desired database(s) on the cluster.

  The :guilabel:`Setup Connection Security` step lets you know if you
  have a MongoDB user that can connect to your cluster. If you have a
  MongoDB user on the cluster but need to add another, |service|
  directs you to the :ref:`Users <mongodb-users>` tab.

  If you do not have any MongoDB users created, |service| prompts you
  to create a new user which will have the
  :ref:`Atlas Admin <atlas-user-privileges>` privilege. Enter the
  new user's :guilabel:`Username` and :guilabel:`Password` and click
  :guilabel:`Create MongoDB User` to save the user. You can use this
  user to connect to your cluster in the following step.

  Once you have whitelisted an IP address and added a MongoDB user,
  click :guilabel:`Choose Your Connection Method`.
