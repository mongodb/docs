Overview
--------

When you first create an App, you must select a
:ref:`deployment type <realm-deployment-models>` that determines where
your application's data is stored and processed. You can deploy your
App globally or limit the deployment to a specific
:ref:`cloud deployment region <deployment-regions>`.

.. _realm-deployment-models:

Deployment Models
-----------------

.. _global-deployment:

Global Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A globally deployed App is hosted across the world in all of the
following AWS regions:

- Ireland (IE) - ``aws-eu-west-1``
- Oregon (US-OR) - ``aws-us-west-2``
- Sydney (AU) - ``aws-ap-southeast-2``
- Virginia (US-VA) - ``aws-us-east-1``

An App can handle most types of requests from any region. For example,
any region can run serverless functions, evaluate rules, validate object
schemas, or authenticate users.

All write operations to a linked MongoDB data source are handled within
a single region that you specify when you create the App. You can choose
any global region to handle writes, but should generally choose the
region closest to your MongoDB cluster. If a server in another region
needs to handle a write request, it forwards the request to the
configured write region, which adds latency to the write operation.

Realm SDKs automatically execute application requests, such as reading
user information or calling a function, in the global deployment region
that's closest to the user that issued the request. Requests sent to a
global URL (for example, with the Data API) are forwarded to the
closest server at the DNS level. Requests sent to a region-specific URL
execute in that region regardless of the user's location.

.. _local-deployment:

Local Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A locally deployed App is available in a single cloud provider region.
All requests and MongoDB write operations are handled exclusively in the
region, which you specify when you create the App.

You can deploy to any region, but should generally choose the region
closest to your application's users.

.. _deployment-regions:

Cloud Deployment Regions
------------------------

You can deploy your App to cloud regions hosted around the world by the major
cloud providers.  Support for a given region depends on your :ref:`deployment
model <realm-deployment-models>`. Global deployment has fewer supported regions
than local deployment.

If you don't specify a region when creating or configuring your App, App
Services selects the region geographically closest to your selected data source.

App Services supports the following regions:
