You can configure |onprem| to encrypt connections from the Monitoring
and Backup Agents to |onprem|, from website clients to the |onprem|
Admin interface, and from command-line clients, such as ``curl``, to 
the REST API. You can encrypt connections in the following ways:

- Set up an |https| proxy in front of |onprem|.

- Run the |application| over |https|, as described here.
 
The following procedure configures |onprem| with a ``.pem`` file that
contains the |onprem| host's |tls-ssl| certificate and private key. If
you are using automation, the :term:`Automation Agent` automatically
updates the Monitoring and Backup agents for |https| after successfully
completing the procedure.

If you are not using automation, you must manually configure all of the
agents using the same procedure. By default, |onprem| accesses |https| 
on port ``8443``.
