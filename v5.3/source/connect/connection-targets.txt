Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use a connection string and a ``MongoClient`` object
to connect to different types of MongoDB deployments.

Atlas
-----

To connect to a MongoDB deployment on Atlas, include the following elements
in your connection string:

- The URL of your Atlas cluster
- Your MongoDB username
- Your MongoDB password

Then, pass your connection string to the ``MongoClient`` constructor.

.. tip::

   Follow the :atlas:`Atlas driver connection guide </driver-connection>`
   to retrieve your connection string.

When you connect to Atlas, we recommend using the {+stable-api+} client option to avoid
breaking changes when Atlas upgrades to a new version of {+mdb-server+}.
To learn more about the {+stable-api+} feature, see the :ref:`<scala-stable-api>`
guide.

The following code shows how to use the {+driver-short+} to connect to an Atlas cluster. The
code also uses the ``serverApi()`` method to specify a {+stable-api+} version.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-target.scala
   :language: scala
   :start-after: start-connect
   :end-before: end-connect
   :dedent:

Local Deployments
-----------------

You can connect to a local MongoDB deployment in the following ways:

- Instantiate a ``MongoClient`` object without any parameters to
  connect to a MongoDB server running on ``localhost`` on port ``27017``:

  .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-targets-local-replica.scala
   :language: scala
   :start-after: start-connect-local
   :end-before: end-connect-local
   :dedent:

- Explicitly specify the ``hostname`` to connect to a MongoDB
  instance running on the specified host on port ``27017``: 

  .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-targets-local-replica.scala
   :language: scala
   :start-after: start-connect-local-host
   :end-before: end-connect-local-host
   :dedent:  

- Explicitly specify the ``hostname`` and the ``port``:

  .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-targets-local-replica.scala
   :language: scala
   :start-after: start-connect-local-host-port
   :end-before: end-connect-local-host-port
   :dedent:

Replica Sets
------------

To connect to a replica set, specify the hostnames (or IP addresses) and 
port numbers of the replica set members.

If you aren't able to provide a full list of hosts in the replica set, you can 
specify one or more of the hosts in the replica set and instruct the {+driver-short+} to 
perform automatic discovery to find the others. To instruct the driver to perform
automatic discovery, perform one of the following actions:

- Specify the name of the replica set as the value of the ``replicaSet`` parameter.
- Specify ``false`` as the value of the ``directConnection`` parameter.
- Specify more than one host in the replica set.

You can connect to a MongoDB replica set by specifying the members in a 
``ConnectionString``. The following example shows how to specify three members 
of the replica set:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-targets-local-replica.scala
   :language: scala
   :start-after: start-replica-set
   :end-before: end-replica-set
   :dedent:

The following example shows how to specify members of the replica set and the 
``replicaSet`` option with the replica set name:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-targets-local-replica.scala
   :language: scala
   :start-after: start-replica-set-option
   :end-before: end-replica-set-option
   :dedent:

The following example shows how to specify a list of ``ServerAddress`` instances 
corresponding to all of the replica set members:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/connection-targets-local-replica.scala
   :language: scala
   :start-after: start-replica-set-server-address
   :end-before: end-replica-set-server-address
   :dedent:

.. note::

   The ``MongoClient`` constructor is *non-blocking*.
   When you connect to a replica set, the constructor returns immediately while the
   client uses background threads to connect to the replica set.
   
   If you construct a ``MongoClient`` and immediately print the string representation
   of its ``nodes`` attribute, the list might be empty while the client connects to
   the replica-set members.
