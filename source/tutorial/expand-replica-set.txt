Overview
--------

This tutorial explains how to add an additional member to an existing
:term:`replica set`. For background on replication deployment patterns,
see the :doc:`/core/replica-set-architectures` document.

Maximum Voting Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A replica set can have a maximum of seven :ref:`voting members
<replica-set-election-internals>`. To add a member to a replica set
that already has seven voting members, you must either add the member as a
:ref:`non-voting member <replica-set-non-voting-members>` or remove a
vote from an :rsconf:`existing member <members[n].votes>`.

Init Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In production deployments you can configure a :term:`init script`
to manage member processes.

Existing Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use these procedures to add new members to an existing
set. You can also use the same procedure to "re-add" a removed
member. If the removed member's data is still relatively recent, it
can recover and catch up easily.


Data Files
~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a backup or snapshot of an existing member, you can move
the data files (e.g.  the :setting:`~storage.dbPath` directory) to a new system
and use them to quickly initiate a new member. The files must be:

- A valid copy of the data files from a member of the same replica
  set. See :doc:`/tutorial/backup-with-filesystem-snapshots`
  document for more information.

  .. important:: Always use filesystem snapshots to create a copy of a
     member of the existing replica set. **Do not** use
     :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` to seed a new
     replica set member.

- More recent than the oldest operation in the :term:`primary's
  <primary>` :term:`oplog`. The new member must be able to become
  current by applying operations from the primary's oplog.

IP Binding

Requirements
------------

#. An active replica set.

#. A new MongoDB system capable of supporting your data set, accessible by
   the active replica set through the network.

Otherwise, use the MongoDB :ref:`installation tutorial
<tutorials-installation>` and the :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set`
tutorials.

Procedures
----------


Prepare the Data Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before adding a new member to an existing :term:`replica set`, prepare
the new member's :term:`data directory <dbpath>` using one of the
following strategies:

- Make sure the new member's data directory *does not* contain data. The
  new member will copy the data from an existing member.

  If the new member is in a :term:`recovering` state, it must exit and
  become a :term:`secondary` before MongoDB
  can copy all data as part of the replication process. This process
  takes time but does not require administrator intervention.

- Manually copy the data directory from an existing member. The new
  member becomes a secondary member and will catch up to the current
  state of the replica set. Copying the data over may shorten the
  amount of time for the new member to become current.

  Ensure that you can copy the data directory to the new member and
  begin replication within the :ref:`window allowed by the oplog
  <replica-set-oplog-sizing>`. Otherwise, the new instance will have
  to perform an initial sync, which completely resynchronizes the
  data, as described in :doc:`/tutorial/resync-replica-set-member`.

  Use :method:`rs.printReplicationInfo()` to check the current state
  of replica set members with regards to the oplog.

For background on replication deployment patterns, see the
:doc:`/core/replica-set-architectures` document.

Add a Member to an Existing Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/tip-hostnames.rst

1. Start the new :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. Specify the data directory
   and the replica set name. The following example specifies the
   ``/srv/mongodb/db0`` data directory and the ``rs0`` replica set:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /srv/mongodb/db0 --replSet rs0  --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

   .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

   For more information on configuration options, see the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` manual page.

   .. optional::

      You can specify the data directory, replica set name, and the ip
      binding in the ``mongod.conf`` :doc:`configuration file
      </reference/configuration-options>`, and start the
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf

#. Connect to the replica set's primary.

   You can only add members while connected to the primary. If you do
   not know which member is the primary, log into any member of the
   replica set and issue the :method:`db.isMaster()` command.

#. Use :method:`rs.add()` to add the new member to the replica set. 
   Pass the :rsconf:`member configuration document <members>` to the
   method.  For example, to add a member at host
   ``mongodb3.example.net``, issue the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.add( { host: "mongodb3.example.net:27017", priority: 0, votes: 0 } )

   .. tip:: 

      .. include:: /includes/tip-repl-set-add-members.rst

#. Ensure that the new member has reached :replstate:`SECONDARY` state.
   To check the state of the replica set members, run
   :method:`rs.status()`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

   rs.status()

#. Once the newly added member has transitioned into
   :replstate:`SECONDARY` state, use :method:`rs.reconfig()` to update
   the newly added member's :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` and
   :rsconf:`~members[n].votes` if needed.

   For example, if :method:`rs.conf()` returns the configuration
   document for ``mongodb3.example.net:27017`` as the fifth element in
   the :rsconf:`members` array, to update its priority and votes to
   ``1``, use the following sequence of operations:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var cfg = rs.conf();
      cfg.members[4].priority = 1
      cfg.members[4].votes = 1
      rs.reconfig(cfg)
