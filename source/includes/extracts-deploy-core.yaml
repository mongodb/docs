  deployment. |mms| displays this field if your deployment runs
  MongoDB version 3.4 or later.
---
ref: deploy-replica-set-id
content: |
  Enter the name of your replica set deployment. You cannot change
  this once set. This setting corresponds to the
  :rsconf:`_id <rsconf._id>` replica configuration option.
---
ref: deploy-replica-set-settings
content: |
  Displays an table of each process associated with the replica
  set. You can configure the MongoDB server version, data directory,
  and log path of each process.

---
ref: deploy-process-name
content: |
  Hostname and port of a |mongod| process. This hostname can be a
  hostname, an |fqdn|, an |ipv4| address, or an |ipv6| address. |mms|
  initially groups each process under the replica set name. Click the
  :icon:`caret-right` to the left of the replica set name to display
  all |mongod| processes in the replica set.

  |mms| applies any settings configured for the replica set to all
  of its associated processes.

---
ref: deploy-version
content: |
  Select the MongoDB server version of the {{PROCESS}} process.

  .. include:: /includes/admonitions/available-mongodb-versions.rst

ref: deploy-data-directory
content: |

  Specify the directory where the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process stores
  data files. This setting corresponds to the
  :setting:`storage.dbPath` :binary:`~bin.mongod` configuration file
  option. The |mms| {+aagent+} must have file system permission
  to read, write, and execute all files and folders in the
  specified directory.

  Each :binary:`~bin.mongod` process must have its own database
  directory. If deploying multiple :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  processes on the same host, ensure each process has its own
  distinct directory.

---
ref: deploy-log-file
content: |
  Specify the full path to the {{PROCESS}} log file, including the
  log file name and extension. This setting corresponds to the
  :setting:`systemLog.path` configuration file option. The

  specified file.

  For example, specifying ``/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log`` directs the
  {{PROCESS}} to store its logfile in ``/var/log/mongodb/`` as
  ``mongo.log``.

  The {{PROCESS}} must have its own unique log file. If deploying multiple
  {{PROCESS}} processes to the same host, ensure each {{PROCESS}} has
  its own distinct logfile.

  :manual:`getLastError </reference/command/getLastError/>` specify
  no other write concern.

  If this option is not set, the default write concern for the
  replica set only requires confirmation from the :manual:`primary </reference/glossary/#std-term-primary>`.

  Specify this option in the form of a document, i.e., ``{"w":2}``.

---
ref: deploy-member-replication-force-reconfigure
