You can modify configuration and topology of the |mongodb-multi|, including
its MongoDB versions, storage engines, and |k8s| clusters.

Considerations
--------------

- You can't change individual members of a replica set, you can change only
  the whole set or |k8s| cluster.
  For a complete list of options supported by a |mongodb-multi|,
  see the :ref:`multi-cluster-specification`.

- You can configure certain settings only using |k8s-op-short|. To learn
  more, see :ref:`k8s-exclusive-settings`.

Prerequisites
-------------

To update a |mongodb-multi|, you must have it installed and deployed.
