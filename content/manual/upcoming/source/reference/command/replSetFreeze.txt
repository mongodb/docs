Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: replSetFreeze

   The :dbcommand:`replSetFreeze` command prevents a replica set
   member from seeking election for the specified number of
   seconds. Use this command in conjunction with the
   :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` command to make a different node in
   the replica set a primary.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-no-free-or-m10.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst


Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {   
        replSetFreeze: <seconds> 
      }
   )

Behavior
--------

If you want to unfreeze a replica set member before the specified number
of seconds has elapsed, you can issue the command with a seconds
value of ``0``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      { 
        replSetFreeze: 0 
      }
   )

Restarting the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process also unfreezes a replica
set member.

:dbcommand:`replSetFreeze` is an administrative command, and you
must issue it against the :term:`admin database`.
