Chunk migration moves the chunks of a sharded collection from one shard
to another and is part of the :doc:`balancer
</core/sharding-balancing>` process.

Chunk Migration
---------------

MongoDB migrates chunks in a :term:`sharded cluster` to distribute the
chunks of a sharded collection evenly among shards. Migrations may be
either:

- Manual. Only use manual migration in limited cases, such as
  to distribute data during bulk inserts. See :ref:`Migrating Chunks
  Manually <sharding-balancing-manual-migration>` for more details.

- Automatic. The :doc:`balancer </core/sharding-balancing>` process
  automatically handles most migrations when there is an uneven
  distribution of a sharded collection's chunks across shards. See
  :ref:`Migration Thresholds <sharding-migration-thresholds>` for more
  details.

All chunk migrations use the following procedure:

#. The balancer process sends the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command to
   the source shard. In this operation, the balancer
   passes the name of the destination shard to the source shard.

#. The source starts the move with an internal :dbcommand:`moveChunk`   
   command and tracks incoming write operations. During the migration
   process, operations to the chunk route to the source shard.

#. The destination shard begins requesting documents in the chunk and
   starts receiving copies of the data.

#. After receiving the final document in the chunk, the destination
   shard starts a synchronization process to ensure that it has the
   changes to the migrated documents that occured during the migration.

#. When fully synchronized, the destination shard connects to the
   :term:`config database` and updates the chunk location in the
   cluster metadata.

#. After the destination shard completes the update of the metadata, and
   once there are no open cursors on the chunk, the source shard starts
   deleting its copy of documents.

The migration process ensures consistency and maximizes availability of
chunks during balancing.

   While copying and deleting data during migrations, the balancer
   waits for replication to secondaries. See :v2.2:`Secondary Throttle
   in the v2.2 Manual
   </tutorial/configure-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle>`
   for details.
