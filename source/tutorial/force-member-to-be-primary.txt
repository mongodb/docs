Synopsis
--------

You can force a :term:`replica set` member to become :term:`primary`
by giving it a higher
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` value than any other
member in the set.

Optionally, you also can force a member never to become primary by
setting its :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].priority` value to
``0``, which means the member can never seek :ref:`election
<replica-set-elections>` as primary. For more information, see
:ref:`replica-set-secondary-only-members`.

Force a Member to be Primary by Setting its Priority High
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 2.0

For more information on priorities, see :ref:`replica-set-node-priority`.

This procedure assumes your current :term:`primary` is
``m1.example.net`` and that you'd like to instead make ``m3.example.net`` primary.
The procedure also assumes you have a three-member :term:`replica set` with the
configuration below. For more information on configurations, see :ref:`Replica Set
Configuration Use <replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>`.

This procedure assumes this configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "_id" : "rs",
       "version" : 7,
       "members" : [
           {
               "_id" : 0,
               "host" : "m1.example.net:27017"
           },
           {
               "_id" : 1,
               "host" : "m2.example.net:27017"
           },
           {
               "_id" : 2,
               "host" : "m3.example.net:27017"
           }
       ]
   }

1. In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, use the following sequence of operations
   to make ``m3.example.net`` the primary:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg = rs.conf()
      cfg.members[0].priority = 0.5
      cfg.members[1].priority = 0.5
      cfg.members[2].priority = 1
      rs.reconfig(cfg)

   This sets ``m3.example.net`` to have a higher
   :data:`local.system.replset.members[n].priority` value than the other :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instances.

   The following sequence of events occur:

   - ``m3.example.net`` and ``m2.example.net`` sync with
     ``m1.example.net`` (typically within 10 seconds).

   - ``m1.example.net`` sees that it no longer has highest priority and,
     in most cases, steps down. ``m1.example.net`` *does not* step down
     if ``m3.example.net``'s sync is far behind. In that case,
     ``m1.example.net`` waits until ``m3.example.net`` is within 10
     seconds of its optime and then steps down. This minimizes the
     amount of time with no primary following failover.

   - The step down forces on election in which ``m3.example.net``
     becomes primary based on its :data:`priority
     <local.system.replset.members[n].priority>` setting.

#. Optionally, if ``m3.example.net`` is more than 10 seconds behind
   ``m1.example.net``'s optime, and if you don't need to have a primary
   designated within 10 seconds, you can force ``m1.example.net`` to
   step down by running:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand({replSetStepDown:1000000, force:1})

   This prevents ``m1.example.net`` from being primary for 1,000,000
   seconds, even if there is no other member that can become primary.
   When ``m3.example.net`` catches up with ``m1.example.net`` it will
   become primary.

   If you later want to make ``m1.example.net``
   primary again while it waits for ``m3.example.net`` to catch up,
   issue the following command to make ``m1.example.net`` seek election
   again:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.freeze()

   The :method:`rs.freeze()` provides a wrapper around the
   :dbcommand:`replSetFreeze` database command.

Force a Member to be Primary Using Database Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 1.8

Consider a :term:`replica set` with the following members:

- ``mdb0.example.net`` - the  current :term:`primary`.
- ``mdb1.example.net`` - a :term:`secondary`.
- ``mdb2.example.net`` - a secondary .

To force a member to become primary use the following procedure:

1. In a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, run :method:`rs.status()` to ensure your replica
   set is running as expected.

#. In a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected to the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instance running on ``mdb2.example.net``, freeze
   ``mdb2.example.net`` so that it does not attempt to become primary
   for 120 seconds.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.freeze(120)

#. In a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected the :binary:`~bin.mongod` running
   on ``mdb0.example.net``, step down this instance that the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` is not eligible to become primary for 120
   seconds:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.stepDown(120)

   ``mdb1.example.net`` becomes primary.

   .. note:: During the transition, there is a short window where
      the set does not have a primary.

For more information, consider the :method:`rs.freeze()` and
:method:`rs.stepDown()` methods that wrap the
:dbcommand:`replSetFreeze` and :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` commands.
