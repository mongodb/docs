Overview
--------

MongoDB provides the following commands, methods, and operator that
perform server-side execution of JavaScript code:

- :dbcommand:`mapReduce` and the corresponding :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
  method :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`.  For more
  information, see :doc:`/core/map-reduce`.

- :query:`$where` operator that evaluates a JavaScript expression or a
  function in order to query for documents.

- :group:`$accumulator` and :expression:`$function` aggregation
  operations that allows users to define custom aggregation expressions.

You can also specify a JavaScript file to the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to
run on the server. For more information, see
:ref:`running-js-scripts-in-mongo-on-mongod-host`

If you do not need to perform server-side execution of JavaScript code,
see :ref:`disable-server-side-js`.

Running ``.js`` files via a ``mongo`` shell Instance on the Server
------------------------------------------------------------------

You can specify a JavaScript (``.js``) file to a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
instance to execute the file on the server. This is a good technique
for performing batch administrative work. When you run :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell on the server, connecting via the localhost interface, the
connection is fast with low latency.

Concurrency
-----------

Refer to the individual method or operator documentation for any
concurrency information. See also the :ref:`concurrency table
<faq-concurrency-operations-locks>`.
