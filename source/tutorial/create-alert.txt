Create an Alert
===============

Overview
--------

You can create an alert from scratch or clone it from an existing alert.
This section describes both.

To implement alert escalation, you can create multiple alerts with
different minimum frequencies. MMS processes alerts on a 5-minuet
interval. Therefore, the minimum frequency for an alert is 5 minutes. The
time between re-notifications increases by the frequency amount every
alert cycle (e.g. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, etc.) up
to a maximum of 24 hours.

When an alert state triggers, you can set a time to elapse before
MMS will send alert messages at the specified interval. This helps eliminate false
positives. Type in the :guilabel:`after waiting` field the number of minutes to
wait before sending the alert at the specified interval for each recipient.

Costs to send alerts depend on your telephone service contract. Many factors
may affect alert delivery, including do not call lists, caps for messages
sent or delivered, delivery time of day, and message caching.

   - If you select **Group** and check the **SMS** box, then MMS sends
     alert text messages to all users in the group who have filled
     in their Mobile Number in the Settings page.

   - If you select **User** and check the **SMS** box, then MMS sends
     alert text messages to the user's Mobile Number specified in
     their Settings page.

   - MMS sends alert emails as multipart messages containing both HTML
     and plain text content. This way, the recipient's email client
     can choose the appropriate message format for display.
