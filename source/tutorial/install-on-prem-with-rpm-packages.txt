Overview

To install |onprem| you install the :ref:`mms-application-package` and the
optional :ref:`Backup Daemon <backup-daemon>`. This tutorial describes how
to install both using ``rpm`` packages. The |application| monitors MongoDB
deployments, and the Backup Daemon creates and stores deployment
snapshots.

If you are instead upgrading an existing deployment, please see
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/upgrade-application-daemon`.
