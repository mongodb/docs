  Provision a host for |onprem| that meets the following requirements:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 30 70
     :stub-columns: 1

     * - System Memory
       - 15 GB
     * - Disk Capacity
       - 50 GB in ``/`` (The root directory of this host)
     * - Host OS Permissions
       - ``root``
     * - Host OS
       - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0

  .. admonition:: Using |aws|
     :class: note

     An |aws| EC2 ``t3a.xlarge`` instance meets the memory
     requirements. Change the size of the instance's root partition to
     50 GB. Log in to the instance and execute ``df -h`` to verify the
     root partition has 50 GB of space.

title: "Configure ``yum`` to install MongoDB."
ref: config-yum
level: 4
content: |

  Create a ``/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-4.4.repo`` file so
  that you can install MongoDB directly using ``yum``:

  .. code-block:: cfg

     [mongodb-org-4.4]
     name=MongoDB Repository
     baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-org/4.4/x86_64/

title: "Disable the |mongod| service."
ref: disable-mongodb-service-for-appdb
optional: true
level: 4
content: |

  The |onprem| attaches to its application database on port 27017. If
  the host on which you want to install the application database is
  already running a |mongod|, you need to disable it.

  Invoke the following command to disable the |mongod| service:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo systemctl disable mongod

title: "Create the |onprem| Application Database directory."
ref: create-data-dir

  Issue the following two commands to create the data directory and
  change its ownership:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo mkdir -p /data/appdb
     sudo chown -R mongod:mongod /data

stepnum: 6
title: "Update the MongoDB configuration file."
ref: update-mdb-conf-file
level: 4
content: |

  When you install MongoDB, it creates a configuration file saved at
  ``/etc/mongod.conf``. Open this file with your preferred text editor.
  Make the following changes to the file:

  .. code-block:: yaml
     :linenos:

     systemLog:
        destination: file
        path: "/data/appdb/mongodb.log"
        logAppend: true
     storage:
        dbPath: "/data/appdb"
        journal:
           enabled: true
        wiredTiger:
           engineConfig:
              cacheSizeGB: 1
     processManagement:

     net:
        port: 27017
     setParameter:
        enableLocalhostAuthBypass: false

  #. Navigate to the :dl:`Ops Manager Download Center <ops-manager>`.

  #. From the :guilabel:`Platforms` drop-down menu, click
     :guilabel:`Red Hat + CentOS 6, 7, 8 / SUSE 12 + 15 / Amazon Linux`.

  #. From the :guilabel:`Packages` drop-down menu, click
     :guilabel:`RPM`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Download`.

  .. note::

     The downloaded package is named
     ``mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.rpm``, where ``<version>`` is the
     version number.

title: "Copy the |onprem| ``.rpm`` package to your host."
optional: true
ref: copy-rpm-installer
level: 4
content: |

  If you are installing |onprem| on a remote host, such as a cloud
  provider compute instance, use ``scp`` to copy the installer to your
  host:

  .. code-block:: sh

     scp -i <keyfile> mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.rpm ec2-user@<public-ip>:~

---
stepnum: 10
title: "Install |onprem|."
ref: install

  Install the ``.rpm`` package by issuing the following command, where
  ``<version>`` is the version of the |onprem| ``.rpm`` package:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo rpm -ivh mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.rpm

  The install creates the following:

  - The base directory for the |onprem| software, which is:

    ``/opt/mongodb/mms/``

  - A new system user, ``mongodb-mms``, under which the host runs.

  - The ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties`` file, which
    contains the connection string to access the Application Database
    in :setting:`mongo.mongoUri` setting. The default value is
    ``locahost``, port ``27017``, so no changes are necessary.

  If you are using an EC2 instance, the hostname is the ``Public DNS``
  listed on the EC2 instance's ``Description`` tab.

  If you do not have a hostname, you can instead use the public IP
  address. To get the public IP address, paste this |url| into your
  preferred browser:

  .. code-block:: sh
