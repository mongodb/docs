Multikey indexes collect and sort data from fields containing array
values. Multikey indexes improve performance for queries on array
fields.

When you create an index on a field that contains an array value, 
MongoDB automatically sets that index to be a multikey index.

MongoDB can create multikey indexes over arrays that hold both scalar
values (for example, strings and numbers) and embedded documents.
If an array contains multiple instances of the same value, the index
only includes one entry for the value.

To create a multikey index, use the following prototype:

.. include:: /includes/indexes/code-examples/create-multikey-index.rst

This image shows a multikey index on the ``addr.zip`` field:

Use Cases
---------

If your application frequently queries a field that contains an array
value, a multikey index improves performance for those queries.

For example, documents in a ``movies`` collection contain a
``genres`` field: an array of genres associated with each movie.
You regularly query movies that have specific genres, such as
finding all movies that are both ``Drama`` and ``Action``.

You can create an index on the ``genres`` field to improve
performance for this query. Because ``genres`` contains an array
value, MongoDB stores the index as a multikey index.

Get Started
-----------

To create a multikey index, see:

- :ref:`index-create-multikey-scalar`
- :ref:`index-create-multikey-embedded`

Details
-------

This section describes technical details and limitations for multikey
indexes.

Index Bounds
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bounds of an index scan define the parts of an index to search
during a query. The computation of multikey index bounds follows special
rules. For details, see :ref:`indexes-multikey-bounds`.

Unique Multikey Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a :ref:`unique <index-type-unique>` multikey index, a document may
have array elements that result in repeating index key values as long as
the index key values for that document do not duplicate those of another
document.

To learn more and see an example of this behavior, see
:ref:`unique-separate-documents`.

.. _compound_multikey_indexes:

Compound Multikey Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a :ref:`compound <index-type-compound>` multikey index, each indexed
document can have *at most* one indexed field whose value is an array.
Specifically:

- You cannot create a compound multikey index if more than one field in
  the index specification is an array. 

- If a compound multikey index already exists, you cannot insert a
  document that would violate this restriction.

For example, you can create a compound multikey index ``{ genres: 1, year: 1
}`` on the ``movies`` collection because for each document, only one field
indexed by the compound multikey index is an array. No document contains array
values for both ``genres`` and ``year`` fields.

However, after you create the compound multikey index, if you attempt
to insert a document where both ``genres`` and ``year``
fields are arrays, the insert fails.

Sorting
~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-multikey-index-sort-limitation.rst

Shard Keys
~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot specify a multikey index as a shard key index.

However, if the shard key index is a :ref:`prefix
<compound-index-prefix>` of a compound index, the compound index may
become a compound *multikey* index if one of the trailing keys (that are
not part of the shard key) indexes an array.

Hashed Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Hashed indexes <index-type-hashed>` cannot be multikey.

.. _multikey-covered-queries:

Covered Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multikey indexes can cover queries when these conditions are met:

- The query does not return the array field (meaning the array is not
  included in the query projection). This means that to cover a query,
  the multikey index must be :ref:`compound
  <compound_multikey_indexes>`.

- The query does not include :query:`$elemMatch`.

- The query meets all other :ref:`covered query requirements
  <covered-queries>`.

For example, the following operation creates a compound multikey index on the
``movies`` collection on the ``genres`` and ``title`` fields:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/indexes/multikey/compound-multikey.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example

The preceding index is multikey because the ``genres`` field contains
array values.

The index covers these queries:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/indexes/multikey/query-1.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/indexes/multikey/query-2.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example

The index does not cover the following query because the projection
contains the ``genres`` array field:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/indexes/multikey/query-3.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example

Query on an Array Field as a Whole
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a query specifies an :ref:`exact match for an array as a whole
<array-match-exact>`, MongoDB uses the multikey index to locate
documents that contain the first element of that array. However, it cannot
match the entire array using the index alone. MongoDB then fetches the
candidate documents and filters them to return only those whose array
exactly matches the query array.

For example, the following operation creates a multikey index on the ``movies``
collection on the ``genres`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/indexes/multikey/array-field.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example

The following query looks for documents where the ``genres`` field is
the array ``[ "Drama" ]``:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/indexes/multikey/query-4.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example

MongoDB can use the multikey index to find documents that have ``"Drama"`` at
any position in the ``genres`` array. Then, MongoDB retrieves these
documents and filters for documents whose ``genres`` array equals the
query array ``[ "Drama" ]``.

$expr
~~~~~

The :query:`$expr` operator does not support multikey indexes.
