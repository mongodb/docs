Of the four basic database operations (i.e. CRUD), *delete* operations
are those that remove documents from a :term:`collection` in MongoDB.

For general information about write operations and the factors that affect
their performance, see :doc:`/core/write-operations`; for documentation
of other CRUD operations, see the :doc:`/crud` page.

.. _crud-delete-remove:

Overview
--------

The :ref:`remove() <crud-delete-remove>` method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell provides this operation, as do corresponding methods in the
:doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>`.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-write-concern.rst

Use the :method:`~db.collection.remove()` method to delete documents
from a collection. The :method:`~db.collection.remove()` method has
the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.remove( <query>, <justOne> )

.. admonition:: Corresponding operation in SQL

   The :method:`~db.collection.remove()` method is analogous to
   the ``DELETE`` statement, and:

   - the ``<query>`` argument corresponds to the ``WHERE`` statement, and

   - the ``<justOne>`` argument takes a Boolean and has the same
     effect as ``LIMIT 1``.

:method:`~db.collection.remove()` deletes documents from the
collection. If you do not specify a query,
:method:`~db.collection.remove()` removes all documents from a
collection, but does not remove the indexes. [#drop]_

.. note::

   For large deletion operations, it may be more efficient to copy the
   documents that you want to keep to a new collection and then use
   :method:`~db.collection.drop()` on the original collection.

Remove All Documents that Match a Condition
-------------------------------------------

If there is a ``<query>`` argument, the
:method:`~db.collection.remove()` method deletes from the collection
all documents that match the argument.

The following operation deletes all documents from the ``bios``
collection where the subdocument ``name`` contains a field ``first``
whose value starts with ``G``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.bios.remove( { 'name.first' : /^G/ } )

Remove a Single Document that Matches a Condition
-------------------------------------------------

If there is a ``<query>`` argument and you specify the ``<justOne>``
argument as ``true`` or ``1``, :method:`~db.collection.remove()` only
deletes a single document from the collection that matches the query.

The following operation deletes a single document from the ``bios``
collection where the ``turing`` field equals ``true``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.bios.remove( { turing: true }, 1 )

Remove All Documents from a Collection
--------------------------------------

If there is no ``<query>`` argument, the
:method:`~db.collection.remove()` method deletes all documents from a
collection. The following operation deletes all documents from the
``bios`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.bios.remove()

.. note::

   This operation is not equivalent to the
   :method:`~db.collection.drop()` method.

.. [#drop] To remove all documents from a collection, it may be more
   efficient to use the :method:`~db.collection.drop()` method
   to drop the entire collection, including the indexes, and then
   recreate the collection and rebuild the indexes.

.. _crud-delete-remove-isolation:

Capped Collection
-----------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-remove-capped-collection-restriction.rst

Isolation
---------

If the ``<query>`` argument to the :method:`~db.collection.remove()`
method matches multiple documents in the collection, the delete
operation may interleave with other write operations to that
collection. For an unsharded collection, you have the option to
override this behavior with the :update:`$isolated` isolation
operator, effectively isolating the delete operation from other write
operations. To isolate the operation, include ``$isolated: 1`` in the
``<query>`` parameter as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.bios.remove( { turing: true, $isolated: 1 } )
