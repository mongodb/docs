To write application code that takes full advantage of the always-on
capabilities of |service-fullname|, you should:

- Install the latest drivers.

- Use the connection string provided by |service|.

- Use retryable writes and retryable reads.

- Use a ``majority`` write concern and a read concern that makes sense
  for your application.

- Handle errors in your application.

Install the Latest Drivers
--------------------------

First, install the latest drivers for your language from
:driver:`MongoDB Drivers </>`. Drivers connect and relay
queries from your application to your database. Using the latest
drivers enables the latest MongoDB features.

Then, in your application, import the dependency:

.. tabs-drivers::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: nodejs

      .. code-block:: javascript

         // Latest 'mongodb' version installed with npm
         const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

   .. tab::
      :tabid: java-sync

      If you are using `Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`__, add the
      following to your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:

      .. code-block:: xml

         <dependencies>
             <dependency>
                 <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
                 <artifactId>mongodb-driver-sync</artifactId>
                 <version>4.0.1</version>
             </dependency>
         </dependencies>

      If you are using `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__, add the
      following to your ``build.gradle`` dependencies list:

      .. code-block:: groovy

         dependencies {
           compile 'org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-sync:4.0.1'
         }

Connection Strings
------------------

.. note::
   |service| provides a pre-configured connection string. For steps to
   copy the pre-configured string, see
   :ref:`Atlas-Provided Connection Strings <atlas-connection-string>`.

Use a :manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string>` that
specifies all the nodes in your |service| cluster to connect your
application to your database. If your cluster performs a
:manual:`replica set election </core/replica-set-elections/>` and a new
primary is elected, a connection string that specifies all the nodes in
your cluster discovers the new primary without application logic.

You can specify all the nodes in your cluster using either:

- the :manual:`Standard Connection String Format </reference/connection-string/#standard-connection-string-format>`, or

- the :manual:`DNS Seedlist Connection Format </reference/connection-string/#dns-seedlist-connection-format>`
  (recommended with |service|).

The connection string can also specify options, notably
:manual:`retryWrites </reference/connection-string/#urioption.retryWrites>`
and :manual:`writeConcern </reference/write-concern/#wc-w>`.

.. _atlas-connection-string:

Atlas-Provided Connection Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you copy your connection string from your |service| cluster
interface, the connection string is pre-configured for your cluster,
uses the DNS Seedlist format, and includes the recommended
``retryWrites`` and ``w`` (write concern) options.

To copy your connection string URI from |service|:

1. In |service-fullname|, under your project, select
   :guilabel:`Clusters` from the navigation panel.

#. Click :guilabel:`Connect` on the cluster you wish to connect your
   application to.

#. Select :guilabel:`Connect Your Application` as your connection
   method.

#. Select your :guilabel:`Driver` and :guilabel:`Version`.

#. Copy the connection string or full driver example into your
   application code. You must provide database user credentials.

   .. note::

      This guide uses
      :manual:`SCRAM authentication </core/security-scram/>` through a
      connection string. If you want to learn about using X.509
      certificates to authenticate, see
      :manual:`X.509 </core/security-x.509/>`.

Use your connection string to instantiate a MongoDB client in your
application:

.. tabs-drivers::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: nodejs

      .. code-block:: javascript

         // Copy the connection string provided by Atlas
         const uri = "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority";

         // Instantiate the MongoDB client with the URI
         const client = new MongoClient(uri, {
             useNewUrlParser: true,
             useUnifiedTopology: true
         });

   .. tab::
      :tabid: java-sync

      .. code-block:: java

       // Copy the connection string provided by Atlas
       String uri = "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>?retryWrites=true&w=majority";

       // Instantiate the MongoDB client with the URI
       MongoClient client = MongoClients.create(uri);

.. _retryable-writes:

Retryable Writes and Reads
--------------------------

.. note::

   Starting in MongoDB version 3.6 and with
   :driver:`4.2-compatible drivers </>`, MongoDB retries both writes
   and reads once by default.

Retryable Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use :manual:`retryable writes </core/retryable-writes>` to retry
certain write operations a single time if they fail. If you
copied your connection string from |service|, it includes
``"retryWrites=true"``. If you are providing your own connection string,
include ``"retryWrites=true"`` as a query parameter.

Retrying writes exactly once is the best strategy for handling
transient network errors and replica set elections in which the
application temporarily cannot find a healthy primary node. If the
retry succeeds, the operation as a whole succeeds and no error is
returned. If the operation fails, it is likely due to:

- A lasting network error, or

- An invalid command.

When an operation fails, your application needs to
:ref:`handle the error <error-handling>` itself.

Retryable Reads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read operations are automatically retried a single time if they fail
starting in MongoDB version 3.6 and with
:driver:`4.2-compatible drivers </>`.
No additional configuration is required to retry reads.

Write and Read Concern
----------------------

You can tune the consistency and availability of your application using
write concerns and read concerns. Stricter concerns imply that database
operations wait for stronger data consistency guarantees, whereas
loosening consistency requirements provides higher availability.

.. example::

   If your application handles monetary balances, consistency is
   extremely important. You might use ``majority`` write and read
   concerns to ensure you never read from stale data or data that may
   be rolled back.

   Alternatively, if your application records temperature data from
   hundreds of sensors every second, you may not be concerned if you
   read data that does not include the most recent readouts. You can
   loosen consistency requirements and provide faster access to that
   data.

Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set the
:manual:`write concern level </reference/write-concern/>`
of your |service| replica set through the connection string URI. Use a
``majority`` write concern to ensure your data is successfully written
to your database and persisted. This is the recommended default and
sufficient for most use cases. If you copied your connection string
from |service|, it includes ``"w=majority"``.

When you use a write concern that requires acknowledgement, such as
``majority``, you may also specify a maximum time limit for writes
to achieve that level of acknowledgement:

- The :manual:`wtimeoutMS </reference/connection-string/#urioption.wtimeoutMS>` connection string parameter for all writes, or

- The :manual:`wtimeout </reference/write-concern/#wtimeout>` option
  for a single write operation.

Whether or not you use a time limit and the value you use depend on
your application context.

.. important::

   If you do not specify a time limit for writes and the level of write
   concern is unachievable, the write operation will hang indefinitely.

Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set the
:manual:`read concern level </reference/connection-string/#readconcern-options>`
of your |service| replica set through the connection string URI. The
ideal :manual:`read concern </reference/read-concern/>` depends on
your application requirements, but the default is sufficient for most
use cases. No connection string parameter is required to use default
read concerns.

Specifying a read concern can improve guarantees around the data your
application receives from |service|.

.. note::
   The specific combination of write and read concern your application
   uses has an effect on order-of-operation guarantees. This is called
   causal consistency. For more information on causal consistency
   guarantees, see :manual:`Causal Consistency and Read and Write Concerns </core/causal-consistency-read-write-concerns/>`.

.. _error-handling:

Error Handling
--------------

Invalid commands, network outages, and network errors that are not
handled by :ref:`retryable writes <retryable-writes>` return errors.
Refer to your driver's |api| documentation for error details.

For example, if an application tries to insert a document with a
duplicate ``_id``, your driver returns an error that includes:

.. tabs-drivers::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: nodejs

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false

         {
             "name": : "MongoError",
             "message": "E11000 duplicate key error collection on: <db>.<collection> ... ",
             ...
         }

   .. tab::
      :tabid: java-sync

      .. code-block:: none

         Unable to insert due to an error: com.mongodb.MongoWriteException:
         E11000 duplicate key error collection: <db>.<collection> ...

Without proper error handling, an error may block your application from
processing requests until it is restarted.

Your application should handle errors without crashing or side
effects. In the previous example of an application inserting a
duplicate ``_id``, that application could handle errors as follows:

.. tabs-drivers::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: nodejs

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :emphasize-lines: 9-11

         ...
         collection.insertOne({
             _id: 1,
             body: "I'm a goofball trying to insert a duplicate _id"
         })
         .then(result => {
             response.sendStatus(200) // send "OK" message to the client
         },
         err => {
             response.sendStatus(400); // send "Bad Request" message to the client
         });

   .. tab::
      :tabid: java-sync

      .. code-block:: java

         // Declare a logger instance from java.util.logging.Logger
         private static final Logger LOGGER = ...
         ...
         try {
             InsertOneResult result = collection.insertOne(new Document()
                 .append("_id", 1)
                 .append("body", "I'm a goofball trying to insert a duplicate _id"));

             // Everything is OK
             LOGGER.info("Inserted document id: " + result.getInsertedId());

         // Refer to the API documentation for specific exceptions to catch
         } catch (MongoException me) {
             // Report the error
             LOGGER.severe("Failed due to an error: " + me);
         }

The insert operation in this example throws a "duplicate key"
error the second time it's invoked because the ``_id`` field must be
unique. The error is caught, the client is notified, and the app
continues to run. The insert operation fails, however, and it is
up to you to decide whether to show the user a message, retry the
operation, or do something else.

You should always log errors. Common strategies for further processing
errors include:

- Return the error to the client with an error message. This is a good
  strategy when you cannot resolve the error and need to inform a user
  that an action cannot be completed.

- Write to a backup database. This is a good strategy when you cannot
  resolve the error but don't want to risk losing the request data.

- Retry the operation beyond the
  :ref:`single default retry <retryable-writes>`. This is a good
  strategy when you can solve the cause of an error programmatically,
  then retry it.

You must select the best strategies for your application context.

.. example::

   In the example of a duplicate key error, you should log the error
   but not retry the operation because it will never succeed. Instead,
   you could write to a fallback database and review the contents of
   that database at a later time to ensure that no information is lost.
   The user doesn't need to do anything else and the data is recorded,
   so you can choose not to send an error message to the client.

Planning for Network Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returning an error can be desirable behavior when an operation
would otherwise hang indefinitely and block your application from
executing new operations. You can use the
:manual:`maxTimeMS </tutorial/terminate-running-operations/#maxtimems>`
method to place a time limit on individual operations, returning an
error for your application to handle if that time limit is exceeded.

The time limit you place on each operation depends on the context of
that operation.

.. example::

   If your application reads and displays simple product information
   from an ``inventory`` collection, you can be reasonably confident
   that those read operations only take a moment. An unusually
   long-running query is a good indicator that there is a lasting
   network problem. Setting ``maxTimeMS`` on that operation to 5000, or
   5 seconds, means that your application receives feedback as soon as
   you are confident there is a network problem.

Test Failover
-------------

In the spirit of
`chaos testing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering>`__,
|service| will perform replica
set elections automatically for periodic maintenance and certain
configuration changes.

To check if your application is resilient to replica set elections,
:doc:`test the failover process </tutorial/test-failover/>` by
simulating a failover event.

Resilient Example Application
-----------------------------

The following example application brings together the recommendations
for building resilient applications.

The application is a simple user records
|api| that exposes two endpoints on http://localhost:3000:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Endpoint
     - Description

   * - ``GET``
     - ``/users``
     - Gets a list of user names from a ``users`` collection.

   * - ``POST``
     -  ``/users``
     - Requires a ``name`` in the request body. Adds a new user to a
       ``users`` collection.

      .. note::
         The following server application uses
         `Express <https://github.com/expressjs/express>`__,
         which you need to add to your project as a dependency
         before you can run it.

      .. code-block:: javascript
