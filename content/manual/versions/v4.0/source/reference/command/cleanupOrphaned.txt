.. dbcommand:: cleanupOrphaned

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   Deletes from a shard the :term:`orphaned documents <orphaned
   document>` whose shard key values fall into a single or a single
   contiguous range that do not belong to the shard. For example, if
   two contiguous ranges do not belong to the shard, the
   :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` examines both ranges for orphaned
   documents.

   To run, issue :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` in the ``admin`` database
   directly on the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that is the primary
   replica set member of the shard. You do not need to disable the
   balancer before running :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned`.

   .. note::

      Do not run :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` on a
      :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

   :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( {
         cleanupOrphaned: "<database>.<collection>",
         startingFromKey: <minimumShardKeyValue>,
         secondaryThrottle: <boolean>,
         writeConcern: <document>
      } )

   :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` has the following fields:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``cleanupOrphaned``
   
        - string
   
        - The namespace, i.e. both the database and the collection name, of the
          sharded collection for which to clean the orphaned data.
          
          
   
      * - ``startingFromKey``
   
        - document
   
        - Optional. The :term:`shard key` value that determines the lower bound of the
          cleanup range. The default value is ``MinKey``.
          
          If the range that contains the specified ``startingFromKey`` value
          belongs to a chunk owned by the shard, :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned`
          continues to examine the next ranges until it finds a range not owned
          by the shard. See :ref:`cleanupOrphaned-determine-range` for details.
          
          
   
      * - ``secondaryThrottle``
   
        - boolean
   
        - Optional. If ``true``, each delete operation must be replicated to another
          secondary before the cleanup operation proceeds further. If
          ``false``, do not wait for replication. Defaults to ``false``.
          
          Independent of the ``secondaryThrottle`` setting, after the final
          delete, :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` waits for all deletes to
          replicate to a majority of replica set members before returning.
          
          
   
      * - ``writeConcern``
   
        - document
   
        - Optional. A document that expresses the :doc:`write concern
          </reference/write-concern>` that the ``secondaryThrottle`` will use to
          wait for the secondaries when removing orphaned data.
          
          ``writeConcern`` requires ``secondaryThrottle: true``.
          
          
   


Behavior
--------

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` scans the documents in the shard to
determine whether the documents belong to the shard. As such, running
:dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` can impact performance; however,
performance will depend on the number of orphaned documents in the
range.

To remove all orphaned documents in a shard, you can run the command in
a loop (see :ref:`cleanupOrphaned-example-all-orphaned` for an
example). If concerned about the performance impact of this operation,
you may prefer to include a pause in-between iterations.

Alternatively, to mitigate the impact of :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned`,
you may prefer to run the command at off peak hours.

.. _cleanupOrphaned-determine-range:

Determine Range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command uses the ``startingFromKey``
value, if specified, to determine the start of the range to examine for
orphaned document:

- If the ``startingFromKey`` value falls into a range for a chunk not
  owned by the shard, :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` begins examining at
  the start of this range, which may not necessarily be the
  ``startingFromKey``.

- If the ``startingFromKey`` value falls into a range for a chunk owned
  by the shard, :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` moves onto the next range
  until it finds a range for a chunk not owned by the shard.

The :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` deletes orphaned documents from the
start of the determined range and ends at the start of the chunk range
that belongs to the shard.

Consider the following key space with documents distributed across
``Shard A`` and ``Shard B``.

.. include:: /images/sharding-cleanup-orphaned.rst

``Shard A`` owns:

- ``Chunk 1`` with the range ``{ x: minKey } --> { x: -75 }``,

- ``Chunk 2`` with the range ``{ x: -75 } --> { x: 25 }``, and

- ``Chunk 4`` with the range ``{ x: 175 } --> { x: 200 }``.

``Shard B`` owns:

- ``Chunk 3`` with the range ``{ x: 25 } --> { x: 175 }`` and

- ``Chunk 5`` with the range ``{ x: 200 } --> { x: maxKey }``.

If on ``Shard A``, the :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command runs with
``startingFromKey: { x: -70 }`` or any other value belonging to range for
``Chunk 1`` or ``Chunk 2``, the :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command examines
the ``Chunk 3`` range of ``{ x: 25 } --> { x: 175 }`` to delete
orphaned data.

If on ``Shard B``, the :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command runs with
the ``startingFromKey: { x: -70 }`` or any other value belonging to range
for ``Chunk 1``, the :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command examines the
combined contiguous range for ``Chunk 1`` and ``Chunk 2``, namely ``{
x: minKey } --> { x: 25 }`` to delete orphaned data.

Required Access
---------------

On systems running with :setting:`~security.authorization`, you must have
:authrole:`clusterAdmin` privileges to run :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned`.

.. _cleanupOrphaned-output:

Output
------

Return Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command returns a document containing
a subset of the following fields:

.. data:: cleanupOrphaned.ok

   Equal to ``1`` on success.

   A value of ``1`` indicates that :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` scanned
   the specified shard key range, deleted any orphaned documents
   found in that range, and confirmed that all deletes replicated to a
   majority of the members of that shard's replica set. If confirmation
   does not arrive within 1 hour, :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned`
   times out.

   A value of ``0`` could indicate either of two cases:

   - :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` found orphaned documents on the
     shard but could not delete them.

   - :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` found and deleted orphaned
     documents, but could not confirm replication before the 1
     hour timeout. In this case, replication does occur but only
     after :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` returns.

.. data:: cleanupOrphaned.stoppedAtKey

   The upper bound of the cleanup range of shard keys. If present, the
   value corresponds to the lower bound of the next chunk on the shard.
   The absence of the field signifies that the cleanup range was the
   uppermost range for the shard.

.. _cleanuporphaned-examples:

Examples
--------

The following examples run the :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command
directly on the primary of the shard.

Remove Orphaned Documents for a Specific Range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a sharded collection ``info`` in the ``test`` database, a shard
owns a single chunk with the range: ``{ x: MinKey } --> { x: 10 }``.

The shard also contains documents whose shard keys values fall in a
range for a chunk *not* owned by the shard: ``{ x: 10 } --> { x: MaxKey
}``.

To remove orphaned documents within the ``{ x: 10 } => { x: MaxKey }``
range, you can specify a ``startingFromKey`` with a value that falls into
this range, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( {
      "cleanupOrphaned": "test.info",
      "startingFromKey": { x: 10 },
      "secondaryThrottle": true
   } )

Or you can specify a ``startingFromKey`` with a value that falls into the
previous range, as in the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( {
      "cleanupOrphaned": "test.info",
      "startingFromKey": { x: 2 },
      "secondaryThrottle": true
   } )

Since ``{ x: 2 }`` falls into a range that belongs to a chunk owned by
the shard, :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` examines the next range to find
a range not owned by the shard, in this case ``{ x: 10 } => { x: MaxKey
}``.

.. _cleanupOrphaned-example-all-orphaned:

Remove All Orphaned Documents from a Shard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` examines documents from a single
contiguous range of shard keys. To remove all orphaned documents from
the shard, you can run :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` in a loop, using
the returned ``stoppedAtKey`` as the next ``startingFromKey``, as in
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var nextKey = { };
   var result;

   while ( nextKey != null ) {
     result = db.adminCommand( { cleanupOrphaned: "test.user", startingFromKey: nextKey } );

     if (result.ok != 1)
        print("Unable to complete at this time: failure or timeout.")

     printjson(result);

     nextKey = result.stoppedAtKey;
   }
