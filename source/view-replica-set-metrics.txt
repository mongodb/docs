A :manual:`replica set </replication>` in MongoDB is a group of 
:binary:`~bin.mongod` processes that maintain the same data set. To 
view the metrics for a specific |service| cluster in the Clusters view 
of a :ref:`project <projects>`, click the :guilabel:`Metrics` button 
for that cluster. Alternatively, click on the name of the cluster to 
open the cluster overview, then click the :guilabel:`Metrics` tab. You can look at your replica set holistically, or hone in on a specific node.

The :guilabel:`Metrics` view has three distinct sections:

Chart Controls
--------------
       
|service| provides the following controls for the :guilabel:`Metric` 
view. Adjusting any of these options affects all charts displayed under 
the :guilabel:`Metrics` view:
       
.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 65
   :header-rows: 1
       
   * - Control
     - Function
        
   * - :guilabel:`Granularity`

     - Modifies the granularity of metrics displayed for each chart.
       Select a granularity between 1 minute and 1 day (24 hours).
       Select ``Auto`` to automatically adjust the granularity based 
       on the selected :guilabel:`Zoom` or :guilabel:`Current Display`
       date controls. ``Auto`` granularity selects the highest fidelity
       granularity available for the time range.
        
   * - :guilabel:`Zoom`

     - Modifies the date range of metrics displayed for each chart. 
       Select a zoom range between 1 hour and 5 years. Adjusting
       the :guilabel:`Zoom` automatically adjusts the
       :guilabel:`Current Display` date range. 
        
   * - :guilabel:`Current Display`

     - Modifies the start and end date-time range of metrics displayed 
       for each chart. Modifying the start and end date sets the 
       value of :guilabel:`Zoom` to ``custom`` and overrides the
       previously selected zoom level.
        
   * - :guilabel:`Toggle Members`

     - Limit charts to the selected replica set members. The
       ``P`` icon represents the :term:`Primary` replica set member,
       while the ``S`` icon represents a :term:`Secondary`
       member.
        
   * - :guilabel:`Add Chart`

     - Select one or more charts to display or hide. Adding
       charts using this dropdown is identical to adding charts
       from the :guilabel:`Toggle Charts` section of the 
       :guilabel:`Metrics` view.
  
   * - :guilabel:`Display Opcounters on Separate Charts`

     - Directs |service| to split the :guilabel:`Opcounters`
       chart into its individual components. You can then choose
       to chart one or more of those components.
        
   * - :guilabel:`Display Timeline Annotations`
  
     - Directs |service| to display or hide chart annotations. 
       Chart annotations consist of colored vertical lines that 
       indicate server events, such as a server restart or 
       a transition in member state.
       
Chart Display
-------------
      
When viewing charts, you can do the following:
      
.. include:: /includes/list-tables/monitor-chart-controls.rst
       
Chart Selection
---------------
       
|service| displays the available metrics to chart for the
selected cluster under the :guilabel:`Toggle Charts` header. 
Metrics are grouped into two sections:
       
:guilabel:`MongoDB Metrics`
   Metrics associated with the MongoDB process. For metrics 
   related to database performance, such as 
   :guilabel:`DB Storage`, |service| presents the sum total across
   all databases in the cluster. 
       
   If you enable 
   :guilabel:`Display Opcounters on Separate Charts`, 
   |service| replaces the :guilabel:`Opcounters` option with the
   individual components of that chart. 
       
:guilabel:`Hardware Metrics`
   Metrics associated with the host machines supporting the cluster. 
       
   Charts marked with the ``+`` symbol are inactive, 
   while charts marked with the ``-`` symbol are active. Click
   on any chart to toggle the chart state.
