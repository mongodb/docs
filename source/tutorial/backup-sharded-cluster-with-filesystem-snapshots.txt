Overview
--------

This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all
components of a :term:`sharded cluster`. This procedure uses file system
snapshots to capture a copy of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

For more information on backups in MongoDB and backups of sharded
clusters in particular, see :doc:`/core/backups` and
:doc:`/administration/backup-sharded-clusters`.

Considerations

Encrypted Storage Engine (MongoDB Enterprise Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Balancer
~~~~~~~~

It is *essential* that you stop the :ref:`balancer
<sharding-internals-balancing>` before capturing a backup.

If the balancer is active while you capture backups, the backup
artifacts may be incomplete and/or have duplicate data, as :term:`chunks
<chunk>` may migrate while recording backups.

Precision
~~~~~~~~~

In this procedure, you will stop the cluster balancer and take a backup
up of the :term:`config database`, and then take backups of each
shard in the cluster using a file-system snapshot tool. If you need an
exact moment-in-time snapshot of the system, you will need to stop all
application writes before taking the file system snapshots; otherwise
the snapshot will only approximate a moment in time.

For approximate point-in-time snapshots, you can minimize the impact on
the cluster by taking the backup from a secondary member of each
replica set shard.

Consistency
~~~~~~~~~~~

If the journal and data files are on the same logical volume, you can
use a single point-in-time snapshot to capture a consistent copy of the
data files.

If the journal and data files are on different file systems, you must
use :method:`db.fsyncLock()` and :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` to ensure
that the data files do not change, providing consistency for the
purposes of creating backups.
