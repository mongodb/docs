   Documents in a sharded collection can be
   :ref:`missing the shard key fields <shard-key-missing>`. To target a
   document that is missing the shard key, you can use the ``null``
   equality match :red:`in conjunction with` another filter condition
   (such as on the ``_id`` field). For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { _id: <value>, <shardkeyfield>: null } // _id of the document missing shard key

   Since a missing key value is returned as part of a null equality
   match, to avoid updating a null-valued key, include additional
   query conditions (such as on the ``_id`` field) as appropriate.
