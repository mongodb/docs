The :guilabel:`Validation` tab allows you to manage
:manual:`schema validation rules </core/document-validation>`
for a collection.

Schema validation ensures that all documents in a
collection follow a defined set of rules, such as conforming to a
specific shape or only allowing a specified range of values in fields.

For details, see :ref:`<compass-validation>`.
