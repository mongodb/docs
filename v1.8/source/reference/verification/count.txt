The most basic method of verification is to compare the number of documents
in each synced collection on the source cluster to the number on the
destination cluster.

This method only verifies a successful sync when run against clusters with
insert-only workloads. If you do not have an insert-only workload for the
cluster, use a different :ref:`verification method <c2c-verify-method>`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Count Source Documents

      Run the :method:`~db.collection.countDocuments` method on each synced
      collection on the source cluster:

      .. io-code-block::

         .. input::
            :language: javascript

            db.us_accounts.countDocuments()

         .. output::
            :language: javascript

            345

      Note the number of documents.

   .. step:: Count Destination Documents

      Run the :method:`~db.collection.countDocuments` method on each synced
      collection on the destination cluster:

      .. io-code-block::

         .. input::
            :language: javascript

            db.us_accounts.countDocuments()

         .. output::
            :language: javascript

            345

      Note the number of documents.

   .. step:: Compare Counts

      Compare the results of each document count:

      - If the document count is different, not all changes synced to the
        destination cluster.

      - If the document count is the same *and* your cluster has an insert-only
        workload, the sync was successful.

      - If your source cluster does *not* have an insert-only workload, use a
        different method to verify sync.
