Overview
--------

:manual:`Indexes </indexes>` support the efficient execution of queries 
in MongoDB. However, each index you create has a negative performance 
impact on writes and requires some disk space.

Creating unnecessary indexes leads to a bloated collection and slow 
writes. Consider each query your application performs and whether it 
justifies an index. Remove indexes that are unused, either because the 
field is not used to query the database or because the index is 
redundant.

You should 
:ref:`identify and drop unnecessary indexes <identify-unnecessary-indexes>`. 
Use the :doc:`Data Explorer </data-explorer/indexes/>` to manage 
indexes in |service|.

Example
-------

Consider a game that awards ``coins`` to players. When a player reaches 
20 ``coins``, that player earns 1 ``star`` and their ``coins`` are 
reset to 0. The game has a ``players`` collection with documents such 
as the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // players collection
   {
     "_id": "ObjectId(123)",
     "first_name": "John",
     "last_name": "Doe",
     "coins": 11,
     "stars": 2
   }

The ``players`` collection has an index for every field:

- ``_id`` is indexed by default.
- ``{ last_name: 1 }``
- ``{ last_name: 1, first_name: 1 }``
- ``{ coins: -1 }``
- ``{ stars: -1 }``

``last_name`` Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, when the game queries the database for player 
information, it finds a single record using a player's full name. The 
:manual:`compound index </core/index-compound/>` ``{ last_name: 1, 
first_name: 1 }`` covers this case, so the game should drop the index 
``{ last_name: 1 }`` because it is redundant.

``coins`` Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, the ``coins`` field is never used to search the 
database. The game should drop the index ``{ coins: -1 }`` because it 
is unused.

``stars`` Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, at the end of a game, the players' names are displayed 
on a leaderboard in descending order by number of stars. The game 
should maintain the index ``{ stars: -1 }``, even if it is used
infrequently, to avoid scanning every document in the 
``players`` collection.

Now, the game uses the following indexes:

- ``_id`` is indexed by default.
- ``{ last_name: 1, first_name: 1 }``
- ``{ stars: -1 }``

After dropping unnecessary indexes, the ``players`` collection has 
more free space and can perform faster writes. The most frequent reads 
do not experience a drop in performance because the indexes supporting 
those reads still exist in the collection.

.. _identify-unnecessary-indexes:

Identify & Drop Unnecessary Indexes
-----------------------------------

To identify unnecessary indexes in |service|, 
:ref:`View Indexes with Data Explorer <de-view-indexes>`.

Under the :guilabel:`Indexes` tab in Data Explorer, you can view 
:guilabel:`Size`, :guilabel:`Usage`, and other information for each of 
your indexes. If an index is unused or covered by another index, you 
should drop it.

To drop an index in |service|, 
:ref:`Drop an Index with Data Explorer <de-drop-an-index>`.
