       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`Custom Role Name`

       - Name of your custom role.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-custom-role-name-restrictions.rst

     * - :guilabel:`Action or Role`

       - Privileges granted by the role. Click the dropdown to view the
         list of available
         :manual:`privilege actions </reference/privilege-actions/>`
         and :manual:`roles </reference/built-in-roles/>`.

         |service| groups the actions and roles into the following
         categories:

         - ``Collection Actions``,
         - ``Database Actions and Roles``,
         - ``Global Actions and Roles``,
         - ``Custom Roles`` (if any)

         Select the action or role from a single category. Once you
         select an action or role, |service| disables the other categories
         with the following exception. If you select an action/role
         from the :guilabel:`Global Actions and Roles`, you can still
         select actions/roles from :guilabel:`Custom Roles`.

         To grant actions and roles from a different category, click
         :guilabel:`Add an action or role` to add a new row.

         are granted, if applicable.

         This field is required for all roles and actions under the
         :guilabel:`Collection Actions` and
         :guilabel:`Database Actions and Roles` categories.

     * - :guilabel:`Collection`

       - Collection within the specified database on which
         the actions and roles are granted, if applicable.

         This field is required for all roles and actions under

  To grant the same set of privileges on multiple databases and
  collections, click :guilabel:`Add a database or collection`.
