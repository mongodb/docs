title: "Select :guilabel:`Connect Your Application`."

ref: connect-details
content: |

  In the :guilabel:`Choose a connection method` step, select
  :guilabel:`Connect Your Application`.

  The :guilabel:`Connect` dialog displays the
  :manual:`URI connection string </reference/connection-string/>` for
  connecting to the |service| cluster with a MongoDB driver. Select
  the appropriate connection string based on the latest MongoDB
  version your driver supports. For example, if your driver supports
  MongoDB 3.6 or later, select
  :guilabel:`SRV Connection String (3.6+ Driver)`. For details on
  driver compatibility with MongoDB, see `Driver Compatibility
  <https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/driver-compatibility-reference/>`_.

  The URI connection string uses a MongoDB user set up for
  the project as the user to authenticate as. Update the ``<PASSWORD>``
  placeholder with the password for this user.

  .. important::

     If the password contains reserved URI characters, you must escape
     the characters per `RFC 2396
     <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt>`_. For example, if your
     password is ``@bc123``, you must escape the ``@`` character when
     specifying the password in the connection string; i.e. ``%40bc123``.

  To connect with a different MongoDB user, update the ``USERNAME`` and
  ``PASSWORD`` components of the URI connection string with the username and
  password of a different MongoDB user.

  .. code-block:: shell

     mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@...

  You must also replace the ``<DATABASE>`` placeholder in the URI connection
  string with the database you want your application to connect to.
