   Starting in MongoDB 3.6.6, if you specify
   ``--sslAllowInvalidCertificates`` or ``ssl.allowInvalidCertificates:
   true`` when using x.509 authentication, an invalid certificate is
   only sufficient to establish a TLS/SSL connection but is
   *insufficient* for authentication.

   Starting in version 3.4, if ``--sslCAFile`` or ``ssl.CAFile`` is not
   specified and you are not using x.509 authentication, the
   system-wide CA certificate store will be used when connecting to an
   TLS/SSL-enabled server.

   If using x.509 authentication, ``--sslCAFile`` or ``ssl.CAFile``
   must be specified.

   Starting in version 3.2.6, if ``--sslCAFile`` or ``ssl.CAFile`` is
   not specified, the system-wide CA certificate store will be used
   when connecting to an TLS/SSL-enabled server. In previous versions
   of MongoDB, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell exited with an error that
   it could not validate the certificate.

   .. warning::
      
      For TLS/SSL connections to :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
      :binary:`~bin.mongos`, avoid using
      ``--sslAllowInvalidCertificates`` if possible and only use
      ``--sslAllowInvalidCertificates`` on systems where intrusion is
      not possible.

      If the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell (and other
      :ref:`mongodb-tools-support-ssl`) runs with the
      ``--sslAllowInvalidCertificates`` option, the
      :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell (and other
      :ref:`mongodb-tools-support-ssl`) will not attempt to validate
      the server certificates. This creates a vulnerability to expired
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` certificates as
      well as to foreign processes posing as valid
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

   To connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` that
   uses TLS/SSL, you must also specify the ``--host`` option for the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell if you haven't specified a connect
   string. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell verifies that the hostname of
   the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` matches the CN or
   SAN of ``--sslPEMKeyFile`` certificate presented by the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`. If the hostname does
   not match the CN/SAN, :binary:`~bin.mongo` will fail to connect.
