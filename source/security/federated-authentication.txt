To link your |idp| to |mms| you provide each with the appropriate
metadata. Once you have linked your |idp| to |mms|, map domains and
organizations to your |idp|:

Domain Mapping
  If you or another user log in to |mms| using one of these mapped
  domains, |mms| redirects you to the associated |idp|. After you
  authenticate with the IdP, it returns you to the |mms|
  application. To learn more about Domain Mapping, see
  :ref:`mms-manage-fed-domain-map`.

Organization Mapping
  Users who log in through the |idp| are granted access to the mapped
  |mms| organizations. You can choose what
  :ref:`role <organization-roles>` these users have within the
  selected organizations. To learn more about Organization Mapping, see
  :ref:`mms-manage-fed-org-map`.

Federation Management Access
----------------------------

Tutorials
---------

To configure federated authentication in |mms|, you must:

1. :ref:`Link an Identity Provider to Cloud Manager
   <mms-manage-fed-auth>` to ensure that your users are authenticated
   through your trusted |idp|.

#. :ref:`Map Domains to your Identity Provider 
   <mms-manage-fed-domain-map>` to streamline the login experience
   for users from specified domains by authenticating them through an
   |idp|.

Once you set up your |idp|, you can optionally
:ref:`Map Organizations to your Identity Provider
<mms-manage-fed-org-map>` to give your users a unified login
experience.

.. _fed-auth-2fa:

Consideration for Two-Factor Authentication
-------------------------------------------

When you configure federated authentication and users authenticate
through your |idp|, |mms| |2fa| for those users is bypassed. If a
user authenticates through your |idp| and has |2fa| for their |mms|
account enabled, |mms| does not prompt the user for |2fa|. Instead,
you can configure your trusted |idp| to prompt users for |2fa|.
