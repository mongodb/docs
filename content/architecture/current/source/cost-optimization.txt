===============================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

features that help you control database costs in |service-fullname|.




Use the following {+atlas-arch-center+} resources to learn about cost
optimization in {+service+}:

      :url: https://mongodb.com/docs/atlas/architecture/cost-saving-config/
      :icon: atlas_usage_based_pricing
      :icon-alt: Atlas usage-based pricing icon

      Get recommendations to save costs, such as enabling auto-scaling on
      your cluster tier so that |service| automatically adjusts resources
      based on usage and prevents over-provisioning.

      :url: https://mongodb.com/docs/atlas/architecture/billing-data/

      Leverage tags and access billing data programmatically to track your 
      |service| spending in your FinOps tool by environment, team, and more.
