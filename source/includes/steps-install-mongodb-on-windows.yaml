  There are three builds of MongoDB for Windows:

  **MongoDB for Windows Server 2008 R2 edition** (i.e. 2008R2) runs only
  on Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7 64-bit, and newer versions of
  Windows. This build takes advantage of recent enhancements to the
  Windows Platform and cannot operate on older versions of Windows.

  **MongoDB for Windows 64-bit** runs on any 64-bit version of Windows
  newer than Windows XP, including Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7
  64-bit.

  **MongoDB for Windows 32-bit** runs on any 32-bit version of Windows
  newer than Windows XP. 32-bit versions of MongoDB are only intended for
  older systems and for use in testing and development systems. 32-bit
  versions of MongoDB only support databases smaller than 2GB.
