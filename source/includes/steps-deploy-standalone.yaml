  Enter information as required and click :guilabel:`Apply`. 

  The :guilabel:`Auth Schema Version` field determines the schema for
  storing user data. MongoDB 3.0 uses a different schema for user data
  than previous versions. For compatibility information, see the
  :manual:`MongoDB Release Notes <release-notes>`.

  New in MongoDB 3.0:
     You can choose which storage engine to use by adding the
     :guilabel:`engine` option in :guilabel:`Advanced Options`. For
     information on storage engines, see :manual:`Storage
     </core/storage>` in the MongoDB manual.

  New in MongoDB 3.4:
     You can choose an in-memory storage engine for a standalone
     deployment by adding the :guilabel:`engine` option and setting it to
     ``inMemory`` in :guilabel:`Advanced Options`. For more information,
     see :manual:`In-Memory Storage Engine </core/inmemory>` in the
     MongoDB manual.

     .. important::
        If you run a deployment with an in-memory storage engine and the
        server running that deployment fails or is shutdown, all data in
        any databases running that storage engine is lost.

  For descriptions of :guilabel:`Advanced Options`, see 
  :doc:`/reference/deployment-advanced-options`.
