GitHub manages your |2fa|. You can't use |service| multi-factor
authentication and won't be prompted for |a-service| |2fa| verification
when you log into |service|. GitHub should verify your identity using
`GitHub 2-Step Verification <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa>`__.
