  - If you are using :guilabel:`Windows` or :guilabel:`Linux`, you can
    choose to either download the shell directly, or fetch the shell
    via URL. For Linux, the type of file you download depends on the operating system you selected. If you select a version of:

    - **Ubuntu or Debian** you receive a ``.deb`` package.
    - **RHEL, Amazon Linux, or SUSE** you receive an ``.rpm`` package.

    If your operating system isn't listed, see the :mongosh:`.tgz 
    installation instructions </install>` in the {+mongosh+} 
    documentation. 

  - If you are using :guilabel:`macOS`, you can use the provided
    Homebrew command to download or go to the `MongoDB Shell 
    page <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell>`__ to download 
    {+mongosh+}.
