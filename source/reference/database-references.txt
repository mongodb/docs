For many use cases in MongoDB, the denormalized data model where
related data is stored within a single :term:`document <document>` is optimal. 
However, in some cases, it makes sense to store related
information in separate documents, typically in different collections
or databases.

.. important::

   You can use the :pipeline:`$lookup` pipeline stage to perform
   a left outer join to an unsharded collection in the same database.

   You can also use the :pipeline:`$graphLookup` pipeline stage to join an 
   unsharded collection to perform recursive search.

This page outlines alternative procedures that predate the
:pipeline:`$lookup` and :pipeline:`$graphLookup` pipeline stages.

You can create a database reference for deployments hosted in the
following environments:

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments.rst

MongoDB applications use one of two methods to relate documents:

- :ref:`Manual references <document-references>` save the
  ``_id`` field of one document in another document as a reference.
  Your application runs a second query to return the related
  data. These references are simple and sufficient for most use
  cases.

- :ref:`DBRefs <dbref-explanation>` are references from one document to another
  using the value of the first document's ``_id`` field, collection name,
  and, optionally, its database name, as well as any other fields. DBRefs allow
  you to more easily reference documents stored in multiple collections or 
  databases.

To resolve DBRefs, your application must perform additional queries to return
the referenced documents. Some :driver:`MongoDB drivers </>` provide helper 
methods to enable DBRefs to be resolved into documents, but it doesn't happen 
automatically.

DBRefs provide a common format and type to represent relationships among
documents. The DBRef format also provides common semantics for representing
links between documents if your database must interact with
multiple frameworks and tools.

Unless you have a compelling reason to use DBRefs, use manual
references instead.

.. _document-references:

Manual References
-----------------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

A manual reference is the practice of including one
:term:`document's <document>` ``_id`` field in another document. The
application can then issue a second query to resolve the referenced
fields as needed.

Create a Manual Reference in the {+atlas+} UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a manual reference in the {+atlas+} UI, follow these steps:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Navigate to the collection.

      a. In the {+atlas+} UI, click :guilabel:`Database` in the sidebar.
      #. For the database deployment where you want to add a database
         reference, click :guilabel:`Browse Collections`.
      #. In the left navigation pane, select the database.
      #. In the left navigation pane, select the collection. This
         example references a ``places`` collection.

   .. step:: Add a document.

      a. Click :guilabel:`Insert Document`.
      #. Click the JSON view icon (:guilabel:`{{}}`).
      #. Paste the following data into the document:

         .. code-block::

            {
              "_id": {
                "$oid": "651aea5870299b120736f442"
              },
              "name": "Broadway Center",
              "url": "bc.example.net"
            }

      #. Click :guilabel:`Insert`.

   .. step:: Add a document in the ``people`` collection that references the entry in ``places``.

      a. In the left navigation pane, select a different
         collection. This example references a ``people`` collection.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Insert Document`.
      #. Click the JSON view icon (:guilabel:`{{}}`).
      #. Paste the following data into the document:

         .. code-block::

            {
              "_id": {
                "$oid": "651aebeb70299b120736f443"
              },
              "name": "Erin",
              "places_id": "651aea5870299b120736f442"
              "url": "bc.example.net/Erin"
            }

      #. Click :guilabel:`Insert`.

         When a query returns the document from the ``people``
         collection you can, if needed, filter the query results from
         the ``places`` collection for the document referenced by the
         ``places_id`` field.

         To learn more about running queries in {+atlas+},
         see :atlas:`View, Filter, and Sort Documents 
         </atlas-ui/documents/#view--filter--and-sort-documents>` in
         the {+atlas+} documentation.


Create a Manual Reference in the Terminal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following operation to insert two documents, using the
``_id`` field of the first document as a reference in the second
document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   original_id = ObjectId()

   db.places.insertOne({
       "_id": original_id,
       "name": "Broadway Center",
       "url": "bc.example.net"
   })

   db.people.insertOne({
       "name": "Erin",
       "places_id": original_id,
       "url":  "bc.example.net/Erin"
   })

Then, when a query returns the document from the ``people`` collection
you can, if needed, make a second query for the document referenced by
the ``places_id`` field in the ``places`` collection.

Use
~~~

For nearly every case where you want to store a relationship between
two documents, use :ref:`manual references <document-references>`. The
references are simple to create and your application can resolve
references as needed.

The only limitation of manual linking is that these references do not
convey the database and collection names. If you have documents in a
single collection that relate to documents in more than one
collection, you may need to consider using DBRefs.

.. _dbref-explanation:

DBRefs
------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

DBRefs are a convention for representing a :term:`document`, rather
than a specific reference type. They include the name of the
collection, and in some cases the database name, in addition to the
value from the ``_id`` field. 

Optionally, DBRefs can include any number of other fields. Extra field names 
must follow any :ref:`rules for field names <limit-restrictions-on-field-names>` 
imposed by the server version.

Format
~~~~~~

DBRefs have the following fields:

.. describe:: $ref

   The ``$ref`` field holds the name of the collection where the
   referenced document resides.

.. describe:: $id

   The ``$id`` field contains the value of the ``_id`` field in the
   referenced document.

.. describe:: $db

   *Optional.*

   Contains the name of the database where the referenced document
   resides.

.. example::

   DBRef documents resemble the following document:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "$ref" : <value>, "$id" : <value>, "$db" : <value> }

   Consider a document from a collection that stored a DBRef in a
   ``creator`` field:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "_id" : ObjectId("5126bbf64aed4daf9e2ab771"),
        // .. application fields
        "creator" : {
                        "$ref" : "creators",
                        "$id" : ObjectId("5126bc054aed4daf9e2ab772"),
                        "$db" : "users",
                        "extraField" : "anything"
                     }
      }

   The DBRef in this example points to a document in the ``creators``
   collection of the ``users`` database that has
   ``ObjectId("5126bc054aed4daf9e2ab772")`` in its ``_id`` field. It also contains
   an optional field.

.. note::

   The order of fields in the DBRef matters, and you must use the above
   sequence when using a DBRef.

documents. However, if you need to reference documents from multiple
collections, consider using DBRefs.
