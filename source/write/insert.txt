Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+driver-short+} to add
documents to a MongoDB collection by performing insert operations.

An insert operation inserts one or more documents into a MongoDB collection.
You can perform an insert operation by using the ``insert_one()`` or
``insert_many()`` method.

.. .. tip:: Interactive Lab
   
..    This page includes a short interactive lab that demonstrates how to
..    insert data by using the ``insert_one()`` method. You can complete this
..    lab directly in your browser window without installing MongoDB or a code editor.

..    To start the lab, click the :guilabel:`Open Interactive Tutorial` button at the
..    top of the page. To expand the lab to a full-screen format, click the
..    full-screen button (:guilabel:`⛶`) in the top-right corner of the lab pane.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:ref:`<pymongo-get-started>` tutorial.

Insert One Document
-------------------

To add a single document to a MongoDB collection, call the ``insert_one()``
method and pass the document you want to add.

The following example inserts a document into the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. code-block:: python
   :copyable: true

   sample_restaurants.restaurants.insert_one({"name" : "Mongo's Burgers"})

You can also pass an instance of a custom class to the ``insert_one()`` method.
This provides additional type safety if you're using a type-checking
tool. The instance you pass must inherit from the ``TypedDict`` class.

.. note:: TypedDict in Python 3.7 and Earlier

   .. include:: /includes/type-hints/typeddict-availability.rst

The following example passes an instance of the ``Restaurant`` class to the ``insert_one()``
method for added type safety:

.. code-block:: python
   :copyable: true

   class Restaurant(TypedDict):
       name: str
   
   sample_restaurants.restaurants.insert_one(Restaurant(name="Mongo's Burgers")

.. include:: /includes/type-hints/tip-type-checkers.rst

Insert Multiple Documents
-------------------------

To add multiple documents to a MongoDB collection, call the ``insert_many()``
method and pass a list of documents you want to add.

The following example inserts a list of documents into the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. code-block:: python
   :copyable: true

   document_list = [
      { "name" : "Mongo's Burgers" },
      { "name" : "Mongo's Pizza" }
   ]

   sample_restaurants.restaurants.insert_many(document_list)

You can also pass a list of instances of a custom class to the ``insert_many()`` method.
This provides additional type safety if you're using a type-checking
tool. The instances you pass must inherit from the ``TypedDict`` class.

.. note:: TypedDict in Python 3.7 and Earlier

   .. include:: /includes/type-hints/typeddict-availability.rst

The following example calls the ``insert_many()`` method and passes a list that contains
instances of the ``Restaurant`` class. This adds type safety to the insert operation. 

.. code-block:: python
   :copyable: true

   class Restaurant(TypedDict):
       name: str
   
   document_list = [
      Restaurant(name="Mongo's Burgers"),
      Restaurant(name="Mongo's Pizza")
   ]

   sample_restaurants.restaurants.insert_many(document_list)

.. include:: /includes/type-hints/tip-type-checkers.rst

Modify Insert Behavior
----------------------

The ``insert_one()`` method optionally accepts additional parameters
which represent options you can use to configure the insert operation.
If you don't specify any additional parameters, the driver does
not customize the insert.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``bypass_document_validation``
     - | If set to ``True``, allows the write to opt out of
         :manual:`document-level validation </core/schema-validation>`. 
       | Defaults to ``False``.

   * - ``session``
     - | An instance of ``ClientSession``.

   * - ``comment``
     - | A comment to attach to the operation. For more information, see the :manual:`insert command
         fields </reference/command/insert/#command-fields>` guide in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual for more information.

The ``insert_many()`` method accepts the preceding optional parameters,
as well as the optional ``ordered`` property:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``ordered``
     - | If set to ``True``, the driver sends documents to the
         server in the order provided. If an error occurs, the driver
         and server cancel all remaining insert operations.
       | Defaults to ``True``. 

Example
~~~~~~~

The following code uses the ``insert_many()`` method to insert three new
documents into a collection. Because the second method argument is
``bypass_document_validation = True``, this insert operation bypasses 
document-level validation.

.. code-block:: python

  document_list = [
      { "name" : "Mongo's Burgers" },
      { "name" : "Mongo's Pizza" },
      { "name" : "Mongo's Tacos" }
   ]

   sample_restaurants.restaurants.insert_many(document_list, bypass_document_validation = True)

Troubleshooting
---------------

.. include:: /includes/type-hints/troubleshooting-client-type.rst

.. include:: /includes/type-hints/troubleshooting-incompatible-type.rst

You might see a similar error if you pass a list to the ``insert_one()`` method:

.. code-block:: bash

   error: Argument 1 to "insert_one" of "Collection" has
   incompatible type "List[Dict[<nothing>, <nothing>]]";
   expected "Mapping[str, Any]"

This error occurs because the ``insert_one()`` method accepts a document, not a list.
You can resolve this error by passing a document to the ``insert_one()`` method or by
calling the ``insert_many()`` method instead.

TypedDict Missing _id Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't specify the ``_id`` field, {+driver-short+} automatically
inserts it into the document.
You can retrieve the value of the ``_id`` field at runtime, but if you use MyPy or another
tool to perform static type-checking, it won't find the ``_id`` field in your class and
will show an error similar to the following: 

.. code-block:: bash

   TypedDict has no key "_id"

This is caused by code similar to the following:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 13

   from typing import TypedDict
   from pymongo import MongoClient
   from pymongo.collection import Collection
   class Movie(TypedDict):
       name: str
       year: int
   
   client: MongoClient = MongoClient()
   collection: Collection[Movie] = client.test.test
   inserted = collection.insert_one(Movie(name="Jurassic Park", year=1993))
   result = collection.find_one({"name": "Jurassic Park"})
   # _id is present but was added by PyMongo; this will raise a type-checking error
   assert result["_id"]

One solution is to add a ``# type:ignore``
comment to the end of the line that uses the ``_id`` field. This comment instructs the
type-checking tool to ignore any errors that the line causes. The following example shows
how to implement this solution;

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 15
   
   from typing import TypedDict
   from pymongo import MongoClient
   from pymongo.collection import Collection

   class Movie(TypedDict):
       name: str
       year: int

   collection: Collection[Movie] = client.test.test
   inserted = collection.insert_one(
       Movie(name="Jurassic Park", year=1993)
   )
   result = collection.find_one({"name": "Jurassic Park"})
   assert result is not None
   assert result["_id"] # type:ignore[typeddict-item]

Instead of ignoring the type error, you can avoid it by including the ``_id`` field in
your model class, and explicitly specifying a value for this field when you create the
class instance. The following code shows how to implement this solution:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 4,7,13

   from typing import TypedDict
   from pymongo import MongoClient
   from pymongo.collection import Collection
   from bson import ObjectId

   class Movie(TypedDict):
       _id: ObjectId
       name: str
       year: int

   collection: Collection[ExplicitMovie] = client.test.test
   inserted = collection.insert_one(
       ExplicitMovie(_id=ObjectId(), name="Jurassic Park", year=1993)
   )
   result = collection.find_one({"name": "Jurassic Park"})
   assert result is not None
   assert result["_id"]

One drawback to adding the ``_id`` field to your custom class is that you must include a
value for the field for every instance of the class that you create.
To avoid this, you can install the
``typing.NotRequired`` package, which includes the ``NotRequired`` type hint. If you
use this type hint for the ``_id`` field, you can access the value of the ``_id`` field
at runtime without seeing any compile-time type errors.

The following code example shows how to implement this solution:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import TypedDict, NotRequired
   from pymongo import MongoClient
   from pymongo.collection import Collection
   from bson import ObjectId
   
   class Movie(TypedDict):
        _id: NotRequired[ObjectId]
       name: str
       year: int
   
   client: MongoClient = MongoClient() 
   collection: Collection[Movie] = client.test.test
   inserted = collection.insert_one(Movie(name="Jurassic Park", year=1993))
   result = collection.find_one({"name": "Jurassic Park"})
   assert result is not None
   assert result["_id"]

.. important:: NotRequired Requires Python 3.11+
   
   The `NotRequired <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NotRequired>`__
   class is available only in Python 3.11 and later.
   To use ``NotRequired`` in earlier versions of Python, install the
   `typing_extensions <https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/>`__
   package instead.
