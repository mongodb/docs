Standalone Libraries
--------------------

- `Doctrine MongoDB ODM <https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb-odm>`__ (Object
  Document Mapper) is a library that provides object-mapping functionality for
  MongoDB.  You can use the standalone library or use one of the following
  framework integrations:

  - `Symfony <https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoDBBundle>`__
  - `Laminas <https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoODMModule>`__ (formerly Zend Framework)

- `Mongo PHP Adapter <https://github.com/alcaeus/mongo-php-adapter>`__ is a
  library designed to act as an adapter between applications that rely
  on the legacy ``mongo`` extension and the new ``mongodb`` extension. It
  offers the API of the legacy driver for the new driver and library.

- `Mongolid <https://github.com/leroy-merlin-br/mongolid>`__ is a performant
  ODM for PHP and MongoDB. It implements both ActiveRecord and DataMapper
  design patterns and supports embedded and referenced documents. You can use
  this standalone library or use the `Laravel <https://github.com/leroy-merlin-br/mongolid-laravel>`__
  integration.

- `Xenus <https://github.com/abellion/xenus>`__ is a MongoDB ODM
  that supports events, relationships, embedded documents, and more. You can
  use this standalone library or use the `Laravel <https://github.com/abellion/xenus-laravel>`__
  integration, which adds support for failed jobs, migrations, and events.

Framework Integrations
----------------------

- Drupal

  - `MongoDB integration for Drupal <https://www.drupal.org/project/mongodb>`__.
    This is a collection of several modules that allow sites to store different
    types of Drupal data in MongoDB. The ``mongodb`` extension supports
    Drupal 8 and later.

  - :ref:`php-drupal-integration` describes the benefits of using MongoDB
    as a data store in a Drupal site and provides useful links to learn
    about using this integration.

- Laravel

  - `Laravel MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/php/laravel-mongodb/current/>`__
    is MongoDB's official Eloquent model and query builder that supports 
    MongoDB by using the original Laravel API. This package extends the PHP 
    Laravel classes to work with MongoDB as a datastore in your Laravel 
    application.

- Symfony

  - :ref:`php-symfony-integration` describes the benefits of using MongoDB
    as a data store in a Symfony application and includes a tutorial to
    build a web application that uses this integration.

  - You can configure the `Lock <https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/lock.html#mongodbstore>`__
    and the `Session <https://symfony.com/doc/current/session.html#store-sessions-in-a-nosql-database-mongodb>`__
    to use MongoDB as a data store.

  - `MongoDB Bundle <https://github.com/facile-it/mongodb-bundle>`__ is a
    bundle service integration for the official `PHP library <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library>`__.
    You can use it to configure connections to different databases or clusters.
    This integration includes a query profiler.

  - `DoctrineMongoDBBundle Symfony <https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMongoDBBundle>`__
    This bundle integrates the Doctrine MongoDB ODM into Symfony so that you
    can store and retrieve objects from MongoDB.

- Yii2

  - `MongoDB Extension for Yii 2 <https://www.yiiframework.com/extension/yiisoft/yii2-mongodb>`__
    is a MongoDB integration for the Yii 2 framework.

- Flysystem

  - `MongoDB GridFS Adapter <https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/docs/adapter/gridfs/>`__
    allows you to interact with MongoDB :manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs/>`
    by using Flysystem.

Tools and Projects
------------------

- `PHP Cache <https://github.com/php-cache/mongodb-adapter/>`__ is a PSR-6 cache
  implementation that uses MongoDB as a cache pool. This project is part of
  the PHP Cache organization.

- `PHPfastcache <https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache>`__ is a
  high-performance backend cache system for MongoDB.

- `Enqueue <https://github.com/php-enqueue/mongodb>`__ is a production-ready
  messaging solution that uses MongoDB as the message queue broker. It provides
  a common way for programs to create, send, and read messages.

- `XHGui <https://github.com/perftools/xhgui>`__ is a web interface for the
  XHProf profiler, which stores profiling data in MongoDB.
