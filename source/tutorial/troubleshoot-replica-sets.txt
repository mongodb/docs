Troubleshoot Replica Sets
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This section describes common strategies for troubleshooting
:term:`replica set` deployments.

.. _replica-set-troubleshooting-check-replication-status:

Check Replica Set Status
------------------------

To display the current state of the replica set and current state of
each member, run the :method:`rs.status()` method in a :program:`mongo`
shell connected to the replica set's :term:`primary`. For descriptions
of the information displayed by :method:`rs.status()`, see
:doc:`/reference/command/replSetGetStatus`.

.. note::

   The :method:`rs.status()` method is a wrapper that runs the
   :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` database command.

.. _replica-set-replication-lag:

Check the Replication Lag
-------------------------

Replication lag is a delay between an operation on the :term:`primary`
and the application of that operation from the :term:`oplog` to the
:term:`secondary`. Replication lag can be a significant issue and can
seriously affect MongoDB :term:`replica set` deployments. Excessive
replication lag makes "lagged" members ineligible to quickly become
primary and increases the possibility that distributed read operations
will be inconsistent.

To check the current length of replication lag:

- In a :program:`mongo` shell connected to the primary, call the
  :method:`rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()` method.

  The returned document displays the ``syncedTo`` value for each member,
  which shows you when each member last read from the oplog, as shown in the following
  example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     source:   m1.example.net:30001
         syncedTo: Tue Oct 02 2012 11:33:40 GMT-0400 (EDT)
             = 7475 secs ago (2.08hrs)
     source:   m2.example.net:30002
         syncedTo: Tue Oct 02 2012 11:33:40 GMT-0400 (EDT)
             = 7475 secs ago (2.08hrs)

  .. note::

     The :method:`rs.status()` method is a wrapper around the
     :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` database command.

- Monitor the rate of replication by watching the oplog time in the
  "replica" graph in the `MongoDB Management Service`_. For more
  information see the `documentation for MMS`_.

.. _`MongoDB Management Service`: http://mms.mongodb.com/
.. _`documentation for MMS`: http://mms.mongodb.com/help/

Possible causes of replication lag include:

- **Network Latency**

  Check the network routes between the members of your set to ensure
  that there is no packet loss or network routing issue.

  Use tools including ``ping`` to test latency between set
  members and ``traceroute`` to expose the routing of packets
  network endpoints.

- **Disk Throughput**

  If the file system and disk device on the secondary is
  unable to flush data to disk as quickly as the primary, then
  the secondary will have difficulty keeping state. Disk-related
  issues are incredibly prevalent on multi-tenant systems, including
  virtualized instances, and can be transient if the system accesses
  disk devices over an IP network (as is the case with Amazon's
  EBS system.)

  Use system-level tools to assess disk status, including
  ``iostat`` or ``vmstat``.

- **Concurrency**

  In some cases, long-running operations on the primary can block
  replication on secondaries. For best results, configure :ref:`write
  concern <write-concern>` to require confirmation of replication to
  secondaries, as described in :ref:`replica set write concern
  <replica-set-write-concern>`. This prevents write operations from
  returning if replication cannot keep up with the write load.

  Use the :term:`database profiler` to see if there are slow queries
  or long-running operations that correspond to the incidences of lag.

- **Appropriate Write Concern**

  If you are performing a large data ingestion or bulk load operation
  that requires a large number of writes to the primary, particularly
  with :ref:`unacknowledged write concern
  <write-concern-unacknowledged>`, the secondaries will not be able to
  read the oplog fast enough to keep up with changes.

  To prevent this, require :ref:`write acknowledgment or journaled
  write concern <write-operations-write-concern>` after every 100,
  1,000, or an another interval to provide an opportunity for
  secondaries to catch up with the primary.

  For more information see:

  - :ref:`Replica Acknowledge Write Concern <replica-set-write-concern>`
  - :ref:`Replica Set Write Concern <write-operations-replica-sets>`
  - :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing`

.. _replica-set-troubleshooting-check-connection:

Test Connections Between all Members
------------------------------------

All members of a :term:`replica set` must be able to connect to every
other member of the set to support replication. Always verify
connections in both "directions."  Networking topologies and firewall
configurations prevent normal and required connectivity, which can
block replication.

Consider the following example of a bidirectional test of networking:

.. example:: Given a replica set with three members running on three separate
   hosts:

   - ``m1.example.net``
   - ``m2.example.net``
   - ``m3.example.net``

   1. Test the connection from ``m1.example.net`` to the other hosts
      with the following operation set ``m1.example.net``:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo --host m2.example.net --port 27017

         mongo --host m3.example.net --port 27017

   #. Test the connection from ``m2.example.net`` to the other two
      hosts with the following operation set from ``m2.example.net``,
      as in:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo --host m1.example.net --port 27017

         mongo --host m3.example.net --port 27017

      You have now tested the connection between
      ``m2.example.net`` and ``m1.example.net`` in both directions.

   #. Test the connection from ``m3.example.net`` to the other two
      hosts with the following operation set from the
      ``m3.example.net`` host, as in:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo --host m1.example.net --port 27017

         mongo --host m2.example.net --port 27017

   If any connection, in any direction fails, check your networking
   and firewall configuration and reconfigure your environment to
   allow these connections.

Socket Exceptions when Rebooting More than One Secondary
--------------------------------------------------------

When you reboot members of a replica set, ensure that the set is able
to elect a primary during the maintenance. This means ensuring that a majority of
the set's ':data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].votes` are
available.

When a set's active members can no longer form a majority, the set's
:term:`primary` steps down and becomes a :term:`secondary`. The former
primary closes all open connections to client applications. Clients
attempting to write to the former primary receive socket exceptions
and *Connection reset* errors until the set can elect a primary.

.. example:: Given a three-member replica set where every member has
   one vote, the set can elect a primary only as long as two members
   can connect to each other. If two you reboot the two secondaries
   once, the primary steps down and becomes a secondary. Until the at
   least one secondary becomes available, the set has no primary and
   cannot elect a new primary.

For more information on votes, see :doc:`/core/replica-set-elections`. For
related information on connection errors, see :ref:`faq-keepalive`.

.. _replica-set-troubleshooting-check-oplog-size:

Check the Size of the Oplog
---------------------------

A larger :term:`oplog` can give a replica set a greater tolerance for
lag, and make the set more resilient.

To check the size of the oplog for a given :term:`replica set` member,
connect to the member in a :program:`mongo` shell and run the
:method:`rs.printReplicationInfo()` method.

The output displays the size of the oplog and the date ranges of the
operations contained in the oplog. In the following example, the oplog
is about 10MB and is able to fit about 26 hours (94400 seconds) of
operations:

.. code-block:: javascript

   configured oplog size:   10.10546875MB
   log length start to end: 94400 (26.22hrs)
   oplog first event time:  Mon Mar 19 2012 13:50:38 GMT-0400 (EDT)
   oplog last event time:   Wed Oct 03 2012 14:59:10 GMT-0400 (EDT)
   now:                     Wed Oct 03 2012 15:00:21 GMT-0400 (EDT)

The oplog should be long enough to hold all transactions for the
longest downtime you expect on a secondary. At a minimum, an oplog
should be able to hold minimum 24 hours of operations; however, many
users prefer to have 72 hours or even a week's work of operations.

For more information on how oplog size affects operations, see:

- :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing`,
- :ref:`replica-set-delayed-members`, and
- :ref:`replica-set-replication-lag`.

.. note:: You normally want the oplog to be the same size on all
   members. If you resize the oplog, resize it on all members.

To change oplog size, see the :doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size`
tutorial.


Oplog Entry Timestamp Error
---------------------------

.. todo:: link assertion 13290 here once assertion guide exists.

Consider the following error in :program:`mongod` output and logs:

.. code-block:: javascript

   replSet error fatal couldn't query the local local.oplog.rs collection.  Terminating mongod after 30 seconds.
   <timestamp> [rsStart] bad replSet oplog entry?

Often, an incorrectly typed value in the ``ts`` field in the last
:term:`oplog` entry causes this error. The correct data type is
Timestamp.

Check the type of the ``ts`` value using the following two queries
against the oplog collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db = db.getSiblingDB("local")
   db.oplog.rs.find().sort({$natural:-1}).limit(1)
   db.oplog.rs.find({ts:{$type:17}}).sort({$natural:-1}).limit(1)

The first query returns the last document in the oplog, while the
second returns the last document in the oplog where the ``ts`` value
is a Timestamp. The :query:`$type` operator allows you to select
:term:`BSON type <BSON types>` 17, is the Timestamp data type.

If the queries don't return the same document, then the last document in
the oplog has the wrong data type in the ``ts`` field.

.. example::

   If the first query returns this as the last oplog entry:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "ts" : {t: 1347982456000, i: 1},
        "h" : NumberLong("8191276672478122996"),
        "op" : "n",
        "ns" : "",
        "o" : { "msg" : "Reconfig set", "version" : 4 } }

   And the second query returns this as the last entry where ``ts``
   has the ``Timestamp`` type:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "ts" : Timestamp(1347982454000, 1),
        "h" : NumberLong("6188469075153256465"),
        "op" : "n",
        "ns" : "",
        "o" : { "msg" : "Reconfig set", "version" : 3 } }

   Then the value for the ``ts`` field in the last oplog entry is of the
   wrong data type.

To set the proper type for this value and resolve this issue,
use an update operation that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.oplog.rs.update( { ts: { t:1347982456000, i:1 } },
                       { $set: { ts: new Timestamp(1347982456000, 1)}})

Modify the timestamp values as needed based on your oplog entry. This
operation may take some period to complete because the update must
scan and pull the entire oplog into memory.

Duplicate Key Error on ``local.slaves``
---------------------------------------

The *duplicate key on local.slaves* error, occurs when a
:term:`secondary` or :term:`slave` changes its hostname and the
:term:`primary` or :term:`master` tries to update its ``local.slaves``
collection with the new name. The update fails because it contains the
same ``_id`` value as the document containing the previous hostname. The
error itself will resemble the following.

.. code-block:: none

   exception: E11000 duplicate key error index: local.slaves.$_id_  dup key: { : ObjectId('<object ID>') } 0ms

This is a benign error and does not affect replication operations on
the :term:`secondary` or :term:`slave`.

To prevent the error from appearing, drop the ``local.slaves``
collection from the :term:`primary` or :term:`master`, with the
following sequence of operations in the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use local
   db.slaves.drop()

The next time a :term:`secondary` or :term:`slave` polls the
:term:`primary` or :term:`master`, the :term:`primary` or :term:`master`
recreates the ``local.slaves`` collection.
