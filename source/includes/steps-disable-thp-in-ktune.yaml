title: Create a new profile
stepnum: 1
ref: copy-profile
action:
  - pre: |
      If necessary, create a new profile from an existing default
      profile by copying the relevant directory. In the example we use
      the ``default`` profile as the base and call our new profile
      ``no-thp``, but you may start with any profile and name the
      new profile whatever you wish.
    language: sh
    code: |
      cp -r /etc/tune-profiles/default /etc/tune-profiles/no-thp
    post: |
      You may also opt to edit an existing profile.

title: Edit ``ktune.sh``
stepnum: 2
ref: edit-ktune
action:
  - pre: |
      Locate the ``ktune.sh`` file in the new profile directory
      (``/etc/tune-profiles/no-thp/ktune.sh`` in this case) and add
      the following:
    language: cfg
    code: |
      set_transparent_hugepages never
    post: |
      to the ``start()`` block of the file, before the ``return 0``
      statement.
---
title: Enable the new profile
stepnum: 3
ref: enable-profile
action:
  - pre: |
      Finally, enable the new profile by issuing:
    language: sh
    code: |
      tune-adm profile no-thp
    post: |
      where ``no-thp`` should be replaced with the name of the profile
      you defined, if it is different.

      .. warning::

         If you are using ``tuned`` and ``ktune`` and do not wish to
         disable them, you **must** use this method, or ``tuned`` may
         override THP settings configured using either of the other
         two methods.
