The {+atlas-cli+} pulls a Docker image and creates a container in order
to deploy the local cluster. By default, the {+atlas-cli+} pulls from
the public Docker Hub `repository
<https://hub.docker.com/r/mongodb/mongodb-atlas-local/tags>`__
``mongodb/mongodb-atlas-local``. You can configure it to pull a specific
image from an internal, typically private, registry.

This page explains how to pull and re-tag the ``mongodb-atlas-local``
container image, push it into a private registry, and then configure the
{+atlas-cli+} to use the private images for :ref:`deploying local
clusters <atlas-cli-deploy-local>`.

Prerequisites 
-------------

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following: 

- Docker command line tools
- Private container registry for which you have write permission
- A terminal
- {+atlas-cli+}

Procedure 
---------

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Pull and re-tag the MongoDB Local image for local deployment. 

      To pull and re-tag, run the following command after replacing the following
      placeholder values:

      .. list-table:: 
         :stub-columns: 1 

         * - ``<tag>``
           - The tag, which specifies the MongoDB version, that you want
             to use in your deployment.

         * - ``<container-registry-namespace>`` 
           - The fully qualified path and name of the container registry
             namespace for which you have write access.
    
      .. code-block:: shell 

         docker tag mongodb/mongodb-atlas-local:<tag> <container-registry-namespace>/mongodb-atlas-local:<tag>

      .. note:: 

         {+atlas-cli+} supports deploying MongoDB version 7 and 8. In
         order to support deploying either version from your registry
         using the {+atlas-cli+}, you must repeat this step for 7.0 and
         8.0 tags. For the list of available tags, see the `docker hub
         repository <https://hub.docker.com/r/mongodb/mongodb-atlas-local/tags>`__.  
 
   .. step:: Push the image on your machine to your container registry.

      a. Run the following command after replacing the following
         placeholder values to push the image to your container
         registry: 

         .. list-table:: 
            :stub-columns: 1 

            * - ``<tag>``
              - The tag, which specifies the MongoDB version, that you want
                to use in your deployment. 

            * - ``<container-registry-namespace>`` 
              - The fully qualified path and name of the container registry
                namespace for which you have write access.

         .. code-block:: shell

            docker push <container-registry-namespace>/mongodb-atlas-local:<tag>

         It might take a few minutes for this operation to complete.

         .. note:: 

            {+atlas-cli+} supports deploying MongoDB version 7 and 8. In
            order to support deploying either version from your registry
            using the {+atlas-cli+}, you must repeat this step for 7.0 and
            8.0 tags.  

      #. Verify that the image was successfully uploaded. 

         You can verify in the following ways: 

         - Log in to your container registry and verify that the image
           was successfully uploaded. 
         - Run the ``docker pull`` command to pull the image from your
           registry to your machine. 

   .. step:: Configure {+atlas-cli+} to use the image in the registry. 

      a. Set the ``MONGODB_ATLAS_LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT_IMAGE`` environment
         variable after replacing ``<container-registry-namespace>``
         with the fully qualified path and name of the container
         registry namespace that you created in step 2. 

         .. code-block:: shell 

            export MONGODB_ATLAS_LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT_IMAGE=<container-registry-namespace>/mongodb-atlas-local

         .. note:: 

            This method only sets the environment variable for the
            current terminal session. To persist this setting across
            terminal sessions, set this environment variable in your
            :ref:`profile stored in the configuration file
            <atlas-cli-profiles>`.  

      #. Verify that the environment variable is set correctly. 

         .. code-block:: shell 

            echo $MONGODB_ATLAS_LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT_IMAGE

      After you set the environment variable, {+atlas-cli+} uses the
      value of the variable instead of the default location for all
      deployments. 

   .. step:: Deploy |service| with your image. 

      a. Run the following command to start the deployment after
         replacing the ``<deploymentName>`` with a name for the
         deployment. 

         .. code-block:: shell 

            atlas deployments setup <deploymentName>

      #. Enter ``local`` when prompted to specify the type of
         deployment. 

      #. Complete the deployment by selecting the appropriate settings 
         when prompted.
