Run Aggregation Pipelines on Your Data
======================================

:manual:`Aggregation pipelines </core/aggregation-pipeline/>` transform
your documents into an aggregated set of results. In |charts|,
aggregation pipelines are commonly used to visualize new fields created
from calculated results of pre-existing fields, but also have many other
applications.

To create an aggregation pipeline:

1. In the :guilabel:`Query` bar, input an aggregation pipeline. Your
   pipeline must be in square brackets.
   
#. Click :guilabel:`Apply` to execute your pipeline.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following chart shows total sale amounts from an office supply
company, categorized by store location. The chart uses the
following aggregation pipeline in the :guilabel:`Query` bar:

.. code-block:: javascript

   [
     {
       $unwind: "$items"
     },
     {
       $addFields: {
         saleAmount: {
           $multiply: [ "$items.price", "$items.quantity" ]
         }
       }
     }
   ]

This aggregation pipeline processes the collection data using
the following order:

1. The :pipeline:`$unwind` stage unwinds the ``items`` array and
   outputs a new document for each item in the array. Each element
   in the ``items`` array contains a single item sold during a
   transaction.

#. The :pipeline:`$addFields` stage adds a new field to the
   documents called ``saleAmount``. The :expression:`$multiply`
   expression sets the value of ``saleAmount`` to the product of
   ``items.price`` and ``items.quantity``. You can see this
   new field highlighted in the following screenshot:

   :alt: Example Aggregation Pipeline

Once the data has been processed using the pipeline, the
chart displays the :guilabel:`Sum` of all
``saleAmounts`` categorized by store location.

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$lookup` operator is not supported in aggregation queries
defined in the Chart Builder. However, you can use this operator
in Data Source pipelines. To learn more about how to use pipelines 
to pre-process data before it reaches the Chart Builder, see
:ref:`data-sources-pipeline`.
