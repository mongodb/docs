Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to store and retrieve large files in
MongoDB using the **GridFS** specification. GridFS splits large files
into chunks and stores each chunk as a separate document. When you query
GridFS for a file, the driver assembles the chunks as necessary. The
driver implementation of GridFS is an abstraction that manages the operations
and organization of the file storage.

Use GridFS if the size of your files exceeds the BSON document size limit of
16 MB. GridFS also helps you access files without loading the entire file
into memory. To learn more about whether GridFS is suitable for
your use case, see :manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs>` in the Server manual.

How GridFS Works
----------------

GridFS organizes files in a **bucket**, a group of MongoDB collections
that contain the chunks of files and information describing them. The
bucket contains the following collections:

- ``chunks``, which stores the binary file chunks
- ``files``, which stores the file metadata

When you create a new GridFS bucket, the driver creates the preceding
collections. The default bucket name ``fs`` prefixes the collection names,
unless you specify a different bucket name. The driver creates the new GridFS
bucket during the first write operation.

The driver also creates an index on each collection to ensure efficient
retrieval of the files and related metadata. The driver creates indexes
if they do not already exist and when the bucket is empty. To learn more about
GridFS indexes, see :manual:`GridFS Indexes
</core/gridfs/#gridfs-indexes>` in the Server manual.

When storing files with GridFS, the driver splits the files into smaller
chunks, each represented by a separate document in the ``chunks`` collection.
It also creates a document in the ``files`` collection that contains
a file ID, file name, and other file metadata. The following diagram shows
how GridFS splits the uploaded files:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/GridFS-upload.png
   :alt: A diagram that shows how GridFS uploads a file to a bucket

When retrieving files, GridFS fetches the metadata from the ``files``
collection in the specified bucket then uses that information to reconstruct
the file from documents in the ``chunks`` collection. You can read the file
into memory or output it to a stream.

GridFS Operations
-----------------

The following sections describe how to perform GridFS operations:

- :ref:`<golang-create-bucket>`
- :ref:`<golang-upload-files>`
- :ref:`<golang-retrieve-info>`
- :ref:`<golang-download-files>`
- :ref:`<golang-rename-files>`
- :ref:`<golang-delete-files>`
- :ref:`<golang-delete-bucket>`

.. _golang-create-bucket:

Create a GridFS Bucket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To store or retrieve files from GridFS, create a bucket or get a reference to
an existing bucket on a MongoDB database. To create a ``GridFSBucket`` instance,
call the ``GridFSBucket()`` method on a ``Database`` instance, as shown
in the following code:

.. code-block:: go

   db := client.Database("myDB")
   bucket := db.GridFSBucket()

.. note::

   If a GridFS bucket already exists, the ``GridFSBucket()`` method returns a
   reference to the bucket rather than instantiating a new one.

By default, the driver sets the name of the bucket to ``fs``. To
create a bucket with a custom name, call the ``SetName()`` method
on a ``BucketOptions`` instance, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: go

   db := client.Database("myDB")
   bucketOpts := options.GridFSBucket().SetName("myCustomBucket")
   
   bucket := db.GridFSBucket(bucketOpts)

.. _golang-upload-files:

Upload Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can upload a file into a GridFS bucket by using one of the following
methods:

- ``UploadFromStream()``, which reads from an input stream
- ``OpenUploadStream()``, which writes to an output stream

For either upload process, you can specify configuration information by creating
an ``UploadOptions`` instance. To view a full list of options, see the
`UploadOptions API documentation <{+api+}/mongo/options#UploadOptions>`__.

Upload with an Input Stream
```````````````````````````

To upload a file with an input stream, use the ``UploadFromStream()`` method
and include the following parameters:

- File name
- ``io.Reader`` instance, including your opened file as a parameter
- ``opts`` parameter to modify the behavior of ``UploadFromStream()``

The following code example reads from a file called ``file.txt``,
creates an ``opts`` parameter to set file metadata, and uploads the
content to a GridFS bucket:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: go

      file, err := os.Open("home/documents/file.txt")
      uploadOpts := options.GridFSUpload().SetMetadata(bson.D{{"metadata tag", "first"}})

      objectID, err := bucket
         .UploadFromStream(
            "file.txt",
            io.Reader(file),
            uploadOpts
         )
      if err != nil {
         panic(err)
      }

      fmt.Printf("New file uploaded with ID %s", objectID)

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      New file uploaded with ID ...

Upload with an Output Stream
````````````````````````````

To upload a file with an output stream, use the ``OpenUploadStream()`` method
and include the following parameters:

- File name
- ``opts`` parameter to modify the behavior of ``OpenUploadStream()``

The following code example opens an upload stream on a GridFS bucket and sets
the number of bytes in each chunk in the options parameter. Then, it calls
the ``Write()`` method on the content of ``file.txt`` to write its content to
the stream:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/gridfs.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin OpenUploadStream example
   :end-before: end OpenUploadStream example

.. _golang-retrieve-info:

Retrieve File Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can retrieve file metadata stored in the ``files`` collection of the GridFS
bucket. Each document in the ``files`` collection contains the following
pieces of information:

- File ID
- File length
- Maximum chunk size
- Upload date and time
- File name
- ``metadata`` document that stores any other information

To retrieve file data, call the ``Find()`` method on a ``GridFSBucket``
instance. You can pass a query filter as an argument to ``Find()`` to match
only certain file documents.

.. note::

   You must pass a query filter to the ``Find()`` method. To retrieve all
   documents in the ``files`` collection, pass an empty query filter to ``Find()``.

The following example retrieves the file name and length of documents in
which the ``length`` value is greater than ``1500``:

.. code-block:: go

   filter := bson.D{{"length", bson.D{{"$gt", 1500}}}}
   cursor, err := bucket.Find(filter)
   if err != nil {
      panic(err)
   }

   type gridFSFile struct {
      Name   string `bson:"filename"`
      Length int64  `bson:"length"`
   }

   var foundFiles []gridFSFile
   if err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &foundFiles); err != nil {
      panic(err)
   }

   for _, file := range foundFiles {
      fmt.Printf("filename: %s, length: %d\n", file.Name, file.Length)
   }

.. _golang-download-files:

Download Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download a GridFS file by using one of the following methods:

- ``DownloadToStream()``, which downloads a file to an output stream
- ``OpenDownloadStream()``, which opens an input stream

Download a File to an Output Stream
```````````````````````````````````

You can download a file in a GridFS bucket directly to an output stream
by using the ``DownloadToStream()`` method. The ``DownloadToStream()``
method takes a file ID and an ``io.Writer`` instance as parameters. The
method downloads the file with the specified file ID and writes it to the
``io.Writer`` instance.

The following example downloads a file and writes to a file buffer:

.. code-block:: go

   id, err := bson.ObjectIDFromHex("62f7bd54a6e4452da13b3e88")
   fileBuffer := bytes.NewBuffer(nil)

   if _, err := bucket.DownloadToStream(id, fileBuffer); err != nil {
      panic(err)
   }

Download a File to an Input Stream
``````````````````````````````````

You can download a file in a GridFS bucket to memory with an input
stream by using the ``OpenDownloadStream()`` method. The
``OpenDownloadStream()`` method takes a file ID as a parameter and
returns an input stream from which you can read the file.

The following example downloads a file into memory and reads its contents:

.. code-block:: go

   id, err := bson.ObjectIDFromHex("62f7bd54a6e4452da13b3e88")
   downloadStream, err := bucket.OpenDownloadStream(id)
   if err != nil {
      panic(err)
   }

   fileBytes := make([]byte, 1024)
   if _, err := downloadStream.Read(fileBytes); err != nil {
      panic(err)
   }

.. _golang-rename-files:

Rename Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update the name of a GridFS file in your bucket by using the ``Rename()``
method. Pass a file ID value and a new ``filename`` value as arguments to
``Rename()``.

The following example renames a file to ``"mongodbTutorial.zip"``:

.. code-block:: go

   id, err := bson.ObjectIDFromHex("62f7bd54a6e4452da13b3e88")
   if err := bucket.Rename(id, "mongodbTutorial.zip"); err != nil {
       panic(err)
   }

.. _golang-delete-files:

Delete Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove a file from your GridFS bucket by using the ``Delete()`` method.
Pass a file ID value as an argument to ``Delete()``.

The following example deletes a file:

.. code-block:: go

   id, err := bson.ObjectIDFromHex("62f7bd54a6e4452da13b3e88")
   if err := bucket.Delete(id); err != nil {
      panic(err)
   }

.. _golang-delete-bucket:

Delete a GridFS Bucket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete a GridFS bucket by using the ``Drop()`` method.

The following code example removes a GridFS bucket:

.. code-block:: go

   if err := bucket.Drop(); err != nil {
      panic(err)
   }
