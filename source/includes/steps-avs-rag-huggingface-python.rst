   .. step:: Set up the environment.

      Create an interactive Python notebook by saving a file 
      with the ``.ipynb`` extension. This notebook allows you to 
      run Python code snippets individually. In your notebook, run the 
      following code to install the dependencies for this tutorial:

   .. step:: Ingest data into |service|.

      In this section, you :ref:`ingest <rag-ingestion>` sample 
      data into |service| that |llm|\s don't have access to.
      Paste and run each of the following code snippets in your notebook:

      a. Define a function to generate vector embeddings.

         Run this code to create a function that generates 
         vector embeddings by using an open-source embedding model. 
         Specifically, this code does the following:

         - Loads the `nomic-embed-text-v1 
           <https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1>`__ embedding model
           from `Sentence Transformers <https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers>`__.
           
         - Creates a function named ``get_embedding`` that uses the model
           to generate an embedding for a given text input.

         ..

      #. Load and split the data.

         Run this code to load and split sample data by using the
         :ref:`LangChain integration <langchain>`.
         Specifically, this code does the following:
         
         - Loads a PDF that contains a `MongoDB earnings report
           <https://investors.mongodb.com/node/12236/pdf>`__.
         
         - Splits the data into chunks, specifying the *chunk size*
           (number of characters) and *chunk overlap* (number of overlapping characters 
           between consecutive chunks).

         ..
            NOTE: If you edit this Python code, also update the Jupyter Notebook

            # Split the data into chunks
            text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=400, chunk_overlap=20)
            documents = text_splitter.split_documents(data)

      #. Convert the data to vector embeddings.

         Run this code to prepare the chunked documents for ingestion
         by creating a list of documents with their corresponding vector embeddings.
         You generate these embeddings by using the ``get_embedding`` function that 
         you just defined.

                "embedding": get_embedding(doc.page_content)
            } for doc in documents]

      #. Store the data and embeddings in |service|

         Run this code to insert the documents containing the embeddings 
         into the ``rag_db.test`` collection in your |service| 
         {+cluster+}. Before running the code, replace 
         ``<connection-string>`` with your |service| :ref:`connection string
         <connect-via-driver>`.

         .. tip:: 

            After you run the code, you can
            view your vector embeddings :ref:`in the {+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui-view-collections>`
            by navigating to the ``rag_db.test`` collection in your {+cluster+}.
      
   .. step:: Use {+avs+} to retrieve documents.

      In this section, you create a :ref:`retrieval <rag-retrieval>` 
      system using {+avs+} to get relevant documents from your vector database. 
      Paste and run each of the following code snippets in your notebook:

      a. Create an {+avs+} index on your vector embeddings.
      
         Run the following code to create the index directly
         from your application with the :driver:`PyMongo Driver </pymongo/>`.
         This code also includes a polling mechanism to check if the 
         index is ready to use.

         Run this code to create a retrieval function called
         ``get_query_results`` that runs a basic vector search query.
         It uses the ``get_embedding`` function to create embeddings from the
         search query. Then, it runs the query to return semantically similar
         documents.

      In this section, you :ref:`generate <rag-ingestion>` 
      responses by prompting an |llm| to use the retrieved documents 
      as context. 
      
      Replace ``<token>`` in the following code with your Hugging Face 
      access token, and then run the code in your notebook.
      This code does the following:

      - Uses the ``get_query_results`` function you defined to retrieve 
        relevant documents from |service|.
      - Creates a prompt using the user's question and retrieved
        documents as context.
      - Accesses the `Mistral 7B Instruct <https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3>`__ 
        model from Hugging Face's model hub.
      - Prompts the |llm| about MongoDB's latest AI announcements.
