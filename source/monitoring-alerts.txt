|service| provides built-in tools, alerts, charts, integrations, and 
logs to help you monitor your {+database-deployments+}. |service| 
provides the following ways to monitor your {+database-deployments+} 
and improve performance.

To learn about recommendations for monitoring and alerts, including
important metrics to monitor and recommended alert configurations, see
:ref:`arch-center-monitoring-alerts-recs` in the
{+atlas-arch-center+}.

Slow Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To optimize your query performance, :ref:`review the best 
practices for query performance <query-best-practices>`. You can also 
:ref:`analyze slow queries <analyze-slow-queries>` and troubleshoot 
slow operations executed on your clusters.

Use the following built-in tools:

- :ref:`Monitor and improve slow queries <performance-advisor>` with 
  the Performance Advisor.

- :ref:`Monitor collection-level query latency <namespace-insights>` 
  with Namespace Insights.
   
- :ref:`Monitor query performance <profile-database>` with the Query 
  Profiler.

- :ref:`Monitor real-time performance <real-time-metrics-status-tab>` 
  with the Real-Time Performance Panel.

Schema Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To optimize your schema design, review our frequently used :ref:`schema 
design patterns <schema-design-patterns>`. You can also :ref:`improve 
your schema <schema-suggestions>`. Improve your schema based on 
recommendations from the :ref:`Performance Advisor 
<performance-advisor>` and the :ref:`{+atlas-ui+} 
<atlas-ui-dbs>`.

Alerts
~~~~~~

To trigger alerts based on :ref:`alert conditions <alert-conditions>` 
and to help ensure {+database-deployment+} performance, 
:ref:`configure alerts and resolve them promptly <alerts>`. You can 
configure alerts based on specific conditions for your 
databases, users, accounts, and more. When you resolve alerts, you 
should fix the immediate problem, implement a long-term solution, and 
monitor your progress.

{+database-deployment+} metrics <monitor-cluster-metrics>`. View historical 
throughput, performance, and utilization metrics for your databases. To 
learn more, :ref:`review the available metrics 
<review-available-metrics>`.

Third-Party Integrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To receive |service| alerts in various 
external monitoring services, 
:ref:`integrate with third-party monitoring services
