Overview
--------

If the Monitoring Agent cannot collect information from a MongoDB
instance, MMS deactivates the instance in the Monitoring Agent and in
the console. MMS deactivates a :program:`mongos` that is unreachable
for 24 hours and a :program:`mongod` that is unreachable for 7 days.

When the system deactivates an instance, the
:guilabel:`Deployment` page marks the deactivated instance with an ``x``
in the :guilabel:`Last Ping` column. If the instance is a
:program:`mongod`, MMS displays a caution icon at the top of each
:guilabel:`Deployment` page.

You can reactivate a deactivated instance whether or not it is running.
When you reactivate a host, the Monitoring Agent has an hour to
reestablish contact and provide a ping to MMS. If a host is running and
reachable, it appears marked with a green circle in the :guilabel:`Last
Ping` column. If it is unavailable, it appears marked with a
red square. If it remains unreachable for an hour, MMS deactivates it
again.

You can optionally remove a host that you are no longer using. Removed
hosts are permanently hidden from MMS. For more information, see
:ref:`removing-hosts`.
