Requirements
------------

For production deployments, you should maintain as much separation between
members as possible by hosting the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances on separate machines. When using virtual machines for
production deployments, you should place each :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance on a separate host server serviced by redundant power circuits
and redundant network paths.

Before you can deploy a replica set, you must install MongoDB on
each system that will be part of your :term:`replica set`.
If you have not already installed MongoDB, see the :ref:`installation tutorials <tutorial-installation>`.
