Create MongoDB database users to provide clients access to the clusters
in your project. A database user's access is determined by the roles
assigned to the user. When you create a database user, the user is added
to all clusters in your |service| project. 

MongoDB database users are separate from |service| users. Database users
have access to MongoDB databases, while |service| users have access to
the |service| application itself. |service| supports creating temporary
database users that automatically expire within a user-configurable
7-day period. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-user-auditing.rst

The available |service|
:ref:`database user privileges <atlas-user-privileges>` support
a subset of MongoDB commands. See :ref:`paid-tier-command-limitations`
for more information.

.. important::

   |service| rolls back any user modifications not made through the UI
   or :doc:`API </reference/api/database-users>`. You must use the
   |service| UI or API to add, modify, or delete database users on
   |service| clusters.

.. _add-mongodb-users:

Add Database Users
------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/add-users.rst

You can also add database users through the |service| API. See
:doc:`/reference/api/database-users-create-a-user`.

Modify Database Users
---------------------

To modify existing users for an |service| project:

#. In the :guilabel:`Security` section in the left navigation,
   click :guilabel:`Database Access`. The :guilabel:`Database Users` tab
   displays.

#. Click :icon-fa4:`pencil`
   :guilabel:`Edit` for the user you want to modify.
   You can modify the privileges and authentication details assigned to
   the user. You cannot modify the authentication method.
   
   - For SCRAM authenticated users, you can edit a user's password.

   - For X.509 certificate authenticated users, you can download a new
     certificate.

   For temporary users, you can also modify the time
   period the user exists or make the user a permanent user,
   provided the user's expiration date has not already passed.

   .. note::

      You cannot change a permanent user into a temporary user. If you
      change a temporary user into a permanent user, you cannot make it
      temporary again.

#. Click :guilabel:`Update User` to save the changes.

You can also modify existing users through the |service| API. See
:doc:`/reference/api/database-users-update-a-user`.

Delete Database Users
---------------------

To delete existing users for an |service| project:

#. In the :guilabel:`Security` section in the left navigation, click
   :guilabel:`Database Access`. The :guilabel:`Database Users` tab
   displays.

#. Click :icon-fa4:`trash-o` :guilabel:`Delete` next to the user you
   want to delete.

#. Click :guilabel:`Delete` again to confirm.

You can also delete existing users through the |service| API. See
:doc:`/reference/api/database-users-delete-a-user`.

MongoDB Database User Privileges
--------------------------------

The following table describes the |service| Database User Privileges
and the MongoDB
:manual:`Built-in Roles </core/security-built-in-roles>` or
:manual:`privilege actions </reference/privilege-actions>` they
represent.
