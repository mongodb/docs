You can configure |compass| to not perform outgoing network operations
other than those to the database. This lets you configure any
:ref:`edition <compass-feature-table>` of |compass-short| to restrict
outgoing connections in the same way :ref:`Compass Isolated Edition
<compass-faq-isolated>` restricts connections.

.. warning::
   
   When you block outgoing network connections, |compass-short| can't use 
   third-party mapping services in :ref:`schema visualizations <compass-schema-tab>`.

Procedure
---------

To block outgoing network operations, disable the ``networkTraffic``
configuration option. You can set configuration options in either a
command line option or :ref:`configuration file <config-file>` option. 

Command Line Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following command starts |compass| from the command line and sets
the ``--no-networkTraffic`` option:

.. code-block:: sh

   <path-to-Compass-executable> --no-networkTraffic

.. note::

  The name and filepath of the |compass-short| executable depend on your
  operating system.

Configuration File Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify the |compass-short| configuration file in either EJSON
or YAML format. The following configurations set the ``networkTraffic``
option to ``false``:

EJSON
`````

.. code-block:: json

   { "networkTraffic": false }

YAML
````

.. code-block:: yaml

   networkTraffic: false
