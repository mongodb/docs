Occasionally you might want to include content from a third-party
source. If you do so, you must make sure that the source is reputable,
the information is accurate, the quoted material is distinguished from
the surrounding content, and the source is cited. Follow these
guidelines:

-  Include content only from expert sources that have a named author or
   are from a known company. Don't quote Wikipedia articles.

-  If necessary, verify that the content is accurate.

-  Set off the quoted content from the other content in the following
   ways:

   -  If the quotation is short (just a phrase or sentence), you can
      include it in an existing paragraph. Set the quotation off with
      quotation marks, and put ending punctuation within the closing
      quotation mark.

   -  If the quotation is longer than a phrase or sentence, or it makes
      sense to separate it from the surrounding content, you can place
      it in its own paragraph. Indent the paragraph to set it off from
      the surrounding paragraphs.

   -  Don't use italics or bold to distinguish quoted content. Use such
      formatting only if it was used in the source.

-  Attribute the source as follows:

   -  If you have just one or two quotations, you can attribute them
      within the article text by stating the author, the source
      document, or both and providing a link to the source. Usually
      such an attribution would precede the quotation, as an
      introduction to it.

   -  If you have more than one or two quotations, follow each
      quotation with a number in square brackets. Start at [1] and
      number each quotation in the document consecutively. At the end
      of the document, use a numbered list to list each resource in the
      order that it's shown in the article. Cite the author, the name
      of the source, and provide a link to the source. Put the list
      under a heading such as “Numbered citations in this article.”
      Then, go back to each numbered reference in the article and
      create a link between the reference number (such as [1]) and the
      numbered item at the end of the article.
