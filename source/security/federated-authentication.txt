To link your |idp| to |service| you provide each with the appropriate
metadata. After you link your |idp| to |service|, map domains,
organizations, and roles to your |idp|:

Domain Mapping
  |service| routes users with email addresses that use
  :ref:`mapped domains <atlas-manage-fed-domain-map>` to the associated
  |idp|.

Organization Mapping
  |service| grants users who log in through the |idp| access to
  :ref:`mapped Atlas organizations <atlas-manage-fed-org-map>`.

Role Mapping
  As part of the organization mapping, you can choose which
  :ref:`role <organization-roles>` to grant your users. These roles map
  to groups in your |idp|.

Federation Management Access
----------------------------

To open the :guilabel:`Federation Management` console:

.. include:: /includes/steps/open-fed-auth-console.rst

Quick Start
-----------

If you're configuring single sign-on for users in your organization for 
the first time, you can follow MongoDB's federation management 
Quick Start Guide.

To configure single sign-on with the Quick Start Guide:

.. include:: /includes/steps/open-fed-auth-console-quick-start.rst

.. note::
   
   If you've already completed the federation management Quick Start 
   but want to go through those steps again, click the link at the 
   bottom of the :guilabel:`Federation Management` console
   :guilabel:`Overview` page.

Tutorials
---------

To configure federated authentication from the :guilabel:`Federation 
Management` console in |service|, you must:

1. Click :guilabel:`Manage Identity Providers` and :ref:`Link an 
   Identity Provider to Atlas <atlas-manage-fed-auth>` to ensure that 
   your users are authenticated through your trusted
   |idp|. 

2. Click :guilabel:`Manage Domains` and :ref:`Map Domains to your 
   Identity Provider <atlas-manage-fed-domain-map>` to simplify the 
   login experience for users from specified domains. |service| 
   authenticates users through a mapped |idp| if their email address 
   matches a mapped domain. 

After federating authentication, you can simplify user authorization. 
In the :guilabel:`Federation Management` console, click 
:guilabel:`Manage Organizations`. You can perform these activities:

1. :ref:`Map Atlas organizations <atlas-manage-fed-org-map>` to your
   |idp|. 
2. :ref:`Map Atlas roles <atlas-manage-fed-auth-roles>` to groups in
   your |idp|.

.. _fed-auth-2fa:

Consideration for Two-Factor Authentication
-------------------------------------------

When you configure federated authentication and users authenticate
through your |idp|, |service| |2fa| for those users is bypassed. If a
user authenticates through your |idp| and has |2fa| for their |service|
account enabled, |service| does not prompt the user for |2fa|. Instead,
you can configure your trusted |idp| to prompt users for |2fa|.
