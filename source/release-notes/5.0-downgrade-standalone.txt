Create Backup

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Access Control

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of your standalone:

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/5.0-downgrade-fcv.rst

2. Remove fCV |newversion| Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps are necessary only if fCV has ever been set to
|newfcv|.

Remove all persisted |newversion| |features| that are incompatible with
|oldversion|. These include:

- No persisted features currently.

.. |binary| replace:: the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance

3. Remove |newversion| Features
