   :returns: Boolean.

   :method:`cursor.isClosed()` returns ``true`` if the server has
   closed the cursor. 

   A closed cursor may still have documents remaining in the last
   received batch. Use :method:`cursor.isExhausted()` or 
   :method:`cursor.hasNext()` to check if the cursor is fully
   exhausted.
