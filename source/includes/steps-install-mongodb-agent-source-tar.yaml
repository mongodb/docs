  to move the archive to another directory before extracting, you may
  do so.

  To install the MongoDB Agent, extract the archive:

  .. code-block:: sh

     tar -xvzf mongodb-mms-automation-agent-<VERSION>.{{fileBuild}}.tar.gz

  Create the following directories to store files that the
  {+mdbagent+} needs.

  .. note::

     The use of ``mongodb-mms-automation`` in the file path is a
     legacy artifact and does not mean that the {+mdbagent+} is being
     installed with Automation configured.

     * - Component
       - Default Directory
       - Description

     * - Binaries
       - ``/var/lib/mongodb-mms-automation``
       - These are the binaries that the {+mdbagent+} manages.
         They include the {+mdbagent+}, BI Connector, and MongoDB
         binaries.

     * - MongoDB Agent logs
       - ``/var/log/mongodb-mms-automation``
       - These are the log files that the {+mdbagent+} creates.

     * - MongoDB databases
       - ``/data``
       - These are the databases that the {+mdbagent+} creates and
         manages.

  Run the following commands to create the directories:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo mkdir -m 755 -p /var/lib/mongodb-mms-automation
     sudo mkdir -m 755 -p /var/log/mongodb-mms-automation
     sudo mkdir -m 755 -p /data
