.. tip:: Apple Account Deletion Requirements

   Apple :apple:`requires that applications distributed through the App Store 
   <app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1>` must give any user who creates 
   an account the option to delete the account. Whether that app uses an 
   authentication method where you must manually register a user, such as 
   email/password authentication, or one that automatically creates a 
   user, such as Sign-In with Apple, an app distributed through the App Store 
   must implement :ref:`user account deletion <delete-user>`.
