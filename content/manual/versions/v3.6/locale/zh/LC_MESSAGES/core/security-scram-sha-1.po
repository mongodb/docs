"``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is the default authentication mechanism for MongoDB. "
"``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is an IETF standard, `RFC 5802 "
"<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`_, that defines best practice methods "
"for implementation of challenge-response mechanisms for authenticating users"

"<admin.system.users.credentials>` and :data:`authentication database "
"<admin.system.users.db>`. The authentication database is the database where "
