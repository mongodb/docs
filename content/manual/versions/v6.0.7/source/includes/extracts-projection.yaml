ref: projection-path-collision-embedded-document-full
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, it is illegal to project an embedded
   document with any of the embedded document's fields.

   For example, consider a collection ``inventory`` with documents that
   contain a ``size`` field:
  
   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { ..., size: { h: 10, w: 15.25, uom: "cm" }, ... }

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following operation fails with a ``Path
   collision`` error because it attempts to project both ``size`` document
   and the ``size.uom`` field:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.inventory.find( {}, { size: 1, "size.uom": 1 } )  // Invalid starting in 4.4

   In previous versions, lattermost projection between the embedded
   documents and its fields determines the projection:

   - If the projection of the embedded document comes after any and all
     projections of its fields, MongoDB projects the embedded document.
     For example, the projection document ``{ "size.uom": 1, size: 1 }``
     produces the same result as the projection document ``{ size: 1 }``.

   - If the projection of the embedded document comes before the
     projection any of its fields, MongoDB projects the specified field or
     fields. For example, the projection document ``{ "size.uom": 1, size:
     1, "size.h": 1 }`` produces the same result as the projection
     document ``{ "size.uom": 1, "size.h": 1 }``.

ref: projection-path-collision-slice-embedded-field-full
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, |findoperation| projection
   cannot contain both a :projection:`$slice` of an array and a field
   embedded in the array. 

   For example, consider a collection ``inventory`` that contains an array
   field ``instock``:
  
   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { ..., instock: [ { warehouse: "A", qty: 35 }, { warehouse: "B", qty: 15 }, { warehouse: "C", qty: 35 } ], ... }

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following operation fails with a ``Path
   collision`` error:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.inventory.find( {}, { "instock": { $slice: 1 }, "instock.warehouse": 0 } ) // Invalid starting in 4.4

   In previous versions, the projection applies both projections and
   returns the first element (``$slice: 1``) in the ``instock`` array
   but suppresses the ``warehouse`` field in the projected element.
   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, to achieve the same result, use the
   :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method with two separate
   :pipeline:`$project` stages.

ref: projection-dollar-prefixed-field-full
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the |findoperation| projection cannot
   project a field that starts with ``$`` with the exception of the
   :ref:`DBRef fields <dbref-explanation>`.

   For example, starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following operation is
   invalid:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.inventory.find( {}, { "$instock.warehouse": 0, "$item": 0, "detail.$price": 1 } ) // Invalid starting in 4.4

   In earlier version, MongoDB ignores the ``$``-prefixed field
   projections.
---
ref: projection-positional-operator-slice-full
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, |findoperation| projection
   cannot include :projection:`$slice` projection expression as part of a
   :projection:`$` projection expression. 
   
   For example, starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following operation is
   invalid:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.inventory.find( { "instock.qty": { $gt: 25 } }, { "instock.$": { $slice: 1 } } ) // Invalid starting in 4.4

   In previous versions, MongoDB returns the first element
   (``instock.$``) in the ``instock`` array that matches the query
   condition; i.e. the positional projection ``"instock.$"`` takes
   precedence and the ``$slice:1`` is a no-op. The ``"instock.$": {
   $slice: 1 }`` does not exclude any other document field.
   
---
ref: projection-empty-field-full
content: |
   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, |findoperation| projection
   cannot include a projection of an empty field name. 

   For example, starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following operation is
   invalid:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.inventory.find( { }, { "": 0 } ) // Invalid starting in 4.4

   In previous versions, MongoDB treats the inclusion/exclusion of the
   empty field as it would the projection of non-existing fields.

      * - Projection
        - Description

      * - ``<field>: <0 or false>``

        - Specifies the exclusion of a field.

      * - ``"<field>.$": <1 or true>``

        - With the use of the :projection:`$` array projection operator,
          you can specify the projection to return the **first** element
          that match the query condition on the array field; e.g.
          ``"arrayField.$" : 1``. (Not available for :doc:`views
          </core/views>`.)  Non-zero integers are also treated as 
          ``true``.

      * - ``<field>: <array projection>``

        - Using the array projection operators :projection:`$elemMatch`,
          :projection:`$slice`, specifies the array element(s) to include,
          thereby excluding those elements that do not meet the
          expressions. (Not available for :doc:`views </core/views>`.)

      * - ``<field>: <$meta expression>``

        - Using the :expression:`$meta` operator expression, specifies the
          inclusion of available :expression:`per-document metadata
          <$meta>`. (Not available for :doc:`views </core/views>`.)


      * - ``<field>: <aggregation expression>``

        - Specifies the value of the projected field.

          Starting in MongoDB 4.4, with the use of :ref:`aggregation
          expressions and syntax <aggregation-expressions>`, including the
          use of literals and aggregation variables, you can project new
          fields or project existing fields with new values. For example,
       
          - If you specify a non-numeric, non-boolean literal (such as a
            literal string or an array or an operator expression) for the
            projection value, the field is projected with the new value;
            e.g.:

            - ``{ field: [ 1, 2, 3, "$someExistingField" ] }``
            - ``{ field: "New String Value" }``
            - ``{ field: { status: "Active", total: { $sum: "$existingArray" } } }``

          - To project a literal value for a field, use the :expression:`$literal`
            aggregation expression; e.g.:

            - ``{ field: { $literal: 5 } }``
         
            - ``{ field: { $literal: true } }``

            - ``{ field: { $literal: { fieldWithValue0: 0, fieldWithValue1: 1 } } }`` 
            
          In versions 4.2 and earlier, any specification value (with
          the exception of the :ref:`previously unsupported document
          value <4.4-projection>`) is treated as either ``true``
          or ``false`` to indicate the inclusion or exclusion of
          the field.

      Starting in MongoDB 4.4, as part of making
      :method:`~db.collection.find` and
      :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify` projection consistent with
      aggregation's :pipeline:`$project` stage,
   
      - The :method:`~db.collection.find` and
        :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify` projection can accept
        :ref:`aggregation expressions and syntax

      - MongoDB enforces additional restrictions with regards to

---
ref: projection-elemMatch-projection-field-order
content: |
 
    Starting in MongoDB 4.4, regardless of the ordering of the fields
    in the document, the :projection:`$elemMatch` projection of an
    existing field returns the field after the other existing field
    inclusions.

    For example, consider a ``players`` collection with the following document:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       db.players.insertOne( { 
          name: "player1", 
          games: [ { game: "abc", score: 8 }, { game: "xyz", score: 5 } ], 
          joined: new Date("2020-01-01"),
          lastLogin: new Date("2020-05-01")
       } )

    In version 4.4+, the following projection returns the ``games`` field
    after the other existing fields included in the projection even though
    in the document, the field is listed before ``joined`` and
    ``lastLogin`` fields:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        db.players.find( {}, { games: { $elemMatch: { score: { $gt: 5 } } }, joined: 1, lastLogin: 1 } )

    That is, the operation returns the following document:

    .. code-block:: javascript 
       :copyable: false

       { 
          "_id" : ObjectId("5edef64a1c099fff6b033977"),
          "joined" : ISODate("2020-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
          "lastLogin" : ISODate("2020-05-01T00:00:00Z"),
          "games" : [ { "game" : "abc", "score" : 8 } ]
       }

    In version 4.2 and earlier, the :projection:`$elemMatch` projection of
    an existing field upholds the ordering in the document:

    .. code-block:: javascript
       :copyable: false

       { 
         "_id" : ObjectId("5edef91e76ddff7d92f118e1"), 
         "games" : [ { "game" : "abc", "score" : 8 } ],
         "joined" : ISODate("2020-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
         "lastLogin" : ISODate("2020-05-01T00:00:00Z") 
       }
---
ref: projection-positional-operator-path
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :projection:`$` projection operator can
   only appear at the end of the field path; e.g. ``"field.$"``
   or ``"fieldA.fieldB.$"``.
   
   For example, starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following operation is
   invalid:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.inventory.find( { }, { "instock.$.qty": 1 } ) // Invalid starting in 4.4

   To resolve, remove the component of the field path that follows the
   :projection:`$` projection operator.

   In previous versions, MongoDB ignores the part of the path that follows
   the ``$``; i.e. the projection is treated as ``"instock.$"``. 
---
ref: projection-slice-operator-inclusion
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the :projection:`$slice` projection of an
   array in an nested document no longer returns the other fields in
   the nested document when the projection is part of an inclusion
   projection. 
   
   For example, consider a collection ``inventory`` with documents that
   contain a ``size`` field:
  
   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { item: "socks", qty: 100, details: { colors: [ "blue", "red" ], sizes: [ "S", "M", "L"] } }
      
   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following operation projects the
   ``_id`` field (by default), the ``qty`` field, and the ``details``
   field with just the specified slice of the ``colors`` array:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.inventory.find( { }, { qty: 1, "details.colors": { $slice: 1 } } )
   
   That is, the operation returns the following document:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false
      
      { "_id" : ObjectId("5ee92a6ec644acb6d13eedb1"), "qty" : 100, "details" : { "colors" : [ "blue" ] } }
      
   If the :projection:`$slice` projection is part of an exclusion
   projection, the operation continues to return the other fields in
   the nested document. That is, the following projection is an
   exclusion projection. The projection excludes the ``_id`` field and
   the elements in the ``colors`` array that fall outside the specified
   slice and returns all other fields.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.inventory.find( { }, { _id: 0, "details.colors": { $slice: 1 } } )
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { "item" : "socks", "qty" : 100, "details" : { "colors" : [ "blue" ], "sizes" : [ "S", "M", "L" ] } }

   The :projection:`$slice` projection by itself is considered an exclusion.
   
   In previous versions, the :projection:`$slice` projection also
   include the other fields in the nested document regardless of
   whether the projection is an inclusion or an exclusion.

---
ref: projection-id-field
content: |

   The ``_id`` field is included in the returned documents by default unless
   you explicitly specify ``_id: 0`` in the projection to suppress the field.

---
ref: projection-inclusion-exclusion
content: |
   
   A ``projection`` *cannot* contain *both* include and exclude
   specifications, with the exception of the ``_id`` field:

   - In projections that *explicitly include* fields, the ``_id`` field is
     the only field that you can *explicitly exclude*.

   - In projections that *explicitly excludes* fields, the ``_id`` field
     is the only field that you can *explicitly include*; however, the
     ``_id`` field is included by default.
