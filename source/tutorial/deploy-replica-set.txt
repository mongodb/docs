====================
Deploy a Replica Set
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

A :term:`replica set` is a group of MongoDB deployments that maintain the same
data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability and are the
basis for all production deployments. See the :manual:`Replication
Introduction </core/replication-introduction>` in the MongoDB manual for more
information about replica sets.

Use this procedure to deploy a new replica set managed by MMS. After
deployment, use MMS to manage the replica set, including such operations as
adding, removing, and reconfiguring members.

Consideration
-------------

Use unique replica set names for different replica sets within an MMS group.
Do not give different replica sets the same name. MMS uses the replica set
name to identify which set a member belongs to.
