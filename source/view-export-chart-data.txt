View and Export Chart Data

While editing a chart in the Chart Builder, you can view underlying
data from the :guilabel:`Ellipses (...)` dropdown menu. Access to
underlying data is intended to help you build meaningful charts as well
as export that data for use with third-party tools.

.. _view-source-documents:

View Source Documents
---------------------

Once you have selected a :doc:`data source <data-sources>` for your
chart, you can view up to 20 sample documents from that data source by
clicking :guilabel:`View Source Documents` from the
:icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` menu.

.. note::
   If you want to explore your data source beyond 20 sample documents,
   you can use :compass:`Compass </>` or the 
   :atlas:`Atlas Data Explorer </data-explorer/>`.

The sample documents are intended for reference to help you build a
chart. The documents do not reflect any groupings or projections
applied to an existing chart (i.e. any :guilabel:`Encode` panel options
in the Chart Builder). The documents are produced with a query on your
data source that considers:

- :ref:`Pipelines applied to the data source <data-sources-pipeline>`

- :ref:`Sample mode <charts-sample-mode>` (if toggled on)

- :ref:`Queries <query-bar>` or
  :ref:`pipelines specified in the Chart Builder <charts-agg-pipeline>`
  
- Filters applied in the :ref:`Filter Tab <filter-tab>`

The :guilabel:`Source Documents` modal displays the number of documents
from your data source that match your query conditions, although only
20 of the documents are viewable as samples.

   :figwidth: 80%
   :alt: The View Source Documents modal displays the document count just above the document samples.

.. _view-aggregation-pipeline:

View Aggregation Pipeline
-------------------------

After you have configured a valid chart, you can view the source query
for the chart. MongoDB Charts uses a special type of query to create a
chart called an 
:manual:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>`. To view
the query, click :guilabel:`View Aggregation Pipeline` from the
:icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` menu. This aggregation pipeline includes the
stages that both the data source and the Chart Builder apply.

.. important::

   Some Chart Builder :doc:`configuration options </customize-charts>`
   don't apply aggregation stages. These options are applied to a
   chart's visualization and do not affect the underlying data.

To use the pipeline in other MongoDB tools, such as 
:compass:`Compass </>` or the :manual:`mongo shell </mongo>`, click 
:icon-fa5:`copy` next to the pipeline in the 
:guilabel:`Aggregation Pipeline` modal. 

To learn how Charts constructs aggregation pipelines, 
see :ref:`aggregation-pipeline-generation`.

.. _get-chart-data:

Get Chart Data
--------------

After you have configured a valid chart, you can view and export the
underlying data as a table. To view the chart data, click 
:guilabel:`Get Chart Data` from the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` menu. Each
row in the table represents a data point.
