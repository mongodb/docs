Overview
--------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/alert-overview.rst

To set a condition:

#. Select a :guilabel:`Target` from the list.
#. Select a condition in the :guilabel:`condition/metric` list.

|mms| triggers an alert when the condition is ``true`` on the specified target
MongoDB instance.

To set a metric:

#. Select on a :guilabel:`Target` from the list.
#. Select on a metric in the :guilabel:`condition/metric` list.
#. Select if this metric should be :guilabel:`Below` or :guilabel:`Above` the
   threshold.
#. Type a threshold value. All thresholds are numbers.
#. Select the unit of measure for the threshold.

|mms| triggers an alert when the metric threshold is met on the specified
target MongoDB instance.

Host Alerts
-----------

When setting an alert for a host, select the :guilabel:`host type` that
applies to this alert and the :guilabel:`condition` that triggers this alert.

   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Set Host Type to:

     - Alert Includes

   * - Any type

     - All the types described in this table.

   * - Standalone

     - Any :term:`mongod` instance that is *neither* part of a replica
       set or sharded cluster *nor* used as a config server.

   * - Primary

     - All replica set :term:`primaries <primary>`.

   * - Secondary

     - All replica set :term:`secondaries <secondary>`.

   * - Mongos

     - All :term:`mongos` instances.

`````````````````````
You can set an alert for when MongoDB instance changes. Host status conditions
include:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Condition
     - Alert Trigger

   * - Host added
     - |mms| starts monitoring or managing a :program:`mongod` or
       :program:`mongos` process for the first time.

   * - Host removed
     - |mms| stops monitoring or managing a :program:`mongod` or
       :program:`mongos` process for the first time.

   * - Host added to replica set
     - The specified type of :program:`mongod` process is added to a
       :term:`replica set`.

   * - Host removed from replica set
     - The specified type of :program:`mongod` process is removed from a
       :term:`replica set`.

   * - Host has restarted
     - |mms| detects that a host has been restarted.

   * - Host is recovering
     - A :term:`secondary` enters the :replstate:`RECOVERING` state. To
       learn more about the :replstate:`RECOVERING` state, see
       :manual:`Replica Set Member States </reference/replica-states>`.

   * - Host does not have the latest version
     - The revision of MongoDB running on a host is two or more revisions
       behind the current stable release of MongoDB.

       .. example::
          If the current stable release is MongoDB 3.2.9, a host running
          MongoDB 3.2.8 would not trigger an alert but a host running MongoDB
          version 3.2.7 would trigger an alert.

       For more information on MongoDB version numbering, see :ref:`MongoDB
       Version Numbers <release-version-numbers>` in the MongoDB manual.

   * - Host's SSL certificate will expire within 30 days
     - The SSL certificate for a MongoDB instance is 30 days from expiration.
       |mms| resends the alert every 24 hours until resolved or acknowledged.
       If you do not resolve or acknowledge the alert and the certificate
       expires, |mms| continues to send the alert. If the certificate expires,
       the Monitoring Agent can no longer connect to the MongoDB instance.

   MongoDB reports on the Replication Oplog using the
   ``metrics.operation.scanAndOrder`` document that the
   :manual:`serverStatus </reference/command/serverStatus>`
   command returns.

Operations metrics include:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Metric
     - Alert Trigger

   * - Operations: Scan and Order is
     - The average rate per second over your specified threshold of queries
       that return sorted results that cannot perform the sort operation using
       an index.

DB Storage
``````````

You may set alerts for the amount of data storage used. Database storage
metrics include:

.. list-table::

   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Metric
     - Alert Trigger

   * - DB Storage is
     - The amount of on-disk storage space used by extents meets your
       specified threshold.

   * - DB Data Size is
     - The actual data size in the database meets your specified threshold.

.. admonition:: How It Is Measured
   :class: note

   MongoDB reports on WiredTiger using the :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.cache`
   and :serverstatus:`wiredTiger.concurrentTransactions` documents that the
   :manual:`serverStatus </reference/command/serverStatus>` command returns.

WiredTiger storage engine conditions include:

       This is time for which the kernel cannot otherwise account.

   * - System: CPU (User) % is
     - The normalized CPU usage of the MongoDB process, which is scaled to a
       range of 0-100%.

   * - Disk space % used on Data Partition is
     - The percentage of disk space used on any partition that contains the

Replica Set Alerts
------------------

You may set alerts about the status of the :term:`primary` and the number of
healthy members in a :term:`replica set`. Replica set conditions include:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Condition
     - Alert Trigger

   * - Replica set elected a new primary
     - A set elects a new :term:`primary`. Each time |mms| receives a ping, it
       inspects the output of the replica set's :manual:`rs.status()
       </reference/method/rs.status>` method for the status of each replica
       set member. From this output, |mms| determines which replica set member
       is the primary. If the primary found in the ping data is different than
       the current primary known to |mms|, this alert triggers.

       Receiving this alert does not always mean that the set elected a *new*
       primary. This alert may also trigger when the same primary is re-
       elected. This can happen when |mms| processes a ping in the midst of an
       election.

   * - Replica set has no primary
     - A replica set does not have a :term:`primary`. Specifically, when none
       of the members of a replica set have a status of ``PRIMARY``, the alert
       triggers. For example, this condition may arise when a set has an even
       number of voting members resulting in a tie.

       If the Monitoring Agent collects data during an :manual:`election for
       primary </core/replica-set-elections>`, this alert might send a false
       positive. To prevent such false positives, set the alert
       configuration's :guilabel:`after waiting` interval (in the
       configuration's :guilabel:`Send to` section).

       For resolutions, see :doc:`/reference/alerts/no-primary`.

Replica set metrics include:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Metric
     - Alert Trigger

   * - Number of healthy members is
     - A replica set has fewer healthy members than your specified threshold.

   * - Number of unhealthy members is
     - A replica set has more unhealthy members than your specified threshold.

Sharded Cluster Alerts
----------------------

You may set an alert for a ``mongos`` missing from a :term:`sharded cluster`.
Sharded cluster conditions include:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Condition
     - Alert Trigger

   * - Cluster is missing an active mongos
     - |mms| cannot reach a :program:`mongos` for the cluster.

Agent Alerts
------------

You may set alerts for agent status or versioning. Agent conditions include:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Condition
     - Alert Trigger

   * - Automation Agent is down
     - No Automation Agent is detected for at least 1 minute. Under normal
       operation, the Automation Agent sends a ping to |mms| roughly once
       every 10 seconds. If |mms| does not receive a ping for at least 1
       minute, this alert triggers. However, this alert never triggers for a
       project that has no managed hosts or managed agents configured.

   * - Monitoring Agent is down
     - No Monitoring Agent is detected for at least 7 minutes. Under normal
       operation, the Monitoring Agent sends a ping to |mms| roughly once per
       minute. If |mms| does not receive a ping for at least 7 minutes, this
       alert triggers. However, this alert never triggers for a project that
       has no hosts configured.

       .. important::
          When the Monitoring Agent is down, |mms| triggers no other alerts
          for any host. For example: if a host is down there is no Monitoring
          Agent to send data to |mms| that could trigger new alerts.

   * - Monitoring Agent does not have the latest version
     - The Monitoring Agent is not running the latest version of the software.

   * - Backup Agent is down
     - The Backup Agent for a project with at least one active replica set or
       cluster is down for more than 1 hour.

       To resolve this alert:

       #. To see which host serves the Backup Agent,
          click :guilabel:`Deployment`, then the :guilabel:`Servers` tab.

       #. Check the Backup Agent log file on that host.

   * - Backup Agent does not have the latest version
     - The Backup Agent is not running the latest version of the software.

Backup Alerts
-------------

You may set alerts for backup oplog, resync and inconsistencies. Backup
conditions include:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Condition
     - Alert Trigger

   * - Backup oplog is behind
     - The most recent :term:`oplog` data received by |mms| is more than 75
       minutes old.

       To resolve this alert, see
       :doc:`/reference/alerts/backup-oplog-is-behind`.

   * - Backup requires a resync
     - The replication process for a backup falls too far behind the
       :term:`oplog` to catch up. This occurs when the host overwrites oplog
       entries that backup has not yet replicated. When this happens, you must
       resync backup, as described in the procedure
       :doc:`/tutorial/resync-backup`.

       Also, check the corresponding Backup Agent log. If you see a "Failed
       Common Points" test, one of the following may have happened.

       - A significant rollback event occurred on the backed-up replica set.

       - The :manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>` for the backed-up
         replica set was resized or deleted.

       - High oplog churn caused the agent to lose the tail of the oplog.

   * - Inconsistent backup configuration has been detected
     - |mms| has detected that the configuration for a backup does not match
       the configuration of the MongoDB deployment it backs up.

       To resolve this alert, see :doc:`/reference/alerts/inconsistent-backup`.

   * - Inconsistent cluster snapshot count is...
     - |mms| fails a consecutive number of times to successfully take a
       cluster snapshot. This alert is triggered when the number of attempts
       meets your specified threshold.

       The alert text may contain the reason for the problem. Common
       problems include:

       - There was no reachable :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos>`.
         To resolve this issue, ensure that there is at least one
         :program:`mongos` showing on the |mms| :guilabel:`Deployment` page.

       - The :manual:`balancer </core/sharding-balancing>` could not be
         stopped. To resolve this issue, check the log files for the first
         :manual:`config server </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>` to
         determine why the balancer will not stop.

       - Could not insert a token in one or more :manual:`shards
         </core/sharded-cluster-shards>`. To resolve this issue, ensure
         connectivity between the Backup Agent and all shards.
