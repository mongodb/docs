Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to configure **monitoring** in {+driver-short+}
by using {+driver-short+}'s callback-based interface. Monitoring is the process of
gathering information about your application's behavior as it runs.
This information can help you make informed decisions when designing and debugging your application.
You can also use information from monitoring events to track your application's performance
and resource usage.

The driver provides information about your application by emitting events. You can
listen for driver events to monitor your application.

.. note:: Event Logging

   This page explains how to monitor your application in code. To learn how to record
   this information to an external log, see the :ref:`pymongo-logging` guide.

Event Types
-----------

The type of event that the driver emits depends on the operation being performed.
The following table describes the types of events that the driver emits:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Event Type
     - Description
   * - Command events
     - Events related to MongoDB database commands, such as ``find``, ``insert``,
       ``delete``, and ``count``. To learn how to use {+driver-short+} to run a
       database command, see :ref:`<pymongo-run-command>`. For more information about
       MongoDB database commands, see :manual:`Database Commands </reference/command/>`
       in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

       As a security measure, the driver redacts the contents of some
       command events. This protects the sensitive information contained in these command
       events.

   * - Server Discovery and Monitoring (SDAM) events
     - Events related to changes in the state of the MongoDB deployment.

   * - Connection Pool events
     - Events related to the connection pool held by the driver.

For a complete list of events the driver emits, see the
`pymongo.monitoring <{+api-root+}pymongo/monitoring.html>`__ API documentation.

Listening for Events
--------------------

To monitor an event, you must pass an event listener to your application's ``MongoClient``.
The following steps describe how to monitor your application by using an event listener:

1. Create a class that inherits from one of the event listener base classes
   provided by {+driver-short+}. The base class you choose depends on the type of event
   you want to monitor. For example, to monitor command events, create a class
   that inherits from ``CommandListener``.
#. Implement the methods of the base class that correpond to the events you want to monitor.
#. Pass an instance of your listener class to the ``MongoClient`` constructor.

The following code implements a ``CommandListener`` to listen for command events, a
``ServerListener`` to listen for SDAM events, and a ``ConnectionPoolListener`` to listen for
connection pool events:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring/monitoring.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: start-monitoring-listeners
   :end-before: end-monitoring-listeners
   :copyable: true

The following code passes instances of the preceding listeners to the ``MongoClient``
constructor. Select the :guilabel:`Synchronous` or :guilabel:`Asynchronous` tab to see the
corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring/monitoring.py
         :language: python
         :start-after: start-monitoring-client
         :end-before: end-monitoring-client
         :copyable: true

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: async
      
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring/monitoring.py
         :language: python
         :start-after: start-monitoring-client-async
         :end-before: end-monitoring-client-async
         :copyable: true
