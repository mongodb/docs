  You can add privileges in two ways:

      To give a role all the privileges of one or more existing roles,
      select the roles in the :guilabel:`Inherits From` field. The field
      provides a drop-down list that includes both :manual:`MongoDB
      built-in roles </reference/built-in-roles>` and any custom roles you
      have already created.
  - heading: "Add a privilege directly."
    pre: |
      To add specific privileges to the role, click :guilabel:`ADD
      PRIVILEGES FOR A RESOURCE`.

      In the :guilabel:`Resource` field, specify the resource to which to
      apply the role. Select the database from the drop-down menu.
      To specify the whole database, leave the field
      blank. To specify a collection, enter the collection name. If the
      resource is on the ``admin`` database, you can click
      :guilabel:`ADMIN` and apply the role outside the ``admin`` database.

      In the :guilabel:`Available Privileges` section, select the actions
      to apply. For a description of each action, see :manual:`Privilege
      Actions </reference/privilege-actions>` in the MongoDB manual.
