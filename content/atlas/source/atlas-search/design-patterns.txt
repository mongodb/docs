|fts| provides several methods to help you optimize queries
for different data models. Use the following tutorials to learn
common design patterns so you can effectively query your 
data with |fts|.

Query Non-String Fields with String-Specific Operators
------------------------------------------------------

Certain |fts| operators, like :ref:`queryString <querystring-ref>` 
and :ref:`autocomplete <autocomplete-ref>`, support only string fields. 
If you need to query non-string fields using these operators, 
you can convert the values of these fields to strings and store 
the converted fields in a :manual:`materialized view </core/materialized-views/>`. 
A materialized view lets you use string-specific operators to query 
the converted fields and keep the original data intact in the source collection.

To get started, see :ref:`query-nonstring-tutorial`.

Query Fields Inside Embedded Documents
--------------------------------------

You can use |fts| to query fields inside an array of documents,
even when the array of documents is nested.
After you index the document fields as the :ref:`embeddedDocuments
<bson-data-types-embedded-documents>` type, you can run queries against
the fields inside these documents, including fields inside the following 
types of arrays:

- Array of documents.
- Array of documents inside a document.
- Array of documents inside an array of documents.

To get started, see :ref:`embedded-documents-tutorial`.

Query Across Multiple Collections
---------------------------------

When your search must span multiple collections, you can use the 
following methods to search across them:

- To join collections and search across them, use the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage  
  with :pipeline:`$search`.
- To combine search results from multiple collections, use the :pipeline:`$unionWith` stage.
- To consolidate multiple collections so you can index and search them together,
  create a :manual:`materialized view </core/materialized-views/>`.

To get started, see :ref:`fts-cross-collection-tutorials`.
