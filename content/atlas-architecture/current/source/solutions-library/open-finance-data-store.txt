MongoDB powers open finance with flexible data integration,
built-in security, and scalable financial services.

- **Use cases:** `App Driven-Analytics`_

- **Industries:** `Financial Services`_

- **Products and tools:** :ref:`Aggregation Pipeline
  <aggregation-pipeline>`, `MongoDB Atlas`_

Solution Overview
-----------------

Open finance is transforming the financial industry, enabling
seamless data sharing across banks, fintech companies, and
third-party providers. However, the integration of diverse
financial data while ensuring security, compliance, and
scalability remains a major challenge. MongoDB provides a
foundation for open finance through its:

- Flexible document model

- Native JSON support

- Powerful aggregation framework

These features allow institutions to unify data from multiple
sources and ensure secure and compliant data management without
the complexity of traditional relational databases.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

This solution demonstrates a banking application that allows
users to securely connect external bank accounts.

#. The user initiates requests to connect their external bank
   accounts. This operation requires explicit user consent,
   ensuring security and compliance with regulations like PSD2.
   To authenticate, the application emulates {+oauth2+} and
   generates tokens to enable secure communication between
   institutions.

#. When authorized, the application uses APIs to communicate
   with external banks. These banks expose financial data such
   as accounts, transactions, and balances through their
   microservices. The responses are in JSON format, which
   ensures compatibility and seamless data exchange.

#. The application then pushes the financial data into
   |service-fullname|. With the document model, MongoDB lets you
   handle diverse data structures from different banks. The
   application can then use aggregation pipelines to analyze and
   enrich the data, giving users a holistic financial view while
   enabling the bank to offer personalized financial insights.

Data Model Approach
-------------------

In this solution, the data model emulates real-world financial
data integration. This approach leverages the flexibility of the
document model to handle diverse data structures from different
financial entities.

Components
~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Collection
     - Description

   * - ``tokens``
     - Stores Bearer tokens, which the application uses for
       authenticating and authorizing API requests with external
       banks.

       .. code-block:: javascript

          {
             "_id": { "$oid": "unique_id" }, 
             "UserName": "string", 
             "BearerToken": "string",
             "TokenDates": {
                "CreationDate": { "$date": "ISODate" }, 
                "LastUseDate": { "$date": "ISODate" }
             },
          }

   * - ``external_accounts``
     - Stores information on external bank accounts linked by
       users.

       .. code-block:: javascript
          
          {
             "_id": { "$oid": "unique_id" }, 
             "AccountId": "string", 
             "AccountBank": "string",
             "AccountStatus": "string", 
             "AccountType": "string", 
             "AccountBalance": "number",
             "AccountCurrency": "string", 
             "AccountDate": {
                "OpeningDate": { "$date": "ISODate" }
             }, 
             "AccountUser": {
                "UserName": "string", 
                "UserId": { "$oid": "unique_id" }
             },
             "GreenAccountNarrative": "string"
          }

   * - ``external_products``
     - Stores information on financial products (such as loans
       and mortgages) associated with users.

       .. code-block:: javascript

          {
             "_id": { "$oid": "unique_id" }, 
             "ProductId": "string", 
             "ProductBank": "string",
             "ProductStatus": "string", 
             "ProductType": "string", 
             "ProductAmount": "number",
             "ProductCurrency": "string", 
             "ProductInterestRate": "number", 
             "ProductDate": {
                "OpeningDate": { "$date": "ISODate" }
             }, 
             "ProductCustomer": {
                "UserName": "string", 
                "UserId": { "$oid": "unique_id" }
             }, 
             "GreenProductNarrative": "string", 
             "RepaymentPeriod": "number", 
             "LoanCollateral": "string"
          }

In real-world applications, these collections would involve more
complex security mechanisms and detailed information. Each
financial entity has its own data model definitions.

Data mapping and relationships
  The application needs a robust data mapping and
  relationship later to translate diverse data models from
  different financial entities to a unified format.

Security and compliance
  The application must ensure data security and compliance with
  regulations, such as GDPR, PSD2, and other local financial
  regulations. This includes encryption, access controls, and
  audit trails.

Scalability and performance 
  The application requires a data model that can handle large
  volumes of data efficiently with considerations for indexing,
  sharding, and performance optimization.

Integration and interoperability
  The application implements APIs and microservices that
  can integrate with various external systems, ensuring
  interoperability and real-time data exchange.

With the flexibility of the document model, this solution
demonstrates how financial institutions can unify and manage
diverse data sources. A production-grade implementation needs to address the complexities and nuances of real-world
financial data integration.

Solution Backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For details of the solution backend, see the Backend_ GitHub
repository. This repository provides the open finance demo
service. It shows how to integrate with third-party banks and
secure data exchange. MongoDB serves as the central data store.

To build the solution, complete the following steps: 

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Set up MongoDB database and collections

      Create a new database in |service-fullname| named
      ``open_finance``. Then add three collections:

      - ``tokens``
      - ``external_accounts``
      - ``external_products``

   .. step:: Import the sample data
   
      Import the sample data from the ``/backend/data/sample``
      directory into the respective collections.

   .. step:: Create a MongoDB user

      Create a new user with ``readWrite`` access to the
      ``open_finance`` database to manage data securely.

   .. step:: Configure environment variables

      Add the database credentials and API origins to a ``.env`` file.

   .. step:: Run the solution locally

      a. Set up a virtual environment using Poetry

      #. Install dependencies

      #. Start the backend with Uvicorn

      #. Ensure the service runs on the correct port for API
         communication
