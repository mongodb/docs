title: Get the MongoDB Connection URI String
ref: connection_string
level: 4
stepnum: 2
content: |
  
  In order to connect to MongoDB, you will need a :ref:`URI string <mongodb-uri>`. A
  ``URI`` (Uniform Resource Identifier) is similar to a URL, and is
  supplied as a parameter to the ``mongo`` shell, Compass, and the
  MongoDB drivers to connect to a MongoDB
  deployment.

  Atlas users can retrieve their URI strings from the Atlas web console.
  For information on how to do that, please see the
  :doc:`/guides/cloud/connectionstring` guide.

  .. note::

     The URI form below allows you to create a URI string for your
     session in MongoDB Guides  -- from either the connection string
     that Atlas provides, or by filling out the form for on-premises
     MongoDB instances. Once you provide the string or fill out the
     form, any relevant code examples within the MongoDB Guides will be
     populated with a URI string. You can change these at any time by
     repopulating the form.
  
  Use the fields below to create your URI string in MongoDB Guides and
  populate the code examples. 

  .. tip::
     
     Users of Compass should skip this step and load Compass directly
     with the URI String in the copy buffer (for Atlas), or by
     populating the ``New Connection`` form in Compass.

  .. warning::
     
     The $[password] will not be replaced in the string below, so you
     will need to replace the string with your password. Use caution
     where you store and enter passwords, particularly when running from
     a shell or command prompt. Special characters in passwords must be
     escaped.

  .. note:: If you are connecting to MongoDB in the cloud (Atlas), you'll need to
            add the ip address of the client you wish to use in the ip whitelist
            in your Atlas account. 
            
            For more details, see `Atlas documentation
            <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-whitelist/>`__.
