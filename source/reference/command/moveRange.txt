Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: moveRange

   .. versionadded:: 6.0

   Moves :term:`ranges <range>` between :term:`shards <shard>`. Run
   the :dbcommand:`moveRange` command with a :binary:`~bin.mongos` 
   instance while using the :term:`admin database`.
   
Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( 
     { 
       moveRange: <namespace>,
       toShard: <ID of the recipient shard>,
       min: <min key of the range to move>, // conditional
       max: <max key of the range to move>, // conditional
       forceJumbo: <bool>, // optional
       waitForDelete: <bool>, // optional
       writeConcern: <write concern>, // optional
       secondaryThrottle: <bool> // optional
     } 
   )

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``toShard``
     - string
     - ID of the recipient shard.

   * - ``min``
     - key
     - Minimum key of the range to move. Required if you don't specify
       ``max``.

       If you do not specify ``min``, given a chunk ``C`` where ``max``
       is either the exclusive upper bound of ``C`` or ``C`` includes
       the shard key ``max``, ``min`` is determined in the following
       way:

       - If the data size of the range between ``min(C)`` and ``max`` 
         is less than the per-collection chunk size or the default 
         chunk size, the chunk's ``min`` value is selected as 
         ``min`` = ``min(C)``.

       - Otherwise, key ``min`` > ``min(C)`` where ``min`` depends 
         on the configured chunk size.

   * - ``max``
     - key
     - Maximum key of the range to move. Required if you don't specify
       ``min``.
       
       If you do not specify 
       ``max``, given a chunk ``C`` including the shard key ``min``, 
       ``max`` is determined in the following way:

       - If the data size of the range between ``min`` and ``max(C)`` 
         is less than the per-collection chunk size or the default 
         chunk size, the chunk's max is selected as 
         ``max`` = ``max(C)``.

       - Otherwise, key ``max`` < ``max(C)`` where ``max`` depends 
         on the configured chunk size.

   * - :ref:`forceJumbo <moverange-forceJumbo>`
     - boolean
     - .. _moverange-forceJumbo:
    
       Optional. 

       Flag that determines if the command can move a range that is 
       :ref:`too large to migrate <migration-chunk-size-limit>`. The 
       range may or may not be labeled as :ref:`jumbo <jumbo-chunk>`.

       - If ``true``, the command can move the range.
       - If ``false``, the command cannot move the range.

       The default is ``false``.

   * - ``writeConcern``
     - document
     - Optional. 

       Document with the :ref:`write concern <write-concern>`.

       The default is :writeconcern:`w: majority <"majority">`.

   * - ``secondaryThrottle``
     - boolean
     - Optional. 

       - If ``true``, each document move during chunk migration 
         propagates to at least one secondary before the balancer 
         proceeds with the next document. This is equivalent to a write 
         concern of :writeconcern:`{ w: 2 } <\<number\>>`. 
          
         Use the ``writeConcern`` option to specify a different write 
         concern.
          
       - If ``false``, the balancer does not wait for replication to a
         secondary and instead continues with the next document.

       For more information, see
       :ref:`sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle`.
       
The :ref:`range migration <sharding-chunk-migration>` section
describes how ranges move between shards on MongoDB.

Considerations
--------------

Only use the :dbcommand:`moveRange` in scenarios like:

- an initial ingestion of data
- a large bulk import operation  

Allow the balancer to create and balance ranges in sharded clusters in
most cases.

Examples
--------

The following examples use a collection with:

- Shard key ``x``
- Configured chunk size of 128MB
- A chunk with boundaries: ``[x: 0, x: 100)``

Specify both ``min`` and ``max``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table lists the results of setting ``min`` and ``max``
to various values:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - ``min``
     - ``max``
     - Result

   * - ``0``
     - ``100``
     - Moves all the documents in the range to the recipient shard.

   * - ``10``
     - ``30``
     - Creates three sub-ranges: 

       - ``[x: 0, x: 10)``
       - ``[x: 10, x: 30)`` 
       - ``[x: 30, x: 100)``

       Moves all the documents in ``[x: 10, x: 30)`` to the recipient
       shard.

   * - ``0``
     - ``20`` 
     - Creates two sub-ranges:

       - ``[x: 0, x: 20)``
       - ``[x: 20, x: 100)``
       
       Moves all the documents in ``[x: 0, x: 20)`` to the recipient
       shard.
   
   * - ``40``
     - ``100``
     - Creates two sub-ranges:

       - ``[x: 0, x: 40)``
       - ``[x: 40, x: 100)``

       Moves all the documents in ``[x: 40, x: 100)`` to the recipient
       shard.
