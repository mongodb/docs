Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about how the Go Driver handles conversions
between BSON and Go objects. The process of converting a Go object to
BSON is called **marshalling**, while the reverse process is called **unmarshalling**. 

You should read this guide if you want to learn more about how the Go Driver
represents BSON data or need to adjust default marshalling
and unmarshalling behaviors.

Data Types
----------

MongoDB stores documents in a binary representation called :manual:`BSON
</reference/bson-types/>` that allows for easy and flexible data processing. The Go
Driver represents BSON data using two families of types: ``D`` and ``Raw``.

The ``D`` family contains four types:

- ``D``: An ordered representation of a BSON document (slice)
- ``M``: An unordered representation of a BSON document (map)
- ``A``: An ordered representation of a BSON array
- ``E``: A single element inside a D type

Of these, you can use the ``D`` and ``M`` types to
build representations of BSON using native Go types. 

The following example demonstrates how to construct a query filter using the
``bson.D`` type to match documents with a ``quantity`` field value greater
than 100:

.. code-block:: go
   
   filter := bson.D{{"quantity", bson.D{{"$gt", 100}}}}

You can use ``Raw`` types to validate and retrieve elements from a slice
of bytes, which is useful if you don't want to unmarshal BSON into
another type. 

In Go, a **struct** is a collection of data fields with declared data
types. The Go Driver can marshal/unmarshal structs and other native Go
types to/from BSON using a `configurable codec system <https://pkg.go.dev/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson/bsoncodec>`_.

For more information on how the Go Driver handles BSON data, see the
`bson package API documentation
<https://pkg.go.dev/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson>`_.

Struct Tags
-----------

You can modify the default marshalling and unmarshalling behavior of the Go Driver using
**struct tags**, which are optional pieces of metadata attached to
struct fields. The most common use of struct tags is for specifying the
field name in the BSON document that corresponds to the struct field.
The following table describes the additional struct tags that you can
use with the Go Driver:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Struct Tag
     - Description

   * - ``omitempty``
     - The field will not be marshalled if it is set to the zero value
       corresponding to the field type.

   * - ``minsize``
     - If the field type is type int64, uint, uint32, or uint64 and the value of
       the field can fit in a signed int32, the field will be serialized
       as a BSON int32 rather than a BSON int64. If the value can't fit
       in a signed int32, this tag is ignored.

   * - ``truncate``
     - If the field type is a non-float numeric type, BSON doubles
       unmarshalled into that field will be trucated at the decimal point.

   * - ``inline``
     - If the field type is a struct or map field, the field will be
       "flattened" when marshalling and "un-flattened" when unmarshalling.

Without additional instruction from struct tags, the Go
Driver will marshal structs using the following rules:

#. The Go Driver only marshals and unmarshals exported fields.

#. The Go Driver generates BSON key using the lowercase of the
   corresponding struct field.

#. The Go Driver marshals embedded struct fields as subdocuments.
   Each key is the lowercase of the field's type.

#. The Go Driver marshals a pointer field as the underlying type if the
   pointer is non-nil. If the pointer is nil, the driver marshals it as a BSON null
   value.

#. When unmarshalling, the Go Driver follows `these D/M type mappings
   <https://pkg.go.dev/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson#hdr-Native_Go_Types>`_
   for fields of type ``interface{}``. The driver unmarshals BSON documents
   unmarshalled into an ``interface{}`` field as a ``D`` type.

   .. tab:: Struct Tags
      :tabid: struct-tags

      The following example demonstrates how the Go Driver marshals a
      struct with various struct tags:

      .. code-block:: go

         type Address struct {
         	Street string
         	City   string
         	State  string
         }
                  
         type Student struct {
         	FirstName string  `bson:"first_name,omitempty"`
         	LastName  string  `bson:"last_name,omitempty"`
         	Address   Address `bson:"inline"`
         	Age       int
         }
         ...

         coll := client.Database("school").Collection("students")
         address1 := Address{ "1 Lakewood Way", "Elwood City", "PA" }
         student1 := Student{ FirstName : "Arthur", Address : address1, Age : 8}
         _, err = coll.InsertOne(context.TODO(), student1)

      The corresponding BSON representation looks like this:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false
      
         { 
           "_id" : ObjectId("..."),
           "first_name" : "Arthur",
           "street" : "1 Lakewood Way",
           "city" : "Elwood City",
           "state" : "PA",
           "age" : 8
         }

      In this example, struct tags make the driver:
      
      - Set custom BSON field names such as ``first_name``
      - Omit the empty ``LastName`` field
      - Flatten the nested struct and bring all fields up to the top
        level

      .. tabs::

   .. tab:: No Struct Tags
      :tabid: no-struct-tags

      The following example demonstrates how the Go Driver marshals a
      struct without any struct tags:

      .. code-block:: go

         type Address struct {
         	Street string
         	City   string
         	State  string
         }
                  
         type Student struct {
         	FirstName string
         	LastName  string
         	Address   Address
         	Age       int
         }
         ...

         coll := client.Database("school").Collection("students")
         address1 := Address{ "1 Lakewood Way", "Elwood City", "PA" }
         student1 := Student{ FirstName : "Arthur", Address : address1, Age : 8}
         _, err = coll.InsertOne(context.TODO(), student1)

      The corresponding BSON representation looks like this:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false
      
         { 
           "_id" : ObjectId("..."),
           "firstname" : "Arthur",
           "lastname" : "",
           "address": {
                        "street" : "1 Lakewood Way",
                        "city" : "Elwood City",
                        "state" : "PA"
                      },
           "age" : 8
         }
         
      Without struct tags, the driver:
      
      - Sets the lowercase of the struct fields as the BSON field names
      - Includes an empty ``lastname`` field
      - Stores the ``Address`` field as a nested object

Unmarshalling
-------------

You can unmarshal BSON documents using the ``Decode()`` method. When you
execute either a ``FindOne()`` or ``Find()`` query, you can use the
``Decode()`` method on the return object to unmarshal the results.

The ``Decode()`` method returns an ``error`` interface type which
contains one of the following values:

- ``nil`` if a document matched your query, and there were no errors
  retrieving and unmarshalling the document. 
- If the driver retrieved your document but could not unmarshal your result, the
  ``Decode()`` method returns the unmarshalling error.
- If there was an error retrieving your document during execution of the
  ``FindOne()`` method, the error propagates to the ``Decode()`` method and
  the ``Decode()`` method returns the error. 

When used on the ``SingleResult`` type returned by the ``FindOne()``
method, ``Decode()`` can also return the ``ErrNoDocuments`` error if no
documents matched the query filter.

The following example demonstrates how you can use the ``Decode()``
method to unmarshal and read the result of a simple ``FindOne()``
operation:

.. code-block:: go
   
   myCollection := client.Database("school").Collection("students")
   filter := bson.D{{"age", 8}}

   var result bson.D
   cursor := myCollection.FindOne(context.TODO(), filter)
   err = cursor.Decode(&result)
   ...

   fmt.Println(result)

The output of the preceding code should look like this:

.. code-block:: none
   
   [{_id ObjectID("...")} {first_name Arthur} {street 1 Fern Way} {city Elwood City} {state PA} {age 8}]

The ``Cursor`` type also uses the ``All()`` method, which unmarshals all
documents stored in the cursor into an array at the same time.

The ``bson`` package includes a family of
``Marshal()`` and ``Unmarshal()`` methods that work with BSON-encoded data
of ``[]byte`` type. 

The following code demonstrates how you can unmarshal BSON back into a
user-defined struct by using methods from the ``bson`` package:

.. code-block:: go
   
   type Item struct {
      Category string
      Quantity int32
   }
   ...

   doc, err := bson.Marshal(bson.D{{"category", "plate"}, {"quantity", 6}})
   ...
   var test Item
   err = bson.Unmarshal(doc, &test)
   ...
   fmt.Printf("Unmarshalled Struct:\n%+v\n", test)

The output of the preceding code should look like this:

.. code-block:: none
   
   Unmarshalled Struct:
   {Category:plate Quantity:6}
