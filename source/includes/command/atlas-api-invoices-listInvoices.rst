`experimental <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/current/command/atlas-api/>`_: Returns all invoices that MongoDB issued to the specified organization.

This list includes all invoices regardless of invoice status. To use this resource, the requesting API Key must have the Organization Billing Viewer, Organization Billing Admin, or Organization Owner role. If you have a cross-organization setup, you can view linked invoices if you have the Organization Billing Admin or Organization Owner role.
To compute the total owed amount of the invoices - sum up total owed of each invoice. It could be computed as a sum of owed amount of each payment included into the invoice. To compute payment's owed amount - use formula totalBilledCents * unitPrice + salesTax - startingBalanceCents.

This command is autogenerated and corresponds 1:1 with the Atlas API endpoint https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Invoices/operation/listInvoices.

For more information and examples, see the referenced API documentation linked above.
