Install MongoDB Community Edition
---------------------------------

.. _install-community-debian-pkg:

Using ``.deb`` Packages (Recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/important-dont-use-distro-packages.rst

The Debian package management tools (i.e. ``dpkg`` and ``apt``) ensure
package consistency and authenticity by requiring that distributors
sign packages with GPG keys.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-mongodb-on-debian.rst

Using ``.tgz`` Tarballs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   The recommended procedure to install is through the :ref:`package
   manager <install-community-debian-pkg>`. However, as an alternative,
   you can install by downloading the ``.tgz`` tarballs directly.
