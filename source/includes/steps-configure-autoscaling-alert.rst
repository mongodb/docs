      #. In the :guilabel:`Condition/Metric`, select one of the following conditions.

         You can configure the following auto-scaling alerts:

         - :alert:`Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling initiated for base tier <Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling initiated for base tier>`
         - :alert:`Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling initiated for analytics tier <Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling initiated for analytics tier>`
         - :alert:`Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling down didn't initiate for base tier due to storage requirements <Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling down didn't initiate for base tier due to storage requirements>`
         - :alert:`Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling down didn't initiate for analytics tier due to storage requirements <Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling down didn't initiate for analytics tier due to storage requirements>`
         - :alert:`Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling didn't initiate for base tier due to maximum configured cluster tier <Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling didn't initiate for base tier due to maximum configured cluster tier>`
         - :alert:`Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling didn't initiate for analytics tier due to maximum configured cluster tier <Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling didn't initiate for analytics tier due to maximum configured cluster tier>`
         - :alert:`Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling didn't initiate for base tier due to insufficient oplog size <Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling didn't initiate for base tier due to insufficient oplog size>`
         - :alert:`Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling didn't initiate for analytics tier due to insufficient oplog size <Auto-scaling: Compute auto-scaling didn't initiate for analytics tier due to insufficient oplog size>`
         - :alert:`Auto-scaling: Disk auto-scaling initiated <Auto-scaling: Disk auto-scaling initiated>`
         - :alert:`Auto-scaling: Disk auto-scaling didn't initiate due to the cluster reaching maximum available disk size <Auto-scaling: Disk auto-scaling didn't initiate due to the cluster reaching maximum available disk size>`
         - :alert:`Auto-scaling: Disk auto-scaling didn't initiate due to insufficient oplog size <Auto-scaling: Disk auto-scaling didn't initiate due to insufficient oplog size>`

         For the alert you want to configure, click :icon:`ellipsis-h` then
         :guilabel:`Edit` in that alert setting's row.

   .. step:: Select the alert recipients and delivery methods.
