You can download logs of your {+fdi+} queries from the {+atlas-cli+}, {+atlas-ui+}, and |api|. You can view the logs to determine information such as:

- The number and type of executed queries.
- The number of scanned documents.

The log is in JSON format and available as a ``.gz`` file. {+adf+} 
retains the logs for up to 30 days. By default, the logs are generated 
in |utc| format. You can modify the time zone in the :guilabel:`User 
Preferences` page to generate and download the logs in your time zone. 
You can generate logs for: 

- The last four, eight, twelve, or twenty-four hours.
- A specific date and time period.

.. note::

   It might take up to an hour for query log entries to be available 
   to download in |service|.
