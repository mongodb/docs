Quickly try |fts| with the `{+playground+} <https://search-playground.mongodb.com/>`__. 
You can try different |fts| features by configuring search indexes and running 
queries without needing an |service| account, {+cluster+}, or collection. 
You can also share a link to a snapshot of your {+playground+} with others.

.. _stages-fts-playground:

Supported Stages
----------------

The {+playground+} supports a subset of aggregation pipeline stages, including:

* :pipeline:`$search`
* :pipeline:`$searchMeta`
* :pipeline:`$project`
* :pipeline:`$limit`
* :pipeline:`$skip`
* :pipeline:`$facet`

Considerations 
--------------

MongoDB logs your workload data for monitoring the system health and to
help troubleshoot any issues in the {+playground+}.

.. _fts-playground-limitations:

Search Playground Limitations
-----------------------------

- The {+playground+} only supports a single collection. You can't use :pipeline:`$lookup` or 
  :pipeline:`$unionWith` to :ref:`search multiple collections <fts-cross-collection-tutorials>`.

- The {+playground+} environment does not persist. To save an
  environment, use the :guilabel:`Share` button to generate a snapshot
  |url| that lasts 30 days. The snapshot functionality is only available
  for the :guilabel:`Code Sandbox` tool.

- The {+playground+} has the following data limitations:
  
  - You can't add more than 500 documents to the {+playground+}.

  - You can't import files larger than 100 KB.

  - Your total data in the {+playground+}, including the collection, search index, synonyms, 
    and queries, can't exceed 300 KB.

- The {+playground+} doesn't support indexing fields as the :ref:`vector
  <bson-data-types-vector>` type and running queries using the
  :ref:`vectorSearch <fts-vectorSearch-ref>` operator.

- The {+playground+} is not connected to your clusters. However, you can 
  recreate your |service| environment in the {+playground+} by:

  1. :dbtools:`Exporting documents </mongoexport>` from |service| and importing 
     into the {+playground+}.
  #. Copying the |fts| index from your |service| :guilabel:`JSON Editor` and pasting 
     into the :guilabel:`Index` panel in the {+playground+}.

Try the {+playground+}
---------------------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Access the {+playground+}.

      Navigate to `https://search-playground.mongodb.com/
      <https://search-playground.mongodb.com/>`__.
   
   .. step:: Choose your tool.

      The {+playground+} provides a |json|-only and visual way to
      explore |fts| features. 

      .. list-table:: 
         :widths: 20 80 

         * - :guilabel:`Code Sandbox`
           - Provides a way to add your own data, define a |fts| index in
             |json| format, and construct and run :pipeline:`$search`
             and :pipeline:`$searchMeta` queries in |json| format. This
             playground also includes several templates to get you
             started with |fts|. 

             You can also save and share your playground with others.
             This allows anyone to interact with your playground
             snapshot for up to 30 days. Any changes made after
             generating the playground URL won't affect the original
             snapshot. 

         * - :guilabel:`Search Demo Builder`
           - Provides a visual way to explore the following |fts|
             features and query the data. 

             - Fields to index
             - Search-as-you-type (autocomplete)
             - Filters and facets

             The tool automatically generates your index definition and
             query syntax that you can copy and use in your |service|
             {+cluster+}. 
        
         * - :guilabel:`Chatbot Demo Builder`
           - Provides a way to try a RAG chatbot that answers your questions using 
             MongoDB Vector Search. Try the chatbot with your own data or by using 
             the sample data. To learn more, visit 
             :ref:`Chatbot Demo Builder <avs-playground>`. 

      Sample data is pre-loaded by default in the :guilabel:`Code Sandbox` and
      :guilabel:`Search Demo Builder`. Alternatively, you can upload your own
      data.  

.. note::

   The {+playground+} performance might differ from production performance.

Try the Examples in the {+playground+}
