Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+driver-short+} to store
and interact with **time series data**.

Time series data is composed of the following components:

- Measured quantity
- Timestamp for the measurement
- Metadata that describes the measurement

The following table describes sample situations for which you could store time
series data:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33, 33, 33
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Situation
     - Measured Quantity
     - Metadata

   * - Recording monthly sales by industry
     - Revenue in USD
     - Company, country

   * - Tracking weather changes
     - Precipitation level
     - Location, sensor type

   * - Recording fluctuations in housing prices
     - Monthly rent price
     - Location, currency

.. _ruby-time-series-create:

Create a Time Series Collection
-------------------------------

.. important:: Server Version for Time Series Collections

   To create and interact with time series collections, you must be
   connected to a deployment running {+mdb-server+} 5.0 or later.

To create a time series collection, you must pass an options hash that contains
the specifications for the collection. You can specify the following specifications
for your time series collection:

- ``:timeField``: Specifies the field that stores a timestamp in each time series
  document.
- ``:metaField``: Specifies the field that stores metadata in each time series 
  document.
- ``:granularity``: Specifies the approximate time between consecutive timestamps.
  The possible values are ``'seconds'``, ``'minutes'``, and ``'hours'``.
- ``:bucketMaxSpanSeconds``: Sets the maximum time between timestamps in the 
  same bucket.
- ``:bucketRoundingSeconds``: Sets the number of seconds to round down by when 
  MongoDB sets the minimum timestamp for a new bucket. Must be equal to 
  ``:bucketMaxSpanSeconds``.

See :manual:`Command Fields </reference/command/create/#command-fields>`
in the {+mdb-server+} manual entry on the ``create`` command to learn more about
these parameters. 

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``Collection#create`` method to create a time series
collection named ``october2024`` with the ``:timeField``` option set to ``"timestamp"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/time-series.rb
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-create
   :end-before: end-create

To verify that you have successfully created the collection, print a list of all
collections in your database and filter by collection name, as shown in the following
code:

.. io-code-block::

    .. input:: /includes/usage-examples/time-series.rb
       :language: ruby
       :start-after: start-correct
       :end-before: end-correct
       :dedent:

    .. output::
       :language: json
       :visible: false

       [
         {
           "name": "october2024", 
           "type": "timeseries", 
           "options": {
             "timeseries": { 
               "timeField": "timestamp",
               "granularity": "seconds", 
               "bucketMaxSpanSeconds": 3600 
          }
          }, 
           "info": {
             "readOnly": false
           }
          }
        ]


.. _ruby-time-series-write:

Store Time Series Data
----------------------

You can insert data into a time series collection by using the ``insert_one``
or ``insert_many`` method and specifying the measurement, timestamp, and 
metadata in each inserted document.

To learn more about inserting documents, see the :ref:`ruby-write-insert` guide.

Example
~~~~~~~

This example inserts New York City temperature data into the ``october2024``
time series collection created in the preceding :ref:`ruby-time-series-create`
section. Each document contains the following fields:

- ``temperature``, which stores temperature measurements in degrees Fahrenheit
- ``location``, which stores location metadata
- ``timestamp``, which stores the measurement timestamp

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/time-series.rb
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-insert
   :end-before: end-insert

    .. To learn more about using ``datetime`` objects in {+driver-short+}, see 
    .. :ref:`ruby-dates-times`.

.. _ruby-time-series-read:

Query Time Series Data
----------------------

You can use the same syntax and conventions to query data stored in a time 
series collection as you use when performing read or aggregation operations on 
other collections. To learn more about these operations, see the following
guides:

- :ref:`ruby-read`
- :ref:`ruby-aggregation`
