Compiled versions of MongoDB for Linux provide a simple option for
installing MongoDB for other Linux systems without supported packages.

Installation Process
--------------------

MongoDB provides archives for both 64-bit and 32-bit Linux. Follow the
installation procedure appropriate for your system.

Install for 64-bit Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-on-linux-64.rst

Install for 32-bit Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-on-linux-32.rst

Run MongoDB
-----------

Set Up the Data Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. start-include-for-enterprise-tutorial

Before you start :binary:`~bin.mongod` for the first time, you will need
to create the data directory (i.e. :setting:`dbpath`). By default, :binary:`~bin.mongod` writes
data to the ``/data/db`` directory.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-set-up-dbpath.rst

You can specify an alternate path for data files using the
:option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option to :binary:`~bin.mongod`. If
you use an alternate location for your data directory, ensure that this
user can write to the alternate data directory.

Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start :binary:`~bin.mongod`, run the executable :binary:`~bin.mongod` at the
system prompt.

For example, if your ``PATH`` includes the location of the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` binary, enter ``mongod`` at the system prompt.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod

If your ``PATH`` does not include the location of the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
binary, enter the full path to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary.

Starting :binary:`~bin.mongod` without any arguments starts a MongoDB
instance that writes data to the ``/data/db`` directory. To specify an
alternate data directory, start :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the
:option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --dbpath <some alternate directory>

Whether using the default :file:`/data/db` or an alternate directory,
ensure that the user account running :binary:`~bin.mongod` has read and
write permissions to the directory.

Stop MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To stop the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, press ``Control+C`` in the
terminal where the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is running.
