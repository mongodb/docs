  This is a unique connection string specific to your |service|

  string with the username of the database user you created earlier

  You will be prompted to enter the password you specified when you
  created your database user in |service|.

  You should now be connected to your |service| cluster within the
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. Your terminal should display something
  similar to the following:

  .. code-block:: none
     :copyable: false

     MongoDB Enterprise GettingStarted-shard-0:PRIMARY>

  .. important:: Connection Troubleshooting

     If you are having trouble connecting to your cluster, double check
     that you have added your IP address to your :ref:`IP access list
     <gswa-access-list>` and that you are specifying the correct
     :ref:`database user credentials <gswa-user>`. If you have
     forgotten your database user credentials, you can always
     :ref:`create a new database user <mongodb-users>`.
