You can manage the |aws| IAM roles |service| uses to access AWS services
with the |service| UI and :ref:`API <cloud-provider-access-api-ref>`.

To navigate to the |service| :guilabel:`AWS IAM Role Access` screen:

1. Expand the :guilabel:`Options` menu next to your project name
   in the |service| UI upper left corner. Select :guilabel:`Integrations`.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Configure` button in the :guilabel:`AWS IAM
   Role Access` panel.

   Note: if you already have one or more roles configured, the button
   reads :guilabel:`Edit`.

You can perform the following actions from the |service| :guilabel:`AWS
IAM Role Access` screen:

- **View the list of authorized AWS IAM roles.**

  The list of roles displays the role's |arn|, its time of creation, and
  any |service| services configured to use the role.

- **Authorize an AWS IAM role.**

  Click the :guilabel:`Authorize an AWS IAM Role` button.

  .. note:: 
  
     If you have an authorization in progress, the associated role has
     a :guilabel:`Resume` button next to it.

  For detailed instructions, see :ref:`set-up-unified-aws-access`.

- **Deauthorize an AWS IAM role.**

  Click the :guilabel:`Delete` button next to the role.

  .. note::

     Be sure to remove any associated |service| services from the IAM role
     before you deauthorize it.

- **View the details of an AWS IAM role.**

  Click the ellipsis (:guilabel:`...`) icon next to the role and select
  :guilabel:`View Role Details`.
