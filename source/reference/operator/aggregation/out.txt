.. pipeline:: $out

   Takes the documents returned by the aggregation pipeline and writes
   them to a specified collection. Starting in MongoDB 4.4, you can
   specify the output database.

   The :pipeline:`$out` stage must be *the last stage* in the
   pipeline. The :pipeline:`$out` operator lets the aggregation
   framework return result sets of any size.

Syntax
------

The :pipeline:`$out` stage has the following syntax:

- Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :pipeline:`$out` can take a document to
  specify the output database as well as the output collection:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { $out: { db: "<output-db>", coll: "<output-collection>" } }

  .. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 15 85

    * - Field
      - Description

    * - :ref:`db <out-db>`
      - ..  _out-db:

        The output database name.
      
        - For a :ref:`replica set <replica-set>` or a standalone, if the
          output database does not exist, :pipeline:`$out` also creates
          the database.

        - For a :ref:`sharded cluster <sharded-cluster>`, the specified
          output database must already exist.

    * - :ref:`coll <out-collection>`
      - ..  _out-collection:

        The output collection name.

- :pipeline:`$out` can take a string to specify only the output
  collection (i.e. output to a collection in the same database):

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { $out: "<output-collection>" } // Output collection is in the same database

.. important::

   - You cannot specify a sharded collection as the output
     collection. The input collection for a pipeline can be sharded.
     To output to a sharded collection, see :pipeline:`$merge`
     (Available starting in MongoDB 4.2).
   - The :pipeline:`$out` operator cannot write results to a
     :doc:`capped collection </core/capped-collections>`.
   - If you modify a collection with an :atlas:`Atlas Search
     </atlas-search>` index, you must first delete and then re-create
     the search index. Consider using :pipeline:`$merge` instead.

Comparison with ``$merge``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the introduction of :pipeline:`$merge` in version 4.2, MongoDB
provides two stages, :pipeline:`$merge` and :pipeline:`$out`, for
writing the results of the aggregation pipeline to a collection. The
following summarizes the capabilities of the two stages:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - :pipeline:`$out`
     - :pipeline:`$merge`
   * - - Can output to a collection in the same or, starting in
         MongoDB 4.4, different database.
     - - Can output to a collection in the same or different database.
   * - - Creates a new collection if the output collection does not
         already exist.
     - - Creates a new collection if the output collection does not
         already exist.
   * - - Replaces the output collection completely if it already exists.
     - - Can incorporate results (insert new documents, merge
         documents, replace documents, keep existing documents, fail
         the operation, process documents with a custom update pipeline) into
         an existing collection.

         Can replace the content of the collection but only if the
         aggregation results contain a match for all existing
         documents in the collection.
   * - - Cannot output to a sharded collection. Input collection,
         however, can be sharded.
     - - Can output to a sharded collection. Input collection can
         also be sharded.
   * - - Corresponds to the SQL statements:

         - .. code-block:: sql
              :copyable: false

              INSERT INTO T2 SELECT * FROM T1

         - .. code-block:: sql
              :copyable: false

              SELECT * INTO T2 FROM T1

     - - Corresponds to the SQL statement:

         -  .. code-block:: sql
               :copyable: false

               MERGE T2 AS TARGET
               USING (SELECT * FROM T1) AS SOURCE
               ON MATCH (T2.ID = SOURCE.ID)
               WHEN MATCHED THEN
                 UPDATE SET TARGET.FIELDX = SOURCE.FIELDY
               WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
                 INSERT (FIELDX)
                 VALUES (SOURCE.FIELDY)

Behaviors
---------

$out Read Operations Run on Secondary Replica Set Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :pipeline:`$out` can run on 
replica set secondary nodes if all the nodes in
cluster have :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <view-fcv>` set 
to ``4.4`` or higher and the :doc:`/core/read-preference` is set to 
secondary.

Read operations of the :pipeline:`$out` statement occur on the 
secondary nodes, while the write operations occur only on the 
primary nodes.

Not all driver versions support targeting of :pipeline:`$out` 
operations to replica set secondary nodes. Check your 
:driver:`driver </>` documentation to see when your driver added
support for :pipeline:`$out` running on a secondary.

Create New Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$out` operation creates a new collection if one does not
already exist.

The collection is not visible until the aggregation completes. If the
aggregation fails, MongoDB does not create the collection.

Replace Existing Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the collection specified by the :pipeline:`$out` operation already
exists, then upon completion of the aggregation, the :pipeline:`$out`
stage atomically replaces the existing collection with the new results
collection. Specifically, the :pipeline:`$out` operation:

#. Creates a temp collection.
#. Copies the indexes from the existing collection to the temp collection.
#. Inserts the documents into the temp collection.
#. Calls the :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command with ``dropTarget: true``
   to rename the temp collection to the destination collection.

The :pipeline:`$out` operation does not change any indexes that existed on the
previous collection. If the aggregation fails, the :pipeline:`$out` operation
makes no changes to the pre-existing collection.

Index Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pipeline will fail to complete if the documents produced by the
pipeline would violate any unique indexes, including the index on the
``_id`` field of the original output collection.

If the :pipeline:`$out` operation modifies a collection with an
:atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>` index, you must delete and
re-create the search index. Consider using :pipeline:`$merge` instead.

Interaction with ``mongodump``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :binary:`~bin.mongodump` started with :option:`--oplog
<mongodump.--oplog>` fails if a client issues an aggregation pipeline
that includes :pipeline:`$out` during the dump process. See
:option:`mongodump --oplog <mongodump.--oplog>` for more information.

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70
   
   * - Restrictions
     - Description
     
   * - :doc:`Transactions </core/transactions>`

     - An aggregation pipeline cannot use :pipeline:`$out` inside
       :doc:`transactions </core/transactions>`.

   * - :doc:`View definition </core/views>`

     - The :pipeline:`$out` stage is not allowed as part of a
       :doc:`view definition </core/views>`. If the view definition
       includes nested pipeline (e.g. the view definition includes
       :pipeline:`$lookup` or :pipeline:`$facet` stage), this
       :pipeline:`$out` stage restriction applies to the nested
       pipelines as well.

   * - :pipeline:`$lookup` stage

     - Starting in 4.2, you cannot include the :pipeline:`$out` stage
       in the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage's :ref:`nested pipeline
       <lookup-syntax-let-pipeline>`.

   * - :pipeline:`$facet` stage

     - :pipeline:`$facet` stage's :ref:`nested pipeline
       <lookup-syntax-let-pipeline>` cannot include the
       :pipeline:`$out` stage.

   * - :pipeline:`$unionWith` stage

     - :pipeline:`$unionWith` stage's :ref:`nested pipeline
       <unionWith-pipeline>` cannot include the :pipeline:`$out` stage.

   * - :readconcern:`"linearizable"` read concern

     - .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-out-linearizable.rst

Examples
--------

In the ``test`` database, create a collection ``books`` with the
following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("test").books.insertMany([
      { "_id" : 8751, "title" : "The Banquet", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 2 },
      { "_id" : 8752, "title" : "Divine Comedy", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 1 },
      { "_id" : 8645, "title" : "Eclogues", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 2 },
      { "_id" : 7000, "title" : "The Odyssey", "author" : "Homer", "copies" : 10 },
      { "_id" : 7020, "title" : "Iliad", "author" : "Homer", "copies" : 10 }
   ])

If the ``test`` database does not already exist, the insert operation
creates the database as well as the ``books`` collection.

Output to Same Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following aggregation operation pivots the data in the ``books``
collection in the ``test`` database to have titles grouped by authors and then writes
the results to the ``authors`` collection, also in the ``test`` database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("test").books.aggregate( [
       { $group : { _id : "$author", books: { $push: "$title" } } },
       { $out : "authors" }
   ] )

First Stage (``$group``):
   The :pipeline:`$group` stage groups by the ``authors`` and uses
   :group:`$push` to add the titles to a ``books`` array field:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { "_id" : "Dante", "books" : [ "The Banquet", "Divine Comedy", "Eclogues" ] }
      { "_id" : "Homer", "books" : [ "The Odyssey", "Iliad" ] }

Second Stage (``$out``):
   The :pipeline:`$out` stage outputs the documents to the ``authors``
   collection in the ``test`` database.

To view the documents in the output collection, run the following
operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("test").authors.find()

The collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : "Homer", "books" : [ "The Odyssey", "Iliad" ] }
   { "_id" : "Dante", "books" : [ "The Banquet", "Divine Comedy", "Eclogues" ] }

Output to a Different Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   For a :ref:`replica set <replica-set>` or a standalone, if the
   output database does not exist, :pipeline:`$out` also creates
   the database.

   For a :ref:`sharded cluster <sharded-cluster>`, the specified
   output database must already exist.

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, :pipeline:`$out` can output to a collection in
a database different from where the aggregation is run.

The following aggregation operation pivots the data in the ``books``
collection to have titles grouped by authors and then writes the
results to the ``authors`` collection in the ``reporting`` database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("test").books.aggregate( [
       { $group : { _id : "$author", books: { $push: "$title" } } },
       { $out : { db: "reporting", coll: "authors" } }
   ] )

First Stage (``$group``):
   The :pipeline:`$group` stage groups by the ``authors`` and uses
   :group:`$push` to add the titles to a ``books`` array field:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { "_id" : "Dante", "books" : [ "The Banquet", "Divine Comedy", "Eclogues" ] }
      { "_id" : "Homer", "books" : [ "The Odyssey", "Iliad" ] }

Second Stage (``$out``):
   The :pipeline:`$out` stage outputs the documents to the ``authors``
   collection in the ``reporting`` database.

To view the documents in the output collection, run the following
operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("reporting").authors.find()

The collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : "Homer", "books" : [ "The Odyssey", "Iliad" ] }
   { "_id" : "Dante", "books" : [ "The Banquet", "Divine Comedy", "Eclogues" ] }
