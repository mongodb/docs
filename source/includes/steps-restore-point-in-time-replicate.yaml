title: Run the replicate database script

  If you are restoring a single node replica set, skip to the next step.

  If you do not have any excluded collections or databases, you can use the
  ``seedSecondary.sh`` script to create secondaries from backup artifacts.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    ./seedSecondary.sh <port> <oplog-size>
post: |
  Replace <port> with the port of the restored :program:`mongod` instance. Specify a size
  in gigabytes for the new oplog in the ``<oplog-size>`` argument. See
  :ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing` for more information on oplog sizing. The
  primary instance will need enough oplog to catch up from the timestamp of the
  snapshot.

pre: |
  Restart restored instance use :method:`rs.add()` to add this member
  to the replica set. See the :manual:`rs.add() reference
  entry </reference/method/rs.add/>` in the MongoDB Manual documentation.

  If you are restoring a single node replica set, restart the instance
  use :ref:`rs.initiate()`, as described in the :manual:`rs.initiate reference
  entry </reference/method/rs.initiate/>` in the MongoDB documentation
  to create the new replica set.
