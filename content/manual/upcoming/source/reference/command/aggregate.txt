Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: aggregate

   Performs aggregation operation using the :ref:`aggregation pipeline
   <aggregation-pipeline>`. The pipeline allows users 
   to process data from a collection or other source with a sequence of 
   stage-based manipulations.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`db.aggregate` and 
      :method:`db.collection.aggregate` helper methods or with the
      :method:`~db.collection.watch` helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

Command Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :dbcommand:`aggregate` command takes the following fields as
arguments:


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field

     - Type

     - Description

   * - ``aggregate``

     - string

     - The name of the collection or view that acts as the input for the
       aggregation pipeline. Use ``1`` for collection agnostic commands.


   * - ``pipeline``

     - array

     - An array of aggregation pipeline stages that process and
       transform the document stream as part of the aggregation
       pipeline.

   * - ``explain``

     - boolean

     - Optional. Specifies to return the information on the processing of the pipeline.

       stages.

       Enables :dbcommand:`aggregate` to bypass schema validation
       during the operation. This lets you insert documents that do not
       meet the validation requirements.

   * - ``readConcern``

     - document

     - Optional. Specifies the :term:`read concern`.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-readConcern-syntax.rst

   * - ``hint``

     - string or document

     - Optional. The index to use for the aggregation. The index is on the initial
       collection/view against which the aggregation is run.

       Specify the index either by the index name or by the index
       specification document.

       The ``hint`` does not apply to :pipeline:`$lookup` and
       :pipeline:`$graphLookup` stages.

   * - ``comment``

     - any

     - .. include:: /includes/extracts/comment-content.rst

       :ref:`aggregate-let-example`.

       .. versionadded:: 5.0


.. include:: /includes/deprecation-aggregate-wo-cursor.rst

For more information about the aggregation pipeline, see:

- :ref:`aggregation-pipeline`
- :doc:`/reference/aggregation`
- :doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline-limits`

Sessions
--------

For cursors created inside a session, you cannot call
:dbcommand:`getMore` outside the session.

Similarly, for cursors created outside of a session, you cannot call
:dbcommand:`getMore` inside a session.

Session Idle Timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/sessions-cursor-timeout.rst

For operations that return a cursor, if the cursor may be idle for
longer than 30 minutes, issue the operation within an explicit session
using :method:`Mongo.startSession()` and periodically refresh the
session using the :dbcommand:`refreshSessions` command. See
:limit:`Session Idle Timeout` for more information.

Transactions
------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-supported-operation.rst

However, the following stages are not allowed within transactions:

- :pipeline:`$collStats`
- :pipeline:`$currentOp`
- :pipeline:`$indexStats`
- :pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`
- :pipeline:`$listSessions`
- :pipeline:`$merge`
- :pipeline:`$out`
- :pipeline:`$planCacheStats`
- :pipeline:`$unionWith`

You also cannot specify the ``explain`` option.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-getMore.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-usage.rst

.. |operation| replace:: :dbcommand:`aggregate`

Client Disconnection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For :dbcommand:`aggregate` operation that do not include the
:pipeline:`$out` or :pipeline:`$merge` stages:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-disconnect.rst

Query Settings
--------------

.. include:: /includes/persistent-query-settings-info-for-queries.rst

.. _aggregate-command-stable-api-support:

Stable API
----------

When using :ref:`Stable API <stable-api>` V1:

- You cannot use the following stages in an :dbcommand:`aggregate`
  command:

  .. include:: /includes/aggregation/stable-api-unsupported-stages.rst

- Don't include the ``explain`` field in an :dbcommand:`aggregate`
  command. If you do, the server returns an :ref:`APIStrictError <api-strict-resp>` error.

- When using the :pipeline:`$collStats` stage, you can only use the
  ``count`` field. No other :pipeline:`$collStats` fields are
  available.

Example
-------

.. include:: /includes/deprecation-aggregate-wo-cursor.rst

Rather than run the :dbcommand:`aggregate` command directly, most
users should use the :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` helper
provided in :binary:`~bin.mongosh` or the equivalent helper in
their driver. 

Except for the first two examples which demonstrate the command 
syntax, the examples in this page use the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` helper.

.. include:: /includes/sample-data-usage.rst

Aggregate Data with Multi-Stage Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database contains documents 
like these:

.. include:: /includes/sample-data-additional-fields-note.rst

.. include:: /includes/agg-sample-documents.rst

The following example performs an :dbcommand:`aggregate` operation on
the ``movies`` collection to calculate the count of each distinct
genre that appears in the collection.

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/aggregation/pipelines/run-cmd-pipeline/run-pipeline.snippet.run-cmd-pipeline.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example

In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, this operation can use the
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` helper as in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/aggregation/pipelines/project-unwind-group/run-pipeline.snippet.project-unwind-group.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example

Use $currentOp on an Admin Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example runs a pipeline with two stages on the admin
database. The first stage runs the :pipeline:`$currentOp` operation 
and the second stage filters the results of that operation. 

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/aggregation/pipelines/currentOp/run-pipeline.snippet.current-op-agg.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example

.. note::

   The :dbcommand:`aggregate` command does not specify a collection and
   instead takes the form ``{aggregate: 1}``. This is because the initial 
   :pipeline:`$currentOp` stage does not draw input from a collection. It
   produces its own data that the rest of the pipeline uses. 

   The new :method:`db.aggregate()` helper has been added to assist in
   running collectionless aggregations such as this. The above aggregation
   could also be run like :ref:`this <admin-pipeline-currentOp>` example.

   
Return Information on the Aggregation Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following aggregation operation sets the optional field ``explain``
to ``true`` to return information about the aggregation operation.

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/aggregation/pipelines/explain-field/run-pipeline.snippet.agg-explain-field.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example

.. note:: The ``explain`` output is subject to change between releases.



Interaction with ``allowDiskUseByDefault``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-allowDiskUseByDefault.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-usedDisk.rst



Aggregate Data Specifying Batch Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify an *initial* batch size, specify the ``batchSize`` in the
``cursor`` field, as in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/aggregation/pipelines/batch-size/run-pipeline.snippet.agg-batch-size.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example
      
.. include:: /includes/batch-size-aggregate.rst

Specify a Collation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-description.rst

.. include:: /includes/collation-agg-example.rst
   
For descriptions on the collation fields, see
:ref:`collation-document-fields`.

Hint an Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/hint-index-agg-example.rst

Override Default Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/override-readconcern-agg.rst

.. _aggregate-let-example:

Use Variables in ``let`` 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |let-option| replace:: :ref:`let <aggregate-let-option>`

.. include:: /includes/let-variables-match-note.rst

The ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database contains documents 
like this one:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      title: "The Shawshank Redemption", 
      year: 1994,
      rated: "R",
      imdb: { rating: 9.3, votes: 1513145, id: 111161 },
      runtime: 142
   }

The following example uses the ``let`` option to define variables that can be used 
in the pipeline. This aggregation finds movies with high ratings and long runtimes:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/tested/command-line/mongosh/aggregation/pipelines/let-option-run-cmd/run-pipeline.snippet.let-opt-run-cmd.js
   :language: javascript
   :category: usage example
