========================
Deploy a Sharded Cluster
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MMS lets you deploy and monitor :term:`sharded clusters <sharded
cluster>`. Sharded clusters scale data horizontally across multiple
machines to let you store large data sets and perform high throughput
operations. For a full description of sharded clusters, see the
:manual:`Sharding Introduction /core/sharding-introduction` in the MongoDB
manual.

This tutorial describes how to deploy a sharded cluster that is managed by
MMS. After deploying a cluster, you can use MMS to add shards and perform
other management operations on the cluster.
