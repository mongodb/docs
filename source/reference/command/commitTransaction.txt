Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: commitTransaction

   Saves the changes made by the operations in the :doc:`multi-document
   transaction </core/transactions>` and ends the transaction. 

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`Session.commitTransaction` and
      :method:`Session.withTransaction`
      helper methods
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

   To run the :dbcommand:`commitTransaction`, the command must be run
   against the ``admin`` database and run within a
   :method:`Session`. 


Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

           
Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      commitTransaction: 1, 
      txnNumber: <long>,
      writeConcern: <document>,
      autocommit: false,
      comment: <any>
   }

Behavior
--------

Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When committing the transaction, the session uses the :doc:`write
concern </reference/write-concern>` specified at the transaction start.
See :method:`Session.startTransaction()`.

If you commit using the :writeconcern:`"w: 1" <\<number\>>` write
concern, your transaction can be :doc:`rolled back if there is a
failover. </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`.

Atomicity
~~~~~~~~~

When a transaction commits, all data changes made in the transaction
are saved and visible outside the transaction. That is, a transaction
will not commit some of its changes while rolling back others.
