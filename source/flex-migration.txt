After your tool of choice supports {+Flex-clusters+}, update your code by 
replacing all references to deprecated instance types with
references to {+Flex-Clusters+}.

.. note:: 

   If your workloads require :ref:`Private Endpoints
   <private-endpoint-overview>` or
   :ref:`Continuous Backup and Point-in-Time Restore <pit-restore>`, we
   recommend that you switch to |service| {+Dedicated-Clusters+}.

.. _flex-migration-api:

Migrating API Configuration
---------------------------

The :oas-atlas-tag:`Cluster </Clusters>` API endpoints listed in the table in this 
section are compatible with ``M2``/``M5`` {+clusters+}.
As of January 2025, these endpoints manage {+Flex-clusters+}. You can
continue using these API endpoints without change until they reach End of Life 
(EOL) in January 2026.

As of January 2025, API endpoints for :oas-atlas-tag:`Serverless Instances
<Serverless-Instances>` manage {+Flex-clusters+}. After March 2025, all existing 
{+Serverless-instances+} will be migrated to {+Free-clusters+}, {+Flex-clusters+}, 
or Dedicated clusters, according to your usage. If your {+Serverless-instance+} 
is migrated to a {+Free-cluster+} or Dedicated cluster, you must use the 
:oas-atlas-tag:`Cluster </Clusters>` API endpoint instead. To see which tiers 
|service| will migrate your instances to, consult the 
`All Clusters <https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/clusters>`__ 
page in the |service| UI.

If you attempt to create an ``M2`` or ``M5`` {+cluster+} using the
:oas-atlas-op:`<createCluster>` endpoint, or a {+Serverless-instance+}
using the :oas-atlas-op:`<createServerlessInstance>` endpoint, between
January of 2025 and January of 2026, you will instead create a
{+Flex-cluster+}. Support for these endpoints ends January 2026.

You must replace calls to
{+Serverless-instance+} API endpoints with appropriately configured
calls to the :oas-atlas-tag:`Clusters <Clusters>` API endpoints before your
{+Serverless-instances+} are migrated to {+Flex-clusters+}.

The following changes also apply to the listed API endpoints beginning
January of 2025.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Endpoint
     - Impact

   * - :oas-atlas-op:`<listServerlessPrivateEndpoints>`
     - Deprecated for new {+Flex-clusters+}. Will return an error once 
       {+Serverless-instances+} are migrated to Free, Flex or Dedicated clusters 
       after March 2025.

   * - :oas-atlas-op:`<upgradeSharedCluster>`
     - When used on {+Flex-clusters+}, ``upgradeSharedCluster`` takes the 
       value set by the user, but does not toggle Continuous Backup because 
       Continuous Backup is not available for {+Flex-clusters+}.

   * - :oas-atlas-op:`<createServerlessInstance>`
     - When used on {+Flex-clusters+}, ``createServerlessInstance`` takes the 
       value set by the user, but does not toggle Continuous Backup because 
       Continuous Backup is not available for {+Flex-clusters+}.

   * - :oas-atlas-op:`<updateServerlessInstance>`
     - When used on {+Flex-clusters+}, ``updateServerlessInstance`` takes the 
       value set by the user, but does not toggle Continuous Backup because 
       Continuous Backup is not available for {+Flex-clusters+}.

   * - :oas-atlas-op:`<setServerlessAutoIndexing>`
     - When used on {+Flex-clusters+}, ``setServerlessAutoIndexing`` takes the 
       value set by the user, but does not toggle Auto-Indexing because 
       Auto-Indexing is not available for {+Flex-clusters+}.

   * - :oas-atlas-op:`<getServerlessAutoIndexing>`
     - When used on {+Flex-clusters+}, ``getServerlessAutoIndexing`` takes the 
       value set by the user, but does not toggle Auto-Indexing because 
       Auto-Indexing is not available for {+Flex-clusters+}.

.. _flex-migration-terraform:

Terraform Atlas Provider Migration
--------------------------------------

The `HashiCorp Terraform Provider <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/flex_cluster>`__ 
supports {+Flex-clusters+}. General Terraform 
support for ``M2``/``M5`` {+clusters+} and {+Serverless-instances+} will continue
until January 2026. 

You must update your Terraform configurations to
operate on {+Flex-clusters+} according to the following timelines,
depending on which features you use:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Update Deadline

   * - `Private Endpoint Interface Link
       <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/privatelink_endpoint_service>`__
     - March, 2025

   * - `Serverless PrivateLink Endpoint Service
       <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/privatelink_endpoint_service_serverless>`__
       for new  {+Serverless-instances+}
     - January, 2025

   * - `Serverless PrivateLink Endpoint Service
       <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs/resources/privatelink_endpoint_service_serverless>`__ 
       for existing  {+Serverless-instances+}
     - March, 2025

   * - All other features
     - January, 2026

.. _flex-migration-go-sdk:

Go SDK Migration
----------------

The {+atlas-go-sdk+} will support {+Flex-clusters+} starting in November
of 2024. General SDK support for ``M2``/``M5`` {+clusters+} and
{+Serverless-instances+} will continue until January 2026. You must
update your SDK scripts to operate on {+Flex-clusters+} according to
the following timelines, depending on which features you use:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Update Deadline

   * - The :github:`ServerlessPrivateEndpointsApi <mongodb/atlas-sdk-go/blob/main/docs/docs/ServerlessPrivateEndpointsApi.md>`
     - March, 2025

   * - All other features
     - January, 2026

.. _flex-migration-cli:

{+atlas-cli+} Migration
------------------------

The {+atlas-cli+} will support {+Flex-clusters+} beginning December of
2024. General {+atlas-cli+} support for ``M2``/``M5`` {+clusters+} and
{+Serverless-instances+} will continue until January 2026. Support for
{+pit-restore+} on {+Serverless-instances+} ended in January 2025. You
must update your {+atlas-cli+} workflows to remove
{+Serverless-Instance+} {+pit-restore+} before January 2025; you must
remove all ``M2``/``M5`` and {+Serverless-Instance+} commands from
your {+atlas-cli+} workflows before January 2026.

.. _flex-migration-ak8so:

{+ak8so+} Migration
----------------------------------------

The automatic migration of ``M2`` and ``M5`` {+clusters+} and {+Serverless-instances+}
to {+Flex-clusters+} is seamless in |ak8so| without you having to make any
migration changes, even though your CRD configurations might still contain parameters
that are EOL.

The :ref:`{+ak8so+} <atlas-operator>` supports {+Flex-clusters+} beginning
February 2025. You can create and manage {+Flex-clusters+} in the same
``AtlasDeployment`` Custom Resources. You can't create new ``M2``/``M5`` {+clusters+}
and {+Serverless-instances+}.

Existing {+Serverless-instances+} are deprecated.

Replace references to ``spec.serverlessSpec`` in the ``AtlasDeployment``
Custom Resource with configuration for ``spec.flexSpec``. To learn more,
see :ak8so:`atlasdeployment-custom-resource` in the {+ak8so+} documentation.

New releases of {+ak8so+} will cease
supporting existing ``M2``/``M5`` {+clusters+} and
{+Serverless-instances+} in Summer 2025. Older versions of {+ak8so+}
will continue to support these instance types until January
2026.

Support for private endpoints on {+Serverless-instances+} will end March 2025. 
You must update your {+ak8so+} configurations to remove private endpoints that 
reach EOL. You must remove all remaining ``M2``/``M5`` and 
{+Serverless-Instance+} features from your {+ak8so+} configurations before 
January 2026.

To preserve backwards compatibility of the APIs for a period of time, |service|
will continue to allow for migrated {+clusters+} to be managed
through the same APIs (old and new APIs), including when using |ak8so|. The backwards
compatibility of APIs will remain in place until January 2026, when the old
APIs will be removed and only APIs related to {+Flex-clusters+} will remain in place.

.. _flex-migration-cfn-cdk:

{+service+} CloudFormation Migration
------------------------------------

{+service+} CFN and CDK will support {+Flex-clusters+} beginning in
the first half of 2025. General support for ``M2``/``M5`` {+clusters+}
will continue until January 2026.

Support for :github:`Serverless Private Endpoints
<mongodb/mongodbatlas-cloudformation-resources/tree/master/cfn-resources/serverless-private-endpoint>`
and the ``Properties.ContinuousBackupEnabled`` parameter of the
:github:`Serverless Instance
<mongodb/mongodbatlas-cloudformation-resources/tree/master/cfn-resources/serverless-instance/docs#mongodbatlasserverlessinstance>`
resource will end when {+service+} CFN introduces {+Flex-cluster+}
support. You must update your CFN and CDK resources to remove these
resources by March 2025. You must remove all ``M2``/``M5`` and 
{+Serverless-instance+} features from your {+service+} CFN and CDK resources 
before January 2026.
