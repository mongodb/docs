      You can filter the invoices by status and date.
      
      - To filter by status, click the :guilabel:`Status` drop-down and
        select the status to which you want to limit the results:
      
        .. list-table::
           :widths: 20 80
           :header-rows: 1
           :stub-columns: 1
      
           * - Status
             - Invoice Type
      
           * - Pending
             - Invoices still pending payment.
      
           * - Free
             - Invoices with a total charge of ``$0.00``.
      
           * - Successful
             - Invoices that are paid.
      
      - To filter by invoice date, set the :guilabel:`From` or
        :guilabel:`To` date inputs to the required date range.
      
        - If you leave :guilabel:`From` blank, |mms| sets the lower
          date boundary to the organization's creation date.
      
        - If you leave :guilabel:`To` blank, |mms| sets the upper date
          boundary to the current date.
      
   .. step:: Open your desired invoice.
      
      For the desired invoice, click the link shown in either the
      :guilabel:`Invoice Date` or :guilabel:`Invoice Period` columns.
