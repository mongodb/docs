====================================
Change Sharded Cluster to WiredTiger
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Starting in version 3.2, WiredTiger is the default storage engine
for MongoDB.

Use this tutorial to update MongoDB 3.6 sharded clusters to use
:ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`.

For earlier versions of MongoDB:

- To convert a 3.4 sharded cluster that uses MMAPv1, see the
  :v3.4:`MongoDB 3.4 manual
  </tutorial/change-sharded-cluster-wiredtiger>`.

- To convert a 3.2 sharded cluster that uses MMAPv1, see the
  :v3.2:`MongoDB 3.2 manual
  </tutorial/change-sharded-cluster-wiredtiger>`.

Considerations
--------------

Downtime
~~~~~~~~

If you change the host or port of any
:term:`shard`, you must update the shard configuration as well.

MongoDB 3.6 and PSA 3-member Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern,
available for WiredTiger, is enabled by default. However, for **MongoDB
3.6.1-3.6.x**, if you have a three-member shard replica set with a
primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture, you can disable
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern for that shard replica set.
Disabling :readconcern:`"majority"` for a three member PSA architecture
avoids possible cache-pressure build up.


The procedure below disables :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern for
MongoDB 3.6.1-3.6.x PSA architecture by including
:option:`--enableMajorityReadConcern false <mongod
--enableMajorityReadConcern>`. If you are running a MongoDB 3.6.0 PSA
architecture, first upgrade to the latest 3.6 version in order to
disable this read concern.

.. note::

   Disabling :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern disables support
   for :doc:`/changeStreams`.

For more information on PSA architecture and read concern
:readconcern:`"majority"`, see :ref:`3.6-disable-read-concern-majority`.

MongoDB 3.0 or Greater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. include:: /includes/fact-wiredtiger-minimum-version.rst

Default Bind to Localhost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/fact-default-bind-ip-change.rst

Config Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 3.4, config servers must be :ref:`deployed as
replica sets (CSRS) <3.4-remove-sccc>`. As such, version 3.4+ config
servers already use the WiredTiger storage engine.

XFS and WiredTiger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the WiredTiger storage engine, using XFS for data bearing nodes is
recommended on Linux. For more information, see
:ref:`prod-notes-linux-file-system`.

Procedure
---------

.. note::

   A sharded cluster **can** have mixed storage engines for its
   individual :term:`shards <shard>`.
   
   If you are running a MongoDB 3.6.0 three-member PSA architecture and
   wish to disable :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern, upgrade
   first to the latest 3.6 version.

To change the storage engine for a replica set :term:`shard <shard>` to
WiredTiger:

A. Update the secondary members to WiredTiger.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update the secondary members one at a time:

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/steps/change-replica-set-wiredtiger.rst

Repeat the steps for the remaining secondary members, updating them one
at a time.

B. Step down the primary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once all the secondary members have been upgraded to WiredTiger,
connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary and use
:method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and force an election
of a new primary.

.. container:: admonition

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.stepDown()

C. Update the old primary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the primary has stepped down and become a secondary, update the
secondary to use WiredTiger as before:

.. container:: admonition

   .. include:: /includes/steps/change-replica-set-wiredtiger.rst

.. |seemore| replace:: See :ref:`sharded-cluster-mmapv1-wt-3.6-psa`.
