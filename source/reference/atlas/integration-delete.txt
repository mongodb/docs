The ``integrations delete`` command deletes the specified third-party 
service integration for the |service| project. The command prompts you 
to confirm the operation when you run the command without the ``--force`` option. You can also delete a third-party service integration through 
the |service| :atlas:`API 
</reference/api/third-party-integration-settings-delete/>`. 

.. important:: 

   Deleting an integration from a project removes that integration 
   configuration only for that project. This does not affect any other 
   project or organizationâ€™s configured integrations.
