.. time:: 10

What You'll Need
----------------

.. include:: /includes/prereqs_read_CRUD.rst

- Complete the :doc:`/crud/insert` guide so that there
  is data in your database to delete.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Connect to your MongoDB instance.

      .. tip::

         In this code block, there is a comment to replace the connection URI
         with your own. Replace the URI string with your own
         :ref:`Atlas connection string <guides-get-connection-string>`.

      .. include:: /includes/drivers_delete_connect.rst

   .. step:: Get the database and collection.

      Switch to the database and collection you wish to query. In
      this case we will be using the ``{+guides-db+}`` database and
      ``comets`` collection. 

      .. include:: /includes/bind_db_comets.rst

   .. step:: Delete the documents.

      MongoDB stores documents as ``BSON``, a binary form of JavaScript 
      Object Notation ``JSON``. The database stores documents in 
      collections.

      .. include:: /includes/delete_documents.rst

   .. step:: Display your results.

      .. include:: /includes/delete_display.rst

   .. step:: Check your results.

      Here is the complete code followed by sample output.

      .. include:: /includes/crud_delete_query.rst
