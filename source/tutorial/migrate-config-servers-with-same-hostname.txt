=============================================
Migrate Config Servers with the Same Hostname
=============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This procedure migrates a :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>`
in a :doc:`sharded cluster </core/sharding>`
to a new system that uses *the same* hostname.

#. Shut down the config server that you are moving.

   This will render all config data for your cluster :ref:`read only
   <sharding-config-server>`.

#. Change the DNS entry that points to the system that provided the old
   config server, so that the *same* hostname points to the new
   system.

   How you do this depends on how you organize your DNS and
   hostname resolution services.

#. Move the entire :setting:`dbpath` file system tree from the old
   config server to the new config server. This command, issued on the
   old config server system, may resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      rsync -az /data/configdb mongo-config0.example.net:/data/configdb

#. Start the config instance on the new system. The default invocation
   is:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --configsvr

When you start the third config server, your cluster will become
writable and it will be able to create new splits and migrate chunks
as needed.
