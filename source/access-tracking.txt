Overview
--------
|service| parses the MongoDB database logs to collect a list of
authentication requests made against your clusters through the
following methods:

- {+mongosh+}
- :compass:`Compass </>`
- :driver:`Drivers </>`

Authentication requests made with API Keys through the 
{+atlas-admin-api+} are not logged.

|service| logs the following information for each authentication
request within the last 7 days:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - Timestamp
     - The date and time of the authentication request.

   * - Username
     - The username associated with the database user who made the
       authentication request.

       For LDAP usernames, the UI displays the
       resolved LDAP name. Hover over the name to see the full LDAP
       username.

   * - IP Address
     - The IP address of the machine that sent the authentication
       request.

   * - Host
     - The target server that processed the authentication request.

   * - Authentication Source
     - The database that the authentication request was made against.
       ``admin`` is the authentication source for SCRAM-SHA users and
       ``$external`` for LDAP users.

   * - Authentication Result
     - The success or failure of the authentication request. A reason
       code is displayed for the failed authentication requests.

Authentication requests are pre-sorted by descending timestamp with 25 entries per page.

Logging Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/log-rate-limiting.rst

If authentication requests occur during a period when logs are not
collected, they will not appear in the database access history.
