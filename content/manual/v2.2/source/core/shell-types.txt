MongoDB :term:`BSON` provide support for additional data types than
:term:`JSON`. :doc:`Drivers </applications/drivers>` provide native
support for these data types in host languages and the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell also provides several helper classes to support
the use of these data types in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` JavaScript
shell. See :doc:`/reference/mongodb-extended-json` for additional
information.

.. _mongo-shell-data-type:

Date
----

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides various options to return the date,
either as a string or as an object:

- ``Date()`` method which returns the current date as a string.

- ``Date()`` constructor which returns an ``ISODate`` object when used
  with the ``new`` operator.

- ``ISODate()`` constructor which returns an ``ISODate`` object when
  used with *or* without the ``new`` operator.

Consider the following examples:

- To return the date as a string, use the ``Date()`` method, as in the
  following example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     var myDateString = Date();

  - To print the value of the variable, type the variable name in the
    shell, as in the following:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       myDateString

    The result is the value of ``myDateString``:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       Wed Dec 19 2012 01:03:25 GMT-0500 (EST)

  - To verify the type, use the ``typeof`` operator, as in the
    following:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       typeof myDateString

    The operation returns ``string``.

- To get the date as an ``ISODate`` object, instantiate a new instance
  using the ``Date()`` constructor with the ``new`` operator, as in the
  following example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     var myDateObject = new Date();

  - To print the value of the variable, type the variable name in the
    shell, as in the following:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       myDateObject

    The result is the value of ``myDateObject``:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       ISODate("2012-12-19T06:01:17.171Z")

  - To verify the type, use the ``typeof`` operator, as in the
    following:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       typeof myDateObject

    The operation returns ``object``.

- To get the date as an ``ISODate`` object, instantiate a new instance
  using the ``ISODate()`` constructor *without* the ``new`` operator,
  as in the following example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     var myDateObject2 = ISODate();

  You can use the ``new`` operator with the ``ISODate()`` constructor
  as well.

  - To print the value of the variable, type the variable name in the
    shell, as in the following:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       myDateObject2

    The result is the value of ``myDateObject2``:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       ISODate("2012-12-19T06:15:33.035Z")

  - To verify the type, use the ``typeof`` operator, as in the
    following:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       typeof myDateObject2

    The operation returns ``object``.

ObjectId
--------

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the ``ObjectId()`` wrapper class
around :term:`ObjectId` data types. To generate a new ObjectId, use
the following operation in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   new ObjectId

.. see:: :doc:`/core/object-id` for full documentation of ObjectIds in
   MongoDB.

.. _shell-type-long:

NumberLong
----------

By default, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell treats all numbers as
floating-point values. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the
``NumberLong()`` class to handle 64-bit integers.

The ``NumberLong()`` constructor accepts the long as a string:

.. code-block:: javascript

   NumberLong("2090845886852")

The following examples use the ``NumberLong()`` class to write to the
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.insert( { _id: 10, calc: NumberLong("2090845886852") } )
   db.collection.update( { _id: 10 },
                         { $set:  { calc: NumberLong("2555555000000") } } )
   db.collection.update( { _id: 10 },
                         { $inc: { calc: NumberLong(5) } } )

Retrieve the document to verify:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.findOne( { _id: 10 } )

In the returned document, the ``calc`` field contains a
``NumberLong`` object:

.. code-block:: sh

   { "_id" : 10, "calc" : NumberLong("2555555000005") }

If you use the :update:`$inc` to increment the value of a field that
contains a ``NumberLong`` object by a **float**, the data type changes
to a floating point value, as in the following example:

#. Use :update:`$inc` to increment the ``calc`` field by ``5``, which the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell treats as a float:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.update( { _id: 10 },
                            { $inc: { calc: 5 } } )

#. Retrieve the updated document:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.findOne( { _id: 10 } )

   In the updated document, the ``calc`` field contains a floating
   point value:

   .. code-block:: sh

      { "_id" : 10, "calc" : 2555555000010 }

.. _shell-type-int:

NumberInt
----------

By default, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell treats all numbers as
floating-point values. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the
``NumberInt()`` constructor to explicitly specify 32-bit integers.
