Overview
--------

Enabling access control on a MongoDB deployment enforces
authentication, requiring users to identify themselves. When accessing
a MongoDB deployment that has access control enabled, users can only
perform actions as determined by their roles.

The following tutorial enables access control on a standalone
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and uses the :ref:`default
authentication mechanism <authentication-mechanism-default>`. For all
supported authentication mechanisms, see
:ref:`available-authentication-mechanisms`.

User Administrator
------------------

With access control enabled, ensure you have a user with
:authrole:`userAdmin` or :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role in the
``admin`` database. This user can administrate user and roles such as:
create users, grant or revoke roles from users, and create or modify
customs roles.

.. _enable-auth-procedure:

Procedure
---------

The following procedure first adds a user administrator to a MongoDB
instance running without access control and then enables access control.

.. note::

   The example MongoDB instance uses :option:`port 27017 <mongod
   --port>` and the data directory ``/var/lib/mongodb`` directory . The
   example assumes the existence of the data directory
   ``/var/lib/mongodb``. Specify a different data directory as
   appropriate.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Replica Sets and Sharded clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replica sets and sharded clusters require internal authentication
between members when access control is enabled. For more details,
please see :doc:`/core/security-internal-authentication`.

Localhost Exception
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create users either before or after enabling access control. If
you enable access control before creating any user, MongoDB provides a
:ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>` which allows you to
create a user administrator in the ``admin`` database. Once created,
you must authenticate as the user administrator to create additional
users as needed.
