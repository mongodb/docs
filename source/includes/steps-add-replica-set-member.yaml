content: |

   Use the following procedure to add the host if it doesn't appear
   in the :guilabel:`Hostname` list:

   a. In :guilabel:`Hostname`, select :guilabel:`New Server`.

      If no hosts have yet been added to the project, the
      :guilabel:`Hostname` list does not appear. Click
      :guilabel:`Install Agent` instead.

   b. In the :guilabel:`Add New Server` dialog, select your operating
      system and click :guilabel:`Next`.

   c. Follow the
      :doc:`instructions to install </tutorial/nav/install-mongodb-agent>`
      a {+mdbagent+} on the new host.

   .. note::

     When adding a new member to a replica set, set ``Build Indexes``
     to ``True`` if you want the member's ``mongod`` to build indexes.
     You cannot change this value after the {+aagent+} adds the
     new member to the replica set. To learn more, see
     :rsconf:`members[n].buildIndexes <rsconf.members[n].buildIndexes>`.

   .. warning::

     If your replica set uses |tls|, you must create and install the
     necessary |tls| certificates on the new replica set member host first.
     Then, set the |tls| settings for the |mongod| or |mongos| process
     for the new replica set member on that host. Automation does not
     create and install the certificates and configure these settings
     automatically. If you do not configure |tls| on the new member,
     you cannot add it to the existing |tls|-enabled replica set. To
     learn how to enable |tls| on the new replica set member, see
     :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment`.

   d. In the :guilabel:`Replica Set Configuration` section, complete
      the following fields for the new member:

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 30 70

         * - :guilabel:`Auth Schema Version`
           - Select the schema for storing the user data for your
             deployment. See :manual:`Upgrade to SCRAM </release-notes/3.0-scram/>`
             for more information.

         * - :guilabel:`Feature Compatibility` (Optional)
           - Select the :manual:`feature compatibility set </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`.
             This field appears if your deployment MongoDB version is
             ``3.4`` or later.

         * - :guilabel:`Version`
           - Select the MongoDB version for your replica set.

             .. include:: /includes/admonitions/available-mongodb-versions.rst

         * - :guilabel:`Data Directory`
           - Specify the full path of the directory where the ``mongod``
             process will store data files.

             :gold:`IMPORTANT:` Make sure the new member's data directory does not 
             contain data. The new member will copy the data from an existing member.

             If the new member is in a :manual:`recovering </reference/glossary/#std-term-recovering>` 
             state, it must exit and become a :manual:`secondary </reference/glossary/#std-term-secondary>` 
             before MongoDB can copy all data as part of the replication process. This process takes time 
             but does not require administrator intervention.

         * - :guilabel:`Log File`
           - Specify the location and name of the log file for the ``mongod``
             process on the new host.
