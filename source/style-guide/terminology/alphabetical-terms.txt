       letters for generic references (the filter dialog box).

       .. note::
          A dialog box is usually modal, which means that you can't
          minimize it and must respond to it before proceeding. In
          contrast, you can keep a window open but minimized while
          working on another task.

     -
     - In UI environments, *drag* refers to using the mouse to "pull"
       an item from one area of the screen to another area. Because the
       action of dropping (releasing the mouse button) is intrinsic to
       the action of dragging items in a UI, don't use *drag and drop*
       as a verb.

   * - trillion
     -
     - *Trillion* indicates different numbers in different numeration
       systems. In the short-scale system (used in the English-speaking
       countries), it indicates 1012, or 1,000,000,000,000. In the
       long-scale system (used in Spanish-speaking countries), it
       indicates 1018, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.

       To avoid confusion when you're citing a large number such as a

       prevent writing numerals, use *trillion* as defined in the
       short-scale system.
