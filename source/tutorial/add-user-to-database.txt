========================
Add a User to a Database
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionchanged:: 2.5.3

.. Overview
.. --------

.. todo This will be further updated per DOCS-2312

Prerequisites
-------------

.. todo This wording below is mostly placeholder. Will revisit when work on DOCS-2312

.. include:: /includes/access-create-user.rst

A user with either the :authrole:`userAdmin` or :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`
role has both those :ref:`actions <security-user-actions>`.

If you have not first created a user with one of those roles, do
so as described in :doc:`/tutorial/add-user-administrator`.

When adding a user to multiple databases, you must define the user
*for each database*. See :ref:`password-hashing-security` for
important security information.

To add a user and set the user's credentials and roles, use the
:method:`db.createUser()` method.

Procedure
---------

.. todo These are just examples for now. Procedures coming ...

Create User with Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, the following operation creates ``accountUser`` in the ``products`` database
and gives the user the ``readWrite`` and ``dbAdmin`` roles.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use products
   db.createUser(
      {
        user: "accountUser",
        pwd: "password",
        roles: [ "readWrite", "dbAdmin" ]
      }
   )

Create User Without Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation creates a user named ``reportsUser`` in the ``admin``
database but does not yet assign roles:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.createUser(
      {
        user: "reportsUser",
        pwd: "password",
        roles: [ ]
      }
   )


Create Administrative User with Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation creates a user named ``appAdmin`` in the
``admin`` database and gives the user ``readWrite`` access to the
``config`` database, which lets the user change certain settings for
sharded clusters, such as to the balancer setting.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   db.createUser(
      {
        user: "appAdmin",
        pwd: "password",
        roles:
          [
            "clusterAdmin",
            { db: "config", role: "readWrite" }
          ]
      }
   )
