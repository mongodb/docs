title: Create your first MongoDB deployment.
stepnum: 4
ref: deployment-type
pre: |
  MMS provides several options for where to deploy MongoDB. The choice you
  make for your first deployment does not limit your choices for future
  deployments. For your first deployment, select from the following options:
action:
  - heading: Local
    pre: |
      Installs MongoDB directly to your local machine. This is useful for
      learning about MongoDB and testing applications.
  - heading: AWS
    pre: |
      Installs MongoDB on an existing Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.
      You can use existing EC2 servers on the account or provision new
      ones through this setup process by providing your EC2 API keys when
      prompted. Running MongoDB on AWS is useful for both development and
      production and allows you to quickly and easily add servers as
      needed.
  - heading: Other Remote
    pre: |
      Installs MongoDB to an existing deployment of systems.
---
title: Connect to your MongoDB deployment.
stepnum: 5
ref: connect-to-mongodb
pre: |
  To connect to the MongoDB deployment, retrieve the hostname and port
  information from the MMS console and then use a MongoDB client, such
  as the :program:`mongo` shell or :manual:`driver
  </applications/drivers>` to connect to MongoDB.
action:
  - heading: Retrieve the hostname and port of your MongoDB deployment.
    pre: |
      In MMS, select the :guilabel:`Deployment` tab, then the
      :guilabel:`Deployment` page, and then the :guilabel:`view mode`.
      Click the hostname of the MongoDB deployment. For a :term:`replica
      set`, click the deployment listed as ``PRIMARY``. For a
      :term:`cluster <sharded cluster>`, click the deployment listed as
      ``MONGOS``. The name of your deployment is listed at the top of
      the page and uses the following form:
    language: sh
    code: |
      <server-prefix>.mongodbdns.com:<port>
  - heading: Connect through the :program:`mongo` shell.
    pre: |
      At the system shell, run the :program:`mongo` executable and
      specify the host and port of the deployment. Issue a command
      in the following form:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongo --username <user> --password <pass> --host <host> --port <port>
  - heading: Connect with a driver.
    pre: |
      Use your :manual:`driver </applications/drivers>` to create a
      :manual:`/reference/connection-string` that specifies the
      hostname and port of the deployment. The connection string for
      your driver will resemble the following:
    language: "none"
    code: | 
      mongodb://[<username>:<password>@]hostname0<:port>[,hostname1:<port1>][,hostname2:<port2>][...][,hostnameN:<portN>]
    post: |
      If you specify a seed list of all hosts in a replica set in
      the connection string, your driver will automatically connect
      to the :term:`primary`.
      For standalone deployments, you will only specify a single
      host. For sharded clusters, only specify a single
      :program:`mongos` instance.
