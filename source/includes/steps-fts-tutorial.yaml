               }
             }
           }

  The above index definition specifies the :ref:`standard analyzer
  <ref-standard-analyzer>` as the default analyzer for all three
  indexed fields. It also specifies the :ref:`keyword analyzer
  <ref-keyword-analyzer>` as an alternate analyzer for the ``title``
  field, with the name ``keywordAnalyzer``. The keyword analyzer
  indexes the entire field as a single term, so it only returns
  results if the search term and the specified field match exactly. 
  The index definition also specifies :ref:`standard analyzer
  <ref-standard-analyzer>` as the analyzer by default for queries 
  on the ``genres`` field, which is an array of strings. For indexing 
  arrays, |fts| only requires the data type of the array elements. You 
  don't have to specify that the data is contained in an array in 
  the index definition. 

  For more information about static and dynamic field mappings, see
  :ref:`index definitions <ref-index-definitions>`. For more
  information about ``multi`` analyzer designations, see
  :ref:`ref-path`.

  By contrast, the same query using the ``standard`` analyzer would
  find all the movies with the word ``Count`` or ``Monte`` or
  ``Cristo`` in the title.
