Monitoring Agent Installation
-----------------------------

Consider the following issues if you encounter difficulty installing
the Monitoring agent.

- Make sure that the system running the agent has ``pymongo``
  installed. If your system runs a 2.4.x series Python, verify the
  installation of other :ref:`requirements <mms-requirements>`.

- Ensure that the system running the agent can resolve and connect to the
  MongoDB instances. To confirm, log into the system where the agent
  is running and issue a command in the following form:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongo [hostname]:[port]

  Replace ``[hostname]`` with the hostname and ``[port]`` with the
  port that the database is listening on.

- Verify that the Monitoring agent can connect on TCP port 443
  (outbound) to the MMS server (i.e. "``mms.mongodb.com``".)

- Allow the agent to run for 5-10 minutes to allow host discovery
  and initial data collection.

- If your MongoDB instances run with authentication enabled, ensure
  that MMS has these credentials. You can supply these credentials when
  adding a host by specifying credentials in the "Add Host Interface," for
  every host that has authentication enabled. You
  may also click on the "Edit" host button (i.e. the pencil) on the
  Hosts page in the MMS console to provide credentials.

- If you continue to encounter problems, check the agent's output or
  logs for errors.
