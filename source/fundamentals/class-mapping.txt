Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to customize the way the {+driver-long+}
maps BSON documents to and from {+language+} classes. You should read this page
to learn more about the default class mapping behavior, or if you need to
customize the way the driver serializes or deserializes your data.

Automatic Class Mapping
-----------------------

When you use a class, rather than a ``BsonDocument``, to represent data in a 
MongoDB collection, the {+driver-short+} automatically creates a **class map**
that it uses to serialize or deserialize your data. It does this mapping by matching 
the name of the field in the document to the name of the property in the class.

.. important::

   The type of the property in your class should match the type of the field in
   the document. The {+driver-short+} instantiates a serializer based on the
   type of the property in your class. If the types don't match when the driver
   attempts to deserialize the data, the serializer throws an exception.

Manually Creating A Class Map
-----------------------------

You can bypass the driver's automatic class mapping functionality, and manually
define the class map by using the ``RegisterClassMap()`` method.

The following example defines a ``Person`` class:

.. code-block:: csharp

   public class Person
   {
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public int Age { get; set; }
       public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}
   }

The following code demonstrates how to register the class map for the ``Person``
class: 

.. code-block:: csharp
   
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classMap => 
   {
       classMap.MapMember(p => p.Name);
       classMap.MapMember(p => p.Age);
       classMap.MapMember(p => p.Hobbies);
   });

.. important::

   You must register a class map *before* it's needed in your code. We recommend
   registering class maps prior to initializing a connection with MongoDB.

You can also manually map a subset of class properties, while still
allowing the driver to automatically map the remaining properties. To do this, 
register a class map and call the ``AutoMap()`` method before manually 
specifying your properties.

In the following code example, the ``AutoMap()`` method maps all properties
of the ``Person`` class, then manually adjusts the mapping for the ``Hobbies``
field:

.. code-block:: csharp
   
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classMap => 
   {
       classMap.AutoMap();
       classMap.MapMember(p => p.Hobbies).SetElementName("favorite_hobbies");
   });

Customize Class Serialization
-----------------------------

You can customize how the driver serializes and deserializes documents at the class
level by using attributes with the class or by calling methods while registering
a class map.

Ignore Extra Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a BSON document is deserialized to a {+language+} class, the {+driver-short+}
looks at the name of each field in the document and tries to find a matching property
name in the class. By default, if a field in the document doesn't have a match in the class,
the driver throws an exception. 

You can choose to ignore any elements that do 
not have a matching class property by using the ``BsonIgnoreExtraElements`` attribute.
This prevents the driver from throwing an exception, and maps any other fields
that have matching class properties.

The following example shows how to add a ``BsonIgnoreExtraElements`` attribute
to a class.

.. code-block:: csharp

   [BsonIgnoreExtraElements]
   public class Person
   {
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public int Age { get; set; }
       public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}
   }

You can also ignore any extra elements when registering a class map:

.. code-block:: csharp
   
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classMap => 
   {
        classMap.AutoMap();
        classMap.SetIgnoreExtraElements(true);
   });

Mapping with Constructors
-------------------------

By default, the {+driver-short+} can automatically map a class only if the class has
a constructor with no arguments. If you want the driver to use a constructor that accepts
one or more arguments, you can add the ``BsonConstructor`` attribute to the constructor.
In this case, the driver the driver examines the types to determine how to map the
constructor arguments to class properties or fields.

When the driver creates a class map for the following ``Person`` class, it will use the 
constructor marked with the ``BsonConstructor`` attribute. The ``name`` argument will
map to the ``Name`` property and the ``age`` argument will map to the ``Age`` property.

.. code-block:: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 7

   public class Person 
   {
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public int Age { get; set; }
       public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}

       [BsonConstructor]
       public Person(string name, string age)
       {
           Name = name;
           Age = age;
       }
   }

.. tip:: Multiple ``BsonConstructor`` attributes

   If there is more than one constructor with the ``BsonConstructor``
   attribute, the driver uses the constructor that has the most
   parameters with matching fields in the document.

You can also specify the constructor to use when registering your class map:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 17

   public class Person 
   {
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public int Age { get; set; }
       public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}

       public Person(string name, string age)
       {
           Name = name;
           Age = age;
       }
   }

   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classMap =>
   {
       classMap.AutoMap();
       classMap.MapCreator(p => new Person(p.Name, p.Age));
   });

Customize Property Serialization
--------------------------------

You can customize how the driver serializes a class property by
adding attributes to the property. For more information about custom
property serialization, see :ref:`csharp-custom-serialization`.

Support Extra Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can design your {+language+} class to store any extra elements in your
document that don't have matching class properties. To do this your class must
have a ``BsonDocument`` type property to hold the extra elements.

The following code uses the ``BsonExtraElements`` attribute with the
``ExtraElements`` property to direct the driver to store extra elements:

.. code-block:: csharp

   public class Person
   {
       public string Name { get; set; 
       public int Age { get; set; }
       public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}
       [BsonExtraElements]
       public BsonDocument ExtraElements {get; set;}
   }

You can also support extra elements when initializing a class map as follows:

.. code-block:: csharp
   
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Person>(classMap => 
   {
       classMap.AutoMap();
       classMap.MapExtraElementsMember(p => p.ExtraElements);
   });

.. note::

   After the driver serializes a class with extra elements back to BSON, the 
   extra elements may not be in the same order as they were in the original 
   document.

Dynamically Serialize Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use a method to determine whether or not to serialize a property. For
the driver to automatically use the method when serializing, you must prefix the
method name with ``ShouldSerialize`` followed by the name of the property that
the method applies to. When the driver sees a method with this naming
convention, it uses that method to determine whether or not to serialize
properties that have the provided property name.

The following example creates a method that only serializes the ``Age`` property
if its value is not equal to ``0``. The driver does not serialize any properties
whose values don't meet this requirement:

.. code-block:: csharp

   public class Person 
   {
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public int Age { get; set; }
       public List<string> Hobbies {get; set;}

       public bool ShouldSerializeAge()
       {
          return Age != 0;
       }
   }

You can also specify the method while registering a class map:

.. code-block:: csharp

   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Employee>(classMap => 
   {
       classMap.AutoMap();
       classMap.MapMember(p => c.Age).SetShouldSerializeMethod(
           obj => ((Person) obj).Age != 0
       );
   });
