the following guidelines:

.. list-table::

   * - Don't include "MongoDB" in a title unless the page is a product 
       landing page.

       Use the full MongoDB product name on the first mention in the 
       body text. Subsequent mentions may use the product name without 
       MongoDB.

       service.
     - Users leverage Atlas to create a:

       - *database*, not a *Database*.
       - *cluster*, not a *Cluster*.

   * - Don't abbreviate MongoDB names, unless the Legal and Marketing
       departments have approved.

     - Never abbreviate S3 Snapshot Store as SSS.

     - Don't write *MongoDB's available*, but *MongoDB is available*.

   * - Use full, three-digit version numbers when referring to a
       specific release or feature. Use the two-digit release series
       when referring to a common feature.
