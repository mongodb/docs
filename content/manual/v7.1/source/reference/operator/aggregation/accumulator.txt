.. group:: $accumulator

   .. versionadded:: 4.4

   Defines a custom :ref:`accumulator operator
   <agg-operators-group-accumulators>`. Accumulators are operators that
   maintain their state (e.g. totals, maximums, minimums, and related
   data) as documents progress through the pipeline. Use the
   :group:`$accumulator` operator to execute your own JavaScript
   functions to implement behavior not supported by the MongoDB Query
   Language. See also :expression:`$function`.

   :group:`$accumulator` is available in these stages:

   - :pipeline:`$bucket`
  
   - :pipeline:`$bucketAuto`
  
   - :pipeline:`$group`

   .. important::

      Executing JavaScript inside of an aggregation operator may
      decrease performance. Only use the :group:`$accumulator` operator
      if the provided :ref:`pipeline operators
      <aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>` cannot fulfill your
      application's needs.

Syntax
------

The :group:`$accumulator` operator has this syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { 
     $accumulator: {
       init: <code>,
       initArgs: <array expression>,        // Optional
       accumulate: <code>,
       accumulateArgs: <array expression>,
       merge: <code>,
       finalize: <code>,                    // Optional
       lang: <string>
     }
   }

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 15 40

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - :ref:`init <accumulator-init>`

     - String or Code

     - .. _accumulator-init:
       
       Function used to initialize the state. The ``init`` function
       receives its arguments from the :ref:`initArgs
       <accumulator-initArgs>` array expression. You can specify the
       function definition as either BSON type Code or String.

       The ``init`` function has the following form:

       .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          function (<initArg1>, <initArg2>, ...) {
            ...
            return <initialState>
          }

       .. note::
       
          Spilling to disk or running a query on a sharded cluster can
          cause the accumulator to be computed as a merge of multiple
          sub-accumulations, each of which begins by calling ``init()``.
          Ensure that your ``init()``, ``accumulate()``, and ``merge()``
          functions are compatible with this execution model.

   * - :ref:`initArgs <accumulator-initArgs>`

     - Array

     - .. _accumulator-initArgs:
     
       Optional. Arguments passed to the ``init`` function.

       ``initArgs`` has the following form:

       .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          [ <initArg1>, <initArg2>, ... ]

       .. important::

          When used in a :pipeline:`$bucketAuto` stage, ``initArgs``
          cannot refer to the group key (i.e., you cannot use the
          ``$<fieldName>`` syntax). Instead, in a
          :pipeline:`$bucketAuto` stage, you can only specify
          constant values in ``initArgs``.

   * - :ref:`accumulate <accumulator-accumulate>`

     - String or Code

     - .. _accumulator-accumulate:
     
       Function used to accumulate documents. The ``accumulate``
       function receives its arguments from the current state and
       :ref:`accumulateArgs <accumulator-accumulateArgs>` array
       expression. The result of the ``accumulate`` function becomes
       the new state. You can specify the function definition as
       either BSON type Code or String.

       The ``accumulate`` function has the following form:

       .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          function(state, <accumArg1>, <accumArg2>, ...) {
            ... 
            return <newState>
          }

   * - :ref:`accumulateArgs <accumulator-accumulateArgs>`

     - Array

     - .. _accumulator-accumulateArgs:
     
       Arguments passed to the ``accumulate`` function. You can use
       ``accumulateArgs`` to specify what field value(s) to pass to
       the ``accumulate`` function.

       ``accumulateArgs`` has the following form:

       .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          [ <accumArg1>, <accumArg2>, ... ]

   * - :ref:`merge <accumulator-merge>`

     - String or Code

     - .. _accumulator-merge:
     
       Function used to merge two internal states. ``merge`` must be
       either a String or Code BSON type. ``merge`` returns the
       combined result of the two merged states. For information on
       when the merge function is called, see
       :ref:`merge-multiple-states`.

       The ``merge`` function has the following form:

       .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          function (<state1>, <state2>) {
            <logic to merge state1 and state2>
            return <newState>
          }

   * - :ref:`finalize <accumulator-finalize>`

     - String or Code

     - .. _accumulator-finalize:
     
       Optional. Function used to update the result of the accumulation.

       The ``finalize`` function has the following form:

       .. code-block:: javascript
          :copyable: false

          function (state) {
            ...
            return <finalState>
          }

   * - :ref:`lang <accumulator-lang>`

     - String

     - .. _accumulator-lang:

       The language used in the :group:`$accumulator` code.

       .. important::

          Currently, the only supported value for ``lang`` is ``js``.

Behavior
--------

The following steps outline how the :group:`$accumulator` operator
processes documents:

1. The operator begins at an initial state, defined by the
   :ref:`init <accumulator-init>` function. 
   
#. For each document, the operator updates
   the state based on the :ref:`accumulate <accumulator-accumulate>`
   function. The :ref:`accumulate <accumulator-accumulate>` function's
   first argument is the current state, and additional arguments are be
   specified in the :ref:`accumulateArgs <accumulator-accumulateArgs>`
   array.

#. When the operator needs to merge multiple intermediate states, it
   executes the :ref:`merge <accumulator-merge>` function. For more
   information on when the :ref:`merge <accumulator-merge>` function is
   called, see :ref:`merge-multiple-states`.
   
#. If a :ref:`finalize <accumulator-finalize>` function has been
   defined, once all documents have been processed and the state has
   been updated accordingly, :ref:`finalize <accumulator-finalize>`
   converts the state to a final output.

.. _merge-multiple-states:

Merge Two States with ``$merge``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of its internal operations, the :group:`$accumulator` operator
may need to merge two separate, intermediate states. The :ref:`merge
<accumulator-merge>` function specifies how the operator should merge
two states.

For example, :group:`$accumulator` may need to combine two states when:

- :group:`$accumulator` is run on a sharded cluster. The operator
  needs to merge the results from each shard to obtain the final
  result.

- A single :group:`$accumulator` operation exceeds its specified
  memory limit. If you specify the :method:`allowDiskUse
  <db.collection.aggregate()>` option, the operator stores the
  in-progress operation on disk and finishes the operation in memory.
  Once the operation finishes, the results from disk and memory are
  merged together using the :ref:`merge <accumulator-merge>` function.

  .. seealso::

     :ref:`group-memory-limit`

.. note::

   The :ref:`merge <accumulator-merge>` function always merges two
   states at a time. In the event that more than two states must be
   merged, the resulting merge of two states is merged with a single
   state. This process repeats until all states are merged.

Javascript Enabled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use :group:`$accumulator`, you must have server-side scripting
enabled.

If you do not use :group:`$accumulator` (or :expression:`$function`,
:query:`$where`, or :dbcommand:`mapReduce`), disable server-side
scripting: 

- For a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, see
  :setting:`security.javascriptEnabled` configuration option or
  :option:`--noscripting <mongod --noscripting>` command-line option.

- For a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance, see
  :setting:`security.javascriptEnabled` configuration option or the
  :option:`--noscripting <mongos --noscripting>` command-line option
  starting in MongoDB 4.4.
  
  | In earlier versions, MongoDB does not allow JavaScript execution on
    :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

Examples

Use ``$accumulator`` to Implement the ``$avg`` Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   This example walks through using the :group:`$accumulator` operator
   to implement the :group:`$avg` operator, which is already supported
   by MongoDB. The goal of this example is not to implement new
   functionality, but to illustrate the behavior and syntax of the
   :group:`$accumulator` operator with familiar logic.

In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, create a sample collection named
``books`` with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.books.insertMany([
     { "_id" : 8751, "title" : "The Banquet", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 2 },
     { "_id" : 8752, "title" : "Divine Comedy", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 1 },
     { "_id" : 8645, "title" : "Eclogues", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 2 },
     { "_id" : 7000, "title" : "The Odyssey", "author" : "Homer", "copies" : 10 },
     { "_id" : 7020, "title" : "Iliad", "author" : "Homer", "copies" : 10 }
   ])

The following operation :pipeline:`groups <$group>` the documents by
``author``, and uses :group:`$accumulator` to compute the average
number of copies across books for each author:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.books.aggregate([
   { 
     $group : 
     { 
       _id : "$author", 
       avgCopies: 
       { 
         $accumulator: 
         {
           init: function() {                        // Set the initial state
             return { count: 0, sum: 0 } 
           },

           accumulate: function(state, numCopies) {  // Define how to update the state
             return {
               count: state.count + 1,
               sum: state.sum + numCopies
             } 
           },

           accumulateArgs: ["$copies"],              // Argument required by the accumulate function

           merge: function(state1, state2) {         // When the operator performs a merge, 
             return {                                // add the fields from the two states
               count: state1.count + state2.count,
               sum: state1.sum + state2.sum
             } 
           },

           finalize: function(state) {               // After collecting the results from all documents,
             return (state.sum / state.count)        // calculate the average
           },
           lang: "js"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ])

Result
``````

This operation returns the following result:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : "Dante", "avgCopies" : 1.6666666666666667 }
   { "_id" : "Homer", "avgCopies" : 10 }

Behavior
````````

The :group:`$accumulator` defines an initial state where ``count``
and ``sum`` are both set to ``0``. For each document that the 
:group:`$accumulator` processes, it updates the state by:

- Incrementing the ``count`` by 1 and

- Adding the values of the document's ``copies`` field to the ``sum``.
  The :ref:`accumulate <accumulator-accumulate>` function can access the
  ``copies`` field because it is passed in the
  :ref:`accumulateArgs <accumulator-accumulateArgs>` field.

With each document that is processed, the
:ref:`accumulate <accumulator-accumulate>` function returns the updated
state.

Once all documents have been processed, the
:ref:`finalize <accumulator-finalize>` function divides the ``sum`` of
the copies by the ``count`` of documents to obtain the average. This
removes the need to keep a running computed average, since the
:ref:`finalize <accumulator-finalize>` function receives the cumulative
``sum`` and ``count`` of all documents.

Comparison with ``$avg``
````````````````````````

This operation is equivalent to the following pipeline, which uses the
:group:`$avg` operator:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.books.aggregate([
   { 
     $group : { 
       _id : "$author", 
       avgCopies: { $avg: "$copies" }
     }
   }
   ])

Use ``initArgs`` to Vary the Initial State by Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :ref:`initArgs <accumulator-initArgs>` option in
to vary the initial state of :group:`$accumulator`. This can be
useful if you want to, for example:

- Use the value of a field which is not in your state to affect your
  state, or 
  
- Set the initial state to a different value based on the group being
  processed.

In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, create a sample collection named
``restaurants`` with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.insertMany([
     { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Food Fury", "city" : "Bettles", "cuisine" : "American" },
     { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Meal Macro", "city" : "Bettles", "cuisine" : "Chinese" },
     { "_id" : 3, "name" : "Big Crisp", "city" : "Bettles", "cuisine" : "Latin" },
     { "_id" : 4, "name" : "The Wrap", "city" : "Onida", "cuisine" : "American" },
     { "_id" : 5, "name" : "Spice Attack", "city" : "Onida", "cuisine" : "Latin" },
     { "_id" : 6, "name" : "Soup City", "city" : "Onida", "cuisine" : "Chinese" },
     { "_id" : 7, "name" : "Crave", "city" : "Pyote", "cuisine" : "American" },
     { "_id" : 8, "name" : "The Gala", "city" : "Pyote", "cuisine" : "Chinese" }
   ])

Suppose an application allows users to query this data to find
restaurants. It may be useful to show more results for
the city where the user lives. For this example, we assume that the
user's city is called in a variable called ``userProfileCity``.

The following aggregation pipeline :pipeline:`groups <$group>` the
documents by ``city``. The operation uses the :group:`$accumulator`
to display a different number of results from each city depending on
whether the restaurant's city matches the city in the user's profile:

.. note::

   To execute this example in :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, replace
   ``<userProfileCity>`` in the :ref:`initArgs <accumulator-initArgs>`
   with a string containing an actual city value, such as ``Bettles``.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 12

   db.restaurants.aggregate([
   { 
     $group : 
     { 
       _id : { city: "$city" }, 
       restaurants: 
       { 
         $accumulator: 
         {
           init: function(city, userProfileCity) {        // Set the initial state
             return {
               max: city === userProfileCity ? 3 : 1,     // If the group matches the user's city, return 3 restaurants
               restaurants: []                            // else, return 1 restaurant
             } 
           },
           
           initArgs: ["$city", <userProfileCity>],        // Argument to pass to the init function

           accumulate: function(state, restaurantName) {  // Define how to update the state
             if (state.restaurants.length < state.max) {
               state.restaurants.push(restaurantName);
             }
             return state;
           },

           accumulateArgs: ["$name"],                     // Argument required by the accumulate function

           merge: function(state1, state2) {              
             return {
               max: state1.max,
               restaurants: state1.restaurants.concat(state2.restaurants).slice(0, state1.max)
             } 
           },

           finalize: function(state) {                   // Adjust the state to only return field we need
             return state.restaurants
           }

           lang: "js"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ])

Results
```````

If the value of ``userProfileCity`` is ``Bettles``, this operation
returns the following result:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : { "city" : "Bettles" }, "restaurants" : { "restaurants" : [ "Food Fury", "Meal Macro", "Big Crisp" ] } }
   { "_id" : { "city" : "Onida" }, "restaurants" : { "restaurants" : [ "The Wrap" ] } }
   { "_id" : { "city" : "Pyote" }, "restaurants" : { "restaurants" : [ "Crave" ] } }

If the value of ``userProfileCity`` is ``Onida``, this operation
returns the following result:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : { "city" : "Bettles" }, "restaurants" : { "restaurants" : [ "Food Fury" ] } }
   { "_id" : { "city" : "Onida" }, "restaurants" : { "restaurants" : [ "The Wrap", "Spice Attack", "Soup City" ] } }
   { "_id" : { "city" : "Pyote" }, "restaurants" : { "restaurants" : [ "Crave" ] } }

If the value of ``userProfileCity`` is ``Pyote``, this operation
returns the following result:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : { "city" : "Bettles" }, "restaurants" : { "restaurants" : [ "Food Fury" ] } }
   { "_id" : { "city" : "Onida" }, "restaurants" : { "restaurants" : [ "The Wrap" ] } }
   { "_id" : { "city" : "Pyote" }, "restaurants" : { "restaurants" : [ "Crave", "The Gala" ] } }

If the value of ``userProfileCity`` is any other value, this operation
returns the following result:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : { "city" : "Bettles" }, "restaurants" : { "restaurants" : [ "Food Fury" ] } }
   { "_id" : { "city" : "Onida" }, "restaurants" : { "restaurants" : [ "The Wrap" ] } }
   { "_id" : { "city" : "Pyote" }, "restaurants" : { "restaurants" : [ "Crave" ] } }

Behavior
````````

The :ref:`init <accumulator-init>` function defines an initial state
containing ``max`` and ``restaurants`` fields. The ``max`` field sets
the maximum number of restaurants for that particular group. If the
document's ``city`` field matches ``userProfileCity``, that group
contains a maximum of 3 restaurants. Otherwise, if the document ``_id``
does not match ``userProfileCity``, the group contains at most a single
restaurant. The :ref:`init <accumulator-init>` function receives both
the ``city`` ``userProfileCity`` arguments from the :ref:`initArgs
<accumulator-initArgs>` array.

For each document that the :group:`$accumulator` processes, it pushes
the ``name`` of the restaurant to the ``restaurants`` array, provided
that name would not put the length of ``restaurants`` over the ``max``
value. With each document that is processed, the :ref:`accumulate
<accumulator-accumulate>` function returns the updated state.

The :ref:`merge <accumulator-merge>` function defines how to merge two
states. The function concatenates the ``restaurant`` arrays from each
state together, and the length of the resulting array is limited using
the `slice()
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice>`__
method to ensure that it does not exceed the ``max`` value.

Once all documents have been processed, the :ref:`finalize
<accumulator-finalize>` function modifies the resulting state to only
return the names of the restaurants.  Without this function, the ``max``
field would also be included in the output, which does not fulfill any
needs for the application.
