When you disable automation for a deployment, you can no
longer control it directly through |mms|. If you are removing a managed
process and want to be able to easily stop and start the
process after removal, you can :doc:`create scripts for stopping and
starting the process </tutorial/stop-using-automation>`.

If you do **not** want to leave a managed process running after removal,
:doc:`shut down the process </tutorial/shut-down-deployment>` before
removing it.

.. note::

   You must shut down ``mongos`` processes before you can remove them from
   Automation. The :guilabel:`Remove from Cluster` option is not available
   for ``mongos`` processes that are running.

You can continue to monitor the process after unmanaging it. If you do
continue monitoring the process, you do not need to change any backups running
for that process.

As an alternative to removing a process from automated management, you can
temporarily :doc:`suspend </tutorial/suspend-automation>` management of the process.
This is useful if you need to temporarily shut down the process, for example
for maintenance, and do not want |mms| to automatically start the
process back up until you are ready.
