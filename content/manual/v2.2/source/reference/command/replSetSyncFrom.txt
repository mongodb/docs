.. dbcommand:: replSetSyncFrom

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   :option host: Specifies the name and port number of the replica set member
                 that this member replicates from. Use
                 the ``[hostname]:[port]`` form.

   :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` allows you to explicitly configure
   which host the current :binary:`~bin.mongod` will poll :term:`oplog`
   entries from. This operation may be useful for testing different
   patterns and in situations where a set member is not replicating from
   the host you want. The member to replicate from must be a valid
   source for data in the set.

   A member cannot replicate from:

   - itself.
   - an arbiter, because arbiters do not hold data.
   - a member that does not build indexes.
   - an unreachable member.
   - a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that is not a member of the same
     replica set.

   If you attempt to replicate from a member that is more than 10 seconds
   behind the current member, :binary:`~bin.mongod` will return and log a
   warning, but it still *will* replicate from the member that is behind.

   If you run :method:`rs.syncFrom()` during initial sync, MongoDB
   produces no error messages, but the sync target will not change
   until after the initial sync operation.

   The command has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetSyncFrom: "[hostname]:[port]" }

   To run the command in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, use the following
   invocation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { replSetSyncFrom: "[hostname]:[port]" } )

   You may also use the :method:`rs.syncFrom()` helper in the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, in an operation with the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.syncFrom("[hostname]:[port]")
