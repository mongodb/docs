For |mms| to monitor, deploy, or back up a MongoDB deployment that uses
|tls-ssl|, you must enable |tls-ssl| for the |mms| project.

   Monitoring and Backup Agents with |tls-ssl|
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Starting with |onprem| 1.8, |mms| automatically configures the
   Monitoring and Backup Agents to connect to the managed deployment
   over |tls-ssl| when you activate |tls-ssl| for the |mms| project.
   You do not need to manually configure the agents' |tls-ssl| settings.

   If you are not using automation for a deployment, you can still
   configure the monitoring and backup agents manually. To learn how to 
   configure these agents, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-ssl` and
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-ssl`.

MongoDB 2.6 Supports |tls-ssl| in Enterprise Only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable |tls-ssl| for a deployment in MongoDB 2.6 and earlier, you
must use the MongoDB Enterprise Edition or create a custom build with
|tls-ssl| enabled. To configure the available MongoDB versions for your
|mms| project, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-available-mongodb-version`.

   You must complete:

   1. :ref:`Set Existing Deployments to Use TLS/SSL <set-existing-ssl>`, 
      then 
   2. :ref:`Enable SSL for the Project <set-project-ssl>` 

   before you click :guilabel:`Review & Deploy`.

Set Existing Deployments to Use |tls-ssl|

.. only:: onprem

   .. admonition:: Changed in |onprem| 2.0.3
      :class: note

      Prior to |onprem| version 2.0.3, if you enabled |tls-ssl| on a 
      project, all |mms|-managed MongoDB deployments in that project 
      had to use |tls-ssl|. With the 
      :guilabel:`Client Certificate Mode` setting introduced in 2.0.3, 
      you can set |tls-ssl| certificates as optional *or* required for 
      deployments in your project.

If you wish to enable |tls-ssl| for existing MongoDB deployments in 
your |mms| project:

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-ssl-for-existing-deployment.rst

.. _set-project-ssl:

Enable |tls-ssl| for the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before using |tls-ssl| in a deployment, you must enable |tls-ssl| for
the project. You can set |tls-ssl| as optional *or* required
for every deployment in the project.
