.. note::

   This tutorial uses the Semantic Kernel :github:`C# library
   </microsoft/semantic-kernel/tree/main/dotnet/src/Connectors/Connectors.Memory.MongoDB>`.
   For a tutorial that uses the Python library see :ref:`semantic-kernel`.

Background
----------

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/semantic-kernel/sk-background.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial, you must have the following:

- .. include:: /includes/avs-examples/shared/avs-requirements-cluster.rst

- .. include:: /includes/avs-examples/shared/avs-requirements-openai-api-key.rst

- A terminal and code editor to run your .NET application.

- `C#/.NET <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download>`__ installed.

Set Up the Environment
----------------------

You must first set up the environment for this tutorial. To set up your environment, complete the following steps.

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/semantic-kernel/sk-set-up-environment-csharp.rst

Store Custom Data in |service|
------------------------------

In this section, you initialize the `kernel
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/agents/kernel/>`__,
which is the main interface used to manage your
application's services and plugins. Through the kernel, you configure your
AI services, instantiate |service| as a vector database (also called a memory
store), and load custom data into your |service| {+cluster+}.

Copy and paste the following code into your application's ``Program.cs`` file.

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/semantic-kernel/sk-memory-store-description.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/ai-integrations/semantic-kernel/sk-create-memory-store.cs
      :language: csharp
      :copyable:

Save the file, then run the following command to load your data into |service|:

.. code-block::

   dotnet run

.. tip::

    After running the sample code, you can
    view your vector embeddings :ref:`in the {+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui-view-collections>`
    by navigating to the ``semantic_kernel_db.test`` collection in your {+cluster+}.


Create the {+avs+} Index
------------------------------------

To enable vector search queries on your vector store,
create an {+avs+} index on the ``semantic_kernel_db.test`` collection.

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an {+avs+} index, you must have :authrole:`Project Data Access
Admin` or higher access to the |service| project.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. |search-type| replace:: :guilabel:`Vector Search`
.. |index-name| replace:: ``vector_index``
.. |database-name| replace:: ``semantic_kernel_db`` database
.. |collection-name| replace:: ``test`` collection
.. |avs-namespace| replace:: ``semantic_kernel_db.test``
.. |embedding-field-name| replace:: ``embedding``

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/semantic-kernel/sk-create-index.rst

Run Vector Search Queries
-------------------------

Once |service| builds your index, you can run vector search
queries on your data.

.. _answer-questions:

Answer Questions on Your Data
-----------------------------

This section shows an example |rag| implementation
with {+avs+} and Semantic Kernel. Now that you've used {+avs+}
to retrieve semantically similar documents, paste the following code example
at the end of your ``Program.cs`` to prompt the |llm|
to answer questions based on those documents.
