Overview
--------

You can update an existing App by changing its underlying
configuration and then deploying those changes. There are multiple
ways you can do this:

- The App Services Admin UI: a web application built into MongoDB
  Atlas. It includes a graphical interface for anything you want to
  configure in your App.

- The {+cli+}: a command line tool that you can use to configure and
  deploy your App locally. You work directly with your App's underlying
  :ref:`configuration files <app-configuration>`.

- The Admin API: a REST API that you can use to configure and deploy
  your App programmatically. Admin API requests read and write your
  App's underlying configuration files.

- Automatic GitHub Deployment: a GitHub integration that syncs your App
  configuration with a GitHub repository. You can use GitHub to manage
  your App's configuration files and deploy your App by pushing changes
  to the repository.

Update an Existing App
----------------------

Before You Begin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      You will need the following to update an App in the Atlas UI:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      You will need the following to update an App in the CLI:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-admin-api-key.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/appservices-cli.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      You will need the following to update an App with the Admin API:

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-account.rst

      - .. include:: /includes/prereqs/atlas-admin-api-key.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: github

      To update an App based on configuration files in a GitHub
      repository, you must enable :ref:`Automatic GitHub Deployment
      <deploy-github>` for the App.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Make Changes to Your Application

            Start by making any additions, modifications, or deletions that you
            want to include in the deployment through the App Services UI.
            If you have drafts enabled, your changes will be saved automatically as a draft.

            .. seealso::

               Guide to :ref:`Disable Deployment Drafts <disable-deployment-drafts>`.

            .. note::

               You can only create draft changes through the App Services UI or Admin
               API. Any changes that you make with GitHub or the {+cli+} are
               deployed independently of draft changes. To avoid possible conflicts or
               inconsistencies, its best to make your changes in one place at a time.


         .. step:: Review Draft Changes

            You can review all of the draft changes to your application prior to
            deploying them.

            Click :guilabel:`Deployment` in the left navigation menu to navigate to
            your app's deployment history table. The top row of the table
            represents all of the draft changes that you've made since the
            previous deployment.

            Click the :guilabel:`Review Draft and Deploy` button in the top row to
            see a diff of the underlying :ref:`app configuration files
            <app-configuration>` that represents the draft changes that you've made.

            .. note::

               You may want to download a draft of your changes because of merge conflicts
               or to save the draft outside of the UI. You can do so in the
               :guilabel:`Review Draft and Deploy` modal by clicking :guilabel:`Export State`
               in the top right corner. You can use the download to deploy your changes in the
               {+cli-bin+} or as a reference as you reapply changes in the UI.

         .. step:: Deploy a New App Version

            After you've reviewed your draft changes and confirmed that you want
            to deploy them, click :guilabel:`Deploy`. App Services deploys a
            new version of your application that includes the draft changes.
            Client applications will automatically use the newest version, so make
            sure that you also update your client code to use the new version if
            necessary.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

            .. include:: /includes/cli-login.rst

         .. step:: Pull the Latest Version of Your App

            .. include:: /includes/cli-pull-latest.rst

         .. step:: Update Your Application

            Add, delete, and modify :ref:`configuration files <app-configuration>` for
            your application's various components.

         .. step:: Deploy the Updated App

            Deploy your changes by pushing the updated configuration
            files to your remote app.

            .. code-block:: bash

               {+cli-bin+} push --remote="<Your App ID>"

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Create a New Draft (Optional)

            A draft represents a group of application changes that you
            can deploy or discard as a single unit. If you don't create
            a draft, updates automatically deploy individually.

            To create a draft, send a ``POST`` request with no body to
            the :admin-api-endpoint:`Create a new deployment draft
            <tag/deploy/operation/adminCreateDeploymentDraft>` endpoint:

            .. code-block:: shell

               curl -X POST 'https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/drafts' \
                 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
                 -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'

            .. important:: One Draft Per User

               Each user can only create a single draft at a time, either through
               the UI or the Admin API. If you already have an existing draft, you
               can discard the changes associated with it by sending a ``DELETE``
               request to the :admin-api-endpoint:`Discard a deployment draft
               <tag/deploy/operation/adminDiscardDraft>` endpoint:

               .. code-block:: shell

                  curl -X DELETE 'https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/drafts/{draftId}' \
                    -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'

         .. step:: Make Changes to Your Application

            You can configure your app and add, modify, or delete
            components by calling the Admin API endpoints for each
            operation. For examples and detailed reference information,
            see :ref:`Atlas App Services Admin API <admin-api>`.

            If you did not create a draft, every successful Admin API
            request immediately deploys the associated updates to the
            App.

            If you created a draft, every successful Admin API request
            adds the associated updates to the draft. Send requests for
            all of the changes that you want to include in the draft.

         .. step:: Deploy the Draft

            If you created a draft, you can deploy all changes in
            the draft by sending a ``POST`` request with no body to the
            :admin-api-endpoint:`Deploy a deployment draft
            <tag/deploy/operation/adminDeployDraft>` endpoint:

            .. code-block:: shell

               curl -X POST \
                 'https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/drafts/{draftId}/deployment' \
                 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
                 --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \

   .. tab::
      :tabid: github

      With Automatic GitHub Deployment enabled, your App always uses
      configuration files from the most recent commit in your linked
      repository. For details on how to organize and define
      configuration files, see :ref:`app-configuration`.

      Update your application by adding, modifying, and deleting
      configuration files locally.

      When you are ready to deploy your changes, commit the
      configuration files and then push them to GitHub:

      .. code-block:: sh

        git add -A
        git commit -m "<commit message>"
        git push origin <branch name>

      After you push, the GitHub integration automatically deploys an
      updated version of your App based on the configuration files in
      the latest commit.

.. _deployment-draft:

Deployment Drafts
-----------------

A deployment draft is a set of one or more updates to your App that you
can apply or discard as a single group. Deploying a draft is useful when
your changes include services or functions that interact with each
other.

The App Services UI uses deployment drafts by default. While enabled,
any changes you make to your App's configuration in the App Services UI
are added to a draft that you :ref:`manually deploy <deploy-ui>`. You
can :ref:`disable UI drafts <disable-deployment-drafts>` if you prefer
to deploy immediately when you save in the UI.

The {+cli+} and :ref:`GitHub Deployment <deploy-github>` both
automatically create and deploy drafts for you. When you run the CLI
:ref:`push <appservices-push>` command or ``git push`` to your deployment
branch, the CLI or GitHub app creates a diff of your local configuration
files against the currently deployed configuration. Then it creates and
deploys a draft based on the diff.

The App Services Admin API allows you to manually create and deploy
drafts. To learn how, see :admin-api-endpoint:`Deploy a Group of Changes
<tag/deploy/Draft-and-Deploy-a-Group-of-Changes>`.

Draft Conflicts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid having multiple users make conflicting changes in UI or API drafts
at the same time. If there are multiple concurrent drafts that contain
conflicting changes, you will not be able to deploy one or more of the
drafts.

For example, if you deploy changes through the API but have an existing
UI draft with conflicting changes, your UI draft will become invalid and
you will not be able to deploy it.

To recover from a conflict, you can download configuration files for a
UI draft from the :guilabel:`Deployment` page. You can use these as a
reference to reapply changes in the UI or deploy the changes directly
with the CLI or Admin API.

.. _disable-deployment-drafts:

Disable UI Deployment Drafts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can disable UI drafts if you prefer to deploy immediately when you
save in the UI. This setting does not prevent you from manually creating
drafts with the Admin API.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      To disable UI drafts directly from the UI:

      1. Click :guilabel:`Deployment` in the left navigation menu

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Configuration` tab

      #. Under the :guilabel:`Disable Drafts in Atlas App Services`
         heading, click :guilabel:`Disable Drafts` and then confirm your
         decision in the modal window.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      To disable UI drafts with the Admin API, send a request to the
      :admin-api-endpoint:`Configure Deployment
      <tag/deploy/operation/adminConfigureDeployment>` endpoint with
      ``ui_drafts_disabled`` set to ``true``.

      .. code-block:: bash
         :emphasize-lines: 5

         curl -X PATCH https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/deploy/config \
           -H 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
           -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
           -d '{
             "ui_drafts_disabled": true,
             "automatic_deployment": { "enabled": false, "installationIds": [], "lastModified": 0 }
           }'
