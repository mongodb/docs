"With journaling enabled, MongoDB creates a journal subdirectory within the "
"directory defined by :setting:`~storage.dbPath`, which is :file:`/data/db` "
"by default. The journal directory holds journal files, which contain write-"
"ahead redo logs. The directory also holds a last-sequence-number file. A "
"clean shutdown removes all the files in the journal directory. A dirty "
"shutdown (crash) leaves files in the journal directory; these are used to "
"automatically recover the database to a consistent state when the mongod "
"process is restarted."

"longer needed for recovery purposes. Unless you write *many* bytes of data "
"per second, the journal directory should contain only two or three journal "
