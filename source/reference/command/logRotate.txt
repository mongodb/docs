.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: logRotate

   The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is an administrative command that 
   allows you to rotate
   the MongoDB logs to prevent a single logfile from consuming too
   much disk space.
   You must issue the
   :dbcommand:`logRotate`
   command against the :term:`admin database` in the form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { logRotate: 1 }

   .. note::

      Your :program:`mongod` instance needs to be running with the
      :option:`--logpath [file] <mongod --logpath>` option.

   You may also rotate the logs by sending a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the
   :program:`mongod` process.
   If your :program:`mongod` has a process ID of 2200, here's how to 
   send the signal on Linux:

   .. code-block:: sh

       kill -SIGUSR1 2200

   :dbcommand:`logRotate` renames the existing log file by
   appending the current timestamp to the filename.  The appended
   timestamp has the following form: 

   .. code-block:: none

      <YYYY>-<mm>-<DD>T<HH>-<MM>-<SS> 

   Then :dbcommand:`logRotate` creates a new log file with the same
   name as originally specified by the :setting:`logpath` setting to
   :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos`.

   .. note::

      .. versionadded:: 2.0.3   
         The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is available to 
         :program:`mongod` instances running on Windows systems with 
         MongoDB release 2.0.3 and higher.

.. :error:`16175` is thrown if logRotate fails
