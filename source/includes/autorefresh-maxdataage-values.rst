       When you initially load or manually refresh the chart, |charts|
       renders the chart with data from the cache if the data is less
       than one hour old. If the data from the cache is more than one
       hour old, |charts-short| queries the data source for the latest 
       data, refreshes the cache, and renders the chart using this data.

       When you initially load or manually refresh the chart, |charts|
       renders the chart with data from the cache if the data younger
       than the ``maxDataAge`` value, in seconds. If the data from the 
       cache is older than the ``maxDataAge`` value, in seconds, 
       |charts-short| queries the data source for the latest data, 
       refreshes the cache, and renders the chart using this data.

       When you initially load, manually refresh, or automatically
       refresh the chart, |charts| renders the chart with data from the
       cache if the data is less than one hour old. If the data from the
       cache is more than one hour old, |charts-short| queries the data
       source for the latest data, refreshes the cache, and renders the
       chart using this data.

     - The chart automatically refreshes at the ``maxDataAge`` interval
       you specify, in seconds.

       When you initially load, manually refresh, or automatically
       refresh the chart, |charts| renders the chart with data from the
       cache if the data younger than the ``maxDataAge`` value, in
       seconds. If the data from the cache is older than the
       ``maxDataAge`` value, in seconds, |charts-short| queries the data
       source for the latest data, refreshes the cache, and renders the
       chart using this data.

   * - ``true``
     - Number less than ``10``
     - The chart automatically refreshes at the minimum period of 10
       seconds. 

       When you initially load, manually refresh, or automatically
       refresh the chart, |charts| renders the chart with data from the
       cache if the data younger than the minimum ``maxDataAge`` value
       of 10 seconds. If the data from the cache is older than 10
       seconds, |charts-short| queries the data source for the latest
       data, refreshes the cache, and renders the chart using this data.
