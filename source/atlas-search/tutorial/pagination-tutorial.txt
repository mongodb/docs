|fts| queries might return many results. To make navigating results 
easier, you can either use pagination to divide results into discrete
pages or use cursor iteration to view all the results for your query.  

The following tutorials take you through the steps for paginating your
query results:

- The :ref:`pagination-skip-limit-tutorial` tutorial describes how to
  use the :pipeline:`$search` ``searchAfter`` and ``searchBefore``
  options to build functions like "Next Page", "Previous Page",
  "Load More", and infinite scroll in your application. It also
  demonstrates how to use :pipeline:`$search` ``searchAfter`` and
  ``searchBefore`` with the :pipeline:`$skip` and :pipeline:`$limit`
  stages to jump across pages. 
   
- The :ref:`iterate-cursor-tutorial` tutorial demonstrates how to 
  create an index and iterate the cursor until it is exhausted to return
  all results for a query.
