The choice of cloud provider and region affects network latency for clients
accessing your {+database-deployment+} and the
:doc:`cost of running the {+database-deployment+} </billing>`. For {+clusters+},
this choice also affects the configuration options for the available {+cluster+} 
tiers. The region refers to the physical location of your MongoDB 
{+database-deployment+}.

|service| supports deploying {+Atlas-Flex+} on a subset of each cloud provider's 
regions.

For a list of supported regions, see:

- :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
- :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`
- :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`

In the :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` page:

- Regions marked as |star| are :guilabel:`Recommended` regions that 
  provide higher availability compared to other regions. 
- Regions marked as :icon-fa4:`money` under :guilabel:`Shared` tier  
  are not available for shared tier clusters and therefore appear 
  grayed-out. These regions are available for dedicated clusters only. 

For more information, see:

- :ref:`AWS Recommended Regions <amazon-aws-availability-zones>`
- :ref:`GCP Recommended Regions <google-gcp-availability-zones>`
- :ref:`Azure Recommended Regions <microsoft-azure-availability-zones>`

   availability, see :ref:`create-cluster-multi-region`.

Cloud Providers and Regions for Dedicated Search Nodes 
------------------------------------------------------

|service| supports deploying separate :ref:`Search Nodes 
<configure-search-nodes>` for ``M10`` and higher
{+clusters+} on |aws|, |gcp|, or |azure|. |service| supports deploying 
Search Nodes in any |gcp| or |azure| regions but only a subset of 
|aws| regions.

For more information, see:

- :ref:`AWS Dedicated Search Nodes <amazon-aws-search-nodes>`
- :ref:`GCP Dedicated Search Nodes <google-gcp-search-nodes>`
- :ref:`Azure Dedicated Search Nodes <microsoft-azure-search-nodes>`
