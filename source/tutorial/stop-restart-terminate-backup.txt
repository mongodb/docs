When you stop backups for a replica set or sharded cluster |mms| stops
taking new snapshots but retains existing snapshots until their listed
expiration date.

If you later restart backups for replica set or cluster, |mms| might
perform an :cloudmgr:`inital sync </reference/glossary/#term-initial-sync>`, depending on how much time has elapsed.

If you **terminate** a backup, |mms| immediately **deletes all the
backup's snapshots.**

.. warning:: Terminating a backup triggers a full backup

   If you terminate a backup, |mms| immediately deletes the backup's
   snapshots. The next backup job runs as a full backup rather than an
   incremental backup.
