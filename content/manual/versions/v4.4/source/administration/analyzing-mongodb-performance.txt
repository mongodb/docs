As you develop and operate applications with MongoDB, you may need to
analyze the performance of the application and its database.
When you encounter degraded performance, it is often a function of database
access strategies, hardware availability, and the number of open database
connections.

Some users may experience performance limitations as a result of inadequate
or inappropriate indexing strategies, or as a consequence of poor schema
design patterns. :ref:`analyzing-performance-locks` discusses how these can
impact MongoDB's internal locking.

Performance issues may indicate that the database is operating at
capacity and that it is time to add additional capacity to the
database. In particular, the application's working set should fit in
the available physical memory.

In some cases performance issues may be temporary and related to
abnormal traffic load. As discussed in :ref:`number-of-connections`, scaling
can help relax excessive traffic.

:ref:`database-profiling` can help you to understand what operations are causing
degradation.

.. _analyzing-performance-locks:

Locking Performance
-------------------

MongoDB uses a locking system to ensure data set consistency. If
certain operations are long-running or a queue forms, performance
will degrade as requests and operations wait for the lock.

Lock-related slowdowns can be intermittent. To see if the lock has been
affecting your performance, refer to the :ref:`server-status-locks`
section and the :ref:`globalLock` section of the
:dbcommand:`serverStatus` output.

Dividing :serverstatus:`locks.<type>.timeAcquiringMicros` by
:serverstatus:`locks.<type>.acquireWaitCount`
can give an approximate average wait time for a particular lock mode.

:serverstatus:`locks.<type>.deadlockCount` provide
the number of times the lock acquisitions encountered deadlocks.

If :serverstatus:`globalLock.currentQueue.total` is consistently high,
then there is a chance that a large number of requests are waiting for
a lock. This indicates a possible concurrency issue that may be affecting
performance.

If :serverstatus:`globalLock.totalTime` is
high relative to :serverstatus:`uptime`, the database has
existed in a lock state for a significant amount of time.

Long queries can result from ineffective use of indexes;
non-optimal schema design; poor query structure; system architecture issues; or
insufficient RAM resulting in disk reads.

.. _number-of-connections:

Number of Connections
---------------------

In some cases, the number of connections between the applications and the
database can overwhelm the ability of the server to handle requests. The
following fields in the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` document can provide insight:

- :serverstatus:`connections` is a container for the following
  two fields:

  - :serverstatus:`connections.current` the total number of
    current clients connected to the database instance.

  - :serverstatus:`connections.available` the total number of
    unused connections available for new clients.

If there are numerous concurrent application requests, the database may have
trouble keeping up with demand. If this is the case, then you will need to
increase the capacity of your deployment.

For write-heavy applications, deploy :term:`sharding` and add one or more
:term:`shards <shard>` to a :term:`sharded cluster` to distribute load among
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

Spikes in the number of connections can also be the result of
application or driver errors. All of the officially supported MongoDB
drivers implement connection pooling, which allows clients to use and
reuse connections more efficiently. An extremely high number of
connections, particularly without corresponding workload, is often
indicative of a driver or other configuration error.

Unless constrained by system-wide limits, the maximum number of
incoming connections supported by MongoDB is configured with the
:setting:`~net.maxIncomingConnections` setting. On Unix-based systems,
system-wide limits can be modified using the ``ulimit`` command, or by
editing your system's ``/etc/sysctl`` file. See :doc:`/reference/ulimit`
for more information.

.. _database-profiling:

Database Profiling
------------------

The :doc:`/tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler` collects detailed
information about operations run against a mongod instance. The
profiler's output can help to identify inefficient queries and
operations.

You can enable and configure profiling for individual databases or for
all databases on a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.
Profiler settings affect only a single :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and
will not propagate across a :term:`replica set` or :term:`sharded
cluster`.

See :doc:`/tutorial/manage-the-database-profiler` for information on
enabling and configuring the profiler.

The following profiling levels are available:

.. include:: /includes/database-profiler-levels.rst

.. include:: /includes/warning-profiler-performance.rst

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-log-slow-queries.rst
   
.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-log-query-shapes-plan-cache-key.rst

.. _ftdc-stub:

Full Time Diagnostic Data Capture
---------------------------------

To help MongoDB engineers analyze server behavior, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` processes include a Full Time Diagnostic Data
Capture (FTDC) mechanism. FTDC is enabled by default. Due to its
importance in debugging deployments, FTDC thread failures are fatal and
stop the parent ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` process.

.. important:: FTDC Privacy

   FTDC data files are compressed and not human-readable. MongoDB Inc.
   engineers cannot access FTDC data without explicit permission
   and assistance from system owners or operators.

   FTDC data **never** contains any of the following information:

   - Samples of queries, query predicates, or query results
   - Data sampled from any end-user collection or index
   - System or MongoDB user credentials or security certificates

   FTDC data contains certain host machine information such as
   hostnames, operating system information, and the options or settings
   used to start the :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` or 
   :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`. This information may be
   considered protected or confidential by some organizations or
   regulatory bodies, but is not typically considered to be Personally
   Identifiable Information (PII). For clusters where these fields were
   configured with protected, confidential, or PII data, please notify
   MongoDB Inc. engineers before sending the FTDC data so appropriate
   measures can be taken.

FTDC periodically collects statistics produced by the following 
commands:

- :dbcommand:`serverStatus`
- :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` (:binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` only)
- :dbcommand:`collStats` for the :data:`local.oplog.rs` collection (:binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` only)
- :dbcommand:`connPoolStats` (:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` only)

Depending on the host operating system, the diagnostic data may include
one or more of the following utilization statistics:

- CPU utilization
- Memory utilization
- Disk utilization related to performance. FTDC does not include
  data related to storage capacity.
- Network performance statistics. FTDC only captures metadata and
  does not capture or inspect any network packets.

.. note::

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, if the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process runs
   in a :term:`container`, FTDC will report utilization statistics from
   the perspective of the container instead of the host operating
   system. For example, if a the :binary:`~bin.mongod` runs in a
   container that is configured with RAM restrictions, FTDC will
   calculate memory utilization against the container's RAM limit, as
   opposed to the host operating system's total available RAM.

FTDC collects statistics produced by the following commands on
file rotation or startup:

- :dbcommand:`getCmdLineOpts`
- :dbcommand:`buildInfo`
- :dbcommand:`hostInfo`

:binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` processes store FTDC data files in a 
``diagnostic.data`` directory under the instances 
:setting:`storage.dbPath`. All diagnostic data files are stored
under this directory. For example, given a :setting:`~storage.dbPath`
of ``/data/db``, the diagnostic data directory would be
``/data/db/diagnostic.data``. 

:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` processes store FTDC data files in a 
diagnostic directory relative to the :setting:`systemLog.path` log 
path setting. MongoDB truncates the logpath's file extension and 
concatenates ``diagnostic.data`` to the remaining name. For example, 
given a :setting:`~systemLog.path` setting of
``/var/log/mongodb/mongos.log``, the diagnostic data directory would be 
``/var/log/mongodb/mongos.diagnostic.data``.

FTDC runs with the following defaults:

- Data capture every 1 second
- 200MB maximum ``diagnostic.data`` folder size. 

These defaults are designed to provide useful data to MongoDB Inc. 
engineers with minimal impact on performance or storage size. These 
values only require modifications if requested by MongoDB Inc. engineers 
for specific diagnostic purposes.

You can view the FTDC source code on the
`MongoDB Github Repository <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/master/src/mongo/db/ftdc>`_.
The ``ftdc_system_stats_*.ccp`` files specifically define any
system-specific diagnostic data captured.

To disable FTDC, start up the :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` or 
:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` with the 
``diagnosticDataCollectionEnabled: false`` option specified to the 
:setting:`setParameter` setting in your configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   setParameter:
     diagnosticDataCollectionEnabled: false

Disabling FTDC may increase the time or resources required when 
analyzing or debugging issues with support from MongoDB Inc. engineers.
