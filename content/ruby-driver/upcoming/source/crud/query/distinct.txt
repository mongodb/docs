Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to retrieve the
distinct values of a specified field across a collection.

Within a collection, documents might contain different values for a
single field. For example, one document in a ``restaurants`` collection has a
``borough`` value of ``'Manhattan'``, and another has a ``borough`` value of
``'Queens'``. You can use the {+driver-short+} to retrieve all the unique values
that a field contains across multiple documents in a collection.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your {+language+} application, create a ``Mongo::Client`` object that connects to
an Atlas cluster and assign the following values to your ``database`` and ``collection``
variables:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/distinct.rb
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-db-coll
   :end-before: end-db-coll

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Retrieve Distinct Values
------------------------

To retrieve the distinct values for a specified field, call the ``distinct``
method and pass in the name of the field you want to find distinct values for.

Retrieve Values Across a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example retrieves the distinct values of the ``borough`` field in
the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/read/distinct.rb
      :start-after: start-distinct
      :end-before: end-distinct
      :language: ruby
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      Bronx
      Brooklyn
      Manhattan
      Missing
      Queens
      Staten Island

The operation returns an array that stores each distinct ``borough`` field value. Although
several documents have the same value in the ``borough`` field, each value appears in the
results only once.

Retrieve Values Across Specified Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide a **query filter** to the ``distinct`` method to find the distinct
field values across a subset of documents in a collection. A query filter is an expression
that specifies search criteria used to match documents in an operation. 

.. tip::

   To learn more about creating a query filter, see the :ref:`ruby-specify-query`
   guide.

The following example retrieves the distinct values of the ``borough`` field for
all documents that have a ``cuisine`` field value of ``'Italian'``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/read/distinct.rb
      :start-after: start-distinct-with-query
      :end-before: end-distinct-with-query
      :language: ruby
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :visible: false

      Bronx
      Brooklyn
      Manhattan
      Queens
      Staten Island

Modify Distinct Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``distinct`` method by passing a
``Hash`` object that specifies option values. The following table describes the
options you can set to customize the operation:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Description

   * - ``collation`` 
     - | The collation to use for the operation.
       | **Type**: ``Hash``

   * - ``max_time_ms``
     - | The maximum amount of time in milliseconds that the operation can run.
       | **Type**: ``Integer``

   * - ``read``
     - | The read preference to use for the operation. To learn more, see
         :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
       | **Type**: ``Hash``
   
   * - ``session``
     - | The session to use for the operation.
       | **Type**: ``Session``

The following example retrieves the distinct values of the ``name`` field for
all documents that have a ``borough`` field value of ``'Bronx'`` and a
``cuisine`` field value of ``'Pizza'``. It also sets the ``read`` option,
which instructs the operation to use a ``primary_preferred``
read preference:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/read/distinct.rb
      :start-after: start-distinct-with-opts
      :end-before: end-distinct-with-opts
      :language: ruby
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :visible: false

      $1.25 Pizza
      18 East Gunhill Pizza
      2 Bros
      Aenos Pizza
      Alitalia Pizza Restaurant
      Amici Pizza And Pasta
      Angie'S Cafe Pizza
      Anthony & Joe'S Pizza
      Anthony'S Pizza
      Antivari Pizza
      Arturo'S Pizza
      Bartow Pizza
      ...
