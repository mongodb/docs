Before You Get Started
----------------------

To run the code examples in this guide, complete the :ref:`Quick Start <laravel-quick-start>`
tutorial. This tutorial provides instructions on setting up a MongoDB Atlas instance with
sample data and creating the following files in your Laravel web application:

- ``Movie.php`` file, which contains a ``Movie`` model to represent documents in the ``movies``
  collection
- ``MovieController.php`` file, which contains a ``show()`` function to run database operations
- ``browse_movies.blade.php`` file, which contains HTML code to display the results of database
  operations

The following sections describe how to edit the files in your Laravel application to run
the find operation code examples and view the expected output.
