|service| provides various instance sizes to support different use
cases:

- For starter environments, ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` instance sizes.
  These instances provide access to a subset of |service| features
  and functionality. For a complete list of ``M0``, ``M2``, and
  ``M5`` instance limitations, see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`.

- For low traffic websites and development, ``M10`` and ``M20`` instance sizes.

- For production environments that support high traffic applications or
  large datasets, ``M30`` or larger instances sizes.
