The Compass Home screen provides details regarding the
MongoDB instances to which Compass is connected. 

.. note::

   Starting in version 1.44.0, you can connect to multiple MongoDB
   instances at once through Compass. When you activate multiple
   connections, Compass displays each active connection in a separate
   tab. 

The Compass Home screen includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Connections Sidebar <connections-sidebar>`

- Your :ref:`saved queries and aggregation pipelines <view-favorite-queries>`. 

Once connected to a MongoDB instance, you can reach the Compass
Home screen by clicking a cluster name in the :guilabel:`Connections
Sidebar`. 

Connections Sidebar
-------------------

The :guilabel:`Connections Sidebar` on the left of the Compass window
contains a list of your favorite and saved connections. Active
connections have a green dot next to their name. 

For more information on interacting with your connections, see
:ref:`connections-sidebar`.
