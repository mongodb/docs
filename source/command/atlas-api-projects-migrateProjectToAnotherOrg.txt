`Public Preview: please provide feedback at <https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/930808-atlas-cli>`_: Migrates a project from its current organization to another organization.

All project users and their roles will be copied to the same project in the destination organization. You must include an organization API key with the Organization Owner role for the destination organization to verify access to the destination organization when you authenticate with Programmatic API Keys. Otherwise, the requesting user must have the Organization Owner role in both organizations. To use this resource, the requesting API Key must have the Organization Owner role.

This command is autogenerated and corresponds 1:1 with the Atlas API endpoint https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2/#tag/Projects/operation/migrateProjectToAnotherOrg.

For more information and examples, see the referenced API documentation linked above.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 10 10 60

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Required
     - Description
   * - --envelope
     - envelope
     - false
     - Flag that indicates whether Application wraps the response in an envelope JSON object. Some API clients cannot access the HTTP response headers or status code. To remediate this, set envelope=true in the query. Endpoints that return a list of results use the results object as an envelope. Application adds the status parameter to the response body.
   * - --file
     - string
     - false
     - path to your API request file. Leave empty to use standard input instead - you must provide one or the other, but not both.
   * - --groupId
     - string
     - true
     - Unique 24-hexadecimal digit string that identifies your project. Use the [/groups](#tag/Projects/operation/listProjects) endpoint to retrieve all projects to which the authenticated user has access.
       
       **NOTE**: Groups and projects are synonymous terms. Your group id is the same as your project id. For existing groups, your group/project id remains the same. The resource and corresponding endpoints use the term groups.

     - string
     - false
     - api version to use when calling the api call [options: "2024-05-30"], defaults to the latest version or the profiles api_version config value if set This value defaults to "2024-05-30".
