  Pass the replacement document as the second parameter to the
  :method:`~db.collection.update()` method. 

  The replacement document does not include the ``_id`` field since the
  ``_id`` field is immutable. If you do include the ``_id`` field, it
  must be the same value as the existing value.

  The replacement document can have different fields from the original
  document.

  The update operation returns a :method:`WriteResult` object which
  contains the status of the operation. A successful update of the
  document returns the following object:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
     WriteResult({ "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 })

  The :data:`~WriteResult.nMatched` field specifies the number of
  existing documents matched for the update, and
  :data:`~WriteResult.nModified` specifies the number of
  existing documents modified.
 
  If the operation encounters an error, the :method:`WriteResult`
  object will contain the error information.
