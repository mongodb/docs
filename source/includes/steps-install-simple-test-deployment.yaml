stepnum: 1
ref: set-up-server
content: |
  - The server must have 15 GB of memory and 50 GB of disk space for the  root partition. You can meet the size requirements by using an Amazon Web Services EC2 ``m3.xlarge`` instance and changing the size of the root partition from 8 GB to 50 GB. When you log into the instance, execute "``df -h``" to verify the root partition has 50 GB of space.

  - You must have root access to the server.
