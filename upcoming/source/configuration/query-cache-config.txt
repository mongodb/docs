Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to configure your application to use
query cache middleware. Query cache middleware allows you to
activate the :ref:`mongoid-query-cache` for each request to store your
query results. This can improve your application speed and efficiency by
reducing the number of calls your application must make to the database.

Enable Query Cache for Rack Web Requests
----------------------------------------

The {+ruby-driver+} provides a Rack middleware which enables the
query cache during each web request. The
following code demonstrates how to enable the Query Cache Middleware in
a {+ror+} application:

.. code-block:: ruby
   :caption: config/application.rb

   # Add Mongo::QueryCache::Middleware at the bottom of the middleware
   # stack or before other middleware that queries MongoDB.
   config.middleware.use Mongo::QueryCache::Middleware

To learn more about using Rack middleware in Rails applications, see
`Configuring Middleware Stack
<{+active-record-docs+}/rails_on_rack.html#configuring-middleware-stack>`__
in the Rails documentation.

Enable Query Cache for Active Job
---------------------------------

The {+ruby-driver+} provides Query Cache Middleware for `Active Job
<{+active-record-docs+}/active_job_basics.html>`__.
You can enable it for all jobs in an initializer, as shown in the
following code:

.. code-block:: ruby
   :caption: config/initializers/active_job.rb

   # Enable Mongo driver query cache for Active Job
   ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_job) do
     include Mongo::QueryCache::Middleware::ActiveJob
   end

You can also enable it for a specific job class, as shown in the
following code:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class MyJob < ActiveJob::Base
     include Mongo::QueryCache::Middleware::ActiveJob
   end
