Create a Sample Collection and Load the Data 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must begin by creating a collection named ``schools`` in an 
existing or new database on your |service| {+cluster+}. After creating the 
collection, you must upload the sample data into your collection. To
learn more about the documents in the sample collection, see
:ref:`embedded-documents-tutorial-sample-collection`. 

The steps in this section walk you through creating a new database 
and collection, and loading the sample data into your collection.

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-data-explorer.rst

   .. step:: Create a new collection. 

      a. Click :guilabel:`Create Database` to create a new database.
      #. Enter the database name and collection name.
         
         - In the :guilabel:`Database Name` field, specify
           ``local_school_district``.
         - For the :guilabel:`Collection Name` field, specify
           ``schools``.

   .. step:: Load the following documents into the collection. 

      a. Select the ``schools`` collection if it's not selected.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Insert Document` for each of the sample 
         documents to add to the collection.
      #. Click the |json| view (:guilabel:`{}`) to replace the default 
         document.
      #. Copy and paste the following sample documents, one at a time, 
         and click :guilabel:`Insert` to add the documents, one at a 
         time, to the collection.
