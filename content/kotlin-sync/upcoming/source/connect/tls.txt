Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the 
:wikipedia:`TLS <w/index.php?title=Transport_Layer_Security&oldid=1239598620>`
security protocol when connecting to MongoDB by using the {+driver-short+}.

.. _kotlin-sync-tls-enable:

Enable TLS
----------

You can enable TLS on a connection to your MongoDB instance
in the following ways:

- Setting the ``tls`` parameter in your connection string
- Using the ``enabled()`` method from the ``SslSettings.Builder`` class when creating a
  ``MongoClientSettings`` instance

.. note:: DNS Seedlist Protocol Enables TLS

   If you connect by using the DNS seedlist protocol, indicated by the
   ``mongodb+srv`` prefix in your connection string, the driver
   automatically enables TLS.

   To learn more about connection behavior when you use a DNS seedlist,
   see the :manual:`SRV Connection Format </reference/connection-string/#srv-connection-format>`
   section of the Connection Strings guide in the Server manual.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: connectionstring

      To enable TLS on a connection by using a connection string, set the
      ``tls`` option to ``true`` in the options parameter and pass the string to
      ``MongoClient.create()``, as shown in the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.kt
         :start-after: start-tls-connection-string
         :end-before: end-tls-connection-string
         :language: kotlin
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

   .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
      :tabid: mongoclientsettings

      To enable TLS within a ``MongoClientSettings`` instance, use the
      ``applyToSslSettings()`` builder method. Set the ``enabled`` property to ``true``
      in the ``SslSettings.Builder`` block, as shown in the following code:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.kt
         :start-after: start-tls-mongo-client-settings
         :end-before: end-tls-mongo-client-settings
         :language: kotlin
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

.. note:: Debugging TLS

   If you experience trouble setting up your TLS connection, you can
   use the ``-Djavax.net.debug=all`` system property to view helpful
   log statements. See `Debugging SSL/TLS connections
   <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/ReadDebug.html>`__
   in the Java language documentation for more information.

.. _tls_configure-certificates:

Configure Certificates
----------------------

{+language+} applications that initiate TLS requests require access to
cryptographic certificates that prove the application's identity and verify
other applications with which the {+language+} application interacts. You can configure
access to these certificates in your application in the following ways:

- Using a JVM trust store and JVM key store
- Using a client-specific trust store and key store

.. _kotlin-sync-tls-configure-jvm-truststore:

Configure the JVM Trust Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   By default, the JRE includes many commonly used public certificates
   from signing authorities such as `Let's Encrypt
   <https://letsencrypt.org/>`__. As a result, you can enable TLS when connecting to a
   :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` instance, or any other
   server whose certificate is signed by an authority in the JRE's default
   certificate store, with TLS enabled without configuring the trust store.

The JVM trust store saves certificates that securely identify other
applications with which your {+language+} application interacts. By using these
certificates, your application can prove that the connection to another
application is genuine and secure from tampering by third parties.

If your MongoDB instance uses a certificate that is signed by an
authority that is not present in the JRE's default certificate store,
your application must configure the following system properties to initiate
TLS requests.

- ``javax.net.ssl.trustStore``: Path to a trust store containing the client's TLS
  certificates

- ``javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword``: Password to access the trust
  store defined in ``javax.net.ssl.trustStore``

These properties ensure that your application can
validate the TLS certificate presented by a connected MongoDB instance.

You can create a trust store by using the `keytool <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html>`__
command line tool from the JDK as shown in the following terminal command:

.. code-block:: console

   keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -file <path to certificate authority file>
            -keystore <path to trust store> -storepass <password>

Configure the JVM Key Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   By default, MongoDB instances do not perform client certificate
   validation. You must configure the key store if you configured your MongoDB
   instance to validate client certificates.

An application that initiates TLS requests must set the following JVM system
properties to ensure that the client presents a TLS certificate to
the MongoDB server:

- ``javax.net.ssl.keyStore``: Path to a key store containing the client's
  TLS/SSL certificates

- ``javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword``: Password to access the key store
  defined in ``javax.net.ssl.keyStore``

You can create a key store by using the `keytool
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html>`__
or `openssl <https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl.html>`__
command line tool.

To learn more about configuring a {+language+} application to use TLS,
see the `JSSE Reference Guide <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html>`__
in the Java language documentation.

.. _tls-disable-hostname-verification:

Configure a Client-Specific Trust Store and Key Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure a client-specific trust store and key store by using the
``init()`` method of the ``SSLContext`` class.

Find an example showing how to configure a client to use an ``SSLContext``
instance in the :ref:`<kotlin-sync-tls-custom-sslContext>` section of this guide.

Disable Hostname Verification
-----------------------------

By default, the driver ensures that the hostname included in the server's
TLS certificates matches the hostnames provided when constructing
a ``MongoClient``. To disable hostname verification for your
application, set the ``invalidHostNameAllowed`` property of the builder to ``true`` in the
``applytoSslSettings()`` builder block:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.kt
   :start-after: start-disable-hostname-verification
   :end-before: end-disable-hostname-verification
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. warning::

   Disabling hostname verification makes your application insecure and potentially
   vulnerable to expired certificates and foreign processes posing as valid client
   instances.

.. _kotlin-sync-tls-restrict-tls-1.2:

Restrict Connections to TLS 1.2 Only
------------------------------------

To restrict your application to use only the TLS 1.2 protocol, set the
``jdk.tls.client.protocols`` system property to ``"TLSv1.2"``.

.. note::

   Java Runtime Environments (JREs) before Java 8 only enabled
   the TLS 1.2 protocol in update releases. If your JRE has not enabled
   the TLS 1.2 protocol, upgrade to a later release to connect by using
   TLS 1.2.

.. _kotlin-sync-tls-custom-sslContext:

Customize TLS Configuration through the Java SE SSLContext
----------------------------------------------------------

If your TLS configuration requires customization, you can
set the ``sslContext`` property of your ``MongoClient`` by
passing an `SSLContext
<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/SSLContext.html>`__
object to the ``context()`` method builder in the ``applyToSslSettings()`` block:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.kt
   :start-after: start-ssl-context
   :end-before: end-ssl-context
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

For more information on the ``SSLContext`` class, see the API
documentation for `SSL Context <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/javax/net/ssl/SSLContext.html>`__.

Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
-----------------------------------------

OCSP is a standard used to check whether X.509 certificates have been
revoked. A certificate authority can add an X.509 certificate to the
Certificate Revocation List (CRL) before the expiry time to invalidate
the certificate. When a client sends an X.509 certificate during the TLS
handshake, the CA's revocation server checks the CRL and returns a status
of ``good``, ``revoked``, or ``unknown``.

The driver supports the following variations of OCSP:

- Client-Driven OCSP
- OCSP Stapling

The following sections describe the differences between them and how to enable
them for your application.

.. note::

   The {+driver-short+} uses the JVM arguments configured for the application
   and cannot be overridden for a specific ``MongoClient`` instance.

Client-Driven OCSP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In client-driven OCSP, the client sends the certificate in an OCSP request to
an OCSP responder after receiving the certificate from the server. The OCSP
responder checks the status of the certificate with a certificate
authority (CA) and reports whether it's valid in a response sent to the
client.

To enable client-driven OCSP for your application, set the following JVM
system properties:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - Property
     - Value

   * - ``com.sun.net.ssl.checkRevocation``
     - Set this property to ``true`` to enable revocation checking.

   * - ``ocsp.enable``
     - Set this property to ``true`` to enable client-driven OCSP.

.. warning::

   If the OCSP responder is unavailable, the TLS support provided by the
   JDK reports a "hard fail". This differs from the "soft fail" behavior of
   the MongoDB Shell and some other drivers.

OCSP Stapling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OCSP stapling is a mechanism in which the server must obtain the signed
certificate from the certificate authority (CA) and include it in a
time-stamped OCSP response to the client.

To enable OCSP stapling for your application, set the following JVM system
properties:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``com.sun.net.ssl.checkRevocation``
     - Set this property to ``true`` to enable revocation checking.

   * - ``jdk.tls.client.enableStatusRequestExtension``
     - | Set this property to ``true`` to enable OCSP stapling.
       |
       | If unset or set to ``false``, the connection can proceed regardless of the presence or status of the certificate revocation response.
