``stream``
----------

``str::stream()`` is quite useful for assembling strings inline:

.. code-block:: cpp

   uassert(12345, str::stream() << "bad ns:" << ns, isOk);

``StringData``
--------------

.. code-block:: cpp

   /** A StringData object wraps a 'const std::string&' or a 'const char*' without
    * copying its contents. The most common usage is as a function argument that
    * takes any of the two forms of strings above. Fundamentally, this class tries
    * to work around the fact that string literals in C++ are char[N]'s.
    *
    * Important: the object StringData wraps must remain alive while the StringData
    * is.

   class StringData {
