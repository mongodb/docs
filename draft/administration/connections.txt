This document describes the URI format for defining connections between
applications and MongoDB instances in the official MongoDB :doc:`drivers
</applications/drivers>`.

Standard Connection String Format
---------------------------------

This section describes the standard format of the MongoDB connection URI
used to connect to a MongoDB database server. The format is the same for
all official MongoDB drivers. For a list of drivers and links to driver
documentation, see :doc:`/applications/drivers`.

The following is the standard URI connection scheme:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]

.. example:: In the following example, a connection
   logs into two members in the ``test`` replica set:

   .. code-block:: none

      mongodb://db1.example.com,db2.example.com:2500/?replicaSet=test

- ``mongodb:// `` is a required prefix to identify that this is a string
  in the standard connection format.

- ``username:password@`` are optional. If they are given,
  :program:`mongod` attempts to log in to a specific database after
  connecting to a database server.

- ``host1`` is the only required part of the URI. It identifies a server
  address to connect to. It identifies either a hostname, IP address, or
  UNIX domain socket.

- ``:port1`` is optional and defaults to ``:27017`` if not provided.

- ``hostX`` is optional. You can specify as many hosts as necessary. You
  would specify multiple hosts, for example, for connections to replica
  sets.

- ``:portX`` is optional and defaults to ``:27017`` if not provided.

- ``/database`` is the name of the database to log in to. This is
  relevant only if the ``username:password@`` syntax is used. If
  ``/database`` is not specified, the ``admin`` database is used by
  default.

- ``?options`` are connection options, as described in
  :ref:`connections-connection-options`.

  If the ``database`` string is absent you must still have a ``/``
  between the last ``hostN`` and the ``?`` introducing the options.

Connection Options
------------------

The connection options used in the
:ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format` are listed in this
section. The options are not case-sensitive.

Connection options are name=value pairs. The pairs are separated by "&".
For backwards compatibility, ``;`` is accepted as a separator. But ``;``
is deprecated.

.. example:: In the following example, a connection
   uses the ``replicaSet`` and ``connectTimeoutMS`` options.

   .. code-block:: none

      mongodb://db1.example.com,db2.example.com:2500/?replicaSet=test&connectTimeoutMS=300000

Replica Set Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: replicaSet

   Specifies the name of the :term:`replica set`, if the
   :program:`mongod` is a member of a replica set.

   When connecting to a replica set it is important to give a seed list
   of at least two :program:`mongod` instances.

Connection Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: ssl

   ``true``: Initiate the connection with SSL.

   ``false``: Initiate the connection without SSL.

   .. todo Determine whether ``prefer`` option exists. Check with server
      team whether it's possible to do rolling restarts of a cluster to
      turn on SSL. Here is the option
      ``prefer``: Initiate the connection with SSL, but if that fails initiate without SSL.

   The default value is ``false``.

   .. note:: The :data:`ssl` option is not supported by all drivers. For information on your
      driver, see the :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>` documentation.

.. data:: connectTimeoutMS

   The time in milliseconds to attempt a connection before timing out.
   The default is never to timeout, though different drivers might vary.
   See the :doc:`/applications/drivers` documentation.

.. data:: socketTimeoutMS

   The time in milliseconds to attempt a send or receive on a socket
   before the attempt times out. The default is never to timeout, though
   different drivers might vary. See the :doc:`/applications/drivers`
   documentation.

Connection Pool Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The server uses one thread per TCP connection, therefore it is highly
recommended that your application use some sort of connection pooling.
Most drivers handle this for you behind the scenes. Some drivers do not
support connection pools. See the :doc:`/applications/drivers`
documentation.

.. data:: maxPoolSize

   The maximum number of connections in the connection pool. The default
   value is ``100``.

.. data:: minPoolSize

   The minimum number of connections in the connection pool. The default
   value is ``0``.

   .. note:: The :data:`minPoolSize` option is not supported by all
      drivers. For information on your driver, see the :doc:`drivers
      </applications/drivers>` documentation.

.. data:: maxIdleTimeMS

   The maximum number of milliseconds that a connection can remain idle
   in the pool before being removed and closed.

.. data:: waitQueueMultiple

   A multiplier number that is multiplied with the
   ``maxPoolSize`` setting to give the maximum number of threads allowed
   to wait for a connection to become available from the pool. For
   default values, see the :doc:`/applications/drivers` documentation.

.. data:: waitQueueTimeoutMS

   The maximum time in milliseconds that a thread is allowed to wait for
   a connection to become available. For
   default values, see the :doc:`/applications/drivers` documentation.

Write Concern Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a full explanation of write concern, see
:ref:`write-operations-write-concern`.

.. data:: w

   Used by the :dbcommand:`getLastError` command either to configure
   write concern on members of :term:`replica sets <replica set>` *or*
   to disable write concern entirely. This option can take either a
   number or a string as a value.

   ``0``: Disables write concern. If you disable write concern but
   enable the :dbcommand:`getLastError` command's ``journal`` option, the
   journal option prevails and write concern with journaling is enabled.

   ``1``: Enables write concern on a standalone :program:`mongod` or the
    :term:`primary` in a replica set. *This is the default setting.*

   *A number greater than 1*: Confirms that write operations have
   replicated to the specified number of replica set members, including
   the primary. If you set ``w`` to a number that is greater than the
   number of set members that hold data, MongoDB waits for the
   non-existent members become available, which means the write
   operation blocks indefinitely.

   ``majority``: Confirms that write operations have replicated to the
   majority of set members.

   ``-1``: Turns off reporting of network errors.

.. data:: wtimeoutMS

   The time in milliseconds to wait for replication to succeed, as
   specified in the ``w`` option, before timing out.

.. data:: journal

   ``true``: Sync to journal.

   Confirm that the :program:`mongod` instance has written the data to
   the on-disk journal. This is equivalent to specifying the
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` command with the ``j`` option enabled.

    ``false``: Does not confirm that data is written to the on-disk
    journal.

    The default value is ``false``.

    If you enable the ``journal``option but have not enabled write concern through
    the ``w`` option, the journal option prevails and write concern with
    journaling is enabled.

Read Preference Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a full explanation of read preferences, see
:ref:`replica-set-read-preference`.

.. data:: readPreference

   Specifies the :term:`replica set` read preference for this
   connection. This setting overrides any ``slaveOk`` value. The read
   preference values are the following:

   - :readmode:`primary`
   - :readmode:`primaryPreferred`
   - :readmode:`secondary`
   - :readmode:`secondaryPreferred`
   - :readmode:`nearest`

   For descriptions of each value, see
   :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-modes`.

   The default value is :readmode:`primary`, which sends all read
   operations to the replica set's :term:`primary`.

.. data:: readPreferenceTags

   Specifies a tag set as a comma-separated list of
   colon-separated key-value pairs. For example:

   .. code-block:: none

      dc:ny,rack:1

   To specify a *list* of tag sets, use multiple ``readPreferenceTags``.
   The following specifies two tag sets and an empty tag set:

   .. code-block:: none

      readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:1&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny&readPreferenceTags=

   Order matters when using multiple ``readPreferenceTags``.

Miscellaneous Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: uuidRepresentation

   ``standard``: The standard binary representation.

   ``csharpLegacy``: The default representation for the C# driver.

   ``javaLegacy``: The default representation for the Java driver.

   ``pythonLegacy``: The default representation for the Python driver.

   For the default, see the :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>`
   documentation for your driver.

   .. note:: The :data:`uuidRepresentation` option is not supported by
      all drivers. For information on your driver, see the :doc:`drivers
      </applications/drivers>` documentation.
