This code performs the following actions:

- Imports Semantic Kernel and all the required packages.

- Connects to your |service| {+cluster+} by retrieving your |srv| :manual:`connection string 
  </reference/connection-string/#find-your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string>` from the environment.

- Retrieves your OpenAI API key from the environment
  and creates an instance of OpenAI's ``text-embedding-ada-002`` embedding model.

- Instantiates |service| as a memory store and specifies the following parameters:

  - ``semantic_kernel_db.records`` as the collection to store the documents.
  - ``vector_index`` as the index to use for querying the memory store.

- Populates the ``semantic_kernel_db.records`` collection with sample documents by calling the
  ``CreateCollectionFromListAsync`` method.

- Defines a variable ``recordCollection`` containing the ``semantic_kernel_db.records`` collection.

- Creates two helper methods to help store and retrieve text in memory:

  - ``CreateRecord``: A factory to create a new ``DataModel`` object.
  - ``CreateCollectionFromListAsync``: A method to take string entries, generate
    embeddings for the strings, create corresponding records, and then upsert those
    records into a collection in your |service| {+cluster+}.

- Creates a ``DataModel`` class that defines the structure of documents stored in the
  MongoDB collection.
