.. dbcommand:: collStats

   The :dbcommand:`collStats` command returns a variety of storage statistics
   for a given collection.

   .. |command| replace:: ``collStats``

   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand.rst

   The :dbcommand:`collStats` command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         collStats: <string>,
         scale: <int>
      }

   The command takes the following fields:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-collStats-field.rst

   .. note::

      Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB removes the MMAPv1 storage
      engine. In conjunction with this change, MongoDB removes the
      MMAPv1 specific :dbcommand:`collStats` option ``verbose``.

Behavior
--------

Accuracy after Unexpected Shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |cmd| replace:: :dbcommand:`collStats`
.. |opt| replace:: size

.. include:: /includes/fact-unexpected-shutdown-accuracy.rst

In-Progress Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the :dbcommand:`collStats` includes
information on indexes currently being built. For details, see:

- :data:`collStats.nindexes`
- :data:`collStats.indexDetails`
- :data:`collStats.indexBuilds`
- :data:`collStats.totalIndexSize`
- :data:`collStats.indexSizes`
   
Example
-------

The following operation runs the :dbcommand:`collStats` command on the
``restaurants`` collection, specifying a scale of ``1024`` bytes:

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.runCommand( { collStats : "restaurants", scale: 1024 } )

The following document provides a representation of the
:dbcommand:`collStats` output. Depending on the configuration of your
collection and the storage engine, the output fields may vary.

.. _collStats-output:

Output
------

.. data:: collStats.ns

   The namespace of the current collection, which follows the format
   ``[database].[collection]``.

.. data:: collStats.size

   The total uncompressed size in memory of all records in a
   collection. The :data:`~collStats.size` does not
   include the size of any indexes associated with the collection,
   which the :data:`~collStats.totalIndexSize` field reports.

   The ``scale`` argument affects this value. Data compression does not
   affect this value.

.. data:: collStats.count

   The number of objects or documents in this collection.


.. data:: collStats.avgObjSize

   The average size of an object in the collection. The ``scale``
   argument does not affect this value.

.. data:: collStats.storageSize

   The total amount of storage allocated to this collection for
   :term:`document` storage. The ``scale`` argument affects this
   value.

   If collection data is compressed (which is the :option:`default for
   WiredTiger <mongod --wiredTigerCollectionBlockCompressor>`), the
   storage size reflects the compressed size and may be smaller than
   the value for :data:`collStats.size`.

   :data:`~collStats.storageSize` does not include index size. See
   :data:`~collStats.totalIndexSize` for index sizing.

.. data:: collStats.nindexes

   The number of indexes on the collection. All collections have at
   least one index on the :term:`_id` field.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, :data:`~collStats.nindexes` includes in its
   count those indexes currently being built.

.. data:: collStats.indexDetails

   .. versionadded:: 3.0.0

   A document that reports data from the :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredTiger>`
   storage engine for each index in the collection. Other storage engines will
   return an empty document.

   The fields in this document are the names of the indexes, while the
   values themselves are documents that contain statistics for the
   index provided by the storage engine. These statistics are for
   internal diagnostic use.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, :data:`~collStats.indexDetails` includes
   details on indexes currently being built.

.. data:: collStats.indexBuilds

   An array that contains the names of the indexes that are currently
   being built on the collection. Once an index build completes, the
   index does not appear in the :data:`~collStats.indexBuilds`.

   .. versionadded:: 4.2

.. data:: collStats.totalIndexSize

   The total size of all indexes. The ``scale`` argument affects this
   value.

   If an index uses prefix compression (which is the :option:`default
   for WiredTiger <mongod --wiredTigerIndexPrefixCompression>`), the
   returned size reflects the compressed size for any such indexes when
   calculating the total.
   
   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, :data:`~collStats.totalIndexSize` includes
   in its total the size of those indexes currently being built.

.. data:: collStats.indexSizes

   This field specifies the key and size of every existing index on
   the collection. The ``scale`` argument affects this value.

   If an index uses prefix compression (which is the :option:`default
   for WiredTiger <mongod --wiredTigerIndexPrefixCompression>`), the
   returned size reflects the compressed size.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, :data:`~collStats.indexSizes` includes
   sizes of indexes currently being built.

.. data:: collStats.capped

   This field will be "true" if the collection is
   :term:`capped <capped collection>`.

.. data:: collStats.max

   Shows the maximum number of documents that may be present in a
   :term:`capped collection`.

.. data:: collStats.maxSize

   Shows the maximum size of a :term:`capped collection`.

.. data:: collStats.wiredTiger

   .. versionadded:: 3.0.0

   :data:`~collStats.wiredTiger` only appears when using the
   WiredTiger storage engine.

   This document contains data reported
   directly by the WiredTiger engine and other data for internal
   diagnostic use.
