|mms| uses Automation to manage your deployments but can monitor and
back up your deployments without Automation.

If you no longer want to use |mms| for one or both of these 
capabilities, you can stop |mms| from either:

- Managing your deployment while *still* monitoring it and backing it
  up, or
- Managing, monitoring, *and* backing up your deployment 

After you stop |mms| from managing a deployment, you cannot use |mms| 
to upgrade, stop, start, or change that deploymentâ€™s configuration in 
any way. If you want to
:doc:`shut down your deployment </tutorial/shut-down-deployment>`
before stop |mms| from managing it, *do that first*. Otherwise, you
must connect to each process using the |mongo| shell to
:manual:`shut down the process </reference/command/shutdown>` directly.

If you stop using |mms| to monitor your deployment, any associated 
snapshots are deleted and all historic monitoring data is removed.

Stopping |mms| from managing or monitoring your deployment does not
affect the deployment's |mongod| and |mongos| processes. These
processes continue to run uninterrupted unless you explicitly shut it
down first.

Considerations
--------------

Script Deployment after Disabling Automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are disabling automation for a deployment and want to
stop and start the deployment from another host afterward, you can
:doc:`create scripts </tutorial/suspend-automation>` for stopping
and starting the deployment.

.. cond:: cloud

   Disable All Deployments

Prerequisites
-------------

This tutorial explains how to stop |mms| Automation from managing your
deployment. You may need to complete some additional tasks before you 
remove your deployment from |mms| Automation. The following table 
highlights which actions you need to take before starting this 
tutorial.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - If you want to...
     - You first need to...
   * - Stop monitoring a deployment
     - :ref:`Stop backing up the deployment <terminate-backup>`
   * - Terminate a deployment
     - :doc:`Shut down the deployment </tutorial/shut-down-deployment>`
   * - Stop |mms| from managing a Sharded Cluster
     - Shut down any :binary:`~bin.mongos` processes associated with
       a sharded cluster.

       .. cond:: cloud

          The :guilabel:`Remove from Cloud Manager` option is
          unavailable for running :binary:`~bin.mongos` processes.

       .. cond:: onprem

          The :guilabel:`Remove from Ops Manager` option is
          unavailable for running :binary:`~bin.mongos` processes.

Procedure
---------

.. note::

   As an alternative to disabling automation for a deployment,
   you can temporarily :doc:`suspend </tutorial/suspend-automation>`
   automation for that deployment. 

   This is useful if you need to temporarily shut down the deployment 
   for maintenance, and do not want |mms| to automatically start the 
   deployment back up until you are ready.
