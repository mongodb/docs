.. _java-connection-certificate:

Security Certificate Errors
---------------------------

If you use Java version 8 or earlier, you might need to add a
certificate to your trust store. You can either upgrade to a later
version of the JDK or read the :atlas:`Security FAQ
</reference/faq/security/#java-users>` instructions in the Atlas
documentation for information on how to add the certificate.

.. _java-timeout-errors:

Timeout Errors
--------------

When you send messages through the driver to the server, sometimes the
messages take a while to respond. When this happens, you might receive an error
message similar to one of the following messages:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Timed out after 30000 ms while waiting for a server that matches ReadPreferenceServerSelector{readPreference=primary}.

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   No server chosen by ReadPreferenceServerSelector{readPreference=primary} from cluster description

If you receive one of these errors, try the following methods to resolve the
issue.

Set ``maxConnectionTimeoutMS``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``maxConnectionTimeoutMS`` option indicates the time the Java driver waits
for a connection before timing out. The default value is ``10000``. You can
increase this value or set it to ``0`` if you want the driver to never timeout.

Set ``maxConnectionLifeTime`` and ``maxConnectionIdleTime``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider setting ``maxConnectionLifeTime`` and
``maxConnectionIdleTime``. These parameters configure how long the driver
maintains a connection to a MongoDB instance. For more information about these
parameters, see :ref:`Connection Pool Settings <mcs-connectionpool-settings>`.

.. _java-server-selection-errors:

Server Selection Timeout Exceptions
-----------------------------------

Your application might not be able to complete a request even when some servers
are available, causing the driver to return a server selection timeout
exception.

This exception is of type ``MongoTimeoutException``. The following
shows a sample of the exception that occurs if you attempt to send a
request to a replica set in which the primary is not reachable:

.. code-block:: none

   com.mongodb.MongoTimeoutException:
   Timed out while waiting for a server that matches ReadPreferenceServerSelector{readPreference=primary}.
   Client view of cluster state is
   {type=REPLICA_SET,
    servers=[
     {address=localhost:27017, type=UNKNOWN, state=CONNECTING, exception={com.mongodb.MongoSocketOpenException: Exception opening socket}, caused by {java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused}},
     {address=localhost:27018, type=UNKNOWN, state=CONNECTING, exception={com.mongodb.MongoSocketOpenException: Exception opening socket}, caused by {java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused}},
     {address=localhost:27019, type=REPLICA_SET_SECONDARY, roundTripTime=15.0 ms, state=CONNECTED}
    ]
   }

The error includes a view of the cluster state that describes the
connection state of each node, which can help you identify the source of
your connection issue.

In the preceding error, the only connected server, ``localhost:27019``,
is a secondary node. Because of this, the request times out as the
driver is unable to select a server that satisfies the read preference
of ``primary``. In this situation, you can still perform read operations
against the connected secondary node if you set the read preference to
``secondary``, ``secondaryPreferred``, or ``nearest``.

You can also specify the ``serverSelectionTimeoutMS`` connection option
to adjust the amount of time in which the driver must select a server. To
learn more, see the :ref:`java-connection-uri-options` guide.

.. _java-miscellaneous-errors:

Miscellaneous Errors
--------------------

This section shows connection errors that do not fall into a broader category.

Monitor Thread Exception
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   INFO: Exception in monitor thread while connecting to server ssc-cluster-01-shard-00-02.9cbnp.mongodb.net:27017

This log line indicates that the monitor that continuously
checks the status of each replica set member or ``mongos`` server failed to
contact one of the nodes or servers. This is an expected message during server
maintenance operations and can be safely ignored.

Certificate Request Exception
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: extension (5) should not be presented in certificate_request

This is a known issue in certain versions of the JDK that can occur when
attempting to connect by using the TLS 1.3 protocol.

If you encounter this error when connecting to your MongoDB instance or
cluster, update your JDK to one of the following patch versions or newer:

- JDK 11.0.7
- JDK 13.0.3
- JDK 14.0.2

To learn more about this issue, see the
`issue description <https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8236039>`__
in the OpenJDK Bug system tracker issue.

.. _java-debugging-tips:

Debugging Tips
--------------

While not related to a specific error message, this section includes
information that can help in the process of troubleshooting connection
issues.

Verbose Logging for TLS/SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``-Djavax.net.debug=all`` system property to enable
debug-level logging related to all connections, including those
established by using TLS/SSL.

Enabling debug-level logging can help you diagnose the root problem of
connection issues. To learn more about the TLS/SSL logging messages,
see the `Debugging SSL/TLS Connections <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/ReadDebug.html>`__
Java documentation.
