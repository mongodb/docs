MongoDB supports *compound indexes*, where a single index structure
holds references to multiple fields [#compound-index-field-limit]_
within a collection's documents. The following diagram illustrates an
example of a compound index on two fields:

.. include:: /images/index-compound-key.rst

.. [#compound-index-field-limit]
   MongoDB imposes a :limit:`limit of 32 fields for any compound index
   <Number of Indexed Fields in a Compound Index>`.

Compound indexes can support queries that match on multiple fields.

Create a Compound Index
-----------------------

To create a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` use an
operation that resembles the following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.createIndex( { <field1>: <type>, <field2>: <type2>, ... } )

.. include:: /includes/fact-index-specification-field-value.rst

The order of the indexed fields has a strong impact on the
effectiveness of a particular index for a given query. For most
compound indexes, following the :ref:`ESR (Equality, Sort, Range) rule
<esr-indexing-rule>` helps to create efficient indexes.

.. important:: 

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4: 

   - Compound indexes may contain **a single** :doc:`hashed index field 
     </core/index-hashed>`. 
   - You will receive an error if you attempt to create a compound index 
     that contains more than one :doc:`hashed index field 
     </core/index-hashed>`.

   In MongoDB 4.2 or earlier: 
   
   - Compound indexes may **not** contain a :doc:`hashed index field 
     </core/index-hashed>`. 
   - You will receive an error if you attempt to create a compound index
     that contains a :doc:`hashed index field </core/index-hashed>`.

Consider a collection named ``products`` that holds documents that
resemble the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "_id": ObjectId(...),
    "item": "Banana",
    "category": ["food", "produce", "grocery"],
    "location": "4th Street Store",
    "stock": 4,
    "type": "cases"
   }

The following operation creates an ascending index on the ``item`` and
``stock`` fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.createIndex( { "item": 1, "stock": 1 } )

The order of the fields listed in a compound index is important. The
index will contain references to documents sorted first by the values
of the ``item`` field and, within each value of the ``item`` field, sorted by
values of the stock field. See :ref:`index-ascending-and-descending`
for more information.

In addition to supporting queries that match on all the index fields,
compound indexes can support queries that match on the prefix of the
index fields. That is, the index supports queries on the ``item`` field
as well as both ``item`` and ``stock`` fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.find( { item: "Banana" } )
   db.products.find( { item: "Banana", stock: { $gt: 5 } } )

For details, see :ref:`compound-index-prefix`.


.. _index-ascending-and-descending:

Sort Order
----------

Indexes store references to fields in either ascending (``1``) or
descending (``-1``) sort order. For single-field indexes, the sort
order of keys doesn't matter because MongoDB can traverse the index in
either direction. However, for :ref:`compound indexes
<index-type-compound>`, sort order can matter in determining whether
the index can support a sort operation.

Consider a collection ``events`` that contains documents with the
fields ``username`` and ``date``. Applications can issue queries that
return results sorted first by ascending ``username`` values and then
by descending (i.e. more recent to last) ``date`` values, such as:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.events.find().sort( { username: 1, date: -1 } )

or queries that return results sorted first by descending ``username``
values and then by ascending ``date`` values, such as:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.events.find().sort( { username: -1, date: 1 } )

The following index can support both these sort operations:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.events.createIndex( { "username" : 1, "date" : -1 } )

However, the above index **cannot** support sorting by ascending
``username`` values and then by ascending ``date`` values, such as the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.events.find().sort( { username: 1, date: 1 } )

For more information on sort order and compound indexes, see
:doc:`/tutorial/sort-results-with-indexes`.

.. _compound-index-prefix:

Prefixes
--------

Index prefixes are the *beginning* subsets of indexed fields. For
example, consider the following compound index:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "item": 1, "location": 1, "stock": 1 }

The index has the following index prefixes:

- ``{ item: 1 }``

- ``{ item: 1, location: 1 }``

For a compound index, MongoDB can use the index to support queries on
the index prefixes. As such, MongoDB can use the index for queries on
the following fields:

- the ``item`` field,
- the ``item`` field *and* the ``location`` field,
- the ``item`` field *and* the ``location`` field *and* the ``stock`` field.

MongoDB can also use the index to support a query on the ``item`` and
``stock`` fields, since the ``item`` field corresponds to a prefix.
However, in this case the index would not be as efficient in supporting
the query as it would be if the index were on only ``item`` and
``stock``. Index fields are parsed in order; if a query omits a
particular index prefix, it is unable to make use of any index fields
that follow that prefix.

Since a query on ``item`` and ``stock`` omits the ``location`` index
prefix, it cannot use the ``stock`` index field which follows
``location``.  Only the ``item`` field in the index can support this
query. See :ref:`create-indexes-to-support-queries` for
more information.

MongoDB cannot use the index to support queries that include the
following fields since without the ``item`` field, none of the listed
fields correspond to a prefix index:

- the ``location`` field,

- the ``stock`` field, or

- the ``location`` and ``stock`` fields.

If you have a collection that has both a compound index and an index on
its prefix (e.g. ``{ a: 1, b: 1 }`` and ``{ a: 1 }``), if neither index
has a sparse or unique constraint, then you can remove the index on the
prefix (e.g. ``{ a: 1 }``). MongoDB will use the compound index in all
of the situations that it would have used the prefix index.
