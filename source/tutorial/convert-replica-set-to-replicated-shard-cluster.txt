Sharded clusters partition data across multiple servers based on a
:term:`shard key`. A sharded cluster scales better than a replica set
for deployments with large data sets and high throughput operations.

This tutorial converts a single three-member replica set to a sharded
cluster with two shards. Each shard in the new cluster is an independent
three-member replica set.

About This Task
---------------

- Some steps in this tutorial cause downtime for your deployment.
  Individual steps note when downtime will occur.

- This tutorial is for deployments that have :ref:`authentication
  enabled <authentication>`.

- In this tutorial, you specify server settings with :ref:`configuration
  files <configuration-options>`. Configuration files contain settings
  that are equivalent to the :binary:`mongod` and
  :binary:`mongos` command-line options.

- The sharded cluster you deploy with this tutorial contains ten
  servers:

  - One server for the :binary:`mongos`.

  - Three servers each for the two shards in the cluster (six servers in
    total).

  - Three servers for the :ref:`config server replica set
    <sharding-config-server>`.

Server Architecture

Before You Begin
----------------

- To complete this tutorial, you must have a replica set that uses
  either keyfile or x.509 certificate authentication. To deploy a secure
  replica set that uses one of these authentication methods, see either:

  - :ref:`deploy-repl-set-with-keyfile`
  - :ref:`x509-internal-authentication`

- This tutorial uses the default data directories ``/data/db`` and
  ``/data/configdb``. To use different paths, set the
  :setting:`storage.dbPath` setting in your configuration file.

Steps
-----

.. _convert-setup-initial-set:

1. Get the Existing Users and Roles from the Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get existing users and roles, run ``mongodump``:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodump -d=admin --out=adminDump -u <adminUser> -p <password> --host <replicaSetURI> --dumpDbUsersAndRoles

2. Deploy the Config Server Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploy a three-member replica set for the config servers. In this
example, the config servers use the following hosts:

- ``mongodb7.example.net``
- ``mongodb8.example.net``
- ``mongodb9.example.net``

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Configure the Config Servers

      Configure a :binary:`mongod` instance on each config server host.
      Specify these options in the :ref:`configuration file
      <configuration-options>` for each :binary:`mongod` instance:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Option
           - Value

         * - :setting:`replication.replSetName`
           - ``configReplSet``
               
         * - :setting:`sharding.clusterRole`
           - ``configsvr``

         * - :setting:`net.bindIp`
           - ``localhost``, followed by any other hostnames on
             which the :binary:`mongod` should listen for client
             connections.

      .. code-block:: yaml

         replication:
           replSetName: configReplSet
         sharding:
           clusterRole: configsvr
         net:
            bindIp: localhost,<hostname(s)>

      .. include:: /includes/sharding/convert-repl-set-tutorial/include-additional-options.rst
 
   .. step:: Start the Config Servers

      Deploy the :binary:`mongod` with your specified configuration:
      
      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --config <PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE>
         
      The config servers use the default data directory
      ``/data/configdb`` and the default port ``27019``.

   .. step:: Connect to one of the config servers.
      
      Use :binary:`mongosh` to connect to one of the config
      servers. For example:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongosh "mongodb://mongodb7.example.net:27019"
 
   .. step:: Initiate the config server replica set.

      To initiate the replica set, run :method:`rs.initiate()`:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.initiate( {
            _id: "configReplSet",
            configsvr: true,
            members: [
               { _id: 0, host: "mongodb7.example.net:27019" },
               { _id: 1, host: "mongodb8.example.net:27019" },
               { _id: 2, host: "mongodb9.example.net:27019" }
            ]
         } )

      The preceding command uses the :ref:`localhost exception
      <localhost-exception>` to perform administrative actions without
      authentication.

      .. important::

         .. include:: /includes/fact-rs-initiate-once-only.rst

3. Restore Existing Users and Roles to the New Config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Restore the existing users and roles you got when you ran ``mongodump``.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongorestore ./adminDump --nsInclude "admin.*" --host <configPrimaryURI>

The preceding command uses the :ref:`localhost exception
<localhost-exception>` to perform administrative actions without
authentication.

The output from running this command may be similar to:

.. code-block:: sh

   0 document(s) restored successfully

This message does not indicate a problem. This output means that 0 documents
other than the users and roles were restored.

4. Secure Config Server Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reconfigure and restart the config server replica set.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Reconfigure the Config Servers

      Select the tab for your authentication mechanism:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Keyfile Authentication
            :tabid: keyfile

            Restart a :binary:`mongod` instance on each of these hosts:

            - ``mongodb7.example.net``
            - ``mongodb8.example.net``
            - ``mongodb9.example.net``

            Specify these options in the :ref:`configuration file
            <configuration-options>` for each :binary:`mongod` instance:

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1

               * - Option
                 - Value

               * - :setting:`security.keyFile`
                 - The path to the key file used for your initial replica set.

            .. code-block:: yaml

               security:
                  keyFile: <PATH_TO_KEYFILE>
               replication:

               net:
                  bindIp: localhost,<hostname(s)>

            .. include:: /includes/sharding/convert-repl-set-tutorial/include-additional-options.rst

         .. tab:: x.509 Authentication
            :tabid: x509

            Restart a :binary:`mongod` instance on each of these hosts:

            - ``mongodb7.example.net``
            - ``mongodb8.example.net``
            - ``mongodb9.example.net``

            Specify these options in the :ref:`configuration file
            <configuration-options>` for each :binary:`mongod` instance
            in addition to the options you already configured:

            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1

               * - Option
                 - Value

                  bindIp: localhost,<hostname(s)>

            Include any additional options appropriate for your deployment.

   .. step:: Deploy the mongos.

      Deploy the :binary:`mongos` with your specified configuration:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongos --config <PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE>

.. _convert-deploy-sharding-infrastructure:

6. Restart the Initial Replica Set as a Shard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, your initial replica set is a three-member replica set.
This step updates the initial replica set so that it can be added as a
shard to your sharded cluster.

The replica set runs on these hosts:

- ``mongodb0.example.net:27017``
- ``mongodb1.example.net:27017``
- ``mongodb2.example.net:27017``

For sharded clusters, you must set the role for each
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance in the shard to ``shardsvr``. To specify
the server role, set the :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` setting in the
``mongod`` configuration file.

.. note::

   The default port for :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances with the
   ``shardsvr`` role is ``27018``. To use a different port, specify the
   :setting:`net.port` setting.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Connect to a member of your initial replica set.

      Use :binary:`mongosh` to connect to one of the members of your
      **initial replica set**.

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Keyfile Authentication
            :tabid: keyfile

            .. code-block:: sh

               mongosh "mongodb://<username>@mongodb0.example.net:27017"

         .. tab:: x.509 Authentication
            :tabid: x509

            .. include:: /includes/sharding/convert-repl-set-tutorial/mongosh-tls-options.rst

            For example:

            .. code-block:: sh

               mongosh "mongodb://<username>@mongodb0.example.net:27017" --tls --tlsCAFile <CA_FILE> --tlsCertificateKeyFile <filename>

   .. step:: Determine the replica set's primary and secondaries.

      Run :method:`rs.status()` to determine the primary and
      secondaries:

      .. code-block:: sh

         rs.status()

      In the command output, the
      :data:`replSetGetStatus.members[n].stateStr` field indicates which
      member is the primary and which members are secondaries.

   .. step:: Restart the secondaries with the ``--shardsvr`` option.

      .. warning::

         This step requires some downtime for applications
         connected to the replica set secondaries.

         After you restart a secondary, any applications that are
         connected to that secondary return a
         ``CannotVerifyAndSignLogicalTime`` error until you perform the
         steps in :ref:`convert-add-initial-shard`.

         You can also restart your application to stop it from receiving
         ``CannotVerifyAndSignLogicalTime`` errors.

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Keyfile Authentication
            :tabid: keyfile

            .. procedure::
               :style: connected

               .. step:: Connect to a secondary.

                  Use :binary:`mongosh` to connect to one of the
                  secondaries.

                  .. code-block:: sh

                     mongosh "mongodb://<username>@<host>:<port>"

               .. step:: Shut down the secondary.

                  Run the following commands:

                  .. code-block:: javascript

                     use admin
                     db.shutdownServer()

               .. step:: Edit the secondary's configuration file.

                  In the secondary's configuration file, set
                  :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` to ``shardsvr``:

                  .. code-block:: yaml

                     security:
                        keyFile: <PATH_TO_KEYFILE>
                     replication:
                        replSetName: rs0
                     sharding:
                        clusterRole: shardsvr
                     net:
                        port: 27017

                  .. include:: /includes/sharding/convert-repl-set-tutorial/include-additional-options.rst

               .. step:: Restart the secondary as a shard server.

                  Run the following command on the host containing the secondary:

                  .. code-block:: sh

                     mongod --config <PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE>

               .. step:: Repeat the shut down and restart steps for the other secondary.

         .. tab:: x.509 Authentication
            :tabid: x509

            .. procedure::
               :style: connected

               .. step:: Connect to a secondary.

                  Use :binary:`mongosh` to connect to one of the secondaries.

.. _convert-add-initial-shard:

7. Add the Initial Replica Set as a Shard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you convert the initial replica set (``rs0``) to a shard, add it
to the sharded cluster.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Connect to the ``mongos`` as your cluster's administrative user.

      The ``mongos`` instance is running on host
      ``mongodb6.example.net``.

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Keyfile Authentication
            :tabid: keyfile

            To connect ``mongosh`` to the ``mongos``,  run the following
            command:

            .. code-block:: sh

               mongosh "mongodb://admin01@mongodb6.example.net:27017"

         .. tab:: x.509 Authentication
            :tabid: x509

            If your deployment uses x.509 authentication, specify these
            :binary:`mongosh` options:

            .. include:: /includes/sharding/convert-repl-set-tutorial/mongosh-tls-options.rst

            .. code-block:: sh

               mongosh "mongodb://admin01@mongodb6.example.net:27017" --tls --tlsCAFile <CA_FILE> --tlsCertificateKeyFile <filename>

      This command authenticates you as the ``admin01`` user you created
      on the sharded cluster. After you enter the command, enter your
      user's password.

   .. step:: Add the shard.

      To add a shard to the cluster, run the :method:`sh.addShard`
      method:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.addShard( "rs0/mongodb0.example.net:27017,mongodb1.example.net:27017,mongodb2.example.net:27017" )

.. warning::

   Once the new shard is active, ``mongosh`` and other clients must
   **always** connect to the ``mongos`` instance. Do not connect
   directly to the ``mongod`` instances. If your clients connect to
   shards directly, you may create data or metadata inconsistencies.

.. _convert-update-app-strings:

8. Update Your Application Connection String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you add the first shard to your cluster, update the

connection string for your sharded cluster. Then, restart your
applications.

.. _convert-add-second-shard:

9. Deploy a Second Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

               * - :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile`
                 - The absolute path to the ``.pem`` file that contains
                   both the TLS certificate and key.

               * - :setting:`net.tls.CAFile`
                 - The absolute path to the ``.pem`` file that contains
                   the root certificate chain from the Certificate
                   Authority.

               * - :setting:`net.bindIp`
                 - ``localhost``, followed by any other hostnames on
                   which the :binary:`mongod` should listen for client
                   connections.

            .. code-block:: yaml

      Deploy the :binary:`mongod` with your specified configuration:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongod --config <PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE>

      .. note::

         When you specify the ``--shardsvr`` option for a
         :binary:`mongod` instance, the instance runs on port ``27018``
         by default.

   .. step:: Repeat the previous step for the other two members of the ``rs1`` replica set.

   .. step:: Connect to a replica set member.

      Use :binary:`mongosh` to connect to one of the replica set
      members. For example:

      .. tabs::
         :hidden:

         .. tab:: Keyfile Authentication
            :tabid: keyfile

            .. code-block:: sh

               mongosh "mongodb://mongodb3.example.net:27018" --tls --tlsCAFile <CA_FILE> --tlsCertificateKeyFile <filename>

   .. step:: Initiate the replica set.

      In :binary:`mongosh`, run the :method:`rs.initiate()`
      method to initiate a replica set that contains the current member:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.initiate( {
            _id : "rs1",
            members: [
                { _id: 0, host: "mongodb3.example.net:27018" },
                { _id: 1, host: "mongodb4.example.net:27018" },
                { _id: 2, host: "mongodb5.example.net:27018" }
            ]
         } )

      .. important::

         .. include:: /includes/fact-rs-initiate-once-only.rst

   .. step:: Add an administrative user for the replica set.

      After you deploy the replica set, use the :ref:`localhost exception
      <localhost-exception>` to create the replica set's first user.

      .. procedure::
         :style: connected

         .. step:: Determine the replica set primary.

            To determine the primary, run :method:`rs.status()`:

            .. code-block:: sh

               rs.status()

            In the command output, the
            :data:`replSetGetStatus.members[n].stateStr` field indicates
            which member is the primary.

         .. step:: Connect to the replica set primary.

            Connect to the replica set primary with :binary:`mongosh`.
            For example, if the primary is ``mongodb4.example.net``, run
            this command:

            .. tabs::
               :hidden:

               .. tab:: Keyfile Authentication
                  :tabid: keyfile

                  :tabid: x509

                  .. code-block:: sh

                     mongosh "mongodb://mongodb4.example.net:27018" --tls --tlsCAFile <CA_FILE> --tlsCertificateKeyFile <filename>

         .. step:: Create an administrative user.

            Run the following :method:`db.createUser()` method to create
            a user named ``rs1Admin`` with the :authrole:`userAdmin`
            role:

            .. code-block:: javascript

               use admin

               db.createUser(
                  {
                     user: "rs1Admin",
                     pwd: passwordPrompt(),
                     roles: [
                        { role: "userAdmin", db: "admin" }
                     ]
                  }
               )

            After you run the command, the database prompts you to enter a
            password for the ``rs1Admin`` user.

           :tabid: keyfile

           .. code-block:: sh

              mongosh "mongodb://admin01@mongodb6.example.net:27017/admin"

        .. tab:: x.509 Authentication
           :tabid: x509

           .. code-block:: sh
           
              mongosh "mongodb://admin01@mongodb6.example.net:27017/admin" --tls --tlsCAFile <CA_FILE> --tlsCertificateKeyFile <filename>

      This command authenticates you as the ``admin01`` user you created
      on the sharded cluster. After you enter the command, enter your
      user's password.

   .. step:: Add the second shard.

      After you connect to the :binary:`mongos`, add the replica set
      ``rs1`` as a shard to the cluster with the :method:`sh.addShard()`
      method:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.addShard( "rs1/mongodb3.example.net:27018,mongodb4.example.net:27018,mongodb5.example.net:27018" )

11. Shard a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final step of the procedure is to shard a collection in the sharded
cluster.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Determine the shard key.

      Determine the :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>` for the
      collection. The shard key indicates how MongoDB distributes the
      documents between shards. Good shard keys:

      - Have values that are evenly distributed among all documents.

      - Group documents that are often accessed at the same time into
        contiguous chunks.

      - Allow for effective distribution of activity among shards.

      For more information, see :ref:`sharding-shard-key-selection`.

      This procedure uses the ``number`` field as the shard key for
      the ``test_collection`` collection.

   .. step:: Create an index on the shard key.

      Before you shard a non-empty collection, create an index on the
      shard key:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         use test
         db.test_collection.createIndex( { "number" : 1 } )

   .. step:: Shard the collection.

      In the ``test`` database, shard the ``test_collection``.
      Specify ``number`` as the shard key.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.shardCollection( "test.test_collection", { "number" : 1 } )

      The next time that the :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` runs,
      it redistributes chunks of documents between shards. As clients
      insert additional documents into this collection, the
      :binary:`mongos` routes the documents to the appropriate
      shard.

      .. tip:: Schedule the balancing window

         When the balancer redistributes chunks, it may negatively
         impact your application's performance. To minimize performance
         impact, you can specify when the balancer runs so it does not
         run during peak hours. To learn more, see
         :ref:`sharding-schedule-balancing-window`.
