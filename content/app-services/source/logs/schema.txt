Overview
--------

Events related to your App's Atlas Schema create schema logs.
This includes both breaking (destructive) and non-breaking (additive) 
schema updates to tables and fields, as well as the collection scans used 
to automatically generate schemas based on the form of existing documents.

Fields

          running on Mozilla Firefox:

          .. code-block:: none

              SDK: firefox v10.0.0

          This request came from the Realm Java SDK version 10.0.0 running

   * - Rule Performance Metrics
     - A summary of the :ref:`roles <roles>`, :ref:`schemas
       <schemas>`, and :ref:`filters <filters>` applied to a
       return value. Provides the number of documents that a role applies to as
       well as the number of fields in those documents that App Services evaluated and
       potentially withheld.
