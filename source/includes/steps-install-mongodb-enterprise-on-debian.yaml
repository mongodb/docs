      Create the list file using the following command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.com/apt/debian wheezy/mongodb-enterprise/stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-enterprise.list

      If you'd like to install MongoDB Enterprise packages from a
      particular :ref:`release series <release-version-numbers>`, such as
      2.6, you can specify the release series in the repository
      configuration. For example, to restrict your system to the 2.6
      release series, add the following repository:
    language: sh
    code: |
      echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.com/apt/debian wheezy/mongodb-enterprise/2.6 main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-enterprise-2.6.list

      Currently packages are only available for Debian 7 (Wheezy).
