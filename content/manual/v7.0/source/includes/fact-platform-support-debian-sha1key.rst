   Starting in Debian 12, apt-based installation of MongoDB {+version+}
   |edition| from the MongoDB repository fails because the repository
   key is SHA-1, which Debian 12 rejects. To use MongoDB {+version+}
   |edition|, use the  :ref:`.tgz tarball <install-mdb-enterprise-debian-tgz>`
   install or use Debian 11 if you need an apt-based install.
