Overview
--------

You can structure your cluster with different deployment
types, cloud providers, and cluster tiers to meet the needs of a
pre-production or production environment. Use these recommendations to
select the deployment type, cloud provider and region, and {+cluster+}
and search tiers for performing vector search.

.. _fts-deployment-options-testing:

Testing and Prototyping Environments
------------------------------------

For testing your search queries and prototyping your application, we
recommend the deployment type and node architecture described in the 
following sections. 

This configuration is best suited for the following use cases:

- Less than 2M total documents to index
- Less than 10GB of indexed data
- Less than 10,000 queries in a 7-day period

If your usage exceeds the listed values, :ref:`migrate to dedicated search nodes <fts-migrate-to-decoupled>`.

The following sections describe this node architecture in more detail. 

Deployment Type
  To test |fts| queries on {+clusters+} in the cloud, you can deploy a Flex or dedicated {+cluster+}.
  
  To test |fts| queries locally, :atlascli:`create a local Atlas deployment </atlas-cli-deploy-local>`
  using the {+atlas-cli+}. This could be a single-node replica set hosted on
  your local computer. Local deployments are limited by the CPU, memory,
  and storage resources of your local machine. When your application is
  ready for production, :ref:`migrate <c2c-pull-live-migration>` your local
  |service| deployment to a production environment.

{+Cluster+} Tiers
  For testing your |fts| queries, use free (``M0``) and {+Flex-clusters+}.
  
  For prototyping your application, use dedicated ``M10``, ``M20``, and higher
  tier {+clusters+} or deploy :ref:`dedicated Search Nodes <configure-search-nodes>`
  for workload isolation. When your application is ready for production and to
  handle large datasets, upgrade to higher tiers.

Cloud Provider and Region
  Use any supported cloud provider region.
  
  The cloud provider and region that you choose affect the configuration options
  available for the {+cluster+} tiers and the :ref:`cost of running the cluster <atlas-billing>`.

Benefits

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might experience resource contention between the database ``mongod``
and the search ``mongot`` processes. This could negatively impact the
performance of your index and latency of your queries. To support
production-ready applications and their search workloads
:ref:`migrate to dedicated Search Nodes <avs-migrate-to-decoupled>`.

Cost
~~~~

There are no additional fees or charges when you enable |fts| on your
cluster. However, you might observe an increase in
resource utilization on the {+cluster+} for large indexed collections or
index definitions.

.. _mongot-unavailable:

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since both the ``mongod`` and ``mongot`` processes run on the same node,
``mongot`` might become unavailable under certain circumstances. 
The following table describes potential causes:

.. _fts-deployment-options-production:

Production Environment
----------------------

For your production-ready application, we recommend using the deployment type 
and node architecture described in the following sections. 

This configuration is best suited for the following use cases:

- If you choose to migrate your existing testing environment to production,
  add dedicated Search Nodes to your {+cluster+}. To learn more, see :ref:`fts-migrate-to-decoupled`.
- If you create a new production deployment from scratch, ensure that you use
  ``M10`` or larger tier {+clusters+} that support |fts| in the regions
  and zones where |fts| is available, and add dedicated Search Nodes to
  your environment. To learn more, see :ref:`fts-add-search-nodes-to-prod`.

Deployment Type
  For production-ready applications, use ``M10``, ``M20``, and higher
  dedicated {+cluster+} tiers. These higher tier {+clusters+} can handle
  large datasets and production workloads. 
  
  We recommend that you also :ref:`deploy dedicated Search Nodes <configure-search-nodes>`.
  If your search requirements increase, you can scale up your search deployment
  independently of scaling up the MongoDB nodes.

Cloud Provider and Region
  Use Search Nodes in all |gcp| regions and in a subset of |aws| and |azure|
  :ref:`regions <fts-cloud-provider-regions>`. You *must* select a cloud
  provider and region where Search Nodes are available for your deployment.

  All {+cluster+} tiers are available in supported cloud provider regions.
  The cloud provider and region that you choose affect the configuration
  options and search tiers available for the {+cluster+} and the
  :ref:`cost of running the cluster <atlas-billing>`.

.. _fts-search-node-benefits:

Benefits
~~~~~~~~~

Deploying separate Search Nodes provides the following benefits:

High Availability 
  When you deploy separate Search Nodes, |service| enforces a minimum of
  two Search Nodes to ensure your workload remains operational, with
  minimal downtime, in the event of a failure or disruption. 

Scalability 
  When you deploy separate Search Nodes, you can scale the storage and
  compute independently of your MongoDB {+cluster+}. This allows you to
  also scale the query load independently of MongoDB.
  
  To scale Search Nodes horizontally, increase or reduce the number of
  Search Nodes. You can provision from a minimum of 2 up to a maximum of
  32 Search Nodes. To balance the query load, |fts| distributes search
  queries across all available Search Nodes.

  To scale Search Nodes vertically, select different search tiers, CPU,
  RAM and storage configurations that support your full-text workloads.

Performance
  When you deploy dedicated Search Nodes, you improve the performance and
  resource utilization for both the ``mongod`` and ``mongot`` processes
  and eliminate resource contention between these processes.
  
  Dedicated Search Nodes support :ref:`concurrent segment search <concurrent-ref>`,
  which allows |fts| to search multiple index segments at the same time.
  Using concurrent segment search improves query response time in some cases.

Workload Isolation
  Deploying dedicated Search Nodes does not directly affect data transfer
  to the main database nodes. Search Nodes handle search queries separately
  from the main database operations, providing workload isolation while you
  incur network charges only for traffic between Search Nodes and database
  nodes.

Tips for Sizing and Scaling Search Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To determine the memory requirements for Search Nodes, use the following
|service| metrics:

- Size of the Search Index
- Total RAM on the Search Node

Consider an application that has a 10GB Search Index and 4GB total RAM on
the Search Node. In this case, if 1GB of RAM is used by other processes and
only 3GB are available for the index data, the remaining 7GB of the index
data (10GB - 3GB = 7GB) is paged in, as needed, from the disk. Frequent
paging from disk causes increased page faults, disk I/O, and CPU IOWait,
resulting in performance degradation.

If you use a higher search {+cluster+} tier with more RAM, such as 8GB or more,
this allows |service| to serve most of the data for the Search Index from memory,
minimizing disk reads and page faults, thereby improving performance.

.. note::

   The local |ssd|\s used for Search Nodes require a 20% 
   storage overhead to support index operations.

Add Dedicated Search Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding dedicated Search Nodes to a new {+cluster+} allows you to:

- Change the size and scale of your search deployment independently from
  your {+database-deployment+}.
- Eliminate resource contention that you might experience on a {+cluster+}
  that runs both the MongoDB database and search processes on the same node.

To add dedicated Search Nodes:

1. Create your {+cluster+} as an ``M10`` or higher tier in a cloud provider
   and region that supports node isolation. To learn more, see :ref:`create-new-cluster`.

   Dedicated Search Nodes are supported only for ``M10`` and higher {+cluster+} tiers
   and in :ref:`cloud provider regions that support node isolation <fts-cloud-provider-regions>`.

2. Enable :guilabel:`Search Nodes for workload isolation` and :ref:`Configure Search Nodes <add-search-nodes>`.

.. _fts-migrate-to-decoupled:

Migrate to Dedicated Search Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To migrate from staging to production and add dedicated Search Nodes, make
the following changes to your existing staging and prototyping deployment:

1. If your deployment uses a Flex {+cluster+},
   :ref:`change the cluster tier to a higher tier <scale-cluster-instance>`.
   Dedicated Search Nodes are supported only for ``M10`` and higher {+cluster+} tiers.

2. Deploy your {+cluster+} in regions where Search Nodes are also available.
   Dedicated Search Nodes are available on a subset of the |aws| and |azure|
   regions and in all supported |gcp| regions. If your existing {+cluster+}
   is hosted in regions where Search Nodes aren't available, migrate your
   {+cluster+} to regions where Search Nodes are available. To learn more,
   see :ref:`Cloud Provider Regions that Support Node Isolation <fts-cloud-provider-regions>`.

3. Enable :guilabel:`Search Nodes for workload isolation` and configure
   Search Nodes. To learn more, see :ref:`add-search-nodes`.

   When you deploy dedicated Search Nodes, the following sequence of actions
   takes place:

   - |service| builds the search indexes on the Search Nodes and removes
     the indexes from the {+cluster+} nodes.
   - |service| routes search queries to the Search Nodes.
   - |fts| uses the search indexes to serve queries on your cluster.

Troubleshoot Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Failed to Execute search Command`` Error
``````````````````````````````````````````

If you deploy ``mongot`` to run alongside ``mongod`` and **don't configure**
Search Nodes, ``mongot`` might terminate and return the ``Failed to Execute search Command``
error during any of the following events:

- Scaling up a {+cluster+}
- Node failover
- Upgrading ``mongot``

If you deploy ``mongot`` on dedicated Search Nodes, ``mongod`` uses a proxy
that routes search queries only to the healthy nodes where the ``mongot``
process is active.
