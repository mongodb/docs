   Click the :guilabel:`Details` button to expose the lower half of the form.

   The following form fields are required:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 30 70

      * - Field Name
        - Description

      * - :guilabel:`Data Source Name`
        - A name of your choice.

      * - :guilabel:`TCP/IP Server`
        - Address of the server where your
          :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` process is running. If you have enabled
          |bi-short| on `MongoDB Atlas
          <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`_, you can find the
          hostname of the server where :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` is running
          in the `connection information
          <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/connect-to-cluster/#connect-to-your-cluster>`_
          for your cluster.

      * - :guilabel:`Port`
        - Port number of your :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`
          process.

      * - :guilabel:`User`
        - Required when running with :option:`--auth <mongosqld --auth>`
          enabled and when
          connecting to an Atlas BI Connector instance.
          Username of the :manual:`MongoDB user
          </core/security-users/>` who is authenticated to use your
          target database. Append the name of the authentication database
          to the username in the format:

          .. code-block:: shell

             <username>?source=<database-name>

          For example, if user ``dbUser`` is authenticated in
          the ``admin`` database, the :guilabel:`User` field should
          contain the string ``dbUser?source=admin``.

      * - :guilabel:`Password`
        - Required when running with :option:`--auth
          <mongosqld --auth>` enabled.
          The authenticated user's password.

      * - :guilabel:`Database`
        - The name of the database to connect to, e.g. ``test``.

      * - :guilabel:`Authentication`
        - Required when running with :option:`--auth
          <mongosqld --auth>` enabled.
          The default authentication method.
          To use the :doc:`authentication plugin
          </tutorial/install-auth-plugin-c>`, fill in this field with the
          string ``mongosql_auth``.

          .. note::

             The :guilabel:`Authentication` field is at the bottom
             of the form. Be careful not to miss it.

   The following example configuration assumes the following:

   - A :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` instance running on ``localhost`` port
     ``3307`` with authentication enabled.
   - A :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/>` instance running with
     :manual:`authentication </reference/program/mongod#cmdoption-auth>` enabled.
   - A :manual:`MongoDB user </core/security-users/>` named
     ``dbUser`` who is authenticated to use the ``test``
     database.

   The values you enter may be different.

   If the connection is successful, click :guilabel:`OK` to add the
   :abbr:`DSN (Data Source Name)`. If the connection fails,
   check to make sure your MongoDB user is correctly authenticated for
   the database named in the connection, and that the authentication
   plugin is installed.
