.. tip:: Explicit Resource Management 

    The {+driver-short+} natively supports explicit resource management for
    ``MongoClient``, ``ClientSession``, ``ChangeStreams``, and cursors. This
    feature is experimental and subject to change. To learn how to use explicit
    resource management, see the `v6.9 Release Notes.
