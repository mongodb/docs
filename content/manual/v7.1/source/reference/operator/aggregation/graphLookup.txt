.. pipeline:: $graphLookup

   .. versionchanged:: 5.1

   Performs a recursive search on a collection, with options for
   restricting the search by recursion depth and query filter.

   The ``$graphLookup`` search process is summarized below:

   1. Input documents flow into the ``$graphLookup`` stage of an
      aggregation operation.


   2. ``$graphLookup`` targets the search to the collection
      designated by the ``from`` parameter (see below for full
      list of search parameters).

   3. For each input document, the search begins with the value
      designated by ``startWith``.

   4. ``$graphLookup`` matches the ``startWith`` value
      against the field designated by ``connectToField`` in other
      documents in the ``from`` collection.

   5. For each matching document, ``$graphLookup`` takes the value of
      the ``connectFromField`` and checks every document in the
      ``from`` collection for a matching ``connectToField`` value. For
      each match, ``$graphLookup`` adds the matching document in the
      ``from`` collection to an array field named by the ``as``
      parameter.

      This step continues recursively until no more matching documents
      are found, or until the operation reaches a recursion depth
      specified by the ``maxDepth`` parameter. ``$graphLookup`` then
      appends the array field to the input document. ``$graphLookup``
      returns results after completing its search on all input
      documents.

   :pipeline:`$graphLookup` has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         $graphLookup: {
            from: <collection>,
            startWith: <expression>,
            connectFromField: <string>,
            connectToField: <string>,
            as: <string>,
            maxDepth: <number>,
            depthField: <string>,
            restrictSearchWithMatch: <document>
         }
      }

   :pipeline:`$graphLookup` takes a document with the following fields:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 40 60

      * - Field
        - Description

      * - ``from``

        - Target collection for the :pipeline:`$graphLookup`
          operation to search, recursively matching the
          ``connectFromField`` to the ``connectToField``.
          The ``from`` collection must be in the same
          database as any other collections used in the operation.

          Starting in MongoDB 5.1, the collection specified in the 
          ``from`` parameter can be sharded.

      * - ``startWith``

        - :ref:`Expression <aggregation-expressions>` that specifies
          the value of the ``connectFromField`` with which to start the
          recursive search. Optionally, ``startWith`` may be array of
          values, each of which is individually followed through the
          traversal process.

      * - ``connectFromField``

        - Field name whose value :pipeline:`$graphLookup` uses to
          recursively match against the ``connectToField`` of other
          documents in the collection. If the value is an array, each
          element is individually followed through the
          traversal process.

      * - ``connectToField``

        - Field name in other documents against which to match the
          value of the field specified by the ``connectFromField``
          parameter.

      * - ``as``

        - Name of the array field added to each output document.
          Contains the documents traversed in the
          :pipeline:`$graphLookup` stage to reach the document.

          .. note::

             Documents returned in the ``as`` field are not guaranteed
             to be in any order.

      * - ``maxDepth``
        - *Optional.* Non-negative integral number specifying the
          maximum recursion depth.

      * - ``depthField`` 

        - *Optional.* Name of the field to add to each traversed
          document in the search path. The value of this field
          is the recursion depth for the document, represented as a
          :bsontype:`NumberLong<data_numberlong>`. Recursion depth
          value starts at zero, so the first lookup corresponds to
          zero depth.

      * - ``restrictSearchWithMatch``

        - *Optional.* A document specifying additional conditions
          for the recursive search. The syntax is identical to
          :ref:`query filter <read-operations-query-argument>` syntax.

          .. note::

             You cannot use any :ref:`aggregation expression
             <aggregation-expressions>` in this filter. For example, a
             query document such as

             .. code-block:: javascript

                { lastName: { $ne: "$lastName" } }

             will not work in this context to find documents in which
             the ``lastName`` value is different from the ``lastName``
             value of the input document, because ``"$lastName"`` will
             act as a string literal, not a field path.

Considerations
--------------

.. _graphLookup-sharded-collections:

Sharded Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, you can specify :ref:`sharded collections 
<sharding-sharded-cluster>` in the ``from`` parameter of 
:pipeline:`$graphLookup` stages.

.. include:: /includes/graphLookup-sharded-coll-transaction-note.rst

Max Depth
~~~~~~~~~

Setting the ``maxDepth`` field to ``0`` is equivalent to a
non-recursive :pipeline:`$graphLookup` search stage.

Memory
~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-graphlookup-memory-restrictions.rst

See :doc:`aggregration pipeline limitations
</core/aggregation-pipeline-limits>` for more information.

Views and Collation

Examples
--------

Within a Single Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection named ``employees`` has the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Dev" }
   { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Eliot", "reportsTo" : "Dev" }
   { "_id" : 3, "name" : "Ron", "reportsTo" : "Eliot" }
   { "_id" : 4, "name" : "Andrew", "reportsTo" : "Eliot" }
   { "_id" : 5, "name" : "Asya", "reportsTo" : "Ron" }
   { "_id" : 6, "name" : "Dan", "reportsTo" : "Andrew" }

The following :pipeline:`$graphLookup` operation recursively matches
on the ``reportsTo`` and ``name`` fields in the ``employees``
collection, returning the reporting hierarchy for each person:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.employees.aggregate( [
      {
         $graphLookup: {
            from: "employees",
            startWith: "$reportsTo",
            connectFromField: "reportsTo",
            connectToField: "name",
            as: "reportingHierarchy"
         }
      }
   ] )

The operation returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : 1,
      "name" : "Dev",
      "reportingHierarchy" : [ ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 2,
      "name" : "Eliot",
      "reportsTo" : "Dev",
      "reportingHierarchy" : [
         { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Dev" }
      ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 3,
      "name" : "Ron",
      "reportsTo" : "Eliot",
      "reportingHierarchy" : [
         { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Dev" },
         { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Eliot", "reportsTo" : "Dev" }
      ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 4,
      "name" : "Andrew",
      "reportsTo" : "Eliot",
      "reportingHierarchy" : [
         { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Dev" },
         { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Eliot", "reportsTo" : "Dev" }
      ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 5,
      "name" : "Asya",
      "reportsTo" : "Ron",
      "reportingHierarchy" : [
         { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Dev" },
         { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Eliot", "reportsTo" : "Dev" },
         { "_id" : 3, "name" : "Ron", "reportsTo" : "Eliot" }
      ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 6,
      "name" : "Dan",
      "reportsTo" : "Andrew",
      "reportingHierarchy" : [
         { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Dev" },
         { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Eliot", "reportsTo" : "Dev" },
         { "_id" : 4, "name" : "Andrew", "reportsTo" : "Eliot" }
      ]
   }

The following table provides a traversal path for the
document ``{ "_id" : 5, "name" : "Asya", "reportsTo" : "Ron" }``:

.. list-table::
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Start value

     - The ``reportsTo`` value of the document:

       .. code-block:: javascript

          { ... "reportsTo" : "Ron" }

   * - Depth 0

     - .. code-block:: javascript

          { "_id" : 3, "name" : "Ron", "reportsTo" : "Eliot" }

   * - Depth 1

     - .. code-block:: javascript

          { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Eliot", "reportsTo" : "Dev" }

   * - Depth 2

     - .. code-block:: javascript

          { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Dev" }

The output generates the hierarchy
``Asya -> Ron -> Eliot -> Dev``.

Across Multiple Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like :pipeline:`$lookup`, :pipeline:`$graphLookup` can access
another collection in the same database.

For example, create a database with two collections: 

- An ``airports`` collection with the following documents:

  .. code-block:: javascript

   db.airports.insertMany( [
      { "_id" : 0, "airport" : "JFK", "connects" : [ "BOS", "ORD" ] },
      { "_id" : 1, "airport" : "BOS", "connects" : [ "JFK", "PWM" ] },
      { "_id" : 2, "airport" : "ORD", "connects" : [ "JFK" ] },
      { "_id" : 3, "airport" : "PWM", "connects" : [ "BOS", "LHR" ] },
      { "_id" : 4, "airport" : "LHR", "connects" : [ "PWM" ] }
   ] )

- A ``travelers`` collection with the following documents:

  .. code-block:: javascript

   db.travelers.insertMany( [
      { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Dev", "nearestAirport" : "JFK" },
      { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Eliot", "nearestAirport" : "JFK" },
      { "_id" : 3, "name" : "Jeff", "nearestAirport" : "BOS" }
   ] )


For each document in the ``travelers`` collection, the following
aggregation operation looks up the ``nearestAirport`` value in the
``airports`` collection and recursively matches the ``connects``
field to the ``airport`` field. The operation specifies a maximum
recursion depth of ``2``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.travelers.aggregate( [
      {
         $graphLookup: {
            from: "airports",
            startWith: "$nearestAirport",
            connectFromField: "connects",
            connectToField: "airport",
            maxDepth: 2,
            depthField: "numConnections",
            as: "destinations"
         }
      }
   ] )

The operation returns the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : 1,
      "name" : "Dev",
      "nearestAirport" : "JFK",
      "destinations" : [
         { "_id" : 3,
           "airport" : "PWM",
           "connects" : [ "BOS", "LHR" ],
           "numConnections" : NumberLong(2) },
         { "_id" : 2,
           "airport" : "ORD",
           "connects" : [ "JFK" ],
           "numConnections" : NumberLong(1) },
         { "_id" : 1,
           "airport" : "BOS",
           "connects" : [ "JFK", "PWM" ],
           "numConnections" : NumberLong(1) },
         { "_id" : 0,
           "airport" : "JFK",
           "connects" : [ "BOS", "ORD" ],
           "numConnections" : NumberLong(0) }
      ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 2,
      "name" : "Eliot",
      "nearestAirport" : "JFK",
      "destinations" : [
         { "_id" : 3,
           "airport" : "PWM",
           "connects" : [ "BOS", "LHR" ],
           "numConnections" : NumberLong(2) },
         { "_id" : 2,
           "airport" : "ORD",
           "connects" : [ "JFK" ],
           "numConnections" : NumberLong(1) },
         { "_id" : 1,
           "airport" : "BOS",
           "connects" : [ "JFK", "PWM" ],
           "numConnections" : NumberLong(1) },
         { "_id" : 0,
           "airport" : "JFK",
           "connects" : [ "BOS", "ORD" ],
           "numConnections" : NumberLong(0) } ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 3,
      "name" : "Jeff",
      "nearestAirport" : "BOS",
      "destinations" : [
         { "_id" : 2,
           "airport" : "ORD",
           "connects" : [ "JFK" ],
           "numConnections" : NumberLong(2) },
         { "_id" : 3,
           "airport" : "PWM",
           "connects" : [ "BOS", "LHR" ],
           "numConnections" : NumberLong(1) },
         { "_id" : 4,
           "airport" : "LHR",
           "connects" : [ "PWM" ],
           "numConnections" : NumberLong(2) },
         { "_id" : 0,
           "airport" : "JFK",
           "connects" : [ "BOS", "ORD" ],
           "numConnections" : NumberLong(1) },
         { "_id" : 1,
           "airport" : "BOS",
           "connects" : [ "JFK", "PWM" ],
           "numConnections" : NumberLong(0) }
      ]
   }

The following table provides a traversal path for the recursive
search, up to depth ``2``, where the starting ``airport`` is ``JFK``:

.. list-table::
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Start value

     - The ``nearestAirport`` value from the ``travelers`` collection:

       .. code-block:: javascript

          { ... "nearestAirport" : "JFK" }

   * - Depth 0

     - .. code-block:: javascript

          { "_id" : 0, "airport" : "JFK", "connects" : [ "BOS", "ORD" ] }

   * - Depth 1

     - .. code-block:: javascript

          { "_id" : 1, "airport" : "BOS", "connects" : [ "JFK", "PWM" ] }
          { "_id" : 2, "airport" : "ORD", "connects" : [ "JFK" ] }

   * - Depth 2

     - .. code-block:: javascript

          { "_id" : 3, "airport" : "PWM", "connects" : [ "BOS", "LHR" ] }

With a Query Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses a collection with a set
of documents containing names of people along with arrays of their
friends and their hobbies. An aggregation operation finds one
particular person and traverses her network of connections to find
people who list ``golf`` among their hobbies.

A collection named ``people`` contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : 1,
     "name" : "Tanya Jordan",
     "friends" : [ "Shirley Soto", "Terry Hawkins", "Carole Hale" ],
     "hobbies" : [ "tennis", "unicycling", "golf" ]
   }
   {
     "_id" : 2,
     "name" : "Carole Hale",
     "friends" : [ "Joseph Dennis", "Tanya Jordan", "Terry Hawkins" ],
     "hobbies" : [ "archery", "golf", "woodworking" ]
   }
   {
     "_id" : 3,
     "name" : "Terry Hawkins",
     "friends" : [ "Tanya Jordan", "Carole Hale", "Angelo Ward" ],
     "hobbies" : [ "knitting", "frisbee" ]
   }
   {
     "_id" : 4,
     "name" : "Joseph Dennis",
     "friends" : [ "Angelo Ward", "Carole Hale" ],
     "hobbies" : [ "tennis", "golf", "topiary" ]
   }
   {
     "_id" : 5,
     "name" : "Angelo Ward",
     "friends" : [ "Terry Hawkins", "Shirley Soto", "Joseph Dennis" ],
     "hobbies" : [ "travel", "ceramics", "golf" ]
   }
   {
      "_id" : 6,
      "name" : "Shirley Soto",
      "friends" : [ "Angelo Ward", "Tanya Jordan", "Carole Hale" ],
      "hobbies" : [ "frisbee", "set theory" ]
    }

The following aggregation operation uses three stages:

- :pipeline:`$match` matches on documents with a ``name`` field
  containing the string ``"Tanya Jordan"``. Returns one output
  document.

- :pipeline:`$graphLookup` connects the output document's ``friends``
  field with the ``name`` field of other documents in the
  collection to traverse ``Tanya Jordan's`` network of connections.
  This stage uses the ``restrictSearchWithMatch`` parameter to find
  only documents in which the ``hobbies`` array contains ``golf``.
  Returns one output document.

- :pipeline:`$project` shapes the output document. The names listed in
  ``connections who play golf`` are taken from the ``name`` field of the
  documents listed in the input document's ``golfers`` array.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.aggregate( [
     { $match: { "name": "Tanya Jordan" } },
     { $graphLookup: {
         from: "people",
         startWith: "$friends",
         connectFromField: "friends",
         connectToField: "name",
         as: "golfers",
         restrictSearchWithMatch: { "hobbies" : "golf" }
       }
     },
     { $project: {
         "name": 1,
         "friends": 1,
         "connections who play golf": "$golfers.name"
       }
     }
   ] )

The operation returns the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : 1,
      "name" : "Tanya Jordan",
      "friends" : [
         "Shirley Soto",
         "Terry Hawkins",
         "Carole Hale"
      ],
      "connections who play golf" : [
         "Joseph Dennis",
         "Tanya Jordan",
         "Angelo Ward",
         "Carole Hale"
      ]
   }
