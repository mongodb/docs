MongoDB 3.2 introduces the ``readConcern`` query option for replica
sets and replica set shards. For the :doc:`WiredTiger storage engine
</core/wiredtiger>`, the ``readConcern`` option allows clients to
choose a level of isolation for their reads. You can specify a
``readConcern`` of ``"majority"`` to read data that has been written to
a majority of nodes and thus cannot be rolled back. By default, MongoDB
uses a ``readConcern`` of ``"local"`` to return the most recent data
available to the node at the time of the query, even if the data has
not been persisted to a majority of nodes and may be rolled back. With
the :doc:`MMAPv1 storage engine </core/mmapv1>`, you can only specify a
``readConcern`` of ``"local"``.

``readConcern`` requires MongoDB drivers updated for 3.2.

``readConcern`` Levels
----------------------

By default, MongoDB uses a ``readConcern`` of ``"local"`` which
does not guarantee that the read data would not be rolled back.

You can specify a ``readConcern`` of ``"majority"`` to
read data that has been written to a majority of nodes and thus cannot
be rolled back.

   * - ``level``
     - Description

   * - .. readconcern:: "local"

     - Default. The query will return the node's most recent copy of
       data. Provides no guarantee that the data has been written to a
       majority of the nodes.

   * - .. readconcern:: "majority"

     - The query will return the node's most recent copy of the data
       confirmed as having been written to a majority of the nodes.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-enable-majority-readConcern.rst

.. note::
   The most recent data on a node, regardless of the level, may not
   reflect the most recent version of the data in the system.

``readConcern`` Option
----------------------

Use the ``readConcern`` option to specify the readConcern level.

.. code-block:: javascript

   readConcern: { level: <"majority"|"local"> }

For the ``level`` field, specify either the string ``"majority"`` or
``"local"``.

The ``readConcern`` option is available for the following operations:

- :dbcommand:`find` command

- :dbcommand:`aggregate` command and the
  :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method

- :dbcommand:`distinct` command

- :dbcommand:`count` command

- :dbcommand:`parallelCollectionScan` command

- :dbcommand:`geoNear` command

- :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command
