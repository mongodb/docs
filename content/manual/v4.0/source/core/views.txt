A MongoDB view is a queryable object whose contents are defined by an
:ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` on other collections
or views. MongoDB does not persist the view contents to disk. A view's
content is computed on-demand when a client :ref:`queries
<views-supported-operations>` the view. MongoDB can require clients to
:ref:`have permission <authorization>` to query the view. MongoDB does
not support write operations against views.

For example, you can:

- Create a view on a collection of employee data to 
  :pipeline:`exclude <$project>` any private or personal
  information (PII). Applications can query the view for employee
  data that does not contain any PII.

- Create a view on a collection of collected sensor data to 
  :pipeline:`add <$addFields>` computed fields and metrics. Applications
  can use simple find operations to query the data.

- Create a view that :pipeline:`joins <$lookup>` two collections
  containing inventory and order history respectively. Applications can
  query the joined data without managing or understanding the underlying
  complex pipeline.

When clients :ref:`query a view <views-supported-operations>`, MongoDB
appends the client query to the underlying pipeline and returns the
results of that combined pipeline to the client. MongoDB may apply
:doc:`aggregation pipeline optimizations
</core/aggregation-pipeline-optimization>` to the combined pipeline.

Create View
-----------

To create or define a view:

- Use the :method:`db.createCollection()` method or the 
  :dbcommand:`create` command:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.createCollection( 
       "<viewName>", 
       {
         "viewOn" : "<source>", 
         "pipeline" : [<pipeline>],
         "collation" : { <collation> }
       }
     )

- Use the :method:`db.createView()` method:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.createView(
       "<viewName>",
       "<source>",
       [<pipeline>],
       {
         "collation" : { <collation> }
       }
     )

.. note::
   You must create views in the same database as the source collection.

Behavior
--------

Public View Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operations that lists collections, such as
:method:`db.getCollectionInfos()` and
:method:`db.getCollectionNames()`, include views in their outputs.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-public-definition.rst

Drop a View
-----------

To remove a view, use the :method:`db.collection.drop()` method on the
view.

Modify a View
-------------

You can modify a view either by dropping and recreating the view or
using the :dbcommand:`collMod` command.
