Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official MongoDB PHP driver.
You can add the driver to your application to work with MongoDB in PHP.
The MongoDB PHP Driver consists of the following components:

- The `extension <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver>`__, which
  provides a low-level API and mainly serves to integrate
  `libmongoc and libbson <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/c/c-driver/current/>`__ with
  PHP.

- The `library <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current>`__, which
  provides a high-level API for working with MongoDB
  databases consistent with other MongoDB language drivers.

While it is possible to use the extension alone, MongoDB recommends
using both the extension and the library together. To learn more about
the components of the PHP driver, see the :ref:`Driver Architecture
<php-driver-arch>` section of this page.

Driver Architecture
-------------------

This section describes how the components of the PHP driver work together.
These components fit into the following general categories:

- High-Level API, which includes the library and other integrations 
- Extension, which includes the extension that integrates the system libraries
- System, which includes the C Driver, BSON library, and encryption library

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the PHP driver
components:

.. figure:: /figures/PHP_driver_architecture.svg
   :alt: PHP driver component architecture
   :figwidth: 600px
   
The PHP library provides an API that is consistent with the other
MongoDB drivers. The library is continually updated to meet cross-driver
specifications. You must add the library as a dependency to access
MongoDB in most PHP applications.

The extension is distributed by using `PECL
<https://www.php.net/manual/en/mongodb.installation.pecl.php>`__, and
connects PHP to the system libraries. The extension's public API
provides the following functionality:

- Connection management
- BSON encoding and decoding
- Object document serialization
- Command execution
- Cursor management

To learn more about the system libraries, see the `C Driver
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/c/c-driver/current/>`__ documentation.

Connect to a Compatible MongoDB Deployment
------------------------------------------

You can use the PHP driver to connect to deployments hosted in the
following environments:

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments.rst

Installation
------------

First, make sure you have a recent version of PHP installed on your
system. See the
`official PHP manual <https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php>`__
for download and installation instructions.

Install the PHP MongoDB Extension before installing the PHP Library for
MongoDB. You can install the extension using
`PECL <https://www.php.net/manual/en/mongodb.installation.pecl.php>`__ on
the command line:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo pecl install mongodb

Finally, add the following line to your ``php.ini`` file:

.. code-block:: text

   extension=mongodb.so

.. note::

   On some systems, there may be multiple INI files for individual SAPIs (e.g.
   CLI, FPM). Make sure to enable the extension in all SAPIs that you need.

The preferred method of installing the PHP library is with
`Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`__ by running the following from your project root:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ composer require mongodb/mongodb

Once you have installed the library, ensure that your application includes
Composer's autoloader as in the following example:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php

   require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

Additional installation instructions may be found in the
`library documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/php-library/current/tutorial/install-php-library/>`__.

.. _connect-atlas-php-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas
------------------------

You can use the following connection snippet to test your connection to
your MongoDB deployment on Atlas:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/php-connection.php
   :language: php

This connection snippet uses the {+stable-api+} feature, which you can
enable when using the PHP driver v1.9 and later to connect to MongoDB Server
v5.0 and later. When you use this feature, you can update your driver or server without 
worrying about backward compatibility issues with any commands covered by the
{+stable-api+}.

To learn more about the {+stable-api+} feature, see
:manual:`{+stable-api+} </reference/stable-api/>` in the Server manual.

.. include:: /includes/stable-api-notice.rst

.. _connect-atlas-no-stable-api-php-driver:

Connect to MongoDB Atlas Without the Stable API
-----------------------------------------------

If you are using a version of MongoDB or the driver that doesn't support the
{+stable-api+} feature, you can use the following code snippet to test your connection
to your MongoDB deployment on Atlas:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connection-snippets/scram/php-connection-no-stableapi.php
   :language: php

Connect to a MongoDB Server on Your Local Machine
-------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/localhost-connection.rst

To test whether you can connect to your server, replace the connection
string in the :ref:`Connect to MongoDB Atlas <connect-atlas-php-driver>` code
example and run it.

Compatibility
-------------

Due to potential problems representing 64-bit integers on 32-bit platforms,
users are advised to use 64-bit environments. When using a 32-bit platform, be
aware that any 64-bit integer read from the database will be returned as a
`MongoDB\\BSON\\Int64 <https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.mongodb-bson-int64.php>`__
instance instead of a PHP integer type.

MongoDB Compatibility

The following compatibility table specifies the recommended version or versions
of the PHP driver for use with a specific version of MongoDB.

The first column lists the driver version.
