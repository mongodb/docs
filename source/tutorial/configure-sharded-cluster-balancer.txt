Configure Behavior of Balancer Process in Sharded Clusters
==========================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The balancer is a process that runs on *one* of the :program:`mongos`
instances in a cluster and ensures that :term:`chunks <chunk>` are
evenly distributed throughout a sharded cluster. In most deployments,
the default balancer configuration is sufficient for normal
operation. However, administrators might need to modify balancer
behavior depending on application or operational requirements. If you
encounter a situation where you need to modify the behavior of the
balancer, use the procedures described in this document.

For conceptual information about the balancer, see
:ref:`sharding-balancing` and :ref:`sharding-balancing-internals`.

.. _sharded-cluster-config-balancing-window:

Schedule a Window of Time for Balancing to Occur
------------------------------------------------

You can schedule a window of time during which the balancer can
migrate chunks, as described in the following procedures:

- :ref:`sharding-schedule-balancing-window`

- :ref:`sharding-balancing-remove-window`.

The :program:`mongos` instances user their own local timezones to when
respecting balancer window.

.. _sharded-cluster-config-default-chunk-size:

Configure Default Chunk Size
----------------------------

The default chunk size for a sharded cluster is 64 megabytes. In most
situations, the default size is appropriate for splitting and migrating
chunks. For information on how chunk size affects deployments, see
details, see :ref:`sharding-chunk-size`.

Changing the default chunk size affects chunks that are processes during
migrations and auto-splits but does not retroactively affect all chunks.

To configure default chunk size, see :doc:`modify-chunk-size-in-sharded-cluster`.

.. _sharded-cluster-config-max-shard-size:

Change the Maximum Storage Size for a Given Shard
-------------------------------------------------

The ``maxSize`` field in the :data:`~config.shards` collection in the
:ref:`config database <config-database>` sets the maximum size for a
shard, allowing you to control whether the balancer will migrate chunks
to a shard. If :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped` size [#local-limitation]_ is above a shard's
``maxSize``, the balancer will not move chunks to the shard. Also, the
balancer will not move chunks off an overloaded shard. This must happen
manually. The ``maxSize`` value only affects the balancer's selection of
destination shards.

By default, ``maxSize`` is not specified, allowing shards to consume the
total amount of available space on their machines if necessary.

You can set ``maxSize`` both when adding a shard and once a shard is
running.

To set ``maxSize`` when adding a shard, set the :dbcommand:`addShard`
command's ``maxSize`` parameter to the maximum size in megabytes. For
example, the following command run in the :program:`mongo` shell adds a
shard with a maximum size of 125 megabytes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { addshard : "example.net:34008", maxSize : 125 } )

To set ``maxSize`` on an existing shard, insert or update the
``maxSize`` field in the :data:`~config.shards` collection in the
:ref:`config database <config-database>`. Set the ``maxSize`` in
megabytes.

.. example::

   Assume you have the following shard without a ``maxSize`` field:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id" : "shard0000", "host" : "example.net:34001" }

   Run the following sequence of commands in the :program:`mongo` shell
   to insert a ``maxSize`` of 125 megabytes:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config
      db.shards.update( { _id : "shard0000" }, { $set : { maxSize : 125 } } )

   To later increase the ``maxSize`` setting to 250 megabytes, run the
   following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config
      db.shards.update( { _id : "shard0000" }, { $set : { maxSize : 250 } } )

.. [#local-limitation] This value includes the mapped size of all data
   files including the``local`` and ``admin`` databases. Account for
   this when setting ``maxSize``.

.. index:: balancing; secondary throttle
.. index:: secondary throttle
.. _sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle:

Require Replication before Chunk Migration (Secondary Throttle)
---------------------------------------------------------------

``_secondaryThrottle`` affects the write concern of
the balancer and the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command. See
:ref:`chunk-migration-write-concern` for a detailed explanation of
write concern with and without ``_secondaryThrottle`` set to ``true``.

Run the following operations from a :program:`mongo` shell that
is connected to a :program:`mongos` instance to enable or disable
``_secondaryThrottle`` directly in the :data:`~config.settings`
collection of the :ref:`config database <config-database>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use config
   db.settings.update( { "_id" : "balancer" } , { $set : { "_secondaryThrottle" : true } } , { upsert : true } )
