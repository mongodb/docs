Restore a Replica Set from MongoDB Backups
==========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This procedure outlines the process for taking MongoDB data and
restoring that data into a new :term:`replica set`. Use this approach
for seeding test deployments from production backups as well as part
of disaster recovery.

You *cannot* restore a single data set to three new
:program:`mongod` instances and *then* create a replica set. In this
situation MongoDB will force the secondaries to perform an initial
sync. The procedures in this document describe the correct and
efficient ways to deploy a replica set.

Restore Database into a Single Node Replica Set
-----------------------------------------------

#. Obtain backup MongoDB Database files. These files may come from a
   :doc:`file system snapshot
   </tutorial/backup-and-restore-with-filesystem-snapshots>`.  The
   `MongoDB Management Service (MMS)
   <https://mms.mongodb.com/?pk_campaign=mongodb-docs-restore-rs-tutorial>`_
   produces MongoDB database files for :mms:`stored snapshots
   </backup/tutorial/restore-snapshot>` and :mms:`point and time
   snapshots </backup/tutorial/restore-from-point-in-time-snapshot>`.

   You can also use :program:`mongorestore` to restore database files
   using data created with :program:`mongodump`. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/backup-and-restore-with-binary-database-dumps` for
   more information.

#. Start a :program:`mongod` using data files from the backup as the
   ``dbpath``. In the following example, ``/data/db`` is the ``dbpath`` to
   the data files:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /data/db

#. Convert your standalone :program:`mongod` process to a single node
   replica set by shutting down the :program:`mongod` instance, and
   restarting it with the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`
   option, as in the following example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --dbpath /data/db --replSet <replName>

   .. optional::

      Consider explicitly setting a :setting:`oplogSize` to control
      the size of the :term:`oplog` created for this replica set
      member.

#. Connect to the :program:`mongod` instance.

#. Use :method:`rs.initiate()` to initiate the new replica set.

Add Members to the Replica Set
------------------------------

MongoDB provides two options for restoring secondary members of a
replica set:

1. Manually copy the database files to each data directory.

2. Allow :ref:`initial sync <replica-set-initial-sync>` to distribute
   data automatically.

The following sections outlines both approaches.

.. note::

   If your database is large, initial sync can take a long time to
   complete. For large databases, it might be preferable to copy the
   database files onto each host.

Copy Database Files and Restart :program:`mongod` Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following sequence of operations to "seed" additional members
of the replica set with the restored data by copying MongoDB data
files directly.

#. Shut down the :program:`mongod` instance that you restored.
   Using :option:`--shutdown <mongod --shutdown>` or
   :method:`db.shutdownServer()` to ensure a clean shut down.

#. Copy the :term:`primary's <primary>` data directory into the
   :setting:`dbpath` of the other members of the replica set. The
   :setting:`dbpath` is ``/data/db`` by default.

#. Start the :program:`mongod` instance that you restored.

#. In a :program:`mongo` shell connected to the :term:`primary`, add
   the :term:`secondaries <secondary>` to the replica set using
   :method:`rs.add()`. See :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set` for
   more information about deploying a replica set.

Update Secondaries using Initial Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following sequence of operations to "seed" additional members
of the replica set with the restored data using the default *initial
sync* operation.

#. Ensure that the data directories on the prospective replica set
   members are empty.

#. Add each prospective member to the replica set. :ref:`Initial Sync
   <replica-set-initial-sync>` will copy the data from the
   :term:`primary` to the other members of the replica set.
