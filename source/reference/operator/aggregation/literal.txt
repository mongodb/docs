$literal (aggregation)
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. expression:: $literal

   Wraps an expression to prevent the aggregation pipeline from
   interpreting an object directly.

   For example, use :expression:`$literal` with :pipeline:`$project`
   statements to project fields with dollar signs (e.g.``$``) in
   their values.

Example
-------

Consider the following example to use the aggregation framework to
interact with a string that contains a dollar sign:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { aggregate: "records",
                    pipeline: [  { $project: { costsOneDollar:
                                      { $eq: [ "$price", { $literal: "$1.00" } ] } }
                                 } ] } )

This operation projects documents with a field named ``costsOneDollar``
that holds a boolean value if the value of the field is the string
``$1.00``.
