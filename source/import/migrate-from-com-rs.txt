|service| can facilitate a live migration where |com| pushes a source
replica set to an |service| cluster. |service| keeps the target cluster
in sync with the source cluster until you cut your applications over to
the target cluster in |service|.

Once you reach the cutover step in the following procedure, stop the writes
to the source cluster: stop your application instances, point them to the
|service| cluster, and restart them.

Restrictions
------------

- You cannot select an ``M0`` (Free Tier) or ``M2/M5`` shared cluster
  as the target cluster for live migration. To migrate from an ``M0``
  (Free Tier) or ``M2/M5`` shared cluster to a paid cluster, see :doc:`/scale-cluster`.

To live migrate a sharded cluster, see :doc:`/import/migrate-from-com-sharded`.

Live Migration Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section outlines the workflow. For detailed steps,
see the :ref:`procedure for migrating a replica set from Ops Manager or
Cloud Manager to Atlas <lm-com-procedure-rs>`.

Migration Path and Supported Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/live-migration-from-com-platforms.rst

|service| live migration (push) supports the following migration paths:

.. _lm-com-migration-validation-rs:

Pre-Migration Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the live migration procedure, |service| runs validation
checks on the source and target clusters.

- The source cluster is a replica set.

  If the source is a standalone, :opsmgr:`convert </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/>`
  the standalone MongoDB node in Ops Manager, or
  :cloudmgr:`convert </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/>`
  the standalone MongoDB node in |mms| to a single-node
  replica set and then live migrate it to |service| using the procedure
  in this section.

- The target |service| cluster must be a replica set.

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-network-encryption-push-migration.rst

Target Cluster Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the target cluster, consider the following:

- The target |service| cluster must be a replica set.

- You can't select an ``M0`` (Free Tier) or ``M2/M5`` shared-tier
  cluster as the target for live migration.

- Do **not** change the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` flag while
  |service| live migration is running.

Migrating from MongoDB Community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are :opsmgr:`migrating </tutorial/migrate-community-to-atlas>`
to |service| from MongoDB Community using |onprem|, you must accept
the :opsmgr:`Ops Manager Migration Agreement
</reference/legal/live-migration-atlas-licensing>` as the first step
in the :ref:`Live Migration procedure <lm-com-procedure-rs>`.

Migrate Your Cluster
--------------------

.. important::

   Avoid making changes to the source cluster configuration while the
   live migration procedure runs, such as removing replica set members
   or modifying :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` runtime settings, such as
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion``.
