Partition-Based Sync is an older mode for using Atlas Device Sync with the 
Realm Swift SDK. We recommend using :ref:`Flexible Sync <ios-flexible-sync-fundamentals>` 
for new apps. The information on this page is for users who are still 
using Partition-Based Sync.

.. tip::

   Realm Swift SDK v10.40.0 and newer supports the ability to migrate from 
   Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync. For more information, refer to: 
   :ref:`ios-migrate-pbs-to-fs`.

For more information about Partition-Based Sync and how to configure it
in Atlas App Services, refer to :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>`
in the App Services documentation.

Open a Partition-Based Sync Realm
---------------------------------

When you select :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>` for your 
backend App configuration, your client implementation must include a 
partition value. This is the value of the :ref:`partition key 
<partition-key>` field you select when you configure Partition-Based Sync. 

The partition value determines which data the client application can access.

You pass in the partition value when you open a synced realm.

Initialize a synced realm with a :swift-sdk:`sync configuration <Extensions/User.html#/s:So7RLMUserC10RealmSwiftE13configuration14partitionValueAC0B0V13ConfigurationVx_tAC4BSONRzlF>`.
This enables you to specify a partition value whose data should sync to the realm.

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      Pass a logged-in user's :swift-sdk:`configuration <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>` 
      object with the desired :ref:`partition value <partition-value>` to 
      :swift-sdk:`realm initializers 
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13configuration5queueA2C13ConfigurationV_So012OS_dispatch_D0CSgtKcfc>`.

      You can optionally :ref:`specify whether a realm should download 
      changes before opening <ios-specify-download-behavior>`. If you do not
      specify download behavior, this opens a realm with data that is on
      the device, and attempts to sync changes in the background.

         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      The first time you log in and open a synced realm, you'll log in the
      user, and pass the user's :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncConfiguration 
      <Classes/RLMRealmConfiguration.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealmConfiguration(py)syncConfiguration>` 
      object with the desired :objc-sdk:`partitionValue 
      <Classes/RLMSyncConfiguration.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMSyncConfiguration(py)partitionValue>` 
      to :objc-sdk:`+[RLMRealm realmWithConfiguration:error:]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(cm)realmWithConfiguration:error:>`.

      This opens a synced realm on the device. The realm 
      attempts to sync with your App in the background to check for changes 
      on the server, or upload changes that the user has made.

Open Non-Synced Realm as a Synced Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.23.0

If you want a non-synced realm to start syncing with other devices and your 
App Services backend, you can use the :swift-sdk:`writeCopy(configuration: ) 
<Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9writeCopy13configurationyAC13ConfigurationV_tKF>` 
method to make a copy of the non-synced realm for use with a sync configuration. 
The example below creates a copy of a non-synced realm file, with all of 
its existing data, that you can use with a sync configuration.

After you copy the realm for use with Sync, you can open the copy as a 
synced realm. Any changes you make to the synced realm will reflect 
in the synced realm file, and they will also propagate to other devices and
the App Services backend.

Open a Synced Realm as a Non-Synced Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.23.0

.. tip::

   You may temporarily pause a Sync session if you do not want to permanently
   change a synced realm to a non-synced realm. See: :ref:`Suspend or Resume 
   a Sync Session <ios-suspend-or-resume-a-sync-session>`.

If you want to permanently stop a realm from syncing to your App Services backend,
you can use the :swift-sdk:`writeCopy(configuration: ) 
<Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9writeCopy13configurationyAC13ConfigurationV_tKF>` 
method to make a copy of a synced realm for use with a non-sync configuration.
The example below creates a copy of the realm file, with all of its existing 
data, at a file URL you specify. 

This process removes the ``realm_id`` in the local realm. You must :ref:`increment 
the schema version as if you had deleted a property <ios-delete-a-property>`.

After you copy the realm for use without Sync, you can open the copy as a 
non-synced realm. Any changes you make to the non-synced realm reflect 
only in the local realm file. No changes propagate to other devices or
the App Services backend.

.. _ios-migrate-pbs-to-fs:

Migrate from Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync
--------------------------------------------------

You can migrate your App Services Device Sync Mode from Partition-Based Sync 
to Flexible Sync. Migrating is an automatic process that does not require 
any changes to your application code. Automatic migration requires Realm 
Swift SDK version 10.40.0 or newer. 

Migrating enables you to keep your existing App Services users and 
authentication configuration. Flexible Sync provides more versatile permissions
configuration options and more granular data synchronization.

For more information about how to migrate your App Services App from 
Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync, refer to :ref:`Migrate Device Sync Modes 
<realm-sync-migrate-modes>`.

.. _ios-update-client-code-after-pbs-to-fs-migration:

Updating Client Code After Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The automatic migration from Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync does not
require any changes to your client code. However, to support this 
functionality, Realm automatically handles the differences between the two 
Sync Modes by:

- Automatically creating Flexible Sync subscriptions for each object type 
  where ``partitionKey == partitionValue``.
- Injecting a ``partitionKey`` field into every object if one does not already 
  exist. This is required for the automatic Flexible Sync subscription.

If you need to make updates to your client code after migration, consider 
updating your client codebase to remove hidden migration functionality.
You might want update your client codebase when:

- You add a new model or change a model in your client codebase
- You add or change functionality that involves reading or writing Realm objects
- You want to implement more fine-grained control over what data you sync

Make these changes to convert your Partition-Based Sync client code to use 
Flexible Sync:

- Switch to a ``flexibleSyncConfiguration()`` where you :ref:`open a synced realm 
  <ios-flexible-sync-open-realm>`.
- Add relevant properties to your object models to use in your Flexible Sync 
  subscriptions. For example, you might add an ``ownerId`` property to enable
  a user to sync only their own data.
- Remove automatic Flexible Sync subscriptions and manually create the 
  relevant subscriptions.

For examples of Flexible Sync permissions strategies, including examples of 
how to model data for these strategies, refer to :ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide`.

Remove and Manually Create Subscriptions
````````````````````````````````````````

When you migrate from Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync, Realm
automatically creates hidden Flexible Sync subscriptions for your app. The 
next time you add or change subscriptions, we recommend that you:

1. :ref:`Remove the automatically-generated subscriptions <ios-remove-subscriptions>`. 
2. :ref:`Manually add the relevant subscriptions in your client codebase <ios-sync-add-subscription>`.

This enables you to see all of your subscription logic together in your 
codebase for future iteration and debugging.

For more information about the automatically-generated Flexible Sync 
subscriptions, refer to :ref:`realm-sync-migrate-client`.
