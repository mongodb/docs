Create an |service| User Account
--------------------------------

To get started with |service|, create your user account and log in to
|service|. If you are an existing |mms| user, you can use your |mms|
credentials.

.. note::

   Similar to |mms|, creating a user for |service| also creates the user on
   `jira.mongodb.org <http://jira.mongodb.org>`_. If you later change the
   user's password or email address in |service|, you will also
   change the password or email address in `jira.mongodb.org
   <http://jira.mongodb.org>`_.

Once logged in, create an |service| group.

Create an |service| Group
-------------------------

Your group will manage your MongoDB deployments. You can give other
|service| users access to your group, allowing them to log into the
group and manage your deployments.

Once you create your |service| user account and log in:

.. Outstanding Questions
.. ---------------------

.. Can a user have multiple payment methods?

.. If a user has an existing Cloud Manager group with no hosts, can they
   convert that to an Atlas group? Is there a UI for that?

.. An account = a registered user.
.. An account != group.
.. Billing is at the group level, not the account level.
