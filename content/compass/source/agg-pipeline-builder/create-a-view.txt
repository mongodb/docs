Create a View from Pipeline Results

To quickly access the results of an aggregation pipeline without having to 
run it, you can create a :ref:`view <compass-views>` on |compass|. Views are 
read-only, so they can help keep your data secure by limiting user access to a 
predefined set of results. 

About this Task 
---------------

Creating a view does not save the aggregation pipeline itself. 

Steps
-----

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Save` drop-down button

      In the aggregation pipeline pane, click the :guilabel:`Save` drop-down 
      button and select :guilabel:`Create view`.

      .. figure:: /images/compass/query-save-pipeline-as.png
         :alt: Save drop-down button

   .. step:: Enter a name for your view

      The view name must be between 6 and 1024 characters long.

   .. step:: Create your view 

      Click the :guilabel:`Create` button to create your view. |compass-short| 
      creates a view from your pipeline results in the same database where the 
      pipeline was created and displays saved views with the :icon-fa5:`eye` 
      icon.
