MongoDB Tag Aware Sharding allows administrators to control data distribution
in a sharded cluster by defining ranges of the :term:`shard key` and tagging
them to one or more shards.

This tutorial uses :ref:`zone-sharding` along with a multi-datacenter
sharded cluster deployment and application-side logic to support distributed
local writes, as well as high write availability in the event of a replica set
election or datacenter failure.

.. important::

   The concepts discussed in this tutorial require a specific deployment
   architecture, as well as application-level logic.

   These concepts require familiarity with MongoDB :term:`sharded clusters
   <sharded cluster>`, :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, and the general
   behavior of :ref:`zones <zone-sharding>`.

   This tutorial assumes an insert-only or insert-intensive workload. The
   concepts and strategies discussed in this tutorial are not well suited for
   use cases that require fast reads or updates.

Scenario
--------

Consider an insert-intensive application, where reads are infrequent and low
priority compared to writes. The application writes documents to a sharded
collection, and requires near-constant uptime from the
database to support its SLAs or SLOs.

The following represents a partial view of the format of documents the
application writes to the database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fa"),
      "message_id" : 329620,
      "datacenter" : "alfa",
      "userid" : 123,
      ...
   }
   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fb"),
      "message_id" : 578494,
      "datacenter" : "bravo",
      "userid" : 456,
      ...
   }
   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fc"),
      "message_id" : 689979,
      "datacenter" : "bravo",
      "userid" : 789,
      ...
   }

Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~

The collection uses the ``{ datacenter : 1, userid : 1 }`` compound index as
the :term:`shard key`.

The ``datacenter`` field in each document allows for creating a tag range on
each distinct datacenter value. Without the ``datacenter`` field, it would not
be possible to associate a document with a specific datacenter.

The ``userid`` field provides a high :ref:`cardinality <shard-key-cardinality>`
and low :ref:`frequency <shard-key-frequency>` component to the shard key
relative to ``datacenter``.

See :ref:`Choosing a Shard Key <sharding-shard-key-requirements>` for more
general instructions on selecting a shard key.

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The deployment consists of two datacenters, ``alfa`` and ``bravo``. There are
two shards, ``shard0000`` and ``shard0001``. Each shard is a :term:`replica
set` with three members. ``shard0000`` has two members on ``alfa`` and one
:ref:`priority 0 member <replica-set-secondary-only-members>` on ``bravo``.
``shard0001`` has two members on ``bravo`` and one :ref:`priority 0 member
<replica-set-secondary-only-members>` on ``alfa``.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-high-availability-architecture.rst

.. _sharding-high-availability-tags:

Tags
~~~~

This application requires one tag per datacenter. Each shard has one
tag assigned to it based on the datacenter containing the majority of
its replica set members. There are two tag ranges, one for each datacenter.

``alfa`` Datacenter
   Tag shards with a majority of members on this datacenter as ``alfa``.

   Create a tag range with:

   * a lower bound of ``{ "datacenter" : "alfa", "userid" : MinKey }``,
   * an upper bound of ``{ "datacenter" : "alfa", "userid" : MaxKey }``, and
   * the tag ``alfa``

``bravo`` Datacenter
   Tag shards with a majority of members on this datacenter as ``bravo``.

   Create a tag range with:

   * a lower bound of ``{ "datacenter" : "bravo", "userid" : MinKey }``,
   * an upper bound of ``{ "datacenter" : "bravo", "userid" : MaxKey }``, and
   * the tag ``bravo``

.. note::

   The :bsontype:`MinKey` and
   :bsontype:`MaxKey` values are reserved special
   values for comparisons

Based on the
configured tags and tag ranges, :binary:`~bin.mongos` routes documents with
``datacenter : alfa`` to the ``alfa`` datacenter, and documents with
``datacenter : bravo`` to the ``bravo`` datacenter.

Write Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an inserted or updated document matches a configured tag range, it can only
be written to a shard with the related tag.

MongoDB can write documents that do not match a configured tag range to any
shard in the cluster.

.. note::

   The behavior described above requires the cluster to be in a steady state
   with no chunks violating a configured tag range. See the following section
   on the :ref:`balancer <sharding-high-availability-writes-balancing>` for
   more information.

.. _sharding-high-availability-writes-balancing:

Balancer
~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` :ref:`migrates
<sharding-chunk-migration>` the tagged chunks to the appropriate shard. Until
the migration, shards may contain chunks that violate configured tag ranges
and tags. Once balancing completes, shards should only contain chunks whose
ranges do not violate its assigned tags and tag ranges.

Adding or removing tags or tag ranges can result in chunk migrations.
Depending on the size of your data set and the number of chunks a tag range
affects, these migrations may impact cluster performance. Consider running
your :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` during specific scheduled windows.
See :ref:`sharding-schedule-balancing-window` for a tutorial on how to set a
scheduling window.


.. _sharding-high-availability-application-behavior:

Application Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the application writes to the nearest datacenter. If the local
datacenter is down, or if writes to that datacenter are not acknowledged
within a set time period, the application switches to the other available
datacenter by changing the value of the ``datacenter`` field before attempting
to write the document to the database.

The application supports write timeouts. The application uses
:ref:`write-concern` to set a :ref:`timeout <wc-wtimeout>` for each write
operation.

If the application encounters a write or timeout error, it modifies the
``datacenter`` field in each document and performs the write. This routes the
document to the other datacenter. If both datacenters are down, then writes
cannot succeed. See :ref:`sharding-high-availability-write-failure`.

The application periodically checks connectivity to any data
centers marked as "down". If connectivity is restored, the application can
continue performing normal write operations.

Given the switching logic, as well as any load balancers or similar mechanisms
in place to handle client traffic between datacenters, the application cannot
predict which of the two datacenters a given document was written to. To
ensure that no documents are missed as a part of read operations, the
application *must* perform :ref:`broadcast queries
<sharding-mongos-broadcast>` by *not* including the ``datacenter`` field as a
part of any query.

The application performs reads using a :ref:`read preference
<read-preference>` of :readmode:`nearest` to reduce latency.

It is possible for a write operation to succeed despite a reported timeout
error. The application responds to the error by attempting to re-write
the document to the other datacenter - this can result in a document being
duplicated across both datacenters. The application resolves duplicates
as a part of the :ref:`read
<sharding-high-availability-writes-read-resolution>` logic.

Switching Logic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application has logic to switch datacenters if one or more writes fail, or
if writes are not :ref:`acknowledged <write-concern>` within a set time
period. The application modifies the ``datacenter`` field based on the target
datacenter's :ref:`tag <sharding-high-availability-tags>` to direct the
document towards that datacenter.

For example, an application attempting to write to the ``alfa`` datacenter
might follow this general procedure:

#. Attempt to write document, specifying ``datacenter : alfa``.
#. On write timeout or error, log ``alfa`` as momentarily down.
#. Attempt to write same document, modifying ``datacenter : bravo``.
#. On write timeout or error, log ``bravo`` as momentarily down.
#. If both ``alfa`` and ``bravo`` are down, log and report errors.

See :ref:`sharding-high-availability-write-failure`.

Procedure
---------

.. _sharding-high-availability-write-configure-tags:

Configure Shard Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must be connected to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` associated with the target
:term:`sharded cluster` in order to proceed. You cannot create tags by
connecting directly to a :term:`shard` replica set member.

.. include:: /includes/steps/sharding-high-availability.rst

.. _sharding-high-availability-write-failure:

Resolve Write Failure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the application's default datacenter is down or inaccessible, the
application changes the ``datacenter`` field to the other
datacenter.

For example, the application attempts to write the following document to the
``alfa`` datacenter by default:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fa"),
      "message_id" : 329620,
      "datacenter" : "alfa",
      "userid" : 123,
      ...
   }

If the application receives an error on attempted write, or if the write
acknowledgement takes too long, the application logs the datacenter as
unavailable and alters the ``datacenter`` field to point to the ``bravo``
datacenter.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c457fe58b2e96f595fb"),
      "message_id" : 329620,
      "datacenter" : "bravo",
      "userid" : 123,
      ...
   }

The application periodically checks the ``alfa`` datacenter for
connectivity. If the datacenter is reachable again, the application can resume
normal writes.

.. note::

   It is possible that the original write to ``datacenter : alfa`` succeeded,
   especially if the error was related to a :ref:`timeout <wc-wtimeout>`.
   If so, the document with ``message_id : 329620`` may now be duplicated
   across both datacenters. Applications must resolve duplicates as a part
   of :ref:`read operations
   <sharding-high-availability-writes-read-resolution>`.

.. _sharding-high-availability-writes-read-resolution:

Resolve Duplicate Documents on Reads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application's switching logic allows for potential document duplication.
When performing reads, the application resolves any duplicate documents on the
application layer.

The following query searches for documents where the ``userid`` is ``123``.
Note that while ``userid`` is part of the shard key, the query does not
include the ``datacenter`` field, and therefore does not perform a
:ref:`targeted read operation <sharding-mongos-targeted>`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { "userid" : 123 } )

The results show that the document with ``message_id`` of ``329620`` has been
inserted into MongoDB twice, probably as a result of a delayed write
acknowledgement.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fa"),
     "message_id" : 329620
     "datacenter" : "alfa",
     "userid" : 123,
     data : {...}
   }
   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c457fe58b2e96f595fb"),
     "message_id" : 329620
     "datacenter" : "bravo",
     "userid" : 123,
     ...
   }

The application can either ignore the duplicates, taking one of the two
documents, or it can attempt to trim the duplicates until only a single
document remains.

One method for trimming duplicates is to use the
:method:`ObjectId.getTimestamp()` method to extract the timestamp from the
``_id`` field. The application can then keep either the first document
inserted, or the last document inserted. This assumes the
``_id`` field uses the MongoDB :method:`ObjectId`.

For example, using :method:`~ObjectId.getTimestamp()` on the document
with ``ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fa")`` returns:

.. code-block:: javascript

   ISODate("2016-03-22T00:05:24Z")

Using :method:`~ObjectId.getTimestamp()` on the document with
``ObjectId("56f08c457fe58b2e96f595fb")`` returns:

.. code-block:: javascript

   ISODate("2016-03-22T00:05:25Z")
