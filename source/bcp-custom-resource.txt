``AtlasBackupCompliancePolicy`` Custom Resource

   :class: singlecol

The ``AtlasBackupCompliancePolicy`` custom resource configures a 
:ref:`{+bcp+} <backup-compliance-policy>` that applies to the 
:ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource` to protect your backup data. When 
you create the ``AtlasBackupCompliancePolicy`` custom resource, |ak8so| 
tries to create or update a {+bcp+}.

|ak8so| does one of the following actions using the |service| 
:oas-atlas-op:`Backup Compliance Policy API Resource 
</CloudBackups/operation/updateDataProtectionSettings>`:
   
- Creates a new {+bcp+}.
- Updates an existing {+bcp+}.

.. important::

   See the :ref:`ak8so-bcp-prohibited-actions` and
   :ref:`ak8so-bcp-considerations`. A {+bcp+} applies as the minimum 
   backup policy to all {+clusters+} in the project. The {+bcp+} 
   protects all existing snapshots. The {+bcp+} prevents any user, 
   regardless of role, from modifying or deleting existing 
   snapshots prior to their expiration. Changes made to this 
   {+bcp+} apply only to future snapshots. If you enable a 
   {+bcp+}, the {+bcp+} limits your ability to reduce backup 
   storage costs. You can't adjust the retention or delete a 
   backup to reduce the backup storage costs.

descriptions, the available examples, and the |api| documentation to 
customize your specifications.

.. setting:: spec.authorizedEmail

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   Email address of an authorized security or legal representative.

   .. important::

      An invalid or incorrect email address prevents you from 
      modifying or enabling this {+bcp+} until you correct it 
      with MongoDB Support.

.. setting:: spec.authorizedUserFirstName

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   First name of an authorized security or legal representative.

.. setting:: spec.authorizedUserLastName

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   Last name of an authorized security or legal representative.

.. setting:: spec.copyProtectionEnabled

   *Type*: boolean

   *Optional*

   Flag that indicates whether to 
   :ref:`keep all snapshots when removing additional snapshot regions 
   <snapshot-distribution>`. This parameter defaults to ``false``.

   .. note::

      You can prevent {+cluster+} users from deleting backups copied to 
      other regions even if you change this parameter to ``false``. To 
      learn more, see :ref:`snapshot-distribution`.

.. setting:: spec.encryptionAtRestEnabled

   *Type*: boolean

   *Optional*

   Flag that indicates whether to :ref:`require Encryption at Rest using Customer Key Management for all clusters 
   <ak8so-ear>`. This parameter defaults to 
   ``false``.

   .. note::

      To enable this option, you must :ref:`Enable Encryption at Rest 
      <ak8so-ear>` for all current {+clusters+}. You 
      can't enable this option on :ref:`paused {+clusters+} 
      <paused-cluster-considerations>` that don't have Encryption at 
      Rest enabled.

.. setting:: spec.onDemandPolicy

   *Type*: object

   *Optional*

   Object that contains the settings for the on-demand snapshot policy 
   item.

.. setting:: spec.onDemandPolicy.frequencyInterval

   *Type*: number

   *Required*

   Number that indicates the desired frequency of the policy item 
   specified by :setting:`spec.onDemandPolicy.frequencyType`. A value 
   of ``1`` specifies the first instance of the corresponding
   :setting:`spec.onDemandPolicy.frequencyType`.

   .. example::

      - In a monthly {+bcp+}, ``1`` indicates that the monthly
        snapshot occurs on the first day of the month.
      - In a weekly {+bcp+}, ``1`` indicates that the weekly
        snapshot occurs on Monday.

   This setting accepts the following frequency values:

   - Hourly: ``1``, ``2``, ``4``, ``6``, ``8``, and ``12``.
   - Daily: ``1``.
   - Weekly: ``1`` through ``7``, where ``1`` is Monday and ``7`` is
     Sunday.
   - Monthly: ``1`` through ``28`` and ``40``, where ``1`` is the first
     day of the month and ``40`` is the last day of the month.

.. setting:: spec.onDemandPolicy.frequencyType

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   String that indicates the frequency associated with the policy item. 
   Accepted values are: ``hourly``, ``daily``, ``weekly``, or 
   ``monthly``.

   .. note::

      You can't specify multiple ``hourly`` and ``daily`` backup policy
      onDemandPolicy.

.. setting:: spec.onDemandPolicy.retentionUnit

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   String that indicates the scope of the policy item. Together
   with :setting:`spec.onDemandPolicy.retentionValue`, these settings 
   define the length of time to retain snapshots. Accepted values are: 
   ``days``, ``weeks``, or ``months``.

.. setting:: spec.onDemandPolicy.retentionValue

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   String that indicates the value to associate with 
   :setting:`spec.onDemandPolicy.retentionUnit`. Together with
   :setting:`spec.onDemandPolicy.retentionUnit`, these settings define
   the length of time to retain snapshots.

.. setting:: spec.overwriteBackupPolicies

   *Type*: boolean

   *Required*

   Flag that indicates whether to upgrade all backup policies in the 
   project regardless of what is specified in the 
   :ref:`atlasbackuppolicy-custom-resource`.
   
   .. important::

      If you set this parameter to ``true``, |service| upgrades all 
      backup policies in the project regardless of what is specified in 
      the :ref:`atlasbackuppolicy-custom-resource`. |service| overrides 
      the :ref:`atlasbackuppolicy-custom-resource` and the status 
      of that custom resource updates to ``Ready: False``. You must 
      manually update the :ref:`atlasbackuppolicy-custom-resource` to 
      align with the {+bcp+}.
      
      If you set this parameter to ``false``, creating the {+bcp+} 
      fails if the existing backup policies do not satisfy the {+bcp+}.

.. setting:: spec.pitEnabled

    *Type*: boolean

    *Optional*

    Flag that indicates whether to require a point in time restore to 
    all {+clusters+}. This parameter defaults to ``false``.

.. setting:: spec.restoreWindowDays

   *Type*: number

   *Conditional*

   Number of days in the restore window for point in time restore. If 
   you set :setting:`spec.pitEnabled` to ``true``, you must specify 
   this parameter.

   .. important::

      You can't configure a restore window that is longer than 
      the :ref:`Hourly Snapshot Retention Time 
      <creating-backup-policy>`. After you save this {+bcp+}, you 
      can't change this setting without MongoDB support. To 
      change this setting, the security or legal representative 
      specified for the {+bcp+} must :ref:`request support 
      <request-support>` and complete an extensive verification 
      process.

.. setting:: spec.scheduledPolicyItems

   *Type*: object

   *Optional*

   Object that contains the settings for the snapshot policy items.

.. setting:: spec.scheduledPolicyItems.frequencyInterval

   *Type*: number

   *Required*

   Number that indicates the desired frequency of the policy item 
   specified by :setting:`spec.scheduledPolicyItems.frequencyType`. A 
   value of ``1`` specifies the first instance of the corresponding
   :setting:`spec.scheduledPolicyItems.frequencyType`.

   .. example::

      - In a monthly {+bcp+}, ``1`` indicates that the monthly
        snapshot occurs on the first day of the month.
      - In a weekly {+bcp+}, ``1`` indicates that the weekly
        snapshot occurs on Monday.

   This setting accepts the following frequency values:

   - Hourly: ``1``, ``2``, ``4``, ``6``, ``8``, and ``12``.
   - Daily: ``1``.
   - Weekly: ``1`` through ``7``, where ``1`` is Monday and ``7`` is
     Sunday.
   - Monthly: ``1`` through ``28`` and ``40``, where ``1`` is the first
     day of the month and ``40`` is the last day of the month.

.. setting:: spec.scheduledPolicyItems.frequencyType

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   String that indicates the frequency associated with the policy item. 
   Accepted values are: ``hourly``, ``daily``, ``weekly``, or 
   ``monthly``.

   .. note::

      You can't specify multiple ``hourly`` and ``daily`` backup policy
      scheduledPolicyItems.

.. setting:: spec.scheduledPolicyItems.retentionUnit

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   String that indicates the scope of the policy item. Together
   with :setting:`spec.scheduledPolicyItems.retentionValue`, these 
   settings define the length of time to retain snapshots. Accepted 
   values are: ``days``, ``weeks``, or ``months``.

.. setting:: spec.scheduledPolicyItems.retentionValue

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   String that indicates the value to associate with 
   :setting:`spec.scheduledPolicyItems.retentionUnit`. Together with
