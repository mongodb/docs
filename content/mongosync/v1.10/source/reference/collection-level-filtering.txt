Starting in 1.1, ``mongosync`` supports inclusion filters to specify which
databases and collections to include in sync.  Starting in 1.6, ``mongosync``
also supports exclusion filters and regular expressions.

- With inclusion filters, ``mongosync`` syncs matching
  databases and collections.
- With exclusion filters, ``mongosync`` syncs all databases
  and collections, except for those that match the filters.
- With both inclusion and exclusion filters, ``mongosync`` only syncs
  databases and collections that match the inclusion filters then excludes
  any that also match the exclusion filters.
- With no filters, ``mongosync`` syncs all databases and collections.

.. _c2c-filter-syntax:

Filter Syntax
-------------

The :ref:`c2c-api-start` API endpoint accepts two fields that configure 
filtered sync: ``includeNamespaces`` and ``excludeNamespaces``.
Each field takes an array of filters that specify the databases and collections 
to include or exclude from sync.

.. note::

   If the :ref:`c2c-api-start` call uses both ``includeNamespaces`` and 
   ``excludeNamespaces`` parameters, ``mongosync`` first matches databases
   and collections from the inclusion filters, then excludes those that
   also match an exclusion filter.

Filters have the following syntax:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/collection-level-filtering/1.json
   :language: json
   :copyable: false

Filters must include either the ``database`` field or the ``databaseRegex`` field.

If you need the filter to match specific collections, you can use either 
the ``collections`` array to specify collections individually or define 
a regular expression using the ``collectionsRegex`` field.

.. _c2c-configure-filter:

Configure a Filter
------------------

.. important::

   Once you start ``mongosync`` with a filter in place, the filter
   cannot be modified. If you do need to create a new filter,
   see: :ref:`mongosync-restart-migration`.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Identify Databases and Collections.

      Identify the databases and collections that you want to sync to
      the destination cluster. 

      - When you add a set of databases to the filter, you also exclude any
        other databases in the cluster.
      
      - When you specify a collection in your filter, you also exclude any
        other collections that are in the same database.

   .. step:: Create a Filter.

      The :ref:`c2c-api-start` API accepts two parameters that configure
      optional filters: 
      
      - The ``includeNamespaces`` parameter takes an array of filters, which
        are used to determines which databases and collections ``mongosync`` 
        should include in the sync.
      - The ``excludeNamespaces`` parameter takes an array of filters, which
        are used to determine which databases and collections ``mongosync``
        should exclude from the sync.
     
      If you don't specify a filter, ``mongosync`` performs a full cluster
      sync.

      Create inclusion and/or exclusion filters to identify the databases and
      collections you want to sync.

      For example, this inclusion filter would configure ``mongosync`` to only
      sync collections whose names begin with ``accounts_`` from the ``sales`` 
      database, except for the ``accounts_old`` collection:

      .. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/collection-level-filtering/2.json
         :language: json

      For more information on filters, see :ref:`c2c-filter-syntax`. 

   .. step:: Use the Filter.

      To use the filter, attach the filter json when you make the
      :ref:`/start <c2c-api-start>` API call to begin syncing.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/start-filtered.sh
         :language: bash

For an example configuration, see: :ref:`c2c-example-start-with-filter`.

.. _c2c-change-filter:

Replace an Existing Filter
--------------------------

You cannot update an existing filter. You must stop the ongoing sync
process, prepare the destination cluster, and restart ``mongosync`` with
a new filter. To restart ``mongosync``, see :ref:`mongosync-restart-migration`.

.. _c2c-filter-renaming-collections:

Adding and Renaming Collections
-------------------------------

You can, with some restrictions, add or :method:`rename a collection
<db.collection.renameCollection>` during a filtered sync.

.. warning::

   If your renaming operation violates the renaming restrictions,
   ``mongosync`` stops syncing and reports an error.

   To clean up and restart after an error, follow the steps to
   :ref:`replace an existing filter <c2c-change-filter>`.

Adding and Renaming Within a Single Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add new collections or rename an existing collection if the
entire database is part of the filter. 

You can also rename a collection if the old name and the new name are
both specified in the filter. 

See the :ref:`renaming examples <c2c-example-rename-while-syncing>`.

Renaming Across Different Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only rename a collection across databases if the entire target
database is part of a filter. If the filter specifies individual
collections in the target database, renaming across databases does not
work.

See the :ref:`renaming examples <c2c-example-rename-while-syncing>`.


.. _c2c-filter-with-out:

Filtering with mapReduce and $out
---------------------------------

To use the :pipeline:`$out` aggregation stage or
the :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command (when set to create
or replace a collection) with filtering, you must 
filter the whole database and not just
the specified collection.

For example, consider this aggregation pipeline:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/collection-level-filtering/6.js
   :language: javascript

The ``$out`` stage creates the ``authors`` collection in the ``library``
database. If you want to sync the ``authors`` collection, you must
specify the entire ``library`` database in your filter. The filter will
not work if you only specify the ``authors`` collection.

This filter works:

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/collection-level-filtering/7.json
   :language: json

This filter does not work: 

.. literalinclude:: /code-examples/reference/collection-level-filtering/8.json
   :language: json
