.. dbcommand:: logRotate

   The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is an administrative command that
   allows you to rotate
   the MongoDB logs to prevent a single logfile from consuming too
   much disk space.

   You must issue the
   :dbcommand:`logRotate`
   command against the :term:`admin database` in the form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

        { logRotate: 1 }

   .. note::

      Your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance needs to be running with the
      :option:`--logpath [file] <mongod --logpath>` option.

   You may also rotate the logs by sending a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` process.
   If your :binary:`~bin.mongod` has a process ID of 2200, here's how to
   send the signal on Linux:

   .. code-block:: sh

       kill -SIGUSR1 2200

Behavior
--------

.. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

The :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` setting or :option:`--logRotate <mongod --logRotate>` option
specify :dbcommand:`logRotate`'s behavior.

When :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or :option:`--logRotate <mongod --logRotate>` are set to
``rename``, :dbcommand:`logRotate` renames the existing log file by
appending the current timestamp to the filename. The appended timestamp
has the following form:

.. code-block:: none

   <YYYY>-<mm>-<DD>T<HH>-<MM>-<SS>

Then :dbcommand:`logRotate` creates a new log file with the same
name as originally specified by the :setting:`systemLog.path` setting to
:binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

When :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or :option:`--logRotate <mongod --logRotate>` are set to
``reopen``, :dbcommand:`logRotate` follows the typical Linux/Unix
behavior, and simply closes the log file, and then reopens a log file
with the same name. With ``reopen``, :binary:`~bin.mongod` expects that
another process renames the file prior to the rotation, and that the
reopen results in the creation of a new file.

.. :error:`16175` is thrown if logRotate fails
