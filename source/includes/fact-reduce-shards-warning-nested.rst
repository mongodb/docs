:gold:`IMPORTANT:` When you remove a shard, |service| uses the :manual:`movePrimary
</reference/command/movePrimary/>` command to move any unsharded databases in
that shard to a remaining shard: 
 
- All sharded collections remain online and available during the shard removal
  process. However, read or write operations to unsharded collections during 
  the ``movePrimary`` operation can result in unexpected behavior, including
  migration failure or data loss.
- We recommend moving the primary shard for any databases containing unsharded
  collections before removing the shard.
- For more information, see :manual:`Remove Shards from an Existing Sharded
  Cluster </tutorial/remove-shards-from-cluster/>`.
