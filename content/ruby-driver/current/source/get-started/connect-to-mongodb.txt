   :style: connected

   .. step:: Edit your {+language+} application file

      Navigate to your ``quickstart.rb`` file in the ``ruby-quickstart``
      directory. Copy and paste the following code below the Bundler
      code from the :ref:`ruby-quick-start-download-and-install` step 
      of this tutorial. This code connects to MongoDB and queries the
      ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/quickstart.rb
         :language: ruby
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-query
         :end-before: end-query

   .. step:: Assign the connection string

      Replace the ``<connection string>`` placeholder with the 
      connection string that you copied from the :ref:`ruby-get-started-connection-string`
      step of this tutorial.

   .. step:: Run your {+language+} application

      From your ``ruby-quickstart`` directory, run the following shell
      command to run the application:
      
      .. code-block:: none

         ruby quickstart.rb

      The command line output contains details about the retrieved movie
      document:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId('...'), "plot"=>"A young man is accidentally sent
         30 years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend,
         Dr. Emmett Brown, and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite
         in order to save his own existence.", ...
         "title"=>"Back to the Future", ...

      If you encounter an error or see no output, ensure that you specified the
      correct connection string in the ``quickstart.rb`` file and that you loaded the
      sample data.

After you complete these steps, you have a working application that
uses the driver to connect to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on
the sample data, and prints out the result.
