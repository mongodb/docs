100.13.0 Changelog
------------------

*Released 2025-08-13*

The highlight for this release is Server 8.2.0 support. Starting
with 8.2.0, when restoring collections with ``mongorestore``,
the ``autoIndexId`` collection creation option will be ignored,
since this is no longer supported with 8.2.0+.

This release also addresses a few reported security
vulnerabilities. Previous releases incorrectly included
development-only library dependencies in the SBOM, which
accounts for the ``aws-sdk-go`` vulnerability report. This package
is still included in the released SBOM because of a bug in our
SSDLC tooling. However, it has never been included in the actual
tools code. In addition, this release was built with Go 1.23.11,
which includes a fix for CVE-2025-22874, present in Go 1.23.8
and earlier. However, this particular vulnerability did not
impact the tools, because they do not use the impacted API.
