.. _faq-atlas-charges:

Are there any charges for enabling and using |fts|?
---------------------------------------------------

No, there are no additional fees or charges for using |fts|. However, you 
might observe an increase in resource utilization on the cluster, depending on 
factors such as the size of the indexed collections or index definitions.

  - :ref:`index-perf`

.. _faq-partial-string:

Can I run partial string matching |fts| queries?
------------------------------------------------

Yes. The following |fts| operators support partial string matching 
queries:

- :ref:`autocomplete-ref`
- :ref:`wildcard-ref`
- :ref:`regex-ref`

.. seealso:: 

   :ref:`partial-match-tutorial`

.. _faq-case-insensitive-search:

Can I perform case-insensitive search with the ``wildcard`` or ``regex`` operator?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. You can use the :ref:`wildcard-ref` and :ref:`regex-ref` operators 
with a :ref:`custom analyzer <custom-analyzers>` to perform a 
case-insensitive search. You can define a :ref:`custom analyzer 
<custom-analyzers>` with the following tokenizer and token filter to 
perform a wildcard case-insensitive search:

- :ref:`keyword-tokenizer-ref` tokenizer
- :ref:`lowercase-tf-ref` token filter

Does ``storedSource`` support case-insensitive collation on fields? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. The |fts| :ref:`storedSource <fts-stored-source-definition>` option stores 
original values. To perform case-insensitive operations after the 
:pipeline:`$search` stage on the results returned using 
:ref:`returnStoredSource <fts-return-stored-source-option>` option, you 
must set the default collation strength of your collection to ``1`` or 
``2`` when you create it, and must not specify a different collation in 
your queries and indexes.

Can I use the shard key to run |fts| queries on specific shards?
----------------------------------------------------------------

No, you can't use the shard key to run |fts| queries on a specific 
shard or a subset of shards. In a sharded cluster environment, |fts| 
queries are scatter-gather queries that run on all the shards.

Do queries run on primary or secondary nodes?
---------------------------------------------

By default, queries run on the primary node. You can configure your read 
preference or use :ref:`replica set tags <replica-set-tags>` to specify 
read preference. To learn more, see :ref:`what-is-fts`.

Can I duplicate an index?
-------------------------

Yes, you can duplicate your index by performing the following:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Open the |fts| index you want to update.
      
      .. procedure::
         :style: connected
         
         .. step:: Navigate to your Search tab.
         
         .. step:: On the index you want to copy, click ``...`` in the :guilabel:`Action` column. 
         
         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Edit With JSON Editor`.
   
   .. step:: Copy the index.
   
   .. step:: Navigate to the Search tab.
   
   .. step:: Create a new |fts| index.

      :ref:`Create a new index <ref-create-index>` with the JSON Editor.
      Paste the index you copied and click :guilabel:`Create Search
      Index`. You can make any edits you want directly in the
      :guilabel:`JSON Editor` or :guilabel:`Visual Index Builder` after
      you create the |fts| index.

.. note:: Work in Progress

   We are currently working on a solution for this that doesn't require
   the steps mentioned above. If you'd like to vote for this feature, or
   submit your feedback, see `this feedback item
   <https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/924868-atlas-search/suggestions/46444396-duplicate-search-index>`__. 

Does |fts| store my entire index in memory?
-------------------------------------------

No, |fts| uses memory for the :ref:`JVM heap metrics
<review-atlas-search-metrics>`, which stores the autocomplete and text
tokens of your search index. Similar to other database engines, |fts|
stores the majority of the index files on the disk, which benefits from
the underlying OS page cache.

Why is my search index disappearing?
------------------------------------

- Double check that you entered the correct database and collection names. 
  If you enter a non-existent database or collection name, the {+atlas-ui+}
  temporarily builds the index and deletes it shortly after.  

- If you use the :pipeline:`$out` aggregation stage to overwrite your 
  collection, you must delete and recreate your search index, as search
  indexes are not copied to destination collections. To learn more, see 
  :manual:`$out Index Constraints </reference/operator/aggregation/out/#index-constraints>`. 

Can I restore |fts| indexes from {+Cloud-Backup+} snapshots? 
------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-fts-indexes-backup-restore.rst

Does |fts| work with :abbr:`CSFLE (Client-Side Field Level Encryption)` encrypting clients?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can use :manual:`CSFLE </core/csfle/>` encrypting clients to 
run |fts| queries against data in MongoDB version 6.0 and later. 

Can I query :abbr:`CSFLE (Client-Side Field Level Encryption)` encrypted data?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, you can't query :manual:`CSFLE </core/csfle/>` encrypted data using 
|fts|.


Can I use Queryable Encryption with |fts|?
----------------------------------------------------

No, :manual:`Queryable Encryption </core/queryable-encryption/>` is
incompatible with |fts|.

Can I use |fts| on time series collections?
-------------------------------------------

No, you can't use |fts| on :manual:`time series
</core/timeseries-collections/>` collections.
