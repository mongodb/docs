Prerequisites
-------------

To create the Quick Start application, you need the following software
installed in your development environment:

- `PHP <https://www.php.net/downloads>`__
- `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md>`__
- A terminal app and shell. For MacOS users, use Terminal or a similar app.
  For Windows users, use PowerShell.

Download and Install the Dependencies
-------------------------------------

Complete the following steps to install and add the {+odm-short+} dependencies
to a Laravel web application.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Install the {+php-extension+}

      {+odm-long+} requires the {+php-extension+} to manage MongoDB
      connections and commands.
      Follow the :php:`Installing the MongoDB PHP Driver with PECL
      <mongodb.installation>` guide to install the {+php-extension+}.

   .. step:: Install Laravel

      Ensure that the version of Laravel you install is compatible with the
      version of the {+odm-short+}. To learn which versions are compatible,
      see the :ref:`laravel-compatibility` page.

      Run the following command to install Laravel:

      .. code-block:: bash

         composer global require laravel/installer

      When the installation completes, the command outputs the following message:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         Using version ^<version number> for laravel/installer

   .. step:: Create a Laravel application

      Run the following command to generate a new Laravel web application
      called ``{+quickstart-app-name+}``:

      .. code-block:: bash

         laravel new {+quickstart-app-name+}

      When the installation completes, the command outputs the following message:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         INFO  Application ready in [{+quickstart-app-name+}]. You can start your local development using:

         ➜ cd {+quickstart-app-name+}
         ➜ php artisan serve

   .. step:: Add a Laravel application encryption key

      Navigate to the application directory you created in the previous step:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd {+quickstart-app-name+}

      Run the following command to add the Laravel application encryption
      key, which is required to encrypt cookies:

      .. code-block:: bash

         php artisan key:generate

   .. step:: Add {+odm-long+} to the dependencies

      Run the following command to add the {+odm-long+} dependency to
      your application:

      .. code-block:: bash

         composer require mongodb/laravel-mongodb:^{+package-version+}

      When the installation completes, verify that the ``composer.json`` file
      includes the following line in the ``require`` object:

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false

         "mongodb/laravel-mongodb": "^{+package-version+}"

      After completing these steps, you have a new Laravel project with
      the {+odm-short+} dependencies installed.
