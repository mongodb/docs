program: mongooplog
name: host
aliases: -h
directive: option
args: <hostname><:port>
description: |
  Specifies a resolvable hostname for the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance to
  which :binary:`~bin.mongooplog` will apply :term:`oplog` operations
  retrieved from the server specified by the :option:`--from <mongooplog
  --from>` option.

  By default {{program}} attempts to connect to a MongoDB instance running
  on the localhost on port number ``27017``.

  To connect to a replica set, specify the :setting:`replica set name
  <~replication.replSetName>` and a seed list of set members. Use the
  following form:

  .. code-block:: none

     <replSetName>/<hostname1><:port>,<hostname2><:port>,<...>

  You can always connect directly to a single MongoDB instance by
  specifying the host and port number directly.
optional: false

program: mongooplog
name: port
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Specifies the port number of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance where
  :binary:`~bin.mongooplog` will apply :term:`oplog` entries. Specify
  this option only if the MongoDB instance to connect to is not
  running on the standard port of ``27017``. You may also specify a
  port number using the :option:`--host <mongooplog --host>` command.

directive: option
args: <path>
description: |
  Specifies a directory, containing MongoDB data files, to which
  :binary:`~bin.mongooplog` will apply operations from the :term:`oplog` of
  the database specified with the :option:`--from <mongooplog --from>`
  option.

  When used, the {{role}} option enables :binary:`~bin.mongo` to
  attach directly to local data files and write data without a running
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

  To run with {{role}}, :binary:`~bin.mongooplog` needs to restrict
  access to the data directory: as a result, no :binary:`~bin.mongod` can be
  access the same path while the process runs.

directive: option

description: |
  Specify a number of seconds of operations for :binary:`~bin.mongooplog` to

  specified the default value is ``86400`` seconds, or 24 hours.

  Specify the host for :binary:`~bin.mongooplog` to retrieve :term:`oplog`
  operations from. :binary:`~bin.mongooplog` *requires* this option.

  Unless you specify the :option:`--host <mongooplog --host>` option,
  :binary:`~bin.mongooplog` will apply the operations collected with this
  option to the oplog of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance running on the
  localhost interface connected to port ``27017``.
optional: true

program: mongooplog
name: oplogns
directive: option
args: <namespace>
description: |
  Specify a namespace in the :option:`--from <mongooplog --from>` host
  where the oplog resides. The default value is ``local.oplog.rs``, which
  is the where :term:`replica set` members store their operation log.
  However, if you've copied :term:`oplog` entries into another
  database or collection or are pulling oplog entries from a
  :doc:`master-slave </core/master-slave>` deployment, use {{role}} to
  apply oplog entries stored in another location. Namespaces take the
  form of ``[database].[collection]``.
