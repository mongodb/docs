   :description: Learn how to use indexes by using the MongoDB Java Reactive Streams driver.
   :keywords: query, optimization, efficiency, usage example, code example

Overview
--------

On this page, you can see copyable code examples that show how to manage different
types of indexes by using the {+driver-short+}.

.. .. tip::

..   To learn more about working with indexes, see the :ref:`java-rs-work-with-indexes`
..   guide. To learn more about any of the indexes shown on this page, see the link
..   provided in each section.

To use an example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <java-rs-index-sample>` or your own application.
Be sure to replace all placeholders in the code examples, such as ``<connection string URI>``, with
the relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.

Project Reactor Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide uses the {+pr+} library to consume ``Publisher`` instances returned
by the {+driver-short+} methods. To learn more about the {+pr+} library
and how to use it, see `Getting Started <https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#getting-started>`__
in the Reactor documentation.

There are also other ways to consume ``Publisher`` instances. You can use one of many alternative libraries such as
`RxJava <https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava>`__ or call ``Publisher.subscribe()`` directly and pass your own
implementation of a ``Subscriber``.

This guide uses the ``Mono.block()`` method from Reactor to subscribe to a ``Publisher`` and block the current
thread until the ``Publisher`` reaches its terminal state. To learn more about the Reactive Streams initiative, see `Reactive Streams <https://www.reactive-streams.org/>`__.

.. important:: Publishers Returned are Cold

   All ``Publisher`` instances returned by the {+driver-short+} methods are cold,
   which means that the corresponding operation does not happen unless you
   subscribe to the returned ``Publisher``. We recommend only subscribing to 
   the returned ``Publisher`` once, because subscribing more than once can lead
   to errors.
