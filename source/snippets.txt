Introduction
------------

A ``snippet`` is a script that is packaged and stored in a registry to
facilitate sharing and reuse.

You can :ref:`write your own scripts <mdb-shell-write-scripts>` in
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` to manipulate data or to perform administrative
tasks. Snippets are an improvement on locally stored scripts because
they can be easily shared and maintained. 

This page provides a high level introduction to working with snippets.
The links in each section go deeper into writing, managing, and working
with snippets.
  
Components
----------

The Snippets feature has three main components:

- **Scripts** are code that can be used with :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.
- **Packages** are scripts that are bundled with metadata so they can be
  managed more easily.
- **Registries** are collections of packages that can be shared.

There are also built in :ref:`commands <snip-commands>` to help you
work with snippets and utility scripts to help with
:ref:`packaging tasks <snip-make-a-registry-index>`. 

Get Started
-----------

The fastest way to get started with snippets is to try one of the 
snippets in the `community registry
<https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongosh-snippets/tree/main/snippets>`__
maintained by MongoDB. 

You can also create your own snippets, package them for easier
management, and configure a registry to share them.

- **Try an Existing Snippet**.

  :ref:`Install <snip-install-packages>` and :ref:`run <snip-run-snippets>`
  a snippet package from the `community registry
  <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongosh-snippets/tree/main/snippets>`__
- **Create Your Own Snippet Package**.

  :ref:`Write <snip-write>` the snippet code and supporting files. Then,
  :ref:`publish <snip-publish>` the snippet package.
- **Configure Snippet Registries**.

  Use the `community registry
  <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongosh-snippets/tree/main/snippets>`__
  or :ref:`configure <snip-registry-config>` a private registry.
