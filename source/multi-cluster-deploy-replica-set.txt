Use this procedure to create a new replica set in a member |k8s| cluster in a
|multi-cluster|.

This procedure allows you to set different settings for the replica set
resource, such as overrides for statefulSet configuration. As an
alternative to using this procedure, you can use the
:ref:`multi-cluster-quick-start-ref`, which creates a
|multi-cluster| with default settings.

Before you begin:

- Learn about :ref:`multi-Kubernetes-cluster deployments <multi-cluster-overview-ref>`.
- Review the list of :ref:`multi-Kubernetes-cluster services and tools <multi-cluster-services-tools-ref>`.
- Install the |k8s-op-short| in a |multi-cluster|. See :ref:`multi-cluster-quick-start-ref`.
- Complete the :ref:`prerequisites <multi-cluster-prereqs>`.
- Deploy |onprem| resource on the central cluster. See :ref:`multi-cluster-deploy-om-summary`.

Deploy a ``MongoDBMultiCluster`` Resource

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: With TLS-Encrypted Connections
      :tabid: encrypted-rs

      You can use the following procedures in this
      :guilabel:`TLS-Encrypted Connections` tab:

      - Deploy a |mongodb-multi|
      - Renew TLS Certificates for a |mongodb-multi|

      These procedures establish |tls|-encrypted connections between
      MongoDB hosts in a replica set, and between client applications and
      MongoDB deployments.
  
      Before you begin, you must have valid certificates for |tls| encryption.

      Renew TLS Certificates for a ``MongoDBMultiCluster`` Resource
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Renew your |tls| certificates periodically using the following procedure.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-k8s-multi-cluster-rs-tls-custom-renew.rst

   .. tab:: With Non-Encrypted Connections
      :tabid: non-encrypted-rs

      This procedure doesn't encrypt connections between MongoDB hosts in
      a replica set, and between client applications and MongoDB deployments.
