.. _spark-streaming-input-conf:

Overview
--------

You can configure the following properties when reading data from MongoDB in streaming mode.

.. include:: /includes/conf-read-prefix.rst

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - Property name
     - Description
   
   * - ``connection.uri``
     - | **Required.**
       | The connection string configuration key.
       |
       | **Default:** ``mongodb://localhost:27017/``

   * - ``database``
     - | **Required.**
       | The database name configuration.

   * - ``collection``
     - | **Required.**
       | The collection name configuration.
       | You can specify multiple collections by separating the collection names
         with a comma.
       |
       | To learn more about specifying multiple collections, see :ref:`spark-specify-multiple-collections`.
   
   * - ``comment``
     - | The comment to append to the read operation. Comments appear in the 
         :manual:`output of the Database Profiler. </reference/database-profiler>`
       |
       | **Default:** None 

   * - ``mode``
     - | The parsing strategy to use when handling documents that don't match the
         expected schema. This option accepts the following values:

       - ``ReadConfig.ParseMode.FAILFAST``: Throws an exception when parsing a document that
         doesn't match the schema.
       - ``ReadConfig.ParseMode.PERMISSIVE``: Sets fields to ``null`` when data types don't match
         the schema. To store each invalid document as an extended JSON string,
         combine this value with the ``columnNameOfCorruptRecord`` option.
       - ``ReadConfig.ParseMode.DROPMALFORMED``: Ignores any document that doesn't match
         the schema.

       |
       | **Default:** ``ReadConfig.ParseMode.FAILFAST``
 
   * - ``columnNameOfCorruptRecord``
     - | If you set the ``mode`` option to ``ReadConfig.ParseMode.PERMISSIVE``,
         this option specifies the name of the new column that stores the invalid
         document as extended JSON. If you're using an explicit schema, it must
         include the name of the new column. If you're
         using an inferred schema, the {+connector-short+} adds the new column to the
         end of the schema. 
       |
       | **Default:** None 
  
   * - ``mongoClientFactory``
     - | MongoClientFactory configuration key.
       | You can specify a custom implementation, which must implement the
         ``com.mongodb.spark.sql.connector.connection.MongoClientFactory``
         interface.
       |
       | **Default:** ``com.mongodb.spark.sql.connector.connection.DefaultMongoClientFactory``

   * - ``aggregation.pipeline``
     - | Specifies a custom aggregation pipeline to apply to the collection
         before sending data to Spark.
       | The value must be either an extended JSON single document or list
         of documents.
       | A single document resembles the following:

       .. code-block:: json

          {"$match": {"closed": false}}

       | A list of documents resembles the following:

       .. code-block:: json

          [{"$match": {"closed": false}}, {"$project": {"status": 1, "name": 1, "description": 1}}]

       Custom aggregation pipelines must be compatible with the
       partitioner strategy. For example, aggregation stages such as
       ``$group`` do not work with any partitioner that creates more than
       one partition.

   * - ``aggregation.allowDiskUse``
     - | Specifies whether to allow storage to disk when running the
         aggregation.
       |
       | **Default:** ``true``

   * - ``change.stream.``
     - | Change stream configuration prefix.
       | See the
         :ref:`Change Stream Configuration <change-stream-conf>` section for more
         information about change streams.

   * - ``outputExtendedJson``
     - | When ``true``, the connector converts BSON types not supported by Spark into 
         extended JSON strings.
         When ``false``, the connector uses the original relaxed JSON format for 
         unsupported types.
       |
       | **Default:** ``false``

   * - ``schemaHint``
     - | Specifies a partial schema of known field types to use when inferring
         the schema for the collection. To learn more about the ``schemaHint``
         option, see the :ref:`spark-schema-hint` section.
       |
       | **Default:** None

.. _change-stream-conf:

Change Stream Configuration
---------------------------

You can configure the following properties when reading a change stream from MongoDB:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 65

   * - Property name
     - Description

   * - ``change.stream.lookup.full.document``

     - Determines what values your change stream returns on update
       operations.

       The default setting returns the differences between the original
       document and the updated document.

       The ``updateLookup`` setting also returns the differences between the
       original document and updated document, but it also includes a copy of the
       entire updated document.

       For more information on how this change stream option works,
       see the MongoDB server manual guide
       :manual:`Lookup Full Document for Update Operation </changeStreams/#lookup-full-document-for-update-operations>`.
       
       **Default:** "default"

   * - ``change.stream.micro.batch.max.partition.count``
     - | The maximum number of partitions the {+connector-short+} divides each 
         micro-batch into. Spark workers can process these partitions in parallel.
       |  
       | This setting applies only when using micro-batch streams.
       |
       | **Default**: ``1``

       :red:`WARNING:` Specifying a value larger than ``1`` can alter the order in which
       the {+connector-short+} processes change events. Avoid this setting
       if out-of-order processing could create data inconsistencies downstream. 

   * - ``change.stream.publish.full.document.only``
     - | Specifies whether to publish the changed document or the full
         change stream document.
       |
       | When this setting is ``false``, you must specify a schema. The schema
         must include all fields that you want to read from the change stream. You can
         use optional fields to ensure that the schema is valid for all change-stream
         events.
       |
       | When this setting is ``true``, the connector exhibits the following behavior:
       
       - The connector filters out messages that
         omit the ``fullDocument`` field and publishes only the value of the
         field.
       - If you don't specify a schema, the connector infers the schema
         from the change stream document.

       This setting overrides the ``change.stream.lookup.full.document``
       setting.
       
       **Default**: ``false``

   * - ``change.stream.startup.mode``
     - | Specifies how the connector starts up when no offset is available.
       
       | This setting accepts the following values:
        
       - ``latest``: The connector begins processing
         change events starting with the most recent event.
         It will not process any earlier unprocessed events.
       - ``timestamp``: The connector begins processing change events at a specified time.
           
         To use the ``timestamp`` option, you must specify a time by using the
         ``change.stream.startup.mode.timestamp.start.at.operation.time`` setting.
         This setting accepts timestamps in the following formats:
         
         - An integer representing the number of seconds since the
           :wikipedia:`Unix epoch <Unix_time>`
         - A date and time in
           `ISO-8601 <https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html>`__
           format with one-second precision
         - An extended JSON ``BsonTimestamp``
       
         **Default**: ``latest``
 
Specifying Properties in ``connection.uri``
-------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/connection-read-config.rst

.. _spark-specify-multiple-collections:

Specifying Multiple Collections in the ``collection`` Property
--------------------------------------------------------------

You can specify multiple collections in the ``collection`` change stream
configuration property by separating the collection names
with a comma. Do not add a space between the collections unless the space is a
part of the collection name.

Specify multiple collections as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: java

   ...
   .option("spark.mongodb.collection", "collectionOne,collectionTwo")

If a collection name is "*", or if the name includes a comma or a backslash (\\),
you must escape the character as follows:

- If the name of a collection used in your ``collection`` configuration
  option contains a comma, the {+connector-short+} treats it as two different
  collections. To avoid this, you must escape the comma by preceding it with
  a backslash (\\). Escape a collection named "my,collection" as follows:

  .. code-block:: java

     "my\,collection"

- If the name of a collection used in your ``collection`` configuration
  option is "*", the {+connector-short+} interprets it as a specification
  to scan all collections. To avoid this, you must escape the asterisk by preceding it
  with a backslash (\\). Escape a collection named "*" as follows:

  .. code-block:: java

     "\*"

- If the name of a collection used in your ``collection`` configuration
  option contains a backslash (\\), the
  {+connector-short+} treats the backslash as an escape character, which
  might change how it interprets the value. To avoid this, you must escape
  the backslash by preceding it with another backslash. Escape a collection named "\\collection" as follows:

  .. code-block:: java

     "\\collection"
  
  .. note:: 
     
     When specifying the collection name as a string literal in Java, you must
     further escape each backslash with another one. For example, escape a collection 
     named "\\collection" as follows:

     .. code-block:: java

        "\\\\collection"

You can stream from all collections in the database by passing an
asterisk (*) as a string for the collection name.

Specify all collections as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: java

   ...
   .option("spark.mongodb.collection", "*")

If you create a collection while streaming from all collections, the new
collection is automatically included in the stream. 

You can drop collections at any time while streaming from multiple collections.

.. important:: Inferring the Schema with Multiple Collections

   If you set the ``change.stream.publish.full.document.only``
   option to ``true``, the {+connector-short+} infers the schema of a ``DataFrame``
   by using the schema of the scanned documents. 
   
   Schema inference happens at the beginning of streaming, and does not take
   into account collections that are created during streaming.

   When streaming from multiple collections and inferring the schema, the connector samples
   each collection sequentially. Streaming from a large number of
   collections can cause the schema inference to have noticeably slower
   performance. This performance impact occurs only while inferring the schema.
