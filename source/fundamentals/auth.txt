Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to authenticate with MongoDB using each
**authentication mechanism** available in the MongoDB Community Edition.
Authentication mechanisms are processes by which the driver and MongoDB deployment
confirm identity and establish trust to ensure security.

The mechanisms that you can use with the latest version of MongoDB Community
Edition are as follows:

- :ref:`Default <default-auth-mechanism>`
- :ref:`SCRAM-SHA-256 <scram-sha-256-auth-mechanism>`
- :ref:`SCRAM-SHA-1 <scram-sha-1-auth-mechanism>`
- :ref:`MONGODB-CR <mongodb-cr-auth-mechanism>`
- :ref:`MONGODB-AWS <mongodb-aws-auth-mechanism>`
- :ref:`X.509 <x509-auth-mechanism>`

To authenticate using ``Kerberos`` or ``LDAP``, see the
:doc:`Enterprise Authentication Mechanisms guide </fundamentals/enterprise-auth>`.
For more information about establishing a connection to your MongoDB cluster,
read our :doc:`Connection Guide </fundamentals/connection>`.

Mechanisms
----------

.. _default-auth-mechanism:

Default
~~~~~~~

The default authentication mechanism setting uses one of the following
authentication mechanisms depending on what your version of {+mdb-server+} 
supports:

#. ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
#. ``SCRAM-SHA-1``
#. ``MONGODB-CR``

Server versions 3.6 and earlier use ``MONGODB-CR`` as the default
mechanism. Newer versions of {+mdb-server+} use one of the mechanisms for
which they advertise support.

The following code snippets show how to specify the authentication mechanism,
using the following placeholders:

- ``username``: your MongoDB username
- ``password``: your MongoDB user's password
- ``hostname``: network address of your MongoDB deployment that your
  client can access
- ``port``: port number of your MongoDB deployment
- ``authenticationDb``: MongoDB database that contains your user's
  authentication data

.. note::

   If you omit the ``authenticationDb`` parameter, the driver uses the
   default ``admin`` database.

Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or the :guilabel:`MongoCredential`
tab below for instructions and sample code for specifying this authentication
mechanism:

.. _mongo-client-setting-with-mongo-credential-example:

.. tabs::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: Connection String

      To specify the default authentication mechanism using a connection
      string, omit the mechanism. The code to instantiate a ``MongoClient``
      resembles the following:

      .. code-block:: java

         MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>/?authSource=<authenticationDb>");

   .. tab::
      :tabid: MongoCredential

      To specify the default authentication mechanism using the
      ``MongoCredential`` class, use the ``createCredential()`` method. The
      code to instantiate a ``MongoClient`` resembles the following:

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/auth-credentials-default.rst

For more information about the challenge-response (CR) and salted
challenge-response authentication mechanisms (SCRAM) that MongoDB supports,
see the :manual:`SCRAM </core/security-scram/>` section of the {+mdb-server+}
manual.

.. _scram-sha-256-auth-mechanism:

``SCRAM-SHA-256``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` is the default authentication method for MongoDB starting
   in MongoDB 4.0.

``SCRAM-SHA-256`` is a salted challenge-response authentication mechanism
(SCRAM) that uses your username and password, encrypted with the ``SHA-256``
algorithm, to authenticate your user.

The following code snippets show how to specify the authentication mechanism,
using the following placeholders:

- ``username``: your MongoDB username
- ``password``: your MongoDB user's password
- ``hostname``: network address of your MongoDB deployment that your
  client can access
- ``port``: port number of your MongoDB deployment
- ``authenticationDb``: MongoDB database that contains your user's
  authentication data

.. note::

   If you omit the ``authenticationDb`` parameter, the driver uses the
   default ``admin`` database.

Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or the :guilabel:`MongoCredential`
tab below for instructions and sample code for specifying this authentication
mechanism:

.. tabs::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: Connection String

      To specify the ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` authentication mechanism using a
      connection string, assign the ``authMechanism`` parameter the value
      ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` in your connection string. The code to instantiate
      a ``MongoClient`` resembles the following:

      .. code-block:: java

         MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>/?authSource=<authenticationDb>&authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256");

   .. tab::
      :tabid: MongoCredential

      To specify the default authentication mechanism using the
      ``MongoCredential`` class, use the
      `createScramSha256Credential() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoCredential.html#createScramSha256Credential(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,char[])>`__
      method. The code to instantiate a ``MongoClient`` resembles
      the following:

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/auth-credentials-sha256.rst

.. _scram-sha-1-auth-mechanism:

``SCRAM-SHA-1``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is the default authentication method for MongoDB versions
   3.0, 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6.

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is a salted challenge-response mechanism (SCRAM) that uses your
username and password, encrypted with the ``SHA-1`` algorithm, to authenticate
your user.

The following code snippets show how to specify the authentication mechanism,
using the following placeholders:

- ``username``: your MongoDB username
- ``password``: your MongoDB user's password
- ``hostname``: network address of your MongoDB deployment that your
  client can access
- ``port``: port number of your MongoDB deployment
- ``authenticationDb``: MongoDB database that contains your user's
  authentication data

.. note::

   If you omit the ``authenticationDb`` parameter, the driver uses the
   default ``admin`` database.

Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or the :guilabel:`MongoCredential`
tab below for instructions and sample code for specifying this authentication
mechanism:

.. tabs::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: Connection String

      To specify the ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` authentication mechanism using a
      connection string, assign the ``authMechanism`` parameter the value
      ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` in your connection string. The code to instantiate
      a ``MongoClient`` resembles the following:

      .. code-block:: java

         MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>/?authSource=<authenticationDb>&authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1");

   .. tab::
      :tabid: MongoCredential

      To specify the default authentication mechanism using the
      ``MongoCredential`` class, use the
      `createScramSha1Credential() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoCredential.html#createScramSha1Credential(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,char[])>`__
      method. The code to instantiate a ``MongoClient`` resembles the following:

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/auth-credentials-sha1.rst

.. _mongodb-cr-auth-mechanism:

``MONGODB-CR``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``MONGODB-CR`` is a challenge-response authentication mechanism that uses your
username and password to authenticate your user. This authentication
mechanism was deprecated starting in MongoDB 3.6 and is no longer
supported as of MongoDB 4.0.

You cannot specify this method explicitly; refer to the fallback provided
by the :ref:`default authentication mechanism <default-auth-mechanism>` to
connect using ``MONGODB-CR``.

.. _mongodb-aws-auth-mechanism:

``MONGODB-AWS``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..
   The MONGODB-AWS section structure was updated for v4.8 of the driver. Avoid
   backporting any documentation that might not apply to a prior version.

.. note::

   The MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism is available for MongoDB
   deployments on MongoDB Atlas.

The ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism uses your Amazon Web Services
Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) credentials to authenticate your
user. To learn more about configuring MongoDB Atlas, see the
:atlas:`Set Up Passwordless Authentication with AWS IAM Roles </security/passwordless-authentication/#set-up-passwordless-authentication-with-aws-iam-roles>`
guide.

To instruct the driver to use this authentication mechanism, you can specify
``MONGODB-AWS`` either as a parameter in the connection string or by using
the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method.

Learn how to specify this authentication mechanism and the various ways to
provide your AWS IAM credentials in the next sections.

These sections contain code examples that use the following placeholders:

- ``awsKeyId``: value of your AWS access key ID
- ``awsSecretKey``: value of your AWS secret access key
- ``atlasUri``: network address of your MongoDB Atlas deployment
- ``hostname``: hostname of your MongoDB Atlas deployment
- ``port``: port of your MongoDB Atlas deployment
- ``awsSessionToken``: value of your AWS session token

.. _java-mongodb-aws-sdk:

AWS SDK for Java
++++++++++++++++

.. versionadded:: v4.8

You can use one of the AWS SDK for Java v1 or v2 to specify your credentials.
This method offers the following features:

- Multiple options for obtaining credentials
- Credential caching which helps your application avoid rate limiting
- Credential provider management for use with the `Elastic Kubernetes Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html>`__.

To use the AWS SDK for Java for ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication, you must
perform the following:

1. Specify the authentication mechanism
#. Add the SDK as a dependency to your project
#. Supply your credentials using one of the methods in the credential
   provider chain

.. important::

   This method of providing ``MONGODB-AWS`` credentials is available
   only in the {+driver-long+} v4.8 and later.

To specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential``,
use the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method
and add the ``MongoCredential`` instance to your ``MongoClient`` as shown
in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start mechOnlyMongoCredential
   :end-before: end mechOnlyMongoCredential
   :emphasize-lines: 1,7

To specify the authentication mechanism in the connection string, add
it as a parameter as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start mechOnlyConnectionString
   :end-before: end mechOnlyConnectionString

To add the AWS SDK as a dependency to your project, see the following
AWS documentation for the version you need:

- For the **AWS SDK for Java v2**, see the `Setting Up <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/setup.html>`__
  guide.
- For the **AWS SDK for Java v1**, see the `Getting Started <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/getting-started.html>`__
  guide.

.. note::

   For the AWS SDK for Java v2, the Java driver currently tests using the
   ``software.amazon.awssdk:auth:2.18.9`` dependency.

   For the AWS SDK for Java v1, the Java driver currently tests using the
   ``com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-core:1.12.337`` dependency.

To supply your credentials, see the following AWS documentation for the
version you need:

- To learn more about the **AWS SDK for Java v2** class the driver uses to
  get the credentials, see the `DefaultCredentialsProvider <https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/auth/credentials/DefaultCredentialsProvider.html>`__
  API documentation.

  Learn how to supply your credentials to this class from the
  `Use the default credential provider chain <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-chain>`__
  section.

- To learn more about the **AWS SDK for Java v1** class the driver uses to
  get the credentials, see the `DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.html>`__
  API documentation.

  Learn how to supply your credentials to this class from the
  `Using the Default Credential Provider Chain <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default>`__
  section.

.. note::

   If you include both v1 and v2 of the AWS SDK for Java in your project,
   you must use the v2 methods to supply your credentials.

.. _java-mongodb-aws-env-variables:

Specify Your Credentials in the Environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can provide your AWS IAM credentials by instructing the driver to
use the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism and by setting the
appropriate environment variables.

To use the environment variables to supply your credentials, you must perform
the following:

1. Specify the authentication mechanism
#. Add the appropriate environment variables

You can specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential``
or on the connection string.

To specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential``,
use the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method and add the
``MongoCredential`` instance to your ``MongoClient`` as shown in the following
example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start mechOnlyMongoCredential
   :end-before: end mechOnlyMongoCredential
   :emphasize-lines: 1,7

To specify the authentication mechanism in the connection string, add it as a
parameter as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start mechOnlyConnectionString
   :end-before: end mechOnlyConnectionString

The next examples show how to provide your credentials by setting environment
variables for the following types of authentication:

- Programmatic access keys
- Web identity provider
- ECS container credentials
- EC2 container credentials

The following example shows how you can set your **programmatic access keys**
in environment variables by using ``bash`` or a similar shell:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<awsKeyId>
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<awsSecretKey>
   export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<awsSessionToken>

Omit the line containing ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` if you don't need an AWS
session token for that role.

You can use an OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible **web identity provider** to authenticate
to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or other services.

.. important::

   Your project must include v1 or v2 of the AWS SDK as a dependency to authenticate 
   using a web identity provider.

To use a web identity provider, create a file that contains your
OIDC token. Next, use ``bash`` or a similar shell to set an environment variable
to the absolute path to this file, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE=<absolute path to file containing your OIDC token>

To authenticate by using **ECS container credentials**, set the ECS
endpoint relative URI in an environment variable by using ``bash`` or
a similar shell as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: bash

   export AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI=<your ECS endpoint>

To authenticate by using **EC2 container credentials**, make sure none of the
environment variables mentioned in this section are set. The driver obtains the
credentials from the default IPv4 EC2 instance metadata endpoint instead
of from environment variables.

.. _java-mongodb-aws-mongoclient-configuration:

Specify Your Credentials in a MongoCredential
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can supply your AWS IAM credentials to a ``MongoClient`` by using a
``MongoCredential`` instance. To construct the ``MongoCredential`` instance
for ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication,  use the `createAwsCredential() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoCredential.html#createAwsCredential(java.lang.String,char%5B%5D)>`__
factory method.

You can supply only programmatic access keys to the
``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` method. If you must supply ECS
or EC2 container credentials, use the instructions in
:ref:`<java-mongodb-aws-env-variables>` or :ref:`<java-mongodb-aws-sdk>`.

To use the ``MongoCredential`` for ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication, you
must perform the following:

1. Specify the authentication mechanism
#. Supply the credentials

To specify the authentication mechanism by using a ``MongoCredential``,
use the ``MongoCredential.createAwsCredential()`` factory method
and add the ``MongoCredential`` instance to your ``MongoClient`` as shown
in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start mongoCredential
   :end-before: end mongoCredential
   :emphasize-lines: 1

If you must specify an AWS session token, pass it to the
`withMechanismProperty() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoCredential.html#withMechanismProperty(java.lang.String,T)>`__
method as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start mongoCredentialSessionTokenCredential
   :end-before: end mongoCredentialSessionTokenCredential
   :emphasize-lines: 1,7

To refresh your credentials, you can declare a ``Supplier`` lambda expression
that returns new credentials as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MongoDbAwsAuth.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start refreshCredentials
   :end-before: end refreshCredentials
   :emphasize-lines: 4-5,8-9

.. note::

   If you must provide AWS IAM credentials in a connection string, refer to
   a previous release of the `MONGODB-AWS driver documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/java/sync/v4.7/fundamentals/auth/#mongodb-aws>`__.

.. _x509-auth-mechanism:

``X.509``
~~~~~~~~~

The ``X.509`` authentication mechanism uses
:wikipedia:`TLS <Transport_Layer_Security>` with X.509 certificates to
authenticate your user, identified by the relative distinguished names
(RDNs) of your client certificate. When you specify the ``X.509``
authentication mechanism, the server authenticates the connection using
the subject name of the client certificate.

The following code snippets show how to specify the authentication mechanism,
using the following placeholders:

- ``hostname``: network address of your MongoDB deployment that your
  client can access
- ``port``: port number of your MongoDB deployment
- ``authenticationDb``: MongoDB database that contains your user's
  authentication data

.. note::

   If you omit the ``authenticationDb`` parameter, the driver uses the
   default ``admin`` database.

Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or the :guilabel:`MongoCredential`
tab below for instructions and sample code for specifying this authentication
mechanism:

.. tabs::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: Connection String

      To specify the ``X.509`` authentication mechanism using a connection
      string, assign the ``authMechanism`` parameter the value ``MONGODB-X509``
      and enable TLS by assigning the ``tls``
      parameter a ``true`` value. The code to instantiate a ``MongoClient``
      resembles the following:

      .. code-block:: java

         MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create("mongodb://<hostname>:<port>/?authSource=<authenticationDb>&authMechanism=MONGODB-X509&tls=true");

   .. tab::
      :tabid: MongoCredential

      To specify the ``X.509`` authentication mechanism using the
      ``MongoCredential`` class, use the
      `createMongoX509Credential() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoCredential.html#createMongoX509Credential(java.lang.String)>`__
      method. Also, enable TLS by calling the
      `applyToSslSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToSslSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
      method and setting the ``enabled`` property to ``true`` in the
      `SslSettings.Builder <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/connection/SslSettings.Builder.html>`__
      block. The code to instantiate a ``MongoClient`` resembles
      the following:

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/auth-credentials-x509.rst

For additional information on configuring your application to use
certificates as well as TLS/SSL options, see our
:doc:`TLS/SSL guide </fundamentals/connection/tls>`.
