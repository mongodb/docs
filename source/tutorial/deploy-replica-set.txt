====================
Deploy a Replica Set
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MMS can deploy and manage MongoDB :term:`replica set`
deployments. Replica sets are MongoDB autonomous data replication
feature that provides high availability and redundancy, and are the
basis of all production MongoDB deployments.  See the
:manual:`Replication Introduction </core/replication-introduction>` for
more information about replica sets.

Use this procedure to deploy a new replica set managed by
MMS. Later, you can use MMS to add or remove members of the set and
perform other maintenance on the deployment.
