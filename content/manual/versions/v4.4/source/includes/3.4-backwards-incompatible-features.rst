The following 3.4 features persist data that earlier MongoDB versions
cannot correctly handle and require that
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` be set to ``"3.4"``:

- :ref:`3.4-relnotes-views`

- :ref:`3.4-relnotes-collation`

- :ref:`3.4-decimal`

- Index version ``v: 2``. ``v:2`` indexes add support for collation and
  decimal data type. Earlier index versions support neither collation
  nor the decimal data type.

  If ``featureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4"``, indexes created in MongoDB
  3.4 default to ``v: 2`` . Otherwise, new indexes default to ``v: 1``.
