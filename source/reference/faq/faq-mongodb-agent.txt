-------

.. _mongodb-agent-faq-general-what-is-it:

What is the MongoDB Agent?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+mdbagent+} helps you manage, monitor, and back up your MongoDB 
instances.

.. _mongodb-agent-faq-general-when-is-the-launch:

When was the MongoDB Agent in |mms| launched?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+mdbagent+} was released for |onprem| 4.1 on 29 May 2019. 
MongoDB requires you to update as soon as possible to the {+mdbagent+} because the legacy Agents are now EOL. 


When must I switch to the MongoDB Agent?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now. Any legacy agent update requires switching to the {+mdbagent+}.
You must update all clusters in the project. Once updated, the
|mms| console renders the new interface for the {+mdbagent+}.

Can I update per cluster or per node?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. Updates to {+mdbagent+} must be done for all clusters in a project
simultaneously.

Did the |mms| UI change?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. The Agent(s) and Servers tabs were updated to reflect this change.

Does the |mms| API support the MongoDB Agent?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes.

Can I programmatically upgrade to MongoDB Agent via the API?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes.

Does the new installer use a different filename?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. The name for the installer is ``mms-automation`` to make the update
easier.

I have a PEM Key File and Password(s) set for my legacy Automation, Monitoring or Backup Agents? What should I know when I switch to the {+mdbagent+}?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you switch to using the {+mdbagent+}, these settings are preserved.
If you previously set a |pem| Key File and Password in the :guilabel:`Security` >
:guilabel:`Settings` section of |mms|, |mms| uses the current Automation
Agent's |pem| key file and Password as the {+mdbagent+} |pem| Key File
and Password.

Any existing Monitoring and Backup |pem| Key File and password(s) are
exported into the new custom configuration section for :guilabel:`Monitoring and
Backup` on the {+mdbagent+} UI page. A warning displays in the
:guilabel:`Configure Cloud Manager Agents` section
(:guilabel:`Security` > :guilabel:`Settings`)
that the values from the custom configuration section override these values.

.. _mongodb-agent-faq-monitoring-agent-only:

I only use the legacy Monitoring Agent, what does this mean for me?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The {+mdbagent+} provides support in this case. The process of switching
to using the {+mdbagent+} proceeds as follows:

#. When the {+mdbagent+} is available, you see the banner
   notification that your Monitoring Agent is out of date.

#. When you are ready to switch, click :guilabel:`Update` in the
   banner. A workflow that guides you through the update process
   starts.

   a. Read a {+mdbagent+} description with a link to documentation.

   #. Specify custom Monitoring configuration options that you use for
      your |mms| project.

   #. Download and install the {+mdbagent+}. |mms| verifies that the
      {+mdbagent+} is installed correctly on the list of specified servers.

      .. note::

         Previously configured  authentication methods continue to work.
         You provide the MongoDB authentication information in
         :guilabel:`Monitoring Settings` uder the :icon:`ellipsis-h` menu.

#. Once you install the {+mdbagent+} on a server, the {+mdbagent+} enables
   the Monitoring for projects where Monitoring  existed as a
   standalone Agent before switching to the{+mdbagent+}.

#. The {+mdbagent+} puts the previously used  Monitoring Agents into
   standby mode and no longer shows them in the UI.

#. The previously used standalone Monitoring Agents can no longer monitor
   instances. You can stop and remove them when ready.

From this point forward, the {+mdbagent+} updates itself after you
choose the :guilabel:`Confirm and Deploy` option for the new version.
You no longer need to download the {+mdbagent+} each time a new version
becomes available!

.. _mongodb-agent-faq-monitoring-and-backup-agents-only:

I only use the legacy Monitoring and Backup Agents, what does this mean for me?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The {+mdbagent+} supports this use case. The flow for switching to the
{+mdbagent+} proceeds as follows:

#. When the {+mdbagent+} is available, you see the banner
   notification that your Monitoring and Backup Agents are out of date.

#. When you are ready to update, click :guilabel:`Update` in the
   banner. A workflow that guides you through the update process
   starts.

   a. Read {+mdbagent+} description with a link to documentation.

   #. Specify custom Monitoring and Backup configuration options that you
      use for your |mms| project.

   #. Download and install the {+mdbagent+}. |mms|
      verifies that the {+mdbagent+} been installed correctly on the
      list of known servers.

      .. note::

         Previous authentication methods continue to work. You provide
         MongoDB authentication information in :guilabel:`Monitoring Settings`
         under the :icon:`ellipsis-h` menu. To specify Backup user
         settings, go to :guilabel:`Backup` under :guilabel:`Options` >
         :icon:`ellipsis-h` > :guilabel:`Edit Credentials`.

#. Once the {+mdbagent+} is installed on a server, it enables the
   Monitoring and Backup in projects where the Agents were previously
   configured.

#. The {+mdbagent+} puts the previously used  Monitoring and Backup Agents
   into standby mode and no longer shows them in the UI. The previously
   used standalone Monitoring Agents can no longer monitor instances.
   You can stop and remove them when ready.

From this point forward, the {+mdbagent+} updates itself if you choose
to use the :guilabel:`Confirm and Deploy` option for a new version. You
no longer need to download the {+mdbagent+} each time a new version
becomes available!

.. _mongodb-agent-faq-three-agents:

My clusters are already managed using all 3 legacy Agents, what will happen?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The update flow proceeds as follows:

#. When the {+mdbagent+} is available, you see the banner
   notification that your legacy Agents are out of date.

#. When you are ready to update, click :guilabel:`Update` in the
   banner. A workflow that guides you through the update process
   starts.

   #. Read the {+mdbagent+} description with link to documentation.

   #. Review  a list of your current servers and update them to the
      {+mdbagent+}. As a part of this update process the {+mdbagent+}:

      - Stops any legacy Monitoring and Backup Agents.

      - Enables Monitoring and Backup on the servers where Monitoring
        and  Backup were running as Agents.

      - Removes the binaries for the stopped Monitoring and Backup Agents.

      - Unlocks the ``mms-monitoring-agent`` or ``mms-backup-agent``
        users in your MongoDB instances so you can delete them, if
        desired. The {+mdbagent+} uses the ``mms-automation`` user to
        connect to your instances.

From this point forward, the {+mdbagent+} works as a single process for
Automation, Monitoring, and Backup.

What about the three MongoDB Agent Users?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB consolidated the three MongoDB users that the legacy Automation
Agent used (``mms-automation``, ``mms-monitoring-agent``,
``mms-backup-agent``) into one user. This user, ``mms-automation``, can 
automate, monitor, and back up instances. MongoDB didn't remove the previous
MongoDB users in case you use those users in other projects. However, 
|mms| unlocked these users in its interface as part of the update so that 
you may delete them.

I mostly manage my clusters with the Automation Agent but I have a
Standalone legacy Backup and Monitoring Agents, what does this mean for me?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You get both update flows: one for any standalone Agent, as described in
the previous sections:

:ref:`I only use the legacy Monitoring Agent, what does this mean for me? <mongodb-agent-faq-monitoring-agent-only>` or

:ref:`I only use the legacy Monitoring and Backup Agents, what does this mean for me? <mongodb-agent-faq-monitoring-and-backup-agents-only>`

For those servers where Automation manages legacy Monitoring and Backup Agents,
see 
:ref:`My clusters are already managed using all 3 Agents, what will happen? <mongodb-agent-faq-three-agents>`.
