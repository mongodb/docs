.. expression:: $dateDiff

   .. versionadded:: 5.0

   Returns the difference between two dates. 

   The :expression:`$dateDiff` expression has this syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { 
         $dateDiff: { 
            startDate: <Expression>, 
            endDate: <Expression>, 
            unit: <Expression>, 
            timezone: <tzExpression>,
            startOfWeek: <String> 
         }
      } 

   Subtracts ``startDate`` from ``endDate``. Returns an integer in the
   specified ``unit``.

      * - Field
        - Required/Optional
        - Description

      * - ``startDate``
        - Required
        - The start of the time period. The ``startDate`` can be any
          :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` that resolves to
          a :ref:`Date <document-bson-type-date>`, a
          :ref:`Timestamp <document-bson-type-timestamp>`,
          or an :ref:`ObjectID <document-bson-type-object-id>`.

      * - ``endDate``
        - Required
        - The end of the time period. The ``endDate`` can be any
          :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` that resolves to
          a :ref:`Date <document-bson-type-date>`, a
          :ref:`Timestamp <document-bson-type-timestamp>`,
          or an :ref:`ObjectID <document-bson-type-object-id>`.

      * - ``unit``
        - Required
        - The time measurement ``unit`` between the ``startDate`` and
          ``endDate``. It is an 
          :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` that resolves to
          a string:

          - ``year`` 
          - ``quarter``
          - ``week``
          - ``month``
          - ``day``
          - ``hour``
          - ``minute``
          - ``second``
          - ``millisecond``

      * - ``timezone``
        - Optional
        - .. include:: /includes/fact-timezone-description-no-option.rst

      * - ``startOfWeek``
        - Optional
        - Used when the unit is equal to ``week``. Defaults to
          ``Sunday``. The ``startOfWeek`` parameter is an
          :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` that resolves
          to a case insensitive string:

          - ``monday`` (or ``mon``)
          - ``tuesday`` (or ``tue``)
          - ``wednesday`` (or ``wed``)
          - ``thursday`` (or ``thu``)
          - ``friday`` (or ``fri``)
          - ``saturday`` (or ``sat``)
          - ``sunday`` (or ``sun``)

Behavior
--------

No Fractional Units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``$dateDiff`` expression returns the integer difference between the
``startDate`` and ``endDate`` measured in the specified ``units``.
Durations are measured by counting the number of times a unit boundary
is passed. For example, two dates that are 18 months apart would
return 1 ``year`` difference instead of 1.5 ``years``.

Start Of Week
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The start of the ``week`` is ``Sunday`` unless modified by the
``startOfWeek`` parameter. Any week that begins between the 
``startDate`` and ``endDate`` on the specified day will be counted. The
week count is not bounded by calendar ``month`` or calendar ``year``.

Time Zone
~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-olson-tz-behavior.rst

Additional Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The algorithm calculates the date difference using the Gregorian
calendar. 

Leap years and daylight savings time are accounted for but not leap
seconds.

The difference returned can be negative.   

Examples
--------

Elapsed Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a collection of customer orders:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.insertMany(
      [
         { 
            custId: 456, 
            purchased: ISODate("2020-12-31"), 
            delivered: ISODate("2021-01-05")
         },
         { 
            custId: 457, 
            purchased: ISODate("2021-02-28"), 
            delivered: ISODate("2021-03-07")
         },
         { 
            custId: 458, 
            purchased: ISODate("2021-02-16"), 
            delivered: ISODate("2021-02-18")
         }
      ]
   )
 

The following example:

- Returns the average number of days for a delivery.
- Uses ``dateDiff`` to calculate the difference between the
  ``purchased`` date and the ``delivered`` date.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 11-16

    db.orders.aggregate(
       [
          { 
             $group: 
                { 
                    _id: null, 
                    averageTime: 
                       { 
                          $avg:
                             { 
                                $dateDiff: 
                                   { 
                                       startDate: "$purchased",
                                       endDate: "$delivered",
                                       unit: "day"
                                   } 
                              }
                       }
                }
          },
          {
             $project:
                { 
                   _id: 0,
                   numDays: 
                      { 
                         $trunc: 
                            [ "$averageTime", 1 ]
                      }
                }
           }
       ]
   )

The :group:`$avg` accumulator in the :pipeline:`$group` stage uses
``$dateDiff`` on each document to get the time between the
``purchased`` and ``delivered`` dates. The resulting value is returned
as ``averageTime``.

The decimal portion of the ``averageTime`` is truncated
(:expression:`$trunc`) in the :pipeline:`$project` stage to produce
output like this:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "numDays" : 4.6 }

Result Precision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create this collection with starting and ending dates for a
subscription. 

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.subscriptions.insertMany(
      [
         { 
            custId: 456,
            start: ISODate("2010-01-01"),
            end: ISODate("2011-01-01")
         },
         {
            custId: 457,
            start: ISODate("2010-01-01"),
            end: ISODate("2011-06-31")
         },
         {
            custId: 458, 
            start: ISODate("2010-03-01"),
            end: ISODate("2010-04-30")
         }
      ]
   )

The ``$dateDiff`` expression returns a time difference expressed in
integer ``units``. There are no fractional parts of a unit. For
example, when counting in ``years`` there are no half years. 

In this example, note how changing the ``unit`` changes the returned
precision: 

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 10-14, 19-23, 28-33

   db.subscriptions.aggregate(
      [
         {
            $project:
               { 
                  Start: "$start",
                  End: "$end", 
                  years:
                     {
                        $dateDiff:
                           {
                              startDate: "$start",
                              endDate: "$end",
                              unit: "year"
                           }
                     }, 
                  months:
                     {
                        $dateDiff:
                           {
                              startDate: "$start",
                              endDate: "$end",
                              unit: "month"
                           }
                     },
                  days:
                     {
                        $dateDiff:
                           {
                              startDate: "$start",
                              endDate: "$end",
                              unit: "day"
                           }
                     },
                  _id: 0 
               }
          }
      ]
    )

The results are summarized in this table:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 23 23 18 18 18

   * - Start
     - End
     - Years
     - Months
     - Days 

   * - 2010-01-01
     - 2011-01-01
     - 1
     - 12
     - 365

   * - 2010-01-01
     - 2011-07-01
     - 1
     - 18
     - 546

   * - 2010-03-01
     - 2010-04-30
     - 0
     - 1
     - 60
 
The count only increments when a new ``unit`` starts, so 18 months are
reported as 1 year in the second row and 60 days are reported as one
month in the third row.

Weeks Per Month
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a collection of months:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.months.insertMany(
        [
           { 
              month: "January",
              start: ISODate("2021-01-01"),
              end: ISODate("2021-01-31")
           },
           { 
              month: "February",
              start: ISODate("2021-02-01"),
              end: ISODate("2021-02-28")
           },
           {
              month: "March",
              start: ISODate("2021-03-01"),
              end: ISODate("2021-03-31")
           },
        ]
      )

You can change the start of each week, and count the resulting number of
weeks in each month with the following code:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 8-13, 17-23, 27-33

   db.months.aggregate(
      [
         {
            $project:
               { 
                  wks_default:
                     {
                        $dateDiff:
                           { 
                              startDate: "$start",  
                              endDate: "$end", 
                              unit: "week"
                           }
                     }, 
                  wks_monday:
                     {
                        $dateDiff:
                           { 
                              startDate: "$start",
                              endDate: "$end", 
                              unit: "week", 
                              startOfWeek: "Monday"
                           }
                     },
                  wks_friday:
                     {
                        $dateDiff:
                           { 
                              startDate: "$start",
                              endDate: "$end",
                              unit: "week",
                              startOfWeek: "fri" 
                           }
                     },
                  _id: 0 
               }
          }
      ]
    )

The results are summarized in this table:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 20 20 20 

   * - Month
     - Sunday
     - Monday

     - 4
     - 3
     - 4

   * - March
     - 4
     - 4
     - 4

From the results:

- When the ``startOfWeek`` is Sunday, the 5th ``week`` in January, 2021
  begins on the 31st.
- Because the 31st is a Sunday and it is between ``startDate`` and
  ``endDate``, one ``week`` is added to the count.
- The ``week`` count is incremented even when a calendar week finishes
  after ``endDate`` or in the next calendar period.
