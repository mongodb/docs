You must ensure that your application can reach your |service-fullname|
environment. To ensure connectivity with |service|, you must whitelist
the inbound network access from your application environment to
|service-fullname| by either whitelisting public IP addresses,
or using :ref:`VPC / VNet peering <vpc-peering>` to whitelist private
IP addresses. To learn more about IP whitelisting, see
:ref:`security-whitelist`.

If your firewall blocks outbound network connections, you must also
open outbound access from your application environment to
|service-fullname|. You must configure your firewall to allow your
applications to make outbound connections to ports 27015 to 27017 to
|tcp| and |udp| traffic on |service| hosts. This grants your
applications access to databases stored on |service|.

.. note::

   By default, |service-fullname| clusters do not need to be able to
   initiate connections to your application environments. However, if
   you wish to enable |service| clusters with
   :ref:`LDAP authentication and authorization <ldaps-authentication-authorization>`,
   you must allow network access from |service| clusters directly to
   your secure |ldap|. You can allow access to your LDAP by using
   public or private IPs as long as a public |dns| hostname points to
   an IP that the |service| clusters can access.

If you are not using :ref:`VPC / VNet peering <vpc-peering>` and plan
to connect to |service-fullname| using public IP addresses, see the
following pages for additional information:
