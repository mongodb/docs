|service| supports using a Key Identifier
provided by Azure Key Vault to configure the
:manual:`encrypted storage engine </core/security-encryption-at-rest>`
on ``M10`` or greater replica set clusters.

This procedure covers configuring Encryption at Rest via 
Azure Key Vault for an |service| project. You must configure
Encryption at Rest for the |service| project before enabling
Encryption at Rest on clusters in that project. For instructions on
enabling Encryption at Rest when deploying an |service| cluster, see
:ref:`create-cluster-enable-encryption`. For instructions on
enabling Encryption at Rest for an existing |service| cluster,
see :ref:`scale-cluster-enable-encryption`.

To learn more about Encryption at Rest in |service|, see
:ref:`security-kms-encryption`.

.. important::

   To disable Encryption at Rest in an |service| project, you must
   disable Encryption at Rest for every cluster in the project 
   *before* removing all configuration details in the project. Do
   **not** disable or delete any Azure Key Vault keys used by any 
   cluster in your |service| project before you have completely disabled
   Encryption at Rest within the |service| project. If |service|
   cannot access an Azure Key Vault key, any data encrypted by that
   key becomes inaccessible.

.. _azure-kms-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-azure-kms-prereqs.rst

.. _security-azure-kms-restrictions:

Restrictions
------------

The following restrictions apply to Encyption at Rest on an |service|
cluster:
    
* Clusters must use ``M10`` or larger servers.

* Sharded clusters are not supported. Your deployment must be a replica
  set.

* For clusters that require backups, you must select
  :ref:`backup-cloud-provider` when
  :ref:`deploying <create-cluster-backups>` or 
  :ref:`modifying <scale-cluster-backups>` the cluster. 
  |service| does not support encrypting 
  :ref:`backup-continuous`.
    
* You cannot enable Encryption at Rest for clusters running on Google 
  Cloud Project (GCP). Support for Encryption at Rest for GCP clusters 
  is in development.

.. note::

   Administrators who deploy clusters on GCP and want to enable backup
   should keep those clusters in a separate project from deployments
   that use Encryption at Rest or Cloud Provider Snapshots.

.. _azure-kms-configure-project:

Configure Encryption at Rest for an |service| project
-----------------------------------------------------
    


.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-azure-encryption-for-project.rst
   
|service| automatically creates a
:alert:`customer master key rotation alert <Azure encryption key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days>`
once you configure Encryption at Rest for a project. You can reset
this alert at any time by 
:ref:`rotating your customer encryption key <azure-kms-rotate-key>`.

.. _azure-kms-rotate-key:

Rotate your Azure Key Identifier
--------------------------------

For clusters using |service| :ref:`security-azure-kms`, |service|
automatically rotates the MongoDB master keys every 90 days. However,
|service| does **not** automatically rotate the Key Identifier
used for Encryption at Rest. This procedure documents manually 
rotating your |service| project Key Identifier by 
specifying a new key identifier in |service|. This procedure
assumes you have already created a new key in the Azure Key Vault
associated to the |service| project.

.. include:: /includes/steps/rotate-azure-encryption-key.rst

|service| resets the :alert:`encryption key rotation alert <Azure encryption key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days>`
timer at the completion of this procedure.
