Overview
--------

Enforcing access control on a :term:`sharded cluster` requires configuring:

- Security between components of the cluster using
  :ref:`Internal Authentication<replica-set-security>`.

- Security between connecting clients and the cluster using
  :doc:`/core/authorization`.

For this tutorial, each member of the sharded cluster *must* use the same
internal authentication mechanism and settings. This means enforcing internal
authentication on each :binary:`~bin.mongos` and :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the cluster.

The following tutorial uses a :ref:`keyfile <internal-auth-keyfile>` to
enable internal authentication.

Enforcing internal authentication also enforces user access control. To
connect to the replica set, clients like :binary:`~bin.mongosh` need to
use a :ref:`user account<authorization>`. See
:ref:`security-shardClust-enforce-access-control`.

CloudManager and OpsManager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If Cloud Manager or Ops Manager is managing your deployment, internal
authentication is automatically enforced.

To configure Access Control on a
managed deployment, see: ``Configure Access Control for MongoDB Deployments``
in the :mms-docs:`Cloud Manager manual
</tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials>`
or in the :opsmgr:`Ops Manager manual
</tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials>`.

Operating System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial primarily refers to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process.
Windows users should use the :binary:`mongod.exe` program instead.

Keyfile Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keyfiles are bare-minimum forms of security and are best suited for testing or
development environments. For production environments we recommend using
:ref:`X.509 certificates<security-auth-x509>`.

Downtime
~~~~~~~~

Upgrading a sharded cluster to enforce access control requires downtime.

X.509 Internal Authentication
-----------------------------

For details on using X.509 for internal authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-member-authentication`.

To upgrade from keyfile internal authentication to X.509 internal
authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-keyfile-to-x509`.
