  .. container:: admonition

     MongoDB drivers automatically attempt server selection following
     a cluster election or failover event. By default, the {{language}} 
     driver immediately raises an error if its first attempt to select 
     a server fails. The following configuration settings may improve 
     application connectivity to an |service| cluster at the expense of 
     spending more time in a server selection loop:

     - Set :manual:`serverSelectionTryOnce </reference/connection-string/index.html#urioption.serverSelectionTryOnce>`
       to ``false`` to direct the {{language}} driver to 
       perform server selection up to the time limit defined by 
       ``serverSelectionTimeoutMS``.  

     - Lower the :manual:`serverSelectionTimeoutMS </reference/connection-string/index.html#urioption.serverSelectionTimeoutMS>`
       to ``15000`` from the default of ``30000``. MongoDB elections 
       typically take 10 seconds, but can be as fast as 5 seconds on 
       |service|. Setting this value to 15 seconds 
       (``15000`` milliseconds) covers the upper bound of election plus
       additional time for latency.
