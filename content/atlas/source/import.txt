You can bring data from existing MongoDB deployments, ``JSON``, or ``CSV``
files into deployments in |service| using either:

- live migration where |service| assists you, or
- tools for a self-guided migration of data from your existing deployments
  into |service|.

.. _c2c-intro:

Live Migrate to Atlas
---------------------

Migrate your data from a source {+cluster+} into |a-service| MongoDB
{+cluster+} using one of the following types of guided live migration
in the {+atlas-ui+}:

- Live migration (pull). For instructions, see :ref:`c2c-pull-live-migration`.
- Live migration (push). For instructions, see :ref:`c2c-push-live-migration`.

.. _self-managed-migration:

Self-Guided Migration Tools
---------------------------

- To load data into a new {+cluster+} in |service|, see :ref:`Load Sample Data <sample-data>`.
- To make a copy of your {+cluster+} for testing purposes, see :manual:`MongoDB Backup Methods </core/backups>`.
- To load data from a JSON or a CSV file into an |service| {+cluster+}, use the {+Compass+} :abbr:`GUI (Graphical User Interface)` .
- To create backups and restore data, use the MongoCLI utilities :manual:`mongorestore and mongodump </tutorial/backup-and-restore-tools/>`.
- To migrate from legacy relational databases to MongoDB, use the :ref:`Relational Migrator <relational-migrator-intro>` tool. 
  Relational Migrator utilizes intelligent algorithms and generative AI to automate solutions to common data modeling, code conversion, and other migration challenges.
- To restore data from an |service| cluster backup to another |service| cluster, use :ref:`restore-overview`.
- If the application that you want to migrate requires a near-continuous uptime, contact :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>` 
  and share your uptime requirements and {+cluster+} configuration.
