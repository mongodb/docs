This section covers enabling |global-write| on an |service| cluster.

Considerations
--------------

- |service| supports enabling Global Writes when deploying an ``M30``
  or greater sharded cluster.

- Once deployed, you cannot convert a |global-write-cluster| to a
  standard sharded cluster. Thoroughly familiarize yourself with the
  :doc:`Global Clusters Overview </global-clusters>` and
  :doc:`Reference Documentation </global-cluster-sharding>` before
  creating a |global-write-cluster|.
