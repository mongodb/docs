replSetSyncFrom
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Description
-----------

.. dbcommand:: replSetSyncFrom

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   Explicitly configures
   which host the current :program:`mongod` pulls :term:`oplog`
   entries from. This operation is useful for testing different
   patterns and in situations where a set member is not replicating from
   the desired host.

   The :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` command has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetSyncFrom: "hostname<:port>" }

   The :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` command has the following field:

   .. include:: /reference/command/replSetSyncFrom-field.rst

The Target Member
-----------------

  The member to replicate from must be a valid source for data in the
  set. The member cannot be:

   - The same as the :program:`mongod` on which you run
     :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom`. In other words, a member cannot
     replicate from itself.
   - An arbiter, because arbiters do not hold data.
   - A member that does not build indexes.
   - An unreachable member.
   - A :program:`mongod` instance that is not a member of the same
     replica set.

   If you attempt to replicate from a member that is more than 10 seconds
   behind the current member, :program:`mongod` will log a
   warning but will still replicate from the lagging member.

   If you run :dbcommand:`replSetSyncFrom` during initial sync, MongoDB
   produces no error messages, but the sync target will not change
   until after the initial sync operation.

Run from the ``mongo`` Shell
----------------------------

   To run the command in the :program:`mongo` shell, use the following
   invocation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { replSetSyncFrom: "hostname<:port>" } )

   You may also use the :method:`rs.syncFrom()` helper in the
   :program:`mongo` shell in an operation with the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.syncFrom("hostname<:port>")

   .. note::

   .. slave-ok, admin-only
