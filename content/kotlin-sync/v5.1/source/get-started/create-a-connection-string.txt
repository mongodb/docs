==========================
Create a Connection String
==========================

You can connect to your MongoDB deployment by providing a
**connection URI**, also called a *connection string*, which
instructs the driver on how to connect to a MongoDB deployment
and how to behave while connected.

The connection string includes the hostname or IP address and 
port of your deployment, the authentication mechanism, user credentials 
when applicable, and connection options.

To connect to an instance or deployment not hosted on Atlas, see the :ref:`kotlin-sync-connection-targets` guide.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Find your MongoDB Atlas Connection String

      To retrieve your connection string for the deployment that
      you created in the :ref:`previous step <kotlin-sync-get-started-create-deployment>`,
      log into your Atlas account, navigate to the
      :guilabel:`Database` section, then click the :guilabel:`Connect` button
      for your new deployment.

      Proceed to the :guilabel:`Connect your application` section, then select
      **{+language+}** from the :guilabel:`Driver` selection menu.

      Select the :guilabel:`Password (SCRAM)` authentication mechanism.
      
      Deselect the :guilabel:`Include full driver code example` option to view
      only the connection string.

   .. step:: Copy your Connection String

      Click the button on the right of the connection string to copy it to
      your clipboard as shown in the following screenshot:

   .. step:: Update the Placeholders

      Paste this connection string into a file in your preferred text editor
      and replace the ``<username>`` and ``<password>`` placeholders with
      your database user's username and password.
      
      Save this file to a safe location to use in the next step.

After completing these steps, you have a connection string that
contains your database username and password.
