This tutorial covers backing up your snapshots on file system storage.

Considerations
--------------

- |onprem| doesn't compress backups to file system stores from MongoDB
  databases running |fcv-link| 4.2 or later. |onprem| ignores the
  :setting:`File System Store Gzip Compression Level` setting for those
  databases.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-shared-file-system-reqs.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

Before creating any file system snapshot stores:

- Attach storage volumes with sufficient capacity to the |onprem| host.
  The file system snapshot store stores only the backup snapshots. The 
  :opsmgr:`Oplog Store  </reference/glossary/#std-term-Oplog-Store-Database>` MongoDB database path 
  should be on a different local file system. To learn more, see 
  :ref:`manage-oplog-storage`.

- Grant the storage volumes the relevant permissions:

  - On Windows, grant access to the ``SYSTEM`` user.
  - On package-installed Linux distributions, grant access to the
    ``mongodb-mms:mongodb-mms`` user and group.
  - On archive extracted Linux distributions, grant access to the same
    user and group you assigned to the |onprem| installation.

- :doc:`Deploy the dedicated MongoDB instance(s) 
  </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>` to host this snapshot 
  store.

- Ensure the host running the |onprem| :opsmgr:`Backup Daemon </reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-daemon>` service
  has sufficient capacity to store the :term:`head` database.

- When running many |onprem| instances, use a |nas| or |san| for your
  file system store. This ensures that all instances share the same
  storage. You can't restore backups or remove expired snapshots if the
  |onprem| instances don't share the file system store.

Add a File System Store

Edit an Existing File System Store
----------------------------------

Once created, file system stores are listed directly on the
:guilabel:`Snapshot Storage` page in a table. Each row contains the
settings for each File System Store.
