You can configure the {+cluster+} tier ranges that |service| uses to
automatically scale your {+cluster+} tier, storage capacity, or both in
response to {+cluster+} usage.

{+Cluster+} auto-scaling removes the need to write scripts or use
consulting services to make scaling decisions. To help control costs,
you can specify a range of maximum and minimum {+cluster+} sizes that
your {+cluster+} can automatically scale to.

Auto-scaling works on a rolling basis, meaning the process doesn't
incur any downtime.

How |service| Scales {+Cluster+} Tier
-------------------------------------

|service| analyzes the following {+cluster+} metrics to determine when 
to scale a {+cluster+}, and whether to scale the {+cluster+} tier up or 
down:

- CPU utilization

- Memory utilization

.. note::

   To determine memory utilization, |service| calculates the following
   delta: ``total system memory`` - (``free`` + ``buffer`` + ``cache``),
   where ``free``, ``buffer``, and ``cache`` are amounts of available
   memory that |service| can reclaim for other purposes. |service| then
   divides that delta by the ``total system memory``. To learn more,
   see :guilabel:`System Memory` in :ref:`review-available-metrics`.

Before |service| scales your {+cluster+} tier, it checks that the 
{+cluster+} wouldn't move to a tier outside of your specified
:guilabel:`Minimum` and :guilabel:`Maximum Cluster Size` range.

Scaling Up a {+Cluster+} Tier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Tier Availability

   Automatic scaling works on :guilabel:`General` and
   :guilabel:`Low-CPU` tier {+clusters+}, but *not* on
   :guilabel:`Local NVMe SSD` tier {+clusters+}.

If the next highest {+cluster+} tier is within your
:guilabel:`Maximum Cluster Size` range, |service| scales the {+cluster+}
up to the next tier if *one* of the following criteria is true for 
*any* node in the {+cluster+}:

- The :guilabel:`Average CPU Utilization` has exceeded 75% for the 
  past hour.

- The :guilabel:`Memory Utilization` has exceeded 75% for the past 
  hour.

|service| scales a {+cluster+} to the next tier when the {+cluster+} 
hasn't been scaled up in the past hour.

.. important:: Sudden Workload Spikes

   Scaling up to a greater {+cluster+} tier requires enough time to
   prepare backing resources. Automatic scaling may not occur when a
   {+cluster+} receives a burst of activity, such as a bulk insert.
   To reduce the risk of running out of resources, plan to scale up
   {+clusters+} before bulk inserts and other workload spikes.

Scaling Down a {+Cluster+} Tier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the next lowest {+cluster+} tier is within your
:guilabel:`Minimum Cluster Size` range, |service| scales the {+cluster+}
down to the next lowest tier if *both* of the following criteria are 
true for *all* nodes in the {+cluster+}:

- The average :guilabel:`CPU Utilization` and
  :guilabel:`Memory Utilization` over the past 24 hours is below 50%.

- The {+cluster+} hasn't been scaled down (manually or automatically) in
  the past 24 hours.

.. note::

   ``M10`` and ``M20`` {+clusters+} use lower thresholds to account for
   caps on CPU usage that cloud providers set after burst periods. These
   thresholds vary depending on your cloud provider and cluster tier.

To learn more about downward auto-scaling behavior, see
:ref:`downward-scaling-considerations`.

.. _downward-scaling-considerations:

Considerations for Downward Auto-Scaling of Cluster Tier and Storage
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

- When |service| downscales the storage capacity of your {+cluster+}, 
  this can take longer than expanding storage capacity due to the 
  mechanics of the scaling process.
- When |service| downscales your {+cluster+} to a lower {+cluster+} 
  tier, it uses the value in the :guilabel:`Minimum Cluster Size`. 
  Estimate your deployment's range of workloads and then set the 
  :guilabel:`Minimum Cluster Size` value to the {+cluster+} tier that 
  has enough capacity to handle your deployment's workload. Account for 
  any possible spikes or dips in {+cluster+} activity.

- You can't scale to a {+cluster+} smaller than ``M10``.

- When |service| downscales your {+cluster+}, it checks that your 
  minimum {+cluster+} tier bound supports the current disk
  configuration of your {+cluster+}. If your selected minimum
  {+cluster+} tier can't support your current disk configuration,
  |service| adjusts your minimum tier to the next lowest tier that can 
  support your configuration.

  .. example::

     You have set your auto-scaling bounds to ``M10``-``M60`` and your
     current {+cluster+} tier is ``M40``. |service| triggers a downward
     auto-scaling event because the average :guilabel:`CPU Utilization` 
     and :guilabel:`Memory Utilization` on your current {+cluster+} has 
     been under 50% for the past 24 hours.

     1. |service| attempts to auto-scale your {+cluster+} down to 
        ``M30``. ``M30`` supports your current disk configuration, so 
        the auto-scaling operation succeeds.

     #. |service| checks your minimum {+cluster+} bound (``M10``) and
        determines that ``M10`` can't support your current disk
        configuration.

     #. |service| determines that ``M20`` is the lowest {+cluster+} tier
        that can support your current disk configuration, and sets
        your minimum {+cluster+} tier to ``M20``.

Scaling a Sharded {+Cluster+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| auto-scales the {+cluster+} tier for sharded {+clusters+} 
using the same criteria as replica sets. |service| applies the 
following rules:

- Auto-scaling applies to all shards in the sharded {+cluster+}. You 
  can't apply auto-scaling for some shards and not for others within 
  the same {+cluster+}.
- If *any* shard meets the criteria to auto-scale its {+cluster+} tier 
  up, all shards will scale their {+cluster+} tier up.
- *All* shards in the {+cluster+} must meet the criteria before
  |service| will auto-scale the {+cluster+} tier down.
- The Config server replica set doesn't auto-scale.

.. _howitworks-scale-cluster-storage:

How |service| Scales Cluster Storage
------------------------------------

Cluster storage auto-scaling is enabled by default. |service| 
automatically increases {+cluster+} storage when disk space used 
reaches 90%. 

.. important:: High-Speed Write Activity

   Scaling up to greater storage capacity requires sufficient time to
   prepare and copy data to new disks. Automatic scaling might not occur
   when a {+cluster+} receives a burst of high-speed write activity, 
   such as a bulk insert. To reduce the risk of running out of disk 
   storage, {+cluster+} managers should plan to scale up {+clusters+} 
   in advance of bulk inserts and other instances of high-speed write 
   activity.

The scaling behavior differs by cloud provider:

- On :ref:`AWS <amazon-aws>` and :ref:`GCP <google-gcp>` {+clusters+},
  |service| increases {+cluster+} storage capacity to achieve 70% disk 
  space used. To learn more about |aws| storage change limitations and
  how |service| works around them, see 
  :ref:`change-storage-capacity-aws`.

- On :ref:`Azure <microsoft-azure>` {+clusters+}, |service| doubles the
  current amount of {+cluster+} storage.

.. important::

   |service| automatically scales {+cluster+} storage only up, and never
   automatically scales {+cluster+} storage down. You can manually 
   reduce your {+cluster+} storage from the :ref:`Edit Cluster 
   <scale-cluster>` page.

{+Cluster+} Tier and {+Cluster+} Storage Might Scale in Parallel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When |service| attempts to automatically scale your {+cluster+} storage
capacity, it might need to scale your storage outside of the bounds
supported that your current {+cluster+} tier supports. To help ensure 
that your {+cluster+} doesn't experience any downtime, |service| will 
scale your {+cluster+} tier (in addition to {+cluster+} storage) to 
accommodate the new storage capacity.

.. example::

   The maximum storage capacity for an ``M30`` {+cluster+} is 480 GB. If
   you have an ``M30`` {+cluster+} with the maximum storage allocated 
   and your disk space used reaches 90%, a storage auto-scaling event 
   requires raising your storage capacity to 600 GB. In this case,
   |service| scales your {+cluster+} tier up to ``M40`` because this is
   the lowest {+cluster+} tier that can support the new required
   storage capacity.

In the event that your specified maximum {+cluster+} tier can't support
the new storage capacity, |service|:

1. Raises your maximum {+cluster+} tier to the next lowest tier that can
   accommodate the new storage capacity.

#. Scales your {+cluster+} tier to that new maximum tier.

.. note::

   When |service| overrides your maximum {+cluster+} tier, it also
   disables your {+cluster+} from automatically scaling down. To re-enable
   downward auto-scaling, configure it in :ref:`Cluster Settings <scale-cluster>`.
   See also :ref:`downward-scaling-considerations`.

If |service| attempts to scale your {+cluster+} tier down and the target
tier can't support your current disk capacity, provisioned |iops|,
or both, |service| doesn't scale your {+cluster+} down. In this
scenario, |service| updates your auto-scaling settings based on the
relationship between your current {+cluster+} tier and the configured
maximum {+cluster+} tier:

- If the {+cluster+} is currently at the configured maximum {+cluster+}
  tier, |service| disables the {+cluster+} from automatically scaling
  down because all smaller tiers wouldn't be able to accommodate
  the necessary storage settings. If you want to re-enable downward
  auto-scaling, you must do so manually from your :ref:`Cluster
  Settings <scale-cluster>`.

- If the {+cluster+} isn't currently at the configured maximum
  {+cluster+} tier, |service| raises the minimum {+cluster+} tier to 
  the current {+cluster+} tier. In this case, |service| doesn't disable 
  downward auto-scaling.

This auto-scaling logic is designed to reduce the downtime incurred by
your storage settings not matching your workload.

When an auto-scaling event modifies your configured minimum or maximum
{+cluster+} tier, |service| sends an email to all project owners about
the new {+cluster+} tier and any modified minimum or maximum tier bounds.

Oplog Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/autoscale-oplog.rst

Configure Auto-Scaling Options
------------------------------

You can configure auto-scaling options when you
:ref:`create <create-new-cluster>` or :ref:`modify <scale-cluster>` a
{+cluster+}. For new clusters, |service| automatically enables
{+cluster+} tier auto-scaling and storage auto-scaling. You can review 
and adjust the upper and lower {+cluster+} tiers that |service| should 
use when auto-scaling your {+cluster+}, or you can :ref:`opt out 
<opt-out-autoscaling>`.

|service| displays auto-scaling options in the :guilabel:`Auto-scale`
section of the {+cluster+} builder for :guilabel:`General` and
:guilabel:`Low-CPU` tier {+clusters+}.

.. _configure-cluster-autoscaling:

Auto-Scaling Enabled by Default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you create a new {+cluster+}, |service| enables auto-scaling for
{+cluster+} tier and {+cluster+} storage. You don't need
to explicitly enable auto-scaling. If you prefer, you can
:ref:`opt out <opt-out-autoscaling>` for {+cluster+} tier and cluster
storage.

.. note::
   |service| enables cluster tier auto-scaling by default when you 
   create {+clusters+} in the {+atlas-ui+}. If you
   :ref:`create clusters with the API <create-one-cluster-ref>`,
   |service| disables {+cluster+} tier auto-scaling by default.

With auto-scaling enabled, your {+cluster+} can automatically:

- Scale up to increase capability with a higher {+cluster+} tier.
- Decrease the current {+cluster+} tier to a lower {+cluster+} tier.

In the :guilabel:`Cluster tier` section of the :guilabel:`Auto-scale`
options, you can specify the :guilabel:`Maximum Cluster Size` and
:guilabel:`Minimum Cluster Size` values that your {+cluster+} can
automatically scale to. |service| sets these values as follows:

- The :guilabel:`Maximum Cluster Size` is set to one tier above your
  current {+cluster+} tier.

- The :guilabel:`Minimum Cluster Size` is set to the current {+cluster+}
  tier.

Review the {+Cluster+} Tier Auto-Scaling Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To review the enabled auto-scaling options for {+cluster+} tier and 
storage:

1. In the selected :guilabel:`Auto-Scale` checkbox, review
   the :guilabel:`Maximum Cluster Size` and
   :guilabel:`Minimum Cluster Size` values, and adjust them if needed.

#. Review the :guilabel:`Allow cluster to be scaled down` option 
   that is checked by default when you create a new {+cluster+}.

#. Review the options under the :guilabel:`Storage Scaling` checkbox
   that is checked by default.

.. _opt-out-autoscaling:

Opt Out of {+Cluster+} Tier and Storage Auto-Scaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To opt out of {+cluster+} auto-scaling (increasing the cluster tier), 
when :ref:`creating a new cluster <create-new-cluster>`, navigate to the
:guilabel:`Cluster Tier` menu, and un-check the
:guilabel:`Cluster Tier Scaling` checkbox in the :guilabel:`Auto-scale`
section.

To opt out of {+cluster+} auto-scaling (decreasing the cluster tier), 
when :ref:`creating a new cluster <create-new-cluster>`, navigate to
:guilabel:`Cluster Tier` menu, and un-check the
:guilabel:`Allow cluster to be scaled down` checkbox in the
:guilabel:`Auto-scale` section.

To opt out of cluster storage scaling, un-check the
:guilabel:`Storage Scaling` checkbox in the :guilabel:`Auto-scale`
section.

.. _ack-auto-scaling-events:

Acknowledge Auto-Scaling Events
-------------------------------

When an auto-scaling event occurs:

- |service| logs the event in the project :guilabel:`Activity Feed`. To
  learn more about the :guilabel:`Activity Feed`, see
  :ref:`project-activity-feed`.

- |service| sends an email to all project owners about the original
  {+cluster+} tier and the new {+cluster+} tier after auto-scaling has
  occurred.
