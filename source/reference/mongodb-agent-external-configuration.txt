To meet advanced auditing or compliance needs, you may need to do one
or both of the following actions:

- Store the |mongod| or |mongos| (collectively, the MongoDB process)
  configuration in memory to avoid writing passwords to disk.
- Remove {+mdbagent+} passwords from the {+mdbagent+} configuration
  file and read the passwords passed in the shell command.

.. _mdbagent-config-inmem:

Store MongoDB Process Configuration Files in Memory
---------------------------------------------------

MongoDB :manual:`configuration files </reference/configuration-options>` 
may contain credentials such as:

- :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFilePassword`
- :setting:`net.tls.clusterPassword`
- :setting:`security.kmip.clientCertificatePassword`
- :setting:`security.ldap.bind.queryPassword`

By default, the {+mdbagent+} writes MongoDB process configuration files
to disk. However, you can store the configuration files in memory 
by setting :setting:`enableLocalConfigurationServer` to ``true`` 
in your 
:ref:`{+mdbagent+} configuration file <mongodb-agent-config-file-location>`. 
Changing this setting results in the following actions:

- The {+mdbagent+} caches your MongoDB process configuration in memory.
- The MongoDB configuration file on disk contains only a
  :configexpansion:`directive <__rest>` that points to the full
  configuration file.

When the {+mdbagent+} uses an in-memory MongoDB configuration, the MongoDB 
process requests the full configuration file from its local 
{+mdbagent+}. The Agent requests the configuration file using the |url| 
in the :configexpansion:`__rest` expansion directive.

.. warning::
  
   If you use |onprem| version 4.2 or versions 4.4.0 - 4.4.6, you may encounter
   errors when setting :setting:`enableLocalConfigurationServer` to ``true``. 
   To avoid this, see :ref:`store-conf-in-memory`.

Considerations

Impacts Availability of MongoDB Deployments

.. include:: /includes/consideration-external-config-impacts-availability.rst

Limits Importing Existing MongoDB Deployments
`````````````````````````````````````````````

You can't :doc:`import </tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes>`
MongoDB processes that store configuration files in memory. When the
{+mdbagent+} stores its configuration in memory, MongoDB
redacts any credentials after it starts. Therefore, MongoDB
can't retrieve the credentials needed to import the process.

.. _mdbagent-config-nopass:

Remove Passwords from the MongoDB Agent Configuration File
----------------------------------------------------------

You can set the {+mdbagent+} to read its passwords as shell command
flags rather than read from its configuration file. To use this
feature, add the following settings to the {+mdbagent+}\'s
configuration file:

.. cond:: onprem

   - :setting:`mmsApiKeyExec`
   - :setting:`tlsMMSServerClientCertificatePasswordExec`

.. cond:: cloud

   - :setting:`mmsApiKeyExec`
