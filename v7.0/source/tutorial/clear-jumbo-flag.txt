If MongoDB cannot split a chunk that exceeds the :ref:`specified range
size <sharding-range-size>`, MongoDB labels the chunk as 
:ref:`jumbo <jumbo-chunks>`.

The following procedures outline the steps to manually clear the 
``jumbo`` flag.

Procedures
----------

.. _preferred-method-clear-jumbo:

Divisible Chunks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preferred manual way to clear the ``jumbo`` flag from a chunk is to
attempt to split the chunk. If the chunk is divisible, MongoDB removes
the flag upon successful split of the chunk.

Indivisible Chunks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some instances, MongoDB cannot split the no-longer ``jumbo`` chunk,
such as a chunk with a range of single shard key value. As such, you
cannot split the chunk to clear the flag.

In such cases, you can either :ref:`change the shard key
<change-a-shard-key>` so that the chunk can become divisible or manually
clear the flag.

Refine the Shard Key
````````````````````

MongoDB provides the :dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command. Using the
:dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command, you can refine a
collection's shard key by adding a suffix field or fields to the
existing key. By adding new field(s) to the shard key, indivisible
jumbo chunks can become divisible.

.. _clear-jumbo-flag-manually:

Manually Clear the ``jumbo`` Flag for an Indivisible Chunk
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

To manually clear the ``jumbo`` flag, you can use the 
:dbcommand:`clearJumboFlag` command. If you clear the ``jumbo`` flag for a chunk 
that still exceeds the chunk size, MongoDB will re-label the chunk as ``jumbo`` 
when MongoDB tries to move the chunk.

.. important:: 
   
   Only use this method if the :ref:`preferred method 
   <preferred-method-clear-jumbo>` is *not* applicable.
