title: "Run an |fts| multilingual query that searches for an English and Italian term."
content: |

  a. Create a file named ``two-languages-query.py``. 
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the ``two-languages.py`` 
     file.

     The following code example:

     - Imports ``pymongo``, MongoDB's Python driver, and the ``dns``
       module, which is required to connect ``pymongo`` to ``Atlas`` 
       using a |dns| seed list connection string. 

     - Creates an instance of the ``MongoClient`` class to establish a 
       connection to your |service| cluster.

     - Uses the following ``compound`` operator clauses to query the collection:

       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-multilingual2-constant-desc.rst 
       
       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-multilingual-stage.rst

     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.

     .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/multilingual/multilingual2.py
        :language: python
        :linenos:
        :dedent:
        :emphasize-lines: 5

  #. .. include:: /includes/fts/facts/fact-fts-driver-connection-string.rst
  #. Run the following command to query your collection:
  
     .. io-code-block::
        :copyable: true 

        .. input:: 
           :language: shell
           
           python two-languages.py

        .. output::
           :language: python

             penny-farthing bicycle in his shop, all the while being watched over 
             by the constantly changing photograph of Uncle Albert, which endangers

             displays it in his living room as a work of art. His fiery wife Bella
