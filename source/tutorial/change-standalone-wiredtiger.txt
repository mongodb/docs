Change Standalone to WiredTiger
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 3.0
   The WiredTiger storage engine is available.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2
   WiredTiger is the new default storage engine for MongoDB.

This tutorial gives an overview of changing the storage engine of a
:term:`standalone` MongoDB instance to :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>`.

Considerations
--------------

This tutorial uses the :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`
utilities to export and import data. Ensure that these MongoDB package
components are installed and updated on your system. In addition, make
sure you have sufficient drive space available for the
:binary:`~bin.mongodump` export file and the data files of your new
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance running with WiredTiger.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-default-bind-ip-change.rst

   The tutorial runs :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`
   from the same host as the :binary:`~bin.mongod` they are connecting to.
   If run remotely, :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`
   must specify the ip address or the associated hostname in order to
   connect to the :binary:`~bin.mongod`.
