Pipeline Stages
---------------

|fts| queries take the form of an :manual:`aggregation pipeline stage 
</aggregation>`. |fts| provides :pipeline:`$search` and 
:pipeline:`$searchMeta` stages, both of which must be the first stage 
in any query pipeline, including the :pipeline:`$lookup` and
:pipeline:`$unionWith` sub-pipelines. These stages can be used in
conjunction with other :manual:`aggregation pipeline stages
</aggregation>` in your query pipeline.

Based on the pipeline stage that you choose, your 
query returns either the search results of a full-text search or 
metadata about your search results:

Operators and Collectors
------------------------

|fts| also provides query :ref:`operators <operators-ref>` and 
:ref:`collectors <collectors-ref>` that you can use inside the 
:pipeline:`$search` and :pipeline:`$searchMeta` aggregation
pipeline stages. The |fts| operators allow you to
locate and retrieve relevant data from the collection on your 
{+cluster+}. The collector returns a document representing the search
metadata results. 

You can use |fts| operators to query terms, phrases, geographic shapes 
and points, numeric values, similar documents, synonymous terms, and 
more.

You can also search using regex and wildcard expressions. The |fts|
:ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operator allows you to combine multiple operators 
inside your :pipeline:`$search` stage to perform a complex search and 
filter of data based on what *must*, *must not*, or *should* be present 
in the documents returned by |fts|. You can use the :ref:`compound <compound-ref>` 
operator to also match or filter documents in the :pipeline:`$search` 
stage itself. Running :pipeline:`$match` after :pipeline:`$search` is 
less performant than running :pipeline:`$search` with the 
:ref:`compound <compound-ref>` operator.

To learn more about operators and collectors, see :ref:`operators-ref`.

.. _about-mongot:

Query Processing
----------------

``mongod`` and ``mongot`` on the Same Node
  When you run a query, |fts| uses the :ref:`configured read preference
  <replica-set-tags>` to identify the node on which to run the query. The
  query first goes to the MongoDB process, which is ``mongod`` for a
  replica set cluster or ``mongos`` for a sharded cluster.  

  For a replica set {+cluster+}, the MongoDB process routes the query to
  the ``mongot`` on the same node. For sharded clusters, your cluster data
  is partitioned across ``mongod`` instances and each ``mongot`` knows
  about the data on the ``mongod`` on the same node only. Therefore, you
  can't run |fts| queries that target a particular  shard. ``mongos``
  directs the queries to all shards, making these *scatter gather*
  queries. If you use :manual:`zones </core/zone-sharding/>` to
  distribute a sharded collection over a subset of the shards in the
  {+cluster+}, |fts| routes the query to the zone that contains the
  shards for the collection that you are querying and runs your
  :pipeline:`$search` queries on just the shards where the collection is
  located.  

  |fts| performs the search and scoring and returns the document IDs and
  other search metadata for the matching results to ``mongod``. The
  ``mongod`` then performs a full document lookup implicitly for the
  matching results and returns the results to the client.

``mongod`` and ``mongot`` on Different Nodes 
  When you run a query, the query first goes to the ``mongod`` based on
  the :ref:`configured read preference <replica-set-tags>`. The
  ``mongod`` process routes the search query through a load balancer on
  the same node, which distributes the requests across all of the
  ``mongot`` processes. 
  
  The |fts| ``mongot`` process performs the search and scoring and
  returns the document IDs and metadata for the matching results to
  ``mongod``. The ``mongod`` then performs a full document lookup for
  the matching results and returns the results to the client. If you use 
  the :pipeline:`$search` :ref:`concurrent <concurrent-ref>` option in
  your query, |fts| enables intra-query parallelism. To learn more, see
  :ref:`Parallelize Query Execution Across Segments <concurrent-ref>`.   

Scoring
-------

|fts| associates a relevance-based score with every document in the 
result set. The relevance-based scoring allows |fts| to return documents
in the order from the highest score to the lowest. |fts| scores 
documents higher if the query term appears frequently in a document and 
lower if the query term appears across many documents in the 
collection. |fts| also supports customizing the relevance-based default 
score by boosting, decaying, or other modifying options. To learn more 
about customizing the resulting scores, see :ref:`scoring-ref`.

Troubleshoot Queries
--------------------

.. _troubleshoot-empty-results:

Empty Result Set 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongot`` doesn't return any errors, but returns an empty result set if
your :pipeline:`$search` query:

- References an index that doesn't exist. If you don't specify an index
  by name in the query, |fts| defaults to an index named ``default``. If
  you don't have an index named ``default`` or if the index that you
  specified doesn't exist, |fts| doesn't return an error and returns an
  empty result set. You can specify a valid index by its name using the
  ``index`` option.
- Specifies a non-indexed field. If you run a query against a field that
  isn't indexed, |fts| doesn't return an error and returns an empty
  result set. You must specify only indexed fields as values for the 
  ``path`` parameter. You can enable :ref:`dynamic mapping
  <static-dynamic-mappings>` in your index definition for the collection
  to ensure that all the :ref:`dynamically indexable fields
  <bson-data-chart>` in the collection are automatically indexed. To
  learn more, see :ref:`dynamic mapping <static-dynamic-mappings>`.
- Uses the ``text`` operator on a field path which is not indexed as a 
  ``string`` type. If a field is indexed as a |fts| field type other than 
  ``string``, such as ``stringFacet`` or ``autocomplete``, |fts| doesn't 
  return an error and returns an empty result set. You *must* index the 
  fields with ``string`` |bson| data type values as 
  :ref:`string <bson-data-types-string>` type to query the fields using 
  the :ref:`text <text-ref>` operator.

``PlanExecutor`` Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongot`` returns a ``PlanExecutor`` error if your :pipeline:`$search` query:

- Specifies a field that is indexed as an incorrect data type. In this
  case, if you run a query, |fts| returns an error message identifying the 
  field that was indexed incorrectly and its correct data type. For 
  example:

  .. code-block:: shell
     :copyable: false

     PlanExecutor error during aggregation :: caused by :: Cannot facet on field "genres" because 
     it was not indexed as a "stringFacet" field.

  For example, to run :ref:`fts-facet-ref` queries
  against ``string``, ``number``, or ``date`` fields, create an index
  for the fields using the corresponding |fts| field type such as
  ``stringFacet``, ``number``, and ``date`` respectively. To learn more,
  see :ref:`Supported and Unsupported Data Types <bson-data-chart>`.
