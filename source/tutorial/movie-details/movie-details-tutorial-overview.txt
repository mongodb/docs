Introduction
------------

This tutorial explores features and capabilities of |charts| with
a :doc:`data source </data-sources>` containing the ``Mflix``
:atlas:`sample data provided by Atlas </sample-data/sample-mflix>`.
This sample data contains information on movies such as release year,
cast, and reviews.

The following is a sample document from the dataset:

       count, and turned into one of his thralls, protecting him during his sea voyage to London. 
       After sucking the blood and turning the young Lucy Weston into a vampire, Dracula turns his
       attention to her friend Mina Seward, daughter of Dr. Seward who then calls in a specialist, 
       Dr. Van Helsing, to diagnose the sudden deterioration of Mina's health. Van Helsing, 
       realizing that Dracula is indeed a vampire, tries to prepare Mina's fiance, John Harker, 
       and Dr. Seward for what is to come and the measures that will have to be taken to prevent 
       Mina from becoming one of the undead.",

With this tutorial, you will learn how to use filters to refine a large
result set down to an easily understandable chart, and use multi-series
charts to gain further insight into the data.

In this tutorial, you'll create two charts: a sorted column
chart and a scatter chart.

- The :ref:`sorted column chart <movie-details-column>`
  displays columns representing the number
  of awards won by directors with at least 50 total awards,
  sorted from highest to lowest and broken down by film genre.

- The :ref:`scatter chart <movie-details-scatter>` shows
  a diagram of movies with at least one
  award win along with their TomatoMeter rating
  and their :abbr:`MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America)` rating
  (G, PG, PG-13, or R).
