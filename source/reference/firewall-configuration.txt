  Accessible Ports
  ----------------

  The |mms| application must be able to connect to users and |mms|
  agents over or Secure HTTP (HTTPS). |mms| agents must be able to
  connect to MongoDB client MongoDB databases.

  Though |mms| only requires open HTTP(S) and MongoDB network ports to
  connect with users and to databases, what ports are opened on a
  firewall depend upon what capabilities are enabled: encryption,
  authentication and monitoring.

  This page defines which systems need to connect to which ports on
  other systems.
