Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-long+} to construct expressions 
for use in the aggregation pipeline. 
With the {+driver-short+}, you can perform expression operations with
discoverable, typesafe Java methods rather than BSON documents.
Because these methods follow the fluent interface pattern, you can chain 
aggregation operations together to create code that is both more compact and 
more naturally readable.  

.. tip:: 

   For more information about aggregation expressions that use the Query API, see the 
   :manual:`Aggregation Pipeline Operators </reference/operator/aggregation/>` 
   page in the Server manual.
