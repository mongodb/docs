The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a replica set from
the MongoDB Community Edition to the MongoDB Enterprise Edition. For
example, the steps can be used to upgrade MongoDB 4.0 Community to
MongoDB 4.0 Enterprise.

Rolling Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When updating the replica set manually, you can perform a
rolling upgrade to update each MongoDB Community Server to
Enterprise edition with minimal downtime.

In a rolling upgrade, each secondary is taken down and upgraded.
The Enterprise server then rejoins the replica set as a
secondary. When all secondaries are upgraded, you can
:term:`step down` the primary, forcing the replica set to elect
one of the Enterprise servers as the new primary.

Steps
-----

To minimize downtime, manually upgrade each from MongoDB
Community Server to Enterprise Edition: 

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Upgrade the secondaries

      Upgrade each secondary member of the replica set
      individually. Finish the upgrade process on one server and
      wait until it rejoins the replica set as an Enterprise
      server before starting the next.

      For the procedure, see :ref:`Upgrade to MongoDB Enterprise 
      Server <upgrade-to-enterprise-procedure>`.

   .. step:: Step down the primary

      When all secondaries in the replica set are up and running
      MongoDB Enterprise Server, :term:`step down` the primary
      member. This forces an election, causing an Enterprise
      Server to become the new primary member.

      To step down the primary member, use the 
      :method:`rs.status` method to get the ``id``
      of the current primary member:

      .. io-code-block::

         .. input::
            :language: javascript

            rs.status().members.find(m => m.state === 1)._id

         .. output:: 
            :language: javascript

            0

      Then, force the primary to step down with the
      :method:`rs.stepDown` method:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.stepDown( 120 )

      This command steps down the primary and makes the server
      ineligible as primary for 120 seconds. If no primary is
      found after 120 seconds, the server can then be reelected.
      For more information, see the :method:`rs.stepDown`
      method.

      To confirm that the primary member has stepped down and
      the replica set has chose a new primary, rerun the
      :method:`rs.status` method:

      .. io-code-block::

         .. input::
            :language: javascript

            rs.status().members.find(m => m.state === 1)._id

         .. output:: 
            :language: javascript

            1

   .. step:: Upgrade the primary 

      Upgrade the former primary member. When the former
      primary starts, it rejoins the replica set as a secondary.

      For the procedure, see :ref:`Upgrade to MongoDB Enterprise 
      Server <upgrade-to-enterprise-procedure>`.

.. important::

   Before using any Enterprise features, ensure that all members have
   been upgraded to Enterprise edition.
