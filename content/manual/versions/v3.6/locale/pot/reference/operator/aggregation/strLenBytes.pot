msgid "For example, US-ASCII characters are encoded using one byte. Characters with diacritic markings and additional Latin alphabetical characters (i.e. Latin characters outside of the English alphabet) are encoded using two bytes. Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters typically require three bytes, and other planes of unicode (emoji, mathematical symbols, etc.) require four bytes."

msgid "The :expression:`$strLenBytes` operator differs from :expression:`$strLenCP` operator which counts the `code points <http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#code_point>`_ in the specified string regardless of how many bytes each character uses."
