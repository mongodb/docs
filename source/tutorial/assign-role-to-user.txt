====================
Assign a User a Role
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

A role provides a user privileges to perform a set of :ref:`actions
<security-user-actions>` on a :ref:`resource <resource-document>`. A
user can have multiple roles.

In MongoDB systems where :setting:`auth` is enabled, you must grant a user a
role for the user to access a database resource. To assign a role, first
determine the privileges the user needs and then determine the role that
grants those privileges.

For an overview of roles and privileges, see :ref:`authorization`.
For descriptions of the access each system role provides, see
:ref:`system-defined roles <system-user-roles>.`
