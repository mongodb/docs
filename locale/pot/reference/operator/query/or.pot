msgid "When evaluating the clauses in the :query:`$or` expression, MongoDB either performs a collection scan or, if all the clauses are supported by indexes, MongoDB performs index scans. That is, for MongoDB to use indexes to evaluate an :query:`$or` expression, all the clauses in the :query:`$or` expression must be supported by indexes. Otherwise, MongoDB will perform a collection scan."

This is because a :query:`$text` query *must* use an index, and :query:`$or` can only use indexes if all its clauses are supported by indexes. If the :query:`$text` query cannot use an index, the query will return an error."
