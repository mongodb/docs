You can set or change your app's log level to develop or debug your 
application. You might want to change the log level to log different 
amounts of data depending on the app's environment.

   For information on how to set the Sync client log level, refer to
   :ref:`cpp-set-the-sync-log-level`.

Set the Realm Log Level
-----------------------

You can set the level of detail reported by the Realm C++ SDK. Pass a 
:cpp-sdk:`realm::logger::level <structrealm_1_1logger.html>`
to the ``set_default_level_threshold()`` member function:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/logger.snippet.set-default-log-level.cpp
   :language: cpp

.. _cpp-customize-logging-function:

Customize the Logging Function
------------------------------

To set a custom logger function, create a 
:cpp-sdk:`realm::logger <structrealm_1_1logger.html#a1c4a96ab2eb5e6b164f17552c233104a>`
and override the virtual ``do_log()`` member function:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/logger.snippet.create-custom-logger.cpp
   :language: cpp

Then, initialize an instance of the logger and set it as the default logger
for your realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/logger.snippet.initialize-logger.cpp
   :language: cpp
