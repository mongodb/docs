   :description: Discover how Ops Manager automates MongoDB management, including deployment, maintenance, and handling failures during upgrades.

This addresses common questions about |mms| and its Automation
features.

|mms| can automate management operations for your monitored MongoDB
processes, allowing you to reconfigure, stop, and restart MongoDB
through the |mms| interface.

|mms| Automation can run only on 64-bit architectures.

What versions of MongoDB does |mms| manage?
-------------------------------------------

For specific |mms| functions and supported MongoDB versions, see
:doc:`/reference/mongodb-compatibility`.

What are the upgrade paths for |onprem| versions 1.8.x and 2.0.x?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For upgrade paths, see :doc:`Upgrade Ops Manager </tutorial/upgrade-ops-manager>`.

How does |mms| manage MongoDB deployments?
------------------------------------------

.. TODO This information should be incorporated into the main content
   of the manual and not hidden in an FAQ.

After you deploy the agent in the environment of the
MongoDB deployment, each agent periodically communicates with |mms|
and performs any required work.

Agents constantly reassess their environment to adapt their work as
necessary. As part of this routine activity, the agent establishes
frequent short-lived connections to the cluster members. If an agent
encounters an issue, such as network connectivity problems or |mms|
failure, the agents adjust their work to compensate and safely arrive at
their goal state.

Agents create plans to move from their current state to a goal state.
Plans execute in steps, where each step is autonomous and independent
of other steps.

.. example::

   For an installation, the plan involves downloading MongoDB, starting
   the process with the appropriate command line options, initializing
   the replica set, waiting for a healthy majority. The configuration
   reaches goal state when the replica set is active and has a healthy
   majority.

.. _rolling-restart-faq:

How does |mms| perform maintenance on cluster nodes?
----------------------------------------------------

|mms| performs a :opsmgr:`rolling restart </reference/glossary/#std-term-rolling-restart>` when you perform maintenance
on nodes in a cluster. The agent updates nodes in a cluster one-by-one,
always maintaining a primary node, until all nodes are updated to 
maintain cluster availability during a maintenance period.

For each secondary node in the cluster, the agent:

1. Restarts the |mongod| process running on the node in ``standalone`` 
   mode.
#. Performs the maintenance task.
#. Restarts the |mongod| process running on the node in ``replSet`` 
   mode.

After the secondary nodes are updated, the agent:

1. Steps the primary down using the :manual:`rs.stepDown() 
   </reference/method/rs.stepDown/>` command.
#. Triggers an election for a new primary node.
#. Performs the maintenance task on the former primary node.
#. Restarts the |mongod| process running on the former primary node in   
   ``replSet`` mode to join the cluster as a secondary node.

In |mms|, the agent performs rolling restarts on cluster nodes for 
maintenance tasks, including the following:

- Rotating |kmip| keys.
- Rotating keyfiles.
- Changing |mongod| configuration arguments.
- Upgrading or downgrading |tls|, ``auth``, or ``clusterAuth`` mode.
- Changing the MongoDB version.
- Changing the oplog size.
- Removing a process from a replica set.
- Cancelling a restore from backup.
- Enabling the Profiler

How many {+aagent+}s do I need?
-------------------------------------

To use Automation, you must have an agent running on every host where
a managed MongoDB instance runs.

Is any MongoDB data transferred by the agent?
---------------------------------------------

Agents do *not* transmit any data records from a MongoDB deployment.
The agents only communicate deployment configuration information and
MongoDB logs.

Will |mms| handle failures during an upgrade?
---------------------------------------------

Generally speaking, yes. The design of the management and automation
components of |mms| do not account for *all* possible failures; however
the architecture of the system can work around many types of failures.
