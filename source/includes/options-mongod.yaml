   The maximum number of connections that can exist in the listen
   queue.

   .. warning ::

      Consult your local system's documentation to understand the
      limitations and configuration requirements before using this
      parameter.

   .. important::

      To prevent undefined behavior, specify a value for this
      parameter between ``1`` and the local system ``SOMAXCONN``
      constant.

   The default value for the ``listenBacklog`` parameter is set at
   compile time to the target system ``SOMAXCONN`` constant.
   ``SOMAXCONN`` is the maximum valid value that is documented for
   the *backlog* parameter to the *listen* system call.

   Some systems may interpret ``SOMAXCONN`` symbolically, and others
   numerically. The actual *listen backlog* applied in practice may
   differ from any numeric interpretation of the ``SOMAXCONN`` constant
   or argument to ``--listenBacklog``, and may also be constrained by
   system settings like ``net.core.somaxconn`` on Linux.

   Passing a value for the ``listenBacklog`` parameter that exceeds the
   ``SOMAXCONN`` constant for the local system is, by the letter of the
   standards, undefined behavior. Higher values may be silently integer
   truncated, may be ignored, may cause unexpected resource
   consumption, or have other adverse consequences.

   On systems with workloads that exhibit connection spikes, for which
   it is empirically known that the local system can honor higher
   values for the *backlog* parameter than the ``SOMAXCONN`` constant,
   setting the ``listenBacklog`` parameter to a higher value may reduce
   operation latency as observed by the client by reducing the number
   of connections which are forced into a backoff state.

  - Specifying an unrecognized protocol will prevent the server from
    starting.

  - The specified disabled protocols overrides any default disabled
    protocols.

  Prevents a MongoDB server running with TLS from accepting
  incoming connections that use a specific protocol or protocols. To
  specify multiple protocols, use a comma separated list of protocols.
   
  {{role}} recognizes the following protocols: ``TLS1_0``, ``TLS1_1``,
  and ``TLS1_2``.

  - On macOS, you cannot disable ``TLS1_1`` and leave both ``TLS1_0`` and
    ``TLS1_2`` enabled. You must disable at least one of the other
    two, for example, ``TLS1_0,TLS1_1``.

  - To list multiple protocols, specify as a comma separated list of
    protocols. For example ``TLS1_0,TLS1_1``.

  - Specifying an unrecognized protocol will prevent the server from
    starting.

  - The specified disabled protocols overrides any default disabled
    protocols.

  Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB disables the use of TLS 1.0 if TLS
  1.1+ is available on the system. To enable the disabled TLS 1.0,
  specify ``none`` to {{role}}. :ref:`4.0-disable-tls`

   For MongoDB 4.0.3+ and 3.6.1+, you can disable read concern
   :readconcern:`"majority"` to prevent the storage cache pressure from
   immobilizing a deployment with a three-member
   primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture. For more information
   about disabling read concern :readconcern:`"majority"`, see
   :ref:`4.0-disable-read-concern-majority`.

   To disable, set {{role}} to false.

   .. important::

      In general, avoid disabling :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern
      unless necessary. However, if you have a three-member replica set
      with a primary-secondary-arbiter (PSA) architecture or a sharded
      cluster with a three-member PSA shards, disable to prevent the
      storage cache pressure from immobilizing the deployment.

      Disabling :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern disables support
      for :doc:`/changeStreams`.

      Disabling :readconcern:`"majority"` does not affect
      :doc:`multi-document transactions </core/transactions>`; i.e. you
      can specify read concern "majority" for multi-document
      transactions even if read concern "majority" is disabled.

     Allows the {{program}} to accept and create authenticated and
     non-authenticated connections to and from other :binary:`~bin.mongod`
     and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances in the deployment. Used for
     performing rolling transition of replica sets or sharded clusters
     from a no-auth configuration to :ref:`internal authentication
     <inter-process-auth>`. Requires specifying a :ref:`internal
     authentication <inter-process-auth>` mechanism such as
     {{option}}.

  For example, if using :ref:`keyfiles <internal-auth-keyfile>` for
  :ref:`internal authentication <inter-process-auth>`, the {{program}} creates
  an authenticated connection with any :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`
  in the deployment using a matching keyfile. If the security mechanisms do
  not match, the {{program}} utilizes a non-authenticated connection instead.

  A {{program}} running with {{role}} does not enforce :ref:`user access
  controls <authorization>`. Users may connect to your deployment without any
  access control checks and perform read, write, and administrative operations.

  .. note::

     A {{program}} running with :ref:`internal authentication
     <inter-process-auth>` and *without* {{role}} requires clients to connect
     using :ref:`user access controls <authorization>`. Update clients to

  .. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

  A {{program}} running with {{role}} redacts any message accompanying a given
  log event before logging. This prevents the {{program}} from writing
  potentially sensitive data stored on the database to the diagnostic log.
  Metadata such as error or operation codes, line numbers, and source file
  names are still visible in the logs.

  Use {{role}} in conjunction with
  :doc:`/core/security-encryption-at-rest` and
  :doc:`/core/security-transport-encryption` to assist compliance with
  regulatory requirements.

  For example, a MongoDB deployment might store Personally Identifiable
  Information (PII) in one or more collections. The {{program}} logs events
  such as those related to CRUD operations, sharding metadata, etc. It is
  possible that the {{program}} may expose PII as a part of these logging
  operations. A {{program}} running with {{role}} removes any message
  accompanying these events before being output to the log, effectively
  removing the PII.

  Diagnostics on a {{program}} running with {{role}} may be more difficult
  due to the lack of data related to a log event. See the
  :ref:`process logging <monitoring-log-redaction>` manual page for an
  example of the effect of {{role}} on log output.

  You can enable or disable log redaction on a running {{program}}
  using the :dbcommand:`setParameter` database command.

  A comma-separated list of SASL mechanisms {{program}} can
  use when authenticating to the LDAP server. The {{program}} and the
  LDAP server must agree on at least one mechanism. The {{program}}
  dynamically loads any SASL mechanism libraries installed on the host
  machine at runtime.

  Install and configure the appropriate libraries for the selected
  SASL mechanism(s) on both the {{program}} host and the remote
  LDAP server host. Your operating system may include certain SASL
  libraries by default. Defer to the documentation associated with each
  SASL mechanism for guidance on installation and configuration.

  If using the ``GSSAPI`` SASL mechanism for use with
  :ref:`security-kerberos`, verify the following for the
  {{program}} host machine:

  ``Linux``
    - The ``KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME`` environment
      variable resolves to the name of the client :ref:`keytab-files`
      for the host machine. For more on Kerberos environment
      variables, please defer to the
      `Kerberos documentation <https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.13/doc/admin/env_variables.html>`__.
    - The client keytab includes a
      :ref:`kerberos-user-principal` for the {{program}} to use when
      connecting to the LDAP server and execute LDAP queries.

  ``Windows``
    If connecting to an Active Directory server, the Windows
    Kerberos configuration automatically generates a
    `Ticket-Granting-Ticket <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380510(v=vs.85).aspx>`__
    when the user logs onto the system. Set {{useOSDefaults}} to
    ``true`` to allow {{program}} to use the generated credentials when
    connecting to the Active Directory server and execute queries.

  Set {{bindMethod}} to ``sasl`` to use this option.

  .. note::

     For a complete list of SASL mechanisms see the

  ``libldap`` dependency. See the documentation for ``TLS Options`` in the
  `ldap.conf OpenLDAP documentation
  <http://www.openldap.org/software/man.cgi?query=ldap.conf&manpath=OpenLDAP+2.4-Release>`_
  for more complete instructions.

  For Windows deployment, you must add the LDAP server CA certificates to the
  Windows certificate management tool. The exact name and functionality of the
  tool may vary depending on operating system version. Please see the
  documentation for your version of Windows for more information on
  certificate management.

  Set {{role}} to ``none`` to disable TLS/SSL between {{program}} and the LDAP

description: |
  .. versionadded:: 3.4 Available in MongoDB Enterprise only.

  Maps the username provided to {{program}} for authentication to a LDAP
  Distinguished Name (DN). You may need to use {{role}} to transform a
  username into an LDAP DN in the following scenarios:

  - Performing LDAP authentication with simple LDAP binding, where users
    authenticate to MongoDB with usernames that are not full LDAP DNs.

  - Using an :option:`LDAP authorization query template
    <mongod --ldapAuthzQueryTemplate>` that requires a DN.

  - Transforming the usernames of clients authenticating to Mongo DB using
    different authentication mechanisms (e.g. x.509, kerberos) to a full LDAP
    DN for authorization.

  {{role}} expects a quote-enclosed JSON-string representing an ordered array
  of documents. Each document contains a regular expression ``match`` and
  either a ``substitution`` or ``ldapQuery`` template used for transforming the
  incoming username.

  Each document in the array has the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       match: "<regex>"
       substitution: "<LDAP DN>" | ldapQuery: "<LDAP Query>"
     }

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 70 20

     * - Field
       - Description
       - Example

     * - ``match``
       - An ECMAScript-formatted regular expression (regex) to match against a
         provided username. Each parenthesis-enclosed section represents a
         regex capture group used by ``substitution`` or ``ldapQuery``.
       - ``"(.+)ENGINEERING"``
         ``"(.+)DBA"``

     * - ``substitution``

       - An LDAP distinguished name (DN) formatting template that converts the
         authentication name matched by the ``match`` regex into a LDAP DN.
         Each curly bracket-enclosed numeric value is replaced by the
         corresponding `regex capture group
         <http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html>`_ extracted
         from the authentication username via the ``match`` regex.
         
         The result of the substitution must be an `RFC4514
         <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt>`_ escaped string.

       - ``"cn={0},ou=engineering,
         dc=example,dc=com"``

     * - ``ldapQuery``

       - A LDAP query formatting template that inserts the authentication
         name matched by the ``match`` regex into an LDAP query URI encoded
         respecting RFC4515 and RFC4516. Each curly bracket-enclosed numeric
         value is replaced by the corresponding `regex capture group
         <http://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html>`_ extracted
         from the authentication username via the ``match`` expression.
         {{program}} executes the query against the LDAP server to retrieve
         the LDAP DN for the authenticated user. {{program}} requires
         exactly one returned result for the transformation to be
         successful, or {{program}} skips this transformation.

       - ``"ou=engineering,dc=example,
         dc=com??one?(user={0})"``

  .. note::

     An explanation of  `RFC4514 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt>`_,
     `RFC4515 <https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4515>`_,
     `RFC4516 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4516>`_, or LDAP queries is out
     of scope for the MongoDB Documentation. Please review the RFC directly or
     use your preferred LDAP resource.

  For each document in the array, you must use either ``substitution`` or
  ``ldapQuery``. You *cannot* specify both in the same document.

  When performing authentication or authorization, {{program}} steps through
  each document in the array in the given order, checking the authentication
  username against the ``match`` filter.  If a match is found,
  {{program}} applies the transformation and uses the output for
  authenticating the user. {{program}} does not check the remaining documents
  in the array.

  If the given document does not match the provided authentication name, or
  the transformation described by the document fails, {{program}} continues
  through the list of documents to find additional matches. If no matches are
  found in any document, {{program}} returns an error.

  .. example::

    The following shows two transformation documents. The first
    document matches against any string ending in ``@ENGINEERING``, placing
    anything preceeding the suffix into a regex capture group. The
    second document matches against any string ending in ``@DBA``, placing
    anything preceeding the suffix into a regex capture group.

    .. important::  You must pass the array to {{role}} as a string.

    .. code-block:: text

       "[
          {
             match: "(.+)@ENGINEERING.EXAMPLE.COM",
             substitution: "cn={0},ou=engineering,dc=example,dc=com"
          },
          {
             match: "(.+)@DBA.EXAMPLE.COM",
             ldapQuery: "ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com??one?(user={0})"

          }

       ]"

    A user with username ``alice@ENGINEERING.EXAMPLE.COM`` matches the first
    document. The regex capture group ``{0}`` corresponds to the string
    ``alice``. The resulting output is the DN
    ``"cn=alice,ou=engineering,dc=example,dc=com"``.

    A user with username ``bob@DBA.EXAMPLE.COM`` matches the second document.
    The regex capture group ``{0}`` corresponds to the string ``bob``.  The
    resulting output is the LDAP query
    ``"ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com??one?(user=bob)"``. {{program}} executes this
    query against the LDAP server, returning the result
    ``"cn=bob,ou=dba,dc=example,dc=com"``.

  If {{role}} is unset, {{program}} applies no transformations to the username
  when attempting to authenticate or authorize a user against the LDAP server.

  This setting can be configured on a running {{program}} using the
  :dbcommand:`setParameter` database command.

  A relative LDAP query URL formatted conforming to `RFC4515
  <https://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4515>`_ and `RFC4516
  <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4516>`_ that {{program}} executes to obtain
  the LDAP groups to which the authenticated user belongs to. The query is
  relative to the host or hosts specified in {{ldapServers}}.

  Use the ``{USER}`` placeholder in the URL to substitute the authenticated
  username, or the transformed username if a {{mapping}} is specified.

  When constructing the query URL, ensure that the order of LDAP parameters
  respects RFC4516:

  .. code-block:: shell

    [ dn  [ ? [attributes] [ ? [scope] [ ? [filter] [ ? [Extensions] ] ] ] ] ]

  If your query includes an attribute, {{program}} assumes that the query
  retrieves a the DNs which this entity is member of.

  If your query does not include an attribute, {{program}} assumes
  the query retrieves all entities which the user is member of.

  For each LDAP DN returned by the query, {{program}} assigns the authorized
  user a corresponding role on the ``admin`` database. If a role on the on the
  ``admin`` database exactly matches the DN, {{program}} grants the user the
  roles and privileges assigned to that role. See the
  :method:`db.createRole()` method for more information on creating roles.

  .. example::

    This LDAP query returns any groups listed in the LDAP user object's
    ``memberOf`` attribute.

    .. code-block:: shell

       "{USER}?memberOf?base"

    Your LDAP configuration may not include the ``memberOf`` attribute as part
    of the user schema, may possess a different attribute for reporting group
    membership, or may not track group membership through attributes.
    Configure your query with respect to your own unique LDAP configuration.

  If unset, {{program}} cannot authorize users using LDAP.
