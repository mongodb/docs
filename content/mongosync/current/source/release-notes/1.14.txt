1.14.0 Release
--------------

**June 5, 2025**

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adds the ``estimatedSecondsToCEACatchup`` field to the :ref:`c2c-api-progress`
  endpoint response.

- ``mongosync`` errors on indexes that are inconsistent or missing on 
  some data-bearing shards, instead of ignoring them.

- Adds the ``"excludeHashed"`` option to the ``buildIndexes`` parameter in
  the :ref:`c2c-api-start` endpoint.

Live Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Live upgrades <c2c-live-upgrade>` to 1.14 are not
supported.

Fixed Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes a bug where ``mongosync`` exited during :ref:`collection copy 
  <c2c-collection-copy>` upon seeing a transient error. Now, ``mongosync``
  will retry on retryable errors.

- Fixes a bug where the embedded verifier could have caused
  long downtime during :ref:`c2c-api-commit` if the source 
  cluster has a lot of unique or hidden indexes.

Other Notes 
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixes a case where ``mongosync`` exited unexpectedly without printing
  a fatal log error. Now, if ``mongosync`` exits unexpectedly, it prints
  a log error.

- Fixes a bug introduced in ``mongosync`` version 1.10 where the 
  :ref:`c2c-api-progress` endpoint overcounted the verifier's 
  ``estimatedDocumentCount``.

- If the verifier finds checksum mismatches, it might re-fetch some
  documents from the source or destination cluster to check if the mismatch
  is due to differences in `field order <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/document/#document-field-order>`__.
  This might lead to cutover taking slightly longer.
