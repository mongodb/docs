to transform user experiences.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

To bring a smarter in-car assistant to life, we designed an architecture
that blends cloud and edge technologies into one seamless experience. At
the heart of it is MongoDB Atlas, which acts as the data layer, paired
with Google Cloud’s AI capabilities. This architecture ensures fast,
personalized, and reliable interactions.

Let’s break down how it works.

On-board Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These run in the vehicle, close to the driver, and enable real-time
voice interaction.

- **Car console:** The in-car interface where users speak to the assistant
  and get responses. It’s a web app in this demo, but represents the
  embedded system in a real vehicle.

- **Local data storage:** Vehicles store key signals locally using
  PowerSync SDK, a lightweight edge database built on SQLite. This ensures
  fast access to diagnostic data and keeps data synced with MongoDB Atlas.

- **Assistant backend:** This component manages the conversation. It
  handles voice transcription using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and reads
  the driver’s intent. Depending on the query, it may respond directly or
  call tools to fetch more data or take action. For the demo version, we
  included four sample tools: 
  
  - Consult manual: Uses Atlas Vector Search to retrieve relevant info
    from the car manual. 

  - Run diagnostics: Fetches current diagnostic codes from local vehicle
    data. 
    
  - Recalculate route: Adjusts the trip if the driver adds a stop. 
  
  - Close chat: Ends the conversation gracefully.

               },  
             },  
             required: ["query"],  
           },  
         },

             properties: {},  
           },  
         },  
       ],  
     },  
   ]; 

Cloud Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These provide AI intelligence, scalable storage, and data processing
capabilities.

- **Data ingestion:** Unstructured content like car manuals is uploaded
  to Google Cloud Storage. This triggers a pipeline using Pub/Sub, Cloud
  Run, and Document AI to split the PDFs into chunks. Vertex AI generates
  embeddings for these chunks, which are then stored in MongoDB Atlas for
  semantic search. 

- **Serving speech APIs:** Google Cloud’s Text-to-Speech and
  Speech-to-Text handle natural voice interaction. Vertex AI: Provides
  text embeddings for search queries and powers the LLM (Gemini) used by
  the assistant.

- **Data storage and retrieval:** MongoDB Atlas stores:
  
  - Manual chunk embeddings for retrieval via Atlas Vector Search.

  - User preferences and session data.

  - Vehicle signals—both latest values and full time series telemetry.

Atlas Vector Search is used to match user questions with the most
relevant manual sections, enabling a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) flow. MongoDB’s native support for structured, semi-structured,
and vector data in one place simplifies the assistant logic and speeds
up development.

- **Data sync:** We use PowerSync for two-way sync between the vehicle
  and cloud: 
  
  - Vehicle to cloud: Vehicle sends telemetry data like diagnostic
    codes, speed, or acceleration. A cloud run function processes
    and stores this in Atlas. 

  - Cloud to vehicle: Enables updates or actions sent remotely to the
    car—like OTA updates or remote locking.

The Role of MongoDB in Conversational AI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Atlas is the developer data platform that powers this solution.
Here's how it improves the architecture:

- **Unifies operational and vector data:** Vehicle signals, vector
  embeddings, and user sessions are stored together in a single,
  consistent platform. 

- **Enables more relevant responses:** Atlas Vector Search retrieves the
  right chunks from large documents instantly, fueling accurate and
  context-rich responses. 

- **Built for the enterprise scale:** Whether it's one model or a global
  fleet, MongoDB Atlas offers built-in horizontal scalability,
  high-availability and enterprise-grade security. 

- **Simplifies edge and cloud sync:** PowerSync and MongoDB work together to
  bridge in-car and cloud environments without friction.

This architecture is designed to scale, evolve, and adapt—just like the
vehicles it supports. With MongoDB at the core, automakers can focus
less on data plumbing and more on delivering smart, helpful in-car
experiences that truly make a difference on the road.

Data Model Approach
-------------------

Data is at the heart of any AI-powered experience. The quality,
structure, and accessibility of your data are what make or break the
experience. In this solution, MongoDB’s document model plays a central
role—enabling flexibility, speed, and scale for developers building
intelligent in-car assistants.

Unlike traditional relational databases that rely on rigid tables and
complex joins, MongoDB stores data as flexible documents. This makes it
easier to represent real-world data structures, like vehicle telemetry
or embedded knowledge chunks, exactly as they are used in code. It also
means you can iterate faster, adapt your model without downtime, and
build new capabilities as your application evolves.

Built for Innovation and Speed 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The document model is designed for how developers think. Need to add
metadata to your diagnostic data? Or associate multiple content types
with a single manual section? In MongoDB, that’s just a few lines of
code—not a schema rewrite. And because each document is self-contained,
queries are faster and simpler. Fewer joins, fewer moving parts, and
more time to build.

This flexibility also unlocks faster innovation cycles. As new vehicle
features roll out or user expectations shift, teams can evolve the data
model on the fly without expensive migrations or app downtime.

The Natural Choice for AI Workloads 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generative AI thrives on rich, diverse, and unstructured data.
Embeddings, contextual metadata, structured references—all of it plays a
part in making AI systems smarter. MongoDB is uniquely suited for these
kinds of applications: 

- Store vector embeddings, metadata, and source content in a single
  document. 

- Combine structured and vector data without jumping between systems. 

- Query vector and non-vector fields together for contextual, accurate
  results.

The result? Simpler architecture, better performance, and more relevant
AI responses.

Example 1: Car Manual Embeddings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, the quality
of the chunking and embeddings directly impacts the quality of the AI’s
responses. Poorly segmented content or missing context can lead to vague
or inaccurate answers. Technical manuals are inherently complex. They
often contain dense text, diagrams, and domain-specific
terminology—making it challenging to retrieve the right information.

To address this, we represent each chunk of the manual as a document.
The document includes not just the text and its vector embedding, but
also metadata such as content type (e.g., safety, diagnostics), page
numbers, chunk length, and links to related chunks. This additional
context helps the system understand how pieces of information relate to
one another—especially important in highly technical or interdependent
topics.

MongoDB’s flexible document model makes it straightforward to capture
this complexity. As the manual evolves or as new needs emerge, we can
incrementally add fields or adjust structure without requiring a full
schema migration. This enables more precise retrieval and ultimately
more helpful AI responses.

     ],  
     "embedding_timestamp": "2025-03-08T13:50:00.887107"  
   }  

Example 2: Vehicle Signal Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For vehicle signals, we modeled our data using the COVESA Vehicle Signal
Specification (VSS). VSS provides a standardized, hierarchical structure
to describe real-time signals—like speed, acceleration, or diagnostic
trouble codes (DTCs). It’s an open, extensible format that enables
easier collaboration, system integration, and data reuse across vehicle
platforms.

MongoDB document model natively handles nested structures, representing
the VSS hierarchy is straightforward. Signals can be grouped logically,
just like they appear in the VSS model, which aligns perfectly with the
tree-based structure of the spec.

.. figure:: /includes/images/industry-solutions/car-assistant-vss.svg

   :alt: Reference architecture for car assistant solution
   
   Figure 3. The VSS data model is a hierarchical tree structure built with modules that can be flexibly combined. 
   Source: https://covesa.global/vehicle-signal-specification/ 

This structure not only accelerates development but also ensures that AI
tools and workflows have consistent access to clean, structured, and
meaningful data.

.. code-block:: javascript  
   :copyable: true  
  
   {  
     "_id": {  
       "$oid": "67e58d5f672b23090e57d478"  
     },  
     "VehicleIdentification": {  
       "VIN": "1HGCM82633A004352"  
     },  
     "Speed": 0,  
     "TraveledDistance": 0,  
     "CurrentLocation": {  
       "Timestamp": "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",  
       "Latitude": 0,  
       "Longitude": 0,  
       "Altitude": 0  
     },  
     "Acceleration": {  
       "Lateral": 0,  
       "Longitudinal": 0,  
       "Vertical": 0  
     },  
     "Diagnostics": {  
       "DTCCount": 0,  
       "DTCList": []  
     }  
   }  

MongoDB’s document model doesn’t just store your data. It mirrors the
complexity of the real world—making it easier to build smarter systems
that respond in real time, adapt to user needs, and grow with your
platform. Whether you’re storing vehicle diagnostics or vector-encoded
manuals, MongoDB gives you the tools to build intelligent experiences
faster.

Building the Solution
---------------------

Building this solution can be broken down into five major steps. You’ll
use MongoDB Atlas to host your data, Google Cloud for AI services,
PowerSync to stream vehicle data, and a full-stack app to tie everything
together. You’ll find all required assets and resources inside the
`GitHub repository
<https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/genai-in-car-voice-assistant/tree/main>`__.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Replicate the demo database

      Provision a cluster within your `Atlas account
      <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register>`__ and populate
      your database with the data required for the demo. A data dump can
      be found inside the repository to quickly replicate the database
      with all the necessary data and metadata with one quick
      `mongorestore
      <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongorestore/>`__
      command.

   .. step:: Configure your Google Cloud environment

      Create a Google Cloud project and enable the required APIs:
      `Speech-to-Text <https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text>`__,
      `Text-to-Speech <https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech>`__,
      `Document AI <https://cloud.google.com/document-ai>`__, and
      `Vertex AI <https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai>`__. For local
      development, configure Application Default Credentials so the app
      can authenticate seamlessly with Google services. Detailed
      instructions are provided in the `Google Cloud documentation
      <https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials>`__.

   .. step:: (Optional) Create your own document embeddings

      The demo includes a precomputed set of embeddings for the car
      manual. However, you can generate your own embeddings by parsing
      PDF files using Document AI and embedding them with Vertex AI.
      This gives you flexibility to extend the assistant with custom
      documents or additional manuals as needed.

   .. step:: Configure PowerSync for real-time vehicle data

      Create a PowerSync account and link your MongoDB database using your
      connection string. PowerSync acts as a data bridge, syncing MongoDB data
      to client applications in real-time. Define sync rules for the
      *vehicleData* collection. 

   .. step:: Run the application

      Clone the repository locally and create a *.env* file using the template
      provided. Once your environment is configured, run *npm install* to
      install dependencies and then start the development server with *npm run
      dev*. The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.
