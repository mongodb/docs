You can combine {+avs+} and |fts| queries into a hybrid search for
unified results. 

This tutorial demonstrates how to run a hybrid search on the
``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` collection, which contains details 
about movies. Specifically, this tutorial takes you through the
following steps: 

1. Create a {+avs+} index on the ``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large`` field. This field
   contains vector embeddings that represent the summary of a movie's
   plot. 
#. Create a |fts| index on the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies``
   collection.   
#. Run a query to combine the results from a :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`
   query and a :pipeline:`$search` query by using the following
   techniques:
   
   - Semantic boosting 
   - Reciprocal rank fusion

Why Hybrid Search?
------------------

You can apply the following techniques to achieve a hybrid search:

   * - Technique 
     - **Semantic Boosting** 
     - **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** 

   * - Purpose 
     - Improves the accuracy of the full-text search results by
       boosting documents that match vector search. Useful when retrieving very large result sets. 
     - Combines results from different search methods into a single
       ranked result set by calculating the reciprocal rank of documents
       in the results. 

   * - Ranking Method
     - - Run :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` to retrieves semantically similar results.
       - Run :pipeline:`$search` to retrieve full-text results while boosting the
         documents that were returned by :pipeline:`$vectorSearch`. 

     - - Retrieves :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` and :pipeline:`$search` results.
       - Merges both sets of results using the rank of each document in
         the respective result sets. 

   * - Scoring Method
     - Boosts the full-text results score for documents that match the
       results from the vector search, by the weighted vector search
       score. 

     - Calculates the score by using the following formula:

       .. code-block:: shell 
          :copyable: false

          1.0/{document position in the results + constant value}

       Then, for each method of search, applies different weights (``w``) to
       give more importance to that method of search. For each document,
       the weighted reciprocal rank is calculated by multiplying the
       weight by the reciprocal rank of the document. 

       .. code-block:: shell 
          :copyable: false 

          weighted_reciprocal_rank = w x reciprocal_rank

   * - Search Features
     - - Supports :ref:`faceting <fts-facet-ref>` to group data into
         categories. 
       - Supports :ref:`paginating <fts-paginate-results>` results using
         ``searchAfter`` and ``searchBefore``. 

     - Supports further processing of results in subsequent aggregation
       stages such as :pipeline:`$group`.  

   * - Output 
     - Single result set that contains documents from :pipeline:`$search`
     - Single result set that contains documents from both search
       methods.  

Prerequisites 
-------------

Create the {+avs+} and |fts| Indexes 
-----------------------------------------------------------

This section demonstrates how to create the following indexes on the
fields in the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` collection: 

- a {+avs+} index on the ``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large`` field for running vector
  queries against that field. 
- a |fts| index on the ``title`` field for running full-text search
  against that field.

Semantic Boosting 
-----------------

This section demonstrates how to query the data in the
``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` collection for *star wars* in the
``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large`` and ``plot`` fields by using the
:pipeline:`$vectorSearch` and :pipeline:`$search` pipeline stages,
respectively. The query enhances relevancy of :pipeline:`$search`
queries  by boosting the full-text scores using
:pipeline:`$vectorSearch` scores for the same documents.

Reciprocal Rank Fusion
----------------------

This section demonstrates how to query the data in the
``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` collection for *star wars* in the
``plot_embedding_voyage_3_large`` and ``title`` fields by using the
:pipeline:`$vectorSearch` and :pipeline:`$search` pipeline stages and 
combine each document's scores from both stages to re-sort the documents
in the results. This ensures that documents appearing in both searches
appear at the top of the combined results.
