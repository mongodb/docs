In general, to create users for a sharded clusters, connect to the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` and add the sharded cluster users.

However, some maintenance operations require direct connections to
specific shards in a sharded cluster. To perform these operations, you
must connect directly to the shard and authenticate as a shard-local
administrative user.

Shard-local users exist only in the specific shard and should only be
used for shard-specific maintenance and configuration. You cannot
connect to the :binary:`~bin.mongos` with shard-local users.
