Couldn't load "librealm-jni.so"
-------------------------------

If your app uses native libraries that don't ship with support for
64-bit architectures, Android will fail to load Realm's
``librealm-jni.so`` file on ARM64 devices. This happens because Android
cannot load 32-bit and 64-bit native libraries concurrently. Ideally,
all libraries could provide the same set of supported ABIs, but
sometimes that may not be doable when using a 3rd-party library.

To work around this issue, you can exclude Realm's ARM64 library from
the APK file by adding the following code to the application's
``build.gradle``. You can refer to Mixing 32- and 64-bit Dependencies in Android for more information.

.. code-block:: gradle
   :copyable: false

   android {
       //...
       packagingOptions {
           exclude "lib/arm64-v8a/librealm-jni.so"
       }
       //...
   }

Network Calls to Mixpanel
-------------------------

Realm collects anonymous analytics when you run the
Realm bytecode transformer on your source code. This is
completely anonymous and helps us improve the product by flagging:

- which version of the SDK you use
- which operating system you use
- if your application uses Kotlin
- if your application uses local-only Realm or Sync

Analytics do not run when your application runs on user devices - only
when you compile your source code. To opt out of analytics, you can set
the ``REALM_DISABLE_ANALYTICS`` environment variable to ``true``.

.. _java-client-notifications-android-12:

Change Listeners in Android 12 with SDK Versions Below 10.5.1
-------------------------------------------------------------

Due to a change in the Linux kernel,
:ref:`object, collection, and realm notifications
<java-client-notifications>` do not work in SDK versions below
10.5.1 on devices running certain early versions of
Android 12.

This change effects Linux kernel versions beginning with ``5.5``.
Linux kernel version ``5.14-rc4`` fixed the issue. The fix was
also backported to ``LTS 5.10.56`` and ``LTS 5.13.8``. All mainline
and LTS Android 12 branches contain the fix or a backport of it.

If you experience this issue, you can restore notification functionality
with the following fixes:

- upgrade to a version of the SDK later than 10.5.1.
- upgrade to a version of Android 12 that uses a Linux kernel release
  that contains the fix (kernel commit ``3a34b13a88caeb2800ab44a4918f230041b37dd9``)
  or the backport of the fix (kernel commit ``4b20d2de0b367bca627b49efd8d2e9e01bb66753``).

Configurations Cannot be Different if Used to Open the Same File
----------------------------------------------------------------

Realm runs checks whenever you open a realm file to
avoid corruption. In order to avoid accidentally opening a realm
file with incompatible settings, the SDK uses Java's ``equals()`` method
to compare ``RealmConfiguration`` objects. This prevents the SDK from
opening a single realm file with different schemas, durability levels,
or writability settings. However, configurations that include lambda
functions, such as those passed to
:java-sdk:`initialData() <io/realm/RealmConfiguration.Builder.html#initialData-io.realm.Realm.Transaction->`
and
:java-sdk:`compactOnLaunch() <io/realm/RealmConfiguration.Builder.html#compactOnLaunch-io.realm.CompactOnLaunchCallback->`,
can break this ``equals()`` comparison, since two different lambdas are
never considered equal using Java's built-in comparison.
To avoid this error when using lambdas, you can either:

1. Store a single configuration statically in your application, so that
   separate realm instances use the exact same
   ``RealmConfiguration`` object and it passes the check.

#. Override the default equals check of the ``RealmConfiguration``:

   .. code-block:: kotlin
      :copyable: false

      val config = RealmConfiguration.Builder()
           .initialData(object: Realm.Transaction {
               override fun execute(realm: Realm) {
                   TODO("Not yet implemented")
               }

               override fun equals(other: Any?): Boolean {
                   return true
               }

               override fun hashCode(): Int {
                   return 37
               }
           }).build()

Kapt Exceptions During Builds
-----------------------------

If you experience an exception in the Kapt library with a description
like the following:

.. code-block::

   A failure occurred while executing org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.internal.KaptWithoutKotlincTask$KaptExecutionWorkAction

This most likely means there is an issue with one of your model classes.
Possible causes include:

- introducing a field type that is not :ref:`supported <java-field-types>` by the SDK
- using a visibility type other than ``open`` or ``public`` for a realm object model class
- using a Realm annotation on an incompatible field

If you experience this error, check any recent updates to your schema for
problems.

Installation Size
-----------------

Once your app is built for release and split for distribution, the SDK
should only add about 800KB to your APK in most cases. The releases are
significantly larger because they include support for more architectures,
such as ARM7, ARMv7, ARM64, x86, and MIPS. The APK file contains all
supported architectures, but the Android installer only installs native
code for the device's architecture. This means that the installed app
is smaller than the size of the APK file.

You can reduce the size of the Android APK itself by splitting the APK
into a version for each architecture. Use the Android Build Tool ABI
Split support by adding the following to your :file:`build.gradle`:

.. code-block:: gradle

   android {
       splits {
           abi {
               enable true
               reset()
               include 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a', 'x86', 'x86_64'
           }
       }
   }

Select the architectures that you'd like to include to build a separate
APK for each.

.. seealso::

   See the :android:`Android Tools documentation about ABI Splits
   <studio/build/configure-apk-splits.html>`
   for more information, or the :github:`example on GitHub
   <realm/realm-java/tree/master/examples/gridViewExample>`.

If you don't want to handle multiple APKs, you can restrict the number
of architectures supported in a single APK. This is done by adding
``abiFilters`` to your :file:`build.gradle`:

.. code-block:: gradle

   android {
       defaultConfig {
           ndk {
               abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a', 'mips', 'x86', 'x86_64'
           }
       }
   }

Customize Dependecies Defined by the Realm Gradle Plugin
--------------------------------------------------------

Realm uses a Gradle plugin because it makes it easier to set
up a large number of dependencies. Unfortunately this also makes it a
bit harder to ignore specific transitive dependencies.

If you want to customize Realm beyond what is exposed by the
plugin, you can manually set up all the dependencies and ignore the
Gradle plugin. The following example demonstrates how to set up the SDK
for an Android application using Kotlin manually:

.. code-block:: gradle

   buildscript {
       ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.21'
       ext.realm_version = '{+java-sdk-version+}'
       repositories {
           jcenter()
           mavenCentral()
       }
       dependencies {
           classpath "io.realm:realm-transformer:$realm_version"
           classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
       }
   }

   apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
   apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'
   apply plugin: 'kotlin-kapt'

   import io.realm.transformer.RealmTransformer
   android.registerTransform(new RealmTransformer(project))

   dependencies {
     api "io.realm:realm-annotations:$realm_version"
     api "io.realm:realm-android-library:$realm_version"
     api "io.realm:realm-android-kotlin-extensions:$realm_version"
     kapt "io.realm:realm-annotations-processor:$realm_version"
   }
