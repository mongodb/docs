To create a |multi-cluster|, you can:

- :ref:`Use the Quick Start <multi-cluster-quick-start-ref>`, to deploy a
  MongoDB replica set across three |k8s| member clusters, using |gke|
  and a service mesh.

- :ref:`Deploy a MongoDBMultiCluster Resource <multi-cluster-deploy-replica-set>`
  on each of the member clusters. This allows you to set different settings
  for the replica set resource, such as overrides for statefulSet configuration.

Both methods of creating a |multi-cluster| rely on the following services,
tools, and their documentation:

- |k8s| clusters. The procedures use |gke| to provision multiple |k8s|
  clusters. Each |k8s| member cluster hosts a MongoDB replica set deployment
  and represents a data center that serves your application.

- :github:`MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator repository
  </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes>` with configuration files that
  the |k8s-op-short| needs to deploy a |k8s| cluster.

- :mdb-github:`MongoDB Helm Charts for Kubernetes </helm-charts>` with
  charts for |multi-clusters|.

- |istio| service mesh. The quick start procedure uses |istio| to facilitate
  `DNS resolution <https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/configuration/traffic-management/dns-proxy/>`__
  for MongoDB replica sets deployed in different |k8s| clusters.
  You can use another service mesh solution as long as you ensure that
  cross-cluster service FQDNs are resolvable.

- :ref:`MongoDB kubectl plugin <kubectl-plugin-ref>` that sets up
  |multi-clusters| and allows you to run automatic and manual
  :ref:`disaster recovery <disaster-recovery-ref>`. To learn more,
  see the :ref:`kubectl-plugin-ref`.
