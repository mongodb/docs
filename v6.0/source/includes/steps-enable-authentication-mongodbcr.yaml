  You can enable more than one authentication mechanism for your MongoDB
  deployment, but the |mms| Agents can only use *one* authentication
  mechanism.

  In the :guilabel:`MongoDB Agent Connections to Deployment` section,
  select {{mechanism}} and/or {{mechanism2}}.

  |mms| automatically generates the Agents' usernames and passwords.
  
  |mms| creates users for the agents with the required user roles in
  the admin database for each existing deployment in |mms|. When you
  add a new deployment, |mms| creates the required users in the new
  deployment.
