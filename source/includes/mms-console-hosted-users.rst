You can grant users access to your group in the "Users" section of
the MMS console. Click on the ``+ ADD USER`` icon next 
to your account name and enter their email in the dialogue.  
If the console finds a
connected account, MMS will automatically add the user to the MMS
console.

.. note::

   With MongoDB Management Service On-Prem, user accounts and groups are
   independent from JIRA. This is in contrast to the `MongoDB Management Service
   <http://mms.mongodb.com>`_, which shares account
   and group information with the `MongoDB JIRA
   <http://jira.mongodb.org/>`_ instance.

Users can create accounts at any time using the account registration
page of your MMS installation.
