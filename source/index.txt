   :class: note

   :doc:`Queryable Backup <query-backup>` is available as a Beta
   feature.

`MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com?jmp=docs>`_ is a cloud
service for running, monitoring, and maintaining MongoDB deployments,
including the provisioning of dedicated servers for the MongoDB
instances.

MongoDB Deployments
-------------------

MongoDB deployments, or "clusters" in |service|, can be either a
:term:`replica set` or a :term:`sharded cluster`. 

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-mongodb-version.rst

|service| deploys each cluster across a minimum of three availability
zones and with mandatory :ref:`security <overview-security>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-aws-instance.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-auto-index.rst

|service| Group
---------------

Your |service| group manages your MongoDB deployments. An |service|
group can have multiple MongoDB clusters.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-vpc-per-group.rst

.. _overview-security:

Security
--------

|service| secures your deployments through the use of :ref:`TLS/SSL
<security-tls>`, :ref:`virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet
<security-vpc>` with :ref:`IP whitelists <add-to-whitelist>`, and
:ref:`user authentication and authorization <mongodb-users>`.

Support
-------

|service| provides support for the use of the service itself. Support
for development and performance of the database itself requires a
MongoDB subscription. For details, `contact MongoDB Inc.
<https://www.mongodb.com/contact?jmp=docs>`_.

Next Steps
----------

To get started, see :doc:`getting-started`.
