The configuration options available for creating a condition vary
based on:

- Chart type

- *Effective type* of the value to which you you want to apply the 
  condition

The effective type of a value is its type after array reductions 
and aggregations. For example, a string field in a table's 
:guilabel:`Values` channel with a ``COUNT`` aggregation becomes numeric.

:guilabel:`Applies to` Field
----------------------------

Use the :guilabel:`Applies to` menu to select the aspect of your chart 
to which to you want to apply formatting based on a condition.

For :ref:`Number Charts <number-chart-ref>`, you can only apply 
conditions to the number.

For :ref:`Data Tables <data-table-ref>`, you can select:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Applies to
     - Description

   * - Groups
     - Select a group :ref:`encoding channel <encoding-channels>` from 
       your chart. The effective type of the field you select 
       determines the available :guilabel:`Operators`.

       |charts-short| formats matching cells in that group field column.

   * - Values
     - Select a value :ref:`encoding channel <encoding-channels>` from 
       your chart. The effective type of the field you select 
       determines the available :guilabel:`Operators`.

       |charts-short| formats matching cells in that value field column.

   * - Row Index
     - Compare a number to 0-based row indexes (that is, the first 
       row of data is row ``0``).

       |charts-short| formats matching rows.

   * - Column Name
     - Compare a string to column headings.

       |charts-short| formats matching columns.

   * - Cell Value
     - Compare a number or string to any table cell value.

       |charts-short| formats any matching cell.

   * - Row Total
     - Compare a number to 
       :ref:`row totals <toggle-row-column-totals>`.

       |charts-short| formats matching row total cells.

   * - Column Total
     - Compare a number to column totals.

       |charts-short| formats matching column total cells.

:guilabel:`Operator` Field
--------------------------

Use the :guilabel:`Operator` menu to select the operator that the
condition uses to determine formatting. Depending on the type of 
value you selected from the :guilabel:`Applies to` menu, you can 
choose from numeric, string, or date operators.

Charts uses the selected operator to compare chart values 
included in the :guilabel:`Applies to` field to an 
:ref:`input <conditional-formatting-input>` you provide.

You can only select numeric operators for
:ref:`Number Charts <number-chart-ref>`.

Numeric Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For individual numeric values, the following operators are available:

- Equal to
- Not equal to
- Greater than
- Greater than or equal to
- Less than
- Less than or equal to

On Data Tables, the following ranking operators are also available:

- Ranked in top
- Ranked in bottom
- Ranked in top percent
- Ranked in bottom percent

.. note:: Ranking identical values

   If multiple, identical values extend outside of the specified 
   ranking, |charts| formats all matching values. For example, if the 
   top 20 values in your table are identical and you choose to format 
   the top 10, |charts-short| formats all 20 identical values.

Date Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For individual date values, the following operators are available:

- On or after
- After
- Exactly
- Before
- On or before

Binned Numbers and Dates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Binned <charts-bin-data>` numbers and dates use 
different operators that apply to the bin range.

For binned number ranges, the following operators are available:

- Includes
- Greater than
- Greater than or includes
- Less than
- Less than or includes

For binned date ranges, the following operators are available:

- Includes
- After
- After or includes
- Before
- Before or includes

String Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For string values, the following operators are available:

- Equal to
- Not equal to
- Empty
- Not empty
- Contains
- Does not contain
- Starts with
- Matches Regex
- One of

Matches Regex
``````````````

If you select *Matches Regex*, you can apply any number of the 
following Regex flags:

- Case insensitive (i)
- Multiline (m)
- Extended (x)
- Single line (s)

Use the :ref:`input <conditional-formatting-input>` field to specify a 
regular expression.

One of
``````

If you select *One of*, use the 
:ref:`input <conditional-formatting-input>` field to list a series of 
strings. Matching any string in that list applies your conditional 
formatting.

.. _conditional-formatting-input:

:guilabel:`Input` Field
-----------------------

The :guilabel:`Input` field specifies a value to use for evaluating 
your :guilabel:`Operator` condition against the values from your 
:guilabel:`Applies to` field.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Type of Operator
     - Type of Input

   * - Numeric
     - ``double``

   * - String
     - ``string``

       If you selected the *Matches Regex* string operator, 
       enter a regular expression.

       If you selected the *One of* string operator, 
       enter a comma-separated list of strings.

   * - Date
     - Date and time.
