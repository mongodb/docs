This page details features of MongoDB that may be important to keep in
mind when developing applications.

Schema Considerations
---------------------

Dynamic Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data in MongoDB has a *dynamic schema*. :term:`Collections
<collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. This
facilitates iterative development and polymorphism. Nevertheless,
collections often hold documents with highly homogeneous
structures. See :doc:`/core/data-models` for more information.

Some operational considerations include:

- the exact set of collections to be used;

- the indexes to be used: with the exception of the ``_id`` index, all
  indexes must be created explicitly;

- shard key declarations: choosing a good shard key is very important
  as the shard key cannot be changed once set.

Avoid importing unmodified data
directly from a relational database. In general, you will want to "roll
up" certain data into richer documents that take advantage of MongoDB's
support for embedded documents and nested arrays.

Case Sensitive Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB strings are case sensitive. So a search for ``"joe"`` will not
find ``"Joe"``.

Consider:

- storing data in a normalized case format, or

- using regular expressions ending with the ``i`` option, and/or

- using :doc:`$toLower </reference/operator/aggregation/toLower/>` or
  :doc:`$toUpper </reference/operator/aggregation/toUpper/>` in the
  :doc:`aggregation framework </core/aggregation-pipeline/>`.

Type Sensitive Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB data is stored in the BSON format, a binary encoded
serialization of JSON-like documents.  BSON encodes additional type
information. See `bsonspec.org <http://bsonspec.org/#/specification>`_
for more information.

Consider the following document which has a field ``x`` with the
*string* value ``"123"``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { x : "123" }

Then the following query which looks for a *number* value ``123`` will
**not** return that document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.mycollection.find( { x : 123 } )

General Considerations
----------------------

By Default, Updates Affect **one** Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update multiple documents that meet your query criteria, set the
:method:`update` ``multi`` option to ``true`` or ``1``.
See: :ref:`Update Multiple Documents <update-multiple-documents>`.

Prior to MongoDB 2.2, you would specify the ``upsert`` and ``multi``
options in the :method:`update` method as positional boolean
options. See: the :method:`update` method reference documentation.

BSON Document Size Limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit is currently set at 16 MB per
document. If you require larger documents, use :doc:`GridFS
</core/gridfs/>`.

No Fully Generalized Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB does not have :doc:`fully generalized transactions
</core/write-operations-atomicity>`. If you model your data
using rich documents that closely resemble your application's
objects, each logical object will be in one MongoDB document. MongoDB
allows you to modify a document in a single atomic operation. These
kinds of data modification pattern covers most common uses of
transactions in other systems.

Replica Set Considerations
--------------------------

Use an Odd Number of Replica Set Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Replica sets </replication/>` perform consensus elections. To
ensure that elections will proceed successfully, either use an odd
number of members, typically three, or else use an :term:`arbiter` to ensure an
odd number of votes.

Keep Replica Set Members Up-to-Date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB replica sets support :doc:`automatic failover
</core/replica-set-high-availability>`. It is important for
your secondaries to be up-to-date. There are various strategies for
assessing consistency:

1. Use monitoring tools to alert you to lag events. See
   :doc:`/administration/monitoring` for a detailed discussion of
   MongoDB's monitoring options.

#. Specify appropriate write concern.

#. If your application requires *manual* fail over,
   you can configure your secondaries
   as :ref:`priority 0 <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`.
   Priority 0 secondaries require manual action for a failover.
   This may be practical for a small replica set, but large deployments
   should fail over automatically.

.. seealso:: :ref:`replica set rollbacks <replica-set-rollback>`.

Sharding Considerations
-----------------------

- Pick your shard keys carefully. You cannot choose a new shard
  key for a collection that is already sharded.

- Shard key values are immutable.

- When enabling sharding on an *existing collection*, MongoDB imposes
  a maximum size on those collections to ensure that it is possible to
  create chunks. For a detailed explanation of this limit, see:
  :limit:`<sharding-existing-collection-data-size>`.

  To shard
  large amounts of data, create a new empty sharded collection, and
  ingest the data from the source collection using an application
  level import operation.

- Unique indexes are not enforced across shards except for the shard
  key itself. See :ref:`shard-key-arbitrary-uniqueness`.

- Consider :doc:`pre-splitting </tutorial/create-chunks-in-sharded-cluster>` an
  empty sharded collection before a massive bulk import.
