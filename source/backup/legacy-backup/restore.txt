|service| lets you restore data from a scheduled
:doc:`{+old-backup+} snapshot </backup/legacy-backup/overview>` or from
a selected point between snapshots.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/notes/backup-restore-roles.rst

- For replica sets, you can restore from selected points in time within
  the last 24 hours.
- For sharded clusters running:

  - |fcv| of 4.2 or earlier, you can restore from checkpoints between
    snapshots within the last 24 hours.
  - |fcv| of 4.2 or later, you can restore from selected points in time
    within the last 24 hours.

You can restore data to the same cluster from which the snapshot was
taken or to other clusters that |service| or |mms| manage.

For instructions on restoring data from a
:doc:`{+Cloud-Backup+} </backup/cloud-backup/overview>`,
see :ref:`restore-overview`.

Considerations
--------------

Downtime for the Target Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The restore process requires **downtime** for the target cluster.

MongoDB Versions Must Be Compatible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB versions must also be compatible. For instance, you cannot
restore from a snapshot of a 5.0 cluster to a 4.2 or earlier cluster.

Restore to |service| or |mms|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have the proper project permissions, you can restore to a
cluster of a different project in either |service| *or* |mms|:

.. list-table::

   * - Restore to Project on
     - Required Roles on Destination Project

   * - |service|
     - :authrole:`Project Owner`

   * - |mms|
     - One of the following |mms| roles:

       - :cloudmgr:`Organization Owner </reference/user-roles#Organization-Owner>`
       - :cloudmgr:`Project Owner </reference/user-roles#Project-Owner>`
       - :cloudmgr:`Project Backup Admin </reference/user-roles#Project-Backup-Admin>`

Prerequisites
-------------

Stop Client Operations during Restoration

Procedure
---------

In addition to standard snapshots and {+PIT-Restore+}, you can restore
a {+Old-Backup+} from a locally-downloaded snapshot file.
