Configuration File Options
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionchanged:: 2.6
   MongoDB introduces a YAML-based configuration file format.
   The :v2.4:`2.4 configuration file format
   </reference/configuration-options>` remains for backward
   compatibility.

Overview
--------

You can control :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances at
runtime using a configuration file. The configuration file contains
settings that are functionally equivalent to the :program:`mongod` and
:program:`mongos` command-line arguments but are easier to manage,
especially on large-scale deployments. Configuration files allow
commenting to describe the reasoning behind a server's settings.

If you installed from a package and have started MongoDB using
your system's :term:`control script`, you are already using a configuration
file.

Specifying the Configuration File when Starting MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` using a config file,
specify the config file with the :option:`--config` option.

For example, the following specifies a config file for a
:program:`mongod`:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf

The following specifies a config file for a :program:`mongos` using the
``-f`` alias:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongos -f /etc/mongodb.conf

Config File Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration file is in `YAML <http://www.yaml.org>`_ format.
The following is an example of several settings in a configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   systemLog:
      destination: file
      path: "/var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log"
      quiet: true
      logAppend: true
   storage:
      journal:
         enabled: true
   processManagement:
      fork: true
   net:
      bindIp: 127.0.0.1
      port: 27017
   ...
