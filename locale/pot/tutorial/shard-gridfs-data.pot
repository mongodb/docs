msgid "Most deployments will not need to shard the ``files`` collection. The ``files`` collection is typically small, and only contains metadata. None of the required keys for GridFS lend themselves to an even distribution in a sharded situation. If you *must* shard the ``files`` collection, use the ``_id`` field possibly in combination with an application field."

msgid "Leaving ``files`` unsharded means that all the file metadata documents live on one shard. For production GridFS stores you *must* store the ``files`` collection on a replica set."

If your write load is too high for a single server to handle, consider a different shard key or use a different value for ``_id`` in the ``files`` collection."
