  A. Upload your ``.pem`` file to the |mms| application host.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Admin` in the |mms| application to view the 
     ``Admin`` interface.

  #. Click the :guilabel:`General` tab, then click :guilabel:`Ops Manager Config`.

  #. Set :setting:`HTTPS PEM Key File` to the file system path where the ``.pem`` file
     is located on the |mms| host.

  #. Set :setting:`HTTPS PEM Key File Password` to the password for the ``.pem`` file.

  #. Set :setting:`URL to Access Ops Manager` to the new URL and port ``8443``
     for HTTPS access. The following is an example:

     .. code-block:: ini
       
        https://mms.example.net:8443

  #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

  #. (Optional) Configure the minimum TLS version.

     By default, TLS version 1.2 is the minimum required version for clients to
     connect to the |mms| application. To change the minimum TLS version,

     #. Click the :guilabel:`CUSTOM` tab.

     #. Enter :setting:`mms.minimumTLSVersion` in the :guilabel:`Key` field. 

     #. Enter the minimum TLS version in the :guilabel:`Value` field.

        The following values are valid: 

        * ``TLSv1``

        * ``TLSv1.1``

        * ``TLSv1.2``

     #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

  #. (Optional) Specify ciphers that |mms| clients may not use to connect
     to the |mms| application.

     #. Click the :guilabel:`CUSTOM` tab.

     #. Enter :setting:`mms.disableCiphers` in the :guilabel:`Key` field.

     #. Enter a comma-separated list of ciphers in the :guilabel:`Value`
        field.

     #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.
  

  #. Stop and restart the |mms| application.

     See :doc:`Start and Stop Ops Manager Application</tutorial/start-and-stop-application>`
     for instructions.

  A. Open ``automation-agent.config`` in a text editor on each host in your cluster.

     See :doc:`Automation Agent Configuration</reference/automation-agent>` for information
     on where to find this configuration file.

  #. Set the :setting:`mmsBaseUrl` property to match the value you
     entered in the :setting:`URL to Access Ops Manager` field in the
     |mms| ``Admin`` interface.

  #. If you are using a certificate that is not signed by a proper certificate
     authority, set the :setting:`sslRequireValidMMSServerCertificates`
     property to ``false``.

     Alternatively, upload your self-signed ``.ca`` file to each host in
     your cluster and set the :setting:`sslTrustedMMSServerCertificate` to
     the full path location of the file.

  #. Save your changes.

  #. Restart the Automation Agents for each host in your cluster.
