     If your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is using the :doc:`WiredTiger
     </core/wiredtiger>` storage engine, you must include the
     :option:`--storageEngine <mongod --storageEngine>` option (or :setting:`storage.engine` if
     using the configuration file) with the 3.0 binary.
 
  Shut down your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. Replace the existing
  binary with the downloaded :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary and restart.
