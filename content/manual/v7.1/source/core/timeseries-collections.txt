Time series data is a sequence of data points in which insights are
gained by analyzing changes over time.

Time series data is generally composed of these components:

- **Time** when the data point was recorded.

- **Metadata** (sometimes referred to as source), which is a label or tag
  that uniquely identifies a series and rarely changes.

- **Measurements** (sometimes referred to as metrics or values), which
  are the data points tracked at increments in time. Generally these are
  key-value pairs that change over time.

This table shows examples of time series data:

For efficient time series data storage, MongoDB provides time series
collections.

Time Series Collections
-----------------------

.. versionadded:: 5.0

Time series collections efficiently store time series data. In time
series collections, writes are organized so that data from the same
source is stored alongside other data points from a similar point in
time.

Benefits
~~~~~~~~

Compared to normal collections, storing time series data in time series
collections improves query efficiency and reduces the disk usage for
time series data and :term:`secondary indexes <secondary index>`.
MongoDB 6.3 and later automatically creates a :ref:`compound index
<index-type-compound>` on the time and metadata
fields for new time series collections. 

Time series collections use an underlying columnar storage format and
store data in time-order. This format provides the following benefits:

- Reduced complexity for working with time series data
- Improved query efficiency
- Reduced disk usage
- Reduced I/O for read operations
- Increased WiredTiger cache usage

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

Time series collections behave like typical collections. You insert
and query data as usual.

MongoDB treats time series collections as writable non-materialized
:ref:`views <views-landing-page>` backed by an internal collection. When
you insert data, the internal collection automatically organizes time
series data into an optimized storage format. 

Starting in MongoDB 6.3: if you create a new time series collection,
MongoDB also generates a :ref:`compound index <index-create-compound>`
on the :ref:`metaField and timeField <time-series-fields>` fields. To
improve query performance, queries on time series collections use the
new compound index. The compound index also uses the optimized storage
format.

.. tip::

   To improve query performance, you can manually :ref:`add secondary
   indexes <timeseries-add-secondary-index>` on measurement fields or
   any field in your time series collection.
