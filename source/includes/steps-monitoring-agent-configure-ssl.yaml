  If your MongoDB deployment uses SSL, then you must configure the
  Monitoring Agent to use SSL. To configure the agent to use SSL, you
  must have a trusted CA certificate that signed the MongoDB instance's
  certificate.
action:
  pre: |
    In the agent's install directory, edit the
    ``monitoring-agent.config`` file to set
    :bsetting:`sslTrustedServerCertificates` field to the path of a
    file containing one or more certificates in PEM format. For example:
  language: ini
  code: |
    sslTrustedServerCertificates=/path/to/mongodb-certs.pem
post: |
  By default, to connect to MongoDB instances using SSL requires a valid
  trusted certificate. For testing purposes, however, you can set the
  :msetting:`sslRequireValidServerCertificates` setting to ``False`` to
  bypass this check. This configuration is **not** recommended for
  production use as it makes the connection insecure.

  For additional information on these settings, see
  :ref:`monitoring-agent-ssl-settings`.
