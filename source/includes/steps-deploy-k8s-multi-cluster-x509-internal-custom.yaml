title: "Update your |mongodb-multi| to enable X509 authentication."
level: 4
content: |

  :ref:`Update your MongoDBMultiCluster custom resource <k8s-edit-database-resource>`
  with security settings from the |k8s-op-short|
  :ref:`MongoDBMultiCluster resource specification <multi-cluster-specification>`.
  Add the ``internalCluster`` setting, under ``spec.authentication``, and set it
  to ``"X509"``. The resulting configuration may look similar to the following example:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      apiVersion: mongodb.com/v1
      kind: MongoDBMultiCluster
      metadata:
       name: multi-replica-set
      spec:
       version: 5.0.0-ent
       type: ReplicaSet
       persistent: false
       duplicateServiceObjects: true
       credentials: my-credentials
       opsManager:
         configMapRef:
           name: my-project
       security:
         tls:
           ca: custom-ca
         certsSecretPrefix: <prefix>
       authentication:
         enabled: true
         modes: ["X509"]
         agents: 
           mode: "X509"
         internalCluster: "X509"
       clusterSpecList:
         - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_1_FULL_NAME}
           members: 3
         - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_2_FULL_NAME}
           members: 2
         - clusterName: ${MDB_CLUSTER_3_FULL_NAME}
           members: 3

   The |k8s-op-short| copies the ConfigMap with the |certauth| created in
   the central cluster to each member cluster, generates a concatenated
   |pem| secret, and distributes it to the member clusters.
