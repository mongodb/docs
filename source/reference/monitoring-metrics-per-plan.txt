Overview
--------

|mms| offers three plans, as described in the features list on `<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/>`_.
Each plan provides the monitoring metrics described here.

.. note:: Beginning with Monitoring Agent version 5.0.0, **Cloud Manager Premium**
          uses 10-second granularity for monitoring metrics.

The following table shows monitoring metrics for each |mms| plan.

     - Monitoring Data Storage Granularity
     - Database-Specific Statistics
     - Retention Rate for MongoDB Logs

   * - Premium
     - Data stored at 10-second granularity. You must run Monitoring Agent
       version 5.0.0 to store data at 10-second granularity. Earlier versions
       of the agent store data at 1-minute granularity.
     - All database-specific stats are retained.
     - MongoDB log data retained at a maximum rate of 2000 lines per minute.

   * - Standard
     - Data stored at 2 minute granularity.
     - All database-specific stats are retained.
     - MongoDB log data retained at a maximum rate of 2000 lines per 2 minutes.

   * - Free Tier
     - Data stored at 5 minute granularity and retained for 24 hours.
     - For hosts with greater than 1000 databases, only the following database-specific
       stats are retained: file size, data size, storage size, index size.
     - MongoDB log data retained at a maximum rate of 2000 lines per 3 minutes.

For **all plans**, chunk counts are stored for sharded clusters with fewer than
1000 sharded collections.

.. note:: In the event of higher than expected load, monitoring data for all
          plans may be throttled.
