Ensure Indexes Fit in RAM
=========================

   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

For the fastest processing, ensure that your indexes fit entirely in RAM so
that the system can avoid reading the index from disk.

To check the size of your indexes, use the
:method:`db.collection.totalIndexSize()` helper, which returns data in
bytes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   > db.collection.totalIndexSize()
   4294976499

The above example shows an index size of almost 4.3 gigabytes. To ensure
this index fits in RAM, you must not only have more than that much RAM
available but also must have RAM available for the rest of the
:term:`working set`. Also remember:

If you have and use multiple collections, you must consider the size
of all indexes on all collections. The indexes and the working set must be able to
fit in memory at the same time.

There are some limited cases where indexes do not need
to fit in memory. See :ref:`indexing-right-handed`.

Indexes that Hold Only Recent Values in RAM
-------------------------------------------

Indexes do not have to fit *entirely* into RAM in all cases. If the
value of the indexed field increments with every insert, and most queries
select recently added documents; then MongoDB only needs to keep the
parts of the index that hold the most recent or "right-most" values in
RAM. This allows for efficient index use for read and write
operations and minimize the amount of RAM required to support the
index.
