   .. step:: Install Dependencies
    
      Ensure you have `JDK version 8 or later
      <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html>`__ installed
      in your development environment.

      This guide shows you how to add the MongoDB Java driver dependencies using 
      Maven or Gradle in an integrated development environment (IDE). We
      recommend that you use an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse IDE. An IDE
      makes it more convenient to configure Maven or Gradle to build and run
      your project.

      If you are not using an IDE, see
      `Building Maven <https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-building-maven.html>`_
      or
      `Creating New Gradle Builds
      <https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/>`_
      for more information about how to set up your project. See `The MongoDB
      Reactive Streams Driver
      <https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mongodb/mongodb-driver-reactivestreams>`__
      to download the driver
      and dependencies directly from Maven.

   .. step:: Add the Driver and {+pr+} Bill of Materials
 
      .. _java-rs-get-started-install-bom:
  
      In your IDE, create a new `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ or
      `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__ project. This guide uses methods from the Reactor library, a library based on the
      Reactive Streams specification, so you must add its Bill of
      Materials (BOM) for dependency management. Add the BOM for MongoDB JVM artifacts and {+pr+} to your project to
      organize dependency versions. The BOM simplifies dependency
      management by ensuring that you maintain consistent and compatible
      versions of dependencies, such as between the {+driver-short+} and
      the core driver library. Use the BOM to avoid version conflicts
      and simplify upgrades.

      Select from the following :guilabel:`Maven` and :guilabel:`Gradle` tabs
      to view instructions for adding the BOM for each dependency manager:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Maven
            :tabid: maven bom
            
            Add the following code to the ``dependencyManagement`` list in your
            ``pom.xml`` file:

            .. code-block:: xml

               <dependencyManagement>
                   <dependencies>
                       <dependency>
                           <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
                           <artifactId>mongodb-driver-bom</artifactId>
                           <version>{+full-version+}</version>
                           <type>pom</type>
                           <scope>import</scope>
                       </dependency>
                       <dependency>
                           <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
                           <artifactId>reactor-bom</artifactId>
                           <version>2025.0.0</version>
                           <type>pom</type>
                           <scope>import</scope>
                       </dependency>
                   </dependencies>
               </dependencyManagement> 

         .. tab:: Gradle
            :tabid: gradle bom

            Add the following code to the dependencies list in your
            ``build.gradle.kts`` file. The code examples in this guide use the
            Kotlin DSL for Gradle:

            .. code-block:: kotlin

               dependencies {
                   implementation(platform("org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-bom:{+full-version+}"))
                   implementation(platform("io.projectreactor:reactor-bom:2025.0.0"))
               }

      To view a list of dependencies that the BOM manages, see
      the `mongodb-driver-bom dependency
      <https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mongodb/mongodb-driver-bom/{+full-version+}>`__
      and the `reactor-bom dependency
      <https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.projectreactor/reactor-bom>`__ listings
      on the Maven Repository website.

   .. step:: Install the {+pr+} Library
      
      If you are using `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__, add the 
      following to your ``pom.xml`` file:

      .. code-block:: xml

          <dependencies>
              ...
              <dependency>
                  <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
                  <artifactId>reactor-core</artifactId> 
              </dependency>
              <dependency>
                  <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
                  <artifactId>reactor-test</artifactId> 
                  <scope>test</scope>
              </dependency>
          </dependencies>
      
      To install Reactor by using `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__, add the following to your
      ``build.gradle.kts`` dependencies list:

      .. code-block:: kotlin

        dependencies {
            ...
            implementation("io.projectreactor:reactor-core")
          }

      Because you installed the BOM, you can omit a version in the
      {+pr+} dependency entry. The version you specify in the
      BOM determines the dependency versions to install.


      After you configure your dependencies, ensure they are available to your
      project by running your dependency manager and refreshing
      the project in your IDE.

   .. step:: Install the {+driver-short+}

      In your project, if you are using `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__, add the following to
      your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:

      .. code-block:: xml

        <dependencies>
            ...
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
                <artifactId>mongodb-driver-reactivestreams</artifactId>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>

      If you are using `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__, add the following to your
      ``build.gradle.kts`` dependencies list:

      .. code-block:: kotlin
        
          dependencies {
              ...
              implementation("org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-reactivestreams")
          }

      Because you installed the BOM, you can omit a version in the
      {+driver-short+} dependency entry. The version you specify in the
      BOM determines the dependency versions to install.

      After you configure your dependencies, ensure they are available to your
      project by running your dependency manager and refreshing
      the project in your IDE.
 
After you complete these steps, you have a new project 
and the driver dependencies installed.
