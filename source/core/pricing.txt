Backup Costs
------------

Backup costs are affected by the size of your backed-up snapshots and on your
settings for :ref:`snapshot frequency and retention <snapshot-frequency-and-retention>`.

Snapshot Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The per-gigabyte charge for Backup is applied to the size of your most
recent snapshot. A snapshot is roughly equivalent to the size of all
documents and all indexes for all the databases backed up.

To retrieve the size of the documents and indexes in a given database,
issue the :manual:`dbStats </reference/command/dbStats>` command and sum
the ``dataSize`` and ``indexSize`` fields. In the following example output
of a :manual:`dbStats </reference/command/dbStats>` command that was
issued to return gigabytes, the size of the database's documents and
indexes is roughly 79.07GB, as found by adding the ``dataSize`` and
``indexSize`` fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "db" : "mmsdbconfig",
       "collections" : 88,
       "objects" : 115153078,
       "avgObjSize" : 551.9170146368124,
       "dataSize" : 59.1901531778276,
       "storageSize" : 64.05994385480881,
       "numExtents" : 553,
       "indexes" : 235,
       "indexSize" : 19.876188188791275,
       "fileSize" : 89.89453125,
       "nsSizeMB" : 16,
       "extentFreeList" : {
           "num" : 19,
           "totalSize" : 0
       },
       "dataFileVersion" : {
           "major" : 4,
           "minor" : 22
       },
       "ok" : 1
   }

Frequency and Retention Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cost per gigabyte on the |mms| :guilabel:`Understanding Your Bill <pricing-information>`
page assumes an installation that uses the default settings for :ref:`snapshot
frequency and retention <snapshot-frequency-and-retention>`. Lowering snapshot
frequency or retaining fewer snapshots lowers the rate. Retaining an increased
number of snapshots increases the rate.

To view your rate, click the
:guilabel:`Usage Details` link on the :guilabel:`Billing/Subscriptions`
page.

To change a backed-up deployment's schedule, click :guilabel:`Backup`, then
the ellipsis icon for the backup, then :guilabel:`Edit Snapshot Schedule`.
Administrators can change frequency and retention through the
:doc:`snapshotSchedule resource </reference/api/snapshot-schedule>` in the
API. Lowering snapshot frequency increases how long it takes to build a
point-in-time restore.
