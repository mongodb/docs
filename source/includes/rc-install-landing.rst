.. topic:: Installing Release Candidates

   The installation tutorials in this section refer to the upcoming
   MongoDB 4.2 GA version and :red:`not` the release candidate
   available for testing; i.e. the procedures in this section
   :red:`will not` work for release candidates.

   .. include:: /includes/in-dev.rst

   Instead, you can test the new upcoming 4.2 features in Atlas without
   the hassle of installing locally. **Use Promocode**:
   ``MONGODB4DOT2`` for 200 USD credit.
   
   Alternatively, to install the :red:`release candidate` for testing,
   go instead to the `MongoDB Download Center`_ and manually download.
