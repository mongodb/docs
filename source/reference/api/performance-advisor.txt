Performance Advisor

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Use the following resources to retrieve existing and suggested indexes
for a deployment, as well as the namespaces on which slow queries were
run and the queries that were slow. For more information about slow
queries and possible performance improvements, see the
:doc:`Performance Advisor monitoring page </performance-advisor>`.

To view field values in a sample query in the Performance
Advisor, you must be a user with at least one of the following
project roles:

- :authrole:`Project Owner`

- :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin`

- :authrole:`Project Data Access Read/Write`

- :authrole:`Project Data Access Read Only`

Users without one of these roles see redacted data rather than the
field values.
