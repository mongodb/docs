Definition

.. method:: cursor.batchSize(size)

   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method.rst

   Specifies the maximum number of documents within each batch returned in a query result. By default, the initial batch size is ``101`` documents and subsequent batches have a maximum size of 16 mebibytes (MiB). This option can enforce a smaller
   limit than 16 MiB, but not a larger one. If you set ``batchSize`` to a limit that results in batches larger than 16 MiB, this option has no effect and :method:`~cursor.batchSize()` uses the default batch size.

   A ``batchSize`` of ``0`` means that the cursor is established, but no documents 
   are returned in the first batch. 

   .. note::

      If the batch size is too large, the cursor allocates more
      resources than it requires, which can negatively impact
      query performance.  If the batch size is too small, the
      cursor requires more network round trips to retrieve the
      query results, which can negatively impact query
      performance.

      Adjust ``batchSize`` to a value appropriate to your
      database, load, and application needs.

   The :method:`~cursor.batchSize()` method takes the
   following field:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
        - Type
        - Description
   
      * - ``size``
        - integer
        - The maximum number of documents to return for a batch. The
          default initial batch size is ``101`` documents and subsequent
          batches have a maximum size of 16 mebibytes (MiB). This option can enforce a smaller limit than
          16 MiB, but not a larger one. The default applies to drivers and
          Mongo Shell. For details, see :ref:`cursor-batches`.

Compatibility
-------------

This method is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

Example
-------

The following example sets ``batchSize`` for the results of a query
(specifically, :method:`~db.collection.find()`) to ``10``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find().batchSize(10)
