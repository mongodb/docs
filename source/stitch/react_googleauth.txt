   time: 15
   prerequisites:
     Before you start this Guide, see the instructions on how to enable `Google Authentication <https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/authentication/google/>`_ in your Stitch app. You will need an account on Google Cloud Services, an OAuth token generated by Google, and to enable and configure your Stitch application to use Google Authentication.

     The `Google Authentication Page <https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/authentication/google/>`_ will take you through these steps.

   check_your_environment:
     To deploy this sample application you will need `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/>`_ and access to github.com in order to download the sample application.
     If you would like to clone the github repository, you will need access to the ``git`` CLI (command line interface).

     To deploy your application, you will need a server to deploy your code. While Stitch allows for development in serverless environments, Google authentication will not work unless you deploy to a server.
   procedure:
     .. include:: /includes/steps/react_googleauth.rst
   summary:
     If you have successfully completed this guide, you have deployed a Stitch and React application with Google authentication enabled.
