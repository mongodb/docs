   :description: Learn to connect a Go application to a MongoDB Atlas cluster using the MongoDB Go Driver, including setting up a project, creating a cluster, and running queries.

.. include:: /includes/quick-start/overview.rst

Set Up Your Project
-------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create and initialize your project

      Create a new directory and initialize your project by using ``go mod``, as
      shown in the following commands:

      .. code-block:: shell

         mkdir go-quickstart
         cd go-quickstart
         go mod init go-quickstart

   .. step:: Add the {+driver-long+} as a dependency

      Use ``go get`` to add the {+driver-short+} as a dependency, as shown in
      the following command:

      .. code-block:: shell

         go get go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/v2/mongo

Create a MongoDB Cluster
------------------------

.. include:: /includes/quick-start/atlas-setup.rst

Query Your MongoDB Cluster from Your Application
------------------------------------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Add your connection string

      In your terminal, run the following command to create an environment
      variable called ``MONGODB_URI`` and set your Atlas connection string as
      its value: 

      .. code-block:: bash

         export MONGODB_URI='<your atlas connection string>'

      .. note::

         Make sure to replace the ``<db_password>`` section of the connection
         string with the password you created for your user that has
         **atlasAdmin** permissions.

   .. step:: Create a new file

      Run the following command from the base directory of your project to
      create a new file called ``main.go``:

      .. code-block:: shell

         touch main.go

   .. step:: Create your Go application

      Copy and paste the following code into your ``main.go`` file. This code
      runs a query on your sample dataset in MongoDB Atlas.

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/main.go
         :language: go
         :dedent:

   .. step:: Run your application

      Run the sample code with the following command from your command line:

      .. code-block:: bash

         go run main.go

      .. include:: /includes/quick-start/query-output.rst

      .. tip::

         If you receive no output or an error, check whether you properly set up
         your environment variable and ensure you have loaded the 
         :atlas:`sample datasets </sample-data/>` into your cluster.

After you complete these steps, you have a working application that uses
the {+driver-long+} to connect to your MongoDB cluster, runs a query on the
sample data, and prints out the result.
