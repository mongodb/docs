msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/sharded-cluster-shards.txt:37
msgid "Each database in a sharded cluster has a :term:`primary shard` that holds all the un-sharded collections for that database. Each database has its own primary shard. The primary shard has no relation to the :term:`primary` in a replica set."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/sharded-cluster-shards.txt:42
msgid "The :binary:`~bin.mongos` selects the primary shard when creating a new database by picking the shard in the cluster that has the least amount of data. :binary:`~bin.mongos` uses the ``totalSize`` field returned by the :dbcommand:`listDatabase` command as a part of the selection criteria."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/sharded-cluster-shards.txt:49
msgid "To change the primary shard for a database, use the :dbcommand:`movePrimary` command. The process of migrating the primary shard may take significant time to complete, and you should not access the collections associated to the database until it completes. Depending on the amount of data being migrated, the migration may affect overall cluster operations. Consider the impact to cluster operations and network load before attempting to change the primary shard."

msgid "When you deploy a new :term:`sharded cluster` with shards that were previously used as replica sets, all existing databases continue to reside on their original replica sets. Databases created subsequently may reside on any shard in the cluster."

Start each :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the replica set with the :option:`--auth <mongod --auth>` option to enforce RBAC. Alternatively, enforcing :doc:`/core/security-internal-authentication` for intra-cluster security also enables user access controls via RBAC."
