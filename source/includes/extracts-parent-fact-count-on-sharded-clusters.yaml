ref: _fact-count-sharded-clusters

  On a sharded cluster, {{countOp}} can result in an *inaccurate* count if
  :term:`orphaned documents <orphaned document>` exist or if a
  :doc:`chunk migration </core/sharding-balancer-administration>` is in progress.

  To avoid these situations, on a sharded cluster, use the
  :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method:

  You can use the :pipeline:`$count` stage to count the documents. For
  example, the following operation counts the documents in a collection:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.collection.aggregate( [
        { $count: "myCount" }
     ])

  The :pipeline:`$count` stage is equivalent to the following
  :pipeline:`$group` + :pipeline:`$project` sequence:
     
  .. code-block:: javascript
  
     db.collection.aggregate( [
        { $group: { _id: null, count: { $sum: 1 } } }
        { $project: { _id: 0 } }
     ] )

  .. seealso::

   :pipeline:`$collStats` to return an approximate count based on the collection's metadata.
