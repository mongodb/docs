Manage Developer Access
=======================

To create, update, or delete an App, you must have access to the MongoDB
Atlas project that contains the App. App Services determines developer
access permissions for a given MongoDB Cloud user based on their
assigned :atlas:`project roles </access/manage-project-access>`.

The following table describes the access permissions associated with a
given project role:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Project Role
     - Access Permissions

   * - Project Owner
     - Full read-write access for all Apps associated with the project.

   * - All Other Roles
     - Read-only access for all Apps associated with the project.

.. note::

   For more information about adding users and teams to Atlas, see
   :mms-docs:`Atlas Users and Teams </tutorial/manage-users/>`.

Allow Non-Owner Access
----------------------

You cannot directly modify an App without the Project Owner role in your
Atlas project. However, this role includes broad permissions that may be
too permissive for your organization.

To allow non-owners to modify an App, you can proxy the changes through
a source control system or CI/CD pipeline with more fine-grained
permissions. For example, you could enable :ref:`Automatic GitHub
Deployment <deploy-github>` and have developers push changes to the
repository instead of directly to the App.
