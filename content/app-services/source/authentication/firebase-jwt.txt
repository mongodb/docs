Firebase JWT Authentication (Custom JWT)
========================================

.. contents:: On this page
   :depth: 1

You can configure the :ref:`Custom JWT authentication provider
<custom-jwt-authentication>` to authenticate users that you manage with
:fcm:`Firebase Authentication <auth>`.

Before You Begin
----------------

You will need the following to use Firebase Authentication:

- A Firebase project with Authentication configured. To learn more,
  refer to the :fcm:`Firebase Authentication <auth>` documentation.

- An App Services App that does not already use Custom JWT
  authentication. To learn how to create a new App Services App, see
  :ref:`Create an App <create-app>`.

- If you're using the command line interface, you need {+cli-ref+} to be
  installed and authenticated on your local system.

- If you're using the Admin API, you need a MongoDB Atlas Admin API
  :atlas:`public/private key pair
  </configure-api-access/#std-label-atlas-prog-api-key>`. The API key
  must have :ref:`Project Owner <project-roles>` permissions.

Configure the Custom JWT authentication provider
------------------------------------------------

You can configure Custom JWT authentication from the UI or by modifying
the underlying configuration files directly with the CLI or Admin API.
Choose your preferred method below.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      In the left navigation menu, click :guilabel:`Authentication`.
      Then click the :guilabel:`Authentication Providers` tab and select
      the :guilabel:`Custom JWT` provider.

      Now you can configure the Custom JWT authentication provider to
      work with your Firebase project.

      1. Click the toggle to enable the provider.

      #. Set :guilabel:`Verification Method` to :guilabel:`Use a JWK
         URI`. Specify the following URL for :guilabel:`JWK URI`:

         .. code-block::

            https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com

      #. Define :guilabel:`Metadata Fields` to map data from the
         Firebase JWT to the corresponding App Services user account.

         None of the metadata fields are required. However, you might
         find them useful for getting user information from the Firebase
         JWT into your App.

         The following is a mapping from the Firebase JWT to an App
         Services user. You can add these to the table in the UI as they
         are or modify the mapping as you wish following the
         :ref:`Metadata Fields documentation
         <custom-jwt-authentication-configuration-metadata-fields>`.

         .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1
            :widths: 50 50

            * - Path

              - Field Name

            * - firebase.identities.email

              - emails

            * - firebase.sign_in_provider

              - signInProvider

            * - user_id

              - userId

            * - email_verified

              - emailVerified

            * - email

              - email

      #. Set :guilabel:`Audience` to your `Firebase Project ID
         <https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more#project-id>`__.

         .. important:: You must set Audience to Firebase Project ID

            You *must* set :guilabel:`Audience` to use your Firebase
            Project ID as a Custom JWT provider even though it's labeled
            as optional in the UI.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save` and deploy your changes

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      Run the following command, replacing the value of ``--remote``
      with your App's Client App ID. This downloads a local copy of your
      App's latest configuration files and navigates to the
      configuration file directory, which uses the same name as your
      App.

      .. code-block:: bash

         {+cli-bin+} pull --remote "myapp-abcde"
         cd myapp

      Add a new Custom JWT authentication provider to your App's
      ``/auth/providers.json`` file. Use the following configuration as
      a template, replacing the ``audience`` value with your Firebase
      Project ID. You can use the provided ``metadata_fields`` as they
      are or modify the mapping as you wish following the :ref:`Metadata
      Fields documentation
      <custom-jwt-authentication-configuration-metadata-fields>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /authentication/custom-jwt-firebase-config-template.json
         :language: json
         :caption: /auth/providers.json
         :emphasize-lines: 7

      Save your changes to ``/auth/providers.json``. Then, push the
      updated configuration file to deploy your App:

      .. code-block:: bash

         {+cli-bin+} push

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      Add a new Custom JWT authentication provider to your App using the
      :admin-api-endpoint:`Create an authentication provider
      <tag/adminCreateAuthProvider>` endpoint.

      Use the following configuration as a template. Make sure to:

      - Specify your App's ``$PROJECT_ID`` and ``$APP_ID``
      - Include an Admin API access token in the ``Authorization``
        header.
      - Replace the ``audience`` value in the request body with your
        Firebase Project ID.

      You can use the provided ``metadata_fields`` as they are or
      modify the mapping as you wish following the :ref:`Metadata
      Fields documentation
      <custom-jwt-authentication-configuration-metadata-fields>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /authentication/custom-jwt-firebase-config-admin-api-template.sh
         :language: bash
         :emphasize-lines: 10

Log in with a Firebase JWT
--------------------------

Once you've configured the Custom JWT authentication provider to use
Firebase Authentication, you can log in to your App Services App with a
Firebase JWT.

#. Log the user into Firebase. To learn how, see the relevant
   :fcm:`Firebase SDK documentation <auth>` for your platform and
   programming language.

#. Get the user's Firebase JWT. To learn how, see :fcm:`Retrieve ID
   tokens on clients
   <auth/admin/verify-id-tokens#retrieve_id_tokens_on_clients>` in the
   Firebase documentation.

#. Use the Firebase JWT to authenticate with Atlas App Services. You can
   :ref:`start a session over HTTP <manage-user-sessions>` or log in
   with an SDK. To learn how, see the docs for your SDK:

   .. include:: /includes/custom-jwt-authentication-sdk-examples.rst
