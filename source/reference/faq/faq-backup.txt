The introduction of the MongoDB Agent and the new backup process for
MongoDB 4.2 with a |fcv-link| of ``4.2`` have changed some of these
answers. Those answers have admonitions explaining the impact of these
new features to existing answers.

Requirements
------------

.. cond:: onprem

   What Version of MongoDB Does the Backup Feature Require?
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. include:: /includes/list-table-mongodb-version-compatibility.rst

What MongoDB Permissions does Backup Require?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are backing up a MongoDB instance that has authentication
enabled, the {+mdbagent+} requires the privileges described for the
MongoDB Agent backup function.

.. seealso:: :manual:`User Privilege Roles in MongoDB </reference/user-privileges/>`.

How Does |mms| Measure Data Size?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| uses the following conversions to measure snapshot size and to
measure how much oplog data has been processed:

- 1 MB = 1024\ :sup:`2` bytes (1 MiB)

- 1 GB = 1024\ :sup:`3` bytes (1 GiB)

- 1 TB = 1024\ :sup:`4` bytes (1 TiB)

Does Backup Work with All Types of Deployments?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No.

- For any MongoDB with |fcv| of ``4.0`` and earlier databases, Backup
  does not currently support standalone deployments. Backup has full
  support for replica sets and sharded clusters.

- For MongoDB 4.2 with |fcv| of ``4.2`` and later databases, see
  :ref:`Backup Considerations for Databases running FCV: 4.2 <4.2-backup-considerations>`

Why Does The Backup Feature Not Support Standalone Deployments?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   This answer applies only to databases running MongoDB 4.2 with |fcv|
   of ``4.0`` and earlier

After an initial sync of your data, |mms| copies data from the
:term:`oplog` to provide a continuous backup with point-in-time
recovery. |mms| does not support backup of standalone hosts because
they do not have an :term:`oplog`. To support backup with a single
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, you can run a one-member replica set.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set`

Operations
----------

.. cond:: onprem

   How Does The Backup Feature Work?
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To learn about the Backup feature, see :doc:`/core/backup-overview`.

Will Backup Impact My Production Databases?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   This answer applies only to databases running MongoDB with |fcv|
   of ``4.0`` and earlier

The Backup feature typically has minimal impact on production MongoDB
deployments. This impact performs similar to that of adding a new
:term:`secondary` to a :term:`replica set`.

By default, the Backup Agent performs its initial sync, the most
resource intensive operation for backups, against a secondary member of
the replica set to limit its impact. You may optionally configure the
Backup Agent to perform the initial sync against the replica set's
:term:`primary`, although this will increase the impact of the initial
sync operation.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/faq-backup-size-limit.rst

How Do I Maintain a Replica Set with Backup enabled?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most operations in a replica set are replicated via the oplog and are
thus captured by the backup process. Some operations, however, make
changes that are *not* replicated: for these operations you *must*
have |mms|
:doc:`resync from your current replica set </tutorial/resync-backup>`
to include the changes.

The following operations are not replicated and therefore require
resync:

- Renaming or deleting a database by deleting the data files in the
  data directory. As an alternative, remove databases using an
  operation that MongoDB will replicate, such as
  :method:`db.dropDatabase` from the |mongo| shell.

- Changing any data while the instance is running as a
  :term:`standalone`.

- Rolling index builds.

- Using :dbcommand:`compact` or :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` to reclaim
  a significant amount of space.

  .. cond:: cloud

     Resync is not strictly necessary after :dbcommand:`compact` or
     :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` operations but will ensure that the
     |mms| copy of the data is resized, which means quicker restores
     and lower cost.

  .. cond:: onprem

     Resync is not strictly necessary after :dbcommand:`compact` or
     :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` operations but will ensure that the
     |mms| copy of the data is resized, which means quicker restores.

Legacy Backup Agent
-------------------

Backup capability has been moved to the {+mdbagent+} with Backup
activated. This replaces the individual Backup Agent. This information
covers issues unique to the legacy Backup Agent. All of this
information applies to MongoDB databases running |fcv| of ``4.0`` or
earlier.

Where Should I Run The Backup Agent?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the Backup Agent on a host that:

- Is separate from your MongoDB instances. This avoids system resource
  contention.

- Can connect to your MongoDB instances. Check network settings for
  connections between the agent and MongoDB hosts. For a list of
  needed ports, see
  :doc:`open ports for agents </reference/firewall-configuration>`.

- Has at least 2 CPU cores and 3 GB of RAM above platform
  requirements. With each backup job it runs, the Backup Agent further
  impacts host performance.

Can I Run the Backup and Monitoring Agents on a Single System?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no technical restriction that prevents the Backup Agent and
the {+magent+} from running on a single system or host. However,
both agents have resource requirements, and running both on a single
system can affect the ability of these agents to support your
deployment in |mms|.

The resources required by the Backup Agent depend on rate and size
of new oplog entries (i.e. total oplog gigabyte/hour produced.)
The resources that the {+magent+} requires depends on the number
of monitored :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances and the total number of
:term:`databases <database>` provided by the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances.

Can I Run Multiple Backup Agents to Achieve High Availability?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run multiple Backup Agents for high availability. If you do,
the Backup Agents must run on different hosts.

When you run multiple Backup Agents, only one agent per project is the
**primary agent**. The primary agent performs the backups. The
remaining agents are completely idle, except to log their status as
standbys and to periodically ask |mms| whether they should become the
primary.

Does the Backup Agent Modify My Database?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Backup Agent writes a small token called a :term:`checkpoint` into
the oplog of the source database at a regular interval. These tokens
provide a heartbeat for backups and have no effect on the source
deployment. Each token is less than 100 bytes.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/important/checkpoints-fcv-4-0-only.rst

.. seealso:: :ref:`checkpoint`

How Does the Initial Backup Sync Impact Database Performance?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The impact of the initial backup synchronization should be similar to
syncing a new secondary replica set member. The Backup Agent does not
throttle its activity, and attempts to perform the sync as quickly as
possible.

Namespace Filters
-----------------

.. important::

   This feature is incompatible with MongoDB 4.2 with |fcv| of ``4.2``.

How Can I Prevent |mms| from Backing Up a Collection?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| provides a :ref:`namespaces filter <namespaces-filter>` that
allows you to specify which collections or databases to back up.

How Can I Change which Namespaces Are Backed Up?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To edit the filter, see :doc:`/tutorial/edit-backup`. Changing the
:ref:`namespaces filter <namespaces-filter>` might necessitate a
resync. If so, |mms| handles the resync.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/faq-backup-jobs-fail-to-bind.rst

.. "How do I resolve applyOps errors during backups":

.. include:: /includes/extracts/faq-applyops-errors.rst

Data Restoration
----------------

|mms| produces a copy of your data files that you can use to seed a
new deployment.

How Does |mms| Provide Point-in-Time Restores?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. cond:: onprem

   .. important::

      |onprem| 4.2.13 and later supports this feature with |fcv| of
      ``4.2`` or later.

|mms| first creates a local restore of a snapshot preceding the point
in time and downloads it to your target host. The MongoDB Backup
Restore Utility running on that host then downloads and applies oplog
entries to reach the specified point in time.

.. cond:: onprem

   The ability of |mms| to provide a given point-in-time restore
   depends on the retention policy of the snapshots and the configured
   point-in-time window.

   To learn more about retention policy and the point-in-time window,
   see :ref:`edit-snapshot-schedule`.

.. cond:: cloud

   |mms| can build a restore to any point in time within a 24-hour
   period by replaying the oplog to the desired time.

   To learn how to restore replica sets and sharded clusters, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/nav/backup-restore-deployments`

Can I Take Snapshots More Frequently than Every 6 Hours?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. |mms| does not support a snapshot schedule more frequent than
every 6 hours. For more information, see
:ref:`snapshot-frequency-and-retention`.

Can I Set My Own Snapshot Retention Policy?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. You can change the schedule through the :guilabel:`Edit Snapshot
Schedule` menu option for a backed-up deployment.
Administrators can change the :ref:`snapshot frequency and retention
policy <snapshot-frequency-and-retention>` through the
:doc:`snapshotSchedule resource </reference/api/snapshot-schedule>` in
the API.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/faq-backup-costs.rst

.. "How many copies of my data does Cloud Manager store":

.. include:: /includes/extracts/faq-copies-of-data.rst

How Long Does It Take to Create a Restore Snapshot?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| transmits all backups in a compressed form from the |mms| host
to your infrastructure.

.. cond:: cloud

   Within the U.S., |mms| sends snapshots at 50 to 100 Mbps. Assuming a
   compression factor of 4x and transmission speeds of 50 Mbps,
   transmitting a 250 GB snapshot takes 2.5 hours.

In addition, point-in-time restores depend upon the amount the oplog
entries that your host must apply to the received snapshot to roll
forward to the requested point-in-time of the backup.

Does the Backup Feature Perform Any Data Validation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Backup conducts basic corruption checks and provides an alert if any
component (e.g. the agent) is down or broken, but does not perform
explicit data validation. When it detects corruption, |mms| errs on
the side of caution and invalidates the current backup and sends an
alert.

How Do I Restore a Snapshot?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can request a restore via |mms|, where you can then choose which
snapshot to restore and how you want |mms| to deliver the restore. All
restores require 2-factor authentication. If you have SMS set up, |mms|
will send an authorization code via SMS. You must enter the
authorization code into the backup interface to begin the restore
process.

.. include:: /includes/fact-two-factor-auth-India-limit.rst

What Is Delivered when I Restore a Snapshot?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| delivers restores as ``tar.gz`` archives of MongoDB data files.

To learn more about restores, see
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/backup-restore-deployments`.

How Does |mms| Roll Back Backed-up Data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your MongoDB deployment experiences a
:manual:`rollback </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`, then |mms| also
rolls back the backed-up data.

|mms| detects the rollback when a
:term:`tailing cursor <tailable cursor>` finds a mismatch in
timestamps or hashes of write operations. |mms| enters a rollback
state and tests three points in the oplog of your replica set's
:term:`primary` to locate a common point in history. |mms| rollback
differs from MongoDB :term:`secondary` rollback in that the common
point does not necessarily have to be the most *recent* common point.

When |mms| finds a common point, the service invalidates oplog entries
and snapshots beyond that point and rolls back to the most recent
snapshot before the common point. |mms| then resumes normal backup
operations.

If |mms| cannot find a common point, a
:doc:`resync </tutorial/resync-backup>` is required.

What Conditions Require a Resync?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   This feature is incompatible with MongoDB 4.2 with |fcv| of ``4.2``.

If the Backup Agent's :term:`tailing cursor <tailable cursor>` cannot
keep up with your deployment's :term:`oplog`, then you must
:doc:`resync your backups </tutorial/resync-backup>`.

This scenario might occur if:

- Your application periodically generates a lot of data, shrinking the
  primary's oplog window to the point that data is written to the
  oplog faster than |mms| can consume it.

- If the Backup Agent is running on an under-provisioned or over-used
  machine and cannot keep up with the oplog activity.

- If the Backup Agent is down for a period of time longer than the
  oplog size allows. If you bring down your agents, such as for
  maintenance, restart them in a timely manner. For more information
  on oplog size, see
  :manual:`Replica Set Oplog </core/replica-set-oplog>` in the MongoDB
  manual.

- If you delete all replica set data and deploy a new replica set with
  the same name, as might happen in a test environment where
  deployments are regularly torn down and rebuilt.

- If there is a rollback, and |mms| cannot find a common point in the
  oplog.

- If an oplog event tries to update a document that does not exist in
  the backup of the replica set, as might happen if syncing from a
  secondary that has inconsistent data with respect to the primary.

- If you
  :ref:`create an index in a rolling fashion <data-explorer-indexes>`.
