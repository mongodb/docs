|mms| Server 1.5.3
------------------

*Released 2014-12-17*

Significant improvements in performance for the processing of MMS
Monitoring data for |mms| Groups with a large number of hosts

|mms| Server 1.5.2
------------------

*Released 2014-11-18*

- Added Support for archive restores (``.tar.gz``) for databases whose
  filenames exceed 100 characters.

- API: Skip missed points in metrics data, instead of returning empty
  data.

- API: Return correct number of data points when querying metric data
  with the period option.

- Backup Agent update to ``2.3.3.209-1``

|mms| Server 1.5.1
------------------

*Released 2014-09-26*

- Fix cases where replica set member alerts (e.g. no primary, number
  of healthy members) could send false positives.

- Skip ``backup-daemon`` :setting:`rootDirectory` and
  :setting:`mongo.backupdb.mongoUri` overlap check when the
  :setting:`mongo.backupdb.mongoUri` is on a different
  host.

- ``mms-gen-key`` script handles user's effective group being
  different than the username.

- Security enhancements.

|mms| Server 1.5.0
------------------

*Released 2014-09-02*

Considerations for Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- |mms| *only* supports direct upgrades from 1.3 and 1.4.

- Change in configurations and policy for 2FA:  Two-factor
  authentication must now be explicitly enabled using the
  :setting:`mms.multiFactorAuth.require` setting.

- The default LDAP group separator became ``;;``. Previously the
  separator was ``,``. See the :ref:`LDAP configuration
  <default-ldap-separator>` documentation for more information.

- Suppressed hosts will only remain suppressed for 30 minutes.

  Previously, if after deleting a host, from |mms| Monitoring the
  hostname and port combination would be added to a suppression list with an infinite
  lifetime. The suppression list prevented a race condition where host in a cluster would
  be auto-discovered by another member of a deployment before the host
  could was fully removed. Now, hostname and port combinations remain
  on the suppression list for only 30 minutes.

- Set the :setting:`mms.remoteIp.header` in the
  ``conf-mms.properties`` file  if clients access the |mms| Application
  via a load balancer.

- :setting:`mongo.backupdb.mongoUri` is no longer in
  ``conf-mms.properties``. This was previously a required field in this
  file. It remains in the backup daemons's ``conf-daemon.properties``.

- Stored MongoDB profile data is not transferred between OnPrem 1.4
  and OnPrem 1.5 during the upgrade process.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- When an |mms| Backup job fails to bind, the system will periodically
  and automatically retry.

- All |mms| Backup jobs will retry indefinitely.

- Point in Time restores are now available with one second granularity.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :doc:`|mms| Public API </reference/api>`.

- Explicit support for multiple |mms| Backup Blockstore Databases and
  the ability to pin |mms| Groups to specific backup daemons and
  databases. See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-data-locality` for
  more information.

- |mms| can authenticate using LDAP to both the database backing |mms| and
  the monitored and backed up MongoDB deployments. See :ref:`security-ldap`.

- Enhanced auditing. See :doc:`/reference/audit-events` for more
  information.

- Ability to acknowledge alerts with comments.

- New cluster page that shows individual, sum or average metrics for
  all shards in a cluster.


|mms| Server 1.4.3
------------------

*Released 2014-07-22*

- Addressed issues related to Backup Job assignment for 2.6.x clusters
  that used the :authrole:`clusterMonitor` role to support MMS
  Monitoring.

- Fixed problem importing email addresses for users for deployments
  that use LDAP integration.

- Fixed rare race condition caused high CPU usage in the |mms| HTTP
  Service if the application cannot connect to one of the backing databases.

- Additional security enhancements.

|mms| Server  ``1.4.2``
-----------------------

*Released 2014-05-29*

- Critical bug fix for backing up MongoDB 2.6 deployments that include
  user or custom role definitions:

  - The :data:`system.version` collection in the admin database will
    be included in all future snapshots.

  - The :data:`system.roles` collection in the admin database will be
    included after a new initial sync is performed.

  Users capturing backups of MongoDB 2.6 replica sets
  or clusters with |mms| that include custom role definitions should perform a
  new initial sync. Taking a new initial sync will ensure that the
  role definitions are included in the backup.

- Disable MongoDB :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` for insert-only MMS
  Backup collections.

- Speed optimization for |mms| Backup HTTP pull restores.

- Fix for LDAP integration, |mms| now passes full ``dn`` correctly when
  authenticating the user.

|mms| Server  ``1.4.1``
-----------------------

*Released 2014-04-28*

- Ability to Backup replica sets or clusters using Kerberos authentication

- Ability to Backup replica sets or clusters running specific custom
  MongoDB builds provided by MongoDB, Inc.

- Fix validation issue preventing Backup of MongoDB 2.6.0 clusters

- Reduced log noise from Monitoring Agent when monitoring MongoDB 2.0 or unreachable mongods

|mms| Server  ``1.4.0``
-----------------------

*Released 2014-04-08*

- Includes |mms| Backup: continuous backup with point-in-time recovery of replica
  sets and cluster-wide snapshots of sharded clusters.

- Finer-grained roles and permissions.

- Improved user interface for alerts.

- Enhanced Activity Feed for auditing of all activity.

- Monitoring Agent distributed as OS-specific binary. Python dependency removed.

- LDAP integration for managing users and groups.

|mms| OnPrem 1.4.0 requires MongoDB 2.4.9+ instances for :doc:`backing
storage </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>`.

|mms| Server  ``1.3.0``
-----------------------
