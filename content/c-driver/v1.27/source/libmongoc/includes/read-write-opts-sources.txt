Use this function for commands that both read and write, such as "mapReduce" with an output collection.

Read and write concern and collation can be overridden by various sources. In a transaction, read concern
and write concern are prohibited in ``opts``. The highest-priority sources for these options are listed
first in the following table. Read preferences are *not* applied. The write concern is omitted for MongoDB
before 3.4.
