The :guilabel:`Data Explorer` in |service| provides the ability to:

- View databases,collections and indexes in your cluster.

- Create and drop databases, collections, and indexes.

- Insert/edit/delete documents.

Data explorer reads from the primary unless the primary is unavailable.
If the primary is unavailable, data explorer reads from a non-hidden,
non-delayed secondary member.

.. _de-shard-collection-for-global-writes:

Shard a Collection for |global-write|
-------------------------------------

|service| users with the :authrole:`Project Owner` role can
shard collections in 
:ref:`Global Clusters <create-new-global-write-cluster>` using the
:guilabel:`Data Explorer`.

Collections must meet the following criteria before you can shard them
for Global Writes:

- Every document in the collection must include a ``location`` field.

- The value of the ``location`` field **must** be either an
  `ISO-3166-1 alpha 2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1>`_
  country code (``"US"``, ``"DE"``, ``"IN"``) *or* a supported
  `ISO-3166-2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2>`_ 
  subdivision code (``"US-DC"``, ``"DE-BE"``, ``"IN-DL"``). 
  Documents that do not match this criteria can be routed to any shard 
  in the cluster. To view the complete list of currently supported 
  country or subdivision codes, visit
  https://cloud.mongodb.com/static/atlas/country_iso_codes.txt.

The ``location`` field is the first of two document fields that form a
compound shard key. The administrator chooses the second field of the
key during the following procedure. See `Choosing a Shard Key
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/sharding-shard-key/#choosing-a-shard-key>`_
for guidance on choosing a secondary shard key and the effect of shard
key choice on data distribution. See :manual:`Sharding </sharding>` for
general information about sharding.

.. important::

   After selecting a shard key via the
   Data Explorer, |service| attempts to shard the target collection. 
   During this period, ensure that no user manually
   shards the collection. If |service| detects that the target 
   collection was sharded with a different key than that selected via 
   the Data Explorer, |service| stops the procedure and 
   displays a warning for that collection in the Data Explorer. You can 
   clear the warning by clicking :guilabel:`Unmanage Collection`, 
   which removes the collection from |service| management while leaving
   the underlying collection and the manually chosen shard key intact.

To shard a collection in a |global-write-cluster|

.. include:: /includes/steps/shard-collection-for-global-writes.rst

|service| displays the compound shard key near the top of the
:guilabel:`Global Writes` tab after configuring the collection.
