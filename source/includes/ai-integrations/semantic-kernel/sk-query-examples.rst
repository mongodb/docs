In your notebook, run the following code to perform a basic semantic 
search for the string ``What is my job title?``. It prints the most  
relevant document and a :ref:`relevance score <scoring-ref>` between 
``0`` and ``1``.

.. io-code-block:: 
   :copyable: true 

   .. input:: 
      :language: python

      result = await memory.search("test", "What is my job title?")
      print(f"Retrieved document: {result[0].text}, {result[0].relevance}")

   .. output::

      Retrieved document: I am a developer, 0.8991971015930176
