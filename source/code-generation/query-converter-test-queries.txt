Use the :guilabel:`Test Queries` pane to test SQL queries,
views, and stored procedures converted by :ref:`rm-query-converter`. 
This feature uses the project's source 
and destination database connections and allows you to
run the original SQL and converted MongoDB code.
The results from each query are displayed on the 
:guilabel:`Test Queries` pane, allowing for a side-by-side 
comparison.

Use Cases
---------

The :guilabel:`Test Queries` pane allows you to:

- Compare your original and converted 
  query results in a single place.
- Increase your confidence in code automatically 
  converted by the Query Converter.
- See potential logic errors and edit the converted 
  code before moving it to production.

Requirements
------------

To test converted queries in Relational Migrator, 
you must run the Query Runner Docker container. This 
container can be run locally or hosted remotely. 
For details, see :ref:`rm-install-query-runner`.

Get Started
-----------

- :ref:`rm-install-query-runner`
