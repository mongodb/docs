|service| offers the following security features for 
{+database-deployment+} authentication.

To learn about recommendations for authentication,
see :ref:`arch-center-authentication-recs` in the
{+atlas-arch-center+}.

.. important::

   {+service+} requires any user that needs access to the {+service+}
   control plane to have :abbr:`MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)`
   configured for enhanced security.

   If you use {+service+} :ref:`<atlas-org-users>`, configure and
   manage MFA within {+service+}. You must use MFA when using
   {+service+} credentials.

   If you use federated authentication, configure and manage MFA in
   the :abbr:`IdP (Identity Provider)`.

   If you don't configure MFA, {+service+} supports the following MFA
   methods as secondary identification:

   - Security keys
   - Biometrics
   - OTP (One-Time Password) authenticators 
   - Push notifications with Okta Verify
   - Email
   
   To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-enable-mfa`.

Database User Authentication
----------------------------

|service| requires clients to authenticate to access
{+database-deployments+}. You must create database users to access the
database. To set up database users for your {+database-deployments+}, 
see :ref:`mongodb-users`.

Custom Database Roles
---------------------

When the built-in |service|
:ref:`database user privileges <atlas-user-privileges>` don't
meet your desired set of privileges, you can create :ref:`custom roles 
<mongodb-roles>`.

Authentication with AWS IAM
---------------------------

You can authenticate applications running on |aws| services to |service|
{+clusters+} with |aws| |iam| roles. You can set up a database user to
use an |aws| |iam| role ARN for authentication and connect to your
database using {+mongosh+} and drivers that authenticate using your |aws|
|iam| role ARN. Using |aws| |iam| role reduces the number of
authentication mechanisms and number of secrets to manage.

To learn more, see :ref:`set-up-pwdless-auth`. 

User Authentication with |ldap|
-------------------------------

|service| supports performing user authentication with |ldap|. To use |ldap|, 
see :doc:`/security-ldaps`.

User Authentication with |oidc|
-------------------------------

|service| supports performing user authentication
with |oidc|. To use |oidc|, see :ref:`oidc-authentication-authorization`.

User Authentication with X.509
------------------------------

X.509 client certificates provide database users access to the 
{+database-deployments+} in your project. Options for X.509 
authentication include |service|-managed X.509 authentication and 
self-managed X.509 authentication. To learn more 
about self-managed X.509 authentication, see :ref:`self-managed-x509`.
