  To choose logs to download, perform the following actions:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 30 70
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Action

       - Purpose

     * - Click :guilabel:`MongoDB Logs`

       - Gather logs from deployed MongoDB processes.

         This option isn't available for deployed MongoDB processes 
         if the :manual:`systemLog.destination </reference/configuration-options/#mongodb-setting-systemLog.destination>` 
         property is set to ``syslog``.

     * - Click :guilabel:`FTDC Data`

       - Gather the diagnostic data files from the (:abbr:`FTDC
         (full-time diagnostic data capture)`) collection mechanism,
         such as server statistics and status messages.

     * - Click :guilabel:`Automation Agent Logs`

       - Gather logs from the deployed Automation Agents.

     * - Click :guilabel:`Backup Agent Logs`

       - Gather logs from all deployed Backup Agents.

         This differs from other logs. The logs collected are not
         limited to the selected hosts, but include all Backup Agent
         logs in the deployment.

     * - Click :guilabel:`Monitoring Agent Logs`

       - Gather logs from all deployed
         Monitoring Agent.

         This differs from other logs. The logs collected are not
         limited to the selected hosts, but include all Monitoring
         Agent logs in the deployment.

     * - Set :guilabel:`Size per Log Type` in MB

       - Enter the maximum cumulative uncompressed size in megabytes
         of all selected log files.

         - This limit is *cumulative*.

           - For MongoDB or |ftdc| logs, this limits the size of the
             collected logs per process.
           - For Agents, this limts the size of related logs per Agent.

         - Those log files are then archived and compressed.

           For example, if you set this value to ``50`` MB, |mms| gathers a total
           of 50 MB of uncompressed log file from every |mongod| and
           |mongos| process and each Agent for all logs you chose to
           download.

         - If the current log file is less than the specified size,
           |mms| gathers the most recent rotated file as well.

         - If the total size of the log files reaches the specified
           size part way through a log file, this last log file is
           truncated to the most recent line that falls within the
           specified size.

         - The maximum amount of log files that can be collected is 20
           GB. This maximum includes all collected log files that have
           not expired. If you request additional logs and collecting
           those logs results in more than 20 GB of logs collected,
           |mms| generates an error. The total amount of logs
           collected compared to the limit is displayed as
           :guilabel:`Estimated Total Size`.

  .. example::

     You choose to collect 20 MB of logs from all processes in a
     :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`. This replica set has three :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>`
     processes on two hosts:

     - ``host1:27017``
     - ``host2:27017``
     - ``host2:27018``

     Your deployment runs the following agents:

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 50 50

        * - Automation Agent
          - ``host1``, ``host2``, ``host4``, ``host5``

        * - Backup Agent
          - ``host4``

        * - Monitoring Agent
          - ``host4``, ``host5``

     When you choose all the log types for this replica set, and limit
     to 20 MB per process, |mms| shows that the :guilabel:`Estimated
     Total Size` is 220 MB (11 processes * 20 MB) out of 20 GB.

     Once the log collection begins, |mms| scans the log directories
     for the ``mongod`` processes and their associated |ftdc| from the
     most current log entry until 20 MB of log files or the end of the
     last log is collected. All the Monitoring and Backup Agents in the
     deployment are also scanned.

     - The Backup Agent has 60 MB of logs.
     - Each MongoDB process (3) has 7 MB of logs plus 15 MB of
       |ftdc| data per process.
     - Each Monitoring Agent (2) has 30 MB of logs.
     - Each Automation Agent (2) has 12 MB of logs.

     The total size of logs collected is **150 MB**:

     (20 + (3 * (7 + 15)) + (2 * 20) + (2 * 12)) = 150

     - The maximum of 20 MB of logs from the Backup Agent is collected.
     - All of the logs for each MongoDB process are collected:
       7 MB of MongoDB + 15 MB of |ftdc| data.
     - The maximum of 20 MB of logs from each Monitoring Agent is
       collected.
     - All of the Automation Agent logs from ``host1`` and ``host2``
       are collected. ``host4`` and ``host5`` do not host any processes
       in the :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`.

     The resulting archive structure within the downloaded archive is:

     .. code-block:: sh

        host1/27017/mongodb
        host1/27017/ftdc
        host1/automation_agent
        host2/27017/mongodb
        host2/27017/ftdc
        host2/27018/mongodb
        host2/27018/ftdc
        host2/automation_agent
        host4/backup_agent
        host4/monitoring_agent
        host5/monitoring_agent

  To anonymize your logs, select
  :guilabel:`Replace IP addresses, hostnames, namespaces, strings with 
  randomized values`. 
  
  This option replaces IP addresses with a private range (192.168.x.x). 
  For hostnames, this option replaces only |fqdn|. Other hostnames 
  remain unchanged. Replacements follow a predictable pattern. For 
  example, if ``blue.strawberry`` replaces one instance of the |fqdn| 
  ``test.internal``, ``blue.strawberry`` replaces all other instances 
  of ``test.internal`` as well.

  .. note::

     This does not use the
     :manual:`$redact </reference/operator/aggregation/redact>`
     aggregation pipeline. That is a separate capability with a
     broader feature set.

  Entry Status shows :guilabel:`Collecting Logs...` and automatically
  updates its status as log collection continues.

  - If |mms| fails to retrieve log files, click :guilabel:`Retry` to
    retrieve the failed log files again.

  - If a failure has occurred, you can still download the archive. Some
    of the requested log files will be missing.

  Click the :guilabel:`Download icon`.

  The size listed for the archive on the :guilabel:`Log Request
  History` page is the uncompressed size. The archive consumes
  that amount of disk space on the target host once it is extracted.

  This download can only be restarted and not resumed. If the download
  fails, you must download the logs again.

  The archive is named ``mongodb-logfiles_<instance_or_process>_<ISO8601_Format_Date>.tar.gz``.

  The extracted files use the following directory structure:

  .. code-block:: sh

     <host>
       automation_agent
         automation-agent-verbose.log
         automation-agent-verbose.log.<ISO8601_Format_Date>
       backup_agent
         backup-agent-verbose.log

           mongodb.log.<ISO8601_Format_Date>

  .. note::

     When you extract the ``tar`` archive on a Microsoft Windows host,
     use an archive extraction utility that supports `PAX extended
     headers <https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/PAX-keywords.html>`_.
     Some Windows archive utilities have issues with PAX extended
     headers for ``tar``.


  Collected logs expire and are removed after 7 days. To extend the
  lifetime of a particular log file, click the :guilabel:`extend` link
  for that archive on the :guilabel:`Log Request History` page.
