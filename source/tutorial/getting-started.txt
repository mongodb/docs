.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MMS is a service that creates and manages MongoDB deployments. You can
use MMS to deploy MongoDB locally, on a network, or directly on
Amazon's EC2 service. MMS can manage any or all of your development,
testing, or production MMS deployments.

The *getting started* procedure guides you through creating your first
MMS-managed deployment. As part of this procedure, you must decide
what kind of MongoDB system you want to deploy: standalone, replica
set, or sharded cluster. Also, you must decide if you want to install
MongoDB on your local system, your existing infrastructure or using
AWS systems.

Later, you can create multiple deployments with entirely different
configurations. MMS provides an interface end for many administrative
operations, including: adding capacity, managing authentication and
users, and retiring servers.
