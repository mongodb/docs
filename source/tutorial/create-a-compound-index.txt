Create a Compound Index
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Indexes allow MongoDB to process and fulfill queries quickly by
creating small and efficient representations of the documents in a
:term:`collection`. MongoDB supports indexes that include content on a
single field, as well as :ref:`compound indexes <index-type-compound>`
that include content from multiple fields. Continue reading for
instructions and examples of building a compound index.

Build a Compound Index
----------------------

To create a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` use an
operation that resembles the following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 } )

.. include:: /includes/fact-index-specification-field-value.rst

Example
-------

The following operation will create an index on the
``item``, ``category``, and ``price`` fields of the ``products``
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.ensureIndex( { item: 1, category: 1, price: 1 } )
