   The ability to provision MongoDB servers in :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web
   Services)` using |mms| has been retired.

   - Any existing clusters continue as they are.

   - :abbr:`DNS (Domain Name Service)` entries for any existing servers will
     continue to work until at least January 1, 2023.

   - |mms| can manage hosts provisioned directly through :abbr:`AWS (Amazon
     Web Services)`. See :doc:`/tutorial/add-servers-automation`.

   - If you are interested in fully managed provisioning on 
     :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)`, evaluate
     `MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/>`_.
