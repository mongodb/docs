"A *priority 0* member is a secondary that **cannot** become "
":term:`primary`. *Priority 0* members cannot *trigger* :term:`elections "
"<election>`.  Otherwise these members function as normal secondaries. A "
"*priority 0* member maintains a copy of the data set, accepts read "
"operations, and votes in elections. Configure a *priority 0* member to "
"prevent :term:`secondaries <secondary>` from becoming primary, which is "
"particularly useful in multi-data center deployments."

"A *priority 0* member can function as a standby. In some replica sets, it"
" might not be possible to add a new member in a reasonable amount of "
"time. A standby member keeps a current copy of the data to be able to "
"replace an unavailable member."

"In many cases, you need not set standby to *priority 0*. However, in sets"
" with varied hardware or :ref:`geographic distribution <replica-set-"
