Authenticate to MongoDB with the Java Driver
============================================

This page is a brief overview of authenticating to a MongoDB cluster
with the MongoDB Java Driver using version 2.11.0 and above.

Normal Authentication
---------------------

To authenticate as the user "user1" with a password of "password1",
defined in the "test" database:

.. code-block:: java

   import com.mongodb.MongoClient;
   import com.mongodb.MongoCredential;
   import com.mongodb.ServerAddress;

   // using release 2.13 or later
   MongoCredential credential = MongoCredential.createCredential("user1", "test", "password1".toCharArray());

   // using release 2.11 or 2.12
   MongoCredential credential = MongoCredential.createMongoCRCredential("user1", "test", "password1".toCharArray());

   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(new ServerAddress(server), Arrays.asList(credential));

In some cases you may need to authenticate as multiple users in
different databases.  For example, imagine a map/reduce job that reads
from the database "first" and writes the results to the database
"second".  You may have to authenticate one user defined in the
"first" database and another in the "second":

.. code-block:: java

   MongoCredential credentialOne = MongoCredential.createCredential("user1", "first", "password1".toCharArray());
   MongoCredential credentialTwo = MongoCredential.createCredential("user2", "second", "password2".toCharArray());

   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(new ServerAddress(server), Arrays.asList(credentialOne, credentialTwo));

.. note::

   As of the 2.4 MongoDB release, this is no long necessary, since you
   are able to define a user in one database and delegate privileges
   for that user in another database.
   
MONGODB-X509 Authentication
---------------------------

The MONGODB-X509 mechanism authenticates a user whose name is derived from the distinguished subject name of the X.509 certificate presented by the driver during SSL negotiation.
This authentication method requires the use of SSL connections with certificate validation and is available in MongoDB 2.6 and newer:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoCredential credential = MongoCredential.MongoCredential.createMongoX509Credential("<X.509 derived username>");

   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(new ServerAddress(server), Arrays.asList(credential), MongoClientOptions.builder().sslEnabled(true).build());

GSSAPI (Kerberos) Authentication
-------------------------------

.. note::

   These features are only present in `MongoDB Enterprise
   <https://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise>`_.

.. important:: The Java driver maintainers have only confirmed the content of this
   document on Linux using Java 6 and Java 7, on OS X using Java 7,
   and on Windows with SSPI using Java 7.

To authenticate to a MongoDB cluster using Kerberos, you must supply
the Kerberos user name and specify the Kerberos authentication
mechanism:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoCredential credential = MongoCredential.createGSSAPICredential("user1@MYREALM.ME");

   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(new ServerAddress(server), Arrays.asList(credential));

.. note::

   With Kerberos you specify neither the password not the database
   name.

To actually run a program that authenticates with Kerberos, you
typically will need to specify several system properties so that the
underlying GSSAPI Java libraries can acquire a Kerberos ticket:

.. code-block:: properties

   java.security.krb5.realm=MYREALM.ME
   java.security.krb5.kdc=mykdc.myrealm.me
