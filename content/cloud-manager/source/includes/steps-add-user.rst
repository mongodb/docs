   .. step:: Specify User or Team.
      
      - To add an individual user:
      
        a. Select :guilabel:`Invite Users` from the :guilabel:`Manage`
           button menu.
      
        b. From the :guilabel:`Add Users` page, enter the new user's
           email address or |jira| username in the combo box.
      
           If the console finds a connected |jira| account, |mms|
           invites the user to the |mms|  project. If the user accepts
           the invite, that user is added to the corresponding |jira|
           group.
      
           After typing in the email address or |jira| username, either
           press :guilabel:`Enter` or click on the email address or
           |jira| username beneath the :guilabel:`New User` header under
           the combo box.
      
        c. Repeat for any additional users.
      
      - To add a team:
      
        a. Select :guilabel:`Create Team` from the :guilabel:`Manage`
           button menu.
      
        b. Enter the team's name in the :guilabel:`Name Your Team` box.
      
        c. Enter the new team member's email address or |jira| username
           in the :guilabel:`Add Members` combo box.
      
           If the console finds a connected |jira| account, |mms|
           invites the user to the |mms|  project. If the user accepts
           the invite, that user is added to the corresponding |jira|
           group.
      
           After typing in the email address or |jira| username, either
           press :guilabel:`Enter` or click on the email address or
           |jira| username beneath the :guilabel:`New User` header under
           the combo box.
      
        d. Repeat for any additional team members.
      
   .. step:: Choose the new roles for the User or Team.
      
      By default, each user and team is given the ``Project
      Member`` role. To change or add additional roles for each user or
      team, click on the role dropdown menu, then select the checkboxes for
      each :ref:`role <project-roles>` you want the user or team to
      have in the project.
      
      All team members share the roles assigned to the team on this
      project.
      
   .. step:: Invite the Users or Create the Teams.
      
      - For a new user, click :guilabel:`Add Users to Project`.
      
        |mms| sends an e-mail to the selected users inviting them to join
        the project. Invited users do not have access to the project until
        they accept the invitation. Invitations expire after 30 days.
      
      - For a new team, click :guilabel:`Create Team`.
