This procedure requires the Enterprise edition of the `MySQL ODBC
driver <https://www.mysql.com/downloads/>`_. MySQL Enterprise uses
OpenSSL, which is compatible with |bic| for TLS/SSL connections.

If you have a community edition of the driver, to install the
Enterprise edition for the same driver version, you must uninstall
the community edition. To uninstall, you can either:

- Remove the driver by using the .msi for community edition.

- Remove the driver from the :guilabel:`Control Panel` >
  :guilabel:`Programs and Features` screen.
