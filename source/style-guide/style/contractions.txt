Contractions help to create a less formal tone in documentation. Common
contractions, such as *can’t* and *don’t*, are usually recognizable by
readers who are proficient in English, and such contractions don't pose
a problem for human translators.

In general, you can use the following common contractions in content
where contractions are acceptable:

-  Contractions that include the word *not*, such as *aren’t*, *can’t*,
   *didn’t*, *doesn’t*, *don’t*, *isn’t*, *wasn’t*, *weren’t*, *won’t*,
   and *wouldn’t*

   If you want to emphasize the negative, however, do *not* use such a
   contraction.

-  Contractions that include *is* or *are*, such as *it’s*, *that’s*,
   *there’s*, *they’re*, and *you’re*

   Because such contractions can be confused with possessives, ensure
   that your usage is correct.

Avoid the following types of contractions, which aren't common or can
be confusing depending on context:

-  Contractions that can be misread as other words, such as *let’s*
-  Contractions with the interrogative words *how*, *what*, *when*,
   *where*, *who*, and *why*
-  Nonstandard or obscure contractions, such as *mustn’t*, *mightn’t*,
   *should’ve*, *could’ve*, and *that’ll*
-  Contractions that combine a noun and a verb, such as in “The
   service’ll stop automatically”
-  Contractions that include a company name, product name, or
   trademark, such as in “MongoDB’s the leader in hybrid cloud”

Use contractions consistently. Avoid mixing common contractions and
spelled-out forms within the same article or set of related articles.
