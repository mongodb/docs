This page lists the available Global |api| Keys for this |onprem|
instance. You can:

- Search for an |api| Key,
- Add new |api| Keys,
- Edit existing |api| Keys, or
- Delete existing |api| Keys.

.. note::

   |mms| limits all actions in this section to users or Global |api|
   Keys that were granted the :authrole:`Global Owner` role.

.. _add-global-api-key:

Add a Global |api| Key
----------------------

1. Click :guilabel:`Create API Key` to open the :guilabel:`Add API Key`
   page.

#. At the :guilabel:`Enter API Key Information` step, set both required
   values in the Global |api| Key form:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 80
      :stub-columns: 1

      * - Description
        - Type the purpose this Global |api| Key serves. This
          description can't be longer than 250 characters.
      * - Global Permissions
        - Select the :ref:`new role or roles <global-roles>` to be
          assigned to the |api| Key.

   |mms| generates the Public Key at this step.

#. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

#. At the :guilabel:`Private Key` step, click the :guilabel:`Copy`
   button to add the Private Key to the clipboard. Save and secure this
   Private Key as you would any other password. To use your Global
   |api| Key with the |mms| |api|, you need both the public key, which
   serves as a username, and the private key, which serves as a
   password.

   .. warning::

      Copy your full private key at this point. Store it in a secure
      location. |mms| doesn't and can't display the full private key
      after you leave this page.

#. To :ref:`add an access list entry <add-global-access-list-entry>`, click
   :guilabel:`Go to Global Access List`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Done`.

.. _edit-global-api-key:

Edit a Global |api| Key
-----------------------

.. warning::

   Once saved, any changes to these permissions impact applications
   that use this Global |api| Key.

1. To the right of the Global |api| Key that you want to edit, click
   :icon-mms:`ellipsis` then select :guilabel:`Edit API Key` to open
   the :guilabel:`Edit Global API Key` modal. |mms| displays the
   Public Key in this modal.

#. Change the values in the Global |api| Key form as needed:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 80
      :stub-columns: 1

      * - Description
        - Type the purpose this Global |api| Key serves. This
          description can't be longer than 250 characters.
      * - Global Permissions
        - Select the :ref:`new role or roles <global-roles>` to be
          assigned to the |api| Key.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save` if you made changes to your Global |api|
   Key. Click :guilabel:`Cancel` to close the page without editing the
   Global |api| Key.

.. _delete-global-api-key:

Delete a Global |api| Key
-------------------------

.. warning::

   Deleting a Global |api| Key might impact applications that use that
   key.

1. To the right of the Global |api| Key that you want to delete, click
   :icon-mms:`ellipsis` then select :guilabel:`Delete API Key` to open
   the :guilabel:`Delete Global API Key` modal.

#. Type the public key for the Global |api| Key in the box to confirm
   that you want to delete this key.

#. Click :guilabel:`Delete` to delete your Global |api|
   Key. Click :guilabel:`Cancel` to close the modal without deleting
   the Global |api| Key.
