  #     The ``mongo`` shell is packaged with the MongoDB Server
  #     Community and Enterprise distributions, and is also available
  #     for users of Atlas as a client-only download.

  #     MongoDB binaries are located in a directory that starts with
  #     "mongodb-". You should see a file named ``mongo``, which is
  #     the shell executable.

  #     If you do not have ``mongo`` shell installed, follow the
  #     install directions for your environment.
