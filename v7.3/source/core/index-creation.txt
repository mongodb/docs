Index builds use an optimized build process that holds an exclusive lock on the 
collection at the beginning and end of the index build. The rest of the build 
process yields to interleaving read and write operations. For a detailed 
description of index build process and locking behavior, see 
:ref:`index-build-process`.

Index builds on a replica set or sharded cluster build simultaneously across 
all data-bearing replica set members. The primary requires a minimum number of 
data-bearing voting members (i.e. commit quorum), including itself, that must 
complete the build before marking the index as ready for use. A "voting" member 
is any replica set member where :rsconf:`members[n].votes` is greater than
``0``. See :ref:`index-operations-replicated-build` for more
information.

Behavior
--------

Comparison to Foreground and Background Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previous versions of MongoDB supported building indexes either in the
foreground or background. Foreground index builds were fast and produced
more efficient index data structures, but required blocking all
read-write access to the parent database of the collection being indexed
for the duration of the build. Background index builds were slower and
had less efficient results, but allowed read-write access to the
database and its collections during the build process.

Index builds now obtain an exclusive lock on only the collection being indexed 
during the start and end of the build process to protect metadata changes. 
The rest of the build process uses the yielding behavior of background index 
builds to maximize read-write access to the collection during the build. 
Index builds still produce efficient index data structures despite the more 
permissive locking behavior.

The optimized index build performance is at least on par with background
index builds. For workloads with few or no updates received during the
build process, optimized index builds can be as fast as a foreground
index build on that same data.

Use :method:`db.currentOp()` to monitor  the progress of ongoing index
builds. 

MongoDB ignores the ``background`` index build option if specified to
:dbcommand:`createIndexes` or its shell helpers
:method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` and
:method:`~db.collection.createIndexes()`.

.. _index-build-constraint-violation:

Constraint Violations During Index Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For indexes that enforce constraints on the collection, such as
:ref:`unique <index-type-unique>` indexes, the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
checks all pre-existing and concurrently-written documents for
violations of those constraints *after* the index build completes.
Documents that violate the index constraints can exist during the index
build. If any documents violate the index constraints at the end of the
build, the ``mongod`` terminates the build and throws an
error.

For example, consider a populated collection ``inventory``. An
administrator wants to create a unique index on the ``product_sku``
field. If any documents in the collection have duplicate values for
``product_sku``, the index build can still start successfully. 
If any violations still exist at the end of the build, 
the ``mongod`` terminates the build and throws an error. 

Similarly, an application can successfully write documents to the
``inventory`` collection with duplicate values of ``product_sku`` while
the index build is in progress. If any violations still exist at the end
of the build,  the ``mongod`` terminates the build and throws
an error. 

To mitigate the risk of index build failure due to constraint
violations:

- Validate that no documents in the collection violate the index
  constraints.

- Stop all writes to the collection from applications that cannot
  guarantee violation-free write operations.

.. _index-build-constraint-violation-sharded:

Sharded Collections
````````````````````

For a sharded collection distributed across multiple shards, one or
more shards may contain a chunk with duplicate documents. As such, the
create index operation may succeed on some of the shards (i.e. the ones
without duplicates) but not on others (i.e. the ones with duplicates).
To avoid leaving inconsistent indexes across shards, you can issue the
:method:`db.collection.dropIndex()` from a :binary:`~bin.mongos` to
drop the index from the collection.

To mitigate the risk of this occurrence, before creating the index:

- Validate that no documents in the collection violate the index
  constraints.

- Stop all writes to the collection from applications that cannot
  guarantee violation-free write operations.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`index-creation-index-consistency`

Maximum Concurrent Index Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the server allows up to three concurrent index builds. To
change the number of allowed concurrent index builds, modify the
:parameter:`maxNumActiveUserIndexBuilds` parameter.

If the number of concurrent index builds reaches the limit specified by
``maxNumActiveUserIndexBuilds``, the server blocks additional index
builds until the number of concurrent index builds drops below the
limit.

Index Build Impact on Database Performance
------------------------------------------

Index Builds During Write-Heavy Workloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building indexes during time periods where the target collection
is under heavy write load can result in reduced write 
performance and longer index builds.

Consider designating a maintenance window during which applications
stop or reduce write operations against the collection. Start the
index build during this maintenance window to mitigate the
potential negative impact of the build process.

Insufficient Available System Memory (RAM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-index-build-default-memory-limit.rst

If the host machine has limited available free RAM, you may need
to schedule a maintenance period to increase the total system RAM
before you can modify the ``mongod`` RAM usage.

Index Builds in Replicated Environments

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-index-builds-simultaneous-nolink.rst

.. include:: /includes/unreachable-node-default-quorum-index-builds.rst 

The build process is summarized as follows:

1. The primary receives the :dbcommand:`createIndexes` command and 
   immediately creates a "startIndexBuild" oplog entry associated with
   the index build.

#. The secondaries start the index build after they replicate the 
   "startIndexBuild" oplog entry.

#. Each member "votes" to commit the build once it finishes indexing 
   data in the collection. 
   
#. Secondary members continue to process any new write operations into
   the index while waiting for the primary to confirm a quorum of votes.

#. When the primary has a quorum of votes, it checks for any key
   constraint violations such as duplicate key errors.

   - If there are no key constraint violations, the primary completes
     the index build, marks the index as ready for use, and creates an
     associated "commitIndexBuild" oplog entry.

   - If there are any key constraint violations, the index build 
     fails. The primary aborts the index build and creates an 
     associated "abortIndexBuild" oplog entry.

#. The secondaries replicate the "commitIndexBuild" oplog entry and 
   complete the index build.

   If the secondaries instead replicate an "abortIndexBuild" oplog 
   entry, they abort the index build and discard the build job.

For sharded clusters, the index build occurs only on shards
containing data for the collection being indexed.

For a more detailed description of the index build process, 
see :ref:`index-build-process`.

By default, index builds use a commit quorum of ``"votingMembers"``, or
all data-bearing voting members. To start an index build with a
non-default commit quorum, specify the :ref:`commitQuorum
<createIndexes-cmd-commitQuorum>` parameter to
:dbcommand:`createIndexes` or its shell helpers
:method:`db.collection.createIndex()` and
:method:`db.collection.createIndexes()`.

To modify the commit quorum required for an in-progress simultaneous
index build, use the :dbcommand:`setIndexCommitQuorum` command.

.. note::

   Index builds can impact replica set performance. For workloads which
   cannot tolerate performance decrease due to index builds, consider
   performing a rolling index build process. Rolling index builds take
   at most one replica set member out at a time, starting with the
   secondary members, and builds the index on that member as a
   standalone. Rolling index builds require at least one replica set
   election. 

   - For rolling index builds on replica sets, see
     :doc:`/tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets`.

   - For rolling index builds on sharded clusters, see
     :doc:`/tutorial/build-indexes-on-sharded-clusters`.

Commit Quorum Contrasted with Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _index-operations-build-failure:

Build Failure and Recovery
--------------------------

Interrupted Index Builds on a Primary ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, if the primary ``mongod`` 
performs a clean :dbcommand:`shutdown` with ``"force" : true`` or 
receives a ``SIGTERM`` signal during an index build and the 
:ref:`commitQuorum <createIndexes-cmd-commitQuorum>` is set to the 
default ``votingMembers``, then the index build progress is saved to 
disk. The ``mongod`` automatically recovers the index 
build when it is restarted and continues from the saved checkpoint. 
In earlier versions, if the index build is interrupted, it has to 
be restarted from the beginning.

Interrupted Index Builds on a Secondary ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, if a secondary ``mongod`` performs 
a clean :dbcommand:`shutdown` with ``"force" : true`` or receives a 
``SIGTERM`` signal during an index build and the 
:ref:`commitQuorum <createIndexes-cmd-commitQuorum>` is set to the
default ``votingMembers``, then the index build progress is saved to
disk. The ``mongod`` automatically recovers the index build
when it is restarted and continues from the saved checkpoint. In earlier
versions, if the index build is interrupted, it has to be restarted from 
the beginning.

The ``mongod`` can perform the startup process while the 
recovering index builds.

If you restart the ``mongod`` as a standalone (i.e. removing
or commenting out :setting:`replication.replSetName` or omitting
:option:`--replSetName <mongod --replSet>`), the ``mongod``
cannot restart the index build. The build remains in a paused 
state until it is manually :dbcommand:`dropped <dropIndexes>`.

Interrupted Index Builds on Standalone ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ``mongod`` shuts down during the index build, the
index build job and all progress is lost. Restarting the
``mongod`` does not restart the index build. You must
re-issue the :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` operation to restart
the index build.

Rollbacks during Build Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, if a node is rolled back to a prior state
during the index build, the index build progress is saved to disk. If
there is still work to be done when the rollback concludes, the
``mongod`` automatically recovers the index build and
continues from the saved checkpoint.

MongoDB can pause an in-progress index build to perform a 
:ref:`rollback <replica-set-rollbacks>`.

- If the rollback does not revert the index build, MongoDB restarts 
  the index build after completing the rollback. 

- If the rollback reverts the index build, you must re-create the 
  index or indexes after the rollback completes.

.. _index-creation-index-consistency:

Index Consistency Checks for Sharded Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A sharded collection has an inconsistent index if the collection does
not have the exact same indexes (including the index options) on each
shard that contains chunks for the collection. Although inconsistent
indexes should not occur during normal operations, inconsistent indexes
can occur, such as:

- When a user is creating an index with a ``unique`` key constraint and
  one shard contains a chunk with duplicate documents. In such cases,
  the create index operation may succeed on the shards without
  duplicates but not on the shard with duplicates.

- When a user is creating an index across the shards in a :doc:`rolling
  manner (i.e. manually building the index one by one across the
  shards) </tutorial/build-indexes-on-sharded-clusters>` but either
  fails to build the index for an associated shard or incorrectly
  builds an index with different specification.

The :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>` primary periodically checks 
for index inconsistencies across the shards for sharded collections. To
configure these periodic checks, see
:parameter:`enableShardedIndexConsistencyCheck` and
:parameter:`shardedIndexConsistencyCheckIntervalMS`.

The command :dbcommand:`serverStatus` returns the field
:serverstatus:`shardedIndexConsistency` to report on index
inconsistencies when run on the config server primary.

To check if a sharded collection has inconsistent indexes, see
:ref:`manage-indexes-find-inconsistent-indexes`.

Monitor In Progress Index Builds
--------------------------------

To see the status of an index build operation, you can use the
:method:`db.currentOp()` method in :binary:`~bin.mongosh`. To
filter the current operations for index creation operations, see
:ref:`currentOp-index-creation` for an example.

The :data:`~currentOp.msg` field includes a percentage-complete
measurement of the current stage in the index build process. 

Observe Stopped and Resumed Index Builds in the Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While an index is being built, progress is written to the 
:ref:`MongoDB log<log-messages-ref>`. If an index build is
stopped and resumed there will be log messages with fields like these:

.. code-block:: bash
   :copyable: false

    "msg":"Index build: wrote resumable state to disk",
   
    "msg":"Found index from unfinished build",

Terminate In Progress Index Builds
----------------------------------

Use the :dbcommand:`dropIndexes` command or its shell helpers
:method:`~db.collection.dropIndex()` or
:method:`~db.collection.dropIndexes()` to terminate an in-progress index
build. See :ref:`dropIndexes-cmd-index-builds` for more information.

Do *not* use :dbcommand:`killOp` to terminate an in-progress index
builds in replica sets or sharded clusters. 

.. _index-build-process:

Index Build Process
-------------------

The following table describes each stage of the index build
process:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 30 70

  * - Stage
    - Description

  * - Lock

    - The ``mongod`` obtains an exclusive ``X`` lock on the
      the collection being indexed. This blocks all read and write 
      operations on the collection, including the application
      of any replicated write operations or metadata commands that
      target the collection. The ``mongod`` does not yield 
      this lock. 

  * - Initialization

    - The ``mongod`` creates three data structures 
      at this initial state:

      - The initial index metadata entry.
      - A temporary table ("side writes table") that stores keys
        generated from writes to the collection being indexed
        during the build process.
      - A temporary table ("constraint violation table") for all 
        documents that may cause a key generation error. Key
        generation errors occur when a document has invalid keys for the
        indexed fields. For example, a document with duplicate field
        values when building a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>`
        *or* malformed :ref:`GeoJSON objects <geospatial-geojson>` when
        building a :ref:`2dsphere index <2dsphere-index>`.

  * - Lock

    - The ``mongod`` downgrades the exclusive ``X`` 
      collection lock to an intent exclusive
      ``IX`` lock. The ``mongod`` periodically yields
      this lock to  interleaving read and write operations.

  * - Scan Collection

    - For each document in the collection, the ``mongod`` 
      generates a key for that document and dumps the 
      key into an external sorter.

      If the ``mongod`` encounters a key generation
      error while generating a key during the collection scan,
      it stores that key in the constraint violation table for later
      processing.

      If the ``mongod`` encounters any other error while
      generating a key, the build fails with an error.

      Once the ``mongod`` completes the collection
      scan, it dumps the sorted keys into the index.

  * - Process Side Writes Table

    - The ``mongod`` drains the side write table using
      first-in-first-out priority.

      If the ``mongod`` encounters a key generation error
      while processing a key in the side write table, it stores that key
      in the constraint violation table for later processing.

      If the ``mongod`` encounters any other error while
      processing a key, the build fails with an error.

      For each document written to the collection during the build
      process, the ``mongod`` generates a key for that
      document and stores it in the side write table for later
      processing. The ``mongod`` uses a snapshot system to
      set a limit to the number of keys to process. 

  * - Vote and Wait for Commit Quorum

    - A ``mongod`` that is *not* part of a replica set 
      skips this stage.

      The ``mongod`` submits a "vote" to the primary to commit the 
      index. Specifically, it writes the "vote" to an internal replicated 
      collection on the :term:`primary`.
      
      If the ``mongod`` is the :term:`primary`, it waits
      until it has a commit quorum of votes (all voting data-bearing
      members by default) before continuing the index build process.
      
      If the ``mongod`` is a :term:`secondary`, it waits
      until it replicates either a "commitIndexBuild" or 
      "abortIndexBuild" oplog entry:

      - If the ``mongod`` replicates a "commitIndexBuild" 
        oplog entry, it finishes draining the side writes table and 
        moves to the next stage in the index build process. 

      - If the ``mongod`` replicates an "abortIndexBuild"
        oplog entry, it aborts the index build and discards the build 
        job.

      While waiting for commit quorum, the ``mongod`` adds
      any additional keys generated from write operations to the
      collection being indexed to the side writes table and periodically
      drains the table.

  * - Lock

    - The ``mongod`` upgrades the intent exclusive ``IX`` 
      lock on the collection to a shared ``S`` lock. This 
      blocks all write operations to the collection, including the
      application of any replicated write operations or metadata
      commands that target the collection.

  * - Finish Processing Temporary Side Writes Table

    - The ``mongod`` continues draining remaining 
      records in the side writes table. The ``mongod`` may 
      pause replication  during this stage.

      If the ``mongod`` encounters a key generation error
      while processing a key in the side write table, it stores that key
      in the constraint violation table for later processing.

      If the ``mongod`` encounters any other error while
      processing a key, the build fails with an error.

  * - Lock

    - The ``mongod`` upgrades the shared ``S`` lock on the 
      collection to an exclusive ``X`` lock on the collection. This 
      blocks all read and write operations on the collection, including 
      the application of any replicated write operations or metadata 
      commands that target the collection. The ``mongod`` 
      does not yield this lock. 

  * - Drop Side Write Table

    - The ``mongod`` applies any remaining 
      operations in the side writes table before dropping it. 

      If the ``mongod`` encounters a key generation error
      while processing a key in the side write table, it stores that key
      in the constraint violation table for later processing.

      If the ``mongod`` encounters any other error while
      processing a key, the build fails with an error.

      At this point, the index includes all data written to
      the collection.

  * - Process Constraint Violation Table

    - If the ``mongod`` is the :term:`primary`, it drains the
      constraint violation table using first-in-first-out priority.

      - If no keys in the constraint violation table produce a key
        generation error *or* if the table is empty, the
        ``mongod`` drops the table and creates a
        "commitIndexBuild" oplog entry. Secondaries can complete the
        associated index build after replicating the oplog entry. 

      - If any key in the constraint violation table still produces a
        key generation error, the ``mongod`` aborts the build
        and throws an error. The ``mongod`` creates an 
        associated "abortIndexBuild" oplog entry to indicate that 
        secondaries should abort and discard the index build job.

      If the ``mongod`` is a :term:`secondary`, it drops 
      the constraint violation table. Since the primary *must* 
      successfully drain the constraint violation table prior to 
      creating the "commitOplogEntry" oplog entry, the secondary
      can safely assume that no violations exist.

  * - Mark the Index as Ready

    - .. _index-build-process-ready:

      The ``mongod`` updates the index metadata to 
      mark the index as ready for use.     

  * - Lock

    - The ``mongod`` releases the ``X`` lock on the 
      collection.
