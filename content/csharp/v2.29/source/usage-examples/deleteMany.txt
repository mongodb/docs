You can delete more than one document using the ``DeleteMany()`` synchronous
method or the ``DeleteManyAsync()`` asynchronous method on a collection object.

Example
-------

The following code deletes all documents in the ``restaurants`` collection whose 
``borough`` field value equals the word "Brooklyn".

Select the :guilabel:`Asynchronous` or :guilabel:`Synchronous` tab to see the corresponding 
code.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: delete-many-async

      .. literalinclude:: ../includes/code-examples/delete-many/DeleteManyAsync.cs
         :start-after: start-delete-many-async
         :end-before: end-delete-many-async
         :language:  csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

      For a fully runnable example of the ``DeleteManyAsync()`` operation, see the
      `DeleteManyAsync code sample <{+example+}/delete-many/DeleteManyAsync.cs>`__.

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: delete-many-sync

      .. literalinclude:: ../includes/code-examples/delete-many/DeleteMany.cs
         :start-after: start-delete-many-builders
         :end-before: end-delete-many-builders
         :language:  csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:
      
      For a fully runnable example of the ``DeleteMany()`` operation, see the
      `DeleteMany code sample <{+example+}/delete-many/DeleteMany.cs>`__.

Expected Result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Running either of the preceding full examples prints the following results:

.. code-block:: none

   Deleting documents...
   Deleted documents: 6086
   Resetting sample data...done.
