Definition
----------

.. expression:: $bsonSize

   .. versionadded:: 4.4

   Returns the size in bytes of a given document (i.e. bsontype
   ``Object``) when encoded as :term:`BSON`. You can use
   :expression:`$bsonSize` as an alternative to the
   :ref:`Object.bsonSize() <shell-quick-ref-misc>` method.

   :expression:`$bsonSize` has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $bsonSize: <object> }

   The argument can be any valid :ref:`expression
   <aggregation-expressions>` as long as it resolves to either an object
   or ``null``. For more information on expressions, see
   :ref:`aggregation-expressions`.

Behavior
--------

If the argument is an object, the expression returns the size of the
object in bytes when the object is encoded as :term:`BSON`. 

If the argument is ``null``, the expression returns ``null``.

If the argument resolves to a data type other than an object or
``null``, :expression:`$bsonSize` errors.

Examples
--------

Return Sizes of Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, create a sample collection named
``employees`` with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.employees.insertMany([
     {
       "_id": 1,
       "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@company.com", "position": "Software Developer",
       "current_task": {
         "project_id": 1,
         "project_name": "Aggregation Improvements",
         "project_duration": 5,
         "hours": 20
       }
     },
     {
       "_id": 2,
       "name": "Bob", "email": "bob@company.com", "position": "Sales",
       "current_task": {
         "project_id": 2,
         "project_name": "Write Blog Posts",
         "project_duration": 2,
         "hours": 10,
         "notes": "Progress is slow. Waiting for feedback."
       }
     },
     {
       "_id": 3,
       "name": "Charlie", "email": "charlie@company.com", "position": "HR (On Leave)",
       "current_task": null
     },
     {
       "_id": 4,
       "name": "Dianne", "email": "diane@company.com", "position": "Web Designer",
       "current_task": {
         "project_id": 3,
         "project_name": "Update Home Page",
         "notes": "Need to scope this project."
       }
     }
  ]);

The following aggregation :pipeline:`projects <$project>`:

- The ``name`` field

- The ``object_size`` field, which uses :expression:`$bsonSize`
  to return the size of the document in bytes. The
  :variable:`$$ROOT <ROOT>` variable references the document currently
  being processed by the pipeline. To learn more about variables in the
  aggregation pipeline, see :doc:`/reference/aggregation-variables`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.employees.aggregate([
     {
       "$project": {
         "name": 1,
         "object_size": { $bsonSize: "$$ROOT" } 
       } 
     }
   ])

The operation returns the following result:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Alice", "object_size" : 222 }
   { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Bob", "object_size" : 248 }
   { "_id" : 3, "name" : "Charlie", "object_size" : 112 }
   { "_id" : 4, "name" : "Dianne", "object_size" : 207 }

Return Combined Size of All Documents in a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following pipeline returns the combined size of all of the
documents in the ``employees`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.employees.aggregate([
     {
       "$group": {
         "_id": null,
         "combined_object_size": { $sum: { $bsonSize: "$$ROOT" } } 
       } 
     }
   ])

When you specify an :pipeline:`$group` _id value of ``null``, or any
other constant value, the :pipeline:`$group` stage calculates
accumulated values for all the input documents as a whole.

The operation uses the :group:`$sum` operator to calculate the combined
:expression:`$bsonSize` of each document in the collection. The
:variable:`$$ROOT <ROOT>` variable references the document currently
being processed by the pipeline. To learn more about variables in the
aggregation pipeline, see :doc:`/reference/aggregation-variables`.

The operation returns the following result:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : null, "combined_object_size" : 789 }

.. seealso::

   - :pipeline:`$group`
   - :group:`$sum`

Return Document with Largest Specified Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following pipeline returns the document with the largest
``current_task`` field in bytes:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   db.employees.aggregate([
      // First Stage
      { $project: { name: "$name", task_object_size: { $bsonSize: "$current_task" } }  },
      // Second Stage
      { $sort: { "task_object_size" : -1 } },
      // Third Stage
      { $limit: 1 }
   ])

First Stage
  The first stage of the pipeline :pipeline:`projects <$project>`:
  
  - The ``name`` field

  - The ``task_object_size`` field, which uses :expression:`$bsonSize`
    to return the size of the document's ``current_task`` field in
    bytes.

  This stage outputs the following documents to the next stage:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :copyable: false

     { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Alice", "task_object_size" : 109 }
     { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Bob", "task_object_size" : 152 }
     { "_id" : 3, "name" : "Charlie", "task_object_size" : null }
     { "_id" : 4, "name" : "Dianne", "task_object_size" : 99 }

Second Stage
  The second stage :pipeline:`sorts <$sort>` the documents by
  ``task_object_size`` in descending order.

  This stage outputs the following documents to the next stage:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :copyable: false

     { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Bob", "task_object_size" : 152 }
     { "_id" : 1, "name" : "Alice", "task_object_size" : 109 }
     { "_id" : 4, "name" : "Dianne", "task_object_size" : 99 }
     { "_id" : 3, "name" : "Charlie", "task_object_size" : null }

Third Stage
  The third stage :pipeline:`limits <$limit>` the output documents to
  only return the document appearing first in the sort order:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :copyable: false

     { "_id" : 2, "name" : "Bob", "task_object_size" : 152 }

.. seealso::

   - :pipeline:`$project`
   - :pipeline:`$sort`
   - :pipeline:`$limit`
   - :expression:`$strLenBytes`
   - :expression:`$binarySize`
