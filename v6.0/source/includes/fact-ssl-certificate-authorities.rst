For production use, your MongoDB deployment should use valid
certificates generated and signed by a certificate authority. You or
your organization can generate and maintain an independent certificate
authority, or use certificates generated by third-party TLS vendors.
Obtaining and managing certificates is beyond the scope of this
documentation.
