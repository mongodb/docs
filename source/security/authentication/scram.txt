Overview
--------

**Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM)** is a family of
authentication mechanisms that use a challenge-response mechanism to authenticate
the user. SCRAM-SHA-256, which uses the SHA-256 algorithm to hash your password, is the
default authentication mechanism in {+mdb-server+} version 4.0
and later. SCRAM-SHA-1, which uses the SHA-1 algorithm instead, is the default
authentication mechanism in {+mdb-server+} versions earlier than 4.0.

You can use SCRAM to authenticate to MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB
Enterprise Advanced, and MongoDB Community Edition.

.. tip:: SCRAM Mechanisms

   To learn more about the SCRAM family of authentication mechanisms, see
   `RFC 5802 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`__ and
   :wikipedia:`Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism <Salted_Challenge_Response_Authentication_Mechanism>`
   on Wikipedia.

   For more information about the MongoDB implementation of SCRAM, see
   :manual:`SCRAM </core/security-scram>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

SCRAM-SHA-256
-------------

SCRAM-SHA-256, as defined by `RFC 7677 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7677>`__,
is the default authentication mechanism for MongoDB deployments.

To authenticate with this mechanism, set the following connection options:

- ``username``: The username to authenticate. Percent-encode this value before including
  it in a connection URI.
- ``password``: The password to authenticate. Percent-encode this value before including
  it in a connection URI.
- ``authSource``: The MongoDB database to authenticate against. By default, the
  {+php-library+} authenticates against the database in the connection
  URI, if you include one. If you don't, it authenticates against the ``admin`` database.

You can set these options in two ways: by passing an options array to the
``MongoDB\Client`` constructor or through parameters in your connection URI.
Select the :guilabel:`MongoDB\\Client` or :guilabel:`Connection URI` tab to
see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-default-client
         :end-before: end-default-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-default-uri
         :end-before: end-default-uri

You can also explicitly specify the ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` authentication mechanism
by setting the ``authMechanism`` connection option to ``'SCRAM-SHA-256'``, as
shown in the following example:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-scram-sha-256-client
         :end-before: end-scram-sha-256-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-scram-sha-256-uri
         :end-before: end-scram-sha-256-uri

SCRAM-SHA-1
-----------

``SCRAM-SHA-1``, as defined by `RFC 5802 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5802>`__, 
is a Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) that uses your
username and password, encrypted with the ``SHA-1`` algorithm, to authenticate
your user.

To authenticate with this mechanism, set the following connection options:

- ``username``: The username to authenticate. Percent-encode this value before including
  it in a connection URI.
- ``password``: The password to authenticate. Percent-encode this value before including
  it in a connection URI.
- ``authSource``: The MongoDB database to authenticate against. By default, the
  {+php-library+} authenticates against the database in the connection
  URI, if you include one. If you don't, it authenticates against the ``admin`` database.
- ``authMechanism``: Set to ``'SCRAM-SHA-1'``.

You can set these options in two ways: by passing an options array to the
``MongoDB\Client`` constructor or through parameters in your connection URI.
Select the :guilabel:`MongoDB\\Client` or :guilabel:`Connection URI` tab to
see the corresponding code:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-scram-sha-1-client
         :end-before: end-scram-sha-1-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/authentication.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-scram-sha-1-uri
         :end-before: end-scram-sha-1-uri
