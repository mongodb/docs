==================
Edit a Replica Set
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can add, remove, and reconfigure members in a :term:`replica set`
directly in the MMS console.

Procedures
----------

Add a Replica Set Member
++++++++++++++++++++++++

You must have an existing server to which to deploy the new replica set
member. The server can exist on your own system or on :doc:`Amazon Web
Services (AWS) </tutorial/add-servers>`. To add a member to an existing
replica set, increasing the size of the set:

.. include:: /includes/steps/add-replica-set-member.rst

Edit a Replica Set Member
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use this procedure to:

- Reconfigure a member as :manual:`hidden </core/replica-set-hidden-member>`

- Reconfigure a member as :manual:`delayed </core/replica-set-delayed-member>`

- Reset a member's :manual:`priority level in elections </core/replica-set-elections>`

- Reset a member's votes (for pre-2.6 versions of MongoDB)

To reconfigure a member as an :manual:`arbiter </core/replica-set-arbiter>`,
see :ref:`replace-member-with-arbiter`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/edit-replica-set-member.rst

.. _replace-member-with-arbiter:

Replace a Member with an Arbiter
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You cannot directly reconfigure a member as an arbiter. Instead, you must must
add a new member to the replica set as an arbiter. Then you must shut down an
existing secondary.

.. include:: /includes/steps/replace-member-with-arbiter.rst

Remove a Replica Set Member
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Removing a member from a replica set does not shut down the member or remove
it from MMS. MMS still monitors the :program:`mongod` as as standalone
instance. To remove a member:

.. include:: /includes/steps/remove-replica-set-member.rst

Additional Information
