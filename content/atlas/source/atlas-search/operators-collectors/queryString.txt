.. expression:: queryString

   The ``queryString`` operator supports querying a combination of
   indexed fields and values. You can perform text, wildcard, regular
   expression, fuzzy, and range searches on ``string`` fields using the 
   ``queryString`` operator.

.. _querystring-syntax:

Syntax
------

``queryString`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   {
     "$search": {
        "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
        "queryString": {
           "defaultPath": "<default-field-to-search>",
           "query": "(<field-to-search>: (<search-values>) AND|OR (<search-values>)) AND|OR (<search-values>)"
        }
     }
   }

.. _querystring-options:

Options
-------

``queryString`` uses the following terms to construct a query:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 10 60 15

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Necessity

   * - ``defaultPath``
     - string
     - The indexed field to search by default. |fts| only searches the
       field in ``defaultPath`` if you omit the field to search in the 
       ``query``.

     - yes

   * - ``query``
     - string
     - One or more indexed fields and values to search. Fields and
       values are colon-delimited. For example, to search the ``plot``
       field for the string ``baseball``, use ``plot:baseball``. The
       following operators are available to combine multiple search
       criteria:

       You can combine the fields and values using the following:

       .. list-table::
          :widths: 10 90

          * - ``AND``
            - Indicates ``AND`` boolean operator. All search values
              must be present for a document to be included in the
              results.

          * - ``OR``
            - Indicates ``OR`` boolean operator. At least one of the
              search value must be present for a document to be
              included in the results.

          * - ``NOT``
            - Indicates ``NOT`` boolean operator. Specified search 
              value must be absent for a document to be included in 
              the results.

          * - ``TO`` 
            - Indicates the range to search. You can use ``[]`` for an
              inclusive range, ``{}`` for an exclusive range, or ``{]``
              and ``[}`` for an half-open range. Any value that falls
              within the specified range must be present for a document
              to be included in the results. 

          * - ``()``
            - Delimiters for subqueries. Use the parentheses to group
              fields and values to search.

       You can run wildcard and regular expression queries using the
       following: 

       .. list-table::
          :widths: 10 90

          * - ``?``
            - Indicates any single character to match. 

          * - ``*``
            - Indicates 0 or more characters to match.

              The ``queryString`` operator doesn't support a wildcard query
              with ``*`` as the first character in the query. The
              ``queryString`` operator treats any character preceding the
              ``*`` as prefix or as characters that must exactly match. 

          * - ``/`` 
            - Delimiter for regular expression. 

          * - ``~``
            - Indicates fuzzy search to find strings which are similar
              to the search term by up to the specified number of edits.
              For example, ``{ "query":"foo":"stop"~2 }`` is equal to the following:
              
              .. code-block:: shell 
                :copyable: false
                
                { "defaultPath": "foo", "query": "stop", "maxEdits": 2 }

              The ``queryString`` operator only supports fuzzy search for
              up to at most 2 edits. Higher distances are not useful as the 
              results may match many dictionary terms. 
              
              If you use ``~`` with multiple terms in 
              a string, the ``queryString`` operator does a proximity 
              search for the terms within the specified number of terms. For example, 
              ``{ "query":"foo":"New York"~2 }`` is equal to the following:
              
              .. code-block:: shell 
                 :copyable: false

                 { "defaultPath": "foo", "query": "New York", "slop": 2 }          

          
     - yes

   * - ``score``
     - object
     - The score assigned to matching search results. You can modify
       the default score using the following options:

       - ``boost``: multiply the result score by the given number.
       - ``constant``: replace the result score with the given number.
       - ``function``: replace the result score with the given expression.
       
       .. include:: /includes/fts/facts/fact-fts-array-scoring.rst
        
       For information on using ``score`` in your query, see :ref:`scoring-ref`.

     - no

Examples
--------

The following examples use the ``movies`` collection in the
``sample_mflix`` database. If you have the :ref:`sample dataset
<available-sample-datasets>` on your {+cluster+} , you can create the
|fts| index named ``default`` with dynamic mappings and run the example 
queries on your {+cluster+}.

Boolean Operator Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic Examples 
``````````````

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: AND OR
      :tabid: beg1

      The following example uses the ``queryString`` operator to query for
      movies with the title ``Rocky`` and either ``IV``, ``4``, or
      ``Four`` at path ``title`` in the ``movies`` collection. In the
      following query, a field is specified in the ``defaultPath``,
      but no fields are specified in the ``query``. The query includes
      a :pipeline:`$project` stage to exclude all fields except
      ``title``. 

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :linenos:

         db.movies.aggregate([
           {
             $search: {
               "queryString": {
                 "defaultPath": "title",
                 "query": "Rocky AND (IV OR 4 OR Four)"
               }
             }
           },
           {
             $project: {
               "_id": 0,
               "title": 1
             }
           }
         ])

      For this query, |fts| performs a search at ``defaultPath``
      because there are no fields in the ``query``. It returns the
      following results:

      .. code-block:: json
          :copyable: false

          { "title" : "Rocky IV" }

   .. tab:: AND NOT
      :tabid: beg2

      The following example uses the ``queryString`` operator to 
      query for movies with the title ``Rocky`` and not any form of
      the numbers ``2``, ``3``, ``4``, or ``5`` at path ``title`` in
      the ``movies`` collection. In the following query, a field is
      specified in the ``defaultPath``, but no fields are specified in
      the ``query``. The query includes a :pipeline:`$project` stage 
      to exclude all fields except ``title``. 

      .. io-code-block:: 
         :copyable: true 
         
         .. input:: 
            :language: javascript
            :linenos:

            db.movies.aggregate([
              {
                $search: {
                  "queryString": {
                    "defaultPath": "title",
                    "query": "Rocky AND NOT ((II OR 2 OR Two) OR (III OR 3 OR Three) OR (IV OR 4 OR Four) OR (V OR 5 OR Five))"
                  }
                }
              },
              {
                $project: {
                  "_id": 0,
                  "title": 1
                }
              }
            ])

         .. output:: 
            :language: json

            [
              { title: 'Rocky' },
              { title: 'Rocky Marciano' },
              { title: 'Rocky Balboa' },
              { title: 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' },
              { title: 'The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle' }
            ]  

   .. tab:: AND 
      :tabid: beg3

      The following example uses the ``queryString`` operator to query
      a combination of fields for movies with the title ``The
      Italian`` in the ``Drama`` genre. The ``plot`` field in the
      ``defaultPath`` will be searched only if no matching results can
      be found in either of the fields specified in the ``query``
      field. The ``query`` field contains escaped double quotes as
      delimiters for the phrase to search. 

      The query includes a :pipeline:`$project` stage to:

      - Exclude all fields except ``_id``, ``title``, ``plot``, and
        ``genres``
      - Add a field named ``score``

      The documents in the results match because:

      - In the first document, the ``plot`` field, which is the field to
        search per the  ``query``, contains both ``captain`` and ``kirk``,
        although only either one is required to meet the criteria for a
        match. For the term ``enterprise``, |fts| searches the
        ``fullplot`` field, which is the ``defaultPath``, because the
        ``plot`` field does not contain ``enterprise``, and finds
        ``enterprise`` in the ``fullplot`` field.
      - In the second document, the ``plot`` field contains all three
        search terms.
      - In the third document, the ``plot`` field contains ``kirk`` and
        ``enterprise``.

Advanced Examples
`````````````````

The examples in this section use the ``queryString`` operator to query
for movie plots that contain the terms ``captain``, ``kirk``, and
``chess``. This examples shows how different grouping of the same search
terms using parentheses can result in different documents to be
included in the search results.

The queries also includes a :pipeline:`$project` stage to:

- Exclude all fields except ``title``, ``plot``, and ``fullpath``
- Add a field named ``score``

      The document in the results is a match because the 
      ``plot`` contains the terms ``captain`` and ``kirk``, although
      only one is needed to meet the criteria for a match, and the
      term ``chess``, although not in the ``plot``, appears in the
      ``fullplot``, which is the ``defaultPath``.

      The documents in the results match because the ``plot``
      field contains the term ``captain``. The first document
      gets a higher score because |fts| also finds the terms ``kirk``
      and ``chess`` in the ``fullplot`` field although the terms are
      not required to be present to meet the criteria for a match.

Range Queries 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: TO 
      :tabid: to

      The following example uses the ``queryString`` operator to query the
      movie titles a range of textual values from the characters
      ``count`` to any character (defined using the wildcard character
      ``*``) in ascending alphabetical order. 

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true 
  
         .. input:: 
            :language: json
            :linenos: 

            db.movies.aggregate([
              {
                "$search": {
                  "queryString": {
                      "defaultPath": "plot",
                      "query": "title:[count TO *]"
                  }
                }
              },
              {
                "$limit": 10
              },
              {
                "$project": {
                  "_id": 0,
                  "title": 1
                }
              }
            ])
        
         .. output:: 
            :language: json
            :linenos: 

            [
              { title: 'Blacksmith Scene' },
              { title: 'The Great Train Robbery' },
              { title: 'The Land Beyond the Sunset' },
              { title: 'A Corner in Wheat' },
              { title: 'Winsor McCay, the Famous Cartoonist of the N.Y. Herald and His Moving Comics' },
              { title: 'Traffic in Souls' },
              { title: 'Gertie the Dinosaur' },
              { title: 'In the Land of the Head Hunters' },
              { title: 'The Perils of Pauline' },
              { title: 'The Birth of a Nation' }
            ]      

      |fts| results include movies with titles ``Blacksmith Scene``
      and ``A Corner in Wheat`` although the range in the query
      starts from characters ``count``. When you index with
      the default analyzer, ``lucene.standard``, |fts| creates
      separate tokens for the terms in the ``title`` field and
      matches the query term to the individual tokens. Specifically,
      |fts| creates the following tokens, at least one of which
      (indicated by √) matches the query criteria: 

      .. list-table:: 
         :widths: 30 70
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Title 
           - Standard Analyzer Tokens 

         * - Blacksmith Scene
           - ``blacksmith``, ``scene`` √
      
         * - A Corner in Wheat
           - ``a``, ``corner``, ``in``, ``wheat`` √
         
      If you index using the ``lucene.keyword`` analyzer, |fts|
      would create a single token for the whole string in the
      ``title`` field, resulting in results similar to the following 
      for the same query: 

      .. code-block:: json 
         :copyable: false 

         [
           { title: 'è Nous la Libertè' },
           { title: 'tom thumb' },
           { title: 'è nos amours' },
           { title: 'èke och hans vèrld' },
           { title: 'èdipussi' },

           { title: 'èxtasis' },
           { title: 'eXistenZ' }
         ]

   .. tab:: TO AND
      :tabid: to-and

      The following example uses the ``queryString`` operator to query the
      movie genres for ``drama`` and the titles for a range of textual
      values between ``man`` and ``men``, including both, in ascending
      alphabetical order. 

      .. io-code-block::

                }
              },
              {

              }
            ])
        
         .. output:: 
            :language: json
            :linenos:

            [
              { genres: [ 'Drama' ], title: 'The Wedding March' },
              { genres: [ 'Drama' ], title: 'Maria Chapdelaine' },
              { genres: [ 'Drama' ], title: 'Of Mice and Men' },

              { genres: [ 'Drama' ], title: 'A Matter of Dignity' },
              { genres: [ 'Drama' ], title: 'The Last Angry Man' }
            ]

      The documents in the results match because the ``genres`` field
      contains the term ``drama`` and the movie ``title`` field
      contains terms between ``Man`` and ``Men`` in alphabetical order
      (``Man``, ``Maque``, ``March``, ``Maria``, ``Matter``,
      ``Member``, and ``Men`` in the results). 

Wildcard Queries 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following examples use the ``queryString`` operator to query for
movie titles using fuzzy, wildcard, and regular expressions. The queries
include a :pipeline:`$project` stage to exclude all fields except
``title``. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Fuzzy Example 
      :tabid: fuzzy

      The following query uses fuzzy (``~``) to do a fuzzy search in
      the ``title`` field for movie titles that contain terms similar to 
      ``catch`` with up to a two character variation. 

      .. io-code-block::

              { title: 'Night Watch' }
            ]

   .. tab:: Wildcard Example 
      :tabid: wildcard 

      The following query uses wildcard expression to search the
      ``title`` field for movie titles that contain characters
      ``cou*t?*``, where ``*`` indicates any additional number of
      characters and ``?`` indicates any single character. 

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

                    "query": "cou*t?*" 
                  }
                }
              },
              {
                "$limit": 5
              },
              {
                "$project": {
                  "_id": 0,
                  "title": 1
                }
              }
            ])

         .. output::

              { title: 'The Country Girl' },
              { title: 'Raintree County' }
            ]

      The documents in the results match because the ``title``
      field contains the term ``Country`` or ``County``, which matches
      the query criteria for characters starting with ``cou`` followed
      by any number of characters (``n`` in the results) and then ``t`` 
      followed by at least one or many characters (``r`` as in
      ``country`` or ``y`` as in ``county`` in the results). 

   .. tab:: Regular Expression Example 
      :tabid: regex

      The following query uses a regular expression to search the
      ``title`` field for movie titles that contain characters that
      start with any character followed by the characters ``tal`` 
      and either ``y`` or ``ian`` after ``tal``. 

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true
      
         .. input:: 
            :language: json

                    "defaultPath": "title",
                    "query": "/.tal(y|ian)/" 
                  }
                }
              },
              {
                "$limit": 5
              },
              {

                  "_id": 0,
                  "title": 1
                }
              }
            ])
      
         .. output::

            :linenos: 

            [
              { title: 'The Italian' },
              { title: 'Journey to Italy' },
              { title: 'Divorce Italian Style' },
              { title: 'Marriage Italian Style' },
              { title: 'Jealousy, Italian Style' }
            ]

      The documents in the results match because the ``title``
      field contains the term ``Italy`` or ``Italian``, which matches
      the query criteria for any character (``I`` in the results)
      followed by ``tal`` with either ``y`` (as in ``Italy`` in the
      results) or ``ian`` (as in ``Italian`` in the results).  

Metadata Query 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following query searches the ``title`` field in the ``movies``
collection for ``Marvel``, ``Avengers``, ``Iron Man``, or ``Captain
America``. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: $searchMeta stage
      :tabid: searchmeta-stage 

      The following query returns movies in the following buckets
      (years) that match the search criteria:
