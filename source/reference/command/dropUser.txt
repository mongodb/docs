Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: dropUser

   Removes the user from the database where you run the command. If the
   user is on a different database than the current one, you must first
   switch to that database. To use :dbcommand:`dropUser` you must have
   the :authaction:`dropUser` action on the database.

   The :dbcommand:`dropUser` command uses the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        dropUser: "<user>",
        writeConcern: { <write concern> }
      }

   The command has the following fields:

   .. include:: /reference/command/dropUser-field.rst

Example
-------

The following sequence of commands in the :program:`mongo` shell removes
``Carlos`` from the ``products`` database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use products
   db.runCommand( { dropUser: "Carlos", writeConcern: { w: "majority" } } )
