Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to update
documents in a MongoDB collection by using the ``update_one`` and
``update_many`` methods.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your {+language+} application, create a ``Mongo::Client`` object that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following values to your ``database`` and ``collection`` variables:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/update.rb
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-db-coll
   :end-before: end-db-coll

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Update Operations
-----------------

You can update documents in MongoDB by using the following methods:

- ``update_one``: Updates *the first document* that matches the search criteria
- ``update_many``: Updates *all documents* that match the search criteria

Each update method requires the following parameters:

- **Query filter**, which matches the documents you want to update. To learn
  more about query filters, see the :ref:`ruby-specify-query`
  guide.

- **Update document**, which specifies the update operator and the fields and values to be
  updated. The update operator specifies the type of update to perform. To view a list of
  update operators and learn about their usages, see the
  :manual:`Field Update Operators guide page</reference/operator/update-field/>` in the
  {+mdb-server+} manual.

Update One Document Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``update_one`` method to find the first document
where the value of the ``name`` field is ``"Happy Garden"``. It then uses the ``$set``
operator to update the ``name`` field value to ``"Mountain House"``.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/write/update.rb
      :start-after: start-update-one
      :end-before: end-update-one
      :language: ruby
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      1 document(s) updated

Update Many Documents Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``update_many`` method to update all documents
where the value of the ``name`` field is ``"Starbucks"``. The update document uses the
``$rename`` operator to change the name of the ``address`` field to ``location``.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/write/update.rb
      :start-after: start-update-many
      :end-before: end-update-many
      :language: ruby
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      11 document(s) updated

Customize the Update Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``update_one`` and ``update_many`` methods accept options to configure the update
operation. You can pass these options individually as parameters, or you can create a
``Hash`` object that contains the options and pass the object as a parameter.
If you don't specify any options, the driver performs the update
operation with default settings.

The following table describes the options that you can use to
configure the update operation:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Description

   * - ``upsert``
     - | Whether the update operation performs an upsert operation if no 
         documents match the query filter. For more information, see the :manual:`upsert
         statement </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-command-upsert>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``bypass_document_validation``
     - | Whether the update operation bypasses document validation. This lets you 
         update documents that don't meet the schema validation requirements, if any 
         exist. For more information about schema validation, see :manual:`Schema
         Validation </core/schema-validation/#schema-validation>` in the MongoDB
         Server manual.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``collation``
     - | Language collation to use when sorting
         results. For more information, see :manual:`Collation </reference/collation/#std-label-collation>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``array_filters``
     - | List of filters that you specify to select which
         array elements the update applies to.

   * - ``hint``
     - | Index to use when matching documents. 
         For more information, see the :manual:`hint statement </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-command-hint>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``let``
     - | Map of parameter names and values to set top-level
         variables for the operation. Values must be constant or closed
         expressions that don't reference document fields. For more information,
         see the :manual:`let statement
         </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-let-syntax>` in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.

Modify Update Example
`````````````````````

The example uses the ``$equal`` operator to match documents
where the value of the ``name`` field is ``"Sunrise Pizzeria"``. It then uses the ``$set`` 
operator to set the ``borough`` field value in the first matching document to
``"Queens"`` and the ``cuisine`` field value to ``"Italian"``.

Because the ``upsert`` option is set to ``true``, if the query filter
doesn't match any existing documents, the driver inserts a new document that
contains the fields and values in the filter and update documents.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/write/update.rb
      :start-after: start-update-options
      :end-before: end-update-options
      :language: ruby
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      1 document(s) updated

Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``update_one`` and ``update_many`` methods each return a ``Result`` 
object. You can access the following methods from a ``Result`` instance:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``matched_count``
     - | Number of documents that matched the query filter, regardless of
         how many updates were performed.

   * - ``modified_count``
     - | Number of documents modified by the update operation. If an updated
         document is identical to the original, it is not included in this
         count.
         
   * - ``acknowledged?``
     - | Returns ``true`` if the server acknowledged the result.

   * - ``upserted_count``
     - | Returns the number of documents that were upserted in the database, if the driver
         performed an upsert.

   * - ``upserted_ids``
     - | Returns the ``_id`` value of the document that was upserted
         in the database, if the driver performed an upsert.

.. tip::

   Check the value of the ``acknowledged?`` method before you try
   to call any other ``Result`` methods. If the ``acknowledged?``
   method returns ``false``, the driver throws an ``InvalidOperation``
   exception if you try to call any other method on the ``Result`` object.
   The driver cannot determine these values if the server does not acknowledge the write
   operation.
