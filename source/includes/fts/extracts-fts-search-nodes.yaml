  You can deploy Search Nodes for dedicated (``M10`` or higher)
  {+clusters+} only. You can't add Search Nodes on free (``M0``) and
  shared (``M2`` and ``M5``) tier {+clusters+}. You can use the
  {+atlas-ui+} and the {+atlas-admin-api+} to provision Search Nodes for
  new and existing {+clusters+} on |aws|, |gcp|, or |azure|.

  You can host the Search Nodes on any cloud provider. 
  You can't deploy Search Nodes separately
  for :ref:`global clusters <global-clusters>`.

ref: fts-search-nodes-cloud-provider-regions
content: |
  |service| deploys the Search Nodes in the same |aws|, |gcp|, or |azure|
  regions as your electable, read-only, and analytics nodes.
  
  |service| supports deploying Search Nodes separately for workload
  isolation in only specific |aws|, |gcp|, and |azure| regions. The
  following {+atlas-ui+} behavior applies: 
  
  - If you select any of the following |aws| or |azure| regions for your
    {+cluster+} nodes first, |service| disables the :guilabel:`Search
    nodes for workload isolation` toggle.
  - If you enable :guilabel:`Search nodes for workload isolation`
    first, |service| disables the following in the dropdown for regions
    under :guilabel:`Electable nodes for high availability`.

  |service| doesn't support the following |aws|, |gcp|, and |azure|
  regions for search nodes.

ref: fts-search-nodes-search-tier
content: |
  You can select a search tier for your Search Nodes in the
  :guilabel:`Search Tier` tab. 
  
  By default, |service| deploys Search Nodes on
  ``S20``. You can select a higher tier for faster queries and more
  complex aggregations, or a lower tier for smaller workloads. If you 
  want to downsize to a lower tier, the search tier must accommodate 
  any existing search indexes, along with additional disk space for 
  bumper files and logs. For some tiers, you can also choose between 
  low-CPU, which is recommended for {+avs+}, and high-CPU, which is 
  optimized for |fts|.
  
  For Search Nodes deployed on |aws|, |service| provides different search 
  tiers in different regions. If the search tier that you selected is not 
  available for your region, |service| automatically deploys the search 
  nodes in the next higher tier that is available in that region.
  To learn more, see :ref:`AWS Search Tiers <amazon-aws-search-tiers>`. 
  
  To learn more about search tiers for Search Nodes deployed on |gcp| 
  or |azure|, see:
  
  - :ref:`GCP Search Tiers <google-gcp-search-tiers>`
  - :ref:`Azure Search Tiers <microsoft-azure-search-tiers>`

ref: fts-migrate-delete-search-nodes
content: |
  If you delete all existing Search Nodes on your {+cluster+}, there will
  be an interruption in processing your search query results while
  |service| migrates from ``mongot`` processes running separately on
  dedicated Search Nodes to ``mongot`` processes running alongside
  ``mongod``. You can't run queries while indexes are building on the
  node that hosts both the ``mongot`` and ``mongod`` processes, and you
  will experience query downtime.

---
ref: fts-migrate-add-search-nodes
content: |
  When you add Search Nodes to a {+cluster+} that doesn't have any search
  nodes, the existing ``mongot`` processes running alongside ``mongod``
  tail writes to the database that happen after |fts| completed the
  initial sync and the ``mongot`` processes on the new dedicated search
  nodes perform an initial sync on the required collections. This
  results in dual reads during the migration process.

ref: fts-search-nodes-encryption

  You can enable Encryption at Rest with Customer Key Management
  for all data on Search Nodes to secure your |search-type| workloads 
  with customer-managed encryption keys. To learn more, see 
  :ref:`enable-search-node-encryption`.

  This feature is currently available for |aws| |kms| only.
