Realm provides :ref:`many authentication providers <authentication-providers>` 
to log users into your app. Each provider creates a unique user identity. 
Realm lets you merge multiple credentials into one user identity.

Example
-------

Consider an application that offers :ref:`anonymous login 
<anonymous-authentication>`. This allows users to explore the app without 
registering. If users like the application, they create permanent 
accounts. They sign up with SSO or email/password authentication. By default, 
this creates a new ``User`` object. The app must link the new 
identity with the original User.

You can link identities using the 
:dotnet-sdk:`LinkCredentialsAsync() <reference/Realms.Sync.User.html#Realms_Sync_User_LinkCredentialsAsync_Realms_Sync_Credentials_>`. 
This links authentication providers to a logged-in 
:dotnet-sdk:`User <reference/Realms.Sync.User.html>` object.

In the example above, we must first register the new :ref:`email/password
<email-password-authentication>` user before linking. If you are using any of
the other :ref:`Auth Providers <authentication-providers>`, this step is
unnecessary. The following example uses :ref:`Google authentication
<google-authentication>` instead of EmailPassword:
