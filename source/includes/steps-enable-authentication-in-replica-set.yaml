title: Shut down all members of the replica set.
ref: shutdown-repset
level: 4
pre: |
  Shut down each :program:`mongod` in the replica set, starting with the 
  :term:`secondaries<secondary>`. Continue until *all* members of the 
  replica set are offline, including any :term:`arbiters<arbiter>`. 
  The :term:`primary` must be the *last* member shut down to avoid 
  potential rollbacks.

  To shut down a :program:`mongod`, connect each :program:`mongod` using a
  :program:`mongo` shell and issue the :method:`db.shutdownServer()` on the 
  ``admin`` database:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    use admin
    db.shutdownServer()
post: |
  At the end of this step, *all* members of the replica set should be offline.

ref: enable-auth

source:
  file: steps-deploy-replica-set-with-auth.yaml
  ref: deploy-repset-start-members
pre: |
  Running a :program:`mongod` with the ``keyFile`` parameter enforces both 
  :doc:`/core/security-internal-authentication` and 
  :doc:`/core/authorization`.

  Start *each* :program:`mongod` in the replica set using either 
  a configuration file or the command line.
  
  Use the original replica set name for ``replSetName`` when starting each 
  member. You cannot change the name of a replica set, and attempting to do 
  so results in errors.

  which grants access to replication operations.
