Connection Closed While in Data Explorer 
----------------------------------------

If you run into a ``Connection Closed - you appear to be offline`` error while 
in the :guilabel:`Data Explorer`, it means your browser detected that your 
local machine is offline.

After you restore your local network connectivity, reload the page and 
re-connect to your cluster.

Connection Failure with Error Code 1006
---------------------------------------

A ``[1006-0-0]`` error code refers to an irregular WebSocket closure. This means 
the browser's connection closed abruptly. This can occur when IT network policy 
restrictions block WebSocket connections.

If you run into a ``Connection Failure`` error with code ``[1006-0-0]``, ensure 
that your network configuration allows WebSocket connections to 
``*.mongodb.com`` or reach out to your network administrator for assistance.

Not Authorized to View Data Explorer 
------------------------------------

If the :guilabel:`Data Explorer` displays a :guilabel:`Not Authorized` message, 
ensure that you have the correct :ref:`project-level <manage-project-access>` or 
:ref:`organization-level <manage-org-access>` access requirements.
