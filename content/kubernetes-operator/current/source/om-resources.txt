Deploy Ops Manager Resources on Kubernetes Clusters
====================================================

.. meta::
   :description: Deploy and manage Ops Manager resources on Kubernetes clusters using the Kubernetes Operator, including secure deployment, backup configuration, and automated certificate renewal.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

:ref:`meko-om-arch`
  Review the |onprem| resource architecture.

:ref:`plan-om-resource`
  Review the |onprem| resource considerations and prerequisites.

:ref:`deploy-om-multi-cluster`
 Deploy the |onprem| instances and the {+appdb+} replica sets
 securely on multiple |k8s| clusters.

:ref:`deploy-om-container`
  Use the |k8s-op-short| to deploy the |onprem| resources securely on a
  single |k8s| cluster.

:ref:`deploy-om-container-remote-mode`
  Use the |k8s-op-short| to configure |onprem| to operate in **Remote** mode
  on a single |k8s| cluster.
  In Remote mode, the Backup Daemons and managed MongoDB resources download
  installation archives from HTTP endpoints on a web server or S3-compatible
  file store deployed to your |k8s| cluster instead of from the Internet.

:ref:`deploy-om-container-local-mode`
  Use the |k8s-op-short| to configure |onprem| to operate in **Local** mode
  on a single |k8s| cluster.
  In Local mode, the Backup Daemons and managed MongoDB resources download
  installation archives from a |k8s-pv| that you create for the |onprem|
  StatefulSet instead of from the Internet.

:ref:`meko-upgrade-om-version`
  Upgrade the versions of your |onprem| instance and :term:`backing databases`
  that the |k8s-op-short| uses to manage your deployment.

:ref:`configure-om-queryable-backups`
  Configure queryable backups for |onprem| deployments created with the |k8s-op-short|.

:ref:`configure-file-store`
  Configure backup snapshot storage for |onprem| resources created with the |k8s-op-short|.

:ref:`configure-kmip-backup-encryption`
  Configure |kmip| backup encryption.

:ref:`cert-manager-integration`
  Configure automated certificate renewal for |onprem| deployments with ``cert-manager``.

:ref:`disaster-recovery-om-appdb`
  Manually recover the |k8s-op-short|, the |application|, and the {+appdb+}
  in cases when the |k8s| cluster hosting the |k8s-op-short| fails, or when
  the {+appdb+}\'s replica set loses node majority to elect a primary.
