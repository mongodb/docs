If the |fcv| of your {+cluster+} is set and if the |fcv| is below the 
MongoDB version of your {+cluster+}, the {+cluster+} in the |service| 
UI :guilabel:`Database Deployments` page shows the |fcv-link| of your 
{+cluster+} to reflect the features that are currently available on 
your {+cluster+} during the upgrade. After |service| upgrades your 
{+cluster+} to the new version, the {+cluster+} in the |service| UI 
:guilabel:`Database Deployments` page shows the new MongoDB version of 
your {+cluster+}.
