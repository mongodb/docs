This page describes how {+csfle-abbrev+} uses metadata from your
{+dek-long+} and {+cmk-long+} to decrypt data.

.. _csfle-reference-decryption-metadata:

Metadata Used for Decryption
----------------------------

When you encrypt data using {+csfle-abbrev+}, the data you encrypt is
stored as a :bsontype:`BinData <Binary>` subtype 6 object that includes
the following metadata:

- The ``_id`` of the {+dek-long+} used to encrypt the data
- The encryption algorithm used to encrypt the data

{+dek-long+}s contain metadata that describes what {+cmk-long+} was used
to encrypt them.

Drivers and :binary:`~bin.mongosh` use this metadata to attempt
to automatically decrypt your data.

Automatic Decryption Process
----------------------------

To automatically decrypt your data, your {+csfle-abbrev+}-enabled client
performs the following procedure:

#. Check the ``BinData`` blob metadata of the field you intend to
   decrypt for the {+dek-long+} and encryption algorithm used to encrypt
   the value.

#. Check the {+key-vault-long+} configured in the current database
   connection for the specified {+dek-long+}. If the {+key-vault-long+}
   does not contain the specified key, automatic decryption fails and
   the driver returns the encrypted ``BinData`` blob.
   
#. Check the {+dek-long+} metadata for the {+cmk-long+}
   (CMK) used to encrypt the key material. 

#. Decrypt the {+dek-long+}. This process varies by KMS provider:

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: AWS
         :tabid: aws

         For the Amazon Web Services (AWS) KMS, send the {+dek-long+} to
         your AWS KMS instance for decryption. If the CMK does not exist
         *or* if the connection configuration does not grant access to
         the CMK, decryption fails and the driver returns the encrypted
         ``BinData`` blob.

            automatic encryption, see
            :ref:`csfle-tutorial-automatic-aws`.

      .. tab:: GCP
         :tabid: gcp

         For the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) KMS, send the {+dek-long+}
         to your GCP KMS instance for decryption. If the CMK does not
         exist *or* if the connection configuration does not grant
         access to the CMK, decryption fails and the driver returns the
         encrypted ``BinData`` blob.

            encryption, see :ref:`csfle-tutorial-automatic-gcp`.

      .. tab:: Azure
         :tabid: azure

         For the Azure Key Vault, send the {+dek-long+} to the your
         Azure Key Vault instance for decryption. If the CMK does not exist
         *or* if the connection configuration does not grant access to
         the CMK, decryption fails and the driver returns the
         encrypted ``BinData`` blob.

            encryption, see :ref:`csfle-tutorial-automatic-azure`.

      .. tab:: KMIP
         :tabid: kmip

         For a KMIP-compliant KMS, retrieve the CMK from the KMS and
         then use the CMK locally to decrypt the {+dek-long+}. If the
         CMK does not exist *or* if the connection configuration does
         not grant access to the CMK, decryption fails and the driver
         returns the encrypted ``BinData`` blob.

            encryption, see :ref:`csfle-tutorial-automatic-kmip`.

      .. tab:: Local Key Provider
         :tabid: local

         For a Local Key Provider, retrieve the CMK from your filesystem
         and use it to decrypt the {+dek-long+}. If the local key specified in
         the database configuration was not used to encrypt the
         {+dek-long+}, decryption fails and the driver returns the
         encrypted ``BinData`` blob.

         .. include:: /includes/csfle-warning-local-keys.rst

#. Decrypt the ``BinData`` value using the decrypted
   {+dek-long+} and appropriate algorithm.

Applications with access to the MongoDB server that do not *also* have
access to the required CMK and {+dek-long+}s cannot
decrypt the ``BinData`` values.

Automatically Encrypted Read Behavior
-------------------------------------

For read operations, the driver encrypts field values in the query
document using your encryption schema *prior* to issuing the read
operation.

Your client application then uses the ``BinData`` metadata to
automatically decrypt the document you receive from MongoDB.
