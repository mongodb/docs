   Profiling can negatively impact performance, and can introduce unencrypted query data into the system
   log. Carefully consider any performance and security implications
   before configuring and enabling the profiler on a production
   deployment.

   See :ref:`database-profiling-overhead` for more information on
   potential performance degradation.
