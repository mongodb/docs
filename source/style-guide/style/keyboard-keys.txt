Different keyboards use different names for common keys. For
consistency, use the following key names unless the technology that you
are documenting requires other forms:

-  Alt
-  arrow keys (generic)
-  Backspace
-  Command
-  Ctrl
-  Del
-  Down Arrow
-  End
-  Enter
-  Esc
-  Home
-  Ins
-  Left Arrow
-  Option
-  Page Down
-  Page Up
-  Right Arrow
-  Shift
-  Space
-  Tab
-  Up Arrow

When showing specific key names and key combinations, use the following
guidelines. For more information about formatting keyboard key
combinations, names, and shortcuts, see :ref:`text-formatting`.

   * - Guideline

     - Example

   * - When telling users to *type* a letter key (as in a command), use
       lowercase for the letter unless uppercase is required. Use
       *type* or *enter* when the action results in output on the
       interface.

     - When prompted, type ``y`` and then press :kbd:`Enter`.

       To change from command mode to insert mode, type ``i``.

   * - When telling users to press a letter key (as in a key
       combination), capitalize the letter. Use *press* when the action
       doesn't result in output on the interface.

       .. note::
          Don't use the verbs *hit*, *strike*, or *punch*.

       Separate the key names by :kbd:`-` or :kbd:`+`, depending on whether
       you're documenting Linux or Windows. If you're documenting for
       both, pick one symbol and use it consistently.

     - When you're finished, press :kbd:`Ctrl+X` to exit, type ``y`` to
       confirm your changes, and then press :kbd:`Enter` to save as the
       indicated file.

       Press :kbd:`F3` to find the next matching process, or press
       :kbd:`Esc` to quit the search.

       To move forward word by word, press :kbd:`W`. To move back word
       by word, press :kbd:`B`.

       To toggle between the progress bar screen and a Linux TTY
       screen, press :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-F2`.

   * - If part of a key combination requires the use of the :kbd:`Shift`
       key (such as typing an asterisk or an uppercase letter), add
       :kbd:`Shift` to the combination and then provide the name or
       symbol that results from pressing :kbd:`Shift` (such as
       \*\*\*\*\* or :kbd:`P`).

     - To jump to the end of the file, press :kbd:`Shift+G`.

       To apply the general number format, press :kbd:`Ctrl+Shift+~`.

   * - Avoid using *key* with specific key names.

       If needed for clarity, on the first use of a key name, you can
       use the definite article *the* and *key* with the name. On
       subsequent uses, refer to the key only by its name.

     - Press :kbd:`F3` to find the next matching process, or press
       :kbd:`Esc` to quit the search.

       Press the Help key (`F1`).
