.. _rust-version-2.8:

What's New in 2.8
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v2.8 release includes the following features,
improvements, and fixes:

- Adds the following MongoDB Atlas search index management helpers:

  - `create_search_index() <https://docs.rs/mongodb/2.8.0/mongodb/struct.Collection.html#method.create_search_index>`__
  - `create_search_indexes() <https://docs.rs/mongodb/2.8.0/mongodb/struct.Collection.html#method.create_search_indexes>`__
  - `update_search_index() <https://docs.rs/mongodb/2.8.0/mongodb/struct.Collection.html#method.update_search_index>`__
  - `drop_search_index() <https://docs.rs/mongodb/2.8.0/mongodb/struct.Collection.html#method.drop_search_index>`__
  - `list_search_indexes() <https://docs.rs/mongodb/2.8.0/mongodb/struct.Collection.html#method.list_search_indexes>`__

- Improves network connectivity and operation reliability.
  The driver avoids retrying network connections for ``mongos`` backends
  experiencing network connectivity issues. It also performs retries on a
  greater range of error types encountered.

`v2.8.0 Release Highlights
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver/releases/tag/v2.8.0>`__
on GitHub.

.. _rust-version-2.7:

What's New in 2.7
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v2.7 release includes the following features,
improvements, and fixes:

- Adds the ``human_readable_serialization`` option to the
  ``CollectionOptions`` struct. This option instructs the
  driver to serialize values passed to CRUD methods as a human-readable
  format. The default value of this option is ``false``.

  .. warning::

     If you set the value of ``human_readable_serialization`` to
     ``true``, your insert operations might run more slowly.

- Adds the ``run_cursor_command()`` method to run a database command and
  retrieve the response as a ``Cursor`` type. To learn more, see the
  :ref:`rust-run-command` guide.

- Adds SDAM event logging when you use the ``tracing-unstable`` feature
  flag.

- Adds the following configurations for ``Client`` and connection management:

  - ``max_connecting``: an option that you can set in a ``ClientOptions``
    struct to specify how many connections you can establish in
    parallel. To learn more about this option, see
    :ref:`rust-performance-pool` in the Performance Considerations
    guide.

  - ``Client::warm_connection_pool()``: a method that you can use to create
    new connections in the connection pool to provide more
    predictable performance. When you use this method, the driver
    attempts to create connections up to the number specified in the
    ``min_pool_size`` setting.

  - ``Client::shutdown()``: a method that you can use to stop background
    tasks and wait for handlers to drop. This method can be helpful if
    you use event handlers to reference external resources, as these
    handlers might be used in tasks even after the ``Client`` is
    closed.

`v2.7.0 Release Highlights

.. _rust-version-2.6:

What's New in 2.6
-----------------

The {+driver-short+} v2.6 release includes the following features,
improvements, and fixes:

- Supports AWS Identity and Access Management
  (IAM) roles for service accounts, such as Elastic Kubernetes
  Service (EKS) accounts.

- Supports GCP-attached service accounts when using the Cloud Key
  Management System (KMS).

- Supports fetching on-demand CSFLE credentials from the Azure KMS.

- Implements the ``FromStr`` trait for the ``Namespace`` struct.
  This change allows you to parse a string that includes a database and
  collection name, such as ``"testdb.testcollection"`` into a
  ``Namespace`` instance.

- Includes the ``server_id`` in a ``ConnectionInfo`` struct as an
  ``i64`` type.

- Removes most type constraints on values referenced by a ``Cursor``.

- Updates the ``libmongocrypt`` version in the driver dependencies in
  order to use the Queryable Encryption feature with equality queries.

`v2.6.0 Release Highlights
