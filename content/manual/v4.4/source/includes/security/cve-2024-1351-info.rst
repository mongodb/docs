.. important:: Fix for MongoDB Server may allow successful untrusted connection 

   Due to CVE-2024-1351, in |cve-version-list|, under certain
   configurations of :option:`--tlsCAFile <mongod --tlsCAFile>` and
   :setting:`~net.tls.CAFile`, MongoDB Server may skip peer certificate
   validation which may result in untrusted connections to succeed.
   
   This may effectively reduce the security guarantees provided by TLS
   and open connections that should have been closed due to failing
   certificate validation. This issue affects the following MongoDB
   Server versions:
   
   - 7.0.0 - 7.0.5
   - 6.0.0 - 6.0.13
   - 5.0.0 - 5.0.24
   - 4.4.0 - 4.4.28

   **CVSS Score**: 8.8 

   **CWE**: CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
