Enable Authentication after Creating the User Administrator
===========================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

This section describes how to enable authentication after creating the
user administrator. The approach requires a restart. To enable
authentication without restarting, see
:doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication`.

In this procedure, once you enable authentication, only the user
administrator can connect to the MongoDB instance. The user administrator
must log in and grant further access to the instance by creating
additional users.

Next Steps
----------

If you need to disable authentication for any reason, restart the process
without the :setting:`auth` or :setting:`keyFile` option.
