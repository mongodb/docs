Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: updateRole

   Updates the role on the database on which you run the command. An
   update to a field **completely replaces** the previous field's
   values.

   .. warning::

      When you update the ``privileges`` or ``roles`` arrays, you
      completely replace the previous array's values. To add roles
      without replacing the existing roles, use the
      :dbcommand:`grantRolesToRole` command.

   The :dbcommand:`updateRole` command uses the following syntax. To
   update a role, you must provide the ``privileges`` array, ``roles``
   array, or both:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { updateRole: "<role>",
        privileges: [
          { resource: { <resource> }, actions: [ "<action>", ... ] },
          ...
        ],
        roles: [
          { role: "<role>", db: "<database>" },
          ...
        ],
        writeConcern: <write concern document>

   The :dbcommand:`updateRole` command has the following fields:

   .. include:: /reference/command/updateRole-field.rst

   .. |local-cmd-name| replace:: :dbcommand:`updateRole`
   .. include:: /includes/fact-roles-array-contents.rst

Required Access
---------------

To run the :dbcommand:`updateRole` command, a user must have privileges
that include the :authaction:`revokeRole` action on all databases,
as well as:

- To update the ``roles`` array, a user must have privileges that
  include the :authaction:`grantRole` action on the database for
  every role in the updated array.

- To update the ``privileges`` array, a user must have
  :authaction:`grantRole` on the database for each privilege in the
  updated array. If the resource for the privilege is a collection in
  all databases, or all collections and all database, or the
  ``cluster`` resource, you must have :authaction:`grantRole` on
  the ``admin`` database.

Example
-------

The following is an example of the :dbcommand:`updateRole` command. While
the :data:`~admin.system.roles.privileges` and the
:data:`~admin.system.roles.roles` arrays are both optional, at least one of
the two is required:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { updateRole: "myClusterwideAdmin",
     privileges: [
       { resource: { db: "", collection: "" },
         actions: [ "find" , "update", "insert", "remove" ] }
     ],
     roles: [
       { role: "dbAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }
     ],
     writeConcern: { w: "majority" , wtimeout: 5000 }
   }
