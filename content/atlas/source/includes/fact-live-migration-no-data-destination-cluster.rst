- The destination |service| {+cluster+} must have no data. If the {+cluster+}
  has any data before you begin, you have the option to clear data on the
  destination {+cluster+} during the live migration process. Alternatively,
  you can manually delete the data on the destination {+cluster+} before
  starting the migration procedure.
