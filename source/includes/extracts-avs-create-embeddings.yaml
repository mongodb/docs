  In this section, you define a function to generate vector embeddings
  by using an embedding model. Select a tab based on whether you want to
  use an open-source embedding model or a proprietary model such as OpenAI. 

  .. note::

     Open-source embedding models are free to use and can be loaded
     locally from your application. Proprietary models 
     require an |api| key to access the models.

  to use an open-source embedding model or a proprietary model 
  from OpenAI. 
  
  This section also includes an optional function that
  you can use to compress your embeddings for efficient storage 
  and improved query performance. To learn more,

  Optionally, you can compress your embeddings by converting them 
  to |bson| binary format, also called ``binData`` vectors, 
  for efficient storage and retrieval. 
  To learn more, see :ref:`avs-vector-compression`. 

  This code does the following: 

  - Defines a function named ``generate_bson_vector`` to convert
    embeddings to ``binData`` vectors by using binary tools from the 
    :driver:`PyMongo driver </pymongo/>`.
  - Converts the embeddings you generated for the 
    string ``foo`` to ``binData`` vectors.

  a. Create a file named ``convert-embeddings.js``. 

     .. code-block:: shell

        touch convert-embeddings.js

  #. Paste the following code in the file. 

     This code defines a function named ``convertEmbeddingsToBSON`` to convert
     ``float32`` embeddings to ``binData`` vectors by using binary tools from the 
     :driver:`Node.js driver </node/>`.

     .. include:: /includes/avs-examples/create-embeddings/fact-bin-data-embedding-format-warning.rst

     .. literalinclude:: /includes/avs-examples/create-embeddings/convert-embeddings.js
        :language: js
        :copyable:
        :caption: convert-embeddings.js

  #. Save the file.
