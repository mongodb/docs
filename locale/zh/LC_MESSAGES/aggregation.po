"*map* stage that processes each document and *emits* one or more objects for"
" each input document, and *reduce* phase that combines the output of the map"
" operation. Optionally, map-reduce can have a *finalize* stage to make final"
" modifications to the result. Like other aggregation operations, map-reduce "
"can specify a query condition to select the input documents as well as sort "
"and limit the results."

"Map-reduce uses custom JavaScript functions to perform the map and reduce "

"aggregation pipeline."
