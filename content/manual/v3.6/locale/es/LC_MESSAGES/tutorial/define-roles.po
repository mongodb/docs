"Roles grant users access to MongoDB resources. By default, MongoDB provides "
"a number of :doc:`built-in roles </reference/built-in-roles>` that "
"administrators may use to control access to a MongoDB system. However, if "
"these roles cannot describe the desired privilege set of a particular user "
