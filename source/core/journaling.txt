Journaling Mechanics
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

When running with journaling, MongoDB stores and applies :doc:`write
operations </core/write-operations>` in memory and in the on-disk journal
before the changes are present in the data files on disk. This document discusses the
implementation and mechanics of journaling in MongoDB systems.  See
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-journaling`
for information on configuring, tuning, and managing journaling.

.. _journaling-journal-files:

Journal Files
-------------

With journaling enabled, MongoDB creates a journal subdirectory within
the directory defined by :setting:`dbpath`, which is :file:`/data/db`
by default. The journal directory holds journal files, which contain
write-ahead redo logs. The directory also holds a last-sequence-number
file. A clean shutdown removes all the files in the journal directory.
A dirty shutdown (crash) leaves files in the journal directory; these are
used to automatically recover the database to a consistent state when
the mongod process is restarted.

Journal files are append-only files and have file names prefixed with
``j._``. When a journal file holds 1 gigabyte of data, MongoDB creates
a new journal file. Once MongoDB applies all the write operations in a
particular journal file to the database data files, it deletes the file, as 
it is no longer needed for recovery purposes. Unless you
write *many* bytes of data per second, the journal directory should
contain only two or three journal files.

You can use the
:setting:`smallfiles` run time option when starting :program:`mongod` 
to limit the size of each journal file to 128 megabytes, if you prefer.

To speed the frequent sequential writes that occur to the current
journal file, you can ensure that the journal directory is on a
different filesystem from the database data files.

.. important::

   If you place the journal on a different filesystem from your data
   files you *cannot* use a filesystem snapshot alone to capture valid
   backups of a :setting:`dbpath` directory. In this case, use 
   :method:`~db.fsyncLock()` to ensure that database files are consistent
   before the snapshot and :method:`~db.fsyncUnlock()` once the snapshot
   is complete.

.. note::

   Depending on your filesystem, you might experience a preallocation
   lag the first time you start a :program:`mongod` instance with
   journaling enabled.

   MongoDB may preallocate journal files if the :program:`mongod`
   process determines that it is more efficient to preallocate journal
   files than create new journal files as needed. The amount of time
   required to pre-allocate lag might last several minutes, during
   which you will not be able to connect to the database. This is a
   one-time preallocation and does not occur with future invocations.

To avoid preallocation lag, see :ref:`journaling-avoid-preallocation-lag`.

.. _journaling-storage-views:

Storage Views used in Journaling
--------------------------------

Journaling adds three internal storage views to MongoDB.

The ``shared view`` stores modified data for upload to the MongoDB
data files. The ``shared view`` is the only view with direct access
to the MongoDB data files. When running with journaling, :program:`mongod`
asks the operating system to map your existing on-disk data files to the
``shared view`` virtual memory view. The operating system maps the files but
does not load them. MongoDB later loads data files into the ``shared view`` as
needed.

The ``private view`` stores data for use with :doc:`read operations
</core/read-operations>`.  The ``private view`` is the first place MongoDB applies new :doc:`write operations
</core/write-operations>`. Upon a journal commit, MongoDB copies the changes made 
in the ``private view`` to the ``shared view``, where they are then available for
uploading to the database data files.

The journal is an on-disk view that stores new write operations
after MongoDB applies the operation to the ``private view`` but
before applying them to the data files. The journal provides durability.
If the :program:`mongod` instance were to crash without having applied
the writes to the data files, the journal could replay the writes to
the ``shared view`` for eventual upload to the data files.

.. _journaling-record-write-operation:

How Journaling Records Write Operations
---------------------------------------

MongoDB copies the write operations to the journal in batches called
group commits. These "group commits" help
minimize the performance impact of journaling, since a group commit must
block all writers during the commit.  See :setting:`journalCommitInterval` for
information on the default commit interval.

Journaling stores raw operations that allow MongoDB to reconstruct the
following:

- document insertion/updates
- index modifications
- metadata changes to the namespace files
- creation and dropping of databases and their associated data files

As :doc:`write operations </core/write-operations>` occur, MongoDB
writes the data to the ``private view`` in RAM and then copies the write
operations in batches to the journal. The journal stores the operations
on disk to ensure durability.  Each journal entry describes the bytes the
write operation changed in the data files.

MongoDB next applies the journal's write operations to the ``shared
view``. At this point, the ``shared view`` becomes inconsistent with the
data files.

At default intervals of 60 seconds, MongoDB asks the operating system to
flush the ``shared view`` to disk. This brings the data files up-to-date
with the latest write operations.  The operating system may choose to
flush the ``shared view`` to disk at a higher frequency than 60 seconds,
particularly if the system is low on free memory.

When MongoDB flushes write operations to the data files, MongoDB notes which
journal writes have been flushed.  Once a journal file contains only flushed writes, 
it is no longer needed for recovery, and MongoDB either deletes it or recycles it for a new journal file.

As part of journaling, MongoDB routinely asks the operating system to
remap the ``shared view`` to the ``private view``, in order to save physical RAM.
Upon a new remapping, the operating system knows that physical memory pages can be
shared between the ``shared view`` and the ``private view`` mappings.

.. note::

   The interaction between the ``shared view`` and the on-disk
   data files is similar to how MongoDB works *without*
   journaling, which is that MongoDB asks the operating system to flush
   in-memory changes back to the data files every 60 seconds.
