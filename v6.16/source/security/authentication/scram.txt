Overview
--------

**Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM)** is a family of
authentication mechanisms that use a challenge-response mechanism to authenticate
the user. SCRAM-SHA-256, which uses the SHA-256 algorithm to hash your password, is the
default authentication mechanism in {+mdb-server+} version 4.0
and later. SCRAM-SHA-1, which uses the SHA-1 algorithm instead, is the default
authentication mechanism in {+mdb-server+} versions earlier than 4.0.

You can use SCRAM to authenticate to MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB
Enterprise Advanced, and MongoDB Community Edition.

.. tip:: SCRAM Mechanisms

   To learn more about the SCRAM family of authentication mechanisms, see
   `RFC 5802 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`__ and
   :wikipedia:`Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism <Salted_Challenge_Response_Authentication_Mechanism>`
   on Wikipedia.

   For more information about the MongoDB implementation of SCRAM, see
   :manual:`SCRAM </core/security-scram>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Code Placeholders 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code examples on this page use the following placeholders:

- ``<db_username>``: The MongoDB username of the user to authenticate.
- ``<db_password>``: The MongoDB password of the user to authenticate.
- ``<cluster_url>``: The network address of your MongoDB deployment.

To use the code examples, replace these placeholders with your own values.

Default Authentication Mechanism
--------------------------------

The ``DEFAULT`` authentication mechanism is a fallback setting that instructs
the driver to negotiate the first authentication mechanism supported by the
server in the following order of preference:

#. ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
#. ``SCRAM-SHA-1``
#. ``MONGODB-CR``

If the ``DEFAULT`` option is specified, the driver first attempts to
authenticate using ``SCRAM-SHA-256``. If the version of the MongoDB instance
does not support that mechanism, the driver attempts to authenticate using
``SCRAM-SHA-1``. If the instance does not support that mechanism either,
the driver attempts to authenticate using ``MONGODB-CR``.

You can specify the default authentication mechanism by setting the 
``authMechanism`` parameter to ``DEFAULT`` in the connection string, or by 
omitting the parameter since it is the default value. 

The following example shows how to set the authentication mechanism to the 
default by setting ``authMechanism`` to ``DEFAULT`` in the connection string:

.. important::
   Always **URI encode** the username and password using the
   ``encodeURIComponent`` method to ensure they are correctly parsed.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/authentication/default.js
   :language: javascript

To learn more about the SCRAM version that MongoDB supports,
see the :manual:`SCRAM </core/security-scram/>` section of the {+mdb-server+}
manual.

.. _node-scram-sha-256:

SCRAM-SHA-256
-------------

.. note::

   ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` is the default authentication method for MongoDB starting
   in version 4.0

``SCRAM-SHA-256`` is a SCRAM version that uses your username and password, 
encrypted with the ``SHA-256`` algorithm to authenticate your user.

You can specify this authentication mechanism by setting the ``authMechanism``
to the value ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` in the
:manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>` as shown in the
following sample code.

.. important::
   Always **URI encode** the username and password using the
   ``encodeURIComponent`` method to ensure they are correctly parsed.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/authentication/sha256.js
   :language: javascript

.. _node-scram-sha-1:

SCRAM-SHA-1
-----------

.. note::
   ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is the default authentication method for MongoDB versions
   3.0, 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6.

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is a SCRAM version that uses your
username and password, encrypted with the ``SHA-1`` algorithm to authenticate
your user.

You can specify this authentication mechanism by setting the ``authMechanism``
parameter to the value ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` in the
:manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>` as shown
in the following sample code.

.. important::
   Always **URI encode** the username and password using the
   ``encodeURIComponent`` method to ensure they are correctly parsed.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/authentication/sha1.js
   :language: javascript
