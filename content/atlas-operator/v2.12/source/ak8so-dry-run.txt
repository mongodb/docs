With the |ak8so| Dry Run feature, you can see what |ak8so| is going to change in 
|service|, with those custom resources applied to the K8S cluster. The |ak8so| 
emits events for every resource that it is going to create/update/delete in 
|service|. Events emitted by the |ak8so| running in Dry Run mode can be 
filtered by "Dry Run" reason. This feature is useful for :ref:`upgrading your Atlas Operator resources <upgrade-atlas-operator>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to use the |ak8so| Dry Run feature, you need to:

- Have access to a **new Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster**.
- Apply |ak8so| custom resources to your **new Kubernetes cluster**. 
  When you apply your resources, make sure you provide a `secret with credentials <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/operator/stable/ak8so-quick-start/#create-a-secret-with-your-api-keys-and-organization-id>`__.
  You need a new cluster, because upgrading CRDs on your existing |k8s| cluster 
  might leave |ak8so| unable to reconcile existing custom resources. Moreover, 
  the CRDs that are applied can be a newer version with potential breaking changes.

  .. note:: 

     Only one version of the AKO CRDs can exist in a specific |k8s| cluster. 
     This means that to test upgrading to a new version of the |ak8so|, you 
     need to deploy a new |k8s| cluster (possibly a temporary cluster) to 
     execute the dry run.

- Install CRDs to your cluster for the version of the |ak8so| you want to execute dry-run for.
- Create a ``mongodb-atlas-operator`` service account in your |k8s| cluster. 
- Create a `role <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-atlas-kubernetes/blob/main/releases/v2.12.0/deploy/openshift/openshift.yaml>`__
  and `rolebinding <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-atlas-kubernetes/blob/main/config/rbac/clusterwide/role_binding.yaml>`__ 
  for your `service account <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-atlas-kubernetes/blob/main/config/rbac/service_account.yaml>`__ 
  with the following permissions related to your |ak8so| custom resources. You 
  can either create these resources manually or with the :ref:`Atlas CLI <ak8so-quick-start-ref>`.
  
  - ``list``
  - ``get``
  - ``create``
  - ``update``
  - ``delete`` 

Dry Run Events
--------------

The Dry Run process emits either the following message types, each of which 
can be either of the type ``Normal`` or ``Warning``:

- ``Would [verb] ([HTTP-Method]) [Atlas resource URL]``
  
  - A description of a given |ak8so| resource and the |k8s| required |k8s| 
    process should the change be applied to your |service| environment. When in 
    Dry Run mode, |ak8so| only emits dry-run events for HTTP verbs 
    that would create/update/delete resources in |service|, such as 
    ``POST``, ``PATCH``, ``PUT``, ``DELETE``. 

- ``Done``

  - No further dry-run events will be reported.

- ``Finished``

  - The |k8s| Job running the dry-run process has completed.

Procedure
---------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: kubectl
      :tabid: kubectl-dry-run

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Apply the following |k8s| Job.

            Save the following example in a file called ``dry-run-job.yaml`` 
            and apply it to your cluster by running ``kubectl apply -f dry-run-job.yaml``. 
            This will start |ak8so| as a |k8s| Job with the ``--dry-run`` parameter. 
            Every reconciliation in the |ak8so| will run only once, emitting 
            events for each resource if there are changes between the resource 
            spec and its state in |service|.

            You can run this command multiple times without making any changes 
            to your |service| resources.

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/dry-run-example.yaml
               :linenos: 
               :copyable:
               :language: yaml

         .. step:: List the dry-run output.

            When the |k8s| Job is finished, you can list the events emitted 
            by running the following command:

            .. code-block:: bash

               kubectl -n mongodb-atlas-system get events --field-selector reason=DryRun

            This command will return output similar to the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

               LAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON   OBJECT                    MESSAGE
               103s        Normal    DryRun   atlasproject/my-project   Would delete (DELETE) /api/atlas/v1.0/groups/6558f184beba40022cbb2043/integrations/SLACK
               101s        Warning   DryRun   atlasproject/my-project   finished dry run

   .. tab:: Atlas CLI 
      :tabid: atlas-cli-dry-run

      .. procedure:: 
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Install the |ak8so| CRDs, RBAC and Service Account resources.

            .. code-block:: bash

               atlas kubernetes operator install --targetNamespace=mongodb-atlas-system --config-only

         .. step:: Run the following Atlas CLI command.

            Run the following |service| CLI command to start the dry run process. 
            You can run this command multiple times without making any changes 
            to your |service| resources.

            .. code-block:: bash

               atlas kubernetes dry-run --targetNamespace=mongodb-atlas-system --watch

            .. note:: 

               If the ``--watch`` flag is not provided, the |service| CLI exits  
               after completing the installation.

         .. step:: List the dry-run output.

            When the |k8s| Job is finished, you can list the events emitted 
            by running the following command:

            .. code-block:: bash

               kubectl -n mongodb-atlas-system get events --field-selector reason=DryRun

            This command will return output similar to the following:

            .. code-block:: bash

               LAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON   OBJECT                    MESSAGE
               103s        Normal    DryRun   atlasproject/my-project   Would delete (DELETE) /api/atlas/v1.0/groups/6558f184beba40022cbb2043/integrations/SLACK
               101s        Warning   DryRun   atlasproject/my-project   finished dry run


Log Resource Diffs
------------------

When ``--log-level`` is set to ``debug``, the |ak8so| provides a detailed diff of 
the changes that you make to |service| resources that are managed by the |ak8so|. 
This diff is particularly useful when used in conjunction with the Dry Run 
feature, as it allows you to see the differences between the current state of 
your |ak8so| custom resources and the state that the |ak8so| would apply to your 
|service| environment.

This diff feature is informed by comparing the result of any PUT or PATCH 
requests sent to |service| with the current state of the |ak8so| 
custom resources in your |service| environment. 

.. note:: 

   To facilitate this comparison, the |ak8so| makes a GET request to |service| to 
   learn the current state of resources in |service|. As such, we recommend 
   that you only set the log level to debug in non-production environments,
   as this feature can increase the load on |service|. 

To see the differences, you need to set the ``--log-level=debug`` flag when 
running the |ak8so| command. Because the |ak8so| uses structured 
logging, we recommend analyzing the JSON diff in a structured logging viewer 
for better human readability. The following example shows a rendered |ak8so| 
``DEBUG`` log line in YAML format, as displayed in a structured logging viewer:

.. io-code-block::
   
   .. input:: 
      :language: yaml

      apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
      kind: AtlasDeployment
      metadata:
        name: test
        namespace: flex

            regionName: US_EAST_1
          terminationProtectionEnabled: true -> false
        projectRef:
