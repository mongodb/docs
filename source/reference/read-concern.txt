The ``readConcern`` query option for replica sets and replica set
shards determines which data to return from a query. 

.. _read-concern-levels:

Read Concern Levels
-------------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.4

   Adds support for :readconcern:`"linearizable"` read concern.

The following read concern levels are available:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 90

   * - ``level``
     - Description

   * - .. readconcern:: "local"

     - Default. The query returns the instance's most recent data.
       Provides no guarantee that the data has been written to a
       majority of the replica set members (i.e. may be rolled back).

   * - .. readconcern:: "majority"

     - The query returns the instance's most recent data acknowledged
       as having been written to a majority of members in the replica
       set.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-enable-majority-readConcern.rst

   * - .. readconcern:: "linearizable"

     - The query returns data that reflects all successful writes
       issued with a write concern of :writeconcern:`"majority"` *and*
       acknowledged prior to the start of the read operation. For
       replica sets that run with
       :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` set to true,
       linearizable read concern returns data that will never be rolled
       back. 

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/no-journaling-rollback.rst

       You can specify linearizable read concern for read operations on
       the :replstate:`primary <PRIMARY>` only.

       Linearizable read concern guarantees only apply if read
       operations specify a query filter that uniquely identifies a
       single document.

       .. tip::

          Always use ``maxTimeMS`` with linearizable read concern in
          case a majority of data bearing members are unavailable.
          ``maxTimeMS`` ensures that the operation does not block
          indefinitely and instead ensures that the operation returns
          an error if the read concern cannot be fulfilled.

       Lineariable read concern is available for both MMAPv1 and
       WiredTiger. See :ref:`read-concern-storage-engine-drivers`.

Storage Engine and Drivers Support

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 30 20

     - |checkmark|

.. tip::

   The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns the
   :serverstatus:`storageEngine.supportsCommittedReads` field which
   indicates whether the storage engine supports ``"majority"`` read
   concern.

MongoDB drivers updated for 3.2 and later versions support specifying
a read concern option.

.. include:: /includes/unicode-checkmark.rst

``readConcern`` Option
----------------------

Use the ``readConcern`` option to specify the read concern level.

.. code-block:: javascript

   readConcern: { level: <"majority"|"local"|"linearizable"> }

The ``readConcern`` option is available for the following operations:

- :dbcommand:`find` command

- :dbcommand:`aggregate` command and the
  :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method

- :dbcommand:`distinct` command

- :dbcommand:`count` command

- :dbcommand:`parallelCollectionScan` command

- :dbcommand:`geoNear` command

- :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command

To specify the read concern for the :program:`mongo` shell method
:method:`db.collection.find()`, use the :method:`cursor.readConcern()`
method.

Considerations
--------------

Read Your Own Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-read-own-writes.rst

Real Time Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Combined with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern,
:readconcern:`"linearizable"` read concern enables multiple threads to
perform reads and writes on a single document as if a single thread
performed these operations in real time; that is, the corresponding
schedule for these reads and writes is considered linearizable.

Performance Comparisons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike :readconcern:`"majority"`, :readconcern:`"linearizable"` read
concern confirms with secondary members that the read operation is
reading from a primary that is capable of confirming writes with
:writeconcern:`{ w: "majority" } <"majority">` write concern.
[#edge-cases-2-primaries]_ As such, reads with linearizable read
concern may be significantly slower than reads with
:readconcern:`"majority"` or :readconcern:`"local"` read concerns.

Always use ``maxTimeMS`` with linearizable read concern in case a
majority of data bearing members are unavailable. ``maxTimeMS`` ensures
that the operation does not block indefinitely and instead ensures that
the operation returns an error if the read concern cannot be fulfilled.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.find( { _id: 5 } ).readConcern("linearizable").maxTimeMS(10000)

   db.runCommand( {
        find: "restaurants",
        filter: { _id: 5 },
        readConcern: { level: "linearizable" },
        maxTimeMS: 10000
   } )
