*Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*

The following steps in this tutorial show you how to insert and
interact with data on your cluster. Select the appropriate tab based
on how you would like to interact with your cluster data:

         Drivers allow you to interact with your databases programmatically
         using one of several available programming languages. For a complete
         list of MongoDB drivers, see the :driver:`driver documentation </>`.

                  Insert Data into your Atlas Cluster with the PyMongo Driver

                  In the :ref:`previous section <gswa-connect>` you used
                  the PyMongo driver to connect to your |service| cluster.
                  In this section you'll create a new collection, add data to
                  it, and read the new data.
         
                  .. include:: /includes/steps/gswa-driver-insert.rst
         
                  View Your Cluster Data
                  ----------------------
         
                  Now that you have successfully inserted a document into
                  your |service| cluster using the PyMongo driver, you can try
                  reading that data with the PyMongo ``find_one()`` method.
         
                  The following command returns one document from the 
                  ``people`` collection that has a ``name.last`` value 
                  of ``Turing``:

                  .. code-block:: python

                     people.find_one({ "name.last": "Turing" })

                  This command returns the following output. This example 
                  has been broken into multiple lines for readability.

                  .. code-block:: python
                     :copyable: false

                     { 
                       '_id': ObjectId('5ecd43aa2600f51da704b35f'), 
                       'name': { 
                         'first': 'Alan', 
                         'last': 'Turing' 
                       }, 
                       'birth': datetime.datetime(1912, 6, 23, 0, 0), 
                       'death': datetime.datetime(1954, 6, 7, 0, 0), 
                       'contribs': [
                         'Turing machine', 
                         'Turing test', 
                         'Turingery'
                       ], 
                       'views': 1250000 
                     }

                  .. note::
         
                     You may see a different value for
                     :manual:`ObjectId </reference/bson-types/#objectid>`,
                     because it is a system-generated value.

                  Summary
                  -------

                  Congratulations! You've used the PyMongo driver to interact
                  with data on your cluster.

                  Insert Data into your Atlas Cluster with the Node.js Driver
                  -----------------------------------------------------------

                  *Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*

                  In the :ref:`previous section <gswa-connect>` you used
                  the Node.js driver to connect to to your |service| cluster.
                  In this section you'll create a new collection, add data to
                  it, and read the new data.

                  The following sample application adds a document to a collection
                  called ``people`` in the ``test`` database. To try it out, copy
                  the following code into a file called ``insert-data.js``.

                  .. note::

                     Replace the placeholders on line 4 with your |service| connection
                     string.

                  .. literalinclude:: /includes/insert-data.js  
                     :language: javascript
                     :linenos:
                     :emphasize-lines: 4

                  To run the sample application, use the following command:
     
                  .. code-block:: shell
     
                     node insert-data.js

                  .. seealso::
         
                     For more information on querying data with Node.js, see
                     the :driver:`Node.js documentation </node/>`.

                  Summary
                  -------
                  
                  Congratulations! You've used the Node.js driver to interact
                  with data on your cluster.

     - id: shell
       name: Mongo Shell
       content: |

         Insert Data Into Your Cluster Using the Shell
         ---------------------------------------------

         *Estimated completion time: 1 minute* 

         Now that you have successfully connected to your |service|
         cluster using the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, let's insert a
         document into your cluster.

         .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-shell-insert.rst

         View Data Using the Shell
         -------------------------

         *Estimated completion time: 1 minute* 

         Now we can try reading the data we just inserted into our
         cluster.

         The following command searches our ``people`` collection for
         documents which have a ``name.last`` value of ``Turing``:

         .. code-block:: none

            db.people.find({ "name.last": "Turing" })

         When you run this command, you should see the following
         output:

         .. code-block:: none
            :copyable: false

            {
              "_id" : ObjectId("5c9bca3c5345268c98ac7abc"),
              "name" : {
                "first" : "Alan",
                "last" : "Turing"
              },
              "birth" : ISODate("1912-06-23T04:00:00Z"),
              "death" : ISODate("1954-06-07T04:00:00Z"),
              "contribs" : [
                "Turing machine",
                "Turing test",
                "Turingery"
              ],
              "views" : NumberLong(1250000)
            }

         .. note::

            You may see a different value for
            :manual:`ObjectId </reference/bson-types/#objectid>`,
            because it is a system-generated value.

         Summary
         -------
         
         Congratulations! You've just set up an |service| cluster to
         host your data, and used the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to
         write and read data to and from your cluster.

     - id: atlas-gui
       name: Atlas UI
       content: |

         Insert Data Using the Atlas UI
         ------------------------------

         |service| provides a :abbr:`GUI (Graphical user interface)`
         to interact with data in your cluster, called the
         :guilabel:`Data Explorer`. You can use the
         :guilabel:`Data Explorer` to import
         :ref:`sample data <sample-data>` provided by |service| into
         your cluster.

         To import sample data into your cluster using the
         :guilabel:`Data Explorer`:
         
         .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-explorer-import.rst

         .. seealso::

            For more information on Data Explorer in |service|, see
            :doc:`/data-explorer`.

         View and Edit Your Cluster Data
         -------------------------------

         *Estimated completion time: 2 minutes*

         Now that you have imported some data into your cluster, you
         can try viewing and modifying it.

         .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-explorer-edit.rst

         Summary
         -------

         Congratulations! You have just set up an |service| cluster to
         host your data, populated that cluster with sample data, and
         learned how to interact with that data using the |service|
         :guilabel:`Data Explorer`.

Moving Forward
