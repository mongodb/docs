====================================

The Swift SDK provides property wrappers to open a realm in a 
SwiftUI-friendly way. 

You can:

- :ref:`Implicitly open a realm <ios-open-realm-with-configuration-swiftui>` 
  with a ``defaultConfiguration`` or specify a different configuration. 
  This works for both non-synced and synced realms.
- :ref:`Always download changes before opening a synced realm 
  <swiftui-async-open-synced-realm>`, which times out when the user is offline.
- :ref:`Open a synced realm even when a user is offline 
  <swiftui-auto-open-synced-realm>`. The realm may lack the most recent data.

.. _ios-open-realm-with-configuration-swiftui:

Open a Realm with a Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you use :swift-sdk:`@ObservedRealmObject <Structs/ObservedRealmObject.html>` 
or :swift-sdk:`@ObservedResults <Structs/ObservedResults.html>`, these 
property wrappers implicitly open a realm and retrieve the specified 
objects or results.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/PassObjectsToView.snippet.implicitly-open-realm.swift
   :language: swift

.. include:: /includes/note-observedresults-swiftui-view.rst

When you do not specify a configuration, these property wrappers use the 
:swift-sdk:`defaultConfiguration <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13ConfigurationV07defaultC0AEvpZ>`. 
You can :ref:`set the defaultConfiguration <ios-default-and-file-url-realm>`
globally, and property wrappers across the app can use that configuration 
when they implicitly open a realm.

You can provide alternative configurations that the property wrappers use 
to implicitly open the realm. You might want to do this when using 
multiple configurations in your app, as in cases where you have both
a :swift-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Structs/SyncConfiguration.html>` and 
a local :swift-sdk:`Configuration <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>`.
To do this, :ref:`create explicit configurations <ios-configure-and-open-a-realm>`. 
Then, :ref:`use environment injection to pass the respective configurations 
to the views that need them <ios-swiftui-inject-realm-configuration>`.
Passing a configuration to a view where property wrappers open a realm 
uses the passed configuration instead of the ``defaultConfiguration``.

.. _ios-open-synced-realm-swiftui:

Open a Synced Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.12.0

These SwiftUI property wrappers open synced realms and populate views.
The main difference between these property wrappers is whether the user 
must be online:

- To download updates from your Atlas App Services app before opening a realm, use the 
  :ref:`@AsyncOpen <swiftui-async-open-synced-realm>` property wrapper. This 
  requires the user to have a network connection. 
- To open a synced realm regardless of whether the user has a network 
  connection, use the :ref:`@AutoOpen <swiftui-auto-open-synced-realm>` 
  property wrapper. This property wrapper enables developers to design 
  offline-first capabilities into their apps.

Download Changes Before Opening a Synced Realm
``````````````````````````````````````````````

Use the :swift-sdk:`@AsyncOpen <Structs/AsyncOpen.html>` property wrapper 
for apps that require up-to-date information from the server, such as game 
apps with live leaderboards that the user can play on multiple devices. This 
ensures the user is never using the app with stale data.

   .. tab:: Flexible Sync
      :tabid: flex-sync

      .. versionadded:: 10.27.0

      Realm Swift SDK version 10.27.0 adds :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>` 
      versions of the property wrappers to open Realm with SwiftUI. You can 
      add subscription queries in ``.onAppear`` after opening the realm.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/OpenRealm.snippet.fs-property-wrapper-sans-config-comment.swift
         :language: swift

      .. versionadded:: 10.28.0

      You can create a :swift-sdk:`flexibleSyncConfiguration() 
      <Extensions/User.html#/s:So7RLMUserC10RealmSwiftE25flexibleSyncConfigurationAC0B0V0F0VyF>` 
      with the ``initialSubscriptions`` parameter. You can use this parameter 
      to :ref:`subscribe to Flexible Sync queries 
      <ios-sync-subscribe-to-queryable-fields>` in the configuration. If 
      this runs more than once - for example, if it's in a view that 
      reloads regularly - check whether the subscription exists already
      before adding it. Adding the same subscription again throws an error.
      
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/Authenticate.snippet.flexible-sync-config.swift
         :language: swift

      Then, pass the configuration to the view that contains the property 
      wrappers as an environment object.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/Authenticate.snippet.inject-flex-sync-config-as-environment-object.swift
         :language: swift

      For a complete example, see the :ref:`SwiftUI Quick Start <swiftui-integrate-with-sync>`.

   .. tab:: Partition-Based Sync
      :tabid: pbs

      To open a realm with :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>`, 
      add a ``partitionValue`` to the property wrapper:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/OpenRealm.snippet.pbs-async-open-property-wrapper.swift
         :language: swift

This SwiftUI property wrapper initiates ``Realm.asyncOpen()`` for the current 
user. The property wrapper publishes states, represented by the :swift-sdk:`AsyncOpenState 
enum <Enums/AsyncOpenState.html#/s:10RealmSwift14AsyncOpenStateO5erroryACs5Error_pcACmF>`,
which you can use to update the view. 

.. example::

   This example illustrates one way you might use ``@AsyncOpen`` to 
   open a realm in a view. First, check for a user, or log them in.
   Then, attempt to open the realm, switching on the ``AsyncOpenState``
   to display an appropriate view. When the realm opens successfully,
   inject it as an environment value to populate the view.

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: Flexible Sync
         :tabid: flex-sync

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/OpenRealm.snippet.open-realm-view-flex-sync.swift
            :language: swift

      .. tab:: Partition-Based Sync
         :tabid: pbs

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/OpenRealm.snippet.async-open-synced-realm.swift
            :language: swift

.. _swiftui-auto-open-synced-realm:

Open a Synced Realm Offline
```````````````````````````

Like ``@AsyncOpen``, :swift-sdk:`@AutoOpen <Structs/AutoOpen.html>` attempts 
to download updates before opening the realm. However, if a network 
connection is not available, this method instead opens a realm with 
data on the device.

Use this property wrapper for apps where it's not a problem for the user 
to work with potentially stale data, such as note-taking apps where users 
should be able to work with data on the device

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Flexible Sync
      :tabid: flex-sync

      .. code-block:: swift

         @AutoOpen(appId: "app_id") var autoOpen

   .. tab:: Partition-Based Sync
      :tabid: pbs

      .. code-block:: swift

         @AutoOpen(appId: "app_id", partitionValue: <partition_value>) var autoOpen

This SwiftUI property wrapper attempts to download updates before opening a 
realm for the current user. If there is no internet connection, this property 
wrapper instead returns the most up-to-date version of the local realm file 
for the given ``appId`` and Flexible Sync or Partition-Based Sync 
configuration.

The property wrapper publishes states, represented by the :swift-sdk:`AsyncOpenState 
enum <Enums/AsyncOpenState.html#/s:10RealmSwift14AsyncOpenStateO5erroryACs5Error_pcACmF>`,
which you can use to update the view. For a full example, see the ``@AsyncOpen``
code examples above.
