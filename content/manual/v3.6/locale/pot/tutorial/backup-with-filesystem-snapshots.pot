#: ../source/tutorial/backup-with-filesystem-snapshots.txt:17
msgid "These filesystem snapshots, or \"block-level\" backup methods, use system level tools to create copies of the device that holds MongoDB's data files. These methods complete quickly and work reliably, but require additional system configuration outside of MongoDB."

msgid "Snapshots Overview"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/tutorial/backup-with-filesystem-snapshots.txt:41
msgid "Snapshots work by creating pointers between the live data and a special snapshot volume. These pointers are theoretically equivalent to \"hard links.\" As the working data diverges from the snapshot, the snapshot process uses a copy-on-write strategy. As a result, the snapshot only stores modified data."

#: ../source/tutorial/backup-with-filesystem-snapshots.txt:64
msgid "For the :doc:`MMAPv1 storage engine </core/mmapv1>`, if writes are *in progress* when the backup occurs, the data files will reflect an inconsistent state. With :ref:`journaling <journaling-mmapv1>`, all data file states resulting from in-progress writes are recoverable; without journaling, you must flush all pending writes to disk before running the back up operation and must ensure that no writes occur during the entire back up procedure. If you do use journaling, the journal **must** reside on the same volume as the data."
