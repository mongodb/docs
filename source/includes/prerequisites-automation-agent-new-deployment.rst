Installing to a Server Before Installing MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you deploy the Automation Agents to a server that does not have MongoDB
installed, you must ensure that the user that owns the Automation Agent
has ``Read`` / ``Write`` access to the MongoDB data directory and log file
path you plan to use.
