  With WiredTiger, {{operation}} *cannot* guarantee a consistent set of
  files for low-level backups (e.g. via file copy ``cp``, ``scp``,
  ``tar``).

   .. note::

      The {{cachesetting}} only limits the size of the WiredTiger
      cache, not the total amount of memory used by :binary:`~bin.mongod`.
      The WiredTiger cache is only one component of the RAM used by
      MongoDB. MongoDB also automatically uses all free memory on the
      machine via the filesystem cache (data in the filesystem cache is
      compressed).

      In addition, the operating system will use any free RAM to buffer
      filesystem blocks.

      To accommodate the additional consumers of RAM, you may have to
      decrease WiredTiger cache size. Avoid increasing the WiredTiger
      cache size above its default value.

   The default WiredTiger cache size value assumes that there is a
   single :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance per node. If a single node
   contains multiple instances, then you should decrease the setting to
   accommodate the other :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instances.

   If you run :binary:`~bin.mongod` in a container (e.g. ``lxc``,
   ``cgroups``, Docker, etc.) that does *not* have access to all of the
   RAM available in a system, you must set {{cachesetting}} to a value less
   than the amount of RAM available in the container. The exact amount
   depends on the other processes running in the container.
