               To configure your application, create a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file in
               your project directory. Then, add the following code to the file:

               .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/tutorials/synonyms/initialize-cmake-c-equivalent.rst
                  :caption: CMakeLists.txt

                  :linenos:
                  :copyable:

               The preceding code performs the following actions:

               - Configures a C project.
               - Creates a ``query.out`` executable for your application.
               - Finds and requires the C driver. Replace the ``<version>``
                 placeholder with your C driver version synonyms, such as ``2.0.0``.
               - Links the program to the ``libmongoc`` library.

               .. note::

                  In the sample ``CMakeLists.txt`` file, the ``mongoc::mongoc`` target
                  points to either the static library or the shared library.
                  The library type depends on which one is available and
                  whichever type the user specifies in the ``MONGOC_DEFAULT_IMPORTED_LIBRARY_TYPE``
                  CMake configuration setting. If you don't set this value and
                  both library types are available, ``mongoc::mongoc`` uses
                  the static library.

                  You can use the ``mongoc::static`` target to explicitly use the 
                  static library or the ``mongoc::shared`` target to use the shared
                  library.

               .. note::

                  In the sample ``CMakeLists.txt`` file, the ``mongoc::mongoc`` target
                  points to either the static library or the shared library.
                  The library type depends on which one is available and
                  whichever type the user specifies in the ``MONGOC_DEFAULT_IMPORTED_LIBRARY_TYPE``
                  CMake configuration setting. If you don't set this value and
                  both library types are available, ``mongoc::mongoc`` uses
                  the static library.

                  You can use the ``mongoc::static`` target to explicitly use the 
                  static library or the ``mongoc::shared`` target to use the shared
                  library.
