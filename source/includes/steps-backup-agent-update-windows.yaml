      If you receive a message that your Backup Agent is out of date, make
      sure you are running an upgradeable version of the Backup Agent. If
      you are running the version of the Backup Agent named
      ``MongoDBBackup``, you must remove it before upgrading. To
      check if you are running ``MongoDBBackup``, issue the following
      command in an Administrative command prompt:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sc query MongoDBBackup
  - pre: |
      If the command returns a result, you must remove the ``MongoDBBackup``
      agent. To remove it, issue the following:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sc delete MongoDBBackup
