.. dbcommand:: isMaster

   :dbcommand:`isMaster` returns a document that describes the role of
   the :program:`mongod` instance.

   If the instance is a member of a
   replica set, then :dbcommand:`isMaster` returns a subset of the
   replica set configuration and status including whether or not the
   instance is the :term:`primary` of the replica set.

   When sent to a :program:`mongod` instance that is not a member of a
   replica set, :dbcommand:`isMaster` returns a subset of this
   information.

   MongoDB :term:`drivers <driver>` and :term:`clients <client>` use
   :dbcommand:`isMaster` to determine the state of the replica set
   members and to discover additional members of a :term:`replica
   set`.

   The :method:`db.isMaster()` method in the :program:`mongo` shell
   provides a wrapper around :dbcommand:`isMaster`.

   The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { isMaster: 1 }

   The command can take also take the following options:

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/sessions-option-table-options.rst

.. seealso::

   :method:`db.isMaster()`

Output
------

All Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following :dbcommand:`isMaster` fields are common across all
roles:

.. data:: isMaster.ismaster

   A boolean value that reports when this node is writable. If
   ``true``, then this instance is a :term:`primary` in a
   :term:`replica set`, or a :term:`master` in a master-slave
   configuration, or a :program:`mongos` instance, or a standalone
   :program:`mongod`.

   This field will be ``false`` if the instance is a
   :term:`secondary` member of a replica set or if the member is an
   :term:`arbiter` of a replica set.

.. data:: isMaster.maxBsonObjectSize

   The maximum permitted size of a :term:`BSON` object in bytes for
   this :program:`mongod` process. If not provided, clients should
   assume a max size of "``16 * 1024 * 1024``".

.. data:: isMaster.maxMessageSizeBytes

   .. versionadded:: 2.4

   The maximum permitted size of a :term:`BSON` wire protocol message.
   The default value is ``48000000`` bytes.

.. data:: isMaster.maxWriteBatchSize

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   The maximum number of write operations permitted in a write batch.
   If a batch exceeds this
   :limit:`limit<Write Command Batch Limit Size>`, the client
   driver divides the batch into smaller groups each with counts less
   than or equal to the value of this field.

   The value of this limit is ``100,000`` writes.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6

      The limit raises from ``1,000`` to ``100,000`` writes. This limit
      also applies to legacy ``OP_INSERT`` messages.

.. data:: isMaster.localTime

   Returns the local server time in UTC. This value is an
   :term:`ISO date <ISODate>`.

.. data:: isMaster.minWireVersion

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   The earliest version of the wire protocol that this
   :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance is capable of using
   to communicate with clients.

   Clients may use :data:`~isMaster.minWireVersion` to help negotiate
   compatibility with MongoDB.

.. data:: isMaster.maxWireVersion

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   The latest version of the wire protocol that this :program:`mongod`
   or :program:`mongos` instance is capable of using to communicate
   with clients.

   Clients may use :data:`~isMaster.maxWireVersion` to help negotiate
   compatibility with MongoDB.

Sharded Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:program:`mongos` instances add the following field to the
:dbcommand:`isMaster` response document:

.. data:: isMaster.msg

   Contains the value ``isdbgrid`` when :dbcommand:`isMaster`
   returns from a :program:`mongos` instance.

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`isMaster` contains these fields when returned by a member
of a replica set:

.. data:: isMaster.setName

   The name of the current :replica set.

.. data:: isMaster.setVersion

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   The current replica set config version.

.. data:: isMaster.secondary

   A boolean value that, when ``true``, indicates if the
   :program:`mongod` is a :term:`secondary` member of a :term:`replica
   set`.

.. data:: isMaster.hosts

   An array of strings in the format of ``"[hostname]:[port]"`` that
   lists all members of the :term:`replica set` that are neither
   :term:`hidden <hidden member>`, :term:`passive <passive member>`,
   nor :term:`arbiters <arbiter>`.

   Drivers use this array and the :data:`isMaster.passives` to determine
   which members to read from.

.. data:: isMaster.passives

   An array of strings in the format of ``"[hostname]:[port]"``
   listing all members of the :term:`replica set` which have a
   :rsconf:`members[n].priority` of ``0``.

   This field only appears if there is at least one member with a
   :rsconf:`members[n].priority` of ``0``.

   Drivers use this array and the :data:`isMaster.hosts` to determine
   which members to read from.

.. data:: isMaster.arbiters

   An array of strings  in the format of ``"[hostname]:[port]"``
   listing all members of the :term:`replica set` that are
   :term:`arbiters <arbiter>`.

   This field only appears if there is at least one arbiter in the
   replica set.

.. data:: isMaster.primary

   A string in the format of ``"[hostname]:[port]"`` listing the
   current :term:`primary` member of the replica set.

.. data:: isMaster.arbiterOnly

   A boolean value that , when ``true``, indicates that the current
   instance is an :term:`arbiter`.  The :data:`~isMaster.arbiterOnly`
   field is only present, if the instance is an arbiter.

.. data:: isMaster.passive

   A boolean value that, when ``true``, indicates that the current
   instance is :term:`passive <passive member>`.  The
   :data:`~isMaster.passive` field is only present for members with a
   :rsconf:`members[n].priority` of ``0``.

.. data:: isMaster.hidden

   A boolean value that, when ``true``, indicates that the current
   instance is :term:`hidden <hidden member>`.  The
   :data:`~isMaster.hidden` field is only present for hidden members.

.. data:: isMaster.tags

   .. include:: /includes/fact-tag-set-field.rst

.. data:: isMaster.me

   The ``[hostname]:[port]`` of the member that returned
   :dbcommand:`isMaster`.

.. data:: isMaster.electionId

   .. versionadded:: 3.0.0

   A unique identifier for each election. Included only in the output
   of :dbcommand:`isMaster` for the :term:`primary`. Used by clients
   to determine when elections occur.

.. data:: isMaster.lastWrite

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

   A document containing :term:`optime` and date information for the
   database's most recent write operation.

   .. data:: isMaster.lastWrite.opTime

      An object giving the :term:`optime` of the last write operation.

   .. data:: isMaster.lastWrite.lastWriteDate

      A :bsontype:`date <data_date>` object containing the
      time of the last write operation.

   .. data:: isMaster.lastWrite.majorityOpTime

      An object giving the :term:`optime` of the last write operation
      readable by :readconcern:`majority <"majority">` reads.

      This field only appears on :program:`mongod` instances started with
      the :option:`--enableMajorityReadConcern` option.

   .. data:: isMaster.lastWrite.majorityWriteDate

      A :bsontype:`date <data_date>` object containing the
      time of the last write operation readable by
      :readconcern:`majority <"majority">` reads.

      This field only appears on :program:`mongod` instances started with
      the :option:`--enableMajorityReadConcern` option.
