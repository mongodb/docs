================================
Limit Fields in Result Documents
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

A projection document, or *projection*, controls which fields to return
in the matching documents. Use projections to limit the amount of data
MongoDB will return to the client and the amount of processing your
application will have to perform on the data it retrieves from
MongoDB.

Declare the field or fields to return by including the field in the
projection document with the value ``1``. To suppress field or fields
from the matching documents, including the field in the projection with
the value ``0``.

Consideration
-------------

A projection document *cannot* contain both suppression and inclusion
specifications with the exception of the ``_id`` field. You can
suppress the ``_id`` field in a projection document that otherwise
specifies inclusion of fields. By default, the ``_id`` field *always
returns* unless explicitly specified in the projection document to
suppress.

Operation
---------

Pass the projection specification to the :method:`db.collection.find()`
method as the *second* parameter.
