This page demonstrates how to use the MongoDB MCP Server through practical examples
with natural language prompts. Each example shows the prompt you can enter in your
AI client and an example response you might receive from the large language model (LLM).

You can use the examples on this page as starting points
for your own interactions with the MongoDB MCP Server.

.. note::

   The exact output you receive will vary depending on your data, AI client, and
   the LLM you're using. Private information such as organization
   IDs, project IDs, and passwords are redacted in these examples.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before running these examples, ensure that you have the following:

- A working :ref:`MongoDB MCP Server configuration <mcp-server-configuration>`
- Access to a MongoDB deployment with data to explore.
- :atlas:`Sample data </sample-data/>` loaded into your deployment.

Atlas Administration
--------------------

The following examples demonstrate how to manage your 
Atlas infrastructure by using the MongoDB MCP server.

View Organizations and Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get an overview of your Atlas account structure and available resources.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: text

      Show my Atlas organizations and projects

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      Ran ``atlas-list-orgs``
      Ran ``atlas-list-projects``

      Here are your MongoDB Atlas organizations and projects:

      **Organizations:**

      TestOrganization
      Organization ID: XXX

      **Projects:**

      TestProject
      Project ID: XXX
      Organization: TestOrganization
      Created: August 7, 2020 at 11:48:55 AM

      You have one organization containing one project. This
      project contains your TestCluster that we're currently
      connected to.

Create an Atlas Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set up a new Atlas project with a cluster and all necessary access configurations
in a single workflow.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: text

      Create a new Atlas project named myNewProject and create a
      free cluster named myNewCluster in the new project, add
      access list for my current IP, create a database user named
      myNewUser with read and write access to the new cluster, and
      return the connection string for the new cluster

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      I'll create a new Atlas project, free cluster, and set up
      all the necessary access details for you.

      Ran ``atlas-create-project``

      Great! I've created a new project named "myNewProject"
      in your MongoDB Atlas organization. Now let's list the
      projects to get the project ID for the new project:

      Ran ``atlas-list-projects``

      Now I'll create a free cluster named "myNewCluster" in the
      new project:

      Ran ``atlas-create-free-cluster``

      Now, I'll add your current IP address to the access list:

      Ran ``atlas-create-access-list``

      Now let's create a database user named "myNewUser" with read
      and write access:

      Ran ``atlas-create-db-user``

      Perfect! Everything has been set up successfully:

      **New Project Information:**

      Project Name: myNewProject
      Project ID: XXX

      **New Cluster Information:**

      Cluster Name: myNewCluster
      Region: US East (US_EAST_1)

      **Database User:**

      Username: myNewUser
      Password: XXX
      Access: Read and write to any database

      **Connection String:**

      mongodb+srv://myNewUser:XXX@myNewCluster.mongodb.net/

      Your current IP address has been added to the access list,
      so you should be able to connect to the cluster from your
      current location. The cluster will take a few minutes to
      fully provision and be ready for connections.

Data Exploration
----------------

The following examples demonstrate how you can use the 
MongoDB MCP Server to explore and 
understand your MongoDB data.

List Available Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Discover what databases are available in your cluster and get insights about their contents.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: text

      Show my Atlas databases

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      Ran ``list-databases``

      Here are the databases in your Atlas cluster "TestCluster":

      **Sample Databases:**

      sample_mflix - 138.4 MB (Movie database with films, theaters, users, comments)
      sample_training - 53.6 MB (Training data for learning MongoDB)
      sample_airbnb - 55.3 MB (Airbnb listings and reviews data)
      sample_analytics - 10.0 MB (Analytics and customer data)
      sample_restaurants - 6.8 MB (Restaurant and review data)
      sample_weatherdata - 2.7 MB (Weather observation data)
      sample_geospatial - 1.3 MB (Geospatial data examples)
      sample_supplies - 1.1 MB (Supply chain data)
      sample_guides - 41 KB (Getting started guides)

      **System Databases:**

      local - 4.1 GB (MongoDB internal database)
      admin - 365 KB (Administrative database)

      Your cluster contains MongoDB's sample datasets, which are
      great for learning and testing. The largest databases are
      sample_mflix (movies), sample_training, and sample_airbnb.
      Would you like me to explore any specific database or show
      you the collections within one of them?

Explore Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dive deeper into a specific database to understand its structure and collections.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: text

      Show the collections in the Atlas sample_mflix database

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      Ran ``list-collections``

      Here are the collections in the sample_mflix database:

      **Core Collections:**

      movies - Main collection containing movie data
      (titles, genres, cast, ratings, etc.)
      users - User profiles and account information
      comments - User comments and reviews on movies
      theaters - Movie theater locations and details
      sessions - User session data

      **Additional Collections:**

      embedded_movies - Movies collection with embedded/denormalized data structure

      The movies collection contains detailed information
      about films including plot, cast, directors, ratings,
      release dates, and genres. The comments collection links to
      movies and users to store user reviews and discussions.

      Would you like me to explore any specific collection in more
      detail, such as showing sample documents or collection
      statistics?

Data Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Analyize your MongoDB data to identify patterns and trends.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: text

      Summarize the Atlas movies collection by thrillers

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      I'll help you analyze the Atlas movies collection focusing
      on thrillers. First, let me check what databases are
      available in your connected cluster.

      Ran ``list-databases``

      Perfect! I can see you have the sample_mflix database which
      contains the movies collection. Let me check the collections
      in that database:

      Ran ``list-collections``

      Great! Now let me analyze the movies collection to find
      thrillers and provide a summary. First, let me check the
      schema to understand how genres are stored:

      Ran ``collection-schema``

      Perfect! I can see that genres are stored as an array of
      strings. Now let me get a count of thriller movies and then
      perform an aggregation to summarize them:

      Ran ``count``

      Now let me create a comprehensive summary of thriller movies
      using aggregation:

      Ran ``aggregate``

      I see there are some data quality issues. Let me get better
      data by filtering for movies with numeric ratings:

      Ran ``aggregate``

      Now let me get some more summary statistics by decade:

      Ran ``aggregate``

      Here's a comprehensive analysis of thriller movies in your
      Atlas sample_mflix collection:

      **Overall Statistics**

      Total Thriller Movies: 2,454 films
      Time Span: 1924 to 2011
      Average Rating: 6.3/10 (IMDb)
      Average Runtime: 105 minutes
      Total IMDb Votes: 85.8 million across all thrillers

      **Top-Rated Thriller Movies**

      Drishyam (2013) - 8.9/10 - Indian thriller directed by Jeethu Joseph
      Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979) - 8.7/10 - British spy thriller
      Rear Window (1954) - 8.6/10 - Alfred Hitchcock classic
      The Silence of the Lambs (1991) - 8.6/10 - Psychological thriller
      Se7en (1995) - 8.6/10 - David Fincher crime thriller
      The Usual Suspects (1995) - 8.6/10 - Neo-noir mystery
      Léon: The Professional (1994) - 8.6/10 - Action thriller
      Psycho (1960) - 8.6/10 - Another Hitchcock masterpiece
      Memento (2000) - 8.5/10 - Christopher Nolan psychological thriller

      **Trends by Decade**

      1920s-1950s: Few thrillers but high quality (avg 7.2-7.8 rating)
      1960s-1970s: Growing popularity, still maintaining quality
      1980s: Significant growth (200 films), quality decline begins
      1990s: Peak production era (417 films), avg 6.3 rating
      2000s: Highest volume (854 films), avg 6.24 rating
      2010s: 730 films, lowest average rating (6.12)

      The data shows that while thriller production increased
      dramatically from the 1980s onward, the average quality (as
      measured by IMDb ratings) has generally declined, suggesting
      the genre became more commercialized with higher volume but
      potentially lower artistic standards in recent decades.

Database Operations
-------------------

The following examples demonstrate how to use the 
MongoDB MCP Server to perform common database operations.

Insert New Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add new data to your collections.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: text

      Add a document to the movies_copy collection

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      I'll add a new document to the movies_copy collection. Let
      me create a sample movie document with the same structure as
      the existing movies:

      Ran ``insert-many``

      Perfect! I've successfully added a new movie document to the
      movies_copy collection. Here's what I added:

      **New Movie Added:**

      Title: "The AI Thriller"
      Genres: Thriller, Sci-Fi, Drama
      Year: 2024
      Runtime: 118 minutes
      IMDb Rating: 7.8/10 (125,000 votes)
      Cast: John Smith, Sarah Johnson, Michael Chen
      Director: Alex Rodriguez
      Rating: PG-13

      The document was inserted with ID: 684b15fb5084ddef1f265e8f

      Let me verify the collection now has one additional
      document:

      Ran ``count``

      Confirmed! The movies_copy collection now contains 21,350
      documents (up from 21,349), including your new thriller
      movie about AI consciousness.

Create New Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create and customize new collections.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: text

      Create a new collection to store movie purchases data that
      includes geospatial and timeseries fields

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      I'll create a new collection for storing movie purchases
      data with geospatial and timeseries fields. Let me first
      create the collection and then add some sample documents
      with the appropriate structure.

      Ran ``create-collection``

      Now I'll insert sample documents that include geospatial
      data (customer location, theater location) and timeseries
      data (purchase timestamp, viewing timestamp):

      Ran ``insert-many``

      Perfect! I've created the movie_purchases collection with
      sample data that includes both geospatial and timeseries
      fields. Here's what the collection contains:

      **Collection Structure**

      **Geospatial Fields:**

      customer_location: GeoJSON Point with customer's coordinates
      theater_location: GeoJSON Point with theater coordinates
      customer_address: Human-readable address information

      **Timeseries Fields:**

      purchase_timestamp: When the purchase was made
      viewing_timestamp: When the movie was actually watched
      viewing_duration_minutes: How long the customer watched
      completion_percentage: Percentage of movie completed

      **Sample Data Added:**

      Purchase 1: Customer in San Francisco bought "The Shawshank Redemption" rental for $12.99
      Purchase 2: Customer in New York purchased "Pulp Fiction" for $15.99
      Purchase 3: Customer in Los Angeles rented "Se7en" for $9.99

      Now let me create a geospatial index to optimize
      location-based queries:

      Ran ``create-index``

      Excellent! The movie_purchases collection is now ready with:

      - Geospatial capabilities - 2dsphere index for location-based queries
      - Timeseries optimization - Index on purchase timestamps
      - Sample data - 3 purchase records across different US cities

      This collection can now support queries like:

      - Finding purchases within a certain radius of a location
      - Analyzing purchase patterns over time
      - Correlating viewing behavior with geographic regions
      - Time-based analytics and trending

Copy an Existing Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a backup or duplicate of an existing collection.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: text

      Make a copy of the movies collection named movies_copy

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      I'll create a copy of the movies collection named
      movies_copy. I'll use an aggregation pipeline with $out to
      copy all documents from the movies collection to a new
      movies_copy collection.

      Ran ``aggregate``

      Perfect! I've successfully created a copy of the movies
      collection named movies_copy. Let me verify the copy was
      created correctly by checking the document count:

      Ran ``count``

      Found 21349 documents in the collection "movies_copy"

      Excellent! The movies_copy collection has been successfully
      created with all 21,349 documents from the original movies
      collection. The copy operation completed successfully and
      you now have an identical backup of your movies collection.

.. _mcp-server-example-export-data:

Data Export and Sharing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example demonstrates how to export query results 
for sharing or further processing in external tools.

Generate comprehensive reports and export them for use in other applications
or for sharing with team members.

.. include:: /includes/export-data.rst

The export file is stored in the file system path specified by the
``exportPath`` configuration option. The export file is eligible for
deletion after the time period specified by the ``exportTimeout``
configuration option. For additional details, see
:ref:`mcp-server-configuration-export-data`.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: text

      Summarize and export the contents of the movies collection.

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      I'll help you summarize and export the contents of the movies
      collection from your connected MongoDB Atlas cluster. Let's do
      this in two steps:

      1. First, I'll create a summary of the movies collection using an
         aggregation pipeline.
      2. Then I'll export the results using the export tool.

      Let's start by getting a summary of the movies collection:

      Ran ``aggregate``

      Now that we have a summary of the movies collection, let's create
      a more focused dataset to export. Let's get the top 10
      highest-rated movies:

      Ran ``aggregate``

      Now, let's export this data using the MCP Server export tool:

      Ran ``export``

      I've successfully summarized and exported the contents of the
      movies collection from your MongoDB Atlas cluster. Here's a
      breakdown of what I did:

      **Movies Collection Summary**

      **Collection Overview:**
      The collection contains 21,349 movie documents

.. _mcp-server-examples-local-atlas-deployments:

Local Atlas Deployments
-----------------------

The following examples show how to use the MongoDB MCP Server to
interact with and create local Atlas deployments.

List Local Atlas Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example lists local Atlas deployments.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: text

      List all local Atlas deployments.

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      I'll list all the local Atlas deployments for you.

      Ran ``atlas-local-list-deployments``
      
      Here are all your local Atlas deployments:

      Found 1 deployment:

      Deployment Name  State     MongoDB Version
      local7356        Running   8.2.1

      You currently have one Atlas Local deployment named local7356
      that is running MongoDB version 8.2.1.

Connect to Local Atlas Deployment and List Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example connects to a local Atlas deployment named
``local7356`` and lists the databases.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: text

      Connect to my local Atlas deployment local7356 and list the
      databases.

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      I'll connect to your local Atlas deployment local7356 and then
      list the databases.

      Ran ``atlas-local-connect-deployment``

      Now I'll list the databases in this deployment:

      Ran ``list-databases``

      Successfully connected to Atlas Local deployment local7356! Here
      are the databases in this deployment:

      Found 4 databases:

      admin - 262,144 bytes (256 KB)
      config - 237,568 bytes (~232 KB)
      local - 1,163,264 bytes (~1.1 MB)
      testdb - 438,272 bytes (~428 KB)

      Your local Atlas deployment contains:

      System databases: admin, config, and local (standard MongoDB
      system databases)
      
      User database: testdb (your custom database)

      The local database has grown to about 1.1 MB, which is normal for
      local operations and metadata storage. Would you like me to
      explore any of these databases further, such as showing the
      collections in testdb?

Create New Local Atlas Deployment with Database and Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example creates a new local Atlas deployment with a
database and an example collection. To run the example, you must disable
:ref:`read only mode <mcp-server-configuration-read-only-mode>`.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: text

      Create a new local Atlas deployment, connect to it, create a
      collection with sample pizza orders data, and then retrieve the
      sample data.

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      I'll help you create a new local Atlas deployment, connect to it,
      create a collection with sample pizza orders data, and then
      retrieve it. Let me break this down into steps:

      Created 4 todos

      Now let me start with the first task:

      Starting (1/4) Create new local Atlas deployment

      Ran ``atlas-local-create-deployment``

      Great! Created deployment local5528. Now let me mark that as
      completed and connect to it:

      Starting (2/4) Connect to new deployment

      Ran ``atlas-local-connect-deployment``

      Perfect! Now let me create the pizza orders collection with sample
      data:

      Starting (3/4) Create pizza orders collection

      Ran ``create-collection``

      Now let me insert sample pizza orders data:

      Great! Now let me retrieve and display the sample data:

      Starting (4/4) Retrieve and display sample data

      Ran ``find``

      Completed (4/4) Retrieve and display sample data

      Perfect! I've successfully completed all the tasks. Here's a
      summary of what was accomplished:

Delete Local Atlas Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example deletes a local Atlas deployment named
``local5528``. To run the example, you must disable :ref:`read only mode
<mcp-server-configuration-read-only-mode>`.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: text

      Delete my local Atlas deployment local5528.

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      I'll delete your local Atlas deployment local5528 for you.

      Ran ``atlas-local-delete-deployment``

After the ``atlas-local-delete-deployment`` tool deletes the local Atlas
deployment, the AI client might respond that the deployment has already
been deleted. This is because the ``atlas-local-delete-deployment`` tool
ran successfully and the local Atlas deployment no longer exists.

            Ran ``atlas-get-performance-advisor``

            I found extensive slow query logs for ClusterM10. Here's a summary of the slow queries detected:

            **Query Types and Patterns**

            **Most Common Slow Queries:**

            **Collection Statistics Queries ($collStats)**
            - **Collections**: SchemaAdvisor.Call to Action: Remove unnecessary indexes and SchemaAdvisor.Call to Action: Remove unnecessary indexes 2
            - **Duration**: 30-100+ milliseconds
            - **Pattern**: These are MongoDB Automation Agent queries collecting storage statistics
            - **Frequency**: Very frequent (every 10 minutes)

            **Collection Statistics for mcp_db.new**
            - **Duration**: 30-60+ milliseconds
            - **Pattern**: Similar $collStats operations

            **Find Query on sample_db.test**
            - **Query**: {"find": "dbC", "filter": {"z": 10}}
            - **Duration**: 5 milliseconds
            - **Plan**: COLLSCAN (Collection Scan)
            - **Performance Issue**: Examined 10,001 documents but only returned 1
            - This matches the index suggestion we saw earlier!

            **Key Performance Issues**

            **Inefficient Query on sample_db.test:**
            - The find query {"z": 10} is doing a full collection scan
            - This directly relates to the index suggestion we found: creating an index on field z would significantly improve this query
            - Currently examining 10,001 documents to find 1 result

            **Automation Agent Overhead:**
            - Many slow queries are from MongoDB Automation Agent collecting statistics
            - These are system-level operations that run regularly
            - Duration typically 30-100ms, which is acceptable for system operations

            **Recommendations**

            **Implement the Suggested Index:**
            - Create an index on {"z": 1} for the sample_db.test collection
            - This will eliminate the collection scan and dramatically improve the find query performance

            **Monitor Automation Agent Performance:**
            - The frequent $collStats operations are normal but worth monitoring
            - Consider if the collection statistics collection frequency can be optimized

            The most actionable finding is the inefficient query on sample_db.test that would benefit from the index suggestion we identified earlier.

            Ran ``atlas-get-performance-advisor``

            Based on the performance advisor data I retrieved for ClusterM10, here's an assessment of your cluster performance:

            **Overall Performance Assessment: Good with Room for Optimization**

            **✅ Positive Indicators**
            - **Query Response Times**: Most queries are completing in reasonable timeframes (30-100ms)
            - **No Critical Issues**: No extremely slow queries (>1000ms) detected
            - **Stable Operations**: Consistent performance patterns over time
            - **System Health**: MongoDB Automation Agent operations are functioning normally

            **⚠️ Areas for Improvement**

            **Inefficient Query Pattern:**
            - **Issue**: Find query {"z": 10} on sample_db.test collection
            - **Current**: Full collection scan examining 10,001 documents
            - **Impact**: Unnecessary resource consumption
            - **Solution**: Implement suggested index on field z

            **Resource Utilization:**
            - **CPU Usage**: Queries consuming 5-45+ CPU nanoseconds
            - **Memory**: Response sizes up to 602KB for statistics queries
            - **I/O**: Some queries showing storage read operations

            **📊 Performance Metrics Summary**
            - **Slow Query Count**: 50+ entries in recent logs
            - **Average Query Duration**: 30-100ms (acceptable range)
            - **Most Common Operations**: Collection statistics gathering
            - **Index Optimization Opportunity**: 1 significant improvement identified

            **🎯 Immediate Recommendations**

            **High Priority**: Create index {"z": 1} on sample_db.test collection
            - **Expected Impact**: Eliminate collection scan, reduce query time from 5ms to <1ms
            - **Resource Savings**: Reduce CPU and I/O usage significantly

            **Medium Priority**: Monitor automation agent performance
            - Current 30-100ms for $collStats operations is acceptable
            - Consider optimizing if frequency becomes problematic

            **📈 Performance Grade: B+**

            Your cluster is performing well overall, but implementing the suggested index would elevate it to an A-grade performance level. The main bottleneck is the inefficient query pattern that can be easily resolved with proper indexing.

            Would you like me to help you implement the suggested index or dive deeper into any specific performance metrics?

Get Index Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the Performance Advisor to suggest indexes to create or drop
to improve performance.

   .. input::
      :language: text
      
      What indexes should I create or drop to improve performance?

   .. output::
      :language: text
      :visible: false

      Ran ``atlas-get-performance-advisor``

      Based on the performance advisor analysis of your MongoDB Atlas cluster "ClusterM10", here are the specific index recommendations:

      **Index to CREATE:**

      **High Priority - Create Index on sample_db.test collection:**
      - **Index**: { "z": 1 }
      - **Weight**: 1,020,000 bytes (≈ 1.02 MB saved per query)
      - **Impact**: This index will significantly improve performance for queries filtering on the z field
      - **Reason**: The slow query logs show a query {"z": 10} that performed a collection scan (COLLSCAN) and examined 10,001 documents to return just 1 result

      **Indexes to DROP:**

      **No Drop Recommendations Found**

      The performance advisor found no indexes that should be dropped at this time.

      **Additional Performance Insights:**

      **Schema Recommendations:**
      - **Remove Unnecessary Indexes**: You have collections with more than 30 indexes, which can impact write performance
      - **Reduce Document Size**: Some documents exceed 2MB, which can cause performance issues
      - **Avoid Unbounded Arrays**: Some collections have arrays with over 10,000 entries

      **Slow Query Analysis:**

      The slow query logs show that most slow queries are from MongoDB's internal automation agent running $collStats operations, which is normal. However, there's one user query that would benefit significantly from the suggested index:

      - **Query**: db.dbC.find({"z": 10})
      - **Current Performance**: Collection scan examining 10,001 documents
      - **Expected Improvement**: With the suggested index, this should become an index scan examining only the matching documents

      **Recommended Action:**

      Create the index { "z": 1 } on the sample_db.test collection. This single index creation could save approximately 1MB of disk reads per query execution for queries filtering on the z field.

      :visible: false

      Ran ``atlas-get-performance-advisor``

      Based on the performance advisor analysis of your MongoDB Atlas cluster, here are the specific schema improvements recommended:

      **Critical Schema Issues Found:**

      **1. Remove Unnecessary Indexes**

      **Collections Affected:**
      - SchemaAdvisor.Call to Action: Remove unnecessary indexes
      - SchemaAdvisor.Call to Action: Remove unnecessary indexes 2

      **Issue**: Both collections have more than 30 indexes each

      **Impact:**
      - Slower write operations
      - Increased storage overhead
      - Longer index maintenance time
      - Reduced memory efficiency

      **Recommendation:**
      - Audit all indexes in these collections
      - Remove indexes that are not actively used by your queries
      - Keep only indexes that support your application's query patterns
      - Consider compound indexes instead of multiple single-field indexes

      **2. Reduce Document Size**

      **Collections Affected:**
      - SchemaAdvisor.Call to Action: Reduce the size of documents
      - SchemaAdvisor.Call to Action: Reduce the size of documents 2

      **Issue**: Documents larger than 2MB found

      **Impact:**
      - Documents cannot be stored in MongoDB (16MB limit)
      - Performance degradation for large documents
      - Increased memory usage
      - Slower network transfer

      **Recommendations:**
      - Split large documents into smaller, related documents
      - Use GridFS for storing large binary data
      - Normalize data by moving large arrays or objects to separate collections
      - Archive old data to reduce document size
      - Compress data where appropriate

      **3. Avoid Unbounded Arrays**

      **Collections Affected:**
      - SchemaAdvisor.Call to Action: Avoid using unbounded arrays in documents

      **Issue**: Arrays with over 10,000 entries detected

      **Impact:**
      - Poor query performance on array elements
      - Memory consumption issues
      - Index inefficiency
      - Difficult to maintain and update

      **Recommendations:**
      - Move large arrays to separate collections with references
      - Implement pagination for array access
      - Use embedded documents with limits (e.g., max 100 items)
      - Consider denormalization for frequently accessed array elements
