The :guilabel:`Advanced` connection tab provides additional connection options 
for your deployment. These options can be used with the 
:ref:`General <general-connection-tab>`, :ref:`Authentication 
<authentication-connection-tab>`, :ref:`TLS / SSL <tls-ssl-tab>`, and 
:ref:`Proxy / SSH Tunnel <ssh-connection>` connection options. 

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`New Connection` modal.

      .. include:: /includes/open-new-connection.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Advanced Connection Options`.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Advanced` tab.

      (Optional) Select a :guilabel:`Read Preference` from the following 
      options:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 50 50 

         * - Read Preference
           - Description

         * - Primary
           - Default mode. All operations read from the current replica set primary.
             If the primary is unavailable, the operation fails. 

         * - Primary Preferred
           - Operations read from the primary unless the primary is unavailable. 
             If the primary is unavailable, operations read from secondary members.

         * - Secondary
           - All operations read from the secondary members of the replica set.
             If the secondary is unavailable, the operation fails.  

         * - Secondary Preferred
           - Operations read from the secondary unless the secondary is unavailable.
             If the secondary is unavailable, operations read from the primary 
             on sharded clusters.

         * - Nearest
           - Operations read from a random eligible replica set member, 
             irrespective of whether that member is a primary or secondary, based 
             on a specified latency threshold. The operation considers the following 
             when calculating latency:

             - The :manual:`localThresholdMS 
               </reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.localThresholdMS>` 
               connection string option. 
             - The :manual:`maxStalenessSeconds 
               </core/read-preference-staleness/#read-preference-maxstalenessseconds>` 
               read preference option. 
             - Any specified tag sets.

      Additional Optional Fields
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 50 50 
      
         * - Field
           - Description

         * - Replica Set Name
           - (Optional) Name of replica set.

         * - Default Authentication Database
           - (Optional) Authentication database used when authSource is not specified.
             For more information, see :manual:`Authentication Options 
             </reference/connection-string/#authentication-options>`.

         * - URI Options
           - Additional options to customize your connection. You 
             specify these options as key-value pairs, and |compass-short| 
             automatically adds the key-value pairs to the connection string. 
             For more information, see :manual:`Connection String Options 
             </reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options>`.

   .. step:: Click Connect.

   To disconnect from your deployment, see :ref:`<disconnect-tab>`. 

Example
-------

The following example specifies a connection with a read preference of
:guilabel:`Secondary Preferred` in the :guilabel:`Advanced` tab. The
:guilabel:`Secondary Preferred` read preference prevents queries from
overloading the primary node.
