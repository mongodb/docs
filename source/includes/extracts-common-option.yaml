  This option is mutually exclusive with the ``typeMap`` option.
---
ref: common-option-collation
content: |
  :manual:`Collation </reference/collation>` allows users to specify
  language-specific rules for string comparison, such as rules for lettercase
  and accent marks. When specifying collation, the ``locale`` field is
  mandatory; all other collation fields are optional. For descriptions of the
  fields, see :manual:`Collation Document </reference/collation/#collation-document>`.

ref: common-option-comment
content: |
  Enables users to specify an arbitrary comment to help trace the operation
  through the :manual:`database profiler </reference/database-profiler>`,

ref: common-option-comment-string-before-6.0

  versions only support string values.
---
ref: common-option-hint

  The index to use. Specify either the index name as a string or the index key
  pattern as a document. If specified, then the query system will only consider
  plans using the hinted index.

ref: common-option-let

  Map of parameter names and values. Values must be constant or closed

  This feature is not supported for MongoDB server versions 6.0 and
  earlier. If used, the server returns an exception at execution time.
