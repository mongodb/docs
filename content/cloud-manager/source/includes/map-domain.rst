Map your Domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mapping your domain to the |idp| lets |mms| know that users from your
domain should be directed to the :guilabel:`Login URL` for
your identity provider configuration.

When users visit the |mms| login page, they enter their email address.
If the email domain is associated with an IdP, they are sent to the
Login URL for that IdP.
