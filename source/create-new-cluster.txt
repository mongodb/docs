Introduction
------------

A cluster is a MongoDB :term:`replica set` or :term:`sharded cluster`. A
|service| group can have multiple MongoDB clusters. Each cluster runs the
latest stable release of MongoDB and uses the :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>` storage engine.

When creating a cluster, you select the options described in the steps below.
As you build your cluster, |service| displays the associated costs. When you
complete the cluster, you enter your :doc:`payment information </billing>`.

If you are creating the first MongoDB cluster in a group, you will also create
your first MongoDB user, which will be an administrative user. The admin user
will have access to any database in any MongoDB cluster in the group. When
creating the user, you can optionally have |service| generate the user's
password. If you do, you **must** copy and save the password when it is
displayed. |service| displays it only once.

.. important::

   You must save the admin password or you will lose admin access to your
   MongoDB databases until you reset the password.
