   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``mode``

     - String that specifies whether the balancer thread is running
       or stopped. Possible values are:

       - "full"
           Balancer thread is running but not necessarily in a
           balancing round.

       - "off"
           Balancer thread is stopped. Chunk balancing cannot occur in
           this mode.
   
   * - ``inBalancerRound``

     - Boolean that specifies if the balancer is currently in a
       balancing round.

   * - ``numBalancerRounds``

     - Number of balancer rounds which have occurred since the
       config servers were started. This value is reset to 0 when 
       the config servers are restarted.

   * - ``ok``

     - See :ref:`Command Response <command-response>`.

   * - ``$clusterTime``

     - See :ref:`Command Response <command-response>`.

   * - ``operationTime``

     - See :ref:`Command Response <command-response>`.
