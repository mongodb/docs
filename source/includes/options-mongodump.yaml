program: mongodump
name: db
aliases: -d
directive: option
args:  <database>
description: |
  Specifies a database to backup. If you do not specify a database,
  :binary:`~bin.mongodump` copies all databases in this instance into the dump
  files.
  
  .. note::
   
      You cannot specify both {{role}} and :option:`--uri`.

optional: true
---
program: mongodump
name: collection
aliases: -c
directive: option
args: <collection>
description: |
  Specifies a collection to backup. If you do not specify a collection,
  this option copies all collections in the specified database or instance
  to the dump files.
optional: true
---
program: mongodump
name: out
aliases: -o
directive: option
args: <path>
description: |
  Specifies the directory where :binary:`~bin.mongodump` will write
  :term:`BSON` files for the dumped databases. By default,
  :binary:`~bin.mongodump` saves output files in a directory named
  ``dump`` in the current working directory.

  To send the database dump to standard output, specify "``-``" instead of
  a path. Write to standard output if you want process the output before
  saving it, such as to use ``gzip`` to compress the dump. When writing
  standard output, :binary:`~bin.mongodump` does not write the metadata that
  writes in a ``<dbname>.metadata.json`` file when writing to files
  directly.

  You cannot use the ``--archive`` option with the
  :option:`--out` option.

optional: true

program: mongodump
name: query
aliases: -q
directive: option
args: <json>
description: |
  Provides a :term:`JSON document` as a query that optionally limits the
  documents included in the output of :binary:`~bin.mongodump`.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-quote-command-line-query.rst

optional: true
---
program: mongodump
name: queryFile
directive: option
args: <path>
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 3.2

  Specifies the path to a file containing a JSON document as a query
  filter that limits the documents included in the output of
  :binary:`~bin.mongodump`. {{role}} enables you to create query filters that
  are too large to fit in your terminal's buffer.
optional: true
---
program: mongodump
name: oplog
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Creates a file named :file:`oplog.bson` as part of the
  :binary:`~bin.mongodump` output. The :file:`oplog.bson` file, located in
  the top level of the output directory, contains oplog entries that
  occur during the :binary:`~bin.mongodump` operation. This file provides
  an effective point-in-time snapshot of the state of a
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. To restore to a specific point-in-time
  backup, use the output created with this option in conjunction with
  :option:`mongorestore --oplogReplay`.

  Without {{role}}, if there are write operations during the dump
  operation, the dump will not reflect a single moment in time. Changes
  made to the database during the update process can affect the output of
  the backup.

  {{role}} has no effect when running :binary:`~bin.mongodump`
  against a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance to dump the entire contents of a
  sharded cluster. However, you can use {{role}} to dump
  individual shards.

  {{role}} only works against nodes that maintain an
  :term:`oplog`. This includes all members of a replica set.

  {{role}} does not dump the oplog collection.

  .. note::

     To use :binary:`~bin.mongodump` with {{role}}, you must create a full dump of
     a :term:`replica set` member. :binary:`~bin.mongodump` with  {{role}} fails
     if you use any of the following options to limit the data to be dumped:

     - :option:`--db`
     - :option:`--collection`

  .. seealso:: :option:`mongorestore --oplogReplay`

optional: true

program: mongodump
name: forceTableScan
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  
  By default, {{program}} uses the ``_id`` index when scanning
  collections with that index is available (e.g. 
  :ref:`3.4-reference-views` do not have any indexes). Specify {{role}} 
  to direct {{program}} to scan collection data without the use of the 
  ``_id`` index. 

  {{role}} does not ensure a point-in-time snapshot. Use
  :option:`--oplog` to create a point-in-time snapshot.

  You cannot use {{role}} with the :option:`--query` option.

optional: true
---
program: mongodump
name: dumpDbUsersAndRoles
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  Includes user and role definitions in the database's dump directory
  when performing :binary:`~bin.mongodump` on a specific database. This
  option applies only when you specify a database in the
  :option:`--db` option. MongoDB always includes user and role
  definitions when :binary:`~bin.mongodump` applies to an entire instance
  and not just a specific database.
optional: true
---
program: mongodump
name: excludeCollection
directive: option
args: string
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 3.0

  Excludes the specified collection from the {{program}} output.
  To exclude multiple collections, specify the {{role}} multiple times.

optional: true
---
program: mongodump
name: excludeCollectionsWithPrefix
directive: option
args: string
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 3.0

  Excludes all collections with a specified prefix from the {{program}}
  outputs. To specify multiple prefixes, specify the {{role}} multiple
  times.

optional: true
---
program: mongodump
name: archive
directive: option
args: <file or null>
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 3.2

  Writes the output to a single archive file or to the standard output
  (``stdout``).

  To output the dump to an archive file, run :binary:`~bin.mongodump` with the new
  ``--archive`` option and the archive filename.

  To output the dump to the standard output stream in order to pipe to
  another process, run :binary:`~bin.mongodump` with the ``archive`` option
  but *omit* the filename.

  You cannot use the ``--archive`` option with the
  :option:`--out` option.
optional: true
---
program: mongodump
name: gzip
directive: option
args: null
description: |
  .. versionadded:: 3.2

  Compresses the output. If :binary:`~bin.mongodump` outputs to the dump
  directory, the new feature compresses the individual files. The files
  have the suffix ``.gz``.

  If :binary:`~bin.mongodump` outputs to an archive file or the standard
  out stream, the new feature compresses the archive file or the data
  output to the stream.

description: |
  When specified, {{program}} exports :doc:`read-only views
  </core/views>` as collections. For each view, {{program}} will
  produce a BSON file containing the documents in the view. If you
  :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` the produced BSON file, the view will be
  restored as a :term:`collection`.

  If you do *not* include {{role}},
  {{program}} captures each view's metadata. If you include a
  view's metadata file in a :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` operation, the view
  is recreated.
