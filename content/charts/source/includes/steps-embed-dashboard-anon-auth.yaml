level: 4
content: |

   Specify the fields on which dashboard viewers can filter data. By
   default, no fields are specified, meaning the dashboard cannot be
   filtered until you explicitly allow at least one field.

   Alternatively, you can specify all the fields in your dashboard by
   selecting :guilabel:`Allow all fields in the data source used in this
   dashboard`.

   To learn more about filterable fields, see
   :ref:`specify-filter-fields`.
