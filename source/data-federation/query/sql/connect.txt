Get Your Connection Information
-------------------------------

After you configure your {+fdi+}, you can connect to it from various
|bi| tools or from the MongoDB Shell. To find the information you need to connect, select 
:guilabel:`Connect using the {+asql+} interface` in the 
{+fdi+} connection modal.

Connect with a BI Tool
----------------------

.. note::
   
   To connect to your {+fdi+} with the MongoDB Shell, 
   see :ref:`sql-connect-shell`.

To connect to your {+fdi+} with a |bi| tool, you can use a *custom connector* with 
its associated and officially supported BI tool, or a *standalone driver* to 
integrate with a BI tool of your choice.

.. _sql-custom-connectors:

Custom Connectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports and regularly updates the following custom Atlas SQL 
connectors. To ensure a successful connection and support for the 
full range of Atlas SQL capabilities, use one of the following custom connectors
with its associated BI tool:

- :ref:`Tableau <sql-connect-tableau>`
- :ref:`Power BI <sql-connect-powerbi>`

.. _sql-standalone-drivers:

Standalone Drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: 
   If you use a standalone driver with a BI tool that MongoDB doesn't officially
   support, you must test the features of Atlas SQL that you want to use in order 
   to confirm they are supported by that tool.
   
   MongoDB can't guarantee that all BI tools are fully supported.

MongoDB provides the Atlas SQL standalone JDBC and ODBC drivers for
experimentation and custom integration with SQL-92 dialect-based 
third-party BI tools that support a generic ODBC or JDBC driver connection.
Use the type of driver that your BI tool specifies:

- :ref:`JDBC driver <sql-connect-jdbc>`
- :ref:`ODBC driver <sql-connect-odbc>`
