In the general case, the upgrade from MongoDB 2.4 to 2.6 is a
binary-compatible "drop-in" upgrade: shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances and replace them with :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances running
2.6. **However**, before you attempt any upgrade, familiarize yourself
with the content of this document, particularly the
:ref:`2.6-upgrade-considerations`, the procedure for :ref:`upgrading
sharded clusters <2.6-upgrade-cluster>`, and the considerations for
:ref:`reverting to 2.4 after running 2.6
<2.6-downgrade-considerations>`.

.. _2.6-upgrade-considerations:

Upgrade Recommendations and Checklists
--------------------------------------

When upgrading, consider the following:

Upgrade Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade an existing MongoDB deployment to 2.6, you must be running
2.4. If you're running a version of MongoDB before 2.4, you *must*
upgrade to 2.4 before upgrading to 2.6. See
:doc:`/release-notes/2.4-upgrade` for the procedure to upgrade from
2.2 to 2.4.

If you use |mms-home| Backup, ensure that you're running *at least* version
``v20131216.1`` of the Backup agent before upgrading. Version ``1.4.0`` of
the backup agent followed ``v20131216.1``

.. include:: /includes/replacement-mms.rst

Preparedness
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before upgrading MongoDB always test your application in a staging
environment before deploying the upgrade to your production
environment.

To begin the upgrade procedure, connect a 2.6 ``mongo`` shell to
your MongoDB 2.4 :binary:`~bin.mongos` or :binary:`~bin.mongod` and run the
:v2.6:`db.upgradeCheckAllDBs()
</reference/method/db.upgradeCheckAllDBs>` to check your data set for
compatibility. This is a preliminary automated check. Assess and
resolve all issues identified by :v2.6:`db.upgradeCheckAllDBs()
</reference/method/db.upgradeCheckAllDBs>`.

Some changes in MongoDB 2.6 require manual checks and
intervention. See :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-compatibility` for an
explanation of these changes. Resolve all incompatibilities in your
deployment before continuing.

For a deployment that uses authentication and authorization, be sure
you have at least one user in the ``admin`` database with the role
:authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` **before** upgrading the MongoDB
binaries. For deployments currently using
authentication and authorization, see the :ref:`consideration for
deployments that use authentication and authorization
<2.6-upgrade-auth-prereq>`.

.. _2.6-upgrade-auth-prereq:

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.6 includes significant changes to the authorization model,
which requires changes to the way that MongoDB stores users'
credentials. As a result, in addition to upgrading MongoDB processes,
if your deployment uses authentication and authorization, after
upgrading all MongoDB process to 2.6 you **must** also upgrade the
authorization model.

**Before** beginning the upgrade process for a deployment that uses
authentication and authorization:

- Ensure that at least one user exists in the ``admin`` database with
  the role :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`.

- If your application performs CRUD operations on the
  ``system.users`` collection or uses a
  ``db.addUser()``\ -like method, then you **must**
  upgrade those drivers (i.e. client libraries) **before**
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

- You must fully complete the upgrade procedure for *all* MongoDB
  processes before upgrading the authorization model.

After you begin to upgrade a MongoDB deployment that uses
authentication to 2.6, you *cannot* modify existing user data until
you complete the :doc:`authorization user schema upgrade
</release-notes/2.6-upgrade-authorization>`.

See :ref:`2.6-upgrade-authorization-model` for a complete discussion
of the upgrade procedure for the authorization model including
additional requirements and procedures.

Downgrade Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once upgraded to MongoDB 2.6, you **cannot** downgrade to **any** version
earlier than MongoDB 2.4. If you created ``text`` or ``2dsphere``
indexes while running 2.6, you can only downgrade to MongoDB 2.4.10 or
later.

Package Upgrades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed MongoDB from the MongoDB ``apt`` or ``yum`` repositories,
upgrade to 2.6 using the package manager.

For Debian, Ubuntu, and related operating systems, type these commands:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install mongodb-org

For Red Hat Enterprise, CentOS, Fedora, or Amazon Linux:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sudo yum install mongodb-org

If you did not install the ``mongodb-org`` package, and installed a subset
of MongoDB components replace ``mongodb-org`` in the commands above with
the appropriate package names.

See installation instructions for :ref:`Ubuntu 
<install-mdb-community-ubuntu>`, :ref:`RHEL 
<install-mdb-community-redhat-centos>`, :ref:`Debian 
<install-mdb-community-debian>` for a list of the available packages and 
complete MongoDB installation instructions.


Upgrade MongoDB Processes
-------------------------

.. _2.6-upgrade-standalone:

Upgrade Standalone ``mongod`` Instance to MongoDB 2.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a standalone
:binary:`~bin.mongod` from version 2.4 to 2.6. To upgrade from version
2.2 to 2.6, :doc:`upgrade to version 2.4
</release-notes/2.4-upgrade>` *first*, and then follow the procedure to
upgrade from 2.4 to 2.6.

#. Download binaries of the latest release in the 2.6 series from the
   `MongoDB Download Page`_. See :doc:`/installation` for more
   information.

#. Shut down your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. Replace the existing
   binary with the 2.6 :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary and restart :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

.. _`MongoDB Download Page`: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

.. _2.6-upgrade-replica-set:

Upgrade a Replica Set to 2.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a replica set from
MongoDB 2.4 to MongoDB 2.6. To upgrade from MongoDB 2.2 to 2.6,
:doc:`upgrade all members of the replica set to version 2.4
</release-notes/2.4-upgrade>` *first*, and then follow the procedure to
upgrade from MongoDB 2.4 to 2.6.

You can upgrade from MongoDB 2.4 to 2.6 using a "rolling" upgrade to
minimize downtime by upgrading the members individually while the other
members are available:

.. include:: /includes/steps/2.6-upgrade-replica-set.rst

Replica set failover is not instant but will render the set
unavailable accept writes until the failover process
completes. Typically this takes 30 seconds or more: schedule the
upgrade procedure during a scheduled maintenance window.

.. _2.6-upgrade-cluster:

Upgrade a Sharded Cluster to 2.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only upgrade sharded clusters to 2.6 if **all** members of the
cluster are currently running instances of 2.4. The only supported
upgrade path for sharded clusters running 2.2 is via 2.4. The upgrade
process checks all components of the cluster and will produce warnings
if any component is running version 2.2.

Considerations
``````````````

The upgrade process does not require any downtime. However, while you
upgrade the sharded cluster, ensure that clients do not make changes
to the collection meta-data. For example, during the upgrade, do **not**
do any of the following:

- :method:`sh.enableSharding()`

- :method:`sh.shardCollection()`

- :method:`sh.addShard()`

- :method:`db.createCollection()`

- :method:`db.collection.drop()`

- :method:`db.dropDatabase()`

- any operation that creates a database

- any other operation that modifies the cluster metadata in any
  way. See :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list
  of sharding commands. Note, however, that not all commands on
  the :doc:`/reference/sharding` page modifies the
  cluster meta-data.

Upgrade Sharded Clusters
````````````````````````

*Optional but Recommended.* As a precaution, take a backup of the
``config`` database *before* upgrading the sharded cluster.

.. include:: /includes/steps/2.6-upgrade-sharded-cluster.rst

.. _2.6-finalize-shard-cluster-upgrade:

Complete Sharded Cluster Upgrade
````````````````````````````````

After you have successfully upgraded *all* :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances,
you can upgrade the other instances in your MongoDB deployment.

.. warning::

   Do not upgrade :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances until after you have
   upgraded *all* :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

While the balancer is still disabled, upgrade the components of your
sharded cluster in the following order:

- Upgrade all 3 :binary:`~bin.mongod` config server instances, leaving
  the *first* system in the :option:`mongos --configdb` argument to upgrade
  *last*.

- Upgrade each shard, one at a time, upgrading the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  secondaries before running :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` and
  upgrading the primary of each shard.

When this process is complete, :ref:`re-enable the
balancer <sharding-balancing-enable>`.
