Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: analyzeShardKey

   .. versionadded:: 7.0

   Calculates metrics for evaluating a shard key for an unsharded or 
   sharded collection. Metrics are based on sampled queries. You
   can use :dbcommand:`configureQueryAnalyzer` to configure query
   sampling on a collection.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

``analyzeShardKey`` has this syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   db.collection.analyzeShardKey(
      <shardKey>,
      {
        keyCharacteristics: <bool>,
        readWriteDistribution: <bool>,
        sampleRate: <double>,
        sampleSize: <int>
      }
    )

Access Control
--------------

|analyzeShardKey| requires one of these roles:

- :authaction:`enableSharding` privilege action against the collection 
  being analyzed.
- :authrole:`clusterManager` role against the cluster.

.. note::

   Before you run ``analyzeShardKey`` commands, read the
   :ref:`supporting-indexes-ref` section earlier on this page. If you
   require supporting indexes for the shard key you are analyzing, use
   the :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` method to create the
   indexes.
