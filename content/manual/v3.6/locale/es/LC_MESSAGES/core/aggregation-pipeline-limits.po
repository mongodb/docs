msgid ""
"The :dbcommand:`aggregate` command can return either a cursor or store "
"the results in a collection. When returning a cursor or storing the "
"results in a collection, each document in the result set is subject to "
"the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit, currently 16 megabytes; if any "
"single document that exceeds the :limit:`BSON Document Size` limit, the "
"command will produce an error. The limit only applies to the returned "
"documents; during the pipeline processing, the documents may exceed this "
"size. The :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method returns a cursor by "
"default."
