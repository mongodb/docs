This page displays a list of the status of all of the backup jobs and
their blockstores. |onprem| maintains a blockstore using three jobs:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 40 40
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Job Type
     - Description
     - Trigger

   * - Resource Tracking
     - Determines the total number of living and dead bytes in
       blockstores.
     -
       - Runs every three days
       - Runs immediately after a groom job

   * - Groom
     - Moves all blocks of living snapshots to an unused span of disk
       space. This removes any dead blocks that only previously expired
       snapshots used.
     - Runs when the percentage of living block bytes drops
       to drops below a given threshold.

       To learn more, see :ref:`Grooms <grooms-page>`.

   * - Integrity Check
     - Verify that the blockstore has no data integrity issues.
     - Runs every seven days

Each blockstore job runs unless a previously scheduled snapshot
store job remains in progress.

Each blockstore can run only one job at a time unless you change
its :ref:`Load Factor <edit-blockstore>`. The
:guilabel:`Load Factor` sets how many jobs that a blockstore can
run at the same time. Set to ``1`` by default.

.. seealso::

   To learn how to change the :guilabel:`Load Factor`, see
   :ref:`Edit a Blockstore <edit-blockstore>`.

Each row in this table lists a backup job. The background color of the
row indicates the state of its associated blockstore.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Color
     - Storage Usage Status

   * - Blue
     - Changing. |onprem| is grooming this blockstore.

   * - Green
     - Accurate. |onprem| ran a tracking job since last groom job ran.

   * - Red
     - Stale. |onprem| ran a groom job since its last tracking job ran.

Manual Blockstore Maintenance
-----------------------------

|onprem| runs the Resource Tracking, Groom and Integrity Check jobs at
regular intervals. You can start a Groom or Integrity Check job. You
can't start a Resource Tracking job. A Resource Tracking job runs
immediately after a Groom job.

.. _move-blocks-to-new-blockstore:

Move Blocks to a Different Blockstore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To move a backup job's blocks to a different blockstore:

1. Find the blockstore :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` you want to groom in the
   table.

2. Select a different destination blockstore in the backup job's
   :guilabel:`Destination blockstore` column.

3. In the :guilabel:`Groom Action` column, click :guilabel:`Schedule`.

You might want to do this if you add a new blockstore and would like to
balance data. This removes all dead blocks from the backup job. This
groom job is called an
:ref:`inter-blockstore groom job <inter-blockstore-groom-job>`.

Groom a Blockstore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To initiate a groom job:

1. Find the blockstore :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` you want to groom in the
   table.

2. In the :guilabel:`Groom Action` column, click :guilabel:`Schedule`.

You should not need to manually schedule groom jobs. |onprem|
:ref:`runs the jobs automatically <grooms-page>`.

Check Blockstore Integrity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To initiate an integrity check:

1. Find the blockstore :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` you want to groom in the
   table.

2. In :guilabel:`Integrity Action` column, click
   :guilabel:`IntegCheck`.

   |onprem| displays the :guilabel:`Integrity Schedule Result` modal
   with the status of the blockstore.
