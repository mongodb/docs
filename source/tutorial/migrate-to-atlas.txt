Overview
--------

To live migrate data from the |mms|-monitored deployments to
clusters in |service-short|, you:

1. Add your deployment to |mms| if you haven't already done so.
#. Add credentials to Monitoring.
#. Prepare a cluster in |service|.
#. Provision a migration host in |mms| and connect |mms| to |service-short|.
#. Start the live migration process in |service-short|.

You begin the process in |service-short|, by running the live migration wizard.
Depending on the stage in the process, you perform the live migration steps either
in |service-short| or in |mms|. See :ref:`lm-workflow`. 

To live migrate your MongoDB Community deployments to 
|service-short| using |mms|, see :ref:`migrate-community-to-atlas`.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

The list of supported platforms depends on which type of live migration
you are using:

- For live migrations of MongoDB {+c2c-version+}+ or {+c2c-version-7+}+
  clusters monitored by |cloud-short| to |service-short|, see `mongosync platforms <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/installation>`__ to review
  the list of supported platforms for the migration host.

- For live migrations of source clusters running MongoDB versions before
  {+c2c-version+}, the legacy live migration to |service-short|
  :ref:`is supported <live-migration-host-supported-platforms>` for all
  platforms on which you can provision a migration host.

  Provisioning of the migration host is not supported on Windows or macOS.
  You can still live migrate your data from a Windows-based deployment
  to |service-short| if you provision your migration host on one of its
  supported platforms. You can't live migrate your data from a macOS-based
  deployment to |service-short|.

.. _lm-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin the live migration process, follow these prerequisites.

Add Your Deployment to |mms|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the procedure to :ref:`add-existing-mongodb-hosts`. 

Add Credentials for Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you add your  deployment to |mms|, you need to add credentials for Monitoring only,  not for Automation or Backup. Adding your deployment for
Monitoring  imports your deployment's metadata into |mms| to help with the live migration process. It doesn't import your deployment's actual data. To
learn more about authentication credentials, see :ref:`add-existing-mongodb-processes-auth`.

To add credentials for :ref:`Monitoring <monitoring-functional-overview>`:

1. Create the credentials to the deployment. See 
   :ref:`Required Access for Monitoring <mms-req-cred-monitoring>`.
#. Add the credentials based on your project's authentication mechanism. 
   See :ref:`add-auth-credentials-imported-deployment`. 

.. note::

   If you're adding your MongoDB deployment to monitoring so that you can live migrate it to |service-short|, you don't need to add credentials for 
   Automation and Backup. To learn more, see :ref:`add-existing-mongodb-processes-auth`.

Consider Configuring a VPC Peering Connection or Private Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For information about support for VPC peering connections and private endpoints,
see the |service| documentation for your type of live migration:

- :atlas:`Live Migrate Your MongoDB {+c2c-version+} or Later Cluster Monitored by Cloud Manager to Atlas </import/c2c-push-live-migration/>`
- :atlas:`Live Migrate Your Data from Cloud Manager </migration-from-com>`

.. important::

   Sharded clusters, multi-region clusters, and multi-cloud
   clusters don't support live migration through private endpoints.
   Private endpoints are supported ONLY for live migration of replica sets
   deployed within a single cloud provider and single region.

.. _lm-create-atlas-cluster:

Create a Cluster in Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perform these tasks in |service-short|:

- :atlas:`Create an Atlas account </tutorial/create-atlas-account>`.
- :atlas:`Create an Atlas organization </tutorial/manage-organizations/#std-label-create-organization>`.
- :atlas:`Create a project </tutorial/manage-projects/#std-label-create-project>`
  in this organization.
- :atlas:`Create a new cluster </tutorial/create-new-cluster>`
  in your project.

.. _lm-workflow:

Workflow for Live Migration
---------------------------

The stages in the live migration workflow are:

- **Stage 1: Link with Atlas**. Perform this step in |service-short|,
  after :ref:`provisioning a cluster <lm-create-atlas-cluster>`.

  a. In the left-side panel of your organization's page in |service|,
     click :guilabel:`Live Migration`.
  #. Select :guilabel:`Migrate from Ops Manager or Cloud Manager` and start
     the live migration wizard. Even though the UI mentions |onprem|,
     depending on the type of the source cluster you are migrating to |service-short|,
     only |cloud-short| is supported with that source cluster. Specifically,
     for source clusters running {+c2c-version+}+ or {+c2c-version-7+}+,
     you can monitor them in |cloud-short| only but not in |onprem|.
  #. In the :guilabel:`Generate Link-Token` step of the wizard, create
     the link-token. You will use this link-token in the next stage.

- **Stage 2: Provision Migration Host**.
  
  - In |mms|, :doc:`provision a Migration Host </tutorial/provision-migration-host>`.
    A migration host is a dedicated {+mdbagent+} that orchestrates the
    live migration process from |mms| to |service-short|.

  - .. include:: /includes/nav/list-org-settings.rst
    
    #. Select :ref:`Connect to Atlas <connect-to-atlas-lm>` and enter 
       the link-token that you created in |service-short|.

- **Stage 3: Start the Migration**. In |service-short|, follow the
  steps in the wizard to start the live migration process.
