Standard Connection String Format
---------------------------------

This section describes the standard format of the MongoDB connection URI
used to connect to a MongoDB database server. The format is the same for
all official MongoDB drivers. For a list of drivers and links to driver
documentation, see :doc:`/applications/drivers`.

The following is the standard URI connection scheme:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]

The components of this string are:

#. ``mongodb://``

   A required prefix to identify that this is a string in the standard
   connection format.

#. ``username:password@``

   Optional. If specified, the client will attempt to log in to the
   specific database using these credentials after connecting to the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

#. ``host1``

   This the only required part of the URI. It identifies a server
   address to connect to. It identifies either a hostname, IP address,
   or UNIX domain socket.

#. ``:port1``

   Optional. The default value is ``:27017`` if not specified.

#. ``hostX``

   Optional. You can specify as many hosts as necessary. You would
   specify multiple hosts, for example, for connections to replica
   sets.

#. ``:portX``

   Optional. The default value is ``:27017`` if not specified.

#. ``/database``

   Optional. The name of the database to authenticate if the
   connection string includes authentication credentials in the form
   of ``username:password@``. If ``/database`` is not specified and
   the connection string includes credentials, the driver will
   authenticate to the ``admin`` database.

#. ``?options``

   Connection specific options. See
   :ref:`connections-connection-options` for a full description of
   these options.

   If the connection string does not specify a database/ you must
   specify a slash (i.e.  ``/``) between the last ``hostN`` and the
   question mark that begins the string of options.

.. example:: To describe a connection to a replica set named ``test``,
   with the following :binary:`~bin.mongod` hosts:

   - ``db1.example.net`` on port ``27017`` and
   - ``db2.example.net`` on port ``2500``.

   You would use a connection string that resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: none

      mongodb://db1.example.net,db2.example.net:2500/?replicaSet=test

.. index:: connections; options
.. _connections-connection-options:

Connection String Options
-------------------------

This section lists all connection options used in the
:ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format`.The options are
not case-sensitive.

Connection options are pairs in the following form:
``name=value``. Separate options with the ampersand (i.e. ``&``)
character. In the following example, a connection uses the
``replicaSet`` and ``connectTimeoutMS`` options:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://db1.example.net,db2.example.net:2500/?replicaSet=test&connectTimeoutMS=300000

.. admonition:: Semi-colon separator for connection string arguments

   To provide backwards compatibility, drivers currently accept
   semi-colons (i.e. ``;``) as option separators.

.. _replica-set-options:
.. _replica-set-option:

Replica Set Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: uri.replicaSet

   Specifies the name of the :term:`replica set`, if the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` is a member of a replica set.

   When connecting to a replica set it is important to give a seed
   list of at least two :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. If you only
   provide the connection point of a single :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instance, and omit the :data:`~uri.replicaSet`, the client will create a
   :term:`standalone` connection.

Connection Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: uri.ssl

   ``true``: Initiate the connection with SSL.

   ``false``: Initiate the connection without SSL.

   .. todo Determine whether ``prefer`` option exists. Check with server
      team whether it's possible to do rolling restarts of a cluster to
      turn on SSL. Here is the option
      ``prefer``: Initiate the connection with SSL, but if that fails initiate without SSL.

   The default value is ``false``.

   .. note:: The :data:`~uri.ssl` option is not supported by all
      drivers. See your :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>`
      documentation and the :doc:`/administration/ssl` document.

.. data:: uri.connectTimeoutMS

   The time in milliseconds to attempt a connection before timing out.
   The default is never to timeout, though different drivers might
   vary.  See the :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>` documentation.

.. data:: uri.socketTimeoutMS

   The time in milliseconds to attempt a send or receive on a socket
   before the attempt times out. The default is never to timeout,
   though different drivers might vary. See the :doc:`driver
   </applications/drivers>` documentation.

Connection Pool Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most drivers implement some kind of connection pooling handle this for
you behind the scenes. Some drivers do not support connection
pools. See your :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>` documentation
for more information on the connection pooling implementation. These
options allow applications to configure the connection pool when
connecting to the MongoDB deployment.

.. data:: uri.maxPoolSize

   The maximum number of connections in the connection pool. The default
   value is ``100``.

.. data:: uri.minPoolSize

   The minimum number of connections in the connection pool. The default
   value is ``0``.

   .. note:: The :data:`~uri.minPoolSize` option is not supported by all
      drivers. For information on your driver, see the :doc:`drivers
      </applications/drivers>` documentation.

.. data:: uri.maxIdleTimeMS

   The maximum number of milliseconds that a connection can remain
   idle in the pool before being removed and closed.

   This option is not supported by all drivers.

.. data:: uri.waitQueueMultiple

   A number that the driver multiples the :data:`~uri.maxPoolSize` value
   to, to provide the maximum number of threads allowed to wait for a
   connection to become available from the pool. For default values,
   see the :doc:`/applications/drivers` documentation.

.. data:: uri.waitQueueTimeoutMS

   The maximum time in milliseconds that a thread can wait for a
   connection to become available. For default values, see the
   :doc:`/applications/drivers` documentation.

.. _connections-write-concern:

Write Concern Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Write concern <write-concern>` describes the kind of assurances
that the program:`mongod` and the driver provide to the application
regarding the success and durability of the write operation. For a
full explanation of write concern and write operations in general see
the: :doc:`/core/write-operations`:

.. data:: uri.w

   Defines the level and kind of write concern, that the driver uses
   when calling :dbcommand:`getLastError`. This option can take either
   a number or a string as a value.

   :option -1:

      The driver will *not* acknowledge write operations and will
      suppress all network or socket errors.

   :option 0:

      The driver will *not* acknowledge write operations, but will
      pass or handle any network and socket errors that it receives to
      the client.

      If you disable write concern but enable the
      :dbcommand:`getLastError` command's ``journal`` option,
      ``journal`` overrides this ``w`` option.

   :option 1:

      Provides basic acknowledgment of write operations.

      By specifying ``1``, you require that a standalone
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, or the primary for :term:`replica
      sets <replica set>`, acknowledge all write operations. For drivers released
      after the :doc:`default write concern change
      </release-notes/drivers-write-concern>`, this is the default
      write concern setting.

   :option string majority:

      For replica sets, if you specify the special ``majority`` value
      to :data:`~uri.w` option, write operations will only return
      successfully after a majority of the configured replica set
      members have acknowledged the write operation.

   :option number n:

      For replica sets, if you specify a number greater than 1,
      operations with this write concern will only return after this
      many members of the set have acknowledged the write.

      If you set ``w`` to a number that is greater than the number of
      available set members, or members that hold data, MongoDB will
      wait, potentially indefinitely, for these members to become
      available.

   :option string tags:

      For replica sets, you can specify a :ref:`tag set <replica-set-configuration-tag-sets>` to require
      that all members of the set that have these tags configured
      return confirmation of the write operation.

      See :ref:`Replica Set Tag Set Configuration
      <replica-set-configuration-tag-sets>` for more information.

.. data:: uri.wtimeoutMS

   The time in milliseconds to wait for replication to succeed, as
   specified in the :data:`~uri.w` option, before timing out.

.. data:: uri.journal

   Controls whether write operations will wait till the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` acknowledges the write operations and commits the
   data to the on disk :term:`journal`.

   :option boolean true:

      Enables journal commit acknowledgment write concern. Equivalent
      to specifying the :dbcommand:`getLastError` command with the
      ``j`` option enabled.

   :option boolean false:

      Does not require that :binary:`~bin.mongod` commit write operations
      to the journal before acknowledging the write operation. This
      is the *default* option for the :data:`~uri.journal` parameter.

    If you set :data:`~uri.journal` to ``true``, and specify a :data:`~uri.w`
    value less than 1, :data:`~uri.journal` prevails.

    If you set :data:`~uri.journal` to true, and the :binary:`~bin.mongod` does
    not have journaling enabled, as with :setting:`nojournal`, then
    :dbcommand:`getLastError` will provide basic receipt
    acknowledgment (i.e. ``w:1``), and will include a ``jnote`` field
    in its return document.

Read Preference Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Read preferences <replica-set-read-preference>` describe the
behavior of read operations with regards to :term:`replica sets
<replica set>`. These parameters allow you to specify read preferences
on a per-connection basis in the connection string:

.. data:: uri.readPreference

   Specifies the :term:`replica set` read preference for this
   connection. This setting overrides any ``slaveOk`` value. The read
   preference values are the following:

   - :readmode:`primary`
   - :readmode:`primaryPreferred`
   - :readmode:`secondary`
   - :readmode:`secondaryPreferred`
   - :readmode:`nearest`

   For descriptions of each value, see
   :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-modes`.

   The default value is :readmode:`primary`, which sends all read
   operations to the replica set's :term:`primary`.

.. data:: uri.readPreferenceTags

   Specifies a tag set as a comma-separated list of
   colon-separated key-value pairs. For example:

   .. code-block:: none

      dc:ny,rack:1

   To specify a *list* of tag sets, use multiple ``readPreferenceTags``.
   The following specifies two tag sets and an empty tag set:

   .. code-block:: none

      readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:1&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny&readPreferenceTags=

   Order matters when using multiple ``readPreferenceTags``.

Miscellaneous Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: uri.uuidRepresentation

   :param standard:
          The standard binary representation.

   :param csharpLegacy:
          The default representation for the C# driver.

   :param javaLegacy:
          The default representation for the Java driver.

   :param pythonLegacy:
          The default representation for the Python driver.

   For the default, see the :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>`
   documentation for your driver.

   .. note:: Not all drivers support the :data:`~uri.uuidRepresentation`
      option. For information on your driver, see the :doc:`drivers
      </applications/drivers>` documentation.

Examples
--------

Consider the following example MongoDB URI strings, that specify
common connections:

- Connect to a database server running locally on the default port:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://localhost

- Connect and log in to the ``admin`` database as user ``sysop`` with
  the password ``moon``:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://sysop:moon@localhost

- Connect and log in to the ``records`` database as user ``sysop`` with
  the password ``moon``:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://sysop:moon@localhost/records

- Connect to a UNIX domain socket:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb:///tmp/mongodb-27017.sock

  .. note:: Not all drivers support UNIX domain sockets. For information
     on your driver, see the :doc:`drivers </applications/drivers>`
     documentation.

- Connect to a :term:`replica set` with two members, one on
  ``db1.example.net`` and the other on ``db2.example.net``:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://db1.example.net,db2.example.com

- Connect to a replica set with three members running on ``localhost``, on
  ports ``27017``, ``27018``, and ``27019``:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://localhost,localhost:27018,localhost:27019

- Connect to a replica set with three members. Send all writes to the
  :term:`primary` and distribute reads to the :term:`secondaries <secondary>`:

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://example1.com,example2.com,example3.com/?readPreference=secondary

- Connect to a replica set with write concern configured to wait for
  replication to succeed on at least two members, with a two-second
  timeout.

  .. code-block:: none

     mongodb://example1.com,example2.com,example3.com/?w=2&wtimeoutMS=2000
