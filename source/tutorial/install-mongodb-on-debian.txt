Install MongoDB on Debian
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

This tutorial outlines the basic installation process for installing
:term:`MongoDB` on Debian systems. This tutorial uses
``.deb`` packages as the basis of the installation. 10gen publishes
packages of the MongoDB releases as ``.deb`` packages for easy
installation and management for users of Debian systems. While some of
these distributions include their own MongoDB packages, the 10gen
packages are generally more up to date.

This tutorial includes: an overview of the available packages,
instructions for configuring the package manager, the process
for installing packages from the 10gen repository, and preliminary MongoDB
configuration and operation.

.. note:: 

   If you're running a version of Ubuntu Linux prior to 9.10 "Karmic,"
   use this tutorial. Other Ubuntu users will want to follow
   the :doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu` tutorial.

.. seealso:: The documentation of following related processes and
   concepts.

Package Options
---------------

The 10gen repository contains three packages:

- ``mongodb-10gen``

  This package contains the latest **stable** release. Use this for
  production deployments.

- ``mongodb20-10gen``

  This package contains the stable release of v2.0 branch.

- ``mongodb18-10gen``

  This package contains the stable release of v1.8 branch.

You cannot install these packages concurrently with each other or with
the ``mongodb`` package that your release of Debian may include.

10gen also provides packages for "unstable" or development versions of
MongoDB. Use the ``mongodb-10gen-unstable`` package to test the latest
development release of MongoDB, but do not use this version in
production.

Installing MongoDB
------------------

Configure Package Management System (APT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Debian package management tool (i.e. ``dpkg`` and ``apt``) ensure
package consistency and authenticity by requiring that distributors
sign packages with GPG keys. Issue the following command to import the
`10gen public GPG Key <http://docs.mongodb.org/10gen-gpg-key.asc>`_:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 7F0CEB10

Create a the ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/10gen.list`` file and include
the following line for the 10gen repository.

.. code-block:: sources.list

   deb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/debian-sysvinit dist 10gen

Now issue the following command to reload your repository:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt-get update

Install Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the following command to install the latest stable version of
MongoDB:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt-get install mongodb-10gen

When this command completes, you have successfully installed MongoDB!
Continue for configuration and start-up suggestions.

Configure MongoDB
-----------------

These packages configure MongoDB using the ``/etc/mongodb.conf`` file
in conjunction with the :term:`control script`.  You can find the
control script at ``/etc/init.d/mongodb``.

This MongoDB instance will store its data files in the
``/var/lib/mongodb`` and its log files in ``/var/log/mongodb``, and
run using the ``mongodb`` user account.

.. note::

   If you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you will need
   to modify the access control rights to the ``/var/lib/mongodb`` and
   ``/var/log/mongodb`` directories.

Controlling MongoDB
-------------------

Starting MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the following command to start :program:`mongod`:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb start

You can verify that :program:`mongod` has started successfully by checking the
contents of the log file at ``/var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log``.

Stopping MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the following command to stop :program:`mongod`:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb stop

Restarting MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the following command to restart :program:`mongod`:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb restart

Controlling :program:`mongos`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of the current release, there are no :term:`control scripts
<control script>` for :program:`mongos`. :program:`mongos` is only
used in sharding deployments and typically do not run on the same
systems where :program:`mongod` runs. You can use the ``mongodb``
script referenced above to derive your own :program:`mongos` control
script.

Using MongoDB
-------------

Among the tools included with the MongoDB package, is the
:program:`mongo` shell. You can connect to your MongoDB instance by
issuing the following command at the system prompt:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo

This will connect to the database running on the localhost interface
by default. At the :program:`mongo` prompt, issue the following two
commands to insert a record in the "test" :term:`collection` of the
(default) "test" database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   > db.test.save( { a: 1 } )
   > db.test.find()

.. seealso:: ":program:`mongo`" and ":doc:`/reference/javascript`"
