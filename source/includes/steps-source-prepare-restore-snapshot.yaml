     * - Restore Type

       - Description

       - Action

     * - :guilabel:`Snapshot`

       - Allows you to choose one :term:`stored snapshot <snapshot>`.

       - Select an existing :term:`snapshot <snapshot>` to restore.

     * - :guilabel:`Point In Time`

       - Creates a custom snapshot that includes all operations up to
         but not including the selected time.

         .. example::

            If you select ``12:00``, the last operation in the restore
            is ``11:59:59`` or earlier.

         .. important::
            You cannot perform a PIT restore that covers any time prior
            to the latest backup resync. For the conditions that cause
            a resync, see :doc:`/tutorial/resync-backup`.

       - Select a :guilabel:`Date` and :guilabel:`Time`.

     * - :guilabel:`Oplog Timestamp`

       - Creates a custom snapshot based on the timestamp of an 
         :term:`oplog` entry (its ``ts`` field). |mms| includes all 
         operations up to *and including* the time of the timestamp.

         The oplog entry's ``ts`` field is a 
         :manual:`BSON </reference/bson-types>` timestamp and has two 
         components: the timestamp and the increment.

       -  
         Type the following:

         :guilabel:`Timestamp`
           The value in seconds since the Unix epoch.

         :guilabel:`Increment`
           An incrementing ordinal for operations within a given
           second.

  Click :guilabel:`Next`.
