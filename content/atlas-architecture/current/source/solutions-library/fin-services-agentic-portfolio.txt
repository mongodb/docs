Solution Overview  
-----------------  
  
In today’s capital markets, effective risk management is rapidly
evolving as data becomes central to strategic decision-making. Portfolio
managers must navigate massive volumes of diverse data. This data can be
structured, such as financial feeds, or unstructured, like social media
posts. This diversity of data poses challenges to traditional systems
that aren't built to handle it. AI-driven solutions are redefining
portfolio management by integrating adaptive, context-aware
decision-making.

Our intelligent investment portfolio integrates and analyzes varied data
sources. By combining real-time analysis with generative AI models,
this solution transforms how portfolio managers explore insights
and take action.

Powered by large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), and MongoDB Atlas, including Vector Search, Time Series
collections, and Atlas Charts, this solution empowers AI agents to:

- Analyze vast financial datasets from multiple sources. 
- Process data into meaningful analytics. 
- Provide dynamic insights and recommendations based on portfolio performance.

This enhances decision-making, improves risk management,
and enables more accurate performance and impact analysis,
helping portfolio managers make smarter and faster decisions
with more data.
  
Reference Architectures  
-----------------------  
  
This investment portfolio manager demo is composed of four types of
agents:

- Analysis agents 
- News agents
- Social media agents
- Assistant agents

This demo includes one of these agents each for conventional assets, and
one for crypto assets, resulting in a total of eight agents.
Additionally, there are two micro-service applications. The first, the
Data Ingestion Application, ingests, transforms, and prepares financial,
macroeconomic, news, and social media data from multiple sources. The
second, the Insight Application, orchestrates AI agent workflows to
analyze this data, monitor trends, assess sentiment, and generate
targeted investment insights. As seen in the diagram below:

.. figure:: /includes/images/industry-solutions/fin-services-high-level-arch.svg
   :alt: Reference architecture of the agentic ai-powered investment portfolio manager 

   Figure 1. High-level architecture 

As shown in the diagram, MongoDB stores the data collected in the
ingestion process. This data includes the following types:

- Time series data, such as conventional and cryptocurrency asset data.
- Structured data, such as macroeconomic indicators and stablecoin market cap data.
- Unstructured data, such as financial news articles and social media posts.

The solution then analyzes the sentiment score of the news articles and
social media data, creates the corresponding embeddings, and stores them
in their respective collections in MongoDB Atlas. 

The analysis, news, and social media agents take the data from MongoDB
to analyze and generate reports for conventional and crypto market
assets.  

Finally, the market and crypto assistant agents, power
portfolio-specific insights based on current portfolio allocation, and
provide portfolio management recommendations for both types of assets
using a LangGraph ReAct agent, leveraging MongoDB Atlas for data
storage, vector search, and agent state management.

Additionally, this solution includes a demonstration application that
highlights the advanced capabilities of the MongoDB Model Context
Protocol (MCP) Server when integrated with an AI-powered ReAct Agent.
This application efficiently processes complex financial data queries
stored within MongoDB Atlas, utilizing an intuitive interface for
AI-driven interactions. 

This approach eliminates the need for manual
querying and direct database engagement, providing a clear illustration
of how this integration enables effortless data exploration and
streamlined database management, ultimately contributing to smarter,
faster, and more informed investment decisions.


Build the Solution  
-------------------  
  
The demo is composed of four microservices, each with its own GitHub repository:

1. `Loaders Service <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/leafy-bank-backend-capitalmarkets-loaders>`__
#. `Agents Service <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/leafy-bank-backend-capitalmarkets-agents>`__
#. `Market Assistant ReAct Agent Service <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/leafy-bank-backend-capitalmarkets-react-agent-chatbot>`__ and `Crypto Assistant ReAct Agent Service <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/leafy-bank-backend-capitalmarkets-react-agent-crypto>`__ 
#. `MCP Server and MongoDB Interaction <https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/leafy-bank-capitalmarkets-mcp>`__ 

1. Loaders Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /includes/images/industry-solutions/fin-services-Loaders-arch.svg
   :alt: Loaders Service Architecture   

   Figure 2. Loaders service architecture 

First, the solution stores the data in MongoDB Atlas. It does this
through the data ingestion application, a set of scheduled work that
handles the extraction of data from the following sources:

- **Yahoo News**: Financial news about conventional and crypto assets.
- **Yahoo Finance**: Time-series conventional assets data. 
- **FRED API**: Macroeconomic indicators data. 
- **Reddit**: Social media news about conventional and crypto assets.
- **Binance**: Cryptocurrency market data.  
- **CoinGecko**: Stablecoin market caps data.
- **Portfolio performance**: designed to generate simulated portfolio performance data.

After the data is stored in MongoDB collections, the unstructured
news and social media data is processed to calculate its sentiment
score using FinBERT, a pre-trained LLM model. Next, you vectorize the
data with Voyage AI's embedding model, ``voyage-finance-2``, and
store it in its corresponding MongoDB collection along with its
vector embeddings.

Here's how MongoDB can store different types of data:

2. Agents Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /includes/images/industry-solutions/fin-services-agents-arch.svg
   :alt: Agents Service Architecture   

   Figure 3. Agents service architecture  

While the data is stored in MongoDB, it still needs to be processed.
The agents described in the following sections process the data to
generate portfolio-specific insights.

**Analysis Agents**

These agents search for the relevant MongoDB collections related to
market and crypto data and analyze asset trends and macroeconomic
indicators in each collection. They then perform a series of
calculations to generate portfolio insights and recommendations.

These calculations form the analytical backbone for data-driven
decision-making. They assess economic indicators and volatility
measures for traditional assets to capture macroeconomic influences,
while tracking price trends, trading activity, and momentum
indicators for crypto assets. Together, they enable AI agents to
continuously monitor markets, balance risk, and optimize portfolio
performance in real time.

Market asset calculations: 

- VIX Sensitivity Analysis
- GDP Analysis 
- Interest Rate Analysis 
- Unemployment Rate Analysis

Crypto asset calculations:

- Moving Average Analysis
- Volume Analysis
- RSI Analysis
- VWAP Analysis

The calculations are then combined with LLM-based reasoning, such as
AWS Bedrock or Anthropic, to produce tailored portfolio
recommendations.

**News Agents**

These agents use MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to retrieve
semantically-relevant financial news for traditional and crypto
assets. Then, they perform LLM-based sentiment analysis and
summarization to highlight key signals.

**Social Media Agents**

Similarly to the news agents, the social media agents retrieve
semantically-relevant social media posts using MongoDB Atlas Vector
Search. Finally, they aggregate the LLM-based sentiment analysis and
summarization into the corresponding ``reports`` collection.

To replicate this microservice, see its `GitHub repository: Scheduled
Agents Service
<https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/leafy-bank-backend-capitalmarkets-agents>`__

3. Market and Crypto Assistant Agent Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /includes/images/industry-solutions/fin-services-reAct-chatbot-arch.svg
   :alt: Market Assistant Agent Service Architecture   

   Figure 4. Market / Crypto assistant agent service architecture  

Once the reports are generated and stored into MongoDB Atlas
collections, the Market Assistant Agent uses the ReAct reasoning
pattern, implemented through LangGraph, to autonomously interpret
user queries, access relevant tools, and generate actionable
financial insights.

These agents function as structured LLM-powered financial
advisors, capable of step-by-step reasoning, action execution, and
memory retention. Built with LangGraph’s ReAct agent framework, they
follow this cycle:

1. Reason about the query 
#. Act, such as use a tool
#. Observe the result 
#. Iteratively continue until a final response is reached

Agent behavior is defined via a customizable agent profile stored in
MongoDB, while long-term memory and state persistence are managed
using the `MongoDB checkpointer
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/ai-integrations/langgraph/#std-label-langgraph>`__,
which tracks interaction steps, storing them into the collections:
``checkpoints_aio`` and ``checkpoint_writes_aio``.

To replicate this microservice, see its `GitHub repositories: Market Assistant ReAct Agent Chatbot Service
<https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/leafy-bank-backend-capitalmarkets-react-agent-chatbot>`__
and/or `Crypto Assistant ReAct Agent Chatbot Service
<https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/leafy-bank-backend-capitalmarkets-react-agent-crypto>`__

As shown in the previous diagrams, the agents are LLM-powered,
tool-augmented workflows, orchestrated using LangGraph. Each
follows a structured, deterministic process where tools are
invoked in a fixed sequence, ensuring reliable and explainable
execution. 

**Agent Tools**

Tools give agents the ability to retrieve data, call APIs, run code,
query databases, or trigger business logic, turning them from passive
responders into active problem-solvers. In this solution, are
classified into the following:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Data Retrieval
      :tabid: data-retrieval

      ``check_portfolio_allocation_tool``: Retrieves portfolio allocation data from MongoDB collections.
      
      ``assess_macro_indicators_tool``: Retrieves macroeconomic indicators from FRED API data.
      
      ``assess_vix_tool``: Retrieves VIX market-volatility data from financial datasets.

   .. tab:: Vector Search
      :tabid: vector-search

      ``fetch_market_news_tool``: Performs vector search on financial news articles using embeddings.
      
      ``fetch_social_media_submissions_tool``: Performs vector search on Reddit submissions using embeddings.
   
   .. tab:: Aggregations
      :tabid: aggregations

      ``calculate_crypto_trends_tool``: Aggregates crypto price data to calculate moving averages and trends.
      
      ``calculate_asset_trends_tool``: Aggregates traditional asset price data for trend analysis.
      
      ``calculate_crypto_momentum_indicators_tool``: Aggregates crypto data to compute RSI, volume patterns, and VWAP.
      
      ``calculate_news_sentiment_tool``: Aggregates sentiment scores from news articles by asset.
      
      ``calculate_social_media_sentiment_tool``: Aggregates sentiment scores from social media submissions by asset.
      
      ``generate_news_sentiment_summary_tool``: Aggregates news sentiment data and generates LLM-powered summaries.
      
      ``generate_social_media_sentiment_summary_tool``: Aggregates social media sentiment data and generates LLM-powered summaries.
      
      ``generate_overall_diagnosis_tool``: Aggregates all analysis results with risk profiles for final portfolio diagnosis.
      
      ``generate_overall_diagnosis_tool`` (crypto version): Aggregates crypto analysis results for comprehensive portfolio diagnosis.

4. MCP Server and MongoDB Interaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This solution's final feature combines the MongoDB MCP Server
and an AI-powered ReAct Agent that enables real-time natural
language queries on financial data stored in MongoDB Atlas.

By combining MCP servers and MongoDB you can explore your
data through natural language, perform database administration 
tasks, and generate context-aware code.
