Changes
-------

Major Features
++++++++++++++

.. _2.4-release-text-indexes:

Text Search
~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.4 adds support for boolean search of content in MongoDB
databases as a beta feature. With the new :ref:`text index
<index-feature-text>`, and supporting, :dbcommand:`text` command you
can search text in data stored in MongoDB, using an index that updates
in real-time and is always consistent with the data set. See
:doc:`/core/text-search` for more information about text
search in MongoDB.

.. _2.4-release-geospatial:

New Geospatial Indexes with GeoJSON and Improved Spherical Geometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB adds the new ``2dsphere`` geospatial index in addition to the
existing ``2d`` index. The ``2dsphere`` index supports improved
spherical queries and supports the following `GeoJSON
<http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html>`_ objects:

- ``Point``

- ``LineString``

- ``Polygon``

The ``2dsphere`` index supports all current geospatial :doc:`query
operators </reference/operator/query-geospatial>` and introduces the following new
query operator for queries on GeoJSON data:

- :operator:`$geoWithin` operator

- :operator:`$geoIntersects` operator

The operators use the new :operator:`$geometry` parameter.

The :operator:`$within` operator no longer requires a geospatial
index.  Additionally, 2.4 deprecates the :operator:`$within`
operator. Use :operator:`$geoWithin` operator instead.

For more information on geospatial indexes in 2.4, see:

- :doc:`/applications/geospatial-indexes`

- :doc:`/core/geospatial-indexes`

.. _2.4-release-hashed-indexes:

New Hashed Index and Sharding with a Hashed Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support an easy to configure and evenly distributed shard key,
version 2.4 adds a new "``hashed``" index type that indexes documents
using hashes of field values.

See :ref:`index-type-hashed` for documentation of ``hashed`` indexes,
and :ref:`sharding-hashed-sharding` for documentation of hash-based
sharding.

Security Improvements
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. _kerberos-authentication:

New Modular Authentication System with Support for Kerberos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Kerberos authentication is only present in `MongoDB Enterprise
   Edition <http://www.10gen.com/products/mongodb-enterprise>`_.  To
   download and install MongoDB Enterprise, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise`.


In 2.4 the MongoDB Enterprise now supports authentication via a
Kerberos mechanism. See
:doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication`
for more information.

Also consider the following documents that address authenticating to
MongoDB using Kerberos:

- :ecosystem:`Authenticate to MongoDB using Kerberos and the Java
  Driver </tutorial/authenticate-with-java-driver/>`

- :ecosystem:`Authenticate to MongoDB using Kerberos and the C# Driver
  </tutorial/authenticate-with-csharp-driver/>`

.. see:: :doc:`MongoDB Security Practices and Procedures </security>`.

Role Based Access Control and New Privilege Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.4 introduces a role based access control system that
provides more granular privileges to MongoDB users. See
:doc:`/reference/user-privileges` for more information.

To support the new access control system, 2.4 also introduces a new
format for documents in a database's
:data:`system.users <<database>.system.users>` collection. See
:doc:`/reference/privilege-documents` for more information.

Use :parameter:`supportCompatibilityFormPrivilegeDocuments` to disable
the legacy privilege documents, which MongoDB continues to support in
2.4.

Enhanced SSL Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 2.4, MongoDB instances can optionally require clients to provide SSL
certificates signed by a Certificate Authority. You must use the
MongoDB distribution that supports SSL, and your client driver must
support SSL. See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for more
information.


.. _2.4-unique-users:

Compatibility Change: User Uniqueness Enforced
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2.4 now enforces uniqueness of the ``user`` field in user privilege
documents (i.e. in the :data:`system.users <<database>.system.users>`
collection.) Previous versions of MongoDB did not enforce this
requirement, and existing databases may have duplicates.

Administration Changes
++++++++++++++++++++++

``--setParameter`` Option Available on the ``mongos`` and ``mongod`` Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can now use :option:`--setParameter <mongod --setParameter>` on
the command line and :setting:`setParameter` in the configuration
file.  For :program:`mongod` the following options are available using
:setting:`setParameter`:

.. include:: /includes/list-set-parameters-mongod.rst

For :program:`mongos` the following options are available using
:setting:`setParameter`:

.. include:: /includes/list-set-parameters-mongos.rst

See :doc:`/reference/parameters` for full documentation of available
parameters and their use.

.. _2.4-release-server-status:

Changes to ``serverStatus`` Output Including Additional Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 2.4 MongoDB adds a number of counters and system metrics to the
output of the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command, including:

- a :ref:`working set estimator <server-status-workingset>`.

- operation counters, in :data:`~serverStatus.metrics.document`
  and :data:`~serverStatus.metrics.operation`.

- record allocation, in :data:`~serverStatus.metrics.record`.

- thorough metrics of the replication process,
  in :data:`~serverStatus.metrics.repl`.

- metrics on the :doc:`ttl index </tutorial/expire-data>`
  documentation.

Additionally, in 2.4, the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command can
dynamically construct the :doc:`serverStatus </reference/command/serverStatus>` document by excluding
any top-level sections included by default, or including any top-level
section not included by default (e.g. :data:`~serverStatus.workingSet`.)

See :method:`db.serverStatus()` and :dbcommand:`serverStatus` for more
information.

Increased Chunk Migration Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, all insert and delete operations that occur as part of a
:term:`chunk` migration in a :term:`sharded cluster` will have an
increased write concern, to ensure that at least one secondary
acknowledges each insert and deletion operation. This change slows the
potential speed of a chunk migration, but increases reliability and
ensures that a large number of chunk migrations *cannot* affect the
availability of a sharded cluster.

BSON Document Validation Enabled by Default for ``mongod`` and ``mongorestore``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 2.4, MongoDB enables basic :term:`BSON` object validation
for :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongorestore` when writing to
MongoDB data files. This prevents any client from inserting invalid or
malformed BSON into a MongoDB database. For objects with a high degree
of sub-document nesting this validation may have a small performance
impact. :setting:`objcheck`, which was previously disabled by default,
provides this validation.

Indexing Changes
++++++++++++++++

Support for Multiple Concurrent Index Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A single :program:`mongod` instance can build multiple indexes in the
background at the same time. See :ref:`building indexes in the
background <index-creation-background>` for more information on
background index builds. Foreground index builds hold a database lock
and must proceed one at a time.

``db.killOp()`` Can Now Kill Foreground Index Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :method:`db.killOp()` method will now terminate a foreground index
build, in addition to the other operations supported in previous
versions.

Improved Validation of Index Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before 2.4, :program:`mongod` would create an ascending scalar index
(e.g. ``{ a : 1 }``) when users attempted to create an index of a type
that did not exist. Creating an index of an invalid index type
will generate an error in 2.4.

See :doc:`/release-notes/2.4-index-types` for more information.

Interface Changes
+++++++++++++++++

``$setOnInsert`` -- New Update Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Properly restructure this section after adding $push...

To set fields *only* when an :method:`upsert <db.collection.update()>`
performs an insert, use the :operator:`$setOnInsert` operator with the
:method:`upsert <db.collection.update()>` .

.. example::

   A collection named ``coll`` has no documents with ``_id`` equal to
   ``1``.

   The following :method:`upsert <db.collection.update()>` operation
   inserts a document and applies the :operator:`$setOnInsert` operator
   to set the fields ``x`` and ``y``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.coll.update( { _id: 1 },
                      { $setOnInsert: { x: 25, y: 30 } },
                      { upsert: true } )

   The newly-inserted document has the field ``x`` set to ``25`` and
   the field ``y`` set to 30:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id" : 1, "x" : 25, "y" : 30 }

.. note::

   The :operator:`$setOnInsert` operator performs no operation for
   :method:`upserts <db.collection.update()>` that only perform an
   update and for :method:`updates <db.collection.update()>` when the
   ``upsert`` option is ``false``.

.. _2.4-fixed-size-arrays:

Limit Number of Elements in an Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 2.4, by using the :operator:`$push` operator with the
:operator:`$each`, the :operator:`$sort`, and the :operator:`$slice`
modifiers, you can add multiple elements to an array, sort and limit
the number of elements in the modified array to maintain an array with
a fixed number of elements.

See :doc:`/tutorial/limit-number-of-elements-in-updated-array` for an
example where an update maintains the top three scores for a student.

.. seealso::

   The following pages provide additional information and examples:

   - :operator:`$push` operator

   - :operator:`$each` modifier

   - :operator:`$sort` modifier

   - :operator:`$slice` modifier

.. _2.4-release-javascript-change:

JavaScript Engine Changed to V8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. toctree::
   :hidden:

   /release-notes/2.4-javascript

In 2.4 the default JavaScript engine in the :program:`mongo` shell
:program:`mongod` is now V8. This change affects all JavaScript
behavior including the :dbcommand:`mapReduce`, :dbcommand:`group`, and
:dbcommand:`eval` commands, as well as the :operator:`$where` query
operator.

Use the new :js:func:`interpreterVersion()` method in the
:program:`mongo` shell and the
:data:`~buildInfo.javascriptEngine` field in the output of
:method:`db.serverBuildInfo()` to determine which JavaScript engine a
MongoDB binary uses.

The primary impacts of the change from the previous JavaScript engine,
SpiderMonkey, to V8 are:

- improved concurrency for JavaScript operations,
- modernized JavaScript implementation, and
- removed non-standard SpiderMonkey features.

See :doc:`/release-notes/2.4-javascript` for more information about
all changes .

Additional Limitations for Map-Reduce and ``$where`` Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-group-map-reduce-where-limitations-in-24.rst

.. DOCS-752

Improvements to the Aggregation Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.4 introduces a number of additional functionality and
improved performance for the :doc:`Aggregation Framework
</core/aggregation>`. Consider the following additions in 2.4:

- :pipeline:`$match` queries now support the :operator:`$geoWithin`
  operator for bounded geospatial queries.

- The new :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline stage to support
  geospatial queries.

- :group:`$min` operator only considers non-null and existing field
  values. If all the values for a field are ``null`` or are missing,
  the operator returns ``null`` for the minimum value.

- For sort operations where the :pipeline:`$sort` stage
  immediately precedes a :pipeline:`$limit` in the pipeline, the
  MongoDB can perform a more efficient sort that does not require
  keeping the entire result set in memory.

- The new :expression:`$millisecond` operator returns the millisecond
  portion of a date.

- The new :expression:`$concat` operator concatenates array of strings.
