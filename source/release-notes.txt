MongoDB Version Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For MongoDB ``2.4.1``, ``2.4`` refers to the release series and ``.1`` refers
to the revision. The second component of the release series (e.g. ``4``
in ``2.4.1``) describes the type of release series. Release series ending
with even numbers (e.g. ``4`` above) are *stable* and ready for
production, while odd numbers are for *development* and testing only.

Generally, changes in the release series (e.g. ``2.2`` to ``2.4``)
mark the introduction of new features that may break backwards
compatibility. Changes to the revision number mark the release bug
fixes and backwards-compatible changes.

.. important:: Always upgrade to the latest stable revision of your
   release series.

The version numbering system for MongoDB differs from the system
used for the MongoDB drivers. Drivers use only the first number to indicate
a major version. For details, see :ref:`drivers-version-numbers`.

.. example:: Version numbers

   - 2.0.0 : Stable release.

   - 2.0.1 : Revision.

   - 2.1.0 : Development release *for testing only*. Includes new features and changes for
     testing. Interfaces and stability may not be compatible in
     development releases.

   - 2.2.0 : Stable release. This is a culmination of the 2.1.x
     development series.
