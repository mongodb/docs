Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform
**aggregation operations**.

You can use aggregation operations to process data in your MongoDB collections and
return computed results. The MongoDB Aggregation framework, which is
part of the Query API, is modeled on the concept of a data processing
pipeline. Documents enter a pipeline that contains one or more stages,
and each stage transforms the documents to output a final aggregated result.

You can think of an aggregation operation as similar to a car factory. A car factory has
an assembly line, which contains assembly stations with specialized
tools to do specific jobs, like drills and welders. Raw parts enter the
factory, and then the assembly line transforms and assembles them into a
finished product.

The **aggregation pipeline** is the assembly line, **aggregation stages** are the
assembly stations, and **operator expressions** are the
specialized tools.

Compare Aggregation and Find Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use find operations to perform the following actions:

- Select which documents to return
- Select which fields to return
- Sort the results

You can use aggregation operations to perform the following actions:

- Perform find operations
- Rename fields
- Calculate fields
- Summarize data
- Group values

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following limitations apply when using aggregation operations:

- Returned documents must not violate the
  :manual:`BSON document size limit </reference/limits/#mongodb-limit-BSON-Document-Size>`
  of 16 megabytes.
- Pipeline stages have a memory limit of 100 megabytes by default. You can exceed this
  limit by using the ``allowDiskUse()`` method from ``AggregateIterable`` class. 

.. important:: $graphLookup exception

   The :manual:`$graphLookup
   </reference/operator/aggregation/graphLookup/>` stage has a strict
   memory limit of 100 megabytes and ignores the ``allowDiskUse`` option.

Aggregation Example
-------------------

The examples in this section use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

The following {+language+} data class models the documents in this collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/aggregation.kt
   :start-after: start-data-class
   :end-before: end-data-class
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:

Build and Execute an Aggregation Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an aggregation on the documents in a collection, pass a list of aggregation
stages to the ``aggregate()`` method.

This example outputs a count of the number of bakeries in each borough
of New York City. The following code creates aggregation pipeline that contains the
following stages:

- A :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage to filter for documents
  in which the value of the ``cuisine`` field is ``"Bakery"``.

- A :manual:`$group </reference/operator/aggregation/group/>` stage to group the matching
  documents by the ``borough`` field, producing a count of documents for each distinct
  value of that field.

.. TODO: uncomment when Aggregates Builder page is created

.. .. note::

..    The following example uses the builders pattern to implement the stages of an
..    aggregation pipeline. To learn more about how to use the builders pattern, see
..    :ref:`<aggregates-builders>`

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/aggregation/aggregation.kt
      :language: kotlin
      :start-after: start-aggregation-pipeline
      :end-before: end-aggregation-pipeline
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      Document{{_id=Bronx, count=71}}
      Document{{_id=Manhattan, count=221}}
      Document{{_id=Brooklyn, count=173}}
      Document{{_id=Queens, count=204}}
      Document{{_id=Staten Island, count=20}}
      Document{{_id=Missing, count=2}}

.. tip::

   When specifying a group key for the ``$group`` aggregation stage, ensure that you
   escape any ``$`` characters by using the ``\`` character. 

Explain an Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view information about how MongoDB executes your operation, you can
include the ``$explain`` aggregation stage in your pipeline. When MongoDB explains an
operation, it returns **execution plans** and performance statistics. An execution
plan is a potential way MongoDB can complete an operation.
When you instruct MongoDB to explain an operation, it returns both the
plan MongoDB selected for the operation and any rejected execution plans.

The following code example runs the same aggregation shown in the preceding section
and adds the ``$explain`` stage to output the operation details:

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /includes/aggregation/aggregation.kt
      :language: kotlin
      :start-after: start-aggregation-explain
      :end-before: end-aggregation-explain
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false
    
      {
        "explainVersion": "2", 
        "queryPlanner": {
            "namespace": "sample_restaurants.restaurants"
            "indexFilterSet": false,
            "parsedQuery": {
              "cuisine": {"$eq": "Bakery"}
            }, 
            "queryHash": "865F14C3", 
            "planCacheKey": "0697561B", 
            "optimizedPipeline": true,
            "maxIndexedOrSolutionsReached": false,
            "maxIndexedAndSolutionsReached": false,
            "maxScansToExplodeReached": false,
            "winningPlan": { ... }
            ...
        }
        ...
      }
