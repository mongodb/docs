Overview
--------

To connect to a MongoDB deployment, you must create the following items:

- **Connection URI**, also known as a *connection string*, which tells the {+library-short+}
  which MongoDB deployment to connect to.
- **MongoDB\\Client** object, which creates the connection to the MongoDB deployment
  and lets you perform operations on it.

You can also set options within either or both of these components to
customize the way that the {+library-short+} behaves
while connected to MongoDB.

This guide describes the components of a connection string and shows how to
use a ``MongoDB\Client`` object to connect to a MongoDB deployment.

.. _php-connection-uri:

Connection URI
--------------

A standard connection string includes the following components:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Component
     - Description

   * - ``mongodb://``

     - Required. A prefix that identifies this as a string in the
       standard connection format.

   * - ``db_username:db_password``

     - Optional. Authentication credentials. If you include these, the client
       authenticates the user against the database specified in ``authSource``.
       For more information about the ``authSource`` connection option, see
       :ref:`php-auth`. 

   * - ``host[:port]``

     - Required. The host and optional port number where MongoDB is running. If you don't
       include the port number, the driver uses the default port, ``27017``.

   * - ``/defaultauthdb``
     
     - Optional. The authentication database to use if the
       connection string includes ``db_username:db_password@``
       authentication credentials but not the ``authSource`` option. If you don't include 
       this component, the client authenticates the user against the ``admin`` database.

   * - ``?<options>``

     - Optional. A query string that specifies connection-specific
       options as ``<name>=<value>`` pairs. See
       :ref:`php-connection-options` for a full description of
       these options.

To learn more about connection strings, see
:manual:`Connection Strings </reference/connection-string>` in the
Server manual.

Create a MongoDB\Client
-----------------------

To create a connection to MongoDB, pass your connection string when constructing
an instance of the ``MongoDB\Client`` class.

In the following example, the library uses a sample connection URI to connect to a MongoDB 
deployment on port ``27017`` of ``localhost``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/client.php
   :language: php
   :copyable: true
