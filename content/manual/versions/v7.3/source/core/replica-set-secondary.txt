A secondary maintains a copy of the :term:`primary's <primary>` data
set. To replicate data, a secondary applies operations from the
primary's :ref:`oplog <replica-set-oplog>` to its own data set
in an asynchronous process. [#slow-oplogs]_ A replica set can have one or more
secondaries.

The following three-member replica set has two secondary
members. The secondaries replicate the primary's oplog and apply
the operations to their data sets.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-primary-with-two-secondaries.rst

Although clients cannot write data to secondaries, clients can read
data from secondary members. See :doc:`/core/read-preference` for more
information on how clients direct read operations to replica sets.

A secondary can become a primary.
If the current primary becomes unavailable, the replica set
holds an :term:`election` to choose which of the secondaries
becomes the new primary.

.. start-content-election-example

In the following three-member replica set, the primary becomes unavailable.
This triggers an election where one of the remaining
secondaries becomes the new primary.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-trigger-election.rst

.. end-content-election-example

See
:doc:`/core/replica-set-elections` for more details.

You can configure a secondary member for a specific purpose. You can
configure a secondary to:

- Prevent it from becoming a primary in an election, which allows it to
  reside in a secondary data center or to serve as a cold standby. See
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-priority-0-member`.

- Prevent applications from reading from it, which allows it to run applications
  that require separation from normal traffic. See
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-hidden-member`.

- Keep a running "historical" snapshot for use in recovery from
  certain errors, such as unintentionally deleted databases. See
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-delayed-member`.
