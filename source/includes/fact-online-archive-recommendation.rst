You can configure :ref:`Online Archive <manage-online-archive>` to 
move infrequently accessed data from your |service| cluster to a 
MongoDB-managed read-only |data-lake| instead of sharding your 
collection or upgrading your cluster tier. To learn more about 
Online Archive, see :ref:`manage-online-archive`.
