  |onprem| 4.2 and later differs from 4.0 in how it manages index. To

  .. admonition:: Deployments using Kerberos Authentication
     :class: important

     Don't add either of the following settings from the legacy Agents:

     - ``krb5Principal``
     - ``krb5Keytab``

     Your legacy Agents authenticated with Kerberos as separate database
     users. Because the {+mdbagent+} combines the functions of the
     legacy Agents, it employs a *single* database user. To upgrade to 
     the {+mdbagent+} and continue using Kerberos, you must:

     1. Create a new :ref:`Kerberos User Principal
        <create-krb5-upn-for-mongodb-agent>` and :ref:`database user
        <create-mongodb-user-for-mongodb-agent>` for the
        {+mdbagent+}.
     #. Update the :ref:`Agent authentication configuration
        <enable-kerberos-mms>` in the |mms| :guilabel:`Authentication &
        TLS` settings with the new {+mdbagent+} Principal and Keytab 
        files.

     You can remove the legacy Monitoring and Backup Agent users after
     updating to the {+mdbagent+}. 

  To add options that you had for your
  :doc:`Backup Agent </reference/backup-agent>` and
  :doc:`Monitoring Agent </reference/monitoring-agent>`:

  a. Under the :guilabel:`Backup Configurations` section:

     i. Type the :doc:`desired setting </reference/backup-agent>`
        in the :guilabel:`Setting` box and its corresponding value in the
        :guilabel:`Value` box.

     #. To add more than one :guilabel:`Setting`, click the
        :guilabel:`+ Add Setting` link. Another row appears.

     #. Repeat until all settings have been added.

  b. Under the :guilabel:`Monitoring Configurations` section:

     i. Type the :doc:`desired setting </reference/monitoring-agent>`
        in the :guilabel:`Setting` box and the corresponding value in the
        :guilabel:`Value` box.

     #. To add more than one :guilabel:`Setting`, click the
        :guilabel:`+ Add Setting` link. Another row appears.

     #. Repeat until all settings have been added.

  c. Once you have added all the settings necessary for your deployment, click :guilabel:`Next`.


  You can click the :icon-fa5:`trash-alt` to remove any settings that
  you have added.

  .. important::

     |mms| does not validate any of these settings. Make sure that the
     settings and values are correct.
