"Balancing is the process MongoDB uses to distribute data of a sharded "
"collection evenly across a :term:`sharded cluster`. When a :term:`shard` has"
" too many of a sharded collection's :term:`chunks <chunk>` compared to other"
" shards, MongoDB automatically balances the chunks across the shards. The "
"balancing procedure for :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` is "
