The :guilabel:`Charts Settings` link appears in the sidebar of the
Charts UI. All users can access this page. The sections you see depend
on the |service| :atlas:`roles </reference/user-roles/>` you have.

.. _admin-usage:

Monthly Data Usage
------------------

.. include:: /includes/charts-settings-project-owner.rst

The :guilabel:`Usage` panel of the :guilabel:`Charts Settings` page shows
the data usage of your |charts| instance over the current month.

The panel displays the following metrics:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Total Data Usage`
     - Total data usage in ``GB`` that your |charts-short| instance has
       consumed over the current month.

   * - :guilabel:`Free Tier Remaining`
     - Amount of data in ``GB`` that your |charts-short| instance can
       still use this month for free. If you exceed this amount, your
       |charts-short| instance starts
       :ref:`incurring charges <charts-billing>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Days Remaining`
     - Days remaining in the current month, after which the usage cycle
       resets.

MongoDB provides a free ``1 GB`` of data transfers per month. Nearly
all |charts-short| use cases should fall within this ``1 GB`` free
tier. For more information on |charts| pricing and sample pricing
scenarios, see :ref:`charts-billing`.

.. _add-sample-dashboard:

Add a Sample Dashboard
----------------------

You can add a new sample dashboard even if there is an existing sample
dashboard in your |charts-short| project. This can be useful if you have made
changes to a previously-created sample dashboard and want a fresh copy.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: includes/steps/add-sample-dashboard.rst

.. _embedding-auth-providers:

Embedding Authentication Providers
----------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/charts-settings-project-owner.rst

The :guilabel:`Embedding Authentication Providers` panel lists the 
providers |charts-short| can use to authenticate users who access 
embedded charts.

|charts-short| requires a token from one of the providers you configure
to render authenticated charts embedded with the SDK.

For more information about embedding authentication providers, see 
:doc:`/configure-auth-providers`.

Embedding Key Generation
------------------------

.. include:: /includes/charts-settings-project-owner.rst

.. important::

   Embedding keys are deprecated and will be removed in a future 
   release. Use :doc:`Embedding Authentication Providers 
   </configure-auth-providers>` and the :doc:`Embedding SDK 
   </embedding-charts-sdk>` instead.

Embedding keys are necessary for generating and verifying digital 
signatures of charts embedded using the Verified Signature mode. 

To generate a new embedding key, click the :guilabel:`Generate New Key`
button on the right side of the page.

.. warning::

   If you generate a new key, any previous keys become invalid. Ensure
   that all the existing embedded charts that use the old key are
   updated to use the new key.
