The :guilabel:`General` connection tab allows you to select a 
:guilabel:`Connection String Scheme` and configure the hostname or hosts 
used to connect to your MongoDB deployment.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`General` tab.

      .. procedure::
         :style: connected

         .. step:: Select a connection string scheme.

            You can select one of the following options:

               * - Connection String Scheme
                 - Definition

               * - mongodb
                 - :manual:`Standard Connection String Format </reference/connection-string/>`. 
                   The standard format of the MongoDB connection URI is used to 
                   connect to a MongoDB deployment by specifying its hosts directly.

               * - mongodb+srv 
                 - :manual:`DNS Seed List Connection Format 
                   </reference/connection-string/#dns-seed-list-connection-format>`. 
                   The ``+srv`` indicates to |compass| that the hostname that follows 
                   corresponds to a DNS SRV record.

         .. step:: Enter a Hostname.

            In the :guilabel:`Host` field, enter the hosts or hostname of the server 
            where the deployment is running.

            If you are running your deployment locally, this value is ``localhost``. 
            If you are connecting to an Atlas cluster, see 
            :atlas:`Connect to Database Deployment </connect-to-database-deployment/>` 
            for Atlas-specific guidance on how to connect with |compass-short|.

            If you are not sure of your hostname, contact your Database 
            Administrator for information.

         .. step:: (Optional) Enable Direct Connection. 

            When you use the ``mongodb`` Connection String Scheme, you have the 
            option to enable a :driver:`Direct Connection 
            </node/current/fundamentals/connection/#direct-connection>`. When you 
            enable this setting, |compass-short| runs all operations on the specified 
            host.

            .. important::
               When you specify ``directConnection`` and connect to a secondary member 
               of a replica set, your write operations fail because it is not the 
               primary member.

   .. step:: (Optional) For advanced connection configuration options, click the :ref:`Advanced <advanced-connection-tab>` tab.

   .. step:: Click Connect.
