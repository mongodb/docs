Request Path Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Required/Optional
     - Description

   * - ``GROUP-ID``

     - Required.

     - The unique identifier for the :ref:`project <group-id>`.

.. include:: /includes/no-query-parameters.rst

Request Body Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Description

   * - ``databaseName``
     - The user's :ref:`authentication database <authentication-database>`. A
       user must provide both a username and authentication database to log
       into MongoDB. In |service| deployments of MongoDB, the authentication
       database is always the ``admin`` database.

   * - ``groupId``
     - ID of the |service| project the user belongs to.

   * - ``username``
     - The username for authenticating to MongoDB.

   * - ``roles``
     - An array of the user's roles and the database on which the user has
       each role. A role allows the user to perform particular actions on the
       specified database. A role on the ``admin`` database can include
       privileges that apply to the other databases as well.

   * - ``roles.databaseName``
     - The database on which the user has the specified role. A role on the
       ``admin`` database can include privileges that apply to the other
       databases.

   * - ``roles.collectionName``

     - The collection for which the role applies.

       You can specify a collection for the ``read`` and ``readWrite``
       roles. If you do not specify a collection for the ``read`` and
       ``readWrite`` roles, the roles apply to all collections
       (excluding some ``system.`` collections) in the specified database.

   * - ``roles.roleName``
     - The name of the role. 
     
       The following possible values of ``role`` are restricted to the
       ``admin`` database:
       
       - :atlasrole:`atlasAdmin <Atlas admin>`
       - :authrole:`readWriteAnyDatabase`
       - :authrole:`readAnyDatabase`
       - :authrole:`clusterMonitor`
       - :authrole:`backup`
       - :authrole:`dbAdminAnyDatabase`
       - ``enableSharding``

         This role is specific to MongoDB databases managed by |service|. The
         role allows the user to enable sharding on a database and to shard a
         collection.
       
       The following possible values of ``role`` can be applied to a specific
       database:

       - :authrole:`dbAdmin`
       - :authrole:`read`
       - :authrole:`readWrite`

       The following values of ``role`` can be applied to a specific collection:

       - :authrole:`read`
       - :authrole:`readWrite`

       If you do not specify a collection for the ``read`` and
       ``readWrite`` roles, the roles apply to all collections
       (excluding some ``system.`` collections) in the database.

   * - ``password``
     - The user's password. This field is NOT included in the entity returned
       from the server.

Response Elements

If you set the query element ``envelope`` to ``true``, the response is wrapped
by the ``content`` object.
