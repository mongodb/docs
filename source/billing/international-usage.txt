United States (USA), add your |vat| or |gst| Number in the 
:guilabel:`VAT/GST ID` field on the :guilabel:`Payment Method` or the 
:guilabel:`Billing Profile` modal.

|service| displays the :guilabel:`VAT/GST ID` field only if you select 
a country other than the United States.

.. _payment-processing-india:

Payment Processing in India
---------------------------

.. include:: /includes/facts/payment-processing-india.rst

The |rbi| requires a *mandate* for recurring payments to ensure you 
aren't charged above a certain amount each billing period. MongoDB 
automatically registers a mandate for $1,400 |usd| each month when 
you :ref:`add a payment method <add-method-payment-processing-india>` 
or :ref:`retry a payment <retry-payment-processing-india>`.

Mandates
~~~~~~~~

The mandate that MongoDB registers on your behalf permits MongoDB to 
charge your credit card up to $1,400 |usd| per month. This might be 
presented by your card issuer or bank in |inr| instead of |usd|.

MongoDB charges your credit card for your usage only. The $1,400 
mandate is a limit on the amount you can be charged per month.

You manage your mandates through your card issuer or bank. When you 
:ref:`add a payment method <add-method-payment-processing-india>` or 
:ref:`retry a payment <retry-payment-processing-india>` with a credit 
card from a credit card issuer based in India, according to |rbi| 
regulations, your card issuer or bank provides a 
link to manage your mandates.

Payment Statuses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your credit card issuer is based in India, you might see two
additional :atlas:`payment statuses </billing/invoices/#payments>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 10 20

   * - Status
     - Description

   * - ``PROCESSING``
     - The payment is pending due to |rbi| regulations and might 
       require authorization.

       A payment might stay in the processing state for several days.
       During this time, according to |rbi| regulations, your card 
       issuer will notify you of the charge and provide a link for you 
       to revoke your mandate. No action is required unless the payment 
       is for more than ₹15,000 |inr|.

       If the payment is for more than ₹15,000 |inr|, the notification 
       you receive from your card issuer includes a link to authorize 
       that payment. You must authorize the payment to successfully 
       pay, otherwise the payment fails with the ``FAILED`` status.

       If you revoke your mandate, attempts to charge your credit card 
       fail until you register a new mandate. Register a mandate by 
       :ref:`adding a payment method <add-method-payment-processing-india>` or 
       :ref:`retrying a payment <retry-payment-processing-india>`

   * - ``PENDING_REVERSAL``	
     - The payment is pending, but will be refunded or cancelled as 
       soon as possible.
       
       If the payment succeeds, MongoDB refunds it. If the payment 
       fails, MongoDB cancels it.

.. important::
   
   If you pay with a credit card from a credit card issuer based in 
   India, you are charged in |inr|. However, the |service| UI and 
   MongoDB communications typically present prices in |usd|. 
   
   MongoDB uses the currency conversion rate at the time your payment 
   moves to the ``PROCESSING`` status to convert between 
   |inr| and |usd|.

.. _add-method-payment-processing-india:

Adding a Payment Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you add a credit card from a credit card issuer based in India as 
your payment method, |service| prompts you to verify your identity. 
After you verify your identity, |service| might take up to 2 minutes to 
add your credit card. MongoDB registers a mandate on your behalf.

According to |rbi| regulations, your card issuer will notify you via 
|sms| that a mandate was registered on your behalf.

.. _retry-payment-processing-india:

Retrying a Payment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you retry a payment from the |service| UI, MongoDB prompts you 
to verify your identity and then registers a new mandate on your behalf.

According to |rbi| regulations, your card issuer will notify you via 
|sms| that a mandate was registered on your behalf.

.. _sca-changes:

Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) Changes
--------------------------------------------

|sca| is a new European regulatory requirement to reduce fraud and make
online payments more secure. All payment service providers are required
to build additional authentication into their checkout flow once |sca|
goes into effect. Customers in
`European Economic Area (EEA) <https://www.efta.int/eea>`__ might be
required to authenticate their credit cards depending on the card's
issuer, starting 14 September 2019. If your credit card issuer
requires authentication, review the following :ref:`sca-auth-process`
to continue paying for |service-fullname| seamlessly with a credit
card.

Marketing emails will be sent out to affected customers announcing the
policy change and the steps necessary to comply with |sca|.

.. _sca-auth-process:

Authentication Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections cover different ways to authenticate your credit
card to comply with Strong Customer Authentication.

Deploy a Paid Database as a New User
````````````````````````````````````

New |service| users who do not have a payment method saved can
authenticate a new credit card when paying for a {+database-deployment+} on 
the :guilabel:`Create a Cluster` page. To learn more, see
:ref:`create-new-database-deployment`.

Edit Payment Method
```````````````````

Existing users can edit their :guilabel:`Payment Method` to
authenticate a new credit card or reauthenticate an existing credit
card to comply with |sca|:

.. include:: /includes/steps-billing-payments-edit.rst

Once you update your credit card information and authenticate, you will
be automatically charged for all existing failed payments.

Failed Payment Email
````````````````````

|service| sends an email after a payment failure with a link to your
invoices. Existing users can authenticate a credit card when retrying a
failed payment. To retry the failed payment from the failed payment
email:

.. include:: /includes/steps/billing-payments-retry-from-email.rst

Retry Failed Payment
`````````````````````

Existing users can authenticate a credit card when retrying a failed
payment. To retry the failed payment from within |service|:

.. include:: /includes/steps-billing-payments-retry.rst

Contact Support
