Sharded Cluster Components
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

:term:`Sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` implement
:term:`sharding`. A sharded cluster consists of the following
components:

**Shards**
   A shard is a MongoDB instance that holds a subset of a collectionâ€™s
   data. Each shard is either a single :program:`mongod` instance or a
   :term:`replica set`. In production, all shards are replica
   sets. For more information see :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-shards`.

**Config Servers**
   Each :ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>` is a
   :program:`mongod` instance that holds metadata about the
   cluster. The metadata maps :term:`chunks <chunk>` to shards. For
   more information, see :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-config-servers`.

**Routing Instances**
   Each router is a :program:`mongos` instance that routes the reads
   and writes from applications to the shards.  Applications do not
   access the shards directly. For more information see
   :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-query-router`.

Enable sharding in MongoDB on a per-collection basis. For each
collection you shard, you will specify a :term:`shard key` for that
collection.
