.. dbcommand:: ping

   The :dbcommand:`ping` command is a no-op used to test whether a
   server is responding to commands. This command will return
   immediately even if the server is write-locked:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { ping: 1 }

   The value (e.g. ``1`` above) does not impact the behavior of the
   command.
