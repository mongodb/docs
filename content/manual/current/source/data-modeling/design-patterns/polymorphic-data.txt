Generally, documents in a collection are similar in structure but may
contain slight variations depending on the application. To group
similar, non-identical documents in a single collection you can use the
:ref:`Polymorphic <polymorphic-schema-pattern>` and the
:ref:`Inheritance <inheritance-schema-pattern>` schema design patterns.

These schema designs can improve performance by storing data based on
query access patterns, rather than storing data strictly based on
document shape.

Use Cases
---------

   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10

   * - Scenario
     - Design Pattern Application

   * - Your application tracks professional athletes across different
       sports. Your queries access all athletes, but the attributes
       stored for each athlete vary depending on their sport.
     - Use the **polymorphic pattern** to group athletes in a single
       collection. Even though the documents have different shapes, they
       can still be accessed with a single query.

   * - Your application tracks books in a bookstore. Books can be available in 
       different forms: ebook, print, or audiobook. All books share the fields of 
       ``title``, ``author``, and ``genre`` but have additional differing fields 
       depending on their format.
     - Use the **inheritance pattern** to group books into a single collection. 
       Each book format is a child entity of the parent entity of ``book`` 
       that provides the shared fields of ``title``, ``author``, and ``genre`` 
       across all formats. Despite the additional differing fields of the child 
       entities, the shared fields from the parent entity allow them to be grouped 
       into a single collection.
