Overview
--------

|service| supports deploying clusters in the |aws| regions Beijing and
Ningxia. Setting up a cluster to use those regions requires additional
steps which are outlined on this page.

.. important::

   Deploying clusters in the Chinese regions requires pre-authorization for
   your |service| organization. Contact |service| Support to enroll your
   |service| organization.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/aws-china-prereqs.rst

Procedure
---------

Before deploying clusters in the Chinese regions, you must create a project
specifically for those clusters. Clusters in your dedicated project can only
be deployed to the Chinese regions.

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-china-regions-project.rst

You are now ready to deploy a new |service| cluster in the |aws| Chinese regions. 
Detailed instructions for creating a new cluster are in the :ref:`Create
a New Cluster <create-new-cluster>` tutorial.

Restrictions
------------

The configuration options for clusters in your dedicated China regions
project are limited to:

- The cloud provider |aws|.
- The regions Beijing (``cn-north-1``) and Ningxia (``cn-northwest-1``).
- Cluster :ref:`tiers <create-cluster-instance>` ``M10`` and higher.

The following MongoDB services are not available to clusters deployed in
the Chinese regions:

- `Realm <https://docs.mongodb.com/realm>`__
- `Charts <https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/>`__
- `Data Lake <https://docs.mongodb.com/datalake/>`__

Projects in the Chinese regions may only use |aws| :ref:`customer managed
encryption keys <security-aws-kms>` created in the AWS Chinese regions.
