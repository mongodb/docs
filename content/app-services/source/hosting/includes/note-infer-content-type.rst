.. note::

   If you do not specify a ``Content-Type`` metadata attribute for a hosted
   file, Atlas App Services will attempt to automatically add a ``Content-Type``
   attribute to it based on the file extension.
   
   For example, App Services would automatically add the attribute
   ``Content-Type: application/html`` to the file ``myPage.html``.
