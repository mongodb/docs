Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: killCursors

   Kills the specified cursor or cursors for a collection. MongoDB
   drivers use the :dbcommand:`killCursors` command as part of the
   client-side cursor implementation.

   .. note::

      In general, applications should not use the
      :dbcommand:`killCursors` command directly.

   .. |command| replace:: killCursors

   The ``killCursors`` command must be run against the database of the
   collection whose cursors you wish to kill.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand.rst

   The command has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( { "killCursors": <collection>, "cursors": [ <cursor id1>, ... ] } )

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-killCursors-field.rst

Required Access
---------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.6.3

To successfully execute a :dbcommand:`killCursors` command, all cursors
that you wish to kill must be associated with a currently authenticated
user. MongoDB associates cursors with the users that were authenticated when
the cursor was created. If the operation is not successful due to
permission issues, the command returns an error message.

Alternatively, if a user possesses the :authaction:`killAnyCursor`
privilege, that user may kill any cursor regardless of what users the
cursor is associated with.

Example
-------

Consider the following :dbcommand:`find` operation on the
``test.restaurants`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use test
   db.runCommand(
      { find: "restaurants",
        filter: { stars: 5 },
        projection: { name: 1, rating: 1, address: 1 },
        sort: { name: 1 },
        batchSize: 5
      }
   )

which returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "waitedMS" : NumberLong(0),
      "cursor" : {
         "firstBatch" : [
            {
               "_id" : ObjectId("57506d63f578028074723dfd"),
               "name" : "Cakes and more"
            },
            {
               "_id" : ObjectId("57506d63f578028074723e0b"),
               "name" : "Pies and things"
            },
            {
               "_id" : ObjectId("57506d63f578028074723e1d"),
               "name" : "Ice Cream Parlour"
            },
            {
               "_id" : ObjectId("57506d63f578028074723e65"),
               "name" : "Cream Puffs"
            },
            {
               "_id" : ObjectId("57506d63f578028074723e66"),
               "name" : "Cakes and Rolls"
            }
         ],
         "id" : NumberLong("18314637080"),
         "ns" : "test.restaurants"
      },
      "ok" : 1
   }

To kill this cursor, use the :dbcommand:`killCursors` command.

.. code-block:: javascript

   use test

   db.runCommand( { killCursors: "restaurants", cursors: [ NumberLong("18314637080") ] } )

:dbcommand:`killCursors` returns the following operation details:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "cursorsKilled" : [
         NumberLong("18314637080")
      ],
      "cursorsNotFound" : [ ],
      "cursorsAlive" : [ ],
      "cursorsUnknown" : [ ],
      "ok" : 1
   }
