   :description: Update your MongoDB deployment to the MongoDB Agent from legacy Monitoring and Backup Agents using Cloud Manager.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You have a project with automated MongoDB deployments that may include
both Automation-managed and standalone Backup and Monitoring Agents.
You want to update to the {+mdbagent+}.

To update to the {+mdbagent+}, use the following procedures:

- For any standalone legacy Agents:

  - :doc:`/tutorial/update-mongodb-agent-from-monitoring-agent`

  - :doc:`/tutorial/update-mongodb-agent-from-backup-and-monitoring-agents`

- For those hosts where Automation manages Monitoring/Backup Agents:

  - :doc:`/tutorial/update-mongodb-agent-from-all-agents`

Next Steps

After the {+mdbagent+} update completes:

- If you did not update Backup or Monitoring Agents when you installed
  the {+mdbagent+}, you can activate
  :ref:`{+bagent+} <activate-backup>`,
  :ref:`{+magent+} <activate-monitoring>`, or both on your MongoDB
  deployment.

- :ref:`Stop <stop-monitoring-agent>` and
  :doc:`remove </tutorial/delete-monitoring-agent>` the legacy
  Monitoring Agent.

- :ref:`Stop <stop-backup-agent>` and
  :doc:`remove </tutorial/delete-backup-agent>` the legacy Backup
  Agent.
