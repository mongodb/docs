=============================
Replica Set Secondary Members
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. start-content

A secondary maintains a replica of the :term:`primary's <primary>` data set. To replicate
the data set, a secondary replicates the primary's :doc:`oplog
</core/replica-set-oplog>`. The secondary then applies the oplog operations to
itself in an asynchronous process. A replica set can have one or
more secondaries.

The following three-member replica set has two secondary
members. The secondaries replicate the primary's oplog and apply
the operations to their data sets.

Although secondary members cannot accept write operations from client applications, they can
accept read operations. See
:doc:`/core/read-preference` for more information on how clients direct
read operations to replica sets.

A secondary can become a primary.
If the current primary becomes unavailable, the replica set
holds an :term:`election` to choose with of the secondaries
becomes the new primary.

.. start-content-election-example

In the following three-member replica set, the primary becomes unavailable.
This triggers an election where one of the remaining
secondaries becomes the new primary.

.. include:: /images/replica-set-trigger-election.rst

.. end-content-election-example

See
:doc:`/core/replica-set-elections` for more details.

You can configure a secondary member for a specific purpose. You can
configure a secondary to:

- Prevent it from becoming a primary in an election, which allows it to
  reside in a secondary data center or to serve as a cold standby. See
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-priority-0-member`.

- Prevent applications from reading from it, which allows it to run applications
  that require separation from normal traffic. See
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-hidden-member`.

- Keep a running "historical" snapshot for use in recovery from
  certain errors, such as unintentionally deleted databases. See
  :doc:`/core/replica-set-delayed-member`.
