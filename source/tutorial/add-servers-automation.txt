Procedure
---------

Install the Automation Agent on each server that you want |mms| to
manage. The following procedure applies to all operating systems. For
instructions for a specific operating system, see
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent`.

On Linux servers, if you installed MongoDB with a package manager, use the
same package manager to install the Automation Agent. If you installed
MongoDB without a package manager, use an archive to install the
Automation Agent.
