The following procedure walks you through linking an |idp| to |mms|.

Federation Management Access
----------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-fed-management-access.rst

Procedure
---------

.. admonition:: Two-Stage Configuration
   :class: important

   Depending on your Identity Provider, some circular logic may apply
   when linking it to a Service Provider like |mms|. To
   link your |idp| to |mms|:

   - Your IdP needs values from |mms| and
   - |mms| needs values from your IdP.

   To simplify setup, |mms| prompts you to enter placeholder values
   for the IdP and |mms| configurations. You will replace these
   values later in the procedure.

.. _configure-idp-app:

Configure An External Identity Provider Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure Federated Authentication, you must have an external
|saml| |idp| application. In the |saml| |idp|, you must:

1. Create a new application for |mms|.

#. Configure initial |saml| values for the new application:

   a. Set placeholder values for the following fields:

      - :guilabel:`SP Entity ID or Issuer`
      - :guilabel:`Audience URI`
      - :guilabel:`Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL`

   b. Set valid values for the following fields:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :stub-columns: 1
         :widths: 40 60

         * - Field
           - Value

         * - :guilabel:`Signature Algorithm`
           - The signature algorithm is the algorithm used
             to encrypt the |idp| signature. |mms| supports the
             following signature algorithm values:

             - ``SHA-1``
             - ``SHA-256``

         * - :guilabel:`Name ID`
           - ``Email Address``

         * - :guilabel:`Name ID Format`
           - ``urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified``

   c. Create attributes with Attribute Names for the following
      Attribute Values:

      - ``firstName``
      - ``lastName``
      - ``email``

      .. note::

         The names of these attributes are case sensitive. Type these
         attribute names as shown in
         :wikipedia:`camelCase </Camel_case>`.

   d. Save these values.

Once you have completed the initial setup for your |idp| application,
you link the |idp| to |mms| to federate your users' logins.

Apply Your Identity Provider to |mms|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. admonition:: Prerequisite
   :class: note

   This procedure assumes you already have an external |idp|. To learn
   how to configure an |idp|, see :ref:`configure-idp-app`.

You can configure Federated Authentication in |mms| from the
:guilabel:`Federation Management Console`. Use this console to:

- Configure :guilabel:`Identity Providers` to authenticate users
  belonging to specified organizations.
- Connect |mms| :guilabel:`Organizations` to your |idp|.
- Verify and associate :guilabel:`Domains` with your |idp| to force
  users to authenticate using that IdP.

Open the Management Console
```````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-open-fed-auth-console.rst

From the Management Console:
````````````````````````````

1. Click :guilabel:`Add Identity Providers`

#. If you do not have any Identity Providers configured yet, click
   :guilabel:`Setup Identity Provider`. Otherwise, On the
   :guilabel:`Identity Providers` screen, click
   :guilabel:`Add Identity Provider`.

#. Enter or select the following |saml| Protocol Settings. All fields
   are required:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 40

      * - Field
        - Description

      * - :guilabel:`Configuration Name`
        - Name of identify this |idp| configuration.

      * - :guilabel:`Login URL`
        - URL which serves as the |mms| login page. Give this URL
          to your users to have them bypass the main |mms| login
          page where they enter their username. This URL redirects users
          to the :guilabel:`IdP Single Sign-On URL`.
          
      * - :guilabel:`IdP Issuer URI`
        - Identifier for the issuer of the
          `SAML Assertion <http://saml.xml.org/assertions>`__.

          .. note::

             .. include:: /includes/fact-fed-auth-placeholder-values.rst

      * - :guilabel:`IdP Single Sign-On URL`
        - URL of the receiver of the |saml| AuthNRequest.

          .. note::

             .. include:: /includes/fact-fed-auth-placeholder-values.rst

      * - :guilabel:`IdP Signature Certificate`
        - |pem|-encoded public key certificate of the |idp|. You can
          obtain this value from your |idp|.

      * - :guilabel:`Request Binding`
        - |saml| Authentication Request Protocol binding used to send
          the AuthNRequest. Can be either:

          - ``HTTP POST``
          - ``HTTP REDIRECT``

      * - :guilabel:`Response Signature Algorithm`
        - Response algorithm used to sign the |saml| AuthNRequest. Can
          be either:

          - ``SHA-256``
          - ``SHA-1``

      * - :guilabel:`Apply to Organizations`
        - Organizations to connect to this |idp|. When users
          authenticate through the |idp| for the first time, |mms|
          grants them membership in the selected organizations.
          :ref:`Manage organization mapping 
          <mms-manage-fed-org-map>` to choose what
          :ref:`role <organization-roles>` these users have within the
          selected organizations.

#. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

Configure Your Identity Provider with |mms| Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having set up your |idp| in |mms|, you can provide the required
|mms| metadata to your |idp|.

1. On the :guilabel:`Identity Provider` screen in |mms|, click
   :guilabel:`Download metadata` to download the metadata required
   by your |idp|. |mms| provides the data as an ``.xml`` file.

   .. figure:: /images/customer-fed-download-metadata-border.png
      :width: 550px
      :alt: Image showing how to download metadata

   .. note::
   
      |mms| provides the :guilabel:`Assertion Consumer Service URL`
      and :guilabel:`Audience URI` if you wish to manually copy and
      save these values. These values are included in the metadata
      download.

#. Upload the metadata to your |idp|.

   You now have the necessary information to replace the
   placeholder :guilabel:`IdP Issuer URI` and
   :guilabel:`IdP Single Sign-On URL` values set when you set up the
   initial |idp| mapping in |mms|.

#. In |mms|, modify the placeholder values set for
   :guilabel:`IdP Issuer URI` and :guilabel:`IdP Single Sign-On URL` for
   the linked |idp| with the proper values from your |idp|.

#. Return to |mms| and click :guilabel:`Finish`.

.. important::

   Once you link your |idp| to |mms|, it shows as
   :guilabel:`Inactive` in the
   :guilabel:`Federation Management Console` until you
   :ref:`map at least one domain <mms-manage-fed-domain-map>` to the
   |idp|.

Next Steps
----------

After you successfully linked your |idp| to |mms|, you must
:ref:`map one or more domains <mms-manage-fed-domain-map>` to your
|idp|. |mms| authenticates users from these domains through your |idp|.
