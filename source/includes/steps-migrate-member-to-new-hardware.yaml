  From the :guilabel:`Replica Set Configuration` section, view the
  table under the :guilabel:`Replica Set Settings` heading. The
  :guilabel:`Process Name` column lists the hostname and port of each
  replica set member set. |mms| initially groups the processes under
  the replica set name. Click the :icon:`caret-right` icon to the left
  of the replica set name to list all members associated to the replica
  set.

  Configure the following settings for the
  :guilabel:`Process Name` that corresponds to the newly added member:

  1. From the :guilabel:`Deployment` view, click :guilabel:`Modify`. 
  #. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Member Configuration` section.
  #. Click the :icon:`ellipsis-h` ellipses button for the member you want 
     to remove.
  #. From the menu, select :guilabel:`Remove from Replica Set`.

  .. important::

     Removing the :manual:`primary </reference/glossary/#std-term-primary>` replica set member triggers
     an :manual:`election </core/replica-set-elections/>`. The
     replica set cannot process write operations until the election
     completes. For complete documentation on replica set elections,
     see :manual:`Replica Set Elections </core/replica-set-elections>`.

  Click :guilabel:`Save` to return to the :guilabel:`Deployment`
  screen. 

  Click :guilabel:`Review Changes` and then click
  :guilabel:`Confirm & Deploy`. |mms| converts the removed
  replica set member to a standalone cluster visible in the
  :guilabel:`Deployment` view.

  To remove the member from |mms| management, click the

  :guilabel:`Remove from Cloud Manager`.

  |mms| does not automatically shut down a process removed from
  management. If you did not shut down the process in the previous
  step, you must do so manually by connecting directly to the host
  machine.

  For complete documentation on removing processes from |mms| 
  management, see :doc:`/tutorial/unmanage-deployment`.
