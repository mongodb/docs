|service| displays existing snapshots for a given {+cluster+} on the 
:guilabel:`Snapshots` page. To view snapshots that |service| has 
already taken:

1. Click :guilabel:`Database` in the top-left corner of |service|.
   
#. From the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view, click the cluster name.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

#. Click :guilabel:`Snapshots`.

Alternatively, you can view a list of all ``M10+`` {+clusters+} with
{+cloud-backup+} enabled by clicking :guilabel:`Backup` in the left
navigation pane. If you choose to retain backups from a {+cluster+} you
terminate, they remain accessible here under their source {+cluster+}
name until they expire or you delete them.
