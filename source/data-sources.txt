An |service| :authrole:`Project Owner` can connect or disconnect data
sources and deployments. To learn more, see
:ref:`connect-disconnect-data-source`.

Manage Data Sources
-------------------

To manage settings for a data source, see
:ref:`manage-existing-data-sources`. To manage pipelines, see :ref:`data-sources-pipeline`.

.. note::

   To apply a pipeline, use a charts view. You can't apply
   pipelines to an entire collection.

Manage Deployments
------------------

To manage settings for the |service| deployments that contain your data
sources, see :ref:`manage-deployment`.

To edit the data source for an existing chart:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal
   
   .. step:: Select your dashboard. 
      
      From the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page, select the dashboard that
      contains the chart.
      
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Edit` on the chart you want to edit.
      
   .. step:: Click the button under :guilabel:`Data Source` on the top left of the chart builder. 
      
      The button says :guilabel:`Select` if you have not selected a
      data source, or it says the name of the currently selected data
      source.
