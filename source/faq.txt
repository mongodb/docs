Common Extension Installation Errors
------------------------------------

PHP Headers Not Found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For example:

.. code-block:: none

   /private/tmp/pear/install/mongodb/php_phongo.c:24:10: fatal error: 'php.h' file not found

   #include <php.h>
            ^~~~~~~

This error indicates that PHP's build system cannot find the necessary headers.
All PHP extensions require headers in order to compile. Additionally, those
headers must correspond to the PHP runtime for which the extension will be used.
Generally, the ``phpize`` command (invoked by ``pecl``) will ensure that the
extension builds with the correct headers.

Note that the mere presence of a PHP runtime does not mean that headers are
available. On various Linux distributions, headers are often published under a
separate ``php-dev`` or ``php-devel`` package. On macOS, the default PHP runtime
does not include headers and users typically need to install PHP (and headers)
via `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ in order to build an extension.

Multiple PHP Runtimes Installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your system has multiple versions of PHP installed, each version will have
its own ``pecl`` and ``phpize`` commands. Additionally, each PHP runtime may
have separate ``php.ini`` files for each SAPI (e.g. FPM, CLI). If the extension
has been installed but is not available at runtime, double-check that you have
used the correct ``pecl`` command and have modified the appropriate ``php.ini``
file(s).

If there is any doubt about the ``php.ini`` file being used by a PHP runtime,
you should examine the output of :php:`phpinfo() <phpinfo>` for that particular
SAPI. Additionally, :php:`php_ini_loaded_file() <php_ini_loaded_file>` and
:php:`php_ini_scanned_files() <php_ini_scanned_files>` may be used to determine
exactly which INI files have been loaded by PHP.

To debug issues with the extension not being loaded, you can use the
``detect-extension`` script provided in the tools directory. You can run this
script from the CLI or include it in a script accessible via your web server.
The tool will point out potential issues and installation instructions for your
system. Assuming you've installed the library through Composer, you can call the
script from the vendor directory:

.. code-block:: none

   php vendor/mongodb/mongodb/tools/detect-extension.php

If you want to check configuration for a web server SAPI, include the file in
a script accessible from the web server and open it in your browser. Remember to
wrap the script in ``<pre>`` tags to properly format its output:

.. code-block:: php

   <pre><?php require(...); ?></pre>

Loading an Incompatible DLL on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows binaries are available for various combinations of PHP version,
thread safety (TS or NTS), and architecture (x86 or x64). Failure to select the
correct binary will result in an error when attempting to load the extension DLL
at runtime:

.. code-block:: none

   PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library 'mongodb'

Ensure that you have downloaded a DLL that corresponds to the following PHP
runtime properties:

- PHP version (``PHP_VERSION``)
- Thread safety (``PHP_ZTS``)
- Architecture (``PHP_INT_SIZE``)

In addition to the aforementioned constants, these properties can also be
inferred from :php:`phpinfo() <phpinfo>`. If your system has multiple PHP
runtimes installed, double-check that you are examining the ``phpinfo()`` output
for the correct environment.

The aforementioned ``detect-extension`` script can also be used to determine the
appropriate DLL for your PHP environment.

Connection Handling and Persistence
-----------------------------------

Connections to the MongoDB deployment are handled by the ``libmongoc``
library and the :php:`{+extension-short+} <mongodb>`. When you construct
a :phpclass:`MongoDB\Client` instance, the {+library-short+} creates a
:php:`MongoDB\Driver\Manager <class.mongodb-driver-manager>` instance by using the
same connection string and options. The extension also uses those constructor
arguments to derive a hash key for persistent ``libmongoc`` clients. If
you previously persisted a ``libmongoc`` client by using a key, it is
reused. Otherwise, a new ``libmongoc`` client is created and persisted
for the lifetime of the PHP worker process. You can learn more about
this process in the :php:`{+extension-short+} documentation
<manual/en/mongodb.connection-handling.php>`.

Each ``libmongoc`` client maintains its own connections to the MongoDB deployment
and a view of its topology. When you reuse a persistent ``libmongoc`` client, the
{+library-short+} can avoid the overhead of establishing new connections and
rediscovering the topology. This approach generally improves performance and is
the driver's default behavior.

Persistent ``libmongoc`` clients are not freed until the PHP worker process
ends. This means that connections to a MongoDB deployment might remain open
after a ``MongoDB\Driver\Manager`` object goes out of scope. While this is
typically not an issue for applications that connect to one MongoDB deployment,
it might be problematic in some situations, which are described in the
following list:

- PHP-FPM is configured with ``pm.max_requests=0``, so that workers never respawn, and a
  PHP application is deployed many times with small changes to its MongoDB
  connection string or options. This could lead to an accumulation of ``libmongoc``
  client objects in each worker process.

- An application occasionally connects to a separate MongoDB deployment in a
  backend component where request latency is not the most important aspect.

In the first case, restarting PHP-FPM as part of the application deployment
allows the application to release any unused ``libmongoc`` clients and still use
a persistent client for the latest connection string.

The second case requires a different solution. Specifying ``true`` for the
``disableClientPersistence`` driver option instructs the {+library-short+} to
create a new ``libmongoc`` client and ensure it is freed when the corresponding
``MongoDB\Driver\Manager`` goes out of scope.

The following code demonstrates how to set the
``disableClientPersistence`` option to ``true`` when creating a client:

.. code-block:: php
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   <?php

   $client = new MongoDB\Client(
       uri: getenv('MONGODB_URI') ?: 'mongodb://127.0.0.1/',
       uriOptions: [],
       driverOptions: ['disableClientPersistence' => true],
   );

Use the ``disableClientPersistence`` driver option after careful
consideration, because opting out of client persistence requires more
time to establish connections to the MongoDB deployment and discover its
topology.

Server Selection Failures
-------------------------

The following are all examples of
:doc:`Server Selection </tutorial/server-selection>` failures:

.. code-block:: none

   No suitable servers found (`serverSelectionTryOnce` set):
     [connection refused calling hello on 'a.example.com:27017']
     [connection refused calling hello on 'b.example.com:27017']

   No suitable servers found: `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` expired:
     [socket timeout calling hello on 'example.com:27017']

   No suitable servers found: `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` expired:
     [connection timeout calling hello on 'a.example.com:27017']
     [connection timeout calling hello on 'b.example.com:27017']
     [TLS handshake failed: -9806 calling hello on 'c.example.com:27017']

   No suitable servers found: `serverselectiontimeoutms` timed out:
    [TLS handshake failed: certificate verify failed (64): IP address mismatch calling hello on 'a.example.com:27017']
    [TLS handshake failed: certificate verify failed (64): IP address mismatch calling hello on 'b.example.com:27017']

These errors typically manifest as a
:php:`MongoDB\Driver\Exception\ConnectionTimeoutException <mongodb-driver-exception-connectiontimeoutexception>`
exception from the extension. The actual exception messages originate from
libmongoc, which is the underlying system library used by the extension. Since
these messages can take many forms, it's helpful to break down the structure of
the message so you can better diagnose errors in your application.

Messages will typically start with "No suitable servers found". The next part of
the message indicates *how* server selection failed. By default, the extension
avoids a server selection loop and instead makes a single attempt (according to
the ``serverSelectionTryOnce`` connection string option). If the extension is
configured to utilize a loop, a message like "serverSelectionTimeoutMS expired"
will tell us that we exhausted its time limit.

The last component of the message tells us *why* server selection failed, and
includes one or more errors directly from the topology scanner, which is the
service responsible for connecting to and monitoring each host. Any host that
last experienced an error during monitoring will be included in this list. These
messages typically originate from low-level socket or TLS functions.

The following is not meant to be exhaustive, but will hopefully point you in the
right direction for analyzing the contributing factor(s) for a server selection
failure:

- "connection refused" likely indicates that the remote host is not listening on
  the expected port.
- "connection timeout" could indicate a routing or firewall issue, or perhaps
  a timeout due to latency.
- "socket timeout" suggests that a connection *was* established at some point
  but was dropped or otherwise timed out due to latency.
- "TLS handshake failed" suggests something related to TLS or OCSP verification
  and is sometimes indicative of misconfigured TLS certificates.

In the case of a connection failure, you can use the ``connect`` tool to try and
receive more information. This tool attempts to connect to each host in a
connection string using socket functions to see if it is able to establish a
connection, send, and receive data. The tool takes the connection string to a
MongoDB deployment as its only argument. Assuming you've installed the library
through Composer, you would call the script from the vendor directory:

.. code-block:: none

   php vendor/mongodb/mongodb/tools/connect.php mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017

In case the server does not accept connections, the output will look like this:

.. code-block:: none

   Looking up MongoDB at mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
   Found 1 host(s) in the URI. Will attempt to connect to each.

   Could not connect to 127.0.0.1:27017: Connection refused

.. note::

   The tool only supports the ``mongodb://`` URI schema. Using the
   ``mongodb+srv`` scheme is not supported.
