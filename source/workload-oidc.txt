|workload| lets your applications access MongoDB |service| 
{+clusters+} using external programmatic identities such as Azure Service 
Principals, Azure Managed Identities and Google Service 
Accounts.

You can enable any number of workload identity providers for one 
or more organizations. When you enable a Workload Identity Provider in an 
|service| organization, you can use it in all the projects in that 
organization for database access.

|service| supports |workload| on only dedicated {+clusters+} (M10 and above) 
running MongoDB version 7.0.11 and above, and only by selected drivers.

To learn more about implementing {+workload+} access with your chosen
driver, see :ref:`oauth-supported-drivers`.

How it Works
-------------

|workload| allows your applications access to MongoDB 
{+clusters+} with OAuth2.0 access tokens. The access tokens can be issued by 
any external Identity Provider including Azure Entra ID and Google Cloud 
Platform. |service| stores the user identifiers and privileges, but 
not the secrets. This authentication mechanism for your applications 
is only supported by MongoDB drivers. Other MongoDB tools like  
{+mongosh+} and |compass| don't support this authentication mechanism.

MongoDB Drivers support two types of authentication flow for |workload|: 
Built-in Authentication and Callback Authentication. 

Built-in Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use built-in authentication if you deploy your application on a 
supported infrastructure with a supported principal type. Your application 
can access |service| {+clusters+} without supplying a password or 
manually requesting a |jwt| from your cloud provider's metadata service. Instead, 
your chosen MongoDB driver uses your existing principal identifier to request a 
JWT access token under the hood, which is then passed to the |service| {+cluster+}
automatically when your application connects. 

For more implementation details, see :ref:`your chosen Driver's documentation <oauth-supported-drivers>`.

Callback Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use callback authentication with any service supporting OAuth2.0 
access tokens. {+workload+} calls a callback method, in which you can request 
the required |jwt| from your authorization server or cloud provider that you must 
pass when your application connects to |service| with |workload|. 

Please review :ref:`your chosen driver's <oauth-supported-drivers>` documentation for additional 
implementation details. 

Procedures
----------

To configure MongoDB's {+workload+}:

1. :ref:`Configure Workload Identity Provider (one-time setup) <set-up-in-cloud-provider>`.
   
   a. Configure your external identity provider.
   b. Configure Workload Identity Provider in |service| and 
      enable it for your |service| organization(s).

2. :ref:`Grant external identities (service principals) or groups access to MongoDB {+clusters+} <configure-wif-in-atlas>`.
3. :ref:`Connect your application to {+service+} with a MongoDB Driver <oauth-supported-drivers>`.

Prepare Your External Identity Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Azure
      :tabid: azure-oauth

      In order to access MongoDB |service| {+clusters+} with Azure Managed Identities 
      or Azure Service Principals, you need to register an Azure Entra ID 
      application. If you have an existing application registration for 
      :ref:`Workforce <oidc-authentication-workforce>` (human user) access, we recommended that you register a separate 
      application for Workload access.

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Register an application.

            1. Navigate to :guilabel:`App registrations`.

               a. In your `Azure portal <https://portal.azure.com/>`__ account, search and click :guilabel:`Microsoft Entra ID`.

               b. In the :guilabel:`Manage` section of the left navigation, click :guilabel:`App registrations`.
           
            2. Click :guilabel:`New registration`.

            3. Apply the following values.

               .. list-table::
                  :header-rows: 1
                  :widths: 20 40

                  * - Field
                    - Value

                  * - :guilabel:`Name`
                    - :guilabel:`Atlas Database - Workload`

                  * - :guilabel:`Supported Account Types`
                    - :guilabel:`Accounts in this organizational directory only (single tenant)`

                  * - :guilabel:`Redirect URI`
                    - :guilabel:`Web`

         .. step:: (Optional) Add groups claim.

            It is a best practice to use service principal identifiers as MongoDB user 
            identifiers while defining access rights in Atlas. If you plan to 
            use this common approach, skip this step. However, if you prefer to use 
            group identifiers such as Azure AD Security Group identifier 
            instead, you can set groups claim in your application registration 
            with below steps.


            1. Navigate to :guilabel:`Token Configuration`.

               In the :guilabel:`Manage` section of the left navigation,
               click :guilabel:`Token Configuration`.

            2. Click :guilabel:`Add groups claim`.

            3. In the :guilabel:`Edit groups claim` modal, select :guilabel:`Security`.

               What groups you select depend on the type of groups you configured
               in your Azure environment. You may need to select a different
               type of group to send the appropriate group information.

            4. In the :guilabel:`Customize token properties by type` section, ensure that you only select :guilabel:`Group ID`.

               When you select :guilabel:`Group Id`, Azure sends the
               security group's Object ID.

            5. Click :guilabel:`Add`.

               To learn more about adding a group claim, see `Azure Documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-fed-group-claims>`__.

         .. step:: Enable an Application ID URI.

            1. Navigate to :guilabel:`Expose an API` 
               in the left sidebar and enable Application ID URI.
            
            2. Enable an Application ID URI.
             
               a. Keep the default Application ID URI assigned by Azure, 
                  which is ``<application_client_id>``. Copy and store this value, 
                  as MongoDB Atlas and all MongoDB drivers require this value 
                  for |workload| configuration.

         .. step:: Update the manifest.

            1. In the :guilabel:`Manage` section of the left navigation, click :guilabel:`Manifest`.

            2. Update the :guilabel:`requestedAccessTokenVersion` from ``null`` to ``2``.

               The number ``2`` represents Version 2 of Microsoft's access
               tokens. Other applications can use this as a signed
               attestation of the Active Directory-managed user's identity.
               Version 2 ensures that the token is a JSON Web Token that
               MongoDB understands.
              
            3. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

            To learn more about adding an optional claim, see `Azure Documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest>`__.

         .. step:: Remember metadata.

            1. In the left navigation, click :guilabel:`Overview`.
              
               Copy the :guilabel:`Application (client) ID` value.
     
            2. In the top navigation, click :guilabel:`Endpoints`.
                 
               Copy the :guilabel:`OpenID Connect metadata document` value 
               without the ``/.well-known/openid-configuration`` part.

               You can also retrieve this value by following the
               :guilabel:`OpenID Connect metadata document` |url| and
               copying the value for ``issuer``.

            The following table shows what these Microsoft Entra ID UI values map to in our |service| Configuration Properties:
           
            .. list-table::
               :header-rows: 1

               * - :guilabel:`OpenID Connect metadata document (without /.well-known/openid-configuration)`
