=========================================
Configure a Non-Voting Replica Set Member
=========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You may choose to change the number of votes that each member has in
:ref:`elections <replica-set-elections>` for :term:`primary`. In general, all
members should have only 1 vote to prevent intermittent ties, deadlock,
or the wrong members from becoming :term:`primary`. Use :ref:`replica
set priorities <replica-set-node-priority>` to control which members
are more likely to become primary.

To disable a member's ability to vote in elections, use the following
command sequence in the :program:`mongo` shell.

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[3].votes = 0
   cfg.members[4].votes = 0
   cfg.members[5].votes = 0
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

This sequence gives ``0`` votes to the fourth, fifth, and sixth
members of the set according to the order of the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members` array in the output of
:method:`rs.conf()`.  This setting allows the set to elect these
members as :term:`primary` but does not allow them to vote in
elections. If you have three non-voting members, you can add three
additional voting members to your set. Place voting members so that
your designated primary or primaries can reach a majority of votes in
the event of a network partition.

.. note::

   In general and when possible, all members should have only 1 vote. This
   prevents intermittent ties, deadlocks, or the wrong members from
   becoming primary. Use :ref:`Replica Set Priorities
   <replica-set-node-priority>` to control which members are more
   likely to become primary.
