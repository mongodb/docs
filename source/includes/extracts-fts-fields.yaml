ref: fts-field-analyzer
content: |

  Specify the :ref:`analyzer <analyzers-ref>` to use for indexing the 
  collection data. By default, |fts| uses the :ref:`standard 
  <ref-standard-analyzer>` analyzer (``"lucene.standard"``).
---
ref: fts-field-search-analyzer
content: |

  Specify the :ref:`analyzer <analyzers-ref>` to use when parsing data 
  for the |fts| queries. By default, |fts| uses the :ref:`standard 
  <ref-standard-analyzer>` analyzer (``"lucene.standard"``).

ref: fts-field-ui-mappings-dynamic
content: |

  Specify dynamic or static mapping of fields. To disable dynamic 
  mapping, set ``"dynamic":`` to ``Off``. By default, dynamic mapping 
  is enabled. If you disable dynamic mapping, you must specify the 
  fields to index. To learn more about dynamic and static mappings, 
  see :ref:`ref-index-definitions`.
---
ref: fts-field-json-mappings-dynamic
content: |

  Specify dynamic or static mapping of fields. To disable dynamic 
  mapping, set ``"dynamic":`` to ``false``. By default, dynamic 
  mapping is enabled. If you disable dynamic mapping, you must specify 
  the fields to index. To learn more about dynamic and static mappings, 
  see :ref:`ref-index-definitions`.

ref: fts-field-mappings-fields-vib

  Required if dynamic mapping is disabled. 
  
  To add the fields to index, you must specify the following settings 
  for each field:
        
  - :guilabel:`Field name` - Name of the field to index.
  - :guilabel:`Enable Dynamic Mapping` - Static or dynamic mapping to 
    use. If you disable dynamic mapping, the data in the field isn't 
    automatically indexed.
  - :guilabel:`Store Original Value` - Flag to store field on |fts|.
    This is enabled by default if :guilabel:`Store Full Document` is
    enabled. However, you can toggle the setting to :guilabel:`Off` to 
    exclude the field from storage. To learn more about storing fields,
    see :ref:`fts-stored-source-definition`.
  - :guilabel:`Data Type Configuration` - Field data type. To learn 
    more about the supported data types and their options, see 
    :ref:`bson-data-chart` and :ref:`bson-data-types`.

ref: fts-stored-source-vib
content: |

  Specify whether to store entire documents on |fts|. If this is
  enabled, |fts| stores all the fields in the documents by default. You
  can exclude specific fields from storage on |fts| in the
  :guilabel:`Field Mappings` definition for the fields. To learn more
  about storing fields, see :ref:`fts-stored-source-definition`.

---
ref: fts-stored-source-json
content: |

  Specify the fields in the documents to store on |fts| for query-time 
  lookups. To learn more about storing fields, see 
  :ref:`fts-stored-source-definition`.

ref: fts-field-synonyms-vib
content: |

  Specify synonym mappings to use in your index. To learn more, 
  see :ref:`synonyms-ref`.  

  To add synonym mappings, you must specify the following settings for 
  each synonym:

  - :guilabel:`Synonym mapping name` - Label that identifies the 
    synonym mapping to refer to at query time. You must specify a 
    unique value. You can't specify an empty string value. 
  - :guilabel:`Synonym source collection` - Label that identifies the 
    MongoDB collection in the same database as the |fts| index. 
    Documents in this collection use the format described in the 
    :ref:`synonyms-coll-spec`. You can also add an empty collection or 
    load a sample collection.
  - :guilabel:`Analyzer` - Label that identifies the :ref:`analyzer 
    <analyzers-ref>` to use with this synonym mapping. 

    .. include:: /includes/fact-field-synonym-analyzer.rst

    You can specify any |fts| analyzer except the following 
    :ref:`Language analyzers <ref-language-analyzers>`:

    - ``lucene.kuromoji`` 
    - ``lucene.cjk``

    :ref:`Custom analyzer <custom-analyzers>` tokenizers and token 
    filters: 

    - :ref:`nGram <ngram-tokenizer-ref>` Tokenizer
    - :ref:`edgeGram <edgegram-tokenizer-ref>` Tokenizer
    - :ref:`daitchMokotoffSoundex <daitchmokotoffsoundex-tf-ref>`
