  If you haven't already done so, use `the connection URI form
  <https://docs-mongodbcom-staging.corp.mongodb.com/docs-tutorials/skersch/Guides/guides/server/drivers.html#craft-a-uri-to-connect-to-mongodb>`__ 
  to construct the connection string required for this guide.

  .. note:: Even if you used `the connection URI form
     <https://docs-mongodbcom-staging.corp.mongodb.com/docs-tutorials/skersch/Guides/guides/server/drivers.html#craft-a-uri-to-connect-to-mongodb>`__
     and you see your fields populated in the code example, 
     you will still need to provide the password in the 
     URI string, through the ``mongo`` prompt, or through the Compass connect interface.

  Now you are ready to create your first document in MongoDB.

  MonogDB stores documents as BSON, a binary form of ``JSON``. JSON
  stands for ``JavaScript Object Notation``, and it's a great way to
  store rich data. You don't need to worry about BSON right now, MongoDB
  handles the conversion from your text JSON documents to BSON for you.
  
  MongoDB documents are stored in groups called collections. Like SQL
  tables,  you can have many collections in a database. Unlike SQL
  tables, collections can be fluid. If you want to store some new fields
  for your existing data, you can do that without doing any operations
  on the collection other than inserting the data.

  .. note:: While MongoDB does support dynamic collection definitions,
     if you wish you can be stricter about your data structure and use a
     *schema*, or data definition document, to enforce the structure of
     your data.
