Overview
--------

This page describes the changes you might need to make to your
application when you upgrade the {+driver-short+} to version 2.x.

How to Upgrade
--------------

Each section of this page lists the potential breaking changes introduced by a driver version.
To upgrade the {+driver-short+} to version 2.x, follow these steps:

1. Review the :ref:`Compatibility <csharp-compatibility-tables>` page to ensure the new
   driver version is compatible with the {+mdb-server+} versions your application connects
   to and the .NET or {+framework+} version your application runs on.

#. Address any breaking changes between the driver version your
   application uses and your target upgrade version in the
   :ref:`Breaking Changes by Version <csharp-breaking-changes-v2>` section.

   .. example::
    
      If you are upgrading the driver from v2.14 to v2.21, address all breaking changes
      from the version after v2.14 (v2.19), including any changes for v2.21.

Breaking Changes by Version
---------------------------

The following sections describe the potential breaking changes introduced by each driver
version. If a driver version is not included in this section, it doesn't introduce any
breaking changes.

.. _csharp-breaking-changes-2.28.0:

Version 2.28.0 Breaking Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The driver uses strong naming for all driver components. If your
  application has dependencies that reference multiple {+driver-short+} versions, you
  must create binding redirects, as shown in the following example:

  .. code-block:: csharp

     <configuration>
         <runtime>
             <assemblyBinding xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1">
                 <dependentAssembly>
                     <assemblyIdentity name="MongoDB.Driver"
                                       publicKeyToken="94992a530f44e321"
                                       culture="neutral" />
                     <bindingRedirect oldVersion="2.28.0.0"
                                      newVersion="<version number to use>" />
                 </dependentAssembly>
                 <dependentAssembly>
                     <assemblyIdentity name="MongoDB.Bson"
                                       publicKeyToken="94992a530f44e321"
                                       culture="neutral" />
                     <bindingRedirect oldVersion="2.28.0.0"
                                      newVersion="<version number to use>" />
                 </dependentAssembly>
                 <dependentAssembly>
                     <assemblyIdentity name="MongoDB.Driver.Core"
                                       publicKeyToken="94992a530f44e321"
                                       culture="neutral" />
                     <bindingRedirect oldVersion="2.28.0.0"
                                      newVersion="<version number to use>" />
                 </dependentAssembly>
             </assemblyBinding>
         </runtime>
     </configuration>

.. _csharp-breaking-changes-2.21.0:

Version 2.21.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The driver changes the signature of ``Render`` methods in the Atlas Search builders.
  In previous driver versions, these methods had the following signature:

  .. code-block:: csharp

     Render(IBsonSerializer<TDocument> documentSerializer, IBsonSerializerRegistry serializerRegistry);

  In version 2.21.0 and later, the ``Render`` methods have the following signature:
  
  .. code-block:: csharp

     Render(SearchDefinitionRenderContext<TDocument> renderContext);

.. _csharp-breaking-changes-2.19.0:

Version 2.19.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``ObjectSerializer`` only allows deserialization of
  types that are considered safe. If not specified otherwise, the
  ``ObjectSerializer`` uses the types returned by
  ``ObjectSerializer.DefaultAllowedTypes``.

  To learn more about the ``ObjectSerializer``, visit the
  :ref:`FAQ <csharp-faq-object-serializer>`. For more information on
  ``DefaultAllowedTypes``, visit the `API Documentation
  <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.19/apidocs/html/P_MongoDB_Bson_Serialization_Serializers_ObjectSerializer_DefaultAllowedTypes.htm>`__.

- The default ``LinqProvider`` has been changed to LINQ3. The ``LinqProvider``
  can be configured for LINQ2 in ``MongoClientSettings`` as shown in the
  following code example:

  .. code-block:: csharp

     var connectionString = "<connection string>";
     var clientSettings = MongoClientSettings
        .FromConnectionString(connectionString);
     clientSettings.LinqProvider = LinqProvider.V2;
     var client = new MongoClient(clientSettings);

  If your application uses the LINQ3 provider, you can't use ``-1`` to represent the
  :manual:`positional operator </reference/operator/update/positional/#mongodb-update-up.->`
  when updating an array. To learn how to use the positional operator, see
  :ref:`Update One <csharp-update-one-arrays>` and
  :ref:`Update Many <csharp-update-many-arrays>`.

Version 2.14.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The driver drops support for {+mdb-server+} v3.4 and earlier. You must upgrade
  your {+mdb-server+} to v3.6 or later.

  To learn how to upgrade your {+mdb-server+} deployment, see
  :manual:`Release Notes </release-notes/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
  To learn more about compatibility between the {+driver-short+}
  and {+mdb-server+}, see the
  :ref:`Compatibility <csharp-compatibility-tables>` page.

- The driver drops support for {+framework+} v4.5.2 and earlier. Your application must use
  {+framework+} v4.7.2 or later, .NET Core 2.x or later, or .NET 5 or later.

  To learn more about compatibility between the {+driver-short+}
  and .NET, see the
  :ref:`Compatibility <csharp-compatibility-tables>` page.

- The driver drops support for .NET Standard v1.5. Your application must use .NET
  Standard v2.0 or later.
