Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about how the {+driver-short+} handles conversions
between BSON and Rust types. The process of converting a Rust type to
BSON is called **serialization**, while the reverse process is called
**deserialization**.

The Rust language uses a static type system, but BSON has a dynamic
schema. To handle conversions between Rust types and BSON, the driver and the
`bson <https://crates.io/crates/bson>`__ crate integrate functionality
from the **Serde framework**.

.. tip::
   
   The ``bson`` crate is exported with the ``mongodb`` crate. To learn how
   to install  the ``serde`` crate, see `serde <https://crates.io/crates/serde>`__
   at the ``crates.io`` crate registry.

By implementing functionality from the ``serde`` crate into your
application, you can use custom Rust types such as structs and enums
to model your data.

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Generic Type Parameter <rust-generic-param>` describes
  collection parameterization and data modeling

- :ref:`Custom Data Model <rust-custom-data-model>` describes how to
  define custom Rust types to model data in your collections

- :ref:`Custom Serialization <rust-custom-serialization>` describes how
  to modify default serialization and deserialization behavior by using
  attributes and provides examples

- :ref:`Additional Information <rust-serialization-addtl-info>`
  provides links to resources and API documentation for types
  and methods mentioned in this guide

.. _rust-generic-param:

Generic Type Parameter
----------------------

When you create a ``Collection`` instance, you must specify a generic
type parameter to represent the type of data that models the documents
in your collection. To learn more about specifying a generic type parameter,
see the :ref:`Collection Parameterization section
<rust-coll-parameterization>` of the guide on Databases and Collections.

We recommend that you define and use a custom type to model your
collection's data instead of using the ``Document`` type.

.. _rust-custom-data-model:

Custom Data Model
-----------------

You can use any Rust data type that implements the ``Serialize`` and
``Deserialize`` traits from the ``serde`` crate as the generic type
parameter for a ``Collection`` instance. To implement the ``Serialize``
and ``Deserialize`` traits, you must include the following ``derive``
attribute before defining a Rust type:

.. code-block:: rust
   
   #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]

Custom Struct Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code defines a sample ``Article`` struct that implements
the ``serde`` serialization traits:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/serialization.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-struct
   :end-before: end-struct

.. tip:: Vector Type

   Starting in ``bson`` library v2.14, you can use the
   `bson::binary::Vector <{+bson-api+}/binary/enum.Vector.html>`__ type
   to represent vectors of numeric values.

   Since this type is serialized as a BSON binary vector, usage of
   ``Vector`` can improve storage efficiency. To learn more, see the
   `BSON specification <https://bsonspec.org/spec.html>`__.

The following code accesses the ``articles`` collection with
the ``Article`` struct as its generic type parameter:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/serialization.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-access-coll
   :end-before: end-access-coll

Because the ``Collection`` instance is parameterized with the
``Article`` struct, you can perform CRUD operations with this type.
The following code inserts an ``Article`` instance into the collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/serialization.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-insert-struct
   :end-before: end-insert-struct

Multiple Parameterizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your collection contains multiple schemas, you can define a custom
type to model each data type and create clones of the original
``Collection`` instance for each type. You can create clones of a
``Collection`` instance by using the ``clone_with_type()`` method.

Suppose you originally parameterized a collection with a struct
called ``Square``, but you later realize that you want to insert a different
type of data, modeled by the ``Circle`` struct, into the collection.
The following code parameterizes a collection with the ``Square`` type,
then creates a clone of the collection that is parameterized with the
``Circle`` type:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/serialization.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-multiple-types
   :end-before: end-multiple-types

.. _rust-custom-serialization:

Custom Serialization
--------------------

You can modify the default serialization and deserialization behavior of
the {+driver-short+} by using **attributes** from the ``serde`` crate.
Attributes are optional pieces of metadata attached to fields of
structs or variants of enums.

The ``serde`` crate provides the ``serialize_with`` and
``deserialize_with`` attributes, which take helper functions as values.
These helper functions customize serialization and deserialization on
specific fields and variants. To specify an attribute on a field,
include the attribute before the field definition:

.. code-block:: rust
   
   #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
   struct MyStruct {
       #[serde(serialize_with = "<helper function>")]
       field1: String,
       // ... other fields
   }

In the following sections, you can find examples that use helper
functions from the ``bson`` library to achieve common serialization tasks. To
see a full list of these helper functions, see the `serde_helpers API
documentation <https://docs.rs/bson/latest/bson/serde_helpers/index.html#functions>`__.

Serialize a String as an ObjectId
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might want to represent the ``_id`` field in a document as a
hexadecimal string in your struct. To convert the hexadecimal string to
the ``ObjectId`` BSON type, use the
``serialize_hex_string_as_object_id`` helper function as the value of
the ``serialize_with`` attribute. The following example attaches the
``serialize_with`` attribute to the ``_id`` field so that the driver
serializes the hexadecimal string as an ``ObjectId`` type:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/serialization.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-hex-to-objectid
   :end-before: end-hex-to-objectid

To see how the driver serializes a sample ``Order`` struct to BSON,
select from the following :guilabel:`Struct` and :guilabel:`BSON` tabs:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Struct
      :tabid: order struct

      .. code-block:: rust
         :copyable: false
         :emphasize-lines: 2
         
         let order = Order {
             _id: "6348acd2e1a47ca32e79f46f".to_string(),
             item: "lima beans".to_string(),
         };

   .. tab:: BSON
      :tabid: serialized bson

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false
         :emphasize-lines: 2

         {
           "_id": { "$oid": "6348acd2e1a47ca32e79f46f" },
           "item": "lima beans"
         }

Serialize a DateTime as a String
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might want to represent a ``DateTime`` field value in a document as
an ISO-formatted string in BSON. To specify this conversion, use the
``serialize_bson_datetime_as_rfc3339_string`` helper function as the value of
the ``serialize_with`` attribute attached to the field with a
``DateTime`` value. The following example attaches the
``serialize_with`` attribute to the ``delivery_date`` field so that the
driver serializes the ``DateTime`` value to a string:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/serialization.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-dt-to-string
   :end-before: end-dt-to-string

To see how the driver serializes a sample ``Order`` struct to BSON,
select from the following :guilabel:`Struct` and :guilabel:`BSON` tabs:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Struct
      :tabid: order struct

      .. code-block:: rust
         :copyable: false
         :emphasize-lines: 3
         
         let order = Order {
             item: "lima beans".to_string(),
             delivery_date: DateTime::now(),
         };

   .. tab:: BSON
      :tabid: serialized bson

      .. code-block:: json
         :copyable: false
         :emphasize-lines: 4

         {
           "_id": { ... },
           "item": "lima beans",
           "delivery_date": "2023-09-26T17:30:18.181Z"
         }

Serialize a u32 as an f64
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might want to represent a ``u32`` field value in a document as
an ``f64``, or ``Double``, type in BSON. To specify this conversion, use the
``serialize_u32_as_f64`` helper function as the value of
the ``serialize_with`` attribute attached to the field with a ``u32``
value. The following example attaches the
``serialize_with`` attribute to the ``quantity`` field so that the
driver serializes the ``u32`` value to a ``Double`` type:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/serialization.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin-u32-f64
   :end-before: end-u32-f64

.. note::
   
   The BSON ``Double`` representation of a ``u32`` value appears
   the same as the original value.

Other Attributes and Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to helper functions, the ``bson`` library provides modules
that handle both serialization and deserialization. To select a module
to use on a specific field or variant, set the value of the ``with``
attribute to the name of the module:

.. code-block:: rust
   
   #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
   struct MyStruct {
       #[serde(with = "<module>")]
       field1: u32,
       // ... other fields
   }

For a full list of these modules, see the `serde_helpers API
documentation <https://docs.rs/bson/latest/bson/serde_helpers/index.html#modules>`__.

The ``serde`` crate provides many other attributes to customize
serialization. The following list describes some common attributes and
their functionality:

- ``rename``: serialize and deserialize a field with a specified name instead of the
  Rust struct or variant name
- ``skip``: do not serialize or deserialize the specified field
- ``default``: if no value is present during deserialization, use the
  default value from ``Default::default()``

For a full list of ``serde`` attributes, see the `serde Attributes
API Documentation <https://serde.rs/attributes.html>`__.
