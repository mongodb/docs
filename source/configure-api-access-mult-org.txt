.. include:: /includes/steps-configure-paying-organization.rst

Grant Project Access to your Organizations
------------------------------------------

To manage projects in all your organizations, you need to grant each organization programmatic access to the projects. You can use service accounts or |api| keys. To learn about service accounts versus |api| keys, see :ref:`programmatic-access`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Service Account
      :tabid: serviceaccount

      Repeat the steps to :ref:`create a service account <create-project-api-key>` 
      for each project. The service account you create for a project gets
      automatically added to the parent organization with the permission :authrole:`Organization Member`. 

   .. tab:: API Key
      :tabid: apikey

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Create an |api| key for each organization.

            Repeat the steps to :ref:`create an API key for an organization 
            <create-org-api-key>` for each organization.

         .. step:: Invite the organization key to each project within the organization.

            For each project within an organization, 
            :ref:`invite the related organization key 
            <invite-org-app-api-keys>`.
