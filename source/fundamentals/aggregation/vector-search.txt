Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to perform searches on your documents
by using the Atlas Vector Search feature. The {+driver-short+} allows you to
perform Atlas Vector Search queries by using the aggregation framework.
To learn more about performing aggregations, see the
:ref:`rust-aggregation` guide.

.. note:: Deployment Compatibility

   You can use the Atlas Vector Search feature only when
   you connect to MongoDB Atlas clusters. This feature is not
   available for self-managed deployments.

To learn more about Atlas Vector Search, see the :atlas:`Atlas Vector
Search Overview </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>`.

.. note:: Atlas Search

   To perform advanced full-text search on your documents, you can use the
   Atlas Search feature. To learn about this feature, see the
   :atlas:`Atlas Search Overview </atlas-search/atlas-search-overview/>`.

Atlas Vector Search Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can perform Atlas Vector Search queries, you must create an
Atlas Vector Search index on your collection. To learn more about
creating this index, see the :ref:`rust-atlas-search-indexes` guide.

Vector Search Aggregation Stage
-------------------------------

To create a ``$vectorSearch`` stage in your aggregation pipeline, perform the
following actions:

1. Create a vector to store the pipeline stages.

#. Specify the ``$vectorSearch`` operator and provide details about the
   vector search query.

You must define the following fields in your ``$vectorSearch`` stage:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``index``
     - string
     - Name of the vector search index

   * - ``path``
     - string
     - Field that contains vector embeddings

   * - ``queryVector``
     - array of numbers
     - Vector representation of your query

   * - ``limit``
     - number
     - Number of results to return

Atlas Search Query Examples
---------------------------

In this section, you can learn how to perform Atlas Vector
Search queries. The examples in this section use sample data from the
``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` collection. To learn how to load this
sample data, see the :atlas:`Load Data into Atlas </sample-data/>`
tutorial in the Atlas documentation.

Basic Vector Search Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code performs an Atlas Vector Search query on the
``plot_embedding`` vector field by using a query vector that represents
the term *time travel*:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/aggregation/vector-search.rs
      :language: rust
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-basic-query
      :end-before: end-basic-query

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      { "plot": "A reporter, learning of time travelers visiting 20th century disasters, tries to change the history they know by averting upcoming disasters.", "title": "Thrill Seekers" }
      { "plot": "At the age of 21, Tim discovers he can travel in time and change what happens and has happened in his own life. His decision to make his world a better place by getting a girlfriend turns out not to be as easy as you might think.", "title": "About Time" }
      { "plot": "Hoping to alter the events of the past, a 19th century inventor instead travels 800,000 years into the future, where he finds humankind divided into two warring races.", "title": "The Time Machine" }
      { "plot": "After using his mother's newly built time machine, Dolf gets stuck involuntary in the year 1212. He ends up in a children's crusade where he confronts his new friends with modern techniques...", "title": "Crusade in Jeans" }
      { "plot": "An officer for a security agency that regulates time travel, must fend for his life against a shady politician who has a tie to his past.", "title": "Timecop" }

.. tip:: Query Vector Type

   The preceding example creates an instance of
   ``bson::binary::Vector``, introduced in ``bson`` v2.14,
   to serve as the query vector. You can also use a ``vec`` of
   numbers as a query vector, but we recommend that you use the
   ``Vector`` type to improve storage efficiency.

Vector Search Score
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code performs the same query as in the preceding example,
but outputs only the ``title`` field and ``vectorSearchScore`` meta
field, which describes how well the document matches the query vector:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/aggregation/vector-search.rs
      :language: rust
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-score-query
      :end-before: end-score-query
      :emphasize-lines: 15

   .. output::
      :language: json
      :visible: false

      { "title": "Thrill Seekers", "score": 0.9332504272460938 }
      { "title": "About Time", "score": 0.9312690496444702 }
      { "title": "The Time Machine", "score": 0.9295310378074646 }
      { "title": "Crusade in Jeans", "score": 0.9290415048599243 }
      { "title": "Timecop", "score": 0.9283164739608765 }

Vector Search Options
---------------------

You can use a ``$vectorSearch`` stage to perform many types of Atlas
Vector Search queries. Depending on your desired query, you can specify the
following options in the stage definition:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 40 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Optional Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
     - Default Value

   * - ``exact``
     - boolean
     - Specifies whether to run an Exact Nearest Neighbor (``true``) or
       Approximate Nearest Neighbor (``false``) search
     - ``false``

   * - ``filter``
     - document
     - Specifies a pre-filter for documents to search on
     - No filtering

   * - ``numCandidates``
     - number
     - Specifies the number of nearest neighbors to use during the
       search
     - No limit

To learn more about these options, see the :atlas:`Fields
</atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage/#fields>` section of the
``$vectorSearch`` operator reference in the Atlas documentation.
