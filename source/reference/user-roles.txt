       For an :authrole:`Organization Member`, within a project, the
       user has the privileges as determined by the user's
       :ref:`project role <project-roles>`. If a user's project role is
       :authrole:`Project Owner`, then the user can
       add a new user to the project, which results in adding the
       newly-added user to the organization as well (if the newly added
       user is not already in the organization).

       .. COMMENT
          In Atlas, Data Access Admin does not have access to real time metrics tab, so can't actually get to the screen to kill.  As such, will not mention the killOp privilege in Atlas. Mention only in CloudMgr/OpsMgr docs.
