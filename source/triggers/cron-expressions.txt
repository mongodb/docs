CRON expressions are user-defined strings that use standard 
`cron job <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron>`__ syntax 
to define when a :ref:`scheduled trigger <scheduled-triggers>`
should execute. Whenever all of the fields in a CRON expression
match the current date and time, |service| fires the trigger
associated with the expression.

Expression Syntax
-----------------

Format
~~~~~~

CRON expressions are strings composed of five space-delimited fields.
Each field defines a granular portion of the schedule on which its
associated trigger executes::

   * * * * *
   │ │ │ │ └── weekday...........[0 (SUN) - 6 (SAT)]
   │ │ │ └──── month.............[1 (JAN) - 12 (DEC)]
   │ │ └────── dayOfMonth........[1 - 31]
   │ └──────── hour..............[0 - 23]
   └────────── minute............[0 - 59]

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 25 60
   
   * - Field
     - Valid Values
     - Description
   
   * - ``minute``
     - [0 - 59]
     - Represents one or more minutes within an hour.
       
       .. example::
          
          If the ``minute`` field of a CRON expression has a value of
          ``10``, the field matches any time ten minutes after the hour
          (e.g. ``9:10 AM``).
   
   * - ``hour``
     - [0 - 23]
     - Represents one or more hours within a day on a 24-hour clock.
       
       .. example::
          
          If the ``hour`` field of a CRON expression has a value of
          ``15``, the field matches any time between ``3:00 PM`` and
          ``3:59 PM``.
   
   * - ``dayOfMonth``
     - [1 - 31]
     - Represents one or more days within a month.
       
       .. example::
          
          If the ``dayOfMonth`` field of a CRON expression has a value
          of ``3``, the field matches any time on the third day of the
          month.
   
   * - ``month``
     - | ``1  (JAN)``   ``7  (JUL)``
       | ``2  (FEB)``   ``8  (AUG)``
       | ``3  (MAR)``   ``9  (SEP)``
       | ``4  (APR)``   ``10 (OCT)``
       | ``5  (MAY)``   ``11 (NOV)``
       | ``6  (JUN)``   ``12 (DEC)``
     - Represents one or more months within a year.
       
       A month can be represented by either a number (e.g. ``2`` for
       February) or a three-letter string (e.g. ``APR`` for April).
       
       .. example::
          
          If the ``month`` field of a CRON expression has a value of
          ``9``, the field matches any time in the month of September.
   
   * - ``weekday``
     - | ``0 (SUN)``
       | ``1 (MON)``
       | ``2 (TUE)``
       | ``3 (WED)``
       | ``4 (THU)``
       | ``5 (FRI)``
       | ``6 (SAT)``
     - Represents one or more days within a week.
       
       A weekday can be represented by either a number (e.g. ``2`` for a
       Tuesday) or a three-letter string (e.g. ``THU`` for a Thursday).
       
       .. example::
          
          If the ``weekday`` field of a CRON expression has a value of
          ``3``, the field matches any time on a Wednesday.

Field Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each field in a CRON expression can contain either a specific value or
an expression that evaluates to a set of values. The following table
describes valid field values and expressions:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Expression Type
     - Description

   * - | **All Values**
       | (``*``)
     - Matches all possible field values.
       
       Available in all expression fields.
       
       .. example::
          
          The following CRON expression schedules a trigger to execute
          once every minute of every day:
          
          .. code-block:: text
             
             * * * * *
   
   * - | **Specific Value**
       | (``<Value>``)
     - Matches a specific field value. For fields other than ``weekday``
       and ``month`` this value will always be an integer. A ``weekday``
       or ``month`` field can be either an integer or a three-letter
       string (e.g. ``TUE`` or ``AUG``).
       
       Available in all expression fields.
       
       .. example::
          
          The following CRON expression schedules a trigger to execute
          once every day at 11:00 AM UTC:
          
          .. code-block:: text
             
             0 11 * * *

   * - | **List of Values**
       | (``<Expression1>,<Expression2>,...``)
     
     - Matches a list of two or more field expressions or specific
       values.
       
       Available in all expression fields.
       
       .. example::
          
          The following CRON expression schedules a trigger to execute
          once every day in January, March, and July at 11:00 AM UTC:
          
          .. code-block:: text
          
             0 11 * 1,3,7 *
   
   * - | **Range of Values**
       | (``<Start Value>-<End Value>``)
     - Matches a continuous range of field values between and including
       two specific field values.
       
       Available in all expression fields.
       
       .. example::
          
          The following CRON expression schedules a trigger to execute
          once every day from January 1st through the end of April at
          11:00 AM UTC:
          
          .. code-block:: text
             
             0 11 * 1-4 *

   * - | **Modular Time Step**
       | (``<Field Expression>/<Step Value>``)
     - Matches any time where the step value evenly divides the
       field value with no remainder (i.e. when ``Value % Step == 0``).
       
       Available in the ``minute`` and ``hour`` expression fields.
       
       .. example::

          The following CRON expression schedules a trigger to execute
          on the 0th, 25th, and 50th minutes of every hour:

          .. code-block:: text

             */25 * * * *
