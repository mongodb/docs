The "Settings" section of the MMS console enables users to personalize
their console and activate or deactivate a variety of features. The
following sections correspond to a tab on the Settings page.

My Settings
-----------

These settings are specific to the logged in user, and will only affect 
their MMS experience.

Personalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Personalization` page allows users to configure the console 
to suit their needs and preferences. 

- **Chart Refresh**: sets the rate at which the data displayed in the
  charts on your dashboards or on the "Hosts Statistics" page refreshes.

- **Default Dashboard**: sets the default dashboard on the "Dashboard"
  page. You can select from a list of all of your dashboards.

- **Homepage**: sets which page of the MMS console you will see when
  you log into MMS. You can choose from the "Hosts" page, or the
  "Dashboard" page.

- **Page Shown When Switching Groups** sets which page of the MMS
  console you will see when you select a different group. You can
  select the "Hosts" page or the "Dashboard" page. Alternatively,
  select "Current" and MMS will not change pages when you select a
  different group.

- **Separate Opcounter Charts**: allows you to control the presentation
  of Opcounter Charts. If enabled, MMS charts each opcounter type
  separately. Otherwise, each opcounter type is overlaid together in a
  single chart.

- **Display Chart Annotations**: toggles the presence of chart
  annotations. Chart annotations overlay information about significant
  system events on the charts. For example, with chart annotations MMS
  will draw a red vertical line over the charts.

- **User Time Zone**: sets your local time zone.

- **User Language**: allows you to select the language the MMS Console 
  will display in.

- **User Date Format**: allows you to select your preferred
  date format.

- **Email Notifications** allows you to opt-in to, or opt-out of
  receiving 10gen's e-mail newsletters about MMS.

Group Settings
--------------

These settings are general settings that apply to all users in a given
group.

General Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Log Data Collection For All Hosts**: activates or deactivates the
  collection of log data for all hosts. This overwrites the statuses
  set on the individual hosts. MMS displays log data in the "Logs" tab
  of the "Host Statistics" page.

- **Group Time Zone**: sets your group's time zone. 

- **Exposed DB Host Check**: when active, MMS will periodically
  try to connect to your MongoDB instances. If your configuration is
  secure, this should fail. If the attempt is successful, MMS sends you
  an alert.

- **DB Stats**: allows you to enable or disable the collection of database
  statistics. For more information, see ":ref:`How does MMS gather database
  statistics? <db-stats-warning>`".

Preferred Hostnames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames` allows you to specify the hostname to
use for servers with multiple aliases. This prevents servers from
appearing multiple times under different names.

Duplicate Hostnames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`Duplicate Hostnames` allows you to reset and remove all
detected duplicate hosts. This is useful if your server environment
has drastically changed and you believe a host is incorrectly marked
as a duplicate.

API Key
~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`API Key` displays the MMS API Key for your MMS group. Keep
this key private. Use the API key to support :ref:`automated agent
installation <automated-agent-installation>`.

Secret Key
~~~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`Secret Key` displays the MMS Secret Key for your
group. Keep this key private. Use the Secret key to support
:ref:`automated agent installation <automated-agent-installation>`.

MMS Agent
~~~~~~~~~

:guilabel:`MMS Agent` provides links for downloading the
pre-configured MMS agent in both .zip and tar.gz formats. It also
provides links to download the unconfigured agent for :ref:`automated
agent installation <automated-agent-installation>`.

   Backup and Restore Service Settings
   -----------------------------------

   The following settings will only be visible to users of the MongoDB
   Backup and Restore Service.

   Backup Agent
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :guilabel:`Backup Agent` provides links for downloading the
   pre-configured Backup agent in both .zip and tar.gz formats, on a
   variety of platforms. The :doc:`MongoDB Backup and Restore Service
   </backup>` requires this agent.

   Two-Factor Authentication
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Two-Factor Authentication is only used with :doc:`MongoDB Backup
   and Restore Service </backup>`. Two-Factor Authentication enables
   you to configure the service to require two-factor
   authentication. To enable two-factor authentication, click on
   "Set", and then input your mobile phone number. You will receive an
   SMS text message with an authentication code the MMS interface will
   prompt you for when you complete the setup.

   .. includes:: /includes/fact-two-factor-auth-India-limit.rst

   Backup and Restore Public Key
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :guilabel:`Backup and Restore Private Key` enables users who have
   signed up for the :doc:`MongoDB Backup and Restore Service
   </backup>` to generate a new public key that MMS will use to
   connect via SSH and transmit a snapshot of your data.
