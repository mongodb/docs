title: Configure the package management system (``yum``).
stepnum: 1
level: 4
ref: config-yum
pre: |
  Create a ``/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-{+version+}.repo`` file so that
  you can install MongoDB directly using ``yum``:
action:
  language: cfg
  code: |
    [mongodb-org-{+version+}]
    name=MongoDB Repository
    baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/{{distro_name}}/{{distro_release}}/mongodb-org/{+version+}/x86_64/
    gpgcheck=1
    enabled=1
    gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-{+pgp-version+}.asc
post: |
    You can also download the ``.rpm`` files directly from the
    {{distro_link}}. Downloads are organized by {{distro_name_full}}
    version (e.g. ``{{distro_num}}``), then MongoDB
    :doc:`release version </reference/versioning>`
    (e.g. ``{+version+}``), then architecture (e.g. ``x86_64``).
    Odd-numbered MongoDB release versions, such as
    ``{+version-dev+}``, are development versions and are
    unsuitable for production deployment.
replacement:
  distro_name: "redhat"
  distro_link: "`MongoDB repository <https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/>`_"
  distro_release: "$releasever"
  distro_name_full: "Red Hat / CentOS"
  distro_num: "7"

title: Install the MongoDB packages.
stepnum: 2
level: 4
ref: install
# pre: |
#   When you install the packages, you choose whether to install the current
#   release or a previous one. This step provides the commands for both.
action:
  - pre: |
      To install the latest stable version of MongoDB, issue the following
      command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo yum install -y {+package-name-org+}
  - pre: |
      Alternatively, to install a specific release of MongoDB, specify each
      component package individually and append the version number to the
      package name, as in the following example:

      .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-to-version-yum.rst
  - pre: |
      You can specify any available version of MongoDB. However ``yum``
      upgrades the packages when a newer version becomes available. To
      prevent unintended upgrades, pin the package. To pin a package, add
      the following ``exclude`` directive to your ``/etc/yum.conf`` file:
    language: ini
    code: |
      exclude=mongodb-org,mongodb-org-server,mongodb-org-shell,mongodb-org-mongos,mongodb-org-tools
...
