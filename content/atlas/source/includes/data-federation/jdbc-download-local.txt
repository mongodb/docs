Hardware Requirements
-------------------------

The MongoDB |jdbc| driver has no hard system requirements. Any
system capable of running a modern SQL tool (such as Tableau) is capable of running the
MongoDB JDBC driver.

Software Requirements
-------------------------

The MongoDB JDBC driver is compatible with:

- Windows x86_64

- macOS x86_64 and macOS aarch64 architectures

- linux x86_64 and linux arm64 architectures

Dependencies

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Download the MongoDB JDBC Driver JAR file.

      You can choose between two versions of the file:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 30 30

         * - Version
           - Description
         * - `JDBC All JAR file
             <https://translators-connectors-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/eap/mongo-jdbc-driver-eap/mongodb-jdbc-eap-3.0.0-beta-all.jar>`_.
           - Needed for Tableau and DBeaver.
         * - `JDBC JAR file
             <https://translators-connectors-releases.s3.amazonaws.com/eap/mongo-jdbc-driver-eap/mongodb-jdbc-eap-3.0.0-beta.jar>`_
           - Needed for JetBrains. 

   .. step:: Install and Configure the JDBC Driver.

      Copy the JAR file to the appropriate directory for your SQL tool. For example, to
      install the JDBC driver for Tableau on macOS, copy the file to
      ``~/Library/Tableau/Drivers``.
