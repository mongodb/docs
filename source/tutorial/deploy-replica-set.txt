====================
Deploy a Replica Set
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This tutorial describes the process for deploying a three member
:term:`replica set` , with specific instructions for development and
test as well as for production systems.

.. seealso:: ":doc:`/core/replication`" and
   ":doc:`/administration/replication-architectures`" for appropriate
   background.

Overview
--------

For most deployments, a simple 3 node replica set provides a
sufficient redundancy to survive most network partitions and other
system failures. A replica set of this also size provides sufficient
capacity to host many distributed read operations. 

.. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa... Is 10gen really recommending against redundancy?
.. As a SysAd, I personally disagree with this notion; what I typically
.. recommend is absolutely to implement a basic ReplSet in Prod, but not
.. get into Sharding unless you find that it's really necessary.

While MongoDB's replica set functionality provides a great deal of flexibility 
and specific definable node behaviors or types, it's best to avoid this
additional complexity until your application requires the functionality.



Requirements
------------

Three distinct systems, so that each system can run its own instance
of :program:`mongod`. For development systems you may run all three 
instances of the :program:`mongod` process on a local system. (e.g. a 
laptop) or within a virtual instance. For production environments, you 
should endeavor to maintain as much separation between the nodes.  For
instance: Deploy replica set members on distinct hardware, and on 
systems that draw power from different circuits, to the greatest extent 
possible.

Procedure
---------

This procedure assumes that you already have instances of MongoDB
installed on all systems that you hope to have as members of your
replica set. If you have not already installed MongoDB, see the
:ref:`installation tutorials <tutorials-installation>`.

Development and Test Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Begin by starting three instances of :program:`mongod`. For ephemeral
tests and the purposes of this guide, you may run the :program:`mongod`
instances in separate windows of GNU Screen. OS X and most Linux
distributions come with screen installed by default [#screen]_
systems.

Issue the following command to create the necessary data directories:
::

     mkdir -p /srv/mongodb/rs0-0 /srv/mongodb/rs0-1 /srv/mongodb/rs0-2

Issue the following commands, each in a distinct screen window: ::

     mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /srv/mongodb/rs0-0 --replSet rs0
     mongod --port 27018 --dbpath /srv/mongodb/rs0-1 --replSet rs0
     mongod --port 27019 --dbpath /srv/mongodb/rs0-2 --replSet rs0

These command start members of a replica set named ``rs0``, each
running on a distinct port. Alternatively, if you are already using these
ports, you can select different ports. See the documentation of the
following options for more information: :option:`--port <mongod --port>`,
:option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`, and :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`.

.. note::

   If you're running each :program:`mongod` instance on a distinct
   system, you can omit the :option:`--port <mongod --port>`
   option. You will also need to specify the :option:`--bind_ip
   <mongod --bind_ip>` option.

Connect to the mongod instance with the :program:`mongo` shell to the 
first host. If you're accessing this command remotely, replace 
"localhost" with the approriate hostname.  Open a new terminal session
and enter the following: ::

      mongo localhost:27017

Issue the following shell function to initiate a replica set
consisting of the current node, using the default configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.initiate()

Use the following shell function to display the current :doc:`replica
configuration </reference/replica-configuration>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.conf()

Now, issue the following sequence of commands to add two nodes to the
replica set.

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.add("localhost:27018")
   rs.add("localhost:27019")

Congratulations, after these commands return you will have a fully
functional replica set. Within a couple moments the new replica set 
should successfully elect a :term:`primary` node.

At any time, you may check the status of your replica set with the 
:func:`rs.status()` command.

See the documentation of the following shell functions for more
information: :func:`rs.initiate()`, :func:`rs.conf()`,
:func:`rs.reconfig()` and :func:`rs.add()`.

.. [#screen] `GNU Screen <http://www.gnu.org/screen/>`_ is packaged as
   ``screen`` on Debian-based, Fedira/Red Hat-based, and Arch Linux.

.. seealso:: You may also consider the "`simple setup script
   <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-snippets/blob/master/replication/simple-setup.Pu>`_"
   as an example of a basic automatically configured replica set.

Production Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Production replica sets are very similar to the development or testing
deployment described above, with the following differences:

- Each member of the replica set will reside on it's own machine, and
  the MongoDB processes will all bind to port ``27017`` (the
  standard MongoDB port.)

- All runtime configuration will be specified in :doc:`configuration
  files </reference/configuration-options>` rather than as
  :doc:`command line options </reference/mongod>`.

- Each member of the replica set needs to be accessible by way of
  resolvable DNS or hostnames in the following scheme:

  - ``mongodb0.example.net``
  - ``mongodb1.example.net``
  - ``mongodb2.example.net``

  Configure DNS names appropriately, *or* set up your systems'
  ``/etc/host`` file to reflect this configuration.

Use the following configuration for each MongoDB instance.

.. code-block:: cfg

   port = 27017

   bind_ip = 10.8.0.10

   dbpath = /srv/mongodb/

   fork = true

   replSet = rs0

Modify the :setting:`bind_ip` to reflect a secure interface on
your system that will be able to access all other members of the set
*and* on which all other members of the replica set can access the
current node. The DNS or host names need to point and resolve to this
IP address. Configure network rules or a virtual private network
(i.e. "VPN") to permit this access.

.. TODO: file-based replset 'seed list'
.. The note that was here appeared to reference an example that has
.. changed.  Currently there is very little info on seed lists
.. www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/File+Based+Configuration

Store this file on each system, located at ``/etc/mongodb.conf`` on
the file system. See the documentation of the configuration options
used above: :setting:`dbpath`, :setting:`port`,
:setting:`replSet`, :setting:`bind_ip`, and
:setting:`fork`. Also consider
any additional :doc:`configuration options </reference/configuration-options>`
that your deployment may require.

On each system issue the following command to start the
:program:`mongod` process:

.. code-block:: bash

     mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf

.. note::

   In production deployments you likely want to use and configure a
   :term:`control script` to manage this process based on this
   command. Control scripts are beyond the scope of this document.

Log in with the :program:`mongo` shell to this host using the following
command: ::

      mongo

Issue the following shell function to initiate a replica set
consisting of the current node, using the default configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.initiate()

Use the following shell function to display the current :doc:`replica
configuration </reference/replica-configuration>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.config()

Now, issue the following sequence of commands to add two nodes to the
replica set.

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.add("mongodb1.example.net")
   rs.add("mongodb2.example.net")

Congratulations, after these commands return you will have a fully
functional replica set. You may have to wait several moments for the
new replica set to successfully elect a :term:`primary` node.

.. seealso:: The documentation of the following shell functions for
   more information:

   - :func:`rs.initiate()`,
   - :func:`rs.conf()`,
   - :func:`rs.reconfig()`, and
   - :func:`rs.add()`.
