action:
  pre: |
    Use your :manual:`driver </applications/drivers>` to create a
    :manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string>` that
    specifies the hostname and port of the deployment. The connection
    string for your driver will resemble the following:
  language: "none"
  code: | 
        mongodb://[<username>:<password>@]hostname0<:port>[,hostname1:<port1>][,hostname2:<port2>][...][,hostnameN:<portN>]
post: |
  If you specify a seed list of all hosts in a replica set in the
  connection string, your driver will automatically connect to the
  term:`primary`.

  For standalone deployments, you will only specify a single host. For
  sharded clusters, only specify a single :program:`mongos` instance.
