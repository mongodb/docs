     :guilabel:`Restore History`.

  b. When the restore job completes, click :guilabel:`(get link)`
     for each :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` appears.

  c. Click:

     - The copy button to the right of the link to copy the link to

     - :guilabel:`Download` to download the snapshot immediately.

  .. important:: Extra step for point-in-time restores

     For point-in-time and oplog timestamp restores, additional
     instructions are shown. The final step shows the full command
     you must run using the :abbr:`MBRU (MongoDB Backup Restore
     Utility)`. It includes all of the necessary options to ensure a
     full restore.

     Select and copy the ``mongodb-backup-restore-util`` command
     provided under :guilabel:`Run Binary with PIT Options`.

  #. Start a :manual:`~bin.mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` instance without authentication
     enabled using the extracted snapshot directory as the data
     directory.

     .. example::

        .. code-block:: sh

     .. warning::
        The MongoDB Backup Restore Utility doesn't support
        authentication, so you can't start this temporary database with
        authentication.

  #. Run the MongoDB Backup Restore Utility on your destination host.
     Run it once for the replica set.

     options:
