|service| uses the specified |cidr| block for all other |vpc| peering
connections created in the project. The |service| |cidr| block must be
at least a ``/18`` in one  of the following :rfc:`private networks <rfc1918#section-3>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 40 20

   * - Lower Bound
     - Upper Bound
     - Prefix

   * - ``10.0.0.0``
     - ``10.255.255.255``
     - 10/8

   * - ``172.16.0.0``
     - ``172.31.255.255``
     - 172.16/12

   * - ``192.168.0.0``
     - ``192.168.255.255``
     - 192.168/16

|service| locks this value if an ``M10+`` cluster or a |vpc| peering
connection already exists. To modify the |cidr| block, ensure there are
no ``M10+`` clusters in the project *and* no other |vpc| peering
connections in the project. 

Alternatively, :ref:`create a new project <atlas-create-atlas-project>`
and create a |vpc| Peering Connection to set the desired |service| 
|vpc| |cidr| block for that project.

.. important::

   |service| limits the number of MongoDB nodes per |vpc| based on the
   |cidr| block and the region selected for the project. 

   .. example::
   
               A project with an |service| |vpc| |cidr| block of
               ``/18`` is limited to approximately 80 three-node
               replica sets per |gcp| region.

   Contact :website:`MongoDB Support </contact>` for any questions on
   |service| limits of MongoDB nodes per |vpc|.
