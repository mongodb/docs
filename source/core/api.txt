Overview
--------

The |mms| Public API follows the principles of the REST architectural style to
expose a number of internal resources which enable programmatic access to |mms|'s
features.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/api-principles-pricing.rst

The API has the following features:

JSON entities
  All entities are expressed in JSON.

Digest authentication
  To ensure that your :term:`Public API key` is never sent over the
  network, API requests are authenticated using `HTTP Digest Authentication`_.

Browsable interface
  Using a consistent linking mechanism, you can
  browse the entire API by starting at the root resource and following links to
  related resources.

User Access Control
  Each |mms| user's API capabilities
  match the permissions granted by their
  :doc:`/reference/user-roles`. For example, a user with the
  :authrole:`Project Read Only` role cannot
  modify any resource within that project whether through the
  |mms| UI or the API.

API Network Whitelist
  The |mms| API supports a per-user
  :ref:`API Whitelist <whitelist-for-api-operations>` for
  restricting API access to specific IP or
  :abbr:`CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)` addresses. For |mms|
  users with a non-empty API whitelist, all API access must originate
  from a whitelisted IP address. An empty API whitelist grants access
  to all API endpoints except those that explicitly require whitelisting
  for access.

  |mms| supports requiring API whitelisting at the organization
  level, such that any API activity for projects within that
  organization must originate from an entry on each respective
  |mms| user's API whitelist. To learn more, see
  :ref:`Configure Public API Access <whitelist-for-api-operations>`.

.. only:: cloud

   HTTPS-Only
     You can only access the API via HTTPS, ensuring all
     data sent over the network is fully encrypted using TLS.

.. COMMENT: For Ops Manager, the above sentence about HTTPS may not apply.
   It depends on their server configuration.

HTTP Methods
------------

All resources support a subset of these common HTTP Methods:

- ``GET`` - Retrieve the JSON representation of a resource.

- ``POST`` - Create a new resource using the provided JSON representation.

- ``PUT`` - Replace a resource with the provided JSON representation.

- ``PATCH`` - Update the specified fields in a resource using the provided JSON
  representation.

- ``DELETE`` - Remove a resource.

- ``HEAD`` - Retrieve the response header without the JSON representation of the resource.

JSON
----

All entities are represented in JSON. The following rules and conventions apply:

- When sending JSON to the server via ``POST`` or ``PUT``, make sure to specify
  the correct content type request header: ``Content-Type: application/json``

- Invalid fields will be *rejected* rather than *ignored*. If, for example, you
  attempt to create a new entity and misspell one of the fields, or if you
  attempt to update an existing entity and include a field that cannot be
  modified, the server will respond with a 400 status code and an error message
  stating which field was invalid.

- All dates are returned as `ISO-8601`_ formatted strings designated in UTC.
  When sending dates to the server (ie, as query parameters or fields in
  ``POST`` or ``PATCH`` request entities), use ISO-8601 formatted dates. If you
  do not specify a time zone, UTC is assumed. However, it is highly recommended
  that you include a time zone designator to avoid any ambiguity.

- In some cases, a timestamp will be returned as a `BSON timestamp`_, most
  notably in the backup resources. These are represented in JSON documents
  as an object with two fields: ``date``, an ISO-8601 formatted date string
  in UTC with granularity to the second, and ``increment`` a 32-bit integer.

- Fields that contain numeric values in a particular unit will be named so as to
  disambiguate the unit being used. For example, a host's uptime is returned in
  millseconds, so the name of the host entity field is ``uptimeMsec``.

- Fields that do not have a current value will be returned with an appropriate
  default value. For example, |mms| will not have any statistics for a
  newly discovered host, so any statistics-related fields will have a value of
  zero. Fields that do not have a sensible default value will be omitted from
  the entity. For example, a host that is not using authentication will omit
  the ``username`` field from the returned entity.

- The fields in the JSON documents returned by the server are in no particular
  order, and it may change. Do not depend on the order of the fields.

.. _api-linking:

Linking
-------

Each resource includes one or more links to sub-resources and/or related
resources. For example, a host has a link to the group it belongs to, the
replica set it belongs to, and so on. Links are placed in the ``links`` field
of an entity, which is an array of link relation objects. Each link relation
has two fields:

- ``rel`` - Name (or type) of the relation. Many of these are considered
  Extension Relation Types and will be prefixed by `http://mms.mongodb.com`.

- ``href`` - The target URL.

All entities include at least one link relation called ``self``, which
is simply its own URL. When an entity is part of a list (ie, when requesting
all hosts in a group), then it only includes the ``self`` link relation. Here's
an example of a portion of a **host** resource with a few links:

.. only:: cloud

   .. code:: javascript

      {
        "id": "xxx",
        "groupId": "yyy",
        "hostname": "mongodb.foo.com",
        "port": 27017,
        // additional host properties...
        "links": [
          {
            "rel": "self",
            "href": "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/public/v1.0/groups/xxx/hosts/yyy"
          },
          {
            "rel": "http://mms.mongodb.com/group",
            "href": "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/public/v1.0/groups/xxx"
          }
        ]
      }

.. only:: onprem

   .. code:: javascript

      {
        "rel": "http://mms.mongodb.com/group",
        "href": "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/public/v1.0/groups/xxx"
        "id": "xxx",
        "groupId": "yyy",
        "hostname": "mongodb.foo.com",
        "port": 27017,
        // additional host properties...
        "links": [
          {
            "rel": "self",
            "href": "https://<ops-manager-host>/api/public/v1.0/groups/xxx/hosts/yyy"
          },
          {
            "rel": "http://mms.mongodb.com/group",
            "href": "https://<ops-manager-host>/api/public/v1.0/groups/xxx"
          }
        ]
      }

For more information, refer to the `Web Linking Specification
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988>`_. Note that although the
specification describes a format for including links in the HTTP
response headers, doing so is not a requirement. To make the API
easily browsable, it includes the links in the response body rather
than in the response headers.

.. _api-lists:

Lists
-----

Some resources return a list of entities. For example, you can request a list of
all **hosts** in a **group**. When a list of entities is expected in a response,
the results will be returned in batches bounded by two query parameters:

- ``pageNum`` - Page number (1-based). Defaults to 1 if not specified.

- ``itemsPerPage`` - Maximum number of items to return, up to a maximum of 100.
  Defaults to 100 if not specified.

The response entity contains three fields:

- ``totalCount`` - The total number of items in the entire result set. For
  example, if a group has a total of 57 hosts, and you make a request with
  ``pageNum=6`` and ``itemsPerPage=10``, then ``totalCount`` will be 57.

- ``results`` - The result set, which is an array of entity documents.

- ``links`` - Contains one to three link relations: ``previous`` for the previous
  page of results (omitted for the first page); ``next`` for the next page of
  results (omitted for the last page); ``self`` for the current page (always
  present).

If you make a request for a list of entities and there are no results, then the
API will respond with a 200 status code and the ``results`` array will be empty.
It does *not* respond with a 404 in this case, since the list of entities may
not be empty at some point in the future. However, had you requested a list of
entities in a context that does not exist (i.e., the list of hosts for a
non-existent group), then this *will* result in a 404 response status.

Here's an example response for the second page of 10 hosts in a group with a
total of 57 hosts:

.. code:: javascript

  {

    "totalCount": 57,
    "results": [
      {
        "id": "yyy",
        "groupId": "xxx",
        // additional host properties...
      },
      // additional host documents...
    ],
    "links": [
      {
        "rel" : "self",
        "href" : "https://www.mongodb.com/api/public/v1.0/groups/xxx/hosts?pageNum=2&itemsPerPage=10"
      },
      {
        "rel": "previous",
        "href": "https://www.mongodb.com/api/public/v1.0/groups/xxx/hosts?itemsPerPage=10&pageNum=1"
      },
      {
        "rel": "next",
        "href": "https://www.mongodb.com/api/public/v1.0/groups/xxx/hosts?itemsPerPage=10&pageNum=3"
      }
    ]
  }

.. _api-envelope:

Envelopes
---------

Some clients may not be able to access the HTTP response headers and/or status
code. In that case, you can request that the response include an "envelope,"
which is simply an extra layer of information in the JSON document that contains
any relevant details that would normally be in the response headers. By default,
the API will *not* include the response in an envelope. To request one, simply
add the query parameter ``envelope=true``.

For responses that contain a single entity, the envelope will contain two
fields:

- ``status`` - The HTTP status code.

- ``content`` - The requested entity.

For responses that contain a list of entities, there is already an envelope that
wraps the results, so specifying ``envelope=true`` in this case will only add
the ``status`` field to the existing envelope.


Pretty Printing
---------------

By default, extraneous whitespace is stripped from the JSON returned by the
server. To ask for pretty-printed JSON, simply append the ``pretty=true`` query
parameter to any request:

.. only:: cloud

   .. code-block:: none

      curl -u "username:apiKey" --digest -i "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/public/v1.0?pretty=true"

.. only:: onprem

   .. code-block:: none

      curl -u "username:apiKey" --digest -i "https://<ops-manager-host>/api/public/v1.0?pretty=true"

.. note::

   All the examples in this document show
   pretty-printed JSON for clarity, **although the example URLs do not contain
   this additional query parameter.**

Response Codes
--------------

Responses utilize the standard HTTP response codes, including:

.. list-table::
  :widths: 5 20 75
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Code
    - Meaning
    - Notes

  * - 200
    - OK
    - The request was successful. This is typically the response to a successful
      ``GET`` request.

  * - 201
    - Created
    - A new resource was created. This is typically the response to a
      successful ``POST`` request.

  * - 202
    - Accepted
    - A request for an asynchronous operation was accepted.

  * - 400
    - Bad Request
    - Something was wrong with the client request.

  * - 401
    - Unauthorized
    - Authentication is required but was not present in the request. Typically
      this means that the digest authentication information was omitted from the
      request, the provided credentials are incorrect, or the user associated
      with the given API key is not allowed to access the requested resource.

  * - 403
    - Forbidden
    - Access to the specified resource is not permitted.

  * - 404
    - Not Found
    - The requested resource does not exist.

  * - 405
    - Method Not Allowed
    - The HTTP method is not supported for the specified resource. Keep in mind
      that each resource may only support a subset of HTTP methods. For example,
      you are not allowed to ``DELETE`` the root resource.

  * - 409
    - Conflict
    - This is typically the response to a request to create or modify a property
      of an entity that is unique when an existing entity already exists with
      the same value for that property. For example, attempting to create a group
      with the same name as an existing group is not allowed.

  * - 5xx
    - Various server errors
    - Something unexpected went wrong. Try again later and consider notifying
      |mms| Support.


Errors
------

When a request results in an error, the response body will contain a document
with additional details about what went wrong. The document contains three
fields:

- ``error`` - The error code, which is simply the HTTP status code.

- ``reason`` - A short description of the error, which is simply the HTTP status
  phrase.

- ``detail`` - A more detailed description of the error.

For example, here is the response body for a request for a host that does not
exist:

.. code:: javascript

   {
     "error": 404,
     "reason": "Not Found",
     "detail": "No host exists with ID yyy in group xxx."
   }

For a list of codes, see :doc:`/reference/api-error-codes`.

Authentication
--------------

As previously mentioned, the |mms| API uses HTTP Digest Authentication. The
details of digest authentication are beyond the scope of this document, but it
essentially requires a username and a password which are hashed using a unique
server-generated value called a **nonce**. The username is the username of a
registered |mms| account, and the password is a :term:`Public API key` associated
with that account.

Keep the following points in mind:

- The server-generated nonce is used by the client to hash the username and
  password before sending them back to the server to authenticate a request.
  The nonce is only valid for a short amount of time as per the digest
  authentication specification. This is to prevent replay attacks, so you
  can't cache a nonce and use it forever.

.. only:: cloud

   - Using digest authentication in combination with HTTPS provides an extra layer
     of security by ensuring that a password is never transmitted back to the
     server.

- Some resource methods require even more security and are additionally
  protected by :ref:`whitelists <whitelist-for-api-operations>`
  that allow access to the resource only from the
  IP addresses listed. Each user configures their own whitelist of IP
  addresses that allow access to the resource.

- The |mms| UI has a concept of **roles**, which allow more fine-grained control
  of the operations a user is allowed to perform. The API resources also enforce
  the same authorization rules, so the resources and methods that can be
  accessed by an API key are governed by the roles granted to the associated
  user. For example, to ``DELETE`` a host, the user that owns the API key used
  to make the request must be a ``Monitoring Admin`` or ``Owner``
  in the group that the host belongs to.

.. only:: cloud

   - Many resources are tied to a group, as evidenced by URLs of the form
     ``.../api/public/v1.0/groups/<GROUP-ID>/...``. For these resources, the user tied
     to the API key must be a member of the group. Otherwise the server will
     respond with a 401 error.

.. only:: onprem

   - Many resources are tied to a group, as evidenced by URLs of the form
     ``.../api/public/v1.0/groups/<GROUP-ID>/...``. For these resources, the user tied
     to the API key must be a member of the group *or* must be assigned to one of
     the ``GLOBAL`` roles. Otherwise the server will respond with a 401 error.

.. _api-automation:

Automation
----------

The :doc:`/reference/api/automation-config` and
:doc:`/reference/api/automation-status` resources provide endpoints
that let you modify a group's deployment and retrieve deployment
status. You can modify a deployment by sending a new :doc:`automation
configuration </reference/cluster-configuration>` to |mms|.
The automation configuration is where you describe
and configure the MongoDB processes to be deployed. |mms| refers to this
as the deployment's "goal state." When you submit a new automation
configuration through the API, the Automation Agents adjust the current
state of the system to match the goal state.

.. important:: There is no protection in the API to prevent concurrent modifications.
   If two administrators both start with a configuration based on the
   current version, make their own modifications, and then submit their
   modifications, the later modification wins.

.. only:: cloud

   .. _api-rate-limiting:

   Rate Limiting
   -------------

   Certain resources are subject to rate limiting.

   For resources that are rate
   limited, |mms| will allow up to 100 requests per minute *per group*. Keep in mind
   that an API key is assigned to a user, but that user may access multiple groups.
   Consider two users: A and B. User A belongs to group X, and user B belongs to
   groups X and Y. At 1:00:00pm, User A makes 50 requests to a rate limited
   resource in group X, all of which are complete by 1:00:20pm. At 1:00:30pm,
   User B attempts to make 60 requests to a rate limited resource in group X.
   Since User A has already used up 50 requests within the 1:00pm minute for
   group X, the last 10 requests User B attempts to make will be rejected.
   However, User B can make requests to a rate limited resource in group Y, since
   each group maintains a separate request counter. At 1:01pm, requests to group X
   may proceed, because the request counter used for rate limiting will reset each
   minute.

   If you exceed the rate limit, the API returns a ``429 Too Many Requests``
   response code.
