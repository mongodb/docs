Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to retrieve data from your MongoDB
collections using **read operations**.

Read operations allow you to do the following:

- Retrieve documents from your collections by using :ref:`find operations <golang-retrieve-find>`
- Perform transformations on documents in your collections by using :ref:`aggregation operations <golang-retrieve-aggregation>`

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the following ``Tea`` struct as a model for documents
in the ``tea`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/retrieve.go
   :start-after: start-tea-struct
   :end-before: end-tea-struct
   :language: go
   :dedent:

To run the examples in this guide, load these documents into the
``tea`` collection in the ``db`` database by using the following snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/retrieve.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insert docs
   :end-before: end insert docs

.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/automatic-db-coll-creation.rst

Each document describes the tea variety a customer ordered, their
rating, and the date of the order. These descriptions correspond to the
``item``, ``rating``, and ``date_ordered`` fields.

.. _golang-retrieve-find:

Find Operations
---------------

Use **find operations** to retrieve data from MongoDB. Find operations
consist of the ``Find()`` and ``FindOne()`` methods.

Find All Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Find()`` method expects you to pass a ``Context`` type and a
query filter. The method returns *all* documents that match the filter
as a ``Cursor`` type.

For an example that uses the ``Find()`` method, see the :ref:`golang-find-example`
section of this page. To learn how to access data by using a cursor, see
the :ref:`golang-cursor` guide.

Find One Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``FindOne()`` method expects you to pass a ``Context`` type and a
query filter. The method returns *the first document* that matches the
filter as a ``SingleResult`` type.

For an example that uses the ``FindOne()`` method, see the
:ref:`golang-find-one-example` section of this page. For an example that
uses ``FindOne()`` and queries by using a specific ``ObjectId`` value, see
the :ref:`golang-find-one-by-id` section of this page.

To learn how to access data from a ``SingleResult`` type, see
:ref:`golang-bson-unmarshalling` in the BSON guide.

.. _golang-retrieve-options:

Modify Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of ``Find()`` and ``FindOne()`` by passing
in a ``FindOptions`` and ``FindOneOptions`` type respectively. If you
don't specify any options, the driver uses the default values for each
option.

You can configure the commonly used options in both types with the
following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetCollation()`` 
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.  
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetLimit()`` 
     - | The maximum number of documents to return. 
       | Default: ``0`` 
       | This option is not available for ``FindOneOptions``. The
        ``FindOne()`` method internally uses ``SetLimit(-1)``.

   * - ``SetProjection()`` 
     - | The fields to include in the returned documents. 
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetSkip()`` 
     - | The number of documents to skip.
       | Default: ``0``

   * - ``SetSort()`` 
     - | The field and type of sort to order the matched documents. You can specify an ascending or descending sort.
       | Default: none

.. _golang-find-example:

Find Example
````````````

The following example passes a context, filter, and ``FindOptions`` to
the ``Find()`` method, which performs the following actions:

- Matches documents where the ``rating`` value is between ``5`` and
  ``9`` (exclusive)
- Sorts the matched documents in ascending order by ``date_ordered``
  
.. io-code-block::
  :copyable: true

  .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/retrieve.go
      :start-after: begin find docs
      :end-before: end find docs
      :language: go
      :dedent:

  .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      {"item":"Sencha","rating":7,"date_ordered":"2009-11-18T05:00:00Z"}
      {"item":"Masala","rating":8,"date_ordered":"2009-12-01T05:00:00Z"}

.. _golang-find-one-example:

Find One Example
````````````````

The following example passes a context, filter, and ``FindOneOptions``
to the ``FindOne()`` method, which performs the following actions:

- Matches documents where the ``date_ordered`` value is on or before November
  30, 2009
- Skips the first two matched documents

.. io-code-block::
  :copyable: true

  .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/retrieve.go
      :start-after: begin find one docs
      :end-before: end find one docs
      :language: go
      :dedent:

  .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      {"item":"Masala","rating":9,"date_ordered":"2009-11-12T05:00:00Z"}

.. _golang-find-one-by-id:

Find One by ObjectId Example
````````````````````````````

This example defines an ``id`` variable with a value of type ``ObjectId``
and uses ``id`` to specify a query filter. The filter matches a document
with an ``_id`` field value that corresponds to the ``id`` variable.
This example queries for the following document based on its ``_id`` value:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 2

    {
        _id: ObjectId('65170b42b99efdd0b07d42de'),
        item: "Hibiscus",
        rating : 4,
        date_ordered : 2009-12-18T05:00:00.000+00:00
    }

The following code passes the filter and a ``FindOneOptions`` instance
as parameters to the ``FindOne()`` method to perform the following actions:

- Match the document with the specified ``ObjectId`` value
- Project only the ``Item`` and ``Rating`` fields of the matched document

.. io-code-block::
  :copyable: true

  .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/retrieve.go
      :start-after: begin objectid
      :end-before: end objectid
      :language: go
      :dedent:

  .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      {"item":"Hibiscus","rating":4}

.. note::

   The {+driver-short+} automatically generates a unique ``ObjectId``
   value for each document's ``_id`` field, so your ``ObjectId`` value
   might differ from the preceding code example. For more information
   about the ``_id`` field, see the :ref:`_id Field <golang-insert-id>`
   section of the Insert a Document page.

.. _golang-retrieve-aggregation:

Aggregation Operations
----------------------

Use **aggregation operations** to retrieve and transform data from
MongoDB. Perform aggregation operations using the ``Aggregate()``
method.

Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Aggregate()`` method expects you to pass a ``Context`` type and
an **aggregation pipeline**. An aggregation pipeline defines how to
transform data through stages. Some of the stages are matching
documents, renaming fields, and grouping values.

The method returns the resulting documents in a ``Cursor`` type. If
you omit the :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/#mongodb-pipeline-pipe.-match>`
stage, the pipeline proceeds using all documents in the collection.

To learn how to access data in a cursor, see :ref:`golang-cursor`.

Modify Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Aggregate()`` method optionally takes an ``AggregateOptions``
type, which represents options you can use to modify its behavior. If
you don't specify any options, the driver uses the default values for
each option.

The ``AggregateOptions`` type allows you to configure options with the
following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetAllowDiskUse()`` 
     - | Whether to write to temporary files.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetBatchSize()`` 
     - | The number of documents to return in each batch.  
       | Default: none

   * - ``SetBypassDocumentValidation()`` 
     - | Whether to allow the write to opt-out of document level validation.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetCollation()`` 
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.  
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetMaxTime()`` 
     - | The maximum amount of time that the query can run on the server.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetMaxAwaitTime()`` 
     - | The maximum amount of time for the server to wait on new documents to satisfy a tailable cursor query.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetComment()`` 
     - | An arbitrary string to help trace the operation through the database profiler, currentOp and logs.
       | Default: ``""``

   * - ``SetHint()`` 
     - | The index to use to scan for documents to retrieve.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetLet()`` 
     - | Specifies parameters for the aggregate expression, which improves command readability by separating the variables from the query text.
       | Default: none

Example
```````

The following example passes a context and an aggregation pipeline that
performs the following actions:

- Groups reviews by item ordered
- Calculates the average rating for each item

.. io-code-block::
  :copyable: true

  .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/retrieve.go
      :start-after: begin aggregate docs
      :end-before: end aggregate docs
      :language: go
      :dedent:

  .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Sencha had an average rating of 8.5 
      Hibiscus had an average rating of 4 
      Masala had an average rating of 9
