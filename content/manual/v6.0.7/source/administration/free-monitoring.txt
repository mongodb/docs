.. warning:: Free monitoring is deprecated 

   Free monitoring will be deprecated in April 2023 and decommissioned
   in August 2023. 

   Beginning in April 2023, new users canâ€™t enable free monitoring on
   MongoDB Community instances. Deployments currently using free
   monitoring can continue to access the free monitoring UI until August
   2023.

   You can choose another monitoring option for your deployment:

   - **Deploy a MongoDB Atlas dedicated cluster**. :ref:`Migrate your
     data <live-migration>` to a :ref:`MongoDB Atlas
     <atlas-getting-started>` dedicated cluster sized M10 or greater,
     which includes several advanced monitoring and alerting features:

     - :ref:`Query Profiler <query-profiler>`
     - :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>`
     - :ref:`Real-Time Performance Panel <real-time-metrics-status-tab>`

     Get $100 in Atlas credits by applying the code
     ``FREE-MONITORING-100``. Limited to the first 300 users.

   - **Deploy a MongoDB Atlas free cluster**. A free Atlas cluster includes
     basic monitoring and alerting capabilities. After you
     :atlas:`create a free cluster
     </tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster/>`, use :binary:`mongodump` and
     :binary:`mongorestore` to manually create a backup of your database
     and import your data from your MongoDB Community instance.

   - **Use MongoDB Cloud Manager**. The `MongoDB Cloud Manager
     <https://docs.cloudmanager.mongodb.com/>`_ free tier includes basic
     monitoring capabilities.

.. versionadded:: 4.0

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB (Community Edition) offers free Cloud
monitoring for standalones and replica sets.

Monitored Data
--------------

Free monitoring provides information about your deployment, including:

- Operation Execution Times

- Memory Usage

- CPU Usage

- Operation Counts

The data expires 24 hours after being uploaded. For more information on
the data upload and expiration, see
:ref:`free-monitoring-data-expiration`.

Enable/Disable Free Monitoring
------------------------------

By default, you can enable/disable free monitoring during runtime using
:method:`db.enableFreeMonitoring()` and :method:`db.disableFreeMonitoring()`.

You can also enable or disable free monitoring during
:binary:`~bin.mongod` startup using either:

- the configuration file setting :setting:`cloud.monitoring.free.state`
  or

- the command-line option :option:`--enableFreeMonitoring <mongod --enableFreeMonitoring>`

Once you enable free monitoring, it remains enabled until you disable
it.

To view the state of your free monitoring, 

- Use the :method:`db.getFreeMonitoringStatus()` method.

- The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` and the helper
  :method:`db.serverStatus()` also includes free monitoring statistics
  in the :serverstatus:`freeMonitoring` field.

Access Control
--------------

When running with access control, the user must have the following
privileges to enable free monitoring and get status:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { resource: { cluster : true }, actions: [ "setFreeMonitoring", "checkFreeMonitoringStatus" ] }

The built-in role :authrole:`clusterMonitor` role provides this
privilege.

.. _free-monitoring-data-expiration:

Monitored Data and Expiration
-----------------------------

When enabled, the monitored data is uploaded periodically. The
monitored data expires after 24 hours. That is, you can only access
monitored data that has been uploaded within the past 24 hours.

If you disable free monitoring and later re-enable free monitoring, you
can access your previous metrics that have not expired within the past
24 hours.

Monitoring URL
--------------

When you enable free monitoring, you are provided with a unique
URL where you can access your monitored data.

.. important::

   Anyone with whom you share this unique URL can access your monitored
   data.
