msgid "MongoDB supports :doc:`replica sets </replication>`, which can have up to :ref:`50 nodes <3.0-replica-sets-max-members>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/faq/replica-sets.txt:29
msgid "MongoDB also supports master-slave replication; however, replica sets are the recommended replication topology. However, if your deployment requires more than 50 nodes, you must use master/slave replication."

#: ../source/faq/replica-sets.txt:105
msgid "Yes."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/faq/replica-sets.txt:38
msgid "For example, a deployment may maintain a :term:`primary` and :term:`secondary` in an East-coast data center along with a :term:`secondary` member for disaster recovery in a West-coast data center."

#: ../source/faq/replica-sets.txt:47
msgid "Yes, but not without connection failures and the obvious latency."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/faq/replica-sets.txt:49
msgid "Members of the set will attempt to reconnect to the other members of the set in response to networking flaps. This does not require administrator intervention. However, if the network connections among the nodes in the replica set are very slow, it might not be possible for the members of the node to keep up with the replication."

msgid "Why use journaling if replication already provides data redundancy?"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/faq/replica-sets.txt:60
msgid ":term:`Journaling <journal>` facilitates faster crash recovery. Prior to journaling, crashes often required :dbcommand:`database repairs <repairDatabase>` or full data resync. Both were slow, and the first was unreliable."

#: ../source/faq/replica-sets.txt:64
msgid "Journaling is particularly useful for protection against power failures, especially if your replica set resides in a single data center or power circuit."

#: ../source/faq/replica-sets.txt:68
msgid "When a :term:`replica set` runs with journaling, you can safely restart :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances without additional intervention."

#: ../source/faq/replica-sets.txt:73
msgid "Journaling requires some resource overhead for write operations. Journaling has no effect on read performance, however."

#: ../source/faq/replica-sets.txt:94
msgid "See the documentation for :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for more information. As with all MongoDB components, run arbiters on secure networks."

msgstr ""

#: ../source/faq/replica-sets.txt:107
msgid "Factors including: different oplog sizes, different levels of storage fragmentation, and MongoDB's data file pre-allocation can lead to some variation in storage utilization between nodes. Storage use disparities will be most pronounced when you add members at different times."
