ref: fts-field-search-analyzer
content: |

  Specify the :ref:`analyzer <analyzers-ref>` to use when parsing data

ref: fts-field-ui-mappings-dynamic
content: |

  Specify dynamic or static mapping of fields. To disable dynamic 
  mapping, set ``"dynamic":`` to ``Off``. By default, dynamic mapping 
  is enabled. If you disable dynamic mapping, you must specify the 
  fields to index. To learn more about dynamic and static mappings, 
  see :ref:`ref-index-definitions`.

ref: fts-field-json-mappings-dynamic
content: |

  Specify dynamic or static mapping of fields. To disable dynamic 
  mapping, set ``"dynamic":`` to ``false``. By default, dynamic 
  mapping is enabled. If you disable dynamic mapping, you must specify 
  the fields to index. To learn more about dynamic and static mappings, 
  see :ref:`ref-index-definitions`.

ref: fts-field-mappings-fields-vib

  Required if dynamic mapping is disabled. 
  
  To add the fields to index, you must specify the following settings 
  for each field:
        
  - :guilabel:`Field name` - Name of the field to index.
  - :guilabel:`Enable Dynamic Mapping` - Static or dynamic mapping to 
    use. If you disable dynamic mapping, the data in the field isn't 
    automatically indexed.
  - :guilabel:`Store Original Value` - Flag to store field on |fts| for 
    query-time lookups. This is enabled by default if :guilabel:`Store 
    Full Document` is enabled. However, you can toggle the setting to 
    :guilabel:`Off` to exclude the field from storage. To learn more 
    about storing fields, see :ref:`fts-stored-source-definition`.

    .. note::

  - :guilabel:`Data Type Configuration` - Field data type. To learn 
    more about the supported data types and their options, see

  Specify whether to store entire documents on |fts| for query-time 
  lookups. If this is enabled, |fts| stores all the fields in the 
  documents by default. You can exclude specific fields from storage on 
  |fts| in the :guilabel:`Field Mappings` definition for the fields. To 
  learn more about storing fields, see 
  :ref:`fts-stored-source-definition`.
