title: "Deploy a new replica set for each shard."
stepnum: 1
ref: deploy-replica-sets
content: |
  For each shard, deploy a new replica set:

  #. Start a new :binary:`~bin.mongod` for each member of the replica set.
     Include any other configuration as appropriate.

  #. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` to *one* of the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
     instances. In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

     a. Run :method:`rs.initiate()`.

     b. Use :method:`rs.add()` to add the other members of the replica set.

stepnum: 2
ref: deploy-config-servers

  To deploy config servers as replica set (CSRS), see
  :ref:`sharding-setup-start-cfgsrvr`.
---
title: "Start the ``mongos`` instances."
stepnum: 3
ref: deploy-mongos
content: |
  Start the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, specifying the new config
  servers with ``--configdb``. Include any other configuration as
  appropriate.

  For sharded clusters with CSRS, see
  :ref:`sharding-setup-start-mongos`.

title: "Add shards to the cluster."
stepnum: 4
ref: add-shards
content: |
  Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.
  Use :method:`sh.addShard()` to add each replica sets as a shard. 

  For detailed instructions in adding shards to the cluster, see
  :ref:`sharding-setup-add-shards`.

title: "Shut down the ``mongos`` instances."
stepnum: 5
ref: shutdown-mongos
content: |
  Once the new sharded cluster is up, shut down all :binary:`~bin.mongos`
  instances.
---
title: "Restore the shard data."
stepnum: 6
ref: restore-shard-data
pre: |
  For each shard, use :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` to restore the data dump
  to the primary's data directory. Include the ``--drop`` option to
  drop the collections before restoring and, because the :doc:`backup
  procedure </tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps>`
  included the :option:`--oplog` option, include the
  :option:`--oplogReplay` option for :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`.
action:
  pre: |
    For example, on the primary for ShardA, run the
    :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`. Specify any other configuration as
    appropriate.
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongorestore --drop --oplogReplay /data/dump/shardA
post: |
  After you have finished restoring all the shards, shut down all shard
  instances.

title: "Restore the config server data."

  - pre: |
      To restore to a :ref:`config server replica set <csrs>`, run
      :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` against the primary of the CSRS. 
      Include the ``--drop`` option to drop the collections before
      restoring and, because the :doc:`backup procedure
      </tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps>` included
      the :option:`--oplog` option, include the :option:`--oplogReplay`
      option for :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`.
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongorestore --drop --oplogReplay /data/dump/configData
  - pre: |
      If restoring to three mirrored config servers instead, for each
      config server, use :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` to restore the data
      dump to each config server's data directory. Include the
      ``--drop`` option to drop the collections before restoring and,
      because the :doc:`backup procedure
      </tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps>` included
