The Aggregation Pipeline Builder in |compass| helps you create
:manual:`aggregation pipelines </core/aggregation-pipeline/>` to process
documents from a collection or view and return computed results.

About this Task 
---------------

|compass| provides different modes to create aggregation pipelines:

- Stage View Mode, a visual pipeline editor that preloads pipeline syntax based 
  on your selected stages.

- Stage Wizard, a feature of Stage View Mode that provides a set of templates 
  for simple aggregation stage use cases. The Stage Wizard only includes 
  simple use cases to help you get started with your aggregation pipeline.

- Focus Mode, a feature of Stage View Mode where you edit one pipeline stage 
  at a time. Focus Mode helps you manage complex or deeply nested aggregation 
  pipeline stages.

- Text View Mode, a text-based pipeline editor that accepts raw
  pipeline syntax. 

Before You Begin
----------------

To build an aggregation pipeline, choose a collection and click the
:guilabel:`Aggregations` tab. |compass-short| displays a blank
aggregation pipeline. The :guilabel:`Preview of Documents in the
Collection` section shows 10 documents randomly sampled from the chosen
collection.

.. note:: Atlas Search Stages

   When you connect to a MongoDB deployment hosted on 
   `Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_compass>`_,
   Atlas-only stages :atlas:`$search </reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/#-search>` 
   and :atlas:`$searchMeta </reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/#-searchmeta>`
   become available in the Aggregation Pipeline Builder. Use these stages 
   to perform :atlas:`full-text search</atlas-search/atlas-search-overview>` 
   on Atlas collections.

Steps
-----

To see how to create an aggregation pipeline, select the tab corresponding to 
your chosen view mode:

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Stage View Mode 
      :tabid: stage 

      .. procedure:: 
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Stages` view
            
            In the aggregation pipeline pane, ensure the 
            :guilabel:`{} Stages` toggle switch is selected.

            .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-stageview-toggle-on.png
               :figwidth: 300 px
               :alt: Toggle on stage view mode 

         .. step:: Add an aggregation stage
            
            At the bottom of the aggregation pipeline pane, click the 
            :guilabel:`+ Add Stage` button.
            
         .. step:: Select an aggregation pipeline stage
            
            On the upper-left corner of the aggregation stage card, 
            click the :guilabel:`Select` drop-down menu and select the 
            :manual:`aggregation pipeline stage 
            </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>` to use for the first 
            stage of the pipeline. 

         .. step:: Fill in your pipeline stage
            
            Fill in your selected stage. You can adjust the width of the 
            pipeline stage by dragging its border to the right.

            .. note::
               
               .. include:: /includes/shared/fact-agg-pipeline-preview-toggle.rst 
               
               For example, the following pipeline excludes the first 
               :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage 
               and only includes the 
               :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project/>`
               stage:
               
               .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-exclude-stage-example.png 
                  :alt: Aggregation Builder exclude stage example
         
         .. step:: Add additional pipeline stages
            
            To add an additional pipeline stage after your last aggregation 
            stage, click :guilabel:`Add Stage`. To add an aggregation stage 
            before your most recently added stage, click the :guilabel:`+` icon 
            above the stage card. 
            
            Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each additional stage.

            .. note:: 

               You can change the order of pipeline stages by dragging 
               the header of each stage card.

         .. step:: Run the pipeline
            
            At the top-right corner of the pipeline builder, click 
            :guilabel:`Run`. |compass-short| returns your results in the 
            document view. 

            .. warning::

               .. include:: /includes/shared/fact-agg-pipeline-merge-out-confirm.rst

   .. tab:: Stage Wizard 
      :tabid: wizard 

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal
         
         .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Stages` view
            
            In the aggregation pipeline pane, ensure the 
            :guilabel:`{} Stages` toggle switch is selected.

            .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-stageview-toggle-on.png
               :figwidth: 300 px
               :alt: Toggle on stage view mode 

         .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`Stage Wizard` card
            
            To the right of the view mode toggle, click the wand icon to open 
            the :guilabel:`Stage Wizard` card.

            .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-stage-wizard.png
               :figwidth: 300 px
               :alt: Click the icon to the right of the view mode toggle.

         .. step:: (Optional) Search for an aggregation use case

            On the :guilabel:`Stage Wizard` card, you can filter the
            use cases by searching for keywords associated with the use case or
            aggregation stage. 

         .. step:: Select an aggregation pipeline stage use case

            On the :guilabel:`Stage Wizard` card, select a stage use 
            case for the first stage of your pipeline. You can click the stage 
            card to add it to the end of your pipeline or drag it to your 
            preferred position. 
            
            After you select a use case, |compass-short| populates the stage 
            card with a form that corresponds to the selected aggregation 
            pipeline stage.

            The Stage Wizard use cases include the following aggregation stages:

            - :pipeline:`$group`

            - :pipeline:`$lookup`

            - :pipeline:`$match`
            
            - :pipeline:`$project`
            
            - :pipeline:`$sort`

         .. step:: Fill in your pipeline stage

            Fill in the form for your selected stage and click 
            :guilabel:`Apply`. After you click :guilabel:`Apply`, the form will 
            turn into a stage card that you can edit in Stage View Mode, Focus 
            Mode, or Text View Mode. 

            |compass-short| populates the Stage Output with up to ten sample 
            output documents.

            .. note:: 

               You cannot edit an existing stage through the Stage Wizard. The 
               Stage Wizard can only add new stages. To edit an existing stage, 
               use Stage View Mode, Focus Mode, or Text View Mode.

         .. step:: Add additional pipeline stages

            To add more aggregation stages to your pipeline, repeat steps 3 
            and 4 for each additional stage. 
            
            .. tip:: 
               You can change the order of pipeline stages by dragging the 
               header of each stage card. 

         .. step:: Run the pipeline

            At the top-right corner of the pipeline builder, click 
            :guilabel:`Run`. |compass-short| returns your results in the 
            document view.

   .. tab:: Focus Mode 
      :tabid: focus 

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal
         
         .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Stages` view
            
            In the aggregation pipeline pane, ensure the 
            :guilabel:`{} Stages` toggle switch is selected.

            .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-stageview-toggle-on.png
               :figwidth: 300 px
               :alt: Toggle on stage view mode 

         .. step:: Add an aggregation stage
            
            If you have not already created an aggregation stage, click the 
            :guilabel:`+ Add Stage` button at the bottom of the aggregation 
            pipeline pane.

         .. step:: Open Focus Mode
            
            On the upper-right corner of the stage card, click the 
            Focus Mode icon.

         .. step:: Select an aggregation pipeline stage
            
            Click the :guilabel:`Select` drop-down menu and select the 
            :manual:`aggregation pipeline stage 
            </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>` to use for the first 
            stage of the pipeline. 

         .. step:: Fill in your pipeline stage 

            Fill in your selected  stage. |compass-short| populates the 
            :guilabel:`Stage Output` with up to ten sample output documents. 

            You can adjust the width of the :guilabel:`Stage Input`, stage 
            editor, and the :guilabel:`Stage Output` by dragging their border to 
            the desired size.

            .. note:: 

               .. include:: /includes/shared/fact-agg-pipeline-preview-toggle.rst

         .. step:: Add additional pipeline stages
            
            Click the :guilabel:`Add Stage` dropdown to add additional 
            aggregation stages before or after your last aggregation stage. 
            Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each additional stage.

            You can add stages with the following keyboard shortcuts: 

            - To add a stage after the current stage: 

              - Windows / Linux: :guilabel:`Ctrl + Shift + A`

              - Mac: :guilabel:`⌘ + Shift + A`
            
            - To add a stage before the current stage: 
              
              - Windows / Linux: :guilabel:`Ctrl + Shift + B`

              - Mac: :guilabel:`⌘ + Shift + B` 

         .. step:: Navigate between stages
            
            To navigate between different stages, select the stage you 
            want to edit from the :guilabel:`Stage` dropdown in the upper-left 
            corner of the Focus Mode modal. 

            You can navigate between stages with the following keyboard 
            shortcuts: 

            - To go to the stage before the current stage: 

              - Windows / Linux: :guilabel:`Ctrl + Shift + 9`

              - Mac: :guilabel:`⌘ + Shift + 9`
            
            - To add a stage before the current stage: 
              
              - Windows / Linux: :guilabel:`Ctrl + Shift + 0`

              - Mac: :guilabel:`⌘ + Shift + 0` 

         .. step:: Run the pipeline
            
            Click :guilabel:`x` to exit Focus Mode and select 
            :guilabel:`Run` at the top right of the pipeline builder. 
            |compass-short| returns your results in the document view. 

   .. tab:: Text View Mode 
      :tabid: text 

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal
         
         .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Text` view
            
            In the aggregation pipeline pane, click the 
            :guilabel:`</> Text` toggle switch to enable text mode for pipeline 
            editing.
            
            .. figure:: /images/compass/agg-builder-textview-toggle-on.png

               :alt: Toggle textmode on
         
         .. step:: Enter your aggregation pipeline
            
            Enter valid aggregation syntax into the text editor. The text 
            editor provides real-time linting for correct syntax and debugging 
            information.

            You can also use Text View Mode to import aggregation pipelines from 
            plain text by typing or pasting your pipeline into the text editor.
            
            For example, following pipeline limits the query results to ``4`` 
            documents.
            
            .. code-block:: javascript
               
               [ { "$limit" : 4 } ]
               
            .. note:: 
               
               To expand all embedded fields and documents within the preview 
               results, click :guilabel:`Output Options` and select 
               :guilabel:`Expand all fields`.
