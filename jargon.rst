10gen Jargon Conventions
========================

MongoDB
-------

Refer to MongoDB as "MongoDB" rather than mongo or Mongo when referring
to the entire database system, including possibly ``mongod`` and
``mongos``.

Refer to ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` to indicate the database process, or
server instance itself.

Data Structures
---------------

*document* refers to "rows," or records in a MongoDB
 database. Potential confusion with "JSON Documents."

*field* refers to a "key" or "identifier" of data within a MongoDB
 document.

*value* refers to the contents of a *field*.
