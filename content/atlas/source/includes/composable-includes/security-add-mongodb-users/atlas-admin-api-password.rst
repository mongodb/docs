Create database users to provide clients access to the {+database-deployments+} in your
project. 

A database user's access is determined by the roles assigned
to the user. When you create a database user, any of the :ref:`built-in roles <atlas-user-privileges>` 
add the user to all {+database-deployments+} in your |service| project. 
To specify which resources a database user can access in your project, you 
can select the option :guilabel:`Restrict Access to Specific Clusters` in the {+atlas-ui+}
or set :ref:`specific privileges <atlas-specific-privileges>`
and :ref:`custom roles <mongodb-roles>`.

Database users are separate from |service| users. Database users have
access to MongoDB databases, while |service| users have access to the
|service| application itself. |service| supports creating temporary
database users that automatically expire within a user-configurable
7-day period.

   You must use the :atlascli:`{+atlas-cli+} 
   </command/atlas-dbusers-create/>`, 
   :oas-bump-atlas-tag:`{+atlas-admin-api+} <database-users>`, 
   {+atlas-ui+}, or a supported :ref:`integration 
   <partner-integrations>` to add, modify, or delete database users on 
   |service| {+database-deployments+}. Otherwise, |service| rolls back 
   any user modifications.

:ref:`SCRAM <authentication-scram>` is MongoDB's
default authentication method. SCRAM requires a password for
each user.

Database User Authentication
----------------------------

The :ref:`authentication database <user-authentication-database>` for
SCRAM-authenticated users is the ``admin`` database.

.. note::

    By default, Atlas supports SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication. 
    If you have any database users created before the release of 
    MongoDB 4.0, update their passwords to generate SCRAM-SHA-256
    credentials. You may reuse existing passwords.

Required Access
---------------

To add database users, you must have
:authrole:`Organization Owner`, :authrole:`Project Owner`, or 
:authrole:`Project Database Access Admin` access to |service|.


Add Database Users
------------------

You can add database users through the {+atlas-admin-api+}. The 
options you specify determine the authentication method. To learn 
more, see :oas-bump-atlas-op:`Create One Database User 
<createdatabaseuser>`.


View Database Users and Certificates
------------------------------------

To view |service| database users using the 
{+atlas-admin-api+}, see :oas-bump-atlas-op:`Get All
<listdatabaseusers>`.


Modify Database Users
---------------------

You can update database users through the {+atlas-admin-api+}. To 
learn more, see :oas-bump-atlas-op:`Update One 
<updatedatabaseuser>`.


Delete Database Users
---------------------

You can delete database users through the {+atlas-admin-api+}. To 
learn more, see :oas-bump-atlas-op:`Delete One 
<deletedatabaseuser>`.
