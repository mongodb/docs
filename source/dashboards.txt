Dashboards are a collection of charts assembled to create a single
unified display of your data. Each chart shows data from a
single MongoDB collection or view, so dashboards are essential to
attain insight into multiple focal points of your data in a single
display. Dashboards can be shared with other users.

Each dashboard shows the following information:

- Title

- A preview of the first three charts in the dashboard, including the
  chart title and type
- When the dashboard was last modified

By default, the most recently modified dashboards are shown first in
the list. You can change the sort order by using the
:guilabel:`Sort By` dropdown menu.

Add a Sample Dashboard
----------------------

|charts| provides several sample dashboards that use various sample 
data sources. You can add a sample dashboard to explore different 
examples of charts you can create.

.. tip::
   
   You can add a new sample dashboard even if you have an existing 
   sample dashboard in your |charts-short| project. This can be useful 
   if you have changed a sample dashboard and want a fresh copy.

To add a sample dashboard:

.. procedure:: Create a Sample Dashboard
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: From the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page, 
      expand the :guilabel:`Add Dashboard` dropdown menu and select :guilabel:`Add sample dashboard`. 

   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Add sample dashboard` modal, 
      select a category of sample data with which to create a sample dashboard. 
      You can choose from the following sample dashboards: 

      - `Product event metadata <https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-embedding-examples-wgffp/public/dashboards/63f6f973-045a-4862-83f4-514e7d2df8fc?ajs_event=Link%20from%20Charts%20docs&ajs_prop_referrer=https://www.mongodb.com/docs/charts/>`__
