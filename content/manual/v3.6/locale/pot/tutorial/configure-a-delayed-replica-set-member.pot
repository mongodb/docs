msgid "To configure a delayed secondary member, set its :rsconf:`members[n].priority` value to ``0``, its :rsconf:`members[n].hidden` value to ``true``, and its :rsconf:`members[n].slaveDelay` value to the number of seconds to delay."

msgid "After the replica set reconfigures, the delayed secondary member cannot become :term:`primary` and is hidden from applications. The :rsconf:`members[n].slaveDelay` value delays both replication and the member's :term:`oplog` by 3600 seconds (1 hour)."

msgid "When updating the replica configuration object, access the replica set members in the :rsconf:`members` array with the **array index**. The array index begins with ``0``. Do **not** confuse this index value with the value of the :rsconf:`members[n]._id` field in each document in the :rsconf:`members` array."

#: ../source/includes/warning-rs-reconfig.rst:3
msgid "The :method:`rs.reconfig()` shell method can force the current primary to step down, which causes an :ref:`election <replica-set-elections>`. When the primary steps down, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` closes all client connections. While this typically takes 10-20 seconds, try to make these changes during scheduled maintenance periods."
