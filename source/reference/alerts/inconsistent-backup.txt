=================================
Inconsistent Backup Configuration
=================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Description
-----------

|mms| has detected that the configuration for a backup does
not match the configuration of the MongoDB deployment.

Common Triggers
---------------

- The backup was configured to use MMAPv1 but the deployment uses
  WiredTiger.
 
- The MongoDB deployment was configured with the ``"directoryPerDb" :
  true`` option, but the backup did not include that startup option.

Possible Solutions
------------------

- Update the storage engine from the Backup dashboard. This triggers a
  resync of the backup.

- Change the backup startup options to match those of the MongoDB
  deployment being backed up. Trigger a resync manually from the Backup dashboard.
