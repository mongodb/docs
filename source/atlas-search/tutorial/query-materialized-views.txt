This tutorial describes how to create an index and run queries against 
the  ``sample_supplies.sales`` collection from the :ref:`sample dataset 
<sample-data>` and a new ``sample_supplies.purchaseOrders``.

An on-demand materialized view is a collection that you create and 
update using a ``$merge`` aggregation pipeline stage. You can create an
|fts| index on the materialized view and then run queries on the
materialized view using the ``$search`` aggregation pipeline stage.

This tutorial takes you through the following steps:

1. Create a collection named ``purchaseOrders`` in the 
   ``sample_supplies`` database.

#. Create two scheduled triggers:

   - ``updateMonthlySales``, with a function named ``updateMonthlySales`` that 
     initializes the ``monthlyPhoneTransactions`` materialized view using data 
     from the sample ``sample_supplies.sales`` collection.

   - ``updateMonthlyPurchaseOrders``, with a function named 
     ``updateMonthlyPurchaseOrders`` that updates the ``monthlyPhoneTransactions`` 
     materialized view using data from the ``sample_supplies.purchaseOrders`` 
     collection.

#. Create an |fts| index on the ``monthlyPhoneTransactions`` 
   materialized view.

#. Run a query on the ``monthlyPhoneTransactions`` materialized view.

Before you begin, ensure that your |service| {+cluster+} meets the 
requirements described in the :ref:`fts-tutorials-prereqs`.

To create the triggers, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` or higher access 
to the project.

Create the Scheduled Triggers
-----------------------------

In the following procedures, you create triggers to create a materialized view 
and schedule a function to update the materialized view daily.

Create the ``updateMonthlySales`` Trigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Procedure
`````````

Create an Atlas Search Index on the Materialized View
-----------------------------------------------------

Create an |fts| index on the ``monthlyPhoneTransactions`` collection.

.. include:: /includes/steps-cross-collection-index-create-index.rst

Run a Query on the Materialized View
------------------------------------

Run a query against the newly updated and indexed 
``monthlyPhoneTransactions`` collection.
