.. note:: **Availability**

   - |service| provides |fts| metrics for {+database-deployments+} with 
     at least one active |fts| index. To set up an |fts| index, see
     :ref:`fts-top-ref`.
     
   - ``M0`` (Free Tier) {+clusters+} don't support these metrics.

Required Access
---------------

To view |fts| indexes, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Data Access Read Only` or higher access to the project.

View |fts| Metrics
-------------------------

To view |fts| metrics for a {+database-deployment+}:

#. Click the :guilabel:`View Monitoring` button for that
   {+database-deployment+}.

#. If you deployed Search Nodes for workload isolation, click the
   :guilabel:`Search Nodes` tab to view |fts| metrics and the hardware
   metrics for the Search Nodes. 

   The :guilabel:`Replica Set` tab displays the MongoDB and the
   replica set's hardware :ref:`metrics <review-replica-set-metrics>`. 

#. Select one or more of the search charts.

Alternatively:

#. Click on the name of the {+database-deployment+} to open the 
   {+database-deployment+} overview.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Metrics` tab.

#. If you deployed Search Nodes for workload isolation, click the
   :guilabel:`Search Nodes` tab to view |fts| metrics and the
   hardware metrics for the Search Nodes.

   The :guilabel:`Replica Set` tab displays the MongoDB and the
   replica set's hardware :ref:`metrics <review-replica-set-metrics>`. 
 
#. Select one or more of the search charts.

If you deployed Search Nodes for workload isolation, you can also view
|fts| metrics and the hardware metrics for your Search Nodes by clicking
the :guilabel:`View Search Metrics` tab in your :guilabel:`Search` page
after you create an |fts| index. 

If you didn't deploy Search Nodes separately, to view |fts| metrics for
a specific process: 

#. Click the link for the process.
 
#. Click the :guilabel:`Search Metrics` tab.

The following |fts| metrics are available to evaluate and optimize your 
|fts| indexes:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80 
   :header-rows: 1
        
   * - Chart
        
     - Data

   * - :guilabel:`Search Disk Space Used`
   
     - Total bytes of disk space used by search indexes, diagnostic data, and logs.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Fields Indexed`

     -  Total number of unique fields present in the |fts| 
        index.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Index Size`

     - Total size of all indexes on disk in bytes.

   * - :guilabel:`Search JVM Heap Memory`

     - Amount of memory that the JVM heap is currently 
       using.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Max Number of Lucene Docs`

     - Upper bound on the number of Lucene docs used to store |fts| 
       indexes in this replica set or shard.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Max Replication Lag`
    
     - Approximate number of milliseconds that |fts| is behind in 
       replicating changes from the :term:`oplog` of |mongod|.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Normalized Process CPU`
   
     - CPU usage of search processes on the node scaled to a 
       range of 0-100% by dividing by the number of CPU cores.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Opcounters`

     - Total number of |fts| operations.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Page Fault`
   
     - Average rate of page faults on this process per second over the
       selected sample period.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Process CPU`
   
     - Percentage of time that the CPU spent servicing 
       search processes. For servers with more than 1 CPU core, this value can exceed 100%.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Process Memory` 
   
     - Total bytes of memory that search processes occupy.

   * - :guilabel:`Search Query Status`

     - Total number of |fts| queries with each status.

Chart Controls
--------------
 
|service| provides the following controls for the metrics charts.
Adjusting any of these options affects all charts displayed under 
the selected view:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/monitor-view-chart-controls.rst
 
Chart Display
-------------
 
When viewing charts, you can do the following:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/monitor-chart-controls.rst
 
Chart Selection
---------------
 
|service| displays the available metrics to chart for the
selected {+database-deployment+} under the :guilabel:`Toggle Charts` 
header. 
 
Charts marked with the ``+`` symbol are inactive, 
while charts marked with the ``-`` symbol are active. Click
on any chart to toggle the chart state.
