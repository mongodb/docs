              If you have installed MongoDB Community using a package
              manager, follow the package manager instructions for your
              operating system:

              - :doc:`Red Hat Enterprise or CentOS </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-red-hat>`

              - :doc:`Ubuntu </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-ubuntu>`

              - :doc:`Debian </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-debian>`

              - :doc:`SUSE </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-suse>`

              - :doc:`Amazon Linux </tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-amazon>`

              During the installation, the package manager will remove the
              community packages; this will not affect the running
              deployment until you restart.

              If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager,
              you can manually download the MongoDB binaries from the
              `MongoDB Download Center
              <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/enterprise?tck=docs_server>`__. Follow
              the manual instructions, including specific prerequisites
              for MongoDB Enterprise, for your operating system:

                 Install to a location different from that of your current
                 Community edition.
              
                 In the upgrade procedure, you will use the existing data
                 directory and, if applicable, the existing configuration
                 file.

                 You cannot use the ``.msi`` to install the Enterprise
                 edition if you have the Community edition of the same
                 release series installed on the same machine. That is, if
                 you have version 4.0.0 Community edition installed, you
                 cannot use the ``.msi`` to install the 4.0.0 or 4.0.1
                 Enterprise edition.

              1. Manually download the archive file from the `MongoDB
