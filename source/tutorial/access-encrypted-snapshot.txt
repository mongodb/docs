When you use :ref:`security-kms-encryption`, |service| encrypts the
``mongod`` data files in your snapshots.  If you want to download and
restore a snapshot, the ``mongod`` can't read these data files unless it
has access to a |kmip| server that can provide the appropriate
decryption key. You can use the |kmip| Proxy Standalone to access the
``mongod`` data files. You download the |kmip| Proxy Standalone as a
binary for your specific operating system.

Considerations
--------------

By default, the |kmip| Proxy Standalone uses the credentials stored in
the
``/<dbPath>/cloudProviderCredentials/<keyID>.<cloudProvider>.metadata``
file. 

- If you rotate keys, these credentials reflect the latest key
  rotation.

- If the |kmip| Proxy Standalone binary is unable to decrypt the snapshots
  using these credentials, the binary shows an error message stating that
  you must update the metadata files on disk that contain the old
  credentials. You can update the metadata file with any text editor.

- If you use :ref:`role-based access to your encryption key
  <aws-kms-enable-project>`, the 
  ``/<dbPath>/cloudProviderCredentials/<keyID>.<cloudProvider>.metadata``
  file won't contain valid credentials. 

  Take one of the following actions:

  - Update the 
    ``/<dbPath>/cloudProviderCredentials/<keyID>.<cloudProvider>.metadata``
    file. Use an empty ``roleId``. Provide temporary credentials based
    on the |iam| role that can access your encryption key in the
    ``accessKeyId`` and ``secretAccessKey`` fields:

    .. code-block:: json
     
       {
         "accessKeyId": "TemporaryAccessKeyId",
         "secretAccessKey": "TemporarySecretAccessKey",
         "roleId": "",
         "region": "us-east-1"
       }

  - Start the |kmip| Proxy Standalone binary with the following options:

    - ``awsAccessKey``
    - ``awsSecretAccessKey``
    - ``awsRegion``

  To generate temporary credentials based on an |iam| role, see the 
  :aws:`AWS documentation 
  </STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html>`.
