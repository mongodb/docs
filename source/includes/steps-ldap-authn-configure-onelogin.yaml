  a. To learn more about setting up the OneLogin |ldap| service, see the 
     `OneLogin documentation 
     <https://onelogin.service-now.com/support/?id=kb_article&sys_id=7b3ad943db109700d5505eea4b9619db>`__.
     
     .. important:: You may need to contact OneLogin support to enable 
        the VLDAP service for your account.

  #. Note your ``<onelogin-instance-id>``. You must provide it
     in several places during the configuration process.

     The instance name is located in the URL you use to sign in to your OneLogin
     account:

     .. code-block:: sh
        :copyable: false

        https://<onelogin-instance-id>.onelogin.com

title: "Whitelist IPs."
level: 4
ref: ip-access-list-ips-onelogin
content: |

  In OneLogin, click :guilabel:`Authentication`, then click 
  :guilabel:`VLDAP`. Add the following to the 
  :guilabel:`Allow access by IP address` field to add them to the 
  whitelist:

  a. The IP address of each node in your |service| cluster. Use 
     ``nslookup`` to get the IP address of each host in your cluster,
     using hostnames that |service| generates:

     .. code-block:: sh
        :copyable: false
      
        nslookup cluster0-shard-00-00-example.mongodb.net

     .. note::

        If the :ref:`IP addresses of any of your nodes change 
        <faq-public-ip-changes>`, you must update the whitelist with 
        the new IP addresses.
      
  #. (**Optional**) The IP address of a machine you can run ``ldapsearch``
     commands from to :ref:`troubleshoot LDAP connection issues 
     <ldaps-onelogin-troubleshooting>`.

  a. `Create a new OneLogin user 
     <https://onelogin.service-now.com/support/?id=kb_article&sys_id=8bf95543db109700d5505eea4b96198b&kb_category=fdf52dfcdbd45340d5505eea4b96192b>`__ 
     to use as the |service| bind user. The bind user is a OneLogin 
     user that you use to query the account and to authenticate database 
     users' credentials when they connect to an |service| database.

     The :guilabel:`Email` and :guilabel:`Username` fields are required 
     when you create the bind user. You should enter the same email 
     address in both of these fields.

     .. important::
        Don't use your own user account for the bind user.

  #. Use the following template to determine the full Distinguished Name
     (DN) of your bind user:  

     .. code-block:: sh

        cn=<bind-user-email>,ou=users,dc=<onelogin-instance-id>,dc=onelogin,dc=com

     For example, if your ``<bind-user-email>`` is ``bind@example.com`` and 
     your ``<onelogin-instance-id>`` is ``mdb-example``, your bind
     user's DN is: 
     
     .. code-block:: sh
        :copyable: false

        cn=bind@example.com,ou=users,dc=mdb-example,dc=onelogin,dc=com

title: "Assign privileges to the bind user."
level: 4
ref: bind-user-privileges-onelogin
content: |

  In |ldap-provider|, assign the bind user the ``Manage users``, 
  ``Manage group``, or ``Super user`` privilege.

  .. note::

     If you grant the bind user the ``Manage group`` privilege, you must
     select a group. |service| can only authenticate and authorize 
     |ldap| users who belong to this group.

  a. Navigate to your OneLogin Users page.
  #. Click the bind user.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Add Privilege`.
  #. Select the privilege  you want to grant the user, then click 
     :guilabel:`Continue`.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Save User`.

  If you have not done so already, set a password for the bind user in

  a. Click :guilabel:`More Actions`, then click

title: "Create database users in |ldap-provider|."
level: 4
ref: create-db-users-onelogin
content: |

  If they don't exist already, create users in |ldap-provider| that you want to 
  grant database access to:

  a. Navigate to your OneLogin users page.
  #. Click :guilabel:`New User`.
  #. Enter the user's details.

     The :guilabel:`Email` and :guilabel:`Username` fields are required 
     when you create database users. Enter the same email address in 
     both of these fields.

     .. note:: 
     
        Avoid entering email addresses with plus symbols (`+`). The
        |service| |ldap| integration may encounter issues with email
        addresses containing plus symbols.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Save User`.
