The MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence allows you to query a 
MongoDB database using SQL commands to aid in data analysis. It 
translates SQL queries from data analysis tools to MongoDB aggregation 
pipelines on MongoDB database.

.. note::
   The BI Connector only allows 
   `read-only operations <https://docs.mongodb.com/bi-connector/current/supported-operations/>`_ 
   on data served in MongoDB databases. To create, update, or delete 
   data you must use the MongoDB shell or any appropriate driver.

.. seealso::

   For specifics on the BI Connector, see the 
   `BI Connector manual <https://docs.mongodb.com/bi-connector/>`_.
