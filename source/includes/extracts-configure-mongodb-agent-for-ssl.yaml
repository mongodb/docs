  .. note::

     |mms| can manage |tls| for you if you are using {+aagent+} for
     the deployment. With {+aagent+}, |mms| prompts you for the
     certificates to use to connect to the deployment when you enable
     |tls| and then configures the agents appropriately. To learn
     how to configure |tls|, see
     :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment`.

  To ensure that the {+mdbagent+} uses |tls| when connecting to
  |onprem|, configure |onprem| to use |tls| for all connections.
  The :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl-connection-to-web-interface`
  tutorial describes how to set up |onprem| to run over |tls|.

  By default, the {+mdbagent+} validates the |mms| |tls|
  certificate.

  If a trusted third party did not sign your certificate,
  you must configure the {+mdbagent+} to trust |onprem|.

  To specify a self-signed certificate for |onprem| that the
  {+mdbagent+} should trust:

  .. include:: /includes/steps/on-prem-mongodb-agent-configure-trust.rst

  If you don't want to have |mms| validate the |ssl| certificates, set
  :setting:`Client Certificate Mode` to :guilabel:`None`.
