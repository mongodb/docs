  The user's password. The ``pwd`` field is not
  required if you run |local-cmd-name| on the ``$external``
  database to create users who have credentials stored externally to
  MongoDB.
  
  The value can be either:

  - the user's password in cleartext string, or

  - :method:`passwordPrompt()` to prompt for the user's password.

  The authentication restrictions the server enforces on the created

  accept users.

   Specify the specific SCRAM mechanism or mechanisms for creating
   SCRAM user credentials. If :parameter:`authenticationMechanisms` is
   specified, you can only specify a subset of the
   :parameter:`authenticationMechanisms`.

   Valid values are:

   - ``"SCRAM-SHA-1"``

     - Uses the ``SHA-1`` hashing function.

   - ``"SCRAM-SHA-256"``

     - Uses the ``SHA-256`` hashing function.

     - Requires featureCompatibilityVersion set to ``4.0``.

     - Requires {{digest}} to be {{defaultdigest}}.

   The default for featureCompatibilityVersion is ``4.0`` is both
   ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` and ``SCRAM-SHA-256``.

   The default for featureCompatibilityVersion is ``3.6`` is
   ``SCRAM-SHA-1``.

   Indicates whether the server or the client digests the password.

   If true, the server receives undigested password from the client and
   digests the password.

   If false, the client digests the password and passes the digested
   password to the server. Not compatible with ``SCRAM-SHA-256``

   .. versionchanged:: 4.0

      The default value is ``true``. In earlier versions, the default
      value is ``false``.
