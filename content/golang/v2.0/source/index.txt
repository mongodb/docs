Overview
--------

Welcome to the documentation site for the official {+driver-long+}.
You can add the driver to your application to work with MongoDB in Go.
Download it by using `go get <https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go/internal/get>`__
or set up a runnable project by following the :ref:`Get Started
<go-get-started>` guide.

Learn how to create and configure a connection to a MongoDB deployment in the
:ref:`Connect <golang-mongoclient>` section.

Context Package
---------------

Learn how to use the context package from the Go standard library to manage 
blocking method calls in the :ref:`golang-context` guide.

Databases and Collections
-------------------------

Learn how to interact with MongoDB databases and collections in the

meaning rather than keyword matches in the :ref:`golang-atlas-vector-search`
guide.

Monitoring and Logging
----------------------

Learn how to monitor changes to your application and write them to logs in the
:ref:`Monitoring and Logging <golang-monitoring>` section.

Secure Your Data
