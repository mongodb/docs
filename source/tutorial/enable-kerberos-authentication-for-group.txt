Overview
--------

.. next two paragraphs stolenish from the MongoDB Manual

`MongoDB Enterprise <http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise?jmp=docs>`_
supports authentication using a Kerberos service. Kerberos is an industry
standard authentication protocol for large client/server systems.

To use MongoDB with Kerberos, you must have a properly configured
Kerberos deployment, configure *Kerberos service principals* for
MongoDB, and add the *Kerberos user principal*. The :manual:`Kerberos
Authentication </core/kerberos>` section of the MongoDB Manual provides
more detail about using MongoDB with Kerberos.

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/enterprise-availability-kerberos.rst

This tutorial describes how to enable Kerberos for your |mms| group,
and how to configure your |mms| Agents to connect to your Kerberized 
deployment. 

Setting up and configuring a Kerberos deployment is beyond the scope of
this document. This tutorial assumes you have configured a Kerberos
service principal for each Agent and you have a valid keytab file for each Agent.

Procedures
----------

Configure an Existing Deployment for Kerberos-based Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have one or more existing deployments managed by |mms|,
the MongoDB deployment must be configured for Kerberos authentication 
before you can enable Kerberos authentication for your group.

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-existing-deployment-for-kerberos.rst

When you have configured the Kerberos options for each deployment,
you can proceed to enable Kerberos for your |mms| group.
