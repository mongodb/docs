Overview
--------

You can remove a process from management, monitoring, or both.
Removing a process does **not** shut down the process.
You can remove individual processes or
an entire :term:`cluster <sharded cluster>` or :term:`replica set`.

Managed Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removing a process from management (i.e., Automation) means you can no
longer control it directly through |mms|. If you are removing a managed
process and want to be able to easily stop and start the
process after removal, you can :doc:`create scripts for stopping and
starting the process </tutorial/stop-using-automation>`.

If you do **not** want to leave a managed process running after removal,
:doc:`shut down the process </tutorial/shut-down-deployment>` before
removing it.

You can continue to monitor the process after unmanaging it. If you do
continue monitoring the process, you do not need to change any backups running
for that process.

As an alternative to removing a process from automated management, you can
temporarily :doc:`suspend </tutorial/suspend-automation>` management of the process.
This is useful if you need to temporarily shut down the process, for example
for maintenance, and do not want |mms| to automatically start the
process back up until you are ready.

Monitored Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removing a process from monitoring means |mms| no longer displays
its status or tracks its metrics. 

Before you can remove monitored deployment, you must :ref:`terminate the
deployment's backups <terminate-backup>`.

As an alternative to removing a process from monitoring, you can instead
disable its alerts, which allows you to continue to view the process in
the :guilabel:`Deployment` page but turns off notifications about its
status. To use this option, see :ref:`manage-host-alerts`.
