   Run the following command from the directory containing the
   ``mongosh`` ``.tgz`` package:
   
   .. code-block:: sh

      tar -zxvf mongosh-{+version+}-linux-x64.tgz

   The extracted ``bin`` folder contains two binaries: ``mongosh`` and
   ``mongosh_csfle_v1.so``.

   If your web browser automatically extracts the archive as part of the
   download or you extract the archive without the ``tar`` command,
   you may need to make the binary executable. Run the following
   command from the directory where you extracted the archive:

   .. code-block:: sh

      chmod +x bin/mongosh

   You can either:

   - Copy the ``mongosh`` binary into a directory listed in your
     ``PATH`` variable, such as ``/usr/local/bin``. Run the following
     commands from the directory where you extracted the download file:

     .. code-block:: sh

       sudo cp mongosh /usr/local/bin/
       sudo cp mongosh_csfle_v1.so /usr/local/lib/

   - Create symbolic links to the ``MongoDB Shell``. Switch to the
     directory where you extracted the files from the ``.tgz`` archive.
     Run the following command to create links to a directory already
     in your ``PATH`` such as ``/usr/local/bin``. 

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo ln -s $(pwd)/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
