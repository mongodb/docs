Overview
--------
 
To access |service|, you must have an |service| user account. If you are
an existing MongoDB Cloud Manager user, you can use your Cloud Manager 
credentials.

To access clusters in a project, users must belong to that project. Users 
can belong to multiple projects.

.. _atlas_roles:

Roles
-----

When you add a user to a project, you also assign either the ``Owner`` or 
``Read-only`` role to the user. The role determines the actions the 
user can perform. You can modify a role for an existing user.  See 
:ref:`atlas_edit_users`.

To assign or edit user roles in a project, you must have the 
:guilabel:`Owner` role in the project. The user who creates a project is 
automatically assigned :guilabel:`Owner` role.

.. important::

   |service| users are separate from MongoDB users. MongoDB users can
   access MongoDB databases, while |service| users can access the
   |service| application itself.

.. _atlas_add_users:

Add Users
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/atlas-users-add.rst

View Users
----------

To view users, click :guilabel:`Users`.

Users are ordered by status. They appear in the following 
sequence:

1. Users currently in your project.
#. Users with pending invitations to join your project.
#. Users requesting to join your project.

A user can request to join a project when first registering for |service|.

View Invitations
----------------

When you invite a user to join a project, if the user exists in |service|
they are added to the project automatically. If the user does not exist in
|service|, |service| sends an email invitation to join the project.

To view any unaccepted invitations, click :guilabel:`Users`. The 
invitee's role appears as *--invite sent--*. To cancel an 
invitation, click :guilabel:`Cancel Invite`.

Remove Users
------------

.. important::

   You cannot delete the last user in a project. You must instead 
   :ref:`close the project <how-do-i-remove-my-company-project>`.
    
   You cannot delete the last :guilabel:`Owner` remaining in the project. 
   You must first assign the role to at least one other user before 
   deleting the original user.
