   :sorted:

   $cmd
      A virtual :term:`collection` that exposes MongoDB's
      :term:`database commands <database command>`.
      To use database commands, see :ref:`issue-commands`.

   _id
      A field required in every MongoDB :term:`document`. The
      :ref:`_id <document-id-field>` field must have a unique value. You can
      think of the ``_id`` field as the document's :term:`primary key`.
      If you create a new document without an ``_id`` field, MongoDB
      automatically creates the field and assigns a unique
      BSON :term:`ObjectId` to the field.

   accumulator
      An :term:`expression` in an :term:`aggregation pipeline` that
      maintains state between documents in the aggregation
      :term:`pipeline`. For a list of accumulator operations, see
      :pipeline:`$group`.

   action
      An operation the user can perform on a resource. Actions and
      :term:`resources <resource>` combine to create :term:`privileges
      <privilege>`. See :ref:`action <security-user-actions>`.

   admin database
      A privileged database. Users
      must have access to the ``admin`` database to run certain
      administrative commands. For a list of administrative commands,
      see :ref:`admin-commands`.

   aggregation
      An operation that reduces and summarizes large
      sets of data. MongoDB's :method:`~db.collection.aggregate()` and
      :method:`~db.collection.mapReduce()` methods are two
      examples of aggregation operations. For more information, see
      :ref:`aggregation`.

   aggregation pipeline
      Consists of one or more stages that process documents. Aggregation
      operators calculate aggregate values without having to use
      :term:`map-reduce`. For a list of operators, see
      :doc:`/reference/aggregation`.

   arbiter
      A :term:`replica set` member that exists just to vote in
      :term:`elections <election>`. Arbiters do not replicate data. An
      arbiter participates in elections for a :term:`primary` but cannot
      become a primary. For more details, see
      :ref:`replica-set-arbiter-configuration`.

   Atlas
      `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database?tck=docs_server>`_
      is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service.

   atomic operation
      An atomic operation is a write operation that either completes
      entirely or doesn't complete at all. For
      :ref:`distributed transactions <transactions>`, which
      involve writes to multiple documents, all writes to each document must
      succeed for the transaction to succeed. Atomic operations cannot
      partially complete. See :ref:`transactions-write-atomicity`.

   authentication
      Verification of the user identity. See
      :doc:`/core/authentication`.

   authorization
      Provisioning of access to databases and operations. See
      :doc:`/core/authorization`.

   automatic encryption
      When using :term:`In-Use Encryption`, automatically performing
      encryption and decryption based on your preconfigured
      {+enc-schema+}. The {+shared-library+} translates MongoDB
      Query Language into the correct call, meaning you don't need to
      rewrite your application for specific encrypt and decrypt calls.

   balancer
      An internal MongoDB process that runs in the context of a
      :term:`sharded cluster` and manages the migration of :term:`chunks
      <chunk>`. Administrators must disable the balancer for all
      maintenance operations on a sharded cluster. See
      :ref:`sharding-balancing`.

   backup cursor
      A :term:`tailable cursor` that points to a list of backup files. 
      Backup cursors are for internal use only.

   blocking sort
      A sort that must be performed in memory before the output is returned. 
      Blocking sorts may impact performance for large data sets. Use an 
      :term:`indexed sort` to avoid a blocking sort.

      See :ref:`sort-index-use` for more information on blocking sort
      operations.
      
   bounded collection scan
      A plan used by the :doc:`query optimizer </core/query-plans>` that
      excludes documents with specific field value ranges. For
      example, if a range of date field values is outside of a specified
      date range, the documents in that range are excluded from the
      query plan. See :ref:`explain-output-collection-scan`.

   BSON
      A serialization format used to store :term:`documents <document>` and make
      remote procedure calls in MongoDB. "BSON" is a combination of the words
      "binary" and "JSON". Think of BSON as a binary representation
      of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) documents. See
      :ref:`bson-types` and
      :doc:`/reference/mongodb-extended-json`.

   BSON types
      The set of types supported by the :term:`BSON` serialization
      format. For a list of BSON types, see :ref:`bson-types`.

   B-tree
      A data structure commonly used by database management systems to
      store indexes. MongoDB uses B-tree indexes.

   CAP Theorem
      Given three properties of computing systems, consistency,
      availability, and partition tolerance, a distributed computing
      system can provide any two of these features, but never all
      three.

   capped collection
      A fixed-sized :term:`collection <collection>` that automatically
      overwrites its oldest entries when the collection reaches its maximum size.
      The MongoDB :term:`oplog` that is used in :term:`replication` is a
      capped collection. See :doc:`/core/capped-collections`.

   cardinality
      The measure of the number of elements within a set of values.
      For example, the set ``A = { 2, 4, 6 }`` contains 3 elements,
      and has a cardinality of 3. See :ref:`shard-key-cardinality`.

   cartesian product
      The result of combining two data sets where the combined set
      contains every possible combination of values. 

   cfq
      Complete Fairness Queueing (cfq) is an I/O operation scheduler
      that allocates bandwidth for incoming request processes.

   checksum
      A calculated value used to ensure data integrity.
      The :term:`md5` algorithm is sometimes used as a checksum.

   chunk
      A contiguous range of :term:`shard key` values within a
      :term:`shard`. Chunk ranges are inclusive of the lower boundary
      and exclusive of the upper boundary. MongoDB splits chunks when
      they grow bigger than the configured chunk size. The default chunk
      size is 128 megabytes. MongoDB migrates chunks when a shard
      contains too many chunks of a collection relative to other shards.
      For more details, see :ref:`sharding-data-partitioning`,
      :ref:`sharding-balancing`, :ref:`sharded-cluster-balancer`, and
      :ref:`release-notes-6.1-balancing-policy-changes`.

   client
      The application layer that uses a database for data persistence
      and storage. :term:`Drivers <driver>` provide the interface
      level between the application layer and the database server.

      A client can also be a single thread or process.

   client affinity
      A consistent client connection to a specified data source.

   cluster
      See :term:`sharded cluster`.

   clustered collection
      A :term:`collection` that stores documents ordered by a
      :ref:`clustered index <db.createCollection.clusteredIndex>` key.
      See :ref:`clustered-collections`.

   cluster-to-cluster sync
      Synchronizes data between :term:`sharded clusters <sharded
      cluster>`. Also known as C2C sync.

   CMK
      Abbreviation of Customer Master Key, see 
      :term:`Customer Master Key`.

   collection
      A grouping of MongoDB :term:`documents <document>`. A collection
      is the equivalent of an :term:`RDBMS` table. A collection is
      in a single :term:`database`. Collections do not enforce a
      schema. Documents in a collection can have different fields.
      Typically, documents in a collection have a similar or related
      purpose. See :ref:`faq-dev-namespace`.

   collection scan
      Collection scans are a query execution strategy where MongoDB must
      inspect every document in a collection to see if it matches the
      query criteria. These queries are very inefficient and don't use
      indexes. See :doc:`/core/query-optimization` for details about
      query execution strategies.

   commit
      Saves data changes made after the start of the
      :dbcommand:`startSession` command. Operations within a
      :term:`transaction` are not permanent until they are committed
      with the :dbcommand:`commitTransaction` command.

   commit quorum
      During an :ref:`index build <index-operations-replicated-build>`
      the :ref:`commit quorum <createIndexes-cmd-commitQuorum>`
      specifies how many secondaries must be ready to commit their local
      index build before the primary node performs the commit.

   compound index
      An :term:`index` consisting of two or more keys. See
      :ref:`index-type-compound`.

   concurrency control
      Concurrency control ensures that database operations can be
      executed concurrently without compromising correctness.
      Pessimistic concurrency control, such as that used in systems
      with :term:`locks <lock>`, blocks any potentially
      conflicting operations even if they may not conflict.
      Optimistic concurrency control, the approach
      used by :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`, delays
      checking until after a conflict may have occurred, ending and
      retrying one of the operations in any :term:`write
      conflict`.

   config database
      An internal database with metadata for a :term:`sharded cluster`.
      Typically, you don't modify the ``config`` database. For more
      information about the ``config`` database, see
      :doc:`/reference/config-database`.

   config server
      A :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that stores all the metadata
      associated with a :term:`sharded cluster`.
      See :ref:`sharding-config-server`.

   connection pool
     A cache of database connections maintained by the driver. The cached 
     connections are re-used when connections to the database are 
     required, instead of opening new connections.

   container
      A collected set of software and its dependent libraries that are
      packaged together to make transferring between computing
      environments easier. Containers run as compartmentalized processes
      on your operating system, and can be given their own resource
      constraints. Common container technologies are Docker and
      Kubernetes.

   CRUD
      An acronym for the fundamental operations of a database: Create,
      Read, Update, and Delete. See :ref:`crud`.

   CSV
      A text data format with comma-separated values.
      CSV files can be used to exchange data between relational
      databases because CSV files have tabular data. You can
      import CSV files using :binary:`~bin.mongoimport`.

   cursor
      A pointer to the result set of a :term:`query`. Clients can
      iterate through a cursor to retrieve results. By default, cursors 
      not opened within a session automatically timeout after 10 
      minutes of inactivity. Cursors opened in a session close with 
      the end or timeout of the session. 
      See :ref:`read-operations-cursors`.

   Customer Master Key
      A key that encrypts your :term:`Data Encryption Key`. 
      The customer master key must be hosted in a remote key 
      provider.

   daemon
      A background, non-interactive process.

   data directory
      The file system location where :binary:`~bin.mongod` stores data
      files. :setting:`~storage.dbPath` specifies the data directory.

   Data Encryption Key
      A key you use to encrypt the fields in your MongoDB 
      documents. The **encrypted** Data Encryption Key is stored in your 
      Key Vault collection. The Data Encryption Key is 
      encrypted by the :term:`Customer Master Key`.

   data files
      Store document data and indexes. The :setting:`~storage.dbPath`
      option specifies the file system location for the data files. 

   data partition
      A distributed system architecture that splits data into ranges.
      :term:`Sharding <sharding>` uses partitioning. See
      :ref:`sharding-data-partitioning`.

   data-center awareness
      A property that allows clients to address members in a system
      based on their locations. :term:`Replica sets <replica set>`
      implement data-center awareness using :term:`tagging <tag>`. See
      :doc:`/data-center-awareness`.

   database
      A container for :term:`collections <collection>`.
      Each database has a set of files in the file
      system. One MongoDB server typically has multiple
      databases.

   database command
      A MongoDB operation, other than an insert, update, remove, or
      query. For a list of database commands, see
      :doc:`/reference/command`. To use database commands, see
      :ref:`issue-commands`.

   database profiler
      A tool that, when enabled, keeps a record on all long-running
      operations in a database's ``system.profile`` collection. The
      profiler is most often used to diagnose slow queries. See
      :ref:`database-profiling`.

   dbpath
      The location of MongoDB's data file storage. See
      :setting:`~storage.dbPath`.

   DDL (Data Definition Language)
      DDL includes commands that create and modify collections and
      indexes.

   delayed member
      A :term:`replica set` member that cannot become primary and
      applies operations at a specified delay. The delay is useful for
      protecting data from human error (unintentionally deleted
      databases) or updates that have unforeseen effects on the
      production database. See :ref:`replica-set-delayed-members`.

   DEK
      Data Encryption Key. For more details, see 
      :term:`Data Encryption Key`.

   document
      A record in a MongoDB :term:`collection` and the basic unit of
      data in MongoDB. Documents are analogous to :term:`JSON` objects
      but exist in the database in a more type-rich format known as
      :term:`BSON`. See :doc:`/core/document`.

   dot notation
      MongoDB uses the dot notation to access the elements of an array
      and to access the fields of an embedded document. See
      :ref:`document-dot-notation`.

   draining
      The process of removing or "shedding" :term:`chunks <chunk>` from
      one :term:`shard` to another. Administrators must drain shards
      before removing them from the cluster. See
      :doc:`/tutorial/remove-shards-from-cluster`.

   driver
      A client library for interacting with MongoDB in a particular
      computer language. See :driver:`driver </>`.

   durable
      A write operation is durable when it persists after a shutdown (or
      crash) and restart of one or more server processes. For a single
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` server, a write operation is considered
      durable when it has been written to the server's :term:`journal`
      file. For a :doc:`replica set </replication>`, a write operation
      is considered durable after the write operation achieves
      durability on a majority of voting nodes and written to a majority
      of voting nodes' journals.

   election
      The process where members of a :term:`replica set` select a
      :term:`primary` on startup and in the event of a failure. See
      :ref:`replica-set-elections`.

   explicit encryption
      When using :term:`In-Use Encryption`, explicitly specifying the
      encryption or decryption operation, keyID, and
      query type (for {+qe+}) or algorithm (for {+csfle+}) when working
      with encrypted data. Compare to :term:`automatic encryption`.

   unix epoch
      January 1st, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC. Commonly used in expressing time,
      where the number of seconds or milliseconds since this point is counted.

   envelope encryption
      An encryption procedure where data is encrypted using a
      :term:`Data Encryption Key` and the data encryption key is
      encrypted by another key called the :term:`Customer Master Key`.
      The encrypted keys are stored as :term:`BSON` documents in a
      MongoDB collection called the KeyVault.

   eventual consistency
      A property of a distributed system that allows changes to the
      system to propagate gradually. In a database system, this means
      that readable members aren't required to have the latest
      updates.

   expression
      In an :term:`aggregation pipeline`, expressions are
      the stateless transformations that operate on the data that passes
      through a :term:`pipeline`. See :ref:`aggregation-pipeline`.

   failover
      The process that allows a :term:`secondary` member of a
      :term:`replica set` to become :term:`primary` in the event of a
      failure. See :ref:`replication-auto-failover`.

   field
      A name-value pair in a :term:`document <document>`. A document has
      zero or more fields. Fields are analogous to columns in relational
      databases. See :ref:`document-structure`.

   field path
      Path to a field in a document. To specify a field path, use a
      string that prefixes the field name with a dollar sign (``$``).

   firewall
      A system level network filter that restricts access based on
      IP addresses and other parameters. Firewalls are part of a
      secure network. See :ref:`security-firewalls`.

   fsync
      A system call that flushes all dirty, in-memory pages to storage.
      As applications write data, MongoDB records the data in the
      storage layer.

      .. include:: /includes/checkpoints.rst

   geohash
      A geohash value is a binary representation of the location on a
      coordinate grid. See :ref:`geospatial-indexes-geohash`.

   GeoJSON
      A :term:`geospatial` data interchange format based on JavaScript
      Object Notation (:term:`JSON`). GeoJSON is used in
      :doc:`geospatial queries </geospatial-queries>`. For
      supported GeoJSON objects, see :ref:`geo-overview-location-data`.
      For the GeoJSON format specification, see
      `<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1>`_.

   geospatial
      Relating to geographical location. See :doc:`/geospatial-queries`.

   GridFS
      A convention for storing large files in a MongoDB database. All of
      the official MongoDB drivers support the GridFS convention, as does the
      :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` program. See :doc:`/core/gridfs`.

   hashed shard key
      A type of :term:`shard key` that uses a hash of the value
      in the shard key field to distribute documents among members of
      the :term:`sharded cluster`. See :ref:`index-type-hashed`.

   health manager
     A health manager runs health checks on a :term:`health manager 
     facet` at a specified :ref:`intensity level 
     <health-managers-intensity-levels>`. The health manager checks are run at 
     specified time intervals. A health manager can be configured to 
     move a failing :ref:`mongos <mongos>` out of a cluster 
     automatically.

   health manager facet
      A set of features that a :term:`health
      manager` can be configured to run health checks for. For 
      example, you can configure a health manager to monitor and
      manage DNS or LDAP cluster health issues automatically. See 
      :ref:`health-managers-facets` for details.

   hidden member
      A :term:`replica set` member that cannot become :term:`primary`
      and are invisible to client applications. See
      :ref:`replica-set-hidden-members`.

   high availability
     High availability indicates a system designed for durability,
     redundancy, and automatic failover. Applications
     supported by the system can operate without
     downtime for a long time period. MongoDB
     :ref:`replica sets <replication>` support
     high availability when deployed according to the
     :ref:`best practices <production-checklist-replication>`.

     For guidance on replica set deployment architecture, see
     :ref:`replica-set-architecture`.

   idempotent
      An operation produces the same result with the
      same input when run multiple times.

   index
      A data structure that optimizes queries. See :doc:`/indexes`.

   index bounds
      The range of index values that MongoDB searches when using an
      index to run a query. To learn more, see
      :ref:`multikey-index-bounds`.

   init script
      A shell script used by a Linux platform's
      :term:`init system` to start, restart, or stop a :term:`daemon`
      process. If you installed MongoDB using a package manager, an init
      script is provided for your system as part of the
      installation. See the respective
      :ref:`Installation Guide <tutorial-installation>` for your operating
      system.

   init system
      The init system is the first process started on a Linux platform
      after the kernel starts, and manages all other processes on the
      system. The init system uses an :term:`init script` to start,
      restart, or stop a :term:`daemon` process, such as
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`. Recent Linux
      versions typically use the **systemd** init system and the
      ``systemctl`` command. Older Linux versions typically use the
      **System V** init system and the ``service`` command. See
      the Installation Guide for your operating system.

   initial sync
      The :term:`replica set` operation that replicates data from an
      existing replica set member to a new replica set member. See
      :ref:`replica-set-initial-sync`.

   intent lock
      A :term:`lock` on a resource that indicates the lock holder
      will read from (intent shared) or write to (intent
      exclusive) the resource using :term:`concurrency control` at
      a finer granularity than that of the resource with the intent
      lock. Intent locks allow concurrent readers and writers of a
      resource. See :ref:`faq-concurrency-locking`.

   In-Use Encryption
      Encryption that secures data when transmitted, stored, and 
      processed, and enables supported queries on that encrypted data. 
      MongoDB provides two approaches to In-Use Encryption: 
      :ref:`{+qe+} <qe-manual-feature-qe>` and
      :ref:`{+csfle+} <manual-csfle-feature>`.

   IPv6
      A revision to the IP (Internet Protocol) standard with a
      large address space to support Internet hosts.

   ISODate
     The international date format used by :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
     to display dates. The format is ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM.SS.millis``.

   indexed sort
      A sort where an index provides the sorted result. Sort operations that 
      use an index often have better performance than a :term:`blocking sort`. 
      See :ref:`Use Indexed to Sort Query Results <sorting-with-indexes>` for 
      more information.

   interrupt point
     A point in an operation when it can
     safely end. MongoDB only ends an operation
     at designated interrupt points. See
     :doc:`/tutorial/terminate-running-operations`.

   JavaScript
      A scripting language. :mongosh:`mongosh </>`, the legacy
      :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell, and certain server
      functions use a JavaScript interpreter. See
      :doc:`/core/server-side-javascript` for more information.

   journal
      A sequential, binary transaction log used to bring the database
      into a valid state in the event of a hard shutdown.
      Journaling writes data first to the journal and then to the core
      data files. MongoDB enables journaling by default for 64-bit
      builds of MongoDB version 2.0 and newer. Journal files are
      pre-allocated and exist as files in the :term:`data directory`.
      See :doc:`/core/journaling/`.

   JSON
      JavaScript Object Notation. A plain text format
      for expressing structured data with support in many programming
      languages. For more information, see `<http://www.json.org>`_.
      Certain MongoDB tools render an approximation of MongoDB
      :term:`BSON` documents in JSON format. See
      :doc:`/reference/mongodb-extended-json`.

   JSON document
      A :term:`JSON` document is a collection of fields and values in a
      structured format. For sample JSON documents, see
      `<http://json.org/example.html>`_.

   JSONP
      :term:`JSON` with padding. Refers to a method of injecting JSON
      into applications. **Presents potential security concerns**.

   jumbo chunk
      A :term:`chunk` that grows beyond the :ref:`specified chunk size
      <sharding-chunk-size>` and cannot split into smaller chunks. For
      more details, see :ref:`jumbo-chunks`.

   key material
      The random string of bits used by an encryption algorithm to
      encrypt and decrypt data.

   Key Vault Collection
      A MongoDB collection that stores the encrypted 
      :term:`Data Encryption Keys <Data Encryption Key>` as 
      :term:`BSON` documents.

   least privilege
      An authorization policy that grants a user only the access
      that is essential to that user's work.

   legacy coordinate pairs
      The format used for :term:`geospatial` data before MongoDB
      version 2.4. This format stores geospatial data as points on a
      planar coordinate system (for example, ``[ x, y ]``). See
      :doc:`/geospatial-queries`.

   LineString
      A LineString is an array of two or more positions. A
      closed LineString with four or more positions is called a
      LinearRing, as described in the GeoJSON LineString specification:
      `<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.4>`_. To use a
      LineString in MongoDB, see
      :ref:`geospatial-indexes-store-geojson`.

   lock
      MongoDB uses locks to ensure that :doc:`concurrency </faq/concurrency>`
      does not affect correctness. MongoDB uses :term:`read locks
      <read lock>`, :term:`write locks <write lock>` and
      :term:`intent locks <intent lock>`. For more information, see
      :ref:`faq-concurrency-locking`.

   log files
      Contain server events, such as incoming connections, commands run,
      and issues encountered. For more details, see
      :ref:`log-messages-ref`.

   LVM
      Logical volume manager. LVM is a program that abstracts disk
      images from physical devices and provides a number of raw disk
      manipulation and snapshot capabilities useful for system
      management. For information on LVM and MongoDB, see
      :ref:`lvm-backup-and-restore`.
   
   mapping type
      A structure in programming languages that associate keys with
      values. Keys may contain embedded pairs of keys and values
      (for example, dictionaries, hashes, maps, and associative arrays).
      The properties of these structures depend on the language
      specification and implementation. Typically, the order of keys in
      mapping types is arbitrary and not guaranteed.

   map-reduce
      An aggregation process that has a "map"
      phase that selects the data and a "reduce" phase that transforms the
      data. In MongoDB, you can run arbitrary aggregations over data
      using map-reduce. For the map-reduce implementation, see
      :doc:`/core/map-reduce`. For all approaches to aggregation,
      see :ref:`aggregation`.

   md5
      A hashing algorithm that calculates a :term:`checksum` for the
      supplied data. The algorithm returns a unique value
      to identify the data. MongoDB uses md5 to identify chunks of data
      for :term:`GridFS`. See :doc:`/reference/command/filemd5`.

   mean
      Average of a set of numbers.

   median
      In a dataset, the median is the percentile value where 50% of the
      data falls at or below that value.

   member
      An individual :term:`mongod` process. A :term:`replica set` has
      multiple members. A member is also known as a :term:`node`.

   metadata collection
      In :ref:`{+qe+} <qe-manual-feature-qe>`, the internal collections
      MongoDB uses to enable querying on encrypted fields. See
      :ref:`Metadata Collections <qe-metadata-collections>`.

   MIME
      Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. A standard set of type and
      encoding definitions used to declare the encoding and type of data
      in multiple data storage, transmission, and email contexts. The
      :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` tool provides an option to specify a MIME
      type to describe a file inserted into :term:`GridFS` storage.

   mode
      Number that occurs most frequently in a set of numbers.

   mongo
      The legacy MongoDB shell. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` process starts
      the legacy shell as a :term:`daemon` connected to either a
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance. The shell
      has a JavaScript interface.

      Starting in MongoDB v5.0, :binary:`~bin.mongo` is deprecated and
      :mongosh:`mongosh </>` replaces :binary:`~bin.mongo` as the
      client shell. See :mongosh:`mongosh </>`.

   mongod
      The MongoDB database server. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` process
      starts the MongoDB server as a :term:`daemon`. The MongoDB server
      manages data requests and background operations. See
      :doc:`/reference/program/mongod`.

   mongos
      The MongoDB sharded cluster query router. The
      :binary:`~bin.mongos` process starts the MongoDB router as a
      :term:`daemon`. The MongoDB router acts as an interface
      between an application and a MongoDB :term:`sharded cluster` and
      handles all routing and load balancing across the cluster. See
      :doc:`/reference/program/mongos`.

   mongosh
      MongoDB Shell. :mongosh:`mongosh </>` provides a shell
      interface to either a :binary:`~bin.mongod` or a
      :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

      Starting in MongoDB v5.0, :mongosh:`mongosh </>` replaces
      :binary:`~bin.mongo` as the preferred shell.

   namespace
      A namespace is a combination of the database name and
      the name of the collection or index:
      ``<database-name>.<collection-or-index-name>``. All documents
      belong to a namespace. See :ref:`faq-dev-namespace`.

   natural order
      The order that the database stores documents on disk. Natural order is the
      default sort order. See :operator:`$natural` and
      :ref:`return-natural-order`.

   network partition
      A network failure that separates a distributed system into
      partitions such that nodes in one partition cannot communicate
      with the nodes in the other partition.

      Sometimes, partitions are partial or asymmetric. An example
      partial partition is the a division of the nodes of a network
      into three sets, where members of the first set cannot
      communicate with members of the second set, and the reverse, but
      all nodes can communicate with members of the third set.
      
      In an
      asymmetric partition, communication may be possible only when it
      originates with certain nodes. For example, nodes on one side of
      the partition can communicate with the other side only if they
      originate the communications channel.

   node
      An individual :term:`mongod` process. A :term:`replica set` has
      multiple nodes. A node is also known as a :term:`member`.

   noop
      No Operation (noop), is an I/O operation scheduler that allocates
      I/O bandwidth for incoming processes based on a first in, first out 
      queue.

   storage order
      See :term:`natural order`.

   ObjectId
      A 12-byte :term:`BSON` type that is unique
      within a :term:`collection`. The ObjectId is generated using the
      timestamp, computer ID, process ID, and a local process incremental
      counter. MongoDB uses ObjectId values as the default values for
      :term:`_id` fields.

   object identifier
      See :term:`ObjectId`.

   operator
      A keyword beginning with a ``$`` used to express an update,
      complex query, or data transformation. For example, ``$gt`` is the
      query language's "greater than" operator. For available operators,
      see :doc:`/reference/operator`.

   operation log
      See :term:`oplog`.

   operation time
      See :term:`optime`.

   oplog
      A :term:`capped collection` that stores an ordered history of
      logical writes to a MongoDB database. The oplog is the
      basic mechanism enabling :term:`replication` in MongoDB.
      See :doc:`/core/replica-set-oplog`.

   oplog hole
      A temporary gap in the oplog because the oplog writes aren't in
      sequence. Replica set :ref:`primaries <replica-set-primary>` apply
      oplog entries in parallel as a batch operation. As a result,
      temporary gaps in the oplog can occur from entries that aren't
      yet written from a batch.

   oplog window
      .. include:: /includes/replication/fact-oplog-window-definition.rst

   optime
      .. versionchanged:: 3.2

         The following describes the optime format used by
         :rsconf:`protocolVersion: 1 <protocolVersion>`, introduced in
         MongoDB 3.2.

      A reference to a position in the replication :term:`oplog`. The optime
      value is a document that contains:

      .. include:: /includes/fact-optime.rst

   ordered query plan
      A query plan that returns results in the order consistent with the
      :method:`~cursor.sort()` order. See
      :ref:`read-operations-query-optimization`.

   orphaned document
      In a sharded cluster, orphaned documents are those documents on a
      shard that also exist in chunks on other shards. This is caused by
      a failed migration or an incomplete migration cleanup because of
      an atypical shutdown.

      Starting in MongoDB 4.4, orphaned documents are cleaned up
      automatically after a chunk migration completes. You no longer
      need to run :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` to delete orphaned
      documents.

   orphaned cursor
      A cursor that is not correctly closed or iterated over 
      in your application code. Orphaned cursors can cause performance
      issues in your MongoDB deployment.

   passive member
      A member of a :term:`replica set` that cannot become primary
      because its :rsconf:`members[n].priority` is
      ``0``. See :doc:`/core/replica-set-priority-0-member`.

   percentile
      In a dataset, a percentile is a value where that percentage
      of the data is at or below the specified value. For details, see
      :ref:`percentile-calculation-considerations`.

   PID
      A process identifier. UNIX-like systems assign a unique-integer
      PID to each running process. You can use a PID to inspect a
      running process and send signals to it. See
      :ref:`proc-file-system`.

   pipe
      A communication channel in UNIX-like systems allowing independent
      processes to send and receive data. In the UNIX shell, piped
      operations allow users to direct the output of one command into
      the input of another.

   pipeline
      A series of operations in an :term:`aggregation`.
      See :ref:`aggregation-pipeline`.

   Point
      A single coordinate pair as described in the GeoJSON Point
      specification: `<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.2>`_. To
      use a Point in MongoDB, see
      :ref:`geospatial-indexes-store-geojson`.

   Polygon
      An array of :term:`LinearRing <LineString>` coordinate arrays, as
      described in the GeoJSON Polygon specification:
      `<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.6>`_. For Polygons
      with multiple rings, the first must be the exterior ring and
      any others must be interior rings or holes.

      MongoDB does not permit the exterior ring to self-intersect.
      Interior rings must be fully contained within the outer loop and
      cannot intersect or overlap with each other. See
      :ref:`geospatial-indexes-store-geojson`.

   post-image document
      A document after it was inserted, replaced, or updated. See
      :ref:`db.collection.watch-change-streams-pre-and-post-images-example`.

   powerOf2Sizes
      A setting for each collection that allocates space for each
      :term:`document` to maximize storage reuse and reduce
      fragmentation. ``powerOf2Sizes`` is the default for :ref:`TTL
      Collections <ttl-collections>`. To change collection settings, see
      :dbcommand:`collMod`.

   prefix compression
      Reduces memory and disk consumption by storing any identical index
      key prefixes only once, per page of memory. See:
      :ref:`storage-wiredtiger-compression` for more about WiredTiger's
      compression behavior.

   pre-image document
      A document before it was replaced, updated, or deleted. See
      :ref:`db.collection.watch-change-streams-pre-and-post-images-example`.

   pre-splitting
      An operation performed before inserting data that divides the
      range of possible shard key values into chunks to facilitate easy
      insertion and high write throughput. In some cases pre-splitting
      expedites the initial distribution of documents in :term:`sharded
      cluster` by manually dividing the collection rather than waiting
      for the MongoDB :term:`balancer` to do so. See
      :doc:`/tutorial/create-chunks-in-sharded-cluster`.

   primary
      In a :term:`replica set`, the primary is the member that
      receives all write operations. See
      :ref:`replica-set-primary-member`.

   primary key
      A record's unique immutable identifier. In :term:`RDBMS` software, the primary
      key is typically an integer stored in each row's ``id`` field.
      In MongoDB, the :term:`_id` field stores a document's primary
      key, which is typically a BSON :term:`ObjectId`.

   primary shard
      The :term:`shard` that stores all the unsharded collections. See
      :ref:`primary-shard`.

   priority
      A configurable value that helps determine which members in
      a :term:`replica set` are most likely to become :term:`primary`.
      See :rsconf:`members[n].priority`.

   privilege
      A combination of specified :term:`resource <resource>` and
      :term:`actions <action>` permitted on the resource. See
      :ref:`privilege <privileges>`.

   projection
      A document supplied to a :term:`query` that specifies the fields
      MongoDB returns in the result set. For more information about projections,
      see :ref:`projection` and
      :doc:`/reference/operator/projection`.

   query
      A read request. MongoDB uses a :term:`JSON` form of query language
      that includes :term:`query operators <operator>` with
      names that begin with a ``$`` character. In
      :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, you can run queries using the
      :method:`db.collection.find()` and
      :method:`db.collection.findOne()` methods. See
      :ref:`read-operations-queries`.

   query framework
      A combination of the :term:`query optimizer` and query execution engine 
      that processes an operation.

   query operator
      A keyword beginning with ``$`` in a query. For example,
      :query:`$gt` is the "greater than" operator. For a list of
      query operators, see :ref:`query operators <query-selectors>`.

   query optimizer
      A process that generates query plans. For each query, the
      optimizer generates a plan that matches the query to the index
      that returns the results as efficiently as possible. The
      optimizer reuses the query plan each time the query runs. If a
      collection changes significantly, the optimizer creates a new
      query plan. See :ref:`read-operations-query-optimization`.

   query plan
      Most efficient execution plan chosen by the query planner. For
      more details, see :ref:`query-plans-query-optimization`.

   query shape
      A combination of query predicate, sort, projection, and
      :ref:`collation <collation>`. The query shape allows MongoDB 
      to identify logically equivalent queries and analyze their performance.

      For the query predicate, only the structure of the predicate,
      including the field names, are significant. The values in the
      query predicate are insignificant. Therefore, a query predicate ``{
      type: 'food' }`` is equivalent to the query predicate ``{ type:
      'utensil' }`` for a query shape.

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-query-shapes.rst

   range                                                                    
      A contiguous range of :term:`shard key` values within a               
      chunk. Data ranges include the lower boundary and             
      exclude the upper boundary. MongoDB migrates data when a              
      shard contains :ref:`too much data of a collection                    
      <sharding-migration-thresholds>` relative to other shards.            
      See :ref:`sharding-data-partitioning` and                             
      :ref:`sharding-balancing`.  

   read concern
      Specifies a level of isolation for read operations. For example,
      you can use read concern to only read data that has propagated to
      a majority of nodes in a :term:`replica set`. See
      :doc:`/reference/read-concern`.

   read preference
      A setting that determines how clients direct read operations.
      Read preference affects all replica sets, including shard replica
      sets. By default, MongoDB directs reads to :term:`primaries
      <primary>`. However, you may also direct reads to secondaries for
      :term:`eventually consistent <eventual consistency>` reads. See
      :ref:`Read Preference <read-preference>`.

   read lock
      A shared :term:`lock` on a resource such as a collection or
      database that, while held, allows concurrent readers but no
      writers. See :ref:`faq-concurrency-locking`.

   RDBMS
      Relational Database Management System. A database management
      system based on the relational model, typically using :term:`SQL`
      as the query language.

   recovering
      A :term:`replica set` member status indicating that a member
      is not ready to begin activities of a secondary or primary.
      Recovering members are unavailable for reads.

   replica set
      A cluster of MongoDB servers that implements
      replication and automated failover. MongoDB's recommended
      replication strategy. See :doc:`/replication`.

   replication
      A feature allowing multiple database servers to share the same
      data. Replication ensures data redundancy and enables load
      balancing. See :doc:`/replication`.

   replication lag
      The time period between the last operation in the
      :term:`primary's <primary>` :term:`oplog` and the last operation
      applied to a particular :term:`secondary`. You typically want
      replication lag as short as possible. See :ref:`Replication
      Lag <replica-set-replication-lag>`.

   resident memory
      The subset of an application's memory currently stored in
      physical RAM. Resident memory is a subset of :term:`virtual memory`,
      which includes memory mapped to physical RAM and to storage.

   resource
     A database, collection, set of collections, or cluster. A
     :term:`privilege` permits :term:`actions <action>` on a specified
     resource. See :ref:`resource <resource-document>`.

   role
     A set of privileges that permit :term:`actions <action>` on
     specified :term:`resources <resource>`. Roles assigned to a user
     determine the user's access to resources and operations. See
     :doc:`/security`.

   rollback
      A process that reverts write operations to ensure the consistency
      of all replica set members. See :ref:`replica-set-rollback`.

   secondary
      A :term:`replica set` member that replicates the contents of the
      master database. Secondary members may run read requests, but
      only the :term:`primary` members can run write operations. See
      :ref:`replica-set-secondary-members`.

   secondary index
      A database :term:`index` that improves query performance by
      minimizing the amount of work that the query engine must perform
      to run a query. See :doc:`/indexes`.

   secondary member
      See :term:`secondary`. Also known as a secondary node.

   seed list
      A seed list is used by drivers and clients (like
      :binary:`~bin.mongosh`) for initial discovery of the replica 
      set configuration. Seed lists can be provided as a list of 
      ``host:port`` pairs (see :ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format`
      or through DNS entries. For more information, see :ref:`connections-dns-seedlist`.

   set name
      The arbitrary name given to a replica set. All members of a
      replica set must have the same name specified with the
      :setting:`~replication.replSetName` setting or the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option.

   shard
      A single :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance or :term:`replica set`
      that stores part of a :term:`sharded cluster's <sharded cluster>`
      total data set. Typically, in a production deployment, ensure all
      shards are part of replica sets. See
      :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-shards`.

   shard key
      The field MongoDB uses to distribute documents among members of a
      :term:`sharded cluster`. See :ref:`shard-key`.

   sharded cluster
      The set of nodes comprising a :term:`sharded <sharding>` MongoDB
      deployment. A sharded cluster consists of config servers,
      shards, and one or more :binary:`~bin.mongos`
      routing processes. See :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-components`.

   sharding
      A database architecture that partitions data by key ranges and
      distributes the data among two or more database instances.
      Sharding enables horizontal scaling. See :doc:`/sharding`.

   shell helper
      A method in ``mongosh`` that has a concise
      syntax for a :doc:`database command <command>`. Shell helpers
      improve the interactive experience. See
      :doc:`/reference/method`.

   single-master replication
      A :term:`replication` topology where only a single database
      instance accepts writes. Single-master replication ensures
      consistency and is the replication topology used by MongoDB.
      See :doc:`/core/replica-set-primary`.

   snapshot
      .. include:: /includes/snapshot-definition.rst

   snappy
      A compression/decompression library to balance
      efficient computation requirements with reasonable compression rates.
      Snappy is the default compression
      library for MongoDB's use of :ref:`WiredTiger
      <storage-wiredtiger>`. See `Snappy
      <https://google.github.io/snappy/>`_ and the :wtdocs-v5.0:`WiredTiger compression
      documentation </compression.html>`
      for more information.

   split
      The division between :term:`chunks <chunk>` in a :term:`sharded
      cluster`. See :doc:`/core/sharding-data-partitioning`.

   SQL
      Structured Query Language (SQL) is used for interaction with
      relational databases.

   SSD
      Solid State Disk. High-performance storage that uses solid
      state electronics for persistence instead of rotating platters
      and movable read/write heads used by mechanical hard drives.

   standalone
      An instance of :binary:`~bin.mongod` that runs as a single server
      and not as part of a :term:`replica set`. To convert it to a
      replica set, see
      :doc:`/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set`.

   stash collection
      A temporary collection that may be created during
      :ref:`resharding <sharding-resharding>`. When resharding completes
      successfully, any stash collections that were created are removed
      during the operation.

   storage engine
      The part of a database that is responsible for managing how data
      is stored and accessed, both in memory and on disk. Different
      storage engines perform better for specific workloads. See
      :doc:`/core/storage-engines` for specific details on the built-in
      storage engines in MongoDB.

   Subject Alternative Name
      Subject Alternative Name (SAN) is an extension of the X.509 
      certificate which allows an array of values such as IP addresses 
      and domain names that specify the resources a single security 
      certificate may secure.

   strict consistency
      A property of a distributed system requiring that all members
      contain the latest changes to the system. In a database
      system, this means that any system that can provide data must
      contain the latest writes.

   sync
      The :term:`replica set` operation where members replicate data
      from the :term:`primary`. Sync first occurs when MongoDB creates
      or restores a member, which is called :term:`initial sync`. Sync
      then occurs continually to keep the member updated with changes to
      the replica set's data. See :doc:`/core/replica-set-sync`.

   syslog
      On UNIX-like systems, a logging process that provides a uniform
      standard for servers and processes to submit logging information.
      MongoDB provides an option to send output to the host’s syslog
      system. See :setting:`~systemLog.syslogFacility`.

   tag
     A label applied to a replica set member and used by
     clients to issue data-center-aware operations. For more information
     on using tags with replica sets, see :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets`.

     In MongoDB 3.4, sharded cluster :term:`zones <zone>` replace
     :term:`tags <tag>`.

   tag set
     A document containing zero or more :term:`tags <tag>`.

   tailable cursor
     For a :term:`capped collection`, a tailable cursor is a cursor that
     remains open after the client exhausts the results in the initial
     cursor. As clients insert new documents into the capped collection,
     the tailable cursor continues to retrieve documents.

   term
      For the members of a replica set, a monotonically increasing
      number that corresponds to an election attempt.

   time series collection
      A :term:`collection <collection>` that efficiently stores
      sequences of measurements over a period of time. See
      :doc:`/core/timeseries-collections`.

   topology
     The state of a deployment of MongoDB instances. Includes:

     - Type of deployment (standalone, replica set, or sharded cluster).
     - Availability of servers.
     - Role of each server (:term:`primary`, :term:`secondary`,
       :term:`config server`, or :binary:`~bin.mongos`).

   transaction
      Group of read or write operations. For details, see
      :ref:`transactions`.

   transaction coordinator
      A component of MongoDB that manages :term:`transactions
      <transaction>` in a :term:`replica set` or a :term:`sharded
      cluster`. It coordinates the execution and completion of
      multi-document transactions across nodes and allows a complex
      operation to be treated as an :term:`atomic operation`.

   TSV
      A text-based data format consisting of tab-separated values.
      This format is commonly used to exchange data between relational
      databases because the format is suited to tabular data. You can
      import TSV files using :binary:`~bin.mongoimport`.

   TTL
      Time-to-live (TTL) is an expiration time or
      period for a given piece of information to remain in a cache or
      other temporary storage before the system deletes it or ages it
      out. MongoDB has a TTL collection feature. See
      :doc:`/tutorial/expire-data`.
   
   unbounded array
     An array that consistently grows larger over time. If a document
     field value is an unbounded array, the array may negatively impact
     performance. In general, design your schema to avoid unbounded
     arrays.

   unique index
      An index that enforces uniqueness for a particular field in
      a single collection. See :ref:`index-type-unique`.

   unordered query plan
      A query plan that returns results in an order inconsistent with the
      :method:`~cursor.sort()` order.
      See :ref:`read-operations-query-optimization`.

   upsert
      An option for update operations. For example:
      :method:`db.collection.updateOne()`,
      :method:`db.collection.findAndModify()`. If upsert is ``true``,
      the update operation either:

      - updates the document(s) matched by the query.
      - or if no documents match, inserts a new document. The new
        document has the field values specified in the update operation.
      
      For more information about upserts, see :ref:`upsert-parameter`.

   virtual memory
      An application's working memory, typically residing on both
      disk and in physical RAM.

   WGS84
      The default reference system and geodetic datum that MongoDB uses
      to calculate geometry over an Earth-like sphere for geospatial
      queries on :term:`GeoJSON` objects. See the
      "EPSG:4326: WGS 84" specification:
      `<http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/>`_.

   window operator
      Returns values from a span of documents from a collection. See
      :ref:`window operators <setWindowFields-window-operators>`.

   working set
      The data that MongoDB uses most often.

   write concern
      Specifies whether a write operation has succeeded. Write concern
      allows your application to detect insertion errors or unavailable
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. For :term:`replica sets <replica
      set>`, you can configure write concern to confirm replication to a
      specified number of members. See :doc:`/reference/write-concern`.

   write conflict
      A situation where two concurrent operations, at least one of which
      is a write, try to use a resource that violates the
      constraints for a storage engine that uses optimistic
      :term:`concurrency control`. MongoDB automatically ends and
      retries one of the conflicting write operations.

   write lock
      An exclusive :term:`lock` on a resource such as a collection
      or database. When a process writes to a resource, it takes
      an exclusive write lock to prevent other processes from writing
      to or reading from that resource. For more information on
      locks, see :doc:`/faq/concurrency`.

   writeBacks
      The process in the sharding system that ensures writes
      sent to a :term:`shard` that *is not* responsible for the
      relevant chunk are applied to the correct shard. For more
      information, see :ref:`faq-writebacklisten` and
      :ref:`server-status-writebacksqueued`.

   zlib
      A data compression library that provides higher compression rates
      at the cost of more CPU, compared to MongoDB's use of
      :term:`snappy`. You can configure :ref:`WiredTiger
      <storage-wiredtiger>` to use zlib as its compression library. See
      http://www.zlib.net and the :wtdocs-v5.0:`WiredTiger compression documentation
      </compression.html>` for more
      information.

   zstd
      .. versionadded:: 4.2

      A data compression library that provides higher compression rates
      and lower CPU usage when compared to :term:`zlib`.

   zone
      A grouping of documents based on ranges of :term:`shard key` values
      for a given sharded collection. Each shard in the sharded cluster can
      be in one or more zones. In a balanced cluster, MongoDB
      directs reads and writes for a zone only to those shards
      inside that zone. See the :ref:`zone-sharding` manual page for more
      information.

      Zones supersede functionality described by :term:`tags <tag>` in MongoDB 3.2.
