``mongos`` and Earlier Versions of ``mongod`` Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version |newversion| :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances cannot connect to
earlier versions of :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

The 3.2 and earlier ``mongo`` shell is not compatible with 3.4
clusters.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Version |oldversion| or Greater
    To upgrade a sharded cluster to |newversion|, **all** members of the
    cluster must be at least version |oldversion|. The upgrade process checks
    all components of the cluster and will produce warnings if any
    component is running version earlier than |oldversion|.

- Config Server as Replica Set (CSRS)
    Starting in |newversion|, the use of the deprecated mirrored
    :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances as config servers (SCCC) is no longer
    supported.
    
    Before you can upgrade your sharded clusters to 3.4, you must
    convert your config servers from SCCC to a replica set (CSRS). To
    convert your config servers from SCCC to CSRS, see :v3.4:`Upgrade
    Config Servers to Replica Set
    </tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set>`.


- :ref:`Disable the balancer <sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily>`

- Back up the ``config`` Database
    *Optional but Recommended.* As a precaution, take a backup of the
    ``config`` database *before* upgrading the sharded cluster.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Use Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download |newversion| Binaries Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.
