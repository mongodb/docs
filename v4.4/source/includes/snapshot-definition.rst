A snapshot is a complete copy of the data in a :binary:`mongod` instance
at a specific point in time. You can retrieve snapshot metadata for the
whole cluster or replica set, or for a single config server in a
cluster. For more details, see `snapshots
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cloud-manager/reference/api/snapshots>`__.
