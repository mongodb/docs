Back up a Deployment

   :description: Enable backups for MongoDB deployments using Cloud Manager, ensuring prerequisites like unique deployment names and specific replica set or sharded cluster configurations.

You can back up your MongoDB deployment.

.. important::

Considerations
--------------

|mms| builds snapshots using the
:manual:`latest patch release of MongoDB </reference/versioning>`.

.. example::

   Consider a deployment where the current MongoDB version is
   4.0.20.

   If you back up a database running MongoDB 4.0.15, |mms| creates
   the snapshot using MongoDB 4.0.20, the current version. |mms|
   displays that snapshot as MongoDB 4.0.20 in the console.

   MongoDB guarantees all patch release versions to be compatible.
   You can use the snapshots built with 4.0.20 to restore to your
   4.0.15 instances, if needed.

Prerequisites
-------------

Unique Names for Deployment Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure your deployment items have unique names before creating backups.

.. include:: /includes/important-unique-names-deployment-items.rst

Replica Set Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Replica Set must:

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: FCV 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      - Be monitored by |mms|.

      - Run MongoDB Enterprise with |fcv| 4.2 or later.

      - Have an active :manual:`primary </reference/glossary/#std-term-primary>` node.

      - Have one node with :manual:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>` set
        as its :ref:`storage engine <considerations-backup-storage-engine>`.

   .. tab:: FCV 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      - Be monitored by |mms|.

      - Run MongoDB version 2.6 to 4.0.

      - Have an active :manual:`primary </reference/glossary/#std-term-primary>` node.

Sharded Cluster Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Sharded Cluster must:

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: FCV 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      - Be monitored by |mms|.

      - Run MongoDB Enterprise with |fcv| 4.2 or later on all
        nodes including the config server.

      - Have an active :manual:`primary </reference/glossary/#std-term-primary>` node of each shard and the
        config server.

      - Have one node per shard or config server with
        :manual:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>` set as its
        :ref:`storage engine <considerations-backup-storage-engine>`.
        
   .. tab:: FCV 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      - Be monitored by |mms| including at least one |mongos| in the
        cluster.

      - Run MongoDB version 2.6 to 4.0.

      - Have all :manual:`config servers  </reference/glossary/#std-term-config-server>` running. The
        config server |mongod| processes must be started with either
        the ``--configsvr`` command line option or the
        ``{ "clusterRole": "configsvr" }`` setting in the ``mongod``
        configuration file.

      - Complete the balancing round in less than one hour.

MongoDB FCV 4.2 Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All |fcv| 4.2 and later databases must fulfill the appropriate
:ref:`backup considerations <4.2-backup-considerations>`.

Procedure
---------

.. tabs::
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: FCV 4.2 or later
      :tabid: fcv42

      You can back up your entire MongoDB deployment.

      .. include:: /includes/steps-create-backup-wt.rst

   .. tab:: FCV 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      You can choose to back up all databases and collections in your
      MongoDB deployment or specific ones.
