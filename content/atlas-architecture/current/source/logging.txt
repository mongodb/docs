Accessing Audit Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the {+atlas-cli+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, or {+atlas-ui+} for the following auditing activities: 

- :ref:`View and download audit logs <set-up-database-auditing>` to track :ref:`system event actions <audit-action-details-results>`
  for deployments with multiple users. {+service+} administrators can configure a custom auditing filter to 
  choose the actions, database users, {+service+} roles, and |ldap| groups that they want to audit.

- :ref:`View and download MongoDB logs <mongodb-logs>` to track log events for your deployment, including incoming connections, 
  commands run, and issues encountered. Generally, log messages are useful for diagnosing issues, monitoring your deployment, and tuning performance.

- :ref:`View project and organization events <view-activity-feed>` in the :guilabel:`Project Activity Feed`
  and :guilabel:`Organization Activity Feed`. These activity feeds list all events at the organization or project level, including 
  changes related to {+service+} access, alert configurations and monitoring, billing, and more.  

- :ref:`View database authentication attempts <access-tracking>` that users make against your {+cluster+} in your access logs 
  (i.e. :guilabel:`Database access history` in the {+atlas-ui+}).
  |service| logs both successful and unsuccessful authentication attempts,
  including the timestamp of each attempt and which user tried to authenticate.

Programmatic Access to Audit Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To integrate with tools beyond the built-in integrations, we recommend
that you retrieve logs with the following programmatic tools and feed
the |json|-formatted output to your external tools:

- To continually export logs to an |aws| |s3| bucket, use the {+atlas-admin-api+}
  endpoint for :oas-bump-atlas-op:`Create One Log Integration <creategrouplogintegration>`.
- To retrieve deployment logs and lists of project events,
  use the {+atlas-admin-api+} endpoints for :oas-bump-atlas-tag:`Monitoring and Logs <monitoring-and-logs>`
  and :oas-bump-atlas-tag:`Project and Organization Events <events>`.
- To retrieve deployment logs, use the :ref:`atlas deployment logs <atlas-deployments-logs>`
  command in the {+atlas-cli+}.

Recommendations for {+service+} Logging
---------------------------------------

The following recommendations apply to all :ref:`deployment paradigms
<arch-center-paradigms>`.

To perform a full audit, 
you can use a combination of :manual:`audit logs </reference/audit-message/>`, 
:manual:`MongoDB log messages </reference/log-messages/>`, 
and :ref:`the project and organization activity feed <view-activity-feed>`.

By default, audit log messages are returned in a format designed by MongoDB, 
called the :manual:`mongo schema </reference/audit-message/mongo/>`. 
Audit log messages that follow the ``mongo`` schema always include the following information:

- Action type (``atype``)
- Timestamp 
- Client connection ID (UUID) 
- Client IP address and port number
- Incoming connection IP address and port number
- Username(s)
- User authentication database(s)
- User role(s)
- User role database(s)
- ``param`` document containing specific details for the event 
- Result value or error code

For a full list of audit action types and their associated ``param`` details and ``result`` values, 
see :manual:`mongo Schema Audit Messages </reference/audit-message/mongo/>`. 

Automation Examples: {+service+} Logging
----------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/complete-examples-terraform.rst

The following examples show how to retrieve and download logs and configure auditing
using |service| :ref:`tools for automation <arch-center-automation>`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: CLI
      :tabid: cli

      You can retrieve logs and download logs. You can also retrieve alerts.
      
      - Retrieving logs allows you to get logs for real-time viewing and
        accessing of current log files.
      
      - Downloading logs lets you create a log archive from MongoDB |service|
        for later analysis or storage.

      Retrieve Logs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Retrieve logs to monitor and examine your cluster's activity in
      real-time and to  troubleshoot an issue in current logs.

      Each |mongod| and |mongos| instance in a cluster outputs its own
      :manual:`MongoDB log </reference/log-messages/>` and audit log messages
      with potentially different contents than other instances.
      You can view these log messages in the {+atlas-cli+} using the
      :ref:`atlas deployment logs <atlas-deployments-logs>` command.

      To retrieve audit log entries for a |mongod| instance in your cluster,
      provide the |mongod| hostname and specify ``mongodb-audit-log.gz``
      as the name of the audit log file:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli/cli-example-retrieve-audit-logs-mongod.rst

      To retrieve audit log entries for a |mongos| instance in a sharded cluster,
      provide the |mongos| hostname and specify ``mongos-audit-log.gz`` as the name of the audit log file: 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli/cli-example-retrieve-audit-logs-mongos.rst

      To retrieve :manual:`MongoDB log messages </reference/log-messages/>`,
      provide the hostname of your |mongod| or |mongos| instance,
      and specify the name of the log file as ``mongodb.gz`` or ``mongos.gz``, respectively:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli/cli-example-retrieve-logs.rst

      You can also use the :ref:`atlas accessLogs list <atlas-accessLogs-list>`
      command to view the access log for a node or cluster.
      The access log is a |json|-formatted list of all authentication
      requests against your specified node or cluster. 
      
      To retrieve the access log, run the :ref:`atlas accessLogs list <atlas-accessLogs-list>` command 
      and specify the hostname or {+cluster+} name of the target node or {+cluster+}: 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli/cli-example-retrieve-access-logs.rst

      Download Logs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
      Download logs to focus on historical logs and analyze them for audits
      or performance, or to archive them.

      Each |mongod| and |mongos| instance in a cluster has its own
      :manual:`MongoDB log </reference/log-messages/>` and audit log
      with potentially different contents than other instances.
      Even though, from the perspective of the application, a |mongod|
      or a |mongos| instance behaves identically to any other MongoDB
      instance, their logs contain information specific to their roles in MongoDB.

      - The logs for |mongod| contain data requests, data access information,
        and background management operations for MongoDB.
      - The logs for |mongos| contain information about routing queries
        and write operations to the shards in a sharded cluster.

      You can download each log as a compressed file using the 
      :ref:`atlas logs download <atlas-deployments-logs>` {+atlas-cli+} command. 

      To download the audit log for a |mongod| instance in your cluster, 
      provide the |mongod| hostname and the audit log file name ``mongodb-auditlog.gz`` as arguments.
      The name of this file is used here as an example and you can use another name.

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli/cli-example-download-audit-logs-mongod.rst

      To download the audit log for a |mongos| instance in a sharded cluster deployment, 
      provide the |mongos| hostname and the audit log file name ``mongos-auditlog.gz`` as arguments.
      The name of this file is used here as an example and you can use another name.

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli/cli-example-download-audit-logs-mongos.rst

      To download the :manual:`MongoDB log </reference/log-messages/>`
      for a |mongod| or |mongos| instance, provide as arguments the hostname
      of the instance and the log file names ``mongodb.gz`` or ``mongos.gz``,
      respectively:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli/cli-example-download-logs.rst

      Retrieve All Project Alerts
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      You can use the following {+atlas-cli+} commands to return alerts triggered by
      events for your project or organization. {+service+} provides alerts such as
      :alert:`Replica set has no primary` and :alert:`User joined the project` by
      default. These events provide a record of significant activities
      and changes within the project or organization, including significant
      database, billing, or security activities or status changes.
      
      To customize which events trigger alerts for your project and organization,
      see :ref:`configure-alerts`.

      Retrieve All Log Events for Your Project or Organization
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      You can use the following {+atlas-cli+} commands to return project
      or organization events from your :guilabel:`Project Activity Feed`
      or :guilabel:`Organization Activity Feed`.
 
      To return all events for your organization, use the :ref:`atlas events organizations list <atlas-events-organizations-list>` 
      command and specify your organization ID. The following command returns a JSON-formatted list of events for the
      organization with the ID ``5dd5a6b6f10fab1d71a58495``:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli/cli-example-retrieve-logs-org.rst

      To return all events for your project, use the :ref:`atlas events projects list <atlas-events-projects-list>` 
      command and specify your project ID. The following command returns a JSON-formatted list of events for the
      project with the ID ``64ac57bfe9810c0263e9d655``:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli/cli-example-retrieve-logs-org.rst

      Download All Query Logs for an Entire Cluster
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      To download query logs for an entire cluster, obtain the required
      permissions, select your cluster in the {+atlas-ui+}, click
      :guilabel:`Online Archive`, and run: 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli/cli-example-download-all-cluster-logs.rst

   .. tab:: Terraform
      :tabid: Terraform
 
      Retrieve Logs
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      You can't retrieve logs with Terraform. Instead, use the following
      {+atlas-admin-api+} endpoints:

      - Use :oas-bump-atlas-tag:`Access Tracking Admin API <access-tracking>`
        to return access logs for all authentication attempts for the database,
        identified by the cluster's name or hostname.

      - Use :oas-bump-atlas-tag:`Monitoring and Logs APIs <monitoring-and-logs>`
        to retrieve a compressed log file with log messages for the specified
        host.
