|service| runs an index sufficiency query during the first archive run to
determine the efficiency of the archival process. If the number of documents scanned to
the number of documents returned is 10 or more, the query result triggers an ``Index
Sufficiency Warning``. This warning indicates that you have insufficient indexes for an
efficient archival process. For date-based archives, you must index the date field. For
custom criteria that use an expression, |service| might first convert a value before it
evaluates it against the query.

.. note::

   The index sufficiency query stops running after sufficient indexes are detected. If an index on
   the collection gets dropped later and slows down the archiving process, |service| does not issue
   an ``Index Sufficiency Warning``.
