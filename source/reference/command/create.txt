Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: create

   Explicitly creates a collection or view.

   .. note::

      The view created by this command does not refer to materialized
      views. For discussion of on-demand materialized views, see
      :pipeline:`$merge` instead.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments:

Syntax
------

The ``create`` command has the following syntax:

.. note::
   
   MongoDB 6.3 adds the ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` and
   ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` parameters. To downgrade below 6.3, you
   must either drop all collections with these parameters, or modify
   them to use the corresponding ``granularity``, if possible. For 
   details see :dbcommand:`collMod`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
        create: <collection or view name>,
        capped: <true|false>,
        timeseries: {
           timeField: <string>,
           metaField: <string>,
           granularity: <string>,
           bucketMaxSpanSeconds: <timespan>,  // Added in MongoDB 6.3
           bucketRoundingSeconds: <timespan>  // Added in MongoDB 6.3
        },
        expireAfterSeconds: <number>,

Command Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``create`` command has the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 20 75
 
   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
 
   * - ``create``
     - string
     - The name of the new collection or view. See
       :ref:`restrictions-on-db-names`. If you try to create a
       collection or view that already exists and you provide identical
       options for that existing collection or view, no action is taken
       and success is returned.
       
   * - ``capped``
     - boolean
     - Optional. To create a :term:`capped collection`,
       specify ``true``. If you specify ``true``, you must also set a maximum
       size in the ``size`` field.
 
 
 
   * - ``timeseries.timeField``
     - string
     - Required when creating a :term:`time series collection`. The
       name of the field which contains the date in each time series
       document. Documents in a time series collection must have a
       valid BSON date as the value for the ``timeField``.
 
   * - ``timeseries.metaField``
     - string
     - .. include:: /includes/time-series/fact-meta-field-description.rst
 
   * - ``timeseries.granularity``
 
     - string
 
     - Optional, do not use if setting ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` and 
       ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds``. Possible values are ``seconds`` (default), ``minutes``, and ``hours``.
     
       Set ``granularity`` to the value that most closely matches 
       the time between consecutive incoming timestamps. This improves 
       performance by optimizing how MongoDB internally stores data in 
       the collection.

       For more information on granularity and bucket intervals, see 
       :ref:`timeseries-granularity`.



   * - ``timeseries.bucketMaxSpanSeconds``
 
     - integer
 
     - Optional, used with ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` as an alternative
       to ``granularity``. Sets the maximum time between timestamps in
       the same bucket. Possible values are 1-31536000. If you set
       ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds``, you must set ``bucketRoundingSeconds``
       to the same value.

       To downgrade below MongoDB 6.3, you must either modify the
       collection to use the corresponding ``granularity`` value, or
       drop the collection. For details, see :dbcommand:`collMod`.


   * - ``timeseries.bucketRoundingSeconds``
 
     - integer
 
     - Optional, used with ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` as an alternative to
       ``granularity``. Sets the number of seconds to round down by when
       MongoDB sets the minimum timestamp for a new bucket. Must be
       equal to ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds``

       For example, setting both parameters to ``1800`` rounds new
       buckets down to the nearest 30 minutes. If a document with a time
       of ``2023-03-27T18:24:35Z`` does not fit an
       existing bucket, MongoDB creates a new bucket with a minimum time
       of ``2023-03-27T18:00:00Z`` and a maximum time of ``2023-03-27T18:30:00Z``.



   * - ``expireAfterSeconds``
 
     - integer
 
     - Optional. Specifies the seconds after which documents in a
       :term:`time series collection` or :term:`clustered collection`
       expire. MongoDB deletes expired documents automatically.
 
 

   * - ``clusteredIndex``
     - document
     - .. _create.clusteredIndex:
 
       .. include:: /includes/clustered-index-fields.rst
 
 
 
   * - ``changeStreamPreAndPostImages``
     - document
     - .. _create.changeStreamPreAndPostImages:
 
       .. include:: /includes/change-stream-pre-and-post-images-field.rst
 
       For a ``create`` example on this page, see
       :ref:`create-change-stream-pre-and-post-images-example`.
 
       .. versionadded:: 6.0
       
       
 
   * - ``size``
     - integer
     - Optional. Specify a maximum size in bytes for a capped collection. Once a
       capped collection reaches its maximum size, MongoDB removes the older
       documents to make space for the new documents. The ``size`` field is
       required for capped collections and ignored for other collections.
       
   * - ``max``
     - integer
     - Optional. The maximum number of documents allowed in the capped collection. The
       ``size`` limit takes precedence over this limit. If a capped
       collection reaches the ``size`` limit before it reaches the maximum
       number of documents, MongoDB removes old documents. If you prefer to
       use the ``max`` limit, ensure that the ``size`` limit, which is
       required for a capped collection, is sufficient to contain the
       maximum number of documents.
 
   * - ``storageEngine``
     - document
     - Optional. Available for the WiredTiger storage engine only.
 
       Allows users to specify configuration to the storage engine on a
       per-collection basis when creating a collection. The value of the
       ``storageEngine`` option should take the following form:
 
       .. code-block:: javascript
 
          { <storage-engine-name>: <options> }
 
       Storage engine configuration specified when creating collections are
       validated and logged to the :term:`oplog` during replication to
       support replica sets with members that use different storage
       engines.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-encryption-options-create-collection.rst
 
       .. seealso::
 
          :ref:`create-command-collection-storage-engine-options`
 
   * - ``validator``
     - document
 
     - Optional. Allows users to specify :ref:`validation rules or
       expressions <schema-validation-overview>` for the collection.
       
       The ``validator`` option takes a document that specifies the
       validation rules or expressions. You can specify the expressions
       using the same operators as the :ref:`query operators
       <query-selectors>` with the exception of :query:`$near`,
       :query:`$nearSphere`, :query:`$text`, and :query:`$where`.
       
       .. note::
       
          - Validation occurs during updates and inserts. Existing
            documents do not undergo validation checks until modification.
       
          - You cannot specify a validator for collections in the ``admin``,
            ``local``, and ``config`` databases.
       
          - You cannot specify a validator for ``system.*`` collections.
 
   * - ``validationLevel``
     - string
     - Optional. Determines how strictly MongoDB applies the
       validation rules to existing documents during an update.
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/table-validationLevel-values.rst
       
   * - ``validationAction``
     - string
     - Optional. Determines whether to ``error`` on invalid documents or just ``warn``
       about the violations but allow invalid documents to be inserted.
       
       .. important::
       
          Validation of documents only applies to those documents as
          determined by the ``validationLevel``.
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/table-validationAction-values.rst
       
   * - ``indexOptionDefaults``
     - document
     - Optional. Allows users to specify a default configuration for indexes when
       creating a collection.
       
       The ``indexOptionDefaults`` option accepts a ``storageEngine``
       document, which should take the following form:
       
       .. code-block:: javascript
       
          { <storage-engine-name>: <options> }
       
       Storage engine configuration specified when creating indexes are
       validated and logged to the :term:`oplog` during replication to
       support replica sets with members that use different storage
       engines.
       
   * - ``viewOn``
     - string
     - The name of the source collection or view from which to create the
       view. The name is not the full namespace of the collection or
       view; i.e. does not include the database name and implies the same
       database as the view to create. You must create views in the same
       database as the source collection.
       
       
       See also :method:`db.createView()`.
       
   * - ``pipeline``
     - array
     - An array that consists of the :ref:`aggregation pipeline stage(s)
       <aggregation-pipeline>`.  ``create`` creates the view by
       applying the specified ``pipeline`` to the ``viewOn`` collection or view.
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-restriction-output-to-disk.rst
               
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-public-definition.rst
       
       See also :method:`db.createView()`.     
 
   * - ``collation``
     - 
     - Specifies the default :ref:`collation <collation>` for the
       collection or the view.
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-description.rst
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-option-specification.rst
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-collection-level.rst
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-unspecified.rst
       
       For a view, if no collation is specified, the view's default
       collation is the "simple" binary comparison collator. For a view on
       a collection, the view does not inherit the collection's collation
       settings. For a view on another view, the to be created view must
       specify the same collation settings.
       
       After you create the collection or the view, you cannot update its
       default collation.
       
       For an example that specifies the default collation during the
       creation of a collection, see :ref:`create-collation-example`.
       
   * - ``writeConcern``
 
     - document
 
     - Optional. A document that expresses the :ref:`write concern <write-concern>`
       for the operation. Omit to use the default write
       concern.
       
       .. include:: /includes/extracts/mongos-operations-wc-create.rst
       
   * - ``encryptedFields``    
     - document
     - Optional. A document that configures :ref:`{+qe+}
       <qe-manual-feature-qe>` for the collection being created.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-encryptedFieldsConfig-intro.rst
       
       For details, see :ref:`<qe-tutorials>`.
       
   * - ``comment``
     - any
     - .. include:: /includes/extracts/comment-content.rst
 
The :method:`db.createCollection()` method and the
:method:`db.createView()` method wrap the ``create``
command.

Behavior
--------

``create`` has the following behavior:

Resource Locking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/create-resource-lock.rst

Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-explicit-ddl.rst

.. |operation| replace:: ``create``

Collection or View with Same Name and Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/createCollection-idempotence.rst

Stable API
~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 5.0

When using :ref:`Stable API <stable-api>` V1, you cannot specify
the following fields in a ``create`` command:

- ``autoIndexId``
- ``capped``
- ``indexOptionDefaults``
- ``max``
- ``size``
- ``storageEngine``

Access Control
--------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/access-control-create-cmd.rst

Examples
--------

Create a Capped Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a :term:`capped collection` limited to 64 kilobytes, issue
the command in the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { create: "collection", capped: true, size: 64 * 1024 } )

Create a Time Series Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a :term:`time series collection` that captures weather data
for the past 24 hours, issue this command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection(
       "weather24h",
       {
          timeseries: {
             timeField: "timestamp",
             metaField: "data",
             granularity: "hours"
          },
          expireAfterSeconds: 86400
       }
   )

Alternately, to create the same collection but limit each bucket to
timestamp values within the same hour, issue this command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection(
       "weather24h",
       {
          timeseries: {
             timeField: "timestamp",
             metaField: "data",
             bucketMaxSpanSeconds: "3600",
             bucketRoundingSeconds: "3600"
          },
          expireAfterSeconds: 86400
       }
   )

.. note::

   In this example ``expireAfterSeconds`` is specified as ``86400``
   which means documents expire ``86400`` seconds after the
   ``timestamp`` value. See :ref:`manual-timeseries-automatic-removal`.

Create a Clustered Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/create-clustered-collection-example.rst

.. _create-change-stream-pre-and-post-images-example:

Create a Collection with Change Stream Pre- and Post-Images for Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/change-stream-pre-and-post-images-introduction.rst

The following example creates a collection that has
:ref:`changeStreamPreAndPostImages
<create.changeStreamPreAndPostImages>` enabled:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( {
      create: "temperatureSensor",
      changeStreamPreAndPostImages: { enabled: true }
   } )

.. include:: /includes/change-stream-pre-and-post-images-additional-information.rst

Create a View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   The view created by this command does not refer to materialized
   views. For discussion of on-demand materialized views, see
   :pipeline:`$merge` instead.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/views-restriction-output-to-disk.rst

To create a :ref:`view <views-landing-page>` using the ``create``
command, use the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { create: <view>, viewOn: <source>, pipeline: <pipeline> } )
   
or if specifying a collation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { create: <view>, viewOn: <source>, pipeline: <pipeline>, collation: <collation> } )

For example, create a ``survey`` collection with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey.insertMany(
      [
         { _id: 1, empNumber: "abc123", feedback: { management: 3, environment: 3 }, department: "A" },
         { _id: 2, empNumber: "xyz987", feedback: { management: 2, environment: 3 }, department: "B" },
         { _id: 3, empNumber: "ijk555", feedback: { management: 3, environment: 4 }, department: "A" }
      ]
   )


The following operation creates a ``managementRatings`` view with the
``_id``, ``feedback.management``, and ``department`` fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand ( {
      create: "managementFeedback",
      viewOn: "survey",
      pipeline: [ { $project: { "management": "$feedback.management", department: 1 } } ]
   } )

.. important::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-public-definition.rst

.. seealso::

   :method:`db.createView()`

.. _create-collation-example:

Specify Collation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify :ref:`collation <collation>` at the collection or
:ref:`view <views-landing-page>` level. For example, the following
operation creates a collection, specifying a collation for the
collection (See :ref:`collation-document-fields` for descriptions of
the collation fields):

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand ( {
      create: "myColl",
      collation: { locale: "fr" }
   });

This collation will be used by indexes and operations that support
collation unless they explicitly specify a different collation. For
example, insert the following documents into ``myColl``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, category: "café" }
   { _id: 2, category: "cafe" }
   { _id: 3, category: "cafE" }

The following operation uses the collection's collation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.myColl.find().sort( { category: 1 } )

The operation returns documents in the following order:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 2, "category" : "cafe" }
   { "_id" : 3, "category" : "cafE" }
   { "_id" : 1, "category" : "café" }

The same operation on a collection that uses simple binary collation
(i.e. no specific collation set) returns documents in the following order:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 3, "category" : "cafE" }
   { "_id" : 2, "category" : "cafe" }
   { "_id" : 1, "category" : "café" }

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`create-view-w-collation`
   - :ref:`ref-collation-and-views`

.. _create-command-collection-storage-engine-options:

Specify Storage Engine Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify collection-specific storage engine configuration
options when you create a collection with
:method:`db.createCollection()`. Consider the following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( {
       create: "users",
       storageEngine: { wiredTiger: { configString: "<option>=<setting>" } }
   } )

This operation creates a new collection named ``users`` with a
specific configuration string that MongoDB will pass to the
``wiredTiger`` storage engine. See the :wtdocs-v5.0:`WiredTiger documentation of
collection level options </struct_w_t___s_e_s_s_i_o_n.html>`
for specific ``wiredTiger`` options.
