       The :guilabel:`Migrate Data to This Cluster` page opens.

    #. Click :guilabel:`Migrate from Ops Manager or Cloud Manager`.
       
       .. note::
        
          The UI label mentions |onprem|, however, for this procedure, you
          can only migrate to |service| MongoDB deployments {+c2c-version+} or later
          that |mms| monitors.
       
       Fill in the fields as follows:

       - Select the source project in |mms|, if it's not already selected.
       - Select the source {+cluster+} from the dropdown.

       - .. include:: /includes/import/sharding-and-index-config.rst

       - Select a migration host for handling the migration.
       - If you aren't using a private endpoint, review the
         IP address access list and check that the migration host's
         external IP address is included in this list. If it's not added,
         add it now:

         - Click :guilabel:`Set Network Access for Host`
         - Click :guilabel:`+ Add IP Address`
         - Return to the Live Migration wizard. Select the source
           cluster from the dropdown and choose
           :guilabel:`Migrate data to this cluster` under :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h`.

       - Select the source {+cluster+} from the drop-down.

       - If the source {+cluster+} enforces authentication, enter a username and
         password into the provided text boxes.

         See :ref:`live-import-c2c-security` for guidance on the
         user permissions required by |service| live migration.

       - If you suspend the source {+cluster+} from automation in |mms|, but
         continue to monitor the source {+cluster+} with the Monitoring Agent,
         the :guilabel:`Username` and :guilabel:`Password` display. If
         your deployment requires user authentication, provide the user
         name and password in these fields. The database user whose
         credentials you provide must have at least the
         :manual:`backup role
         </reference/built-in-roles/#mongodb-authrole-backup>` on
         the admin database and must be authenticated using
         :manual:`both SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-256 </core/security-scram/>`.

       - If the source cluster uses |tls-ssl|, toggle the
         :guilabel:`Is encryption in transit enabled?` button.

       - If the source cluster uses |tls-ssl| with a custom Root
         Certificate Authority (CA), copy the path to the
         :abbr:`CA (Certificate Authority)` file from your migration host
         and paste this path into the provided text box. The file must be
         present on the migration host to ensure the migration host can
         read the certificate. |service| checks that the certificate is
         present and readable.

       - If your destination {+cluster+} has data, and you
         want to preserve it, keep the
         :guilabel:`Clear any existing data on your destination cluster` option
         unchecked. The live migration service warns you if it finds duplicate
         namespaces. If you want to delete the existing data, check this
         option.

       - Choose a connection to connect to the {+cluster+}. The
         :guilabel:`Standard connection` always shows as available in
         the UI. However, other connection options are enabled only if
         you have previously configured a VPC peering connection or a
         private endpoint for your {+clusters+}. If |service| detects that
         you don't have VPC connections or private endpoints configured,
         these options are grayed out.
       
         - If you aren't using VPC peering or a private endpoint, click
           :guilabel:`Standard connection` and proceed to the
           :guilabel:`Validation` stage of this step.

         - If you configured a :ref:`VPC peering connection <vpc-peering>`
           between the migration host and the |service| replica set, the
           :guilabel:`VPC Peering` option is active. Click
           :guilabel:`VPC Peering` to connect using VPC peering for live
           migration. If the :guilabel:`VPC Peering` option is grayed out,
           :ref:`configure a VPC peering connection <vpc-peering>` before
           starting this procedure. To learn more, see
           :ref:`migrate-push-c2c-vpc-support`.

         - If you configured a :ref:`private endpoint <private-endpoint>`
           between the migration host and the |service| {+cluster+}, the
           :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` option is active. Click
           :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` to connect with a
           :ref:`private endpoint <private-endpoint>`, and then select
           a previously-configured private endpoint from the dropdown.
           Only private endpoints that are in ``AVAILABLE`` state are valid.
           If the :guilabel:`Private Endpoint` option is grayed out,
           :ref:`configure a private endpoint <private-endpoint>`
           before starting this procedure. To learn more, see
           :ref:`migrate-push-c2c-vpc-support`.

           .. note::

              .. include:: /includes/fact-private-endpoint-limitations-c2c-push-live-migration.rst

       - Click :guilabel:`Validate`. The validation process verifies that
         your migration host is reachable, and performs the following
         validation checks to ensure that you can start live migration
         to |service|.

         To take advantage of the following validation checks,
         :cloudmgr:`upgrade the MongoDB Agent in Cloud Manager 
         </tutorial/update-mongodb-agent-from-automation-agent/>` to
         the latest version.
         The following validation checks run during the live migration:

         - The migration host can connect to the destination {+cluster+}.
         - If the source cluster uses |tls-ssl| with a custom Root
           Certificate Authority (CA), the migration host can access
           the source cluster using |tls-ssl|.
         - The database user credentials are valid. This validation check
           runs only if you suspend the source cluster from automation in
           |mms|, but continue to monitor the source cluster with the
           Monitoring Agent.

         - The migration process validates that the destination {+cluster+}
           has enough disk space based on the storage size of the compressed
           data. To learn more about data and storage sizes, see
           :manual:`dbStats </reference/command/dbStats/#output>`.

       - If validation fails, check the migration host, the validity of
         your external IP addresses or |cidr| block, and the link-token.
         Also check the database user credentials, your |tls-ssl|
         certificates, and the amount of disk storage size on the destination
         {+cluster+}.
       - If validation succeeds, click :guilabel:`Next`.

   When |service| detects that the source and destination {+clusters+} are
   nearly in sync, it starts an extendable 120 hour (5 day) timer to begin
   the cutover stage of the live migration procedure. After the 120 hour period
   passes, |service| stops synchronizing with the source {+cluster+}. You
   can extend the time remaining by 24 hours by clicking
   :guilabel:`Extend time` below the :guilabel:`<time> left to cut over` timer.

   a. Click :guilabel:`Prepare to Cutover`. |service| displays a walk-through
      screen that states: :guilabel:`Your migration is almost complete!`
      The walk-through screen displays the following instructions on how to
      proceed with the cutover process:

      1. Stop your application. This ensures that no more writes occur on
         the source {+cluster+}.
      2. Wait for the optime gap to reach zero. When the counter reaches
         zero, the source and destination {+clusters+} are in sync.
      3. Check the box that states: :guilabel:`I confirm that I am ready to
         cut over the application to the destination cluser. By proceeding,
         Atlas will finalize the migration. This process will take a
         few seconds. Once it is complete you can point your application
         at the destination cluster and begin writing to it.`

   b. Click :guilabel:`Cutover`.
      |service| completes the migration and displays the :guilabel:`Connect` page.

   c. Decide when to resume writes on the destination {+cluster+}. You can do one of the following:

      - Wait for the banner on your {+cluster+} card to state:
        :guilabel:`Your cluster migration is complete` and then resume writes
        on the destination {+cluster+}. If you choose to wait for the migration
        to complete, your application experiences a temporary pause in writes
        during the time period needed to finalize the migration.

        or

      - Begin application's writes to the destination {+cluster+} without
        waiting for the migration to complete, while your {+cluster+} card
        banner states: :guilabel:`Your destination cluster in Atlas is ready to accept writes, but we are still finalizing the migration.`
        If you choose to move writes to the destination {+cluster+} without
        waiting until the end of the migration process, and live migration fails
        in the final stages and issues an error, you must redirect writes
        back to your source {+cluster+} and restart the live migration process.

   d. When you are ready to redirect writes to the destination {+cluster+} in |service|:

      1. Use the destination {+cluster+}'s connection string to connect to your application.
      2. Confirm that your application is working with the destination |service| {+cluster+}.

   |service| performs these actions to complete the process:

   - Removes the MongoDB live migration server subnets from the IP access
     list on the destination {+cluster+}.
   - Removes the database user that live migration used to import data
     to the destination {+cluster+}.
   - Marks the migration process as complete.
