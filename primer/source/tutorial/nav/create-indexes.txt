.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MongoDB provides several different index types to support different
kinds of queries and data sets.

These examples *only* address scalar indexes, which are the most common
indexes. Scalar indexes store all indexed items in order by value and
support exact matches and efficient range queries. For a complete
discussion of scalar index and other index types, see :manual:`Index
Types Overview </core/index-types>`.

Considerations
--------------

By default, MongoDB automatically creates an index on the ``_id`` field
upon the creation of a collection.

By default, all indexing operations block until the MongoDB finishes
building the index.
