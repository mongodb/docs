The methods listed on this table of contents page are
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` methods.  This is *not* the documentation for
``Node.js`` or other programming language specific driver methods.

In most cases, :binary:`~bin.mongosh` methods work the same way as the
legacy ``mongo`` shell methods. However, some legacy methods
are unavailable in ``mongosh``.

For MongoDB API drivers, refer to the language specific
:driver:`MongoDB driver </>` documentation.
