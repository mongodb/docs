.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: Go to the :guilabel:`Database Deployments` page for your project.

      a. If it is not already displayed, select the organization that
         contains your desired project from the
         :guilabel:`Organizations` menu in the navigation bar.
      #. If it is not already displayed, select your desired project
         from the :guilabel:`Projects` menu in the navigation  bar.
      #. If the :guilabel:`Database Deployments` page is not already
         displayed, click :guilabel:`Database` in the sidebar. 

   .. step:: Go to the {+fts+} page for your {+cluster+}. 
    
      a. Click :guilabel:`Atlas Search` under :guilabel:`Services` in 
         the navigation bar.
      #. Select your {+cluster+} from the :guilabel:`Select data source` 
         dropdown and click :guilabel:`Go to Atlas Search`.

   .. step:: Edit the index.

      a. Locate the ``vectorSearch`` type index to edit.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Edit Index` from the :guilabel:`Actions`
         dropdown for that index.  
      #. Review the current configuration settings and edit them as needed. 
         
         To learn more about the fields in an {+avs+} index, see
         :ref:`avs-types-vector-search`. 
      
      #. Click :guilabel:`Save` to apply the changes. 

      The index's status changes from :guilabel:`Active` to
      :guilabel:`Building`. In this state, you can continue to use the
      old index because {+avs+} does not delete the old index until the
      updated index is ready for use. Once the status returns to
      :guilabel:`Active`, the modified index is ready to use.
