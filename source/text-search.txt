MongoDB Atlas Search
--------------------

For MongoDB Atlas users, MongoDB's Atlas Search supports fine-grained 
text indexing and a rich query language for fast, relevant search 
results. To learn more about full-text search indexes and 
:pipeline:`$search` queries, see: 

- :atlas:`Atlas Search Aggregation Pipeline Stages 
  </reference/atlas-search/query-syntax/>`
- :atlas:`Defining Atlas Search Indexes 
  </reference/atlas-search/index-definitions/>`
- :atlas:`Running Atlas Search Queries 
  </reference/atlas-search/searching/>`

Legacy Text Search 
------------------

For self-managed deployments, MongoDB's legacy text search capability 
supports query operations that perform a text search of string content. 
To perform text search, MongoDB uses a :ref:`text index 
<index-feature-text>` and the :query:`$text` operator.

To learn more about legacy text search for self-managed deployments, 
see: 
      
- :doc:`Text Indexes </core/link-text-indexes/>` 
- :doc:`Text Search Operators </core-text-search-operators/>`

MongoDB also supports text search for various languages. See
:doc:`/reference/text-search-languages` for a list of supported
languages.
