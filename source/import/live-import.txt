|service| can perform a Live Migration of a source replica set to an
|service| cluster, keeping the cluster in sync with the remote source
until you cut your applications over to the |service| cluster.

Once you reach the cutover step in the following procedure, stop
writes to the source cluster: stop your application instances,
point them to the |service| cluster, and restart them.

Restrictions
------------

- You can't select an ``M0`` (Free Tier) or ``M2/M5`` shared cluster
  as the source or target for Live Migration. To migrate data from
  an ``M0`` (Free Tier) or ``M2/M5`` shared cluster to a paid cluster,
  see :doc:`/scale-cluster`.

- Live Migration does not support :ref:`VPC peering <vpc-peering>` or
  :ref:`private endpoints <private-endpoint>` for either the source or
  target cluster.

To live migrate a sharded cluster, see :doc:`/import/live-import-sharded`.

Prerequisites

.. _live-import-upgrade-path:

Upgrade Path
~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| Live Migration supports the following migration paths:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/mongomirror-upgrade-path.rst

.. important::

   If you are migrating from a MongoDB 3.6 cluster, update
   and test your applications in context of the target |service|
   cluster.

.. _live-import-ip-access-list:

.. include:: /includes/import/network-access.rst

.. _live-import-migration-validation:

Pre-Migration Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the Live Migration procedure, |service| runs validation
checks on the source and target clusters.

- The source cluster is a replica set.

  If the source is a standalone,
  :manual:`convert the standalone to a replica set first </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set>`
  before using :doc:`Live Migration </import/live-import>`.

- The target |service| cluster must be a replica set.

.. note::
   Unlike for :ref:`sharded clusters <live-import-sharded-migration-validation>`,
   live migrating your replica set to |service| does not require that
   |service| has connectivity to the hostname and port of each node in the source
   cluster. To run the migration process, |service| automatically
   discovers the hostnames for the replica set based on the hostname you
   provide. If this fails, |service| migrates the replica set using
   your provided reachable hostname. To learn more, see :ref:`Network Access <live-import-ip-access-list>`.

.. _live-import-security:

Source Cluster Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/source-cluster-security.rst

If the source cluster uses a different authentication mechanism to 
connect, you can use :doc:`mongomirror </import/mongomirror>` to 
migrate data from the source cluster to the target |service| cluster.

.. include:: /includes/fact-failIndexKeyTooLong-import.rst

Considerations
--------------

Target Cluster Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When configuring the target cluster, consider the following:

.. include:: /includes/fact-live-migration-destination-cluster.rst

- The target |service| cluster must be a replica set.

- You can't select an ``M0`` (Free Tier) or ``M2/M5`` shared-tier
  cluster as the target cluster for live migration.

- Do **not** change the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` flag while
  |service| Live Migration is running.

Database Users and Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| doesn't migrate any user or role data to the target cluster.

If the source cluster enforced authentication, you must re-create the
credentials used by your applications on the target |service| cluster.
|service| uses :ref:`SCRAM <authentication-scram>` for user authentication.
To learn more, see :doc:`/security-add-mongodb-users`.

Avoid Namespace Changes

Migrate Your Cluster
--------------------

.. note:: Staging and Production Migrations

   Consider running this procedure twice. Run a partial migration
   that stops at the :guilabel:`Perform the Cutover` step *first*. This
   creates an up-to-date |service|-backed staging cluster to test
   application behavior and performance using the latest
   :driver:`driver version </driver-compatibility-reference>` that
   supports the MongoDB version of the |service| cluster.

   After you test your application, run the full migration
   procedure using a separate |service| cluster to create your
   |service|-backed production environment.

.. important::

   Avoid making changes to the source cluster configuration while the
   Live Migration procedure runs, such as removing replica set members
   or modifying :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` runtime settings, such as
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion``.
