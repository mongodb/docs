=====================
Using Geospatial Data
=====================

MongoDB supports rich queries and interaction with geospatial data to
store and query data based on location and proximity. This document
describes how to use geospatial indexes and associated operators. For
more information about the geospatial indexes and its operations see
:doc:`Geospatial Indexes </core/geospatial-indexes>`.

Create Geospatial Indexes
-------------------------

Ensure your geospatial data is stored in a collection in a 2
dimensional array, ``[ x, y ]`` or ``[ y, x ]``. For longitude-latitude data,
``[ latitude, longitude ]`` order is recommended.

To create a geospatial index, use the following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { <location field> : "2d" } )

The field specified by the index must store geospatial
coordinates. The preferred format is:

.. code-block:: javascript

   [ x, y ]

But you may also use an embeded document, as in:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { x: 1, y: 2 }

The order of the coordinates doesn't matter, but you should be
consistent throughout your data set.

.. note:: 
   
   If you use latitude-longitude data as your coordinate system,
   always store latitude values first, MongoDB's spherical queries
   only recognize ``[ latitude, longitude ]`` ordering.

MongoDB will create special index from the location field which will
consist of a special value. All geospatial queries will be against this
geospatial index.

.. note::

   MongoDB only supports 1 geospatial index per collection: any single
   query will only be able to use one index. Furthermore, if a
   collection were to have more than one index, geospatial queries
   cannot return consistent results.

Modify Range
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Geospatial indexes have defaults that support global coordinate data
(i.e. latidude and longitude for points on Earth.) The index is
limited by the boundaries. If you insert documents with
coordinate pairs outside of this boundary, MongoDB will return an
error and reject these documents. The boundaries, by
default, are between -180 inclusive, and 180
non-inclusive, the same as used for global coordinates.

To modify the bounds of the index, use the ``min`` and ``max`` operators
with the :func:`ensureIndex() <db.collection.ensureIndex()>`
operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { <location field>: "2d" } , 
                              { min: <lower bound> , max: <upper bound> } )

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.ensureIndex( { loc: "2d" } , 
                           { min: ­90 , max: 90 } )

Precision
~~~~~~~~~

Geospatial indexes record precision, or resolution, in "bits", which
is configurable during index creation.

If a geospatial index has more bits, then the more precise your index
will be. An index with fewer bits will be faster to query. For more
information, please refer to :doc:`Geospatial Indexes
</core/geospatial-indexes>`

You can change the precision of the geospatial index by
using the bits option when you use the :func:`ensureIndex()
<db.command.ensureIndex()>` function.

MongoDB allocates 26 bits by default for precision, but allows a
maximum of 32 bits. You may use less bits if your geospatial data has
less precision or if you would like faster queries.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( {<location field>: "2d"} , 
                              { bits: <bit precision> } )

Compound Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By using compound indexes, MongoDB can use this index for a larger
portion of operations, which will improve performance. For many
queries, applications need to filter both by location and by another
field. To support these queries, MongoDB permits :term:`compound
indexes` where one component is geospatial data, and other components
are related data.

This is the prototype of the compound index command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { <location field>: "2d" , 
                                <field>: 1 } );

For example, if you have a collection of data that has fields that
describe restaurants' location and its type, a compound index on
these fields would return any query on a restaurant location and type
faster than without a compound index.

Geospatial Haystacking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Geospatial haystack makes it possible to build a special ``bucket``
collection that can better support queries that operate within a
limited area. For more information, please refer to :doc:`Geospatial
Indexes </core/geospatial-indexes>`

Build a geospatial index and specify the ``geoHaystack`` for the
location field and a ``bucketSize`` parameter . The ``bucketSize``
parameter determines the granularity of the bucket index. A
``bucketSize`` of 1 creates an index where keys within 1 unit of
longitude or latitude are stored in the same bucket.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex({ <location field>: "geoHaystack", type: 1 }, 
                             { bucketSize: <bucket value> })

For example, if we want to index all restaurants in a particular area with a
given maximum distance of 6 degrees longitude or latitude to accelerate
searches in this area, create the index using the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.ensureIndex({ loc: "geoHaystack", type: 1} , 
                          { bucketSize: 6 } )

.. TODO verify original wiki: by default, there is a 50 document result limit:
.. this is different than $near (which returns 100 by default)

Querying
--------

There are specific querying options to use with geospatial
queries. You can query using the general :func:`find()
<db.collection.find()>` function or the specialized
:dbcommand:`geoNear` command. The :dbcommand:`geoNear` command is
functionally the same as using the :func:`find()
<db.collection.find()>` function with geospatial options. The
additional benefit of :dbcommand:`geoNear` is that it provides
additional geospatial information in the return document.

Exact Matches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The index can be queried directly for an exact match on a location:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { <location field>: [ x, y ] } )

.. _geospatial-query-near:

Near
~~~~

The :operator:`$near` operator returns the 100 closest points to
``[ x, y ]`` sorted by distance.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { <location field>: { $near: [ x, y ] } } )

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find( { loc: { $near: [ -74, 40.74 ] } } )

The :dbcommand:`geoNear` is functionally equivalent to using
:func:`find() <db.collection.find()>` with :operator:`$near` but
returns additional information for each document found. To use
:dbcommand:`geoNear`, the prototype function form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( {geoNear: "collection", near: [ x, y ] } )

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( {geoNear: "places", near: [ -74, 40.74 ] } )

The default number of documents to return is 100. To further limit the
number of documents further, use the :func:`limit() <cursor.limit()>`
function with :func:`find() <db.collection.find()>` 

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { <location field>: { $near: [ x, y ] } } ).limit(n)

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find( { loc: { $near: [ -74, 40.74 ] } } ).limit(20)

or :option:`num` with :dbcommand:`geoNear`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { geoNear: "collection", near: [ x, y ], num: z } )   

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( {geoNear: "collection", near: [ -74, 40.74 ], num: 20 } )

To limit searches near a point with a particular distance you can use
:operator:`$maxDistance` with the :func:`near` function to limit the search
to a maximum distance for a particular area. :operator:`maxDistance`
is the equivalent option with :dbcommand:`geoNear`.

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.collection.find( { <location field>: { $near: [ x, y ] } , $maxDistance : z } )

  db.runCommand( { geoNear: "collection", near: [ x, y ], maxDistance: z } )

The distance specified in :operator:`maxDistance` is in the same units as the
coordinate system specifed. If the indexed location data is in meters, the
distance unit is also in meters.

Within
~~~~~~

The :operator:`$within` operator will return points within shapes such
as a circle, box, or polygon. Results from :operator:`$within` are
faster than from :operator:`$near` because they are not sorted by
distance.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find( { <location field> : { "$within" : 
                       { <shape> : <shape dimentions> } } } )

To query within a circle, specify the center of the circle and the
radius for the :option:`$circle` option.

.. code-block:: javascript

   center = [-74, 40.74]
   radius = 10

   db.places.find( { "location" : { "$within" : { "$center" : [
   center, radius ] } } } )

To query within a box, specify the lower-left and upper-right corners
of the box.

.. code-block:: javascript

   box = [ [0, 0] , [5, 5] ]

   db.places.find( { "location": { "$within": { "$box": box } } } )

To query within a polygon, specify a polygon by a multi-dimensional
array. The last point in the array is automatically connected to the
first point in the polygon.

.. code-block:: javascript

   polygon = [ [4,0], [3,2], [2,3], [2,4], [4,5], [6,4], [6,3], [5,2] ]

   db.places.find({ "location": { "$within": { "$polygon": polygon } } })

.. versionadded:: 1.9
   Support for polygon queries.


Data Representation
-------------------

Flat System
~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the flat system, you would query geospatial data using the
standard query functions. This is the default geospatial
representation in MongoDB.

Spherical System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB has a set of spherical operators to support geospatial data on
spherical systems.

To use the spherical system, ensure location data is in ``[latitude,
longitude]`` order in your documents.

.. note:: 

   The spherical functions will not read the field name (i.e. ``[
   long: x, lat: y ]`` ) and will produce undesirable results.

Radian Representation
+++++++++++++++++++++

For spherical queries, you must convert distances to radians and when
spherical queries return, you must convert from radians to distance.

- To convert distance to radians, divide distance by the radius of the
  Earth in the same units.

- To convert radians to distance, multiply radians by the radius of
  the Earth in the same units.

Radius of the Earth: 3963.192 miles or 6378.137 kilometers

Spherical Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To utilize spherical representation in queries, use the spherical
options: :operator:`$nearSphere`, :operator:`$centerSphere`, and ``{
spherical: true }`` for :dbCommand:`geoNear`

For geospatial queries with :func:`find() <db.collection.find()>` use
the equivalent spherical operators:

:operator:`$nearSphere` is equivalent to :operator:`$near`
:operator:`$centerSphere` is equivalent to :operator:`$center`

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find( { loc: { $centerSphere: [ [ -74, 40.74 ] ,
                                           100 / 6378.137 ] } } )

For :dbcommand:`geoNear`: add ``{ spherical: true }`` option:

For example, find all the points 10 miles around the point -74, 40.74:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { geoNear: "places", near: [ -74, 40.74 ],
                 maxDistance: { 100 / 3963.192 } ,
                 spherical: true }  )

.. warning:: 

   Spherical queries that wrap around the poles or at the transition
   from -180° to +180° longitude raise an error.

.. note:: 

   While the default Earth-like bounds are ``[-180,180)``, valid values
   for latitude are between ``-90° and 90°``.

Multi-location Documents
------------------------

To index documents which have multiple locations, such as an employee
address book with home and office addresses, you would need to specify
the location data in arrays of sub-objects or in a single field.

To index documents with multiple locations in an array of sub-objects,
ensure the location data is an array.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.insert( { addresses: [ { name: "home", loc: [55.5, 42.3] },
                                    { name: "work", loc: [-74, 40.74] } ] })

   db.places.ensureIndex( { "addresses.loc": "2d" } )

To index multiple locations in a single field, ensure the location
data are all in the same document.

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.insert( { userLastSeenAt: [ { x: 45.3, y: 32.2 },
                                        [ 54.2, 32.3],
                                        { lon: 44.1, lat: 38.2 } ] } )

.. versionadded:: 2.0
   Support for multiple locations in a document.

Geospatial Indexes and Sharding
-------------------------------

The shard key for a geospatial collection cannot be the location
field. However, you can shard your geospatial collection on another
key. Geospatial queries on sharded collections can be performed using
:dbcommand:`$geoNear` or :operator:`$within`.

Geospatial queries using :operator:`$near` is not supported on
geospatial data in sharded collections.
