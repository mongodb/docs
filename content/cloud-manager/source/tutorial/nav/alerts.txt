|mms| issues alerts for the conditions configured in your 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>`. When a condition triggers an 
alert, you receive the alert at regular intervals until the alert 
resolves or |mms| cancels it.

Alert Conditions
----------------

When you configure alerts, you specify alert conditions and thresholds. 
Review the possible :ref:`alert conditions <alert-conditions>` for 
which you can trigger alerts related to your clusters.

Configure Alerts
----------------

To set which conditions trigger alerts and how |mms| notifies users, 
:ref:`configure-alerts`. You can configure alerts at the organization 
or project level. |mms| provides default alerts at the project 
level. You can clone existing alerts and configure maintenance window 
alerts.

Resolve Alerts
--------------

When a condition triggers an alert, |mms| displays a warning symbol 
on the cluster and sends alert notifications. Resolve these
alerts and work to prevent alert conditions from occurring in the 
future. To learn how to fix the immediate problem, implement a 
long-term solution, and monitor your progress, see 
:ref:`alerts-resolutions`.

alert lifecycle begins:
