  The |odbc-driver-name| files are named ``libmdbodbca.so`` and
  ``libmdbodbcw.so``. After downloading the |odbc-driver-name|,
  move them to your ``/usr/local/lib`` directory.

title: Create an ``odbc.ini`` file
ref: create-odbc-ini
level: 4
content: |
  The file ``/etc/odbc.ini`` defines your Data Source Names. Below is
  an example ``odbc.ini`` file which is configured to use the
  |odbc-driver-name| with a DSN called ``MongoDBODBC``. Replace all
  necessary placeholder values with values for your system.

  The file named ``libmdbodbca.so`` is the ANSI driver, and the
  file named ``libmdbodbcw.so`` is the Unicode driver. Specify the
  desired driver by setting the ``Driver`` parameter in your
  ``odbc.ini`` file.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-ansi-unicode-driver.rst

  .. code-block:: none

     [MongoDBODBC]
     DESCRIPTION = ODBC for MongoDB BI Connector
     DRIVER      = /usr/local/lib/libmdbodbcw.so
     TRACE       = Off
     TRACEFILE   = stderr
     READONLY    = yes
     SERVER      = <server address>
     PORT        = <port number>
     USER        = <username>
     PASSWORD    = <password>
     DATABASE    = <dbname>

     ; optional SSL configuration

     SSLKEY      = </path/to/.pem-key-file>
     SSLCERT     = </path/to/ssl-certificate>
     SSLMODE     = DISABLED|PREFERRED|REQUIRED
     SSLCA       = </path/to/ssl-ca-list-file>
     SSLCAPATH   = </path/to/ssl-ca-file-directory>
     SSLCIPHER   = </path/to/ssl-cipher-file>
     RSAKEY      = </path/to/rsa-public-key-file>

  .. note::

     All ``odbc.ini`` parameters are case-insensitive.

  The previous example contains only one DSN, but it is possible to
  include multiple DSNs in an ``odbc.ini`` file.

  The following table describes the parameters used in the previous
  example.

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 30 70

     * - ``DRIVER``
       - Path to |odbc| driver file.

     * - ``TRACE``
       - ``On`` or ``Off``. Enable ODBC tracing.

     * - ``TRACEFILE``
       - If ODBC tracing is enabled, the path to the file in which to
         store the trace output.

     * - ``READONLY``
       - ``yes`` or ``no``. Enforce a read-only ODBC session.

     * - ``SERVER``
       - Address of the server where a |bi-short|
         :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` instance is running.

         the :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` instance.

     * - ``PASSWORD``
       - Password of the MongoDB user with permission to connect to
         the :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` instance.

     * - ``DATABASE``
       - Name of the MongoDB database to use.

     * - ``SSLKEY``
       - Full path to an SSL key file to use for establishing a secure
         connection. 

     * - ``SSLCERT``
       - Name of the SSL certificate file to use for establishing a
         secure connection. 

     * - ``SSLMODE``
       - Accepted values are:

         - ``DISABLED``
         - ``PREFERRED``
         - ``REQUIRED``

     * - ``SSLCA``
       - Full path to a file with a list of trust SSL Certificate
         Authorities.

  Your DSN is now ready to use. If you wish to test your DSN,
  proceed to step 3.

title: Install unixODBC
ref: install-unixodbc
level: 4
content: |
  Install ``unixODBC`` with your preferred package manager.

  On Ubuntu:

  .. code-block:: shell

     sudo apt-get install unixodbc

  On RHEL:

  .. code-block:: shell

     sudo yum install unixODBC  

  Alternatively, you can download binaries from the `unixODBC website
  <http://www.unixodbc.org>`_.

title: Test with iusql
ref: test-with-iusql
level: 4
content: |
  The ``unixODBC`` package includes an SQL client called ``iusql``. You
  can use it to test your DSN.

  The following example uses ``iusql`` to connect to the
  ``MongoDBODBC`` DSN, then looks for tables in a database named
  ``test``:

  .. code-block:: shell

     iusql -v MongoDBODBC

  .. code-block:: shell
     :copyable: false

     SQL> use test;

     SQL> show tables;
...
