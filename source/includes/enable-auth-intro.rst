|mms| enables you to configure the Authentication Mechanisms that the
|mms| Agents use to connect to your MongoDB deployments from
within the |mms| interface. You can enable multiple authentication
mechanisms for your group, but you must choose a single mechanism for the
Agents to use to authenticate to your deployment.
