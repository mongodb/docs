  .. |product| replace:: blockstore
  .. |field| replace:: Blockstore Max Capacity

  In the :guilabel:`MongoDB Connection` column, update any values that
  need to be changed in the following fields:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 30 70
     :header-rows: 1
     :stub-columns: 1

     * - Field

       - Contents

     * - <hostname>:<port>

       - Type in one or more hosts that comprise the blockstore
         database in the ``<hostname:port>`` format.

         :gold:`IMPORTANT:` If these hosts are changed, the blockstore database they
         host must have the same data as the original blockstore database. 
         Changing the host to a new blockstore databases results in data loss.

         If the blockstore database is a Replica Set or Sharded Cluster, 
         type a comma-separated list of :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>`
         instances (for a Replica Set) or :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>`
         instances (for a Sharded Cluster).

         For example: 

         .. code-block:: ini

            host1.example.com:27017,host2.example.com:27017,host2.example.com:27018

         If the blockstore database is a standalone MongoDB
         instance, type the ``hostname:port`` of the instance.

     * - MongoDB Auth Username

       - If you set this value:

         .. include:: /includes/tabsets/storage-settings-username.rst

     * - MongoDB Auth Password

       - If you set this value:

         .. include:: /includes/tabsets/storage-settings-password.rst

         |onprem| doesn't display the existing
         :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`.
         
         .. include:: /includes/warning-plaintext-password.rst

     * - Encrypted Credentials

       - Select if the Username and Password for the database were
         encrypted using the :doc:`credentialstool </tutorial/encrypt-user-credentials>`.

     * - Use TLS/SSL

       - Select if the blockstore database requires |tls| encryption.

         Beyond this checkbox, to connect this blockstore using |tls|,
         you must enable
         :manual:`TLS on the blockstore database </tutorial/configure-ssl>`.

     * - Connection Options

       - Type any additional :ref:`connection string options
         <connections-connection-options>` for the MongoDB instance.
         This field supports unescaped values only.

     * - Assignment Labels

       - Type a comma-separated list of labels to assign the
         blockstores to specific projects.

     * - Blockstore Max Capacity (GB)

       - .. include:: /includes/api/maxCapacityGB-description.rst

     * - Load Factor

       - Type any positive integer that expresses how much backup work
         you want this snapshot store to perform compared to another
         snapshot store.

         Backup work includes running backups, restoring snapshots or
         :term:`grooming <groom>` blockstores. The ratio of backup work
         assigned to a single snapshot store is called its *Load
         Factor*.         

         :gold:`IMPORTANT:` If you have only one snapshot store,
         :guilabel:`Load Factor` represents the number of concurrent 
         backup work processes the snapshot store performs at a time.
         To avoid performance costs associated with running multiple 
         concurrent processes when you have one snapshot store, 
         omit this setting to assign your snapshot store the 
         default :guilabel:`Load Factor` of ``1``. 

         When you have multiple snapshot stores, the default :guilabel:`Load Factor` 
         of ``1`` assigns each snapshot store the same amount of work. If a snapshot 
         store's :guilabel:`Load Factor` is set to ``0``, 
         it performs no backup work at all. 
         
         If a snapshot store's :guilabel:`Load Factor` is changed while 
         backup work is in progress, all jobs or tasks running on that snapshot store
         are allowed to finish. All future backup work is then re-
         distributed among the remaining snapshot stores that have a
         :guilabel:`Load Factor` of ``1`` or greater and 
         :guilabel:`Assignment Enabled` selected. 

         As a snapshot store's :guilabel:`Load Factor` increases, it
         performs more backup work compared to another snapshot store.
         For example, if the :guilabel:`Load Factor` of snapshot store ``A`` is set
         to ``2`` and the :guilabel:`Load Factor` of snapshot store
         ``B`` is set to ``1``, then ``A`` performs two times the backup
         work of ``B``.

         Snapshot stores with greater computer or storage performance
         should be given a greater :guilabel:`Load Factor`. 
         For example, consider a five-shard sharded cluster with the
         following backup storage configuration:

         - File system store (``F``) manages the backup work for
           one shard in the cluster. ``F`` is running on a single
           two-core physical server.

         - Blockstore (``B``) manages the backup work for four
           shards in the cluster. ``B`` is running as a four-node
           sharded cluster on four physical servers with two cores
           on each server.

         In this example, ``B`` has four times the capability of
         ``F``. You should set the :guilabel:`Load Factor`\s of ``B`` to ``4`` and ``F`` to ``1``. 
         For every ``1`` backup task ``F`` performs, ``B`` performs ``4``.

         For more examples comparing the storage capabilities of 
         different backup configurations, see:  

         - A file system store with 16-cores and 128 GB of RAM can
           back up more databases in less time than a file system
           store with only 2 cores and 8 GB of RAM.

         - A blockstore backed by a 10-node sharded cluster can back
           up more databases and groom more databases than a
           blockstore backed by a single replica set.

     * - Write Concern

       - Select your preferred
         :manual:`Write Concern</core/write-concern/>`:

  If you change any connection string values or the Write Concern,
  restart all the |onprem| instances including those running Backup
  Daemons.

  .. warning::

     Modifying the connection string values or the Write Concern for
     an existing blockstore requires you to restart all |onprem|
     components, including those only running the Backup Daemon to
     apply those changes. Connection parameters include:

     - :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>`
     - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Username`
     - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`
     - :guilabel:`Encrypted Credentials`
     - :guilabel:`Use TLS/SSL`
     - :guilabel:`Connection Options`
     - :guilabel:`Write Concern`

     If you change to another blockstore host, the data on the existing
     blockstore is not copied automatically to the other blockstore.
