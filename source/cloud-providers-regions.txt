Cloud Providers and Regions
===========================

   :description: Choose cloud providers and regions for your Atlas cluster to optimize network latency and cost, with options for dedicated search nodes.

The choice of cloud provider and region affects network latency for clients
accessing your {+database-deployment+} and the
:doc:`cost of running the {+database-deployment+} </billing>`. For {+clusters+},
this choice also affects the configuration options for the available {+cluster+} 
tiers. The region refers to the physical location of your MongoDB 
{+database-deployment+}.

|service| supports deploying {+Atlas-Flex+} on a subset of each cloud provider's 
regions.

For a list of supported regions, see:

- :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
- :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`
- :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure>`

In the :guilabel:`Create New Cluster` page:

- Regions marked as |star| are :guilabel:`Recommended` regions that 
  provide higher availability compared to other regions. 
- Regions marked as :icon-fa4:`money` under :guilabel:`Shared` tier  
  are not available for shared tier clusters and therefore appear 
  grayed-out. These regions are available for dedicated clusters only. 

For more information, see:

- :ref:`AWS Recommended Regions <amazon-aws-availability-zones>`
- :ref:`GCP Recommended Regions <google-gcp-availability-zones>`
- :ref:`Azure Recommended Regions <microsoft-azure-availability-zones>`

   For more information on multi-region configurations for increased
   availability, see :ref:`create-cluster-multi-region`.

Cloud Providers and Regions for Dedicated Search Nodes 
------------------------------------------------------

|service| supports deploying separate :ref:`Search Nodes 
<configure-search-nodes>` for ``M10`` and higher
{+clusters+} on |aws|, |gcp|, or |azure|. |service| supports deploying 
Search Nodes in any |gcp| region but only a subset of 
|aws| and |azure| regions.

For more information, see:

- :ref:`AWS Dedicated Search Nodes <amazon-aws-search-nodes>`
- :ref:`GCP Dedicated Search Nodes <google-gcp-search-nodes>`
- :ref:`Azure Dedicated Search Nodes <microsoft-azure-search-nodes>`
