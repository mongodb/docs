When you map organizations to your Identity Provider, |mms| grants
users who authenticate through the |idp| membership in the selected
organizations. You can give these users a default
:ref:`role <organization-roles>` in the mapped organizations.
Organization mapping lets you configure a single |idp| to grant users
access to multiple |mms| organizations.

You can apply the same |idp| to multiple organizations. You can
assign each organization a single |idp|.

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial, you must have already linked an |idp| to
|mms| and mapped one or more domains to that |idp|.
For instructions on these procedures, see:

- :ref:`mms-manage-fed-auth`
- :ref:`mms-manage-fed-domain-map`

Federation Management Access
----------------------------

Map an Organization to your Identity Provider
---------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/manage-organization-mapping.rst

Change an Organization's Mapped Identity Provider
-------------------------------------------------

Reconfigure your |idp| to change the organizations to which it's mapped.

.. include:: /includes/steps/change-org-mapped-idp.rst

*(Optional)* Configure Advanced Options for Your Organization
-------------------------------------------------------------

The following optional settings provide even greater control over user
management and authentication in your organization.

Assign a Default User Role for Your Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can assign users who authenticate through the |idp| a default
:ref:`role <organization-roles>` in a mapped organization. Configuring
this option ensures that users who authenticate through your |idp| have
the same set of permissions. This setting is not required for
organization mapping.

For instructions on assigning a default role, see
:ref:`advanced-option-default-role`.

.. note::

   The selected role only applies to users who authenticate through the
   |idp| if they do not already have a :ref:`role <organization-roles>`
   in the organization.

Restrict Access to an Organization by Domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can restrict access to your organization to an approved list of
domains. This allows you to set the domains from which organization
users can login without needing to directly map those domains to your
|idp|.

For instructions on restricting access by domain, see
:ref:`restrict-org-access-by-domain`.

Disconnect an Organization from the Federation Application
----------------------------------------------------------

When you disconnect an organization from the Federation Application,
|mms| no longer grants membership or a default
:ref:`organization role <organization-roles>` to users who authenticate
through the |idp|.

From the :guilabel:`Federation Management Console`:
