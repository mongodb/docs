.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: reIndex

   The :dbcommand:`reIndex` command rebuilds all indexes for a
   specified collection. Use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { reIndex: "collection" }

   Normally, MongoDB compacts indexes during routine updates. For most
   users, the :dbcommand:`reIndex` command is unnecessary. However, it
   may be worth running if the collection size has changed significantly
   or if the indexes are consuming a disproportionate amount of disk space.

   Note that the :dbcommand:`reIndex` command will block the server against
   writes and may take a long time for large collections.

   Call :dbcommand:`reIndex` using the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.reIndex();

   .. warning::

      This command obtains a write lock on the affected database and
      will block other operations until it has completed.
