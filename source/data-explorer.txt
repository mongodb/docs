The :guilabel:`Data Explorer` in |service| provides the ability to:

- View databases,collections and indexes in your cluster.

- Create and drop databases, collections, and indexes.

- Insert/edit/delete documents.

Data explorer reads from the primary unless the primary is unavailable.
If the primary is unavailable, data explorer reads from a non-hidden,
non-delayed secondary member.

.. _de-shard-collection-for-global-writes:

Shard a Collection for |global-write|
-------------------------------------

Administrators can shard collections residing in a 
|global-write-cluster| for 
:ref:`Global Writes <create-new-global-write-cluster>` using the 
:guilabel:`Data Explorer`. You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner` 
role for the cluster's |service| project to shard a collection for 
|global-write| in the Data Explorer.

Review the guidance and restrictions for
:ref:`global-writes-collections` before beginning this procedure.

.. important::

   After selecting a shard key via the
   Data Explorer, |service| attempts to shard the target collection. 
   During this period, ensure that no user manually
   shards the collection. If |service| detects that the target 
   collection was sharded with a different key than that selected via 
   the Data Explorer, |service| stops the procedure and 
   displays a warning for that collection in the Data Explorer. You can 
   clear the warning by clicking :guilabel:`Unmanage Collection`, 
   which removes the collection from |service| management while leaving
   the underlying collection and the manually chosen shard key intact.

   You cannot update the value of a shard key field in an existing document
   in a |global-write|-enabled collection.

To shard a collection in a |global-write-cluster|

.. include:: /includes/steps/shard-collection-for-global-writes.rst

|service| displays the compound shard key near the top of the
:guilabel:`Global Writes` tab after configuring the collection.
