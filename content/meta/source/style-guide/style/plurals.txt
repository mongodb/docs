   * - Guideline

     - Example

   * - To form the plural of an abbreviation, an acronym, or a number,
       add a lowercase *s* without an apostrophe.

       If an acronym already represents a plural noun, don't add an
       *s*.

       .. note::
          To refer to more than one FAQ document or section, add the
          appropriate noun after *FAQ* and make the noun pluralâ€”for
          example, *FAQ articles*. Follow this guideline for other
          plural acronyms when you need to refer to more than one
          instance of them.

   * - Abbreviated units of measure are both singular and plural; no
       *s* is necessary.

   * - Don't use *(s)*, */s*, *(es)*, or */es* at the end of a word to
       indicate the possibility of more than one item, and don't
       combine the singular and plural forms of a verb, such as
       *is/are*. Use the singular form or the plural form, use both
       forms joined by a conjunction, or use the phrase *one or more*.
