"MongoDB also provides :doc:`map-reduce </core/map-reduce>` operations to "

"*map* stage that processes each document and *emits* one or more objects for"
" each input document, and *reduce* phase that combines the output of the map"
" operation. Optionally, map-reduce can have a *finalize* stage to make final"
" modifications to the result. Like other aggregation operations, map-reduce "
"can specify a query condition to select the input documents as well as sort "
"and limit the results."

"MongoDB还提供了 :doc:`映射化简 </core/map-reduce>` 来做聚合。通常来说，映射化简包含了两个阶段："

"Map-reduce uses custom JavaScript functions to perform the map and reduce "

"For a number of common :doc:`single purpose aggregation operations </core"

"matching documents, returning the distinct values for a field, and grouping "
"data based on the values of a field. All of these operations aggregate "
"documents from a single collection. While these operations provide simple "
"access to common aggregation processes, they lack the flexibility and "
"capabilities of the aggregation pipeline and map-reduce."

"MongoDB提供了一些数据库命令，用于支持一组公共的 :doc:`单一用途的聚合操作 </core/single-purpose-aggregation>` 。"
"这些聚合操作包含：返回匹配到的文档个数、返回某个字段的非重复值列表、对某个字段的数据进行分组。"
"所有的这些操作都是针对单个集合中的文档进行聚合。虽然这些操作可以方便的做一些聚合，但是与聚合管道和映射化简比起来，"
"它们的灵活性和能力要差一些。"
