msgid "In a replica set, by default all :term:`secondary` members are eligible to become primary through the election process. You can use the :data:`priority <replSetGetConfig.members[n].priority>` to affect the outcome of these elections by making some members more likely to become primary and other members less likely or unable to become primary."
