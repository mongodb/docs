.. dbcommand:: logRotate

   The :dbcommand:`logRotate` command is an administrative command that
   allows you to rotate the MongoDB logs to prevent a single logfile
   from consuming too much disk space.

   If :doc:`auditing </core/auditing>` is enabled, the
   :dbcommand:`logRotate` command also rotates the audit log.

   You must issue the :dbcommand:`logRotate` command against the
   :term:`admin database` in the form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { logRotate: 1 }

   :dbcommand:`logRotate` takes an optional ``comment`` parameter which
   may be of any data type.

   .. note::

      Your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance needs to be running with the
      :option:`--logpath [file] <mongod --logpath>` option.

   You may also rotate the logs by sending a ``SIGUSR1`` signal to the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` process.

   For example, if a running :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance has a
   process ID (PID) of ``2200``, the following command rotates the log
   file for that instance on Linux:

   .. code-block:: bash

      kill -SIGUSR1 2200

Behavior
--------

The :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` setting or :option:`--logRotate <mongod --logRotate>` option
specify :dbcommand:`logRotate`'s behavior.

When :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or :option:`--logRotate <mongod --logRotate>` are set to
``rename``, :dbcommand:`logRotate` renames the existing log file by
appending the current timestamp to the filename. The appended timestamp
has the following form:

.. code-block:: none

   <YYYY>-<mm>-<DD>T<HH>-<MM>-<SS>

Then :dbcommand:`logRotate` creates a new log file with the same
name as originally specified by the :setting:`systemLog.path` setting to
:binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

When :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or :option:`--logRotate <mongod --logRotate>` are set to
``reopen``, :dbcommand:`logRotate` follows the typical Linux/Unix
behavior, and simply closes the log file, and then reopens a log file
with the same name. With ``reopen``, :binary:`~bin.mongod` expects that
another process renames the file prior to the rotation, and that the
reopen results in the creation of a new file.

.. :error:`16175` is thrown if logRotate fails
