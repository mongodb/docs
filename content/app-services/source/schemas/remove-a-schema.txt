Overview
--------

When you make :ref:`breaking changes <destructive-changes-synced-schema>` 
to your schema, you must remove the existing schema. You must do this 
after you :ref:`terminate Atlas Device Sync <terminating-realm-sync>` and before you 
:ref:`re-enable <re-enable-realm-sync>` it.

This guide shows you how to remove the schema.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Navigate to the Collection Schema Screen

      In the left navigation menu, click :guilabel:`Schema` beneath :guilabel:`Data
      Access` to open the schema editor. Atlas App Services scans your linked cluster for
      existing collections and lists them on the left side of the schema
      editor.

      By default, you see all the collections in your linked Atlas cluster.
      Any collection that has a schema shows a bolded name in this list,
      while a collection with no schema shows a light-gray, italicized name.

      From here, you can remove the schema for a single collection, or
      remove the schema for all collections.


   .. step:: Remove the Schema for a Collection

      1. Hover over the collection name, and a :guilabel:`...` menu appears.

      #. When you click this :guilabel:`...` element, you get two options. One of
         them is to :guilabel:`Delete Schema from this Collection`. Choose this
         option.

      #. A modal pops up asking you to confirm that you want to delete the schema
         for the collection. Press the :guilabel:`Delete` button.

      #. If you have already terminated Device Sync, App Services deletes the schema. If you have
         not yet :ref:`terminated Device Sync <terminating-realm-sync>`,
         a modal displays, letting you know that this is a destructive change and
         clients will experience a :ref:`Client Reset <client-resets>`. If you'd
         like to continue, press the :guilabel:`Save Changes & Reinitialize Sync`.

      At this point, the collection no longer has a schema, and
      you can choose to :ref:`generate a schema <enforce-a-schema>` or
      :ref:`enable Development Mode <development-mode>`.


   .. step:: Remove All Schemas

      If breaking changes impact multiple collections and you don't want to
      remove the schema collection-by-collection, you may remove all the schemas
      in a linked Atlas cluster.

      The first item in the :guilabel:`Collections` pane is the name of the
      linked data source. You can see a :guilabel:`...` menu next to the name.

      1. Select the :guilabel:`...` element.

      #. You can see a few options; the last of which is
         :guilabel:`Delete Schemas from All Collections`. Select this option.

      #. A modal pops up asking you to confirm that you want to delete all
         schemas for the data source. Press the :guilabel:`Delete` button.
