   :description: Learn how to create an app to connect to MongoDB deployment by using the Kotlin Sync driver.
   :keywords: quick start, tutorial, basics

Overview
--------

You can use the {+driver-short+} to connect to and communicate with
MongoDB. This guide shows you how to create an application that uses
the {+driver-short+} to connect to a MongoDB cluster hosted on
MongoDB Atlas and interact with data.

.. tip:: 

   MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your MongoDB
   deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card required) MongoDB Atlas 
   deployment by following the steps in this guide.

Follow this guide to connect a sample {+language+} application to a MongoDB Atlas
deployment. If you prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different driver or
programming language, see the :driver:`list of official MongoDB drivers <>`.

.. _kotlin-sync-download-install:

Download and Install
--------------------

This section demonstrates how to create a project and add the
{+driver-short+} dependencies by using `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__
or `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create a {+language+} project.

      First, make sure that your system has {+language+} installed and
      running on JDK 1.8 or later.

      We recommend that you use an integrated development
      environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse IDE to
      configure Gradle or Maven to build and run your project.

      .. tip::
      
         If you are not using an IDE, see the
         `Creating New Gradle Builds
         <https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/>`__ guide 
         or the `Building Maven
         <https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-building-maven.html>`__ guide
         for more information on how to set up your project.

      For more information on getting started with
      {+language+} and creating your first project, see `Get started with Kotlin/JVM
      <{+kotlin-docs+}/docs/jvm-get-started.html>`__ in the {+language+}
      language documentation.

   .. step:: Add the Driver Bill of Materials.

      .. _kotlin-sync-get-started-install-bom:

      .. sharedinclude:: dbx/jvm/bom.rst

         .. replacement:: gradle-filename

            ``build.gradle.kts``

   .. step:: Add MongoDB as a dependency.

      If you are using Gradle to manage your
      packages, add the following entry to your ``build.gradle.kts``
      dependencies list:

      .. include:: /includes/kotlin-sync-driver-gradle-versioned.rst

      If you are using Maven to manage your
      packages, add the following entry to your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:
      
      .. include:: /includes/kotlin-sync-driver-maven-versioned.rst

      Because you installed the BOM, you can omit a version in the
      {+driver-short+} dependency entry. The version you specify in the
      BOM determines the dependency versions to install.

      After you configure your dependencies, ensure that they are
      available to your project by running the dependency manager and
      refreshing the project in your IDE.
      
   .. step:: Add the serialization library dependencies.

      To enable the driver to convert between {+language+} objects and BSON, the
      data format for documents in MongoDB, you must also add one or both of the
      following serialization packages to your application:
      
      - ``bson-kotlinx`` *(Recommended)*
      - ``bson-kotlin``
      
      If you are using Gradle to manage your packages, add one of the following
      entries to your ``build.gradle.kts`` dependencies list: 
      
      .. include:: /includes/serialization-libs-gradle-versioned.rst
      
      If you are using Maven to manage your packages, add one of the following
      entries to your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:
      
      .. include:: /includes/serialization-libs-maven-versioned.rst
      
      After you configure your dependencies, ensure that they are available to your
      project by running the dependency manager and refreshing the
      project in your IDE.
      
      To learn more about these packages, see :ref:`kotlin-sync-serialization`.

After you complete these steps, you have a new project directory
and the driver dependencies installed.

.. _kotlin-sync-get-started-create-deployment:

Create a MongoDB Deployment
---------------------------

You can create a free tier MongoDB deployment on MongoDB Atlas
to store and manage your data. MongoDB Atlas hosts and manages
your MongoDB database in the cloud.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create a free MongoDB deployment in Atlas.

      Complete the MongoDB :ref:`Get Started <unified-get-started>`
      guide to set up a new Atlas account and load sample data into a new free
      tier MongoDB deployment.
      
   .. step:: Save your credentials.

      After you create your database user, save the user's 
      username and password to a safe location for use in an upcoming step.
  
After you complete these steps, you have a new free tier MongoDB
deployment on Atlas, database user credentials, and sample data loaded
in your database.

.. _kotlin-sync-get-started-connection-string:

Create a Connection String
--------------------------

You can connect to your MongoDB deployment by providing a
**connection URI**, also called a *connection string*, which
instructs the driver on how to connect to a MongoDB deployment
and how to behave while connected.

The connection string includes the hostname or IP address and 
port of your deployment, the authentication mechanism, user credentials 
when applicable, and connection options.

To connect to an instance or deployment not hosted on Atlas, see the :ref:`kotlin-sync-connection-targets` guide.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Find your MongoDB Atlas connection string.

      To retrieve your connection string for the deployment that
      you created in the :ref:`previous step <kotlin-sync-get-started-create-deployment>`,
      log into your Atlas account and navigate to the :guilabel:`Clusters` 
      page under the :guilabel:`Database` section. Click the :guilabel:`Connect` 
      button for your new deployment.

      .. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas_connect_to_cluster.png
         :alt: The connect button in the clusters section of the Atlas UI

      If you do not already have a database user configured, MongoDB will
      prompt you to create and configure a new user.

      Click the :guilabel:`Drivers` button under the
      :guilabel:`Connect to your application` section and select
      "Kotlin" from the :guilabel:`Driver` selection menu and the version
      that best matches the version you installed from the :guilabel:`Version`
      selection menu.
      
      Ensure the :guilabel:`View full code sample` option is deselected to
      view only the connection string.

   .. step:: Copy your connection string.

      Click the button on the right of the connection string to copy it to
      your clipboard as shown in the following screenshot:

      .. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas_copy_connection_string_kotlin.png
         :alt: The connection string copy button in the Atlas UI

   .. step:: Update the password placeholder.

      Paste this connection string into a file in your preferred text editor
      and replace the ``<db_password>`` placeholder with your database user's 
      password. The connection string is already populated with your database
      user's username.
      
      Save this file to a safe location for use in the next step.

After completing these steps, you have a connection string that
contains your database username and password.

.. _kotlin-sync-connect-to-mongodb:
.. _kotlin-sync-run-sample-query:

Run a Sample Query
------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create the application file.
    
      Create a file called ``DemoDataClassExample.kt`` in your project.

      Copy the following sample code into the file and replace the value of
      the ``<connection URI string>`` placeholder with your MongoDB
      Atlas connection string that you saved in the preceding step.

      .. literalinclude:: /shared/drivers-get-started/kotlin-sync/get-started-connect.kt
         :language: kotlin
         :caption: DemoDataClassExample.kt

      .. note::
      
         This example uses a {+language+} data class to model MongoDB data.

   .. step:: Run the application.

      When you run the application, it prints the details
      of a movie document that matches the query, as shown in the
      following output:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false
         
         Movie(title=Before Sunrise, year=1995, directors=[Richard Linklater])

      If you don't see any output or receive an error, check whether you
      included the proper connection string in your application. Also, confirm
      that you successfully loaded the sample dataset into your MongoDB Atlas cluster.

      After completing this step, you have a working application that uses
      the {+driver-short+} to connect to your MongoDB cluster, run a query on the
      sample data, and print out the result.

   .. step:: Use the Document class to model data (alternative).

      The preceding step demonstrates how to run a query on a sample
      collection to retrieve data by using a {+language+} data class. This section
      shows how to use the `Document <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/{+version-number+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/Document.html>`__
      class to store and retrieve data from MongoDB.

      In a file called ``DemoDocumentExample.kt``, paste the following sample
      code to run a query on your sample dataset in MongoDB Atlas. Replace the
      value of the ``<connection URI string>`` placeholder with your
      MongoDB Atlas connection string:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/DemoDocumentExample.kt
         :caption: DemoDocumentExample.kt
         :language: kotlin

      When you run the application, it prints the details
      of a movie document that matches the query, as shown in the
      following output:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false
      
         Document{{_id=..., plot=A young man and woman ..., genres=[Drama, Romance], ...}}

      If you don't see any output or receive an error, check whether you
      included the proper connection string in your application. Also, confirm
      that you successfully loaded the sample dataset into your MongoDB
      Atlas cluster.

After you complete these steps, you have a working application that
uses the driver to connect to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on
the sample data, and prints out the result.
