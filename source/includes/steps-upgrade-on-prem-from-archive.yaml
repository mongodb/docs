     You need the backed-up ``<install_dir>/conf/conf-mms.properties``

     The following commands back up the configuration files and logs to
     your home directory:

     .. class:: copyable-code
     .. code-block:: sh

        cp -a <install_dir>/conf ~/mms_conf.backup

      |mms| deployment.

    ``gen.key``
      The :ref:`encryption key <gen-key>` for the
