      Heatmaps help represent data in a tabular format and reveal
      patterns or trends within your data. Use heatmaps when the exact
      data values  are not as important as depicting higher-level trends
      and relationships.

   :doc:`/chart-type-reference/scatter-chart/`
      Scatter charts plot data with individual data points placed along
      the X and Y  axes. They are useful for representing numerical data
      and showing clearly how data points  cluster together in certain
      areas.
