Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the changes you must make to your application
when you upgrade to a new version of the {+php-library+}. This page also describes
how to upgrade your {+extension-short+} to a new version.

How to Upgrade
--------------

Before you upgrade, perform the following actions:

- Ensure the new {+library-short+} version is compatible with the {+mdb-server+} versions
  your application connects to and the PHP version your
  application compiles with. For version compatibility information, see the
  :ref:`{+php-library+} Compatibility <php-compatibility>`
  page.
- Address any breaking changes between the library version
  your application is using and your planned upgrade version in the
  :ref:`Breaking Changes <php-breaking-changes>` section.

.. tip::

   To ensure compatibility across {+mdb-server+} versions when
   upgrading library versions, use the :ref:`{+stable-api+} <php-stable-api>`.

Major and minor versions of the PHP extension and library are in sync. This
means you can run an upgrade command for the extension to also upgrade the PHP 
library. 

Patch versions (x.x.x) for the library and extension are not in sync. Run the 
respective commands to update to the patch versions for the library or extension. 

To upgrade the PHP extension, replace ``<version-number>`` with the version number 
you want to upgrade to and run the following command in your application's 
directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   pecl upgrade mongodb-<version-number>

To upgrade the PHP library version, replace ``<version-number>`` with the 
version number you want to upgrade to and run the following command in your 
application's directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   composer require mongodb/mongodb:<version-number>

Detailed installation instructions may be found in the 
:php:`PHP.net documentation <mongodb.installation>`.

Breaking Changes
----------------

A breaking change is a change of a convention or a behavior starting in
a specific version of the library. This type of change may prevent your
application from working properly if not addressed before upgrading the
library.

The breaking changes in this section are categorized by the library
version that introduced them. When upgrading library versions, address
all the breaking changes between the current and upgrade versions.

For more information on release changes, see the release notes and
associated JIRA tickets for each release on `GitHub
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library/releases>`__.

Version 2.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This library version introduces the following breaking changes:

- The following methods return ``void`` instead of the raw command
  response:

  - ``MongoDB\\Client``: ``dropDatabase()``
  - ``MongoDB\\Collection``: ``drop()``, ``dropIndex()``,
    ``dropIndexes()``, ``dropSearchIndex()``, ``rename()``
  - ``MongoDB\\Database``: ``createCollection()``, ``drop()``,
    ``dropCollection()``, ``renameCollection()``

  The ``MongoDB\\Database::createEncryptedCollection()`` method returns
  the list of encrypted fields instead of the raw command response.

  If there is an error, the methods throw an exception.

  If you must access the raw command response from the preceding
  methods, you can register a :php:`CommandSubscriber
  <mongodb-driver-monitoring-commandsubscriber>` in your application.

Version 1.20 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This library version introduces the following breaking changes:

- Drops support for {+mdb-server+} 3.6.

Version 1.19 and Earlier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For library versions 1.19 and earlier, see the release notes and associated 
JIRA tickets for each release on `GitHub <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library/releases>`__.
