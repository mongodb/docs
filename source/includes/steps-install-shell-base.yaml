   Run the following command from the directory containing the
   ``mongosh`` ``.tgz`` package:
   
   .. code-block:: sh

      tar -zxvf mongosh-{+version+}-linux.tgz

   If your web browser automatically extracts the archive as
   part of the download or you extract the archive without the
   ``tar`` command, you may need to run the following command to
   make ``mongosh`` executable:

   .. code-block:: sh

      chmod +x mongosh
