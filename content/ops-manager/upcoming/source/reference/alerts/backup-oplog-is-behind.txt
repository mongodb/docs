The |mms| backup service has not received an oplog from the 
{+mdbagent+} for at least an hour.

Alert Conditions
----------------

You can configure alert conditions in the project-level 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>` page to trigger alerts.

To learn more about the alert condition, see 
:ref:`Backup oplog is behind <backup-alert-conditions>`.

Common Triggers
---------------

- {+mdbagent+} is down.

- {+mdbagent+} is overloaded.

- {+mdbagent+} can't reach the replica set.

- {+mdbagent+} can't reach or successfully send data to |mms|.

- {+mdbagent+} is continuously restarting.

Fix the Immediate Problem
-------------------------

Check the {+mdbagent+} :doc:`logs </tutorial/view-logs>` in |mms| and 
on the {+mdbagent+} host to find out which of these occurred.

Implement a Long-Term Solution
------------------------------

Manage your :ref:`{+mdbagent+} settings <mongodb-agent-settings>`.

Monitor Your Progress
---------------------

View the {mdbagent+} status on the :guilabel:`Agents` tab to monitor 
your progress.

To learn more, see :ref:`view-agent-status`.
