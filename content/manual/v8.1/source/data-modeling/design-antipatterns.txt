Schema design anti-patterns are inefficient ways to structure your database 
schema. They can create unnecessary complexity and cause performance issues. 
Recognizing and avoiding schema design anti-patterns can help create 
applications with better performance. 

Get Started
-----------

To learn more about schema design anti-patterns, see the following pages:

   * - Schema Design Anti-Pattern
     - Definition

   * - :ref:`Avoid Unbounded Arrays <unbounded-arrays-antipattern>`
     - A document stores an unbounded array that can grow to be too large. The large 
       array can exceed the document size limit and cause a decrease in index 
       performance.

   * - :ref:`Reduce Number of Collections <reduce-collections>`
     - You create a large number of collections in your database. Having too many 
       collections can decrease storage engine performance. 

   * - :ref:`Remove Unnecessary Indexes <unnecessary-indexes-antipattern>`
     - Your collection contains unnecessary indexes. Unnecessary 
       indexes consume additional disk space and can degrade write performance.

   * - :ref:`Reduce Bloated Documents <bloated-documents-antipattern>`
     - Your collection has excessively large documents. The large documents 
       can degrade the performance of your most common queries. 

   * - :ref:`Reduce $lookup Operations <reduce-lookup-operations>`
     - You are running too many $lookup operations on your data. This increases 
       query complexity and reduces query performance.

Details
--------

The :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas Performance Advisor </performance-advisor>` (available for 
M10 clusters or higher) and :compass:`MongoDB Compass Performance Insights 
</manage-data/performance-insights>` identify schema design anti-patterns in your 
database. It is important to understand the Atlas anti-pattern warnings in order to 
properly correct the issues and prevent the use of anti-patterns.
