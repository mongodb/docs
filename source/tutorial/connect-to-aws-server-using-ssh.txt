====================================
Connect to an AWS Server through SSH
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

A server provisioned through |mms| on Amazon Web Services (AWS), by default, is
accessible through a ``mongodbdns.com`` hostname listed on the
:guilabel:`Servers` page. You can use an SSH operation that resembles the following
to connect to the server:

.. code-block:: sh

   ssh -i <ssh-key> <username>@<hostsring>.mongodbdns.com

Prerequisites
-------------

- The AWS :ref:`security group <security-group>` assigned to the AWS
  server must allow SSH access from your IP address. For more information,
  see :ref:`security-group`.

- To connect to the AWS server through SSH, you must have the public key that
  matches the shared private key you created when :doc:`provisioning the
  server </tutorial/provision-aws-servers>`.

  To provide |mms| with a public key for use when provisioning AWS servers,
  see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-aws-settings`.
