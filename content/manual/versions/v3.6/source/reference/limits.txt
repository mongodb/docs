This document provides a collection of hard and soft limitations of
the MongoDB system.

BSON Documents
--------------

.. _limit-bson-document-size:
.. limit:: BSON Document Size

   .. include:: /includes/fact-document-max-size.rst

.. _limit-nested-depth:
.. limit:: Nested Depth for BSON Documents

   MongoDB supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for :term:`BSON
   documents <document>`.

.. _restrictions-on-collection-names:
.. _faq-restrictions-on-collection-names:

Naming Restrictions
-------------------

.. limit:: Database Name Case Sensitivity

   Since database names are case *insensitive* in MongoDB, database
   names cannot differ only by the case of the characters.

.. limit:: Restrictions on Database Names for Windows

   For MongoDB deployments running on Windows, database names cannot
   contain any of the following characters:

   .. code-block:: none

      /\. "$*<>:|?

   Also database names cannot contain the null character.

.. limit:: Restrictions on Database Names for Unix and Linux Systems

   For MongoDB deployments running on Unix and Linux systems, database
   names cannot contain any of the following characters:

   .. code-block:: none

      /\. "$

   Also database names cannot contain the null character.

.. limit:: Length of Database Names

   Database names cannot be empty and must have fewer than 64 characters.

.. limit:: Restriction on Collection Names

   Collection names should begin with an underscore or a letter
   character, and *cannot*:

   - contain the ``$``.

   - be an empty string (e.g. ``""``).

   - contain the null character.

   - begin with the ``system.`` prefix. (Reserved for internal use.)

   If your collection name includes special characters, such as the
   underscore character, or begins with numbers, then to access the
   collection use the :method:`db.getCollection()` method in the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell or a :api:`similar method for your driver <>`.

.. limit:: Restrictions on Field Names

   .. include:: /includes/fact-document-field-name-restrictions.rst

.. _faq-dev-namespace:

Namespaces
----------

.. _limit-namespace-length:
.. limit:: Namespace Length

   .. include:: /includes/fact-collection-namespace-limit.rst

   .. seealso:: :ref:`faq-restrictions-on-collection-names`

.. _limit-number-of-namespaces:
.. limit:: Number of Namespaces

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

   For the MMAPv1 the number of namespaces is limited to the size of
   the namespace file divided by 628.

   A 16 megabyte namespace file can support approximately 24,000
   namespaces. Each collection and index is a namespace.

   The WiredTiger storage engine is *not* subject to this limitation.

.. _limit-size-of-namespace-file:
.. limit:: Size of Namespace File

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

   For the MMAPv1 storage engine, namespace files can be no larger
   than 2047 megabytes.

   By default namespace files are 16 megabytes. You can configure the
   size using the :setting:`~storage.mmapv1.nsSize` option.

   The WiredTiger storage engine is *not* subject to this limitation.

.. seealso:: :ref:`faq-restrictions-on-collection-names`

.. _index-limitations:

Indexes
-------

.. _limit-index-size:
.. limit:: Index Key Limit

   The *total size* of an index entry, which can include structural
   overhead depending on the BSON type, must be *less than* 1024 bytes.

   .. COMMENT refer to src/mongo/db/structure/btree/key.cpp (KeyV1Owned::KeyV1Owned)

   .. |limit| replace:: :limit:`index key limit <Index Key Limit>`

   .. versionchanged:: 2.6

      .. include:: /includes/list-index-field-limit-behaviors.rst

.. _limit-number-of-indexes-per-collection:
.. limit:: Number of Indexes per Collection

   A single collection can have *no more* than 64 indexes.

.. _limit-index-name-length:
.. limit:: Index Name Length

   Fully qualified index names, which includes the namespace and the dot
   separators (i.e. ``<database name>.<collection name>.$<index name>``),
   cannot be longer than 128 characters.

   By default, ``<index name>`` is the concatenation of the field names
   and index type. You can explicitly specify the ``<index name>`` to the
   :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` method to ensure that the fully
   qualified index name does not exceed the limit.

.. limit:: Number of Indexed Fields in a Compound Index

   There can be no more than 32 fields in a compound index.

.. limit:: Queries cannot use both text and Geospatial Indexes

   .. |operation| replace:: :query:`$text` query

   .. include:: /includes/fact-special-indexes-and-text.rst

   .. TODO remove in the 2.6 version of the manual

.. limit:: Fields with 2dsphere Indexes can only hold Geometries

   .. include:: /includes/geo-data-limit-for-2dsphere.rst

.. seealso:: The unique indexes limit in :ref:`limits-sharding-operations`.

.. limit:: NaN values returned from Covered Queries by the WiredTiger Storage Engine are always of type double

   If the value of a field returned from a query that is :ref:`covered
   by an index <covered-queries>` is ``NaN``, the type of that ``NaN``
   value is *always* ``double``.

.. limit:: Multikey Index

   .. include:: /includes/fact-multikey-index-covered-query.rst

.. limit:: Geospatial Index

   .. include:: /includes/fact-geospatial-index-covered-query.rst

.. limit:: Memory Usage in Foreground Index Builds

   .. include:: /includes/fact-index-build-default-memory-limit.rst

   .. include:: /includes/fact-index-build-memory-limit.rst

.. limit:: Collation and Index Types

   The following index types only support simple binary comparison and
   do not support :ref:`collation <collation>`:

   - :doc:`text </core/index-text>` indexes, 

   - :doc:`2d </core/2d>` indexes, and 

   - :doc:`geoHaystack </core/geohaystack>` indexes.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-index-type-restrictions-addendum.rst

Data
----

.. limit:: Maximum Number of Documents in a Capped Collection

   If you specify a maximum number of documents for a capped
   collection using the ``max`` parameter to
   :dbcommand:`create`, the limit must be less than 2\ :sup:`32`
   documents. If you do not specify a maximum number of documents when
   creating a capped collection, there is no limit on the number of
   documents.

.. _limit-database-size:
.. limit:: Database Size

   The MMAPv1 storage engine limits each database to no more than 16000 data
   files. This means that a single MMAPv1 database has a maximum size of 32TB.
   Setting the :setting:`storage.mmapv1.smallFiles` option reduces this limit to 8TB.

.. _limit-data-size:
.. limit:: Data Size

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

   Using the MMAPv1 storage engine, a single :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instance cannot manage a data set that exceeds maximum virtual
   memory address space provided by the underlying operating system.

   .. list-table:: Virtual Memory Limitations
      :widths: 15 10 10
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Operating System
        - Journaled
        - Not Journaled
      * - Linux
        - 64 terabytes
        - 128 terabytes
      * - Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1
        - 64 terabytes
        - 128 terabytes
      * - Windows (otherwise)
        - 4 terabytes
        - 8 terabytes

   The WiredTiger storage engine is *not* subject to this limitation.

.. limit:: Number of Collections in a Database

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

   For the MMAPv1 storage engine, the maximum number of collections in
   a database is a function of the size of the namespace file and the
   number of indexes of collections in the database.

   The WiredTiger storage engine is *not* subject to this limitation.

   See :limit:`Number of Namespaces` for more information.

Replica Sets
------------

.. limit:: Number of Members of a Replica Set

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

   Replica sets can have up to 50 members. See
   :ref:`3.0-replica-sets-max-members` for more information about
   specific driver compatibility with large replica sets.

.. limit:: Number of Voting Members of a Replica Set

   Replica sets can have up to 7 voting members. For replica sets with
   more than 7 total members, see :ref:`replica-set-non-voting-members`.

.. limit:: Maximum Size of Auto-Created Oplog

   .. versionchanged:: 2.6

   If you do not explicitly specify an oplog size (i.e. with
   :setting:`~replication.oplogSizeMB` or :option:`--oplogSize
   <mongod --oplogSize>`) MongoDB will create an oplog that is no
   larger than 50 gigabytes.

.. _limits-sharding:

Sharded Clusters
----------------

Sharded clusters have the restrictions and thresholds described here.

.. _limits-sharding-operations:

Sharding Operational Restrictions

.. _limits-shard-keys:

Shard Key Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. limit:: Shard Key Size

   .. include:: /includes/limits-sharding-keysize.rst

.. limit:: Shard Key Index Type

   .. include:: /includes/limits-sharding-index-type.rst

.. limit:: Shard Key is Immutable

   .. include:: /includes/limits-sharding-shardkey-document-immutable.rst

.. limit:: Monotonically Increasing Shard Keys Can Limit Insert Throughput

   .. include:: /includes/limits-sharding-shardkey-monotonic-throughput.rst

Operations
----------

.. _limit-sort:
.. limit:: Sort Operations

   If MongoDB cannot use an index to get documents in the requested
   sort order, the combined size of all documents in the sort
   operation, plus a small overhead, must be less than 32 megabytes.

.. _limit-agg-sort:

.. limit:: Aggregation Pipeline Operation

   .. include:: /includes/fact-agg-memory-limit.rst

.. limit:: 2d Geospatial queries cannot use the $or operator

   .. see:: :query:`$or` and :doc:`/core/geospatial-indexes`.

.. limit:: Geospatial Queries

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/geospatial-queries-longitude-values.rst

.. limit:: Geospatial Coordinates

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/geospatial-valid-long-lat-values.rst

.. limit:: Area of GeoJSON Polygons

   .. |geo-operator-method| replace:: :query:`$geoIntersects` or :query:`$geoWithin`

   .. include:: /includes/fact-geometry-hemisphere-limitation.rst

.. limit:: Write Command Batch Limit Size

   ``100,000`` :doc:`writes </reference/command/nav-crud>` are
   allowed in a single batch operation, defined by a single request to
   the server.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6

      The limit raises from ``1,000`` to ``100,000`` writes. This limit
      also applies to legacy ``OP_INSERT`` messages.

   The :method:`Bulk()` operations in the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and comparable methods in the drivers do not
   have this limit.

.. limit:: Views

   In addition to being read-only, views have the following operation
   restrictions:

   - .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-rename.rst

   - .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-projection-operators.rst

   - .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-text-search.rst

   - .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-mapReduce.rst

   - .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-geoNear.rst

Sessions
--------

.. limit:: Sessions and $external Username Limit 

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/sessions-external-username-limit.rst

.. limit:: Session Idle Timeout

   Sessions that receive no read or write operations for 30 minutes *or*
   that are not refreshed using :dbcommand:`refreshSessions` within this
   threshold are marked as expired and can be closed by the MongoDB
   server at any time. Closing a session kills any in-progress
   operations and open cursors associated with the session. This
   includes cursors configured with :method:`~cursor.noCursorTimeout` or
   a :method:`~cursor.maxTimeMS` greater than 30 minutes.

   Consider an application that issues a :method:`db.collection.find()`.
   The server returns a cursor along with a batch of documents defined
   by the :method:`cursor.batchSize()` of the
   :method:`~db.collection.find()`. The session refreshes each time the
   application requests a new batch of documents from the server.
   However, if the application takes longer than 30 minutes to process
   the current batch of documents, the session is marked as expired and
   closed. When the application requests the next batch of documents,
   the server returns an error as the cursor was killed when the session
   was closed.

   For operations that return a cursor, if the cursor may be idle for
   longer than 30 minutes, issue the operation within an explicit
   session using :method:`Session.startSession()` and periodically
   refresh the session using the :dbcommand:`refreshSessions` command.
   For example:

   .. code-block:: shell

     var session = db.getMongo().startSession()
     var sessionId = session.getSessionId().id

     var cursor = session.getDatabase("examples").getCollection("data").find().noCursorTimeout()
     var refreshTimestamp = new Date() // take note of time at operation start
    
     while (cursor.hasNext()) {
      
       // Check if more than 5 minutes have passed since the last refresh
       if ( (new Date()-refreshTimestamp)/1000 > 300 ) { 
         print("refreshing session")
         db.adminCommand({"refreshSessions" : [sessionId]})
         refreshTimestamp = new Date()
       }

       // process cursor normally
      
     }

   In the example operation, the :method:`db.collection.find()` method
   is associated with an explicit session. The cursor is configured with
   :method:`~cursor.noCursorTimeout()` to prevent the server from
   closing the cursor if idle. The ``while`` loop includes a block that
   uses :dbcommand:`refreshSessions` to refresh the session every 5
   minutes. Since the session will never exceed the 30 minute idle
   timeout, the cursor can remain open indefinitely.

   For MongoDB drivers, defer to the :ecosystem:`driver documentation
   </drivers>` for instructions and syntax for creating sessions.
