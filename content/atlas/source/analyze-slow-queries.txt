|service| provides several tools to help analyze slow queries
executed on your clusters. See the following sections for descriptions 
of each tool. To optimize your query performance, 
:ref:`review the best practices for query performance 
<query-best-practices>`.

Performance Advisor
-------------------

The :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` monitors queries 
that MongoDB considers slow and suggests new indexes to improve query 
performance.

You can use the Performance Advisor to review the following information:

- :ref:`Index Ranking <pa-index-ranking>`
- :ref:`Drop Index Recommendations <pa-drop-index>`

.. tip::

   You can also access Performance Advisor recommendations from AI clients 
   by using the :ref:`MongoDB MCP Server <what-is-mcp-server>`. This tool
   enables you to interact with your Atlas clusters through natural language. 
   To learn more, see :ref:`performance-advisor-mcp`.

Query Insights
--------------

If available, the :ref:`Project Overview <project-overview>` page 
includes a :guilabel:`View Query Insights` section with alerts and 
high-level metrics for slow queries and sampled P95 latency. This 
section also includes a shortcut to the :guilabel:`Query Insights` tab.

The following tools are found in the :guilabel:`Query Insights` tab: 

Query Shape Insights 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Query Shape Insights <query-shape-insights>` displays performance statistics for query shapes with slow-running queries.
You can select up to five query shapes to view their metrics in charts, and filter by host, shard, and time range to monitor the most relevant performance metrics and statistics 
for your project.

Namespace Insights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Namespace Insights <namespace-insights>` displays query latency statistics for collections with slow-running queries.
You can pin up to five namespaces to view their metrics in charts, and filter by host, shard, time range, and operation type to monitor the most relevant latency metrics and statistics
for your project. 

Query Profiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`Query Profiler <query-profiler>` displays slow-running 
operations and their key performance statistics. You can explore a 
sample of historical queries for up to the last seven days without 
additional cost or performance overhead. Before you enable the Query 
Profiler, see :ref:`Considerations 
<atlas-considerations-profile-database>`.

Real-Time Performance Panel (RTPP)
----------------------------------
The :ref:`Real-Time Performance Panel <real-time-metrics-status-tab>`  
identifies relevant database operations, evaluates query execution 
times, and shows the ratio of documents scanned to documents returned 
during query execution. |rtpp| is enabled by default.

.. _query-best-practices:

Best Practices for Query Performance
------------------------------------

To optimize query performance, review the following best practices:

- Create queries that your current indexes support to reduce the time 
  needed to search for your results.
  
- Avoid creating documents with large array fields that require a lot 
  of processing to search and index.

- Optimize your indexes and remove unused or inefficient indexes. Too 
  many indexes can negatively impact write performance.

- Consider the suggested indexes from the :ref:`Performance Advisor 
  <performance-advisor>` with the highest :guilabel:`Impact` scores and 
  lowest :guilabel:`Average Query Targeting` scores.

- Create the indexes that the Performance Advisor suggests when they 
  align with your :manual:`Indexing Strategies 
  </applications/indexes/>`.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-performance-advisor-timestamp.rst 

- Perform :manual:`rolling index builds
  </tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets/#rolling-index-builds-on-replica-sets>`
  to reduce the performance impact of building indexes on 
  :term:`replica sets <replica set>` and :term:`sharded clusters 
  <sharded cluster>`.

- :ref:`Drop unused, redundant, and hidden indexes <pa-drop-index>` to 
  improve write performance and free storage space.
