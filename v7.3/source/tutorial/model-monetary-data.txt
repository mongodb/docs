Overview
--------

Applications that handle monetary data often require the ability to
capture fractional units of currency and need to emulate decimal
rounding with exact precision when performing arithmetic.
The binary-based floating-point arithmetic used by many modern systems
(i.e., float, double) is unable to represent exact decimal fractions
and requires some degree of approximation making it unsuitable for
monetary arithmetic. This constraint is an important consideration when
modeling monetary data.

There are several approaches to modeling monetary data in MongoDB using
the numeric and non-numeric models.

.. _numeric-model-use-case:

Numeric Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The numeric model may be appropriate if you need to query the
database for exact, mathematically valid matches or need to perform
server-side arithmetic, e.g., :update:`$inc`, :update:`$mul`, and
:ref:`aggregation pipeline arithmetic <agg-quick-ref-operator-arithmetic>`.
  
**The following approaches follow the numeric model:**

- :ref:`numeric-decimal` which is a decimal-based
  floating-point format capable of providing exact precision. 
  
- :ref:`numeric-scale-factor` to convert the monetary value
  to a 64-bit integer (``long`` BSON type) by multiplying by a power of
  10 scale factor.

.. _non-numeric-model-use-case:

Non-Numeric Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is no need to perform server-side arithmetic on monetary data
or if server-side approximations are sufficient, modeling monetary data
using the non-numeric model may be suitable.

**The following approach follows the non-numeric model:**

- :ref:`Using two fields for the monetary value <monetary-value-non-numeric>`:
  One field stores the exact monetary value as a
  non-numeric ``string`` and another field stores a binary-based
  floating-point (``double`` BSON type) approximation of the value.

.. note::

   Arithmetic mentioned on this page refers to server-side
   arithmetic performed by :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`, and
   not to client-side arithmetic.

.. _monetary-value-numeric:

Numeric Model
-------------

.. _numeric-decimal:

Using the Decimal BSON Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``decimal128`` :ref:`BSON type <bson-types>` uses the IEEE 754
``decimal128`` decimal-based floating-point numbering format. Unlike
binary-based floating-point formats such as the ``double`` BSON type,
``decimal128`` does not approximate decimal values and is able to
provide the exact precision required for working with monetary data.

In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, ``decimal`` values are assigned and queried
using the ``Decimal128()`` constructor.  The following example adds a
document containing gas prices to a ``gasprices`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.gasprices.insertOne(
      {
         "date" : ISODate(), 
         "price" : Decimal128("2.099"), 
         "station" : "Quikstop", 
         "grade" : "regular" 
      }
   )

The following query matches the document above:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.gasprices.find( { price: Decimal128("2.099") } )
   
For more information on the ``decimal`` type, see
:ref:`shell-type-decimal`.

Converting Values to Decimal
````````````````````````````

A collection's values can be transformed to the ``decimal`` type by
performing a one-time transformation or by modifying application logic
to perform the transformation as it accesses records.

.. tip::

   Alternative to the procedure outlined below, starting in version
   4.0, you can use the :expression:`$convert` and its helper
   :expression:`$toDecimal` operator to convert values to ``Decimal128()``.

One-Time Collection Transformation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A collection can be transformed by iterating over all documents in the
collection, converting the monetary value to the ``decimal`` type, and
writing the document back to the collection. 

.. note:: It is strongly advised to add the ``decimal`` value to the
   document as a new field and remove the old field later once the
   new field's values have been verified. 

.. warning:: Be sure to  test ``decimal`` conversions in an
   isolated test environment. Once datafiles are created or modified
   they will no longer be compatible with previous versions and there is no 
   support for downgrading datafiles containing decimals.

**Scale Factor Transformation:**
   
Consider the following collection which used the
:ref:`Scale Factor <numeric-scale-factor>` approach and saved
the monetary value as a 64-bit integer representing the number of cents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "description" : "T-Shirt", "size" : "M", "price" : NumberLong("1999") },
   { "_id" : 2, "description" : "Jeans", "size" : "36", "price" : NumberLong("3999") },
   { "_id" : 3, "description" : "Shorts", "size" : "32", "price" : NumberLong("2999") },
   { "_id" : 4, "description" : "Cool T-Shirt", "size" : "L", "price" : NumberLong("2495") },
   { "_id" : 5, "description" : "Designer Jeans", "size" : "30", "price" : NumberLong("8000") }

The ``long`` value can be converted to an appropriately formatted
``decimal`` value by multiplying ``price`` and
``NumberDecimal("0.01")`` using the :expression:`$multiply` operator.
The following aggregation pipeline assigns the converted value to the
new ``priceDec`` field in the :pipeline:`$addFields` stage:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.clothes.aggregate(
     [
       { $match: { price: { $type: "long" }, priceDec: { $exists: 0 } } }, 
       {
         $addFields: {
           priceDec: {
             $multiply: [ "$price", NumberDecimal( "0.01" ) ]
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   ).forEach( ( function( doc ) {
     db.clothes.replaceOne( doc );
   } ) )
   
The results of the aggregation pipeline can be verified using the
``db.clothes.find()`` query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "description" : "T-Shirt", "size" : "M", "price" : NumberLong(1999), "priceDec" : NumberDecimal("19.99") }
   { "_id" : 2, "description" : "Jeans", "size" : "36", "price" : NumberLong(3999), "priceDec" : NumberDecimal("39.99") }
   { "_id" : 3, "description" : "Shorts", "size" : "32", "price" : NumberLong(2999), "priceDec" : NumberDecimal("29.99") }
   { "_id" : 4, "description" : "Cool T-Shirt", "size" : "L", "price" : NumberLong(2495), "priceDec" : NumberDecimal("24.95") }
   { "_id" : 5, "description" : "Designer Jeans", "size" : "30", "price" : NumberLong(8000), "priceDec" : NumberDecimal("80.00") }

If you do not want to add a new field with the ``decimal`` value, the
original field can be overwritten. The following
:method:`~db.collection.updateMany()` method first checks that ``price``
exists and that it is a ``long``, then transforms the ``long`` value to
``decimal`` and stores it in the ``price`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.clothes.updateMany( 
     { price: { $type: "long" } },
     { $mul: { price: NumberDecimal( "0.01" ) } }
   )

The results can be verified using the ``db.clothes.find()`` query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "description" : "T-Shirt", "size" : "M", "price" : NumberDecimal("19.99") }
   { "_id" : 2, "description" : "Jeans", "size" : "36", "price" : NumberDecimal("39.99") }
   { "_id" : 3, "description" : "Shorts", "size" : "32", "price" : NumberDecimal("29.99") }
   { "_id" : 4, "description" : "Cool T-Shirt", "size" : "L", "price" : NumberDecimal("24.95") }
   { "_id" : 5, "description" : "Designer Jeans", "size" : "30", "price" : NumberDecimal("80.00") }

**Non-Numeric Transformation:**
  
Consider the following collection which used the
:ref:`non-numeric <monetary-value-non-numeric>`
model and saved the monetary value as a ``string`` with the exact
representation of the value:  

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   { "_id" : 1, "description" : "T-Shirt", "size" : "M", "price" : "19.99" }
   { "_id" : 2, "description" : "Jeans", "size" : "36", "price" : "39.99" }
   { "_id" : 3, "description" : "Shorts", "size" : "32", "price" : "29.99" }
   { "_id" : 4, "description" : "Cool T-Shirt", "size" : "L", "price" : "24.95" }
   { "_id" : 5, "description" : "Designer Jeans", "size" : "30", "price" : "80.00" }
  
The following function first checks that ``price`` exists and that it
is a ``string``, then transforms the ``string`` value to a ``decimal``
value and stores it in the ``priceDec`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.clothes.find( { $and : [ { price: { $exists: true } }, { price: { $type: "string" } } ] } ).forEach( function( doc ) {
     doc.priceDec = NumberDecimal( doc.price );
     db.clothes.replaceOne( doc );
   } );
   
The function does not output anything to the command line. The results
can be verified using the ``db.clothes.find()`` query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "description" : "T-Shirt", "size" : "M", "price" : "19.99", "priceDec" : NumberDecimal("19.99") }
   { "_id" : 2, "description" : "Jeans", "size" : "36", "price" : "39.99", "priceDec" : NumberDecimal("39.99") }
   { "_id" : 3, "description" : "Shorts", "size" : "32", "price" : "29.99", "priceDec" : NumberDecimal("29.99") }
   { "_id" : 4, "description" : "Cool T-Shirt", "size" : "L", "price" : "24.95", "priceDec" : NumberDecimal("24.95") }
   { "_id" : 5, "description" : "Designer Jeans", "size" : "30", "price" : "80.00", "priceDec" : NumberDecimal("80.00") }
   
Application Logic Transformation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to perform the transformation to the ``decimal``
type from within the application logic. In this scenario the
application modified to perform the transformation as it accesses
records.

The typical application logic is as follows: 

- Test that the new field exists and that it is of ``decimal`` type

- If the new ``decimal`` field does not exist:
  
  - Create it by properly converting old field values
  
  - Remove the old field 
  
  - Persist the transformed record  

.. _numeric-scale-factor:

Using a Scale Factor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::  
   
   Using the :ref:`decimal <numeric-decimal>` type for modeling
   monetary data is preferred over the :ref:`Scale Factor 
   <numeric-scale-factor>` method.

To model monetary data using the scale factor approach:

1. Determine the maximum precision needed for the monetary value. For
   example, your application may require precision down to the tenth of
   one cent for monetary values in ``USD`` currency.

#. Convert the monetary value into an integer by multiplying the value
   by a power of 10 that ensures the maximum precision needed becomes the
   least significant digit of the integer. For example, if the required
   maximum precision is the tenth of one cent, multiply the monetary value
   by 1000.

#. Store the converted monetary value.

For example, the following scales ``9.99 USD`` by 1000 to preserve
precision up to one tenth of a cent.

.. code-block:: bash

   { price: 9990, currency: "USD" }

The model assumes that for a given currency value:

- The scale factor is consistent for a currency; i.e. same scaling
  factor for a given currency.

- The scale factor is a constant and known property of the currency;
  i.e applications can determine the scale factor from the currency.

When using this model, applications must be consistent in performing
the appropriate scaling of the values.

For use cases of this model, see :ref:`numeric-model-use-case`.

.. _monetary-value-non-numeric:

Non-Numeric Model
-----------------
   
To model monetary data using the non-numeric model, store the
value in two fields:

1. In one field, encode the exact monetary value as a non-numeric data
   type; e.g., ``BinData`` or a ``string``.

#. In the second field, store a double-precision floating point
   approximation of the exact value.

The following example uses the non-numeric model to store
``9.99 USD`` for the price and ``0.25 USD`` for the fee:

.. code-block:: bash

   {
     price: { display: "9.99", approx: 9.9900000000000002, currency: "USD" },
     fee: { display: "0.25", approx: 0.2499999999999999, currency: "USD" }
   }

With some care, applications can perform range and sort queries on the
field with the numeric approximation. However, the use of the approximation
field for the query and sort operations requires that applications
perform client-side post-processing to decode the non-numeric
representation of the exact value and then filter out the returned
documents based on the exact monetary value.

For use cases of this model, see
:ref:`non-numeric-model-use-case`.
