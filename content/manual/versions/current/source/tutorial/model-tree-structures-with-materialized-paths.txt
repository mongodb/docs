Overview
--------

This page describes a data model that describes a tree-like
structure in MongoDB documents by storing full relationship paths
between documents.

Pattern
-------

.. start-model-tree-structures-include-here

The *Materialized Paths* pattern stores each tree node in a document;
in addition to the tree node, document stores as a string the id(s) of
the node's ancestors or path. Although the *Materialized Paths* pattern
requires additional steps of working with strings and regular
expressions, the pattern also provides more flexibility in working with
the path, such as finding nodes by partial paths.


Consider the following hierarchy of categories:

.. include:: /images/data-model-tree.rst

The following example models the tree using *Materialized Paths*,
storing the path in the field ``path``; the path string uses the comma
``,`` as a delimiter:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.categories.insertMany( [
      { _id: "Books", path: null },
      { _id: "Programming", path: ",Books," },
      { _id: "Databases", path: ",Books,Programming," },
      { _id: "Languages", path: ",Books,Programming," },
      { _id: "MongoDB", path: ",Books,Programming,Databases," },
      { _id: "dbm", path: ",Books,Programming,Databases," }
   ] )

- You can query to retrieve the whole tree, sorting by the field
  ``path``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.categories.find().sort( { path: 1 } )

- You can use regular expressions on the ``path`` field to find the
  descendants of ``Programming``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.categories.find( { path: /,Programming,/ } )

- You can also retrieve the descendants of ``Books`` where the
  ``Books`` is also at the topmost level of the hierarchy:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.categories.find( { path: /^,Books,/ } )

- To create an index on the field ``path`` use the following
  invocation:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.categories.createIndex( { path: 1 } )

  This index may improve performance depending on the query:

  - For queries from the root ``Books`` sub-tree (e.g. ``/^,Books,/``
    or ``/^,Books,Programming,/``), an index on the ``path`` field
    improves the query performance significantly.

  - For queries of sub-trees where the path from the root is not
    provided in the query (e.g. ``/,Databases,/``), or similar queries
    of sub-trees, where the node might be in the middle of the indexed
    string, the query must inspect the entire index.

    For these queries an index *may* provide some performance
    improvement *if* the index is significantly smaller than the
    entire collection.
