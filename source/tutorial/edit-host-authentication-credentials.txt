Overview
--------

Your MongoDB deployments can use the access control mechanisms described
here. You specify the authentication settings when :doc:`adding the
deployment </tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes>`. You can also edit
the security settings after adding a deployment, as described on this page.

If a deployment uses access control, the Monitoring and Backup Agents
must authenticate to the deployment as MongoDB users with appropriate
access. If you are using Automation to manage your MongoDB deployments,
you will enable and configure authentication through the |mms| interface.

If you are not using Automation to manage your MongoDB deployments,
you must configure the Monitoring and Backup agents manually.

Considerations
--------------

With access control enabled, you must :doc:`create MongoDB users
</tutorial/manage-mongodb-users>` so that clients can access your
databases.

If you are using Automation to manage your MongoDB deployments, |mms|
automatically creates users for the agents when you enable access
control. The user created for the Automation Agent has privileges to
administrate and manage other users. As such, the first user you create
can have any role.

When you select an Authentication Mechanism for your |mms| group, this
enables access control for all the deployments in your |mms| group.

.. admonition:: Recommendation

   To avoid inconsistencies, use the |mms| interface to manage users
   and roles for MongoDB deployments.

For more information on MongoDB access control, see the
:manual:`Authentication </core/authentication>` and
:manual:`Authorization </core/authorization>` pages in the MongoDB
manual.

Access Control Mechanisms
-------------------------

.. _mongodb-cr:

``MONGODB-CR``/``SCRAM-SHA-1``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In MongoDB 3.0 and later, MongoDB's default authentication mechanism is
a challenge and response mechanism (``SCRAM-SHA-1``). ``SCRAM-SHA-1``
is an IETF standard, `RFC 5802 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`_,
that defines best practice methods for implementation of
challenge-response mechanisms for authenticating users with passwords.

Previously, MongoDB used MongoDB Challenge and Response
(``MONGODB-CR``) as the default. ``MONGODB-CR`` is a challenge-response
mechanism that authenticates users through passwords.

To enable ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` or ``MONGODB-CR`` when using Automation, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/enable-mongodbcr-authentication-for-group`.

To configure the agents to authenticate as users with the proper access
**without** Automation, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-cr`

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-cr`

LDAP
~~~~

`MongoDB Enterprise
<http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise?jmp=docs>`_ provides
support for proxy authentication of users. This allows administrators to
configure a MongoDB cluster to authenticate users by proxying
authentication requests to a specified Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) service.

To enable LDAP for your |mms| project when using Automation, see:
:doc:`/tutorial/enable-ldap-authentication-for-group`.

To configure the agents to authenticate as users with the proper access
**without** Automation, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-ldap`

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-ldap`

Kerberos
~~~~~~~~

`MongoDB Enterprise <http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise?jmp=docs>`_
supports authentication using a Kerberos service. Kerberos is an industry
standard authentication protocol for large client/server systems.

To use MongoDB with Kerberos, you must have a properly configured
Kerberos deployment, configure *Kerberos service principals* for
MongoDB, and add the *Kerberos user principal*. 

If you are using Automation, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/enable-kerberos-authentication-for-group`

To create a Kerberos Principal and the associated MongoDB user, and to
configure the Monitoring and Backup Agents to authenticate as users with
the proper access **without** Automation, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-kerberos`

- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-kerberos`

Specify Kerberos as the MongoDB process's authentication mechanism when
:doc:`adding the deployment </tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes>` or when
:ref:`editing the deployment <edit-host-credentials>`.

x.509
~~~~~

MongoDB supports x.509 certificate authentication for use with a secure
:doc:`TLS/SSL connection </tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment>`. 
The x.509 client authentication allows clients to
authenticate to servers with certificates rather than with a username
and password.

To enable x.509 authentication for your |mms| project when using Automation, see:
:doc:`/tutorial/enable-x509-authentication-for-group`.

.. TODO: add links to the manual tutorial once it's written

.. note:: 

   |mms| does **not** currently support :manual:`using x.509
   certificates for membership authentication
   </tutorial/configure-x509-member-authentication/>`.

.. _edit-host-credentials:

Edit Host Credentials
---------------------

If your deployment is managed by |mms|, you will configure the
deployment to use the authentication mechanism from the |mms| interface.
The :doc:`/tutorial/nav/access-control-mongodb` tutorials describe
how to configure an existing deployment to use each authentication
mechanism.

If your deployment is **not** managed by |mms|, manually configure the
Monitoring and Backup agents with the proper credentials **before** you
edit the host's authentication credentials.

.. see:: 
   :doc:`/tutorial/nav/configure-monitoring-agent` and
   :doc:`/tutorial/nav/configure-backup-agent` describe how to
   configure the Monitoring and Backup agents for access control.

Once the Monitoring and Backup agents are correctly configured, you can
edit the deployment's authentication credentials using the following
procedures.

Edit Credentials for Monitoring a Host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: 
   Before editing these credentials, configure the Monitoring Agent with
   the proper credentials. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/nav/configure-monitoring-agent`.

To edit the credential for Monitoring:

.. include:: /includes/steps/monitoring-agent-edit-host-credentials.rst

Edit Credentials for Backing up a Host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: 
   Before editing these credentials, configure the Backup Agent with the
   proper credentials. See :doc:`/tutorial/nav/configure-backup-agent`.

To edit the credential for Backup:

.. include:: /includes/steps/backup-agent-edit-host-credentials.rst
