      Configure the following setting to provide the connection string
      |onprem| uses to connect to the database:

      - :setting:`mongo.mongoUri`
  - pre: |

      If you will configure |onprem| to use the |application| Database over
      SSL, configure the following :ref:`SSL settings <mongodb-ssl-settings>`.

      - :setting:`mongo.ssl`
      - :setting:`mongodb.ssl.CAFile`
      - :setting:`mongodb.ssl.PEMKeyFile`
      - :setting:`mongodb.ssl.PEMKeyFilePassword`

      |onprem| also uses these settings for SSL connections to Backup Databases

  - pre: |

      If you will configure |onprem| to use Kerberos to manage access to the
      |application| Database, configure the following
      :ref:`Kerberos settings <configuration-kerberos-settings>`:

      - :setting:`jvm.java.security.krb5.conf`
      - :setting:`jvm.java.security.krb5.kdc`

  a. Enter the following URL in a browser, where ``<host>`` is the fully
     qualified domain name of the server:

     .. class:: copyable-code
     .. code-block:: sh

        http://<OpsManagerHost>:8080

  b. Click the :guilabel:`Register` link and follow the prompts to register
     the first user and create the first project. The first user is
     automatically assigned the :ref:`Global Owner <global-owner-role>` role.

  |onprem| walks you through several configuration pages. Required
  settings are marked with an asterisk. Enter information as appropriate.
  When configuration is complete, |onprem| opens the
  :guilabel:`Deployment` page.

  In addition to the common required settings, the following are required
  for particular deployment configurations. For more information on a
  setting, see :doc:`/reference/configuration`.

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 35 65
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Configuration

       - Required Settings

     * - If are running multiple |onprem| instances behind a load balancer

       - Set :guilabel:`Load Balancer Remote IP Header` to the name of the
         header the load balancer will use when forwarding the client's IP
         address to the application server. If you set this, do not allow
         clients to connect directly to any of the application servers.
         The load balancer must not return cached content.
         You will set up the additional servers as part of the next steps
         in this procedure.

     * - If you are using Automation or Backup without an internet
         connection

       - Set the *MongoDB Version Management* settings. You will need to
         put the tarballs for every MongoDB release used in your
         deployment in the configured release directory on every |onprem|
         server. For more information, see
         :doc:`/tutorial/configure-local-mode`.

pre: |
  .. include:: /includes/fact-genkey-file-requirement.rst

  You must copy the ``gen.key`` file from the current server, on which you
  just installed |onprem|, to every server that will run |onprem|. You
  must copy the ``gen.key`` to the other servers **before** starting
  |onprem| on them.

  For each |onprem| instance, repeat the step to configure the connection to
  the |application| Database and the step to start the application.

  For more information on running multiple applications behind a load
  balancer, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-application-high-availability`.

title: "If you will run |onprem| Backup, configure the Backup Daemon and Backup Storage."
stepnum: 0
level: 4
ref: configure-backup-database-uri
content: |

  a. On each |onprem| server that you activate as a Backup Daemon, create
     the directory in which to store the :term:`head databases <head
     database>`. The directory must be:

     - dedicated for this purpose on a local disk partition.

     - sized appropriately according to the :doc:`/core/requirements`.

     - writable by the ``mongodb-mms`` user.

  b. Configure the :doc:`Backup Storage </tutorial/nav/backup-storage>` you
     want to use for your snapshots.

  c. Open |onprem| and verify that you are logged in as the user you
     registered when installing |onprem|. This user is the
     :ref:`global owner <global-owner-role>`.

  d. Click the :guilabel:`Admin` link at the top right of the page.

  e. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

  f. Follow the prompts to configure the Backup Daemon and Backup Storage.
     |onprem| walks you through configuration of the daemon and snapshot
     storage.

     After you select how to store snapshots, you are prompted to
     configure the connection string to the Backup Database. If you use
     filesystem storage for your snapshots, the Backup Database is used
     only for the :term:`oplog store <Oplog Store Database>`.

     .. warning::

        Once the connection string is saved, any change to the string
        requires you to restart all the |onprem| instances, including
        those running activated Backup Daemons. Making the change and
        clicking :guilabel:`Save` is not sufficient. |onprem| will
        continue to use the previous string until you restart the
        instances.

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 35 65

        * - :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>`

          - Enter a comma-separated list of the fully qualified domain
            names and port numbers for all :term:`replica set` members for
            the Backup Database.

        * - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Username` and

            :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`

          - Enter the user credentials if the database uses
            authentication.

        * - :guilabel:`Encrypted Credentials`

          - Check this if the user credentials use the |onprem|
            ``credentialstool``. For more information, see
            :ref:`encrypt-mongodb-user-credentials`.

        * - :guilabel:`Use SSL`

          - Check this if the database uses SSL. If you select this, you
            must configure SSL settings |onprem|. See
            :doc:`/reference/configuration`.

        * - :guilabel:`Connection Options`

          - To add additional connection options, enter them using the MongoDB
            :manual:`Connection String URI Format </reference/connection-string>`.
            This field supports un-escaped values only.
