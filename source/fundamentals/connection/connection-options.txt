     - integer
     - Specifies the minimum number of connections that must exist at
       any moment in a single connection pool.

       | **Default**: ``0``

   * - **maxPoolSize**
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum number of connections that a connection
       pool may have at a given time.

       | **Default**: ``100``

   * - **waitQueueTimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds that a
       thread may wait for a connection to become available.

       | **Default**: ``120000`` (120 seconds)

       | **Default**: ``30000`` (30 seconds)

   * - **localThresholdMS**
     - integer
     - When communicating with multiple instances of MongoDB in a replica
       set, the driver will only send requests to a server whose
       response time is less than or equal to the server with the fastest
       response time plus the local threshold, in milliseconds.

       | **Default**: ``15``

   * - **heartbeatFrequencyMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies the frequency, in milliseconds that the driver will
       wait between attempts to determine the current state of each
       server in the cluster.

       | **Default**: ``10000`` (10 seconds)

   * - **replicaSet**
     - string
     - Specifies that the :ref:`connection string <connection-uri>`
       provided includes multiple hosts. When specified, the driver
       attempts to find all members of that set.

       | **Default**: ``null``

   * - **ssl**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that all communication with MongoDB instances should
       use TLS/SSL. Superseded by the **tls** option.

       | **Default**: ``false``

     - boolean
     - Specifies that all communication with MongoDB instances should
       use TLS. Supersedes the **ssl** option.

       | **Default**: ``false``

   * - **tlsInsecure**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that the driver should allow invalid hostnames for TLS
       connections. Has the same effect as setting
       **tlsAllowInvalidHostnames** to ``true``. To configure TLS security
       constraints in other ways, use a
       :ref:`custom SSLContext <tls-custom-sslContext>`.

       | **Default**: ``false``

   * - **tlsAllowInvalidHostnames**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that the driver should allow invalid hostnames in the

       to open.

       | **Default**: ``10000`` (10 seconds)

   * - **socketTimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the Kotlin
       driver will wait to send or receive a request before timing out.
       A value of ``0`` instructs the driver to never time out while waiting
       to send or receive a request.

       | **Default**: ``0``

   * - **maxIdleTimeMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the Kotlin
       driver will allow a pooled connection to idle before closing the
       connection. A value of ``0`` indicates that there is no upper bound
       on how long the driver can allow a pooled collection to be idle.

       | **Default**: ``0``

   * - **maxLifeTimeMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the Kotlin
       driver will continue to use a pooled connection before closing the
       connection. A value of ``0`` indicates that there is no upper bound
       on how long the driver can keep a pooled connection open.

       | **Default**: ``0``

   * - **journal**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that the driver must wait for the connected MongoDB
       instance to group commit to the journal file on disk for all writes.

       | **Default**: ``false``

   * - **w**
     - string or integer
     - Specifies the write concern. For more information on values, see

       A value of ``0`` instructs the driver to never time out write operations.

       | **Default**: ``0``

   * - **readPreference**
     - string
     - Specifies the read preference. For more information on values, see
       the server documentation for the
       :manual:`readPreference option </reference/connection-string/#urioption.readPreference>`.

       | **Default**: ``primary``

   * - **readPreferenceTags**
     - string
     - Specifies the read preference tags. For more information on values, see
       the server documentation for the
       :manual:`readPreferenceTags option </reference/connection-string/#urioption.readPreferenceTags>`.

       | **Default**: ``null``

   * - **maxStalenessSeconds**
     - integer
     - Specifies, in seconds, how stale a secondary can be before the
       driver stops communicating with that secondary. The minimum value is
       either 90 seconds or the heartbeat frequency plus 10 seconds, whichever
       is greater. For more information, see the server documentation for the
       :manual:`maxStalenessSeconds option </reference/connection-string/#urioption.maxStalenessSeconds>`.

     - Specifies the :doc:`authentication mechanism </fundamentals/auth>`
       that the driver should use if a credential
       was supplied.

       | **Default**: By default, the client picks the most secure
         mechanism available based on the server version. For possible
         values, see the server documentation for the
         :manual:`authMechanism option
         </reference/connection-string/#urioption.authMechanism>`.

   * - **authSource**

       during the connection handshake. Can be used for server logs and
       profiling.

       | **Default**: ``null``

   * - **compressors**
     - string
     - Specifies one or more compression algorithms that the driver
       will attempt to use to compress requests sent to the connected
       MongoDB instance. Possible values include: ``zlib``, ``snappy``,
       and ``zstd``.

       | **Default**: ``null``

   * - **zlibCompressionLevel**
     - integer
     - Specifies the degree of compression that `Zlib <https://zlib.net/>`__
       should use to decrease the size of requests to the connected MongoDB
       instance. The level can range from ``-1`` to ``9``, with lower values
       compressing faster (but resulting in larger requests) and larger values
       compressing slower (but resulting in smaller requests).

       | **Default**: ``null``

   * - **retryWrites**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that the driver must retry supported write operations
       if they fail due to a network error.

     - Specifies which server monitoring protocol the driver uses. When set to
       ``auto``, the monitoring mode is determined by the environment in which
       the driver is running. The driver uses ``poll`` mode in function-as-a-service
       (FaaS) environments and ``stream`` mode in other environments.

       | **Default**: ``auto``

   * - **uuidRepresentation**
     - string
     - Specifies the UUID representation to use for read and write
       operations. For more information, see the driver documentation
       for the

     - string
     - Specifies the service name of the
       `SRV resource records <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2782>`__
       the driver retrieves to construct your 
       :manual:`seed list </reference/glossary/#std-term-seed-list>`.
       You must use the 
       :manual:`DNS Seed List Connection Format </reference/connection-string/#dns-seed-list-connection-format>`
       in your
       :ref:`connection URI <connection-uri>`
       to use this option. 
       
       | **Default**: ``mongodb``
