MongoDB provides flexible data aggregation functionality with the
:dbcommand:`aggregate` command. For additional information about
aggregation consider the following resources:

- :doc:`/applications/aggregation`
- :doc:`/reference/aggregation`
- :doc:`/reference/sql-aggregation-comparison`

This document provides a number of practical examples that display the
capabilities of the aggregation framework. All examples use a publicly
available data set of all zipcodes and populations in the United
States.

Requirements
------------

:binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongo`, version 2.2 or later.

Aggregations using the Zip Code Data Set
----------------------------------------

To run you will need the zipcode data set. These data are available at:
`media.mongodb.org/zips.json <http://media.mongodb.org/zips.json>`_.
Use :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` to load this data set into your
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~

Each document in this collection has the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id": "10280",
     "city": "NEW YORK",
     "state": "NY",
     "pop": 5574,
     "loc": [
       -74.016323,
       40.710537
     ]
   }

In these documents:

- The ``_id`` field holds the zipcode as a string.

- The ``city`` field holds the city.

- The ``state`` field holds the two letter state abbreviation.

- The ``pop`` field holds the population.

- The ``loc`` field holds the location as a latitude longitude pair.

All of the following examples use the :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>` helper in the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell. :method:`aggregate() <db.collection.aggregate()>` provides a
wrapper around the :dbcommand:`aggregate` database command. See the
documentation for your :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>` for a
more idiomatic interface for data aggregation operations.

States with Populations Over 10 Million
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To return all states with a population greater than 10 million, use
the following aggregation operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.zipcodes.aggregate( { $group :
                            { _id : "$state",
                              totalPop : { $sum : "$pop" } } },
                          { $match : {totalPop : { $gte : 10*1000*1000 } } } )

Aggregations operations using the :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>` helper, process all documents on the
``zipcodes`` collection. :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>` connects a number of :ref:`pipeline
<aggregation-pipelines>` operators, which define the aggregation
process.

In the above example, the pipeline passes all documents in the
``zipcodes`` collection through the following steps:

- the :pipeline:`$group` operator collects all documents and
  creates documents for each state.

  These new per-state documents have one field in addition the
  ``_id`` field: ``totalPop`` which is a generated field using the
  :group:`$sum` operation to calculate the total value of all
  ``pop`` fields in the source documents.

  After the :pipeline:`$group` operation the documents in the
  pipeline resemble the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "_id" : "AK",
       "totalPop" : 550043
     }

- the :pipeline:`$match` operation filters these documents so that
  the only documents that remain are those where the value of
  ``totalPop`` is greater than or equal to 10 million.

  The :pipeline:`$match` operation does not alter the documents,
  which have the same format as the documents output by
  :pipeline:`$group`.

The equivalent :term:`SQL` for this operation is:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT state, SUM(pop) AS pop
          FROM zips
          GROUP BY state
          HAVING pop > (10*1000*1000)

Average City Population by State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To return the average populations for cities in each state, use the
following aggregation operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.zipcodes.aggregate( { $group :
                            { _id : { state : "$state", city : "$city" },
                              pop : { $sum : "$pop" } } },
                          { $group :
                          { _id : "$_id.state",
                            avgCityPop : { $avg : "$pop" } } } )

Aggregations operations using the :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>` helper, process all documents on the
``zipcodes`` collection. :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>` a number of :ref:`pipeline
<aggregation-pipelines>` operators that define the aggregation
process.

In the above example, the pipeline passes all documents in the
``zipcodes`` collection through the following steps:

- the :pipeline:`$group` operator collects all documents and
  creates new documents for every combination of the ``city`` and
  ``state`` fields in the source document.

  After this stage in the pipeline, the documents resemble the
  following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "_id" : {
         "state" : "CO",
         "city" : "EDGEWATER"
       },
       "pop" : 13154
     }

- the second :pipeline:`$group` operator collects documents by the
  ``state`` field and use the :group:`$avg` expression to
  compute a value for the ``avgCityPop`` field.

The final output of this aggregation operation is:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : "MN",
     "avgCityPop" : 5335
   },

.. Will uncomment this section when we get the SQL
   The equivalent :term:`SQL` for this operation is:

   .. code-block:: sql

Largest and Smallest Cities by State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To return the smallest and largest cities by population for each
state, use the following aggregation operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.zipcodes.aggregate( { $group:
                            { _id: { state: "$state", city: "$city" },
                              pop: { $sum: "$pop" } } },
                          { $sort: { pop: 1 } },
                          { $group:
                            { _id : "$_id.state",
                              biggestCity:  { $last: "$_id.city" },
                              biggestPop:   { $last: "$pop" },
                              smallestCity: { $first: "$_id.city" },
                              smallestPop:  { $first: "$pop" } } },

                          // the following $project is optional, and
                          // modifies the output format.

                          { $project:
                            { _id: 0,
                              state: "$_id",
                              biggestCity:  { name: "$biggestCity",  pop: "$biggestPop" },
                              smallestCity: { name: "$smallestCity", pop: "$smallestPop" } } } )

Aggregations operations using the :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>` helper, process all documents on the
``zipcodes`` collection. :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>` a number of :ref:`pipeline
<aggregation-pipelines>` operators that define the aggregation
process.

All documents from the ``zipcodes`` collection pass into the pipeline,
which consists of the following steps:

- the :pipeline:`$group` operator collects all documents and
  creates new documents for every combination of the ``city`` and
  ``state`` fields in the source documents.

  By specifying the value of ``_id`` as a sub-document that contains
  both fields, the operation preserves the ``state`` field for use
  later in the pipeline. The documents produced by this stage of the
  pipeline have a second field, ``pop``, which uses the
  :group:`$sum` operator to provide the total of the ``pop``
  fields in the source document.

  At this stage in the pipeline, the documents resemble the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "_id" : {
         "state" : "CO",
         "city" : "EDGEWATER"
       },
       "pop" : 13154
     }

- :pipeline:`$sort` operator orders the documents in the pipeline
  based on the value of the ``pop`` field from smallest to
  largest. This operation does not alter the documents.

- the second :pipeline:`$group` operator collects the documents in
  the pipeline by the ``state`` field, which is a field inside the
  nested ``_id`` document.

  Within each per-state document this :pipeline:`$group` operator
  specifies four fields: Using the :group:`$last` expression,
  the :pipeline:`$group` operator creates the ``biggestcity`` and
  ``biggestpop`` fields that store the city with the largest
  population and that population. Using the :group:`$first`
  expression, the :pipeline:`$group` operator creates the
  ``smallestcity`` and ``smallestpop`` fields that store the city with
  the smallest population and that population.

  The documents, at this stage in the pipeline resemble the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "_id" : "WA",
       "biggestCity" : "SEATTLE",
       "biggestPop" : 520096,
       "smallestCity" : "BENGE",
       "smallestPop" : 2
     }

- The final operation is :pipeline:`$project`, which renames the
  ``_id`` field to ``state`` and moves the ``biggestCity``,
  ``biggestPop``, ``smallestCity``, and ``smallestPop`` into
  ``biggestCity`` and ``smallestCity`` sub-documents.

The final output of this aggregation operation is:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "state" : "RI",
     "biggestCity" : {
       "name" : "CRANSTON",
       "pop" : 176404
     },
     "smallestCity" : {
       "name" : "CLAYVILLE",
       "pop" : 45
     }
   }

Aggregation with User Preference Data
-------------------------------------

Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~

Consider a hypothetical sports club with a database that contains a
``user`` collection that tracks user's join dates, sport preferences,
and stores these data in documents that resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id : "jane",
     joined : ISODate("2011-03-02"),
     likes : ["golf", "racquetball"]
   }
   {
     _id : "joe",
     joined : ISODate("2012-07-02"),
     likes : ["tennis", "golf", "swimming"]
   }

.. redacting following section, upon request of Mathias.

   Return a Single Field
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The following operation uses :pipeline:`$project` to return only the
   ``_id`` field and to return it for all documents in the ``users``
   collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.users.aggregate(
        [
          { $project : { _id:1 } }
        ]
      )

   The operation returns results that resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "_id" : "joe"
      },
      {
        "_id" : "jane"
      },
      {
        "_id" : "jill"
      }

   For basic query and projection operations, standard queries with the
   :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` method are preferable. This
   operation appears as an hypothetical example only.

.. end-redaction

Normalize and Sort Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation returns user names in upper case and in
alphabetical order. The aggregation includes user names for all documents in
the ``users`` collection. You might do this to normalize user names for
processing.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.aggregate(
     [
       { $project : { name:{$toUpper:"$_id"} , _id:0 } },
       { $sort : { name : 1 } }
     ]
   )

All documents from the ``users`` collection passes through the
pipeline, which consists of the following operations:

- The :pipeline:`$project` operator:

  - creates a new field called ``name``.

  - converts the value of the ``_id`` to upper case, with the
    :expression:`$toUpper` operator. Then the
    :pipeline:`$project` creates a new field, named ``name``
    to hold this value.

  - suppresses the ``id`` field. :pipeline:`$project` will pass
    the ``_id`` field by default, unless explicitly suppressed.

- The :pipeline:`$sort` operator orders the results by the
  ``name`` field.

The results of the aggregation would resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "name" : "JANE"
   },
   {
     "name" : "JILL"
   },
   {
     "name" : "JOE"
   }

.. todo:: resolve the following commented block:

.. removed the following block until we can get it corrected. It would
   be ok to delete eventually.

   <bg> I think this example needs reworking. I don't think it returns
        the top 4 months that people tend to join the club, just the
        first four in the calendar year. For example, if people joined
        as follows: Jan 1 person, Feb 2, Mar 2, Apr 1, June 100, the
        query would still return Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr.

   <tycho> Agreed, it would need to group by month joined, and then
           sort those documents.

   Determine Most Common Join Month in Collection
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.users.aggregate(
        [
          { $project : { month_joined : { $month : "$joined" } } },
          { $sort : { month_joined : 1 } },
          { $limit : 4 }
        ]
      )

   The pipeline passes all documents in the ``users`` collection through
   the following operations:

   - The :pipeline:`$project` operator creates a new field called ``month_joined``.

   - The :expression:`$month` operator converts the ``joined`` field to
     integer representations of the month. Then the :pipeline:`$project` operator
     assigns the values to the ``month_joined`` field.

   - The :pipeline:`$sort` operator sorts the results by the ``month_joined`` field.

   - The :pipeline:`$limit` operator limits the results to the first 4 result documents.

   The operation returns results that resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "_id" : "ruth",
        "month_joined" : 1
      },
      {
        "_id" : "harold",
        "month_joined" : 1
      },
      {
        "_id" : "kate",
        "month_joined" : 1
      },
      {
        "_id" : "jill",
        "month_joined" : 2
      }

.. end-comment

Return Usernames Ordered by Join Month
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following aggregation operation returns user names sorted by the
month they joined. This kind of aggregation could help generate
membership renewal notices.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.aggregate(
     [
       { $project : { month_joined : {
                                       $month : "$joined"
                                     },
                      name : "$_id",
                      _id : 0
                    },
       { $sort : { month_joined : 1 } }
     ]
   )

The pipeline passes all documents in the ``users`` collection through
the following operations:

- The :pipeline:`$project` operator:

  - Creates two new fields: ``month_joined`` and ``name``.

  - Suppresses the ``id`` from the results. The :method:`aggregate()
    <db.collection.aggregate()>` method includes the ``_id``, unless
    explicitly suppressed.

- The :expression:`$month` operator converts the values of the
  ``joined`` field to integer representations of the month. Then the
  :pipeline:`$project` operator assigns those values to the
  ``month_joined`` field.

- The :pipeline:`$sort` operator sorts the results by the
  ``month_joined`` field.

The operation returns results that resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "month_joined" : 1,
     "name" : "ruth"
   },
   {
     "month_joined" : 1,
     "name" : "harold"
   },
   {
     "month_joined" : 1,
     "name" : "kate"
   }
   {
     "month_joined" : 2,
     "name" : "jill"
   }

Return Total Number of Joins per Month
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation shows how many people joined each month of the
year. You might use this aggregated data for such information for recruiting and marketing
strategies.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.aggregate(
     [
       { $project : { month_joined : { $month : "$joined" } } } ,
       { $group : { _id : {month_joined:"$month_joined"} , number : { $sum : 1 } } },
       { $sort : { "_id.month_joined" : 1 } }
     ]
   )

The pipeline passes all documents in the ``users`` collection through
the following operations:

- The :pipeline:`$project` operator creates a new field called
  ``month_joined``.

- The :expression:`$month` operator converts the values of the
  ``joined`` field to integer representations of the month. Then the
  :pipeline:`$project` operator assigns the values to the
  ``month_joined`` field.

- The :pipeline:`$group` operator collects all documents with a
  given ``month_joined`` value and counts how many documents there are
  for that value. Specifically, for each unique value,
  :pipeline:`$group` creates a new "per-month" document with two
  fields:

  - ``_id``, which contains a nested document with the
    ``month_joined`` field and its value.

  - ``number``, which is a generated field. The :group:`$sum`
    operator increments this field by 1 for every document containing
    the given ``month_joined`` value.

- The :pipeline:`$sort` operator sorts the documents created by
  :pipeline:`$group` according to the contents of the
  ``month_joined`` field.

The result of this aggregation operation would resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : {
       "month_joined" : 1
     },
     "number" : 3
   },
   {
     "_id" : {
       "month_joined" : 2
     },
     "number" : 9
   },
   {
     "_id" : {
       "month_joined" : 3
     },
     "number" : 5
   }

Return the Five Most Common "Likes"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following aggregation collects top five most "liked" activities in
the data set. In this data set, you might use an analysis of this to
help inform planning and future development.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.aggregate(
     [
       { $unwind : "$likes" },
       { $group : { _id : "$likes" , number : { $sum : 1 } } },
       { $sort : { number : -1 } },
       { $limit : 5 }
     ]
   )

The pipeline begins with all documents in the ``users`` collection,
and passes these documents through the following operations:

- The :pipeline:`$unwind` operator separates each value in the
  ``likes`` array, and creates a new version of the source document
  for every element in the array.

  .. example::

     Given the following document from the ``users`` collection:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          _id : "jane",
          joined : ISODate("2011-03-02"),
          likes : ["golf", "racquetball"]
        }

     The :pipeline:`$unwind` operator would create the following
     documents:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {
          _id : "jane",
          joined : ISODate("2011-03-02"),
          likes : "golf"
        }
        {
          _id : "jane",
          joined : ISODate("2011-03-02"),
          likes : "racquetball"
        }

- The :pipeline:`$group` operator collects all documents the same
  value for the ``likes`` field and counts each grouping. With this
  information, :pipeline:`$group` creates a new document with two
  fields:

  - ``_id``, which contains the ``likes`` value.

  - ``number``, which is a generated field. The :group:`$sum`
    operator increments this field by 1 for every document containing
    the given ``likes`` value.

- The :pipeline:`$sort` operator sorts these documents by the
  ``number`` field in reverse order.

- The :pipeline:`$limit` operator only includes the first 5 result
  documents.

The results of aggregation would resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : "golf",
     "number" : 33
   },
   {
     "_id" : "racquetball",
     "number" : 31
   },
   {
     "_id" : "swimming",
     "number" : 24
   },
   {
     "_id" : "handball",
     "number" : 19
   },
   {
     "_id" : "tennis",
     "number" : 18
   }
