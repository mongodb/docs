  The code example performs the following tasks:

  - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
  - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
  - Runs a query that uses:

    - :pipeline:`$search` stage to look for a term
    - :pipeline:`$limit` stage to limit the output to 5 results
    - :pipeline:`$project` stage to exclude all fields except ``title`` 
      and ``plot``

  - Prints the documents that match the query from the ``AggregateFlow`` instance.
