You can bring data from existing MongoDB deployments, ``JSON``, or ``CSV``
files into deployments in |service| using either:

- live migration where |service| assists you, or
- tools for a self-guided migration of data from your existing deployments
  into |service|.

MongoDB {+c2c-version+} and Later: Live Migrate to Atlas
----------------------------------------------

If both the source and destination {+clusters+} are running MongoDB {+c2c-version+} or
later, you can migrate your data from a source {+cluster+} into |a-service|
MongoDB {+cluster+} using one of the following types of guided live migration
in the |service| UI:

- Live migration (pull). For instructions, see :ref:`c2c-pull-live-migration`.
- Live migration (push). For instructions, see :ref:`c2c-push-live-migration`.

Earlier MongoDB Versions: Live Migrate to Atlas
-----------------------------------------------

If you are migrating MongoDB versions earlier than {+c2c-version+}, use one of the
following migration methods, depending on your deployment's requirements
and configuration.

   * - Source Cluster Configuration
     - Import Strategy

   * - A MongoDB deployment running MongoDB earlier than {+c2c-version+} that isn't
       monitored by |com|.

     - Use :ref:`live migration (pull) <live-migration>` where |service|
       **pulls** data from the source deployment and requires access to
       the source deployment through the deployment's firewall.

   * - A MongoDB deployment running MongoDB earlier than {+c2c-version+} that is
       monitored by |com|.

     - Use :ref:`live migration (push) <migrate-from-com>` where |com|
       **pushes** data to |service| using a secure :term:`link-token` without
       requiring access to the source cluster through the cluster's firewall.

       For source and destination {+clusters+} running MongoDB {+c2c-version+},
       push live migration is currently disabled. See :ref:`c2c-intro`.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-c2c.rst

   * - A shared multi-tenant {+cluster+}, or a {+cluster+} where you have no
       access to the oplog, or a {+cluster+} that runs a MongoDB version
       that is no longer supported.

     - Use :doc:`mongorestore </import/mongorestore>`.

   * - A standard "single :term:`shard`" :term:`sharded cluster` MongoDB
       deployment in Compose.

     - `Migrate from Compose to MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/cloud/migrate-from-compose/>`__.

   * - A replica set in |aws|.

     - `Migrate a MongoDB Replica Set from AWS to MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/cloud/migrate-from-aws-to-atlas/>`__.

Additional Reference
--------------------

.. include:: /includes/serverless-move-data-options.rst

- To load data into a new {+cluster+} in |service|, see :ref:`Load Sample Data <sample-data>`.
- To make a copy of your {+cluster+} for testing purposes, see :manual:`MongoDB Backup Methods </core/backups>`.
- If the application that you want to migrate requires a near-continuous
  uptime, contact :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>` and share your
  uptime requirements and {+cluster+} configuration.
