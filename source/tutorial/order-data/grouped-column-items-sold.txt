*Time to Complete: 5 minutes*

By visualizing which items are sold most commonly at each store, you
can help ensure each store is properly stocked with the items they
are most likely to sell out of. A grouped
:ref:`column chart <column-bar-chart-ref>` creates a group within the
chart for each store location and display columns within each group
reflecting the relative sales of each item.

Now that we have a few charts the dashboard is starting to get a bit
crowded. Follow along to the next section of the tutorial to see how we
can :ref:`rearrange and resize <order-data-rearrange-resize>` the
charts to make the dashboard easier to digest.
