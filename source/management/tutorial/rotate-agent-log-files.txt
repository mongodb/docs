Rotate Agent Log Files

Overview
--------

During normal operation, the monitoring agent and backup agent report a live
account of all activity and operations to a log file. When a log file reaches a
user-specified limit, the file must be replaced or rotated.

On Linux based systems, **logrotate** software automatically copies,
renames, compresses, and removes older archived log files.

For programs that cannot be told to close its log file, the
**copytruncate** command is available to adapt the log rotation process.
This command also allows rotating log files without restarting the backup and
monitoring agents.

Log Rotation With logrotate
---------------------------

**logrotate** is installed on most Linux systems. Check the
:file:`logrotate.conf` configuration file exists in the ``/etc`` folder or install
the **logrotate** package.

The behavior of the **logrotate** command is set in the
:file:`logrotate.conf` configuration file. Open this file then add entries and
directives for the monitoring and backup agent log files.

The :file:`logrotate.conf` file includes a set of directives in a structured
format, for example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   #sample configuration file
   compress
      
   <backup agent log file path> {
       size 10M
       copytruncate
   }

   <monitoring agent log file path> {
       daily
       copytruncate
   }

In this example, the entries and directives in the :file:`logrotate.conf`
configuration file will rotate the backup agent log file once it exceeds 10MB
in size and compress the old file using gzip (default). The monitoring agent
log file will be updated daily and compressed using gzip. The copytruncate
directive ensures both MMS agents do not have to be restarted for **logrotate**
to complete rotation of log files.

These configuration directives are described below. Other directives are
available, as described in the **logrotate** man page linked in the Additional
Information section below.

Common logrotate Configuration Directives
---------------------------------------------

compress
~~~~~~~~

sets a global option to compress log files after each file is rotated. This
directive can be placed within each entry if compression is needed for one
agent log file but not another.

<backup agent log file path> or <monitoring agent log file path>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

sets commands specific to the backup agent or monitoring agent log file. The
names and locations of backup and monitoring agent log files are set when the
agents are installed. The default log file path location is
``/log/mms-agent/*log``

size
~~~~

rotates the log file once it exceeds 10 megabytes in size. The file size is
configurable.
  
copytruncate
~~~~~~~~~~~~

rotates the log file without shutting down the agent software. This directive
copies the contents of the current log file to a new archive file then deletes
the contents of the current log file. New log activity is added to the now
empty current log file. The directive can be used to rotate logs file without
restarting the backup and monitoring agents.
    
When **copytruncate** is used, the :program:`create` command option has no
effect because the old log file stays in place. There also is a very small time
window between copying the log file and emptying it. Some logging data may be
lost with this method.

daily, weekly, monthly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If logs must be rotated ``daily`` or ``weekly`` or ``monthly``, then these
directives should be used and the ``size`` directive removed. Size does not
work in conjunction with frequency.

Global and Local Scope for Configuration Directives
---------------------------------------------------

Configuration directives have either a global scope or local scope.

In the example above, **compress** is a global configuration directive and
**size** and **copytruncate** are local directives. Global directives are
placed at the top of the :file:`logrotate.conf` file and apply to all log files
defined within the file. Local directives appear only in a specific log file
definition in the :file:`logrotate.conf` file. Local configuration directives
have no effect on other log files.
