Overview
--------

You can perform find operations to retrieve data from your MongoDB database.
You can perform a find operation to match documents on a set of criteria
by calling the ``find()`` or ``findOne()`` method.

.. tip:: Interactive Lab
   
   You can complete a short interactive lesson that demonstrates how to
   retrieve data by using the ``find()`` method in an in-browser coding
   experience. To learn more, see the :ref:`node-retrieve-instruqt-lab`
   section of this guide.

You can also further specify the information that the find operation
returns by specifying optional parameters or by chaining other methods,
as shown in the following guides:

- :ref:`node-fundamentals-sort`
- :ref:`node-fundamentals-skip`
- :ref:`node-fundamentals-limit`
- :ref:`node-fundamentals-project`

You can also use an aggregation operation to retrieve data. This type of
operation allows you to apply an ordered pipeline of transformations to the
matched data.

If you want to monitor the database for incoming data that matches a set of
criteria, you can use the watch operation to be notified in real-time when
matching data is inserted.

Find Documents
--------------

You can call the ``find()`` method on a ``Collection`` object. The
method accepts a query document that describes the documents you want to
retrieve. For more information on how to specify your query document,
see the :ref:`node-fundamentals-query-document` guide.

.. tip:: No Query Criteria
   
   To execute a find operation that has no query criteria, you can
   pass an empty query or omit the query document in your find
   method parameters.

   The following operations both return all documents in the
   ``myColl`` collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      await myColl.find(); // no query
      await myColl.find({}); // empty query
   
   If you don't pass a query or pass an empty query
   to the ``findOne()`` method, the operation returns a single
   document from a collection.

   You can specify options in a find operation even when you pass an
   empty query. For example, the following code shows how you can
   specify a projection as an option while executing a find operation
   with an empty query parameter:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      const options = {
        projection: { _id: 0, field1: 1 },
      };

      const findResult = await myColl.findOne({}, options);

If you resolve the ``Promise`` returned by ``find()``, you receive
a reference to a ``Cursor`` with which you can navigate matched documents.
If you resolve the ``Promise`` returned by ``findOne()``, you receive the
matching document or ``null`` if there are no matches.

.. example::

   A pizza restaurant wants to find all pizzas ordered by Lemony Snicket
   yesterday. They run the following ``find()`` query on the
   ``orders`` collection:

   .. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/pizza.js
      :language: javascript
      :start-after: start find crud example
      :end-before: end find crud example

   Once the operation returns, the ``findResult`` variable references a
   ``Cursor``. You can print the documents retrieved using the ``for await...of``
   syntax as shown below:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      for await (const doc of findResult) {
        console.log(doc);
      }

   The output might resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      [
        { name: "Lemony Snicket", type: "horseradish pizza", qty: 1, status: "delivered", date: ... },
        { name: "Lemony Snicket", type: "coal-fired oven pizza", qty: 3, status: "canceled", date: ...},
        ...
      ]

See the :ref:`find() <node-usage-find>` and :ref:`findOne()
<node-usage-findone>` for fully-runnable examples.

Aggregate Data from Documents
-----------------------------

If you want to run a custom processing pipeline to retrieve data from your
database, you can use the ``aggregate()`` method. This method accepts
aggregation expressions to run in sequence. These expressions let you filter,
group, and arrange the result data from a collection.

.. example::

   A pizza restaurant wants to run a status report on-demand to
   summarize pizza orders over the past week. They run the following
   ``aggregate()`` query on the ``orders`` collection to fetch the
   totals for each distinct "status" field:

   .. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/pizza.js
      :language: javascript
      :start-after: start aggregate crud example
      :end-before: end aggregate crud example

   Once the operation returns, the ``aggregateResult`` variable references a
   ``Cursor``. You can print the documents retrieved using the ``for await...of``
   syntax as shown below:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      for await (const doc of aggregateResult) {
        console.log(doc);
      }

   The output might resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      [
        { _id: 'delivering', count: 5 },
        { _id: 'delivered', count: 37 },
        { _id: 'created', count: 9 }
      ]

See the MongoDB server manual pages on :manual:`aggregation </aggregation>`
for more information on how to construct an aggregation pipeline.

.. _node-fundamentals-watch:

Monitor Data Changes
--------------------

You can use the ``watch()`` method to monitor a collection for changes to
a collection that match certain criteria. These changes include inserted,
updated, replaced, and deleted documents. You can pass this method
a pipeline of aggregation commands that sequentially runs on the changed
data whenever write operations are executed on the collection.

.. example::

   A pizza restaurant wants to receive a notification whenever a new pizza
   order comes in. To accomplish this, they create an aggregation pipeline
   to filter on insert operations and return specific fields. They pass
   this pipeline to the ``watch()`` method called on the ``orders``
   collection as shown below:

   .. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/pizza.js
      :language: javascript
      :start-after: start watch crud example
      :end-before: end watch crud example

For a runnable example of the ``watch()`` method using the NodeJS driver, see
the :ref:`change streams <node-usage-watch>` usage example.
