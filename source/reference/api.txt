MMS Public API
==============

The MMS Public API follows the principles of the REST architectural style to
expose a number of internal resources which enable programmatic access to MMS's
features. Some highlights of API include:

- **JSON throughout** - All entities are expressed in JSON.

- **Digest authentication** - To ensure that your API key is never sent over the
  network, API requests are authenticated using `HTTP Digest Authentication`_.

- **Browsable interface** - Using a consistent linking mechanism, you can
  browse the entire API by starting at the root resource and following links to
  related resources.

.. only:: saas


   - **Security** - In addition to Digest Authentication, the API is only
     accessible via HTTPS, and certain calls requiring even more security are
     protected by a user-defined whitelist. Further, an API user's capabilities
     are restricted by their assigned role(s). For example, a user with the
     ``Read Only`` role within a particular group will not be allowed to modify
     any resources within that group.

  For OnPrem, the above sentence about HTTPS may not apply. It depends on
  their server configuration.
