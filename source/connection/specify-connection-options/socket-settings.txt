Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about how the {+driver-short+} manages socket
settings. 

You can specify settings for your sockets by using either a :ref:`connection
string <connection-uri>` or by passing a ``MongoClientSettings`` object to the 
:ref:`MongoClients <mongoclient>` constructor. Select the :guilabel:`Connection String` or :guilabel:`MongoClientSettings` tab to see the options available:

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Connection String
    :tabid: uri

    .. list-table:: 
       :header-rows: 1 
       :widths: 25,20,60

       * - Option Name
         - Type
         - Description
        
       * - ``connectTimeoutMS``
         - integer
         - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the Java
           driver waits for a connection to open before timing out. A value of
           ``0`` instructs the driver to never time out while waiting for a
           connection to open. 
           
           *Default*: ``10000`` (10 seconds)
        
       * - ``socketTimeoutMS``
         - integer
         - Specifies the maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, the Java
           driver will wait to send or receive a request before timing out. A
           value of ``0`` instructs the driver to never time out while waiting
           to send or receive a request.
           
           *Default*: ``0``
    
    This example specifies that the driver will time out after 15 seconds of
    waiting for a connection to open: 
    
    .. code-block:: java

      ConnectionString connectionString = "mongodb://<host>:<port>/?connectTimeoutMS=15000"
      MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(connectionString)
    
    For more information about these parameters, see the `ConnectionString
    <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/ConnectionString.html>`__
    API documentation.

  .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
    :tabid: MongoClient
  
    Chain the `applyToSocketSettings() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#applyToSocketSettings(com.mongodb.Block)>`__
    method to modify the driver's behavior when connecting and communicating
    with your MongoDB deployment.

    The following table describes the methods you can chain to your settings
    to modify the driver's behavior:

    .. list-table::
      :widths: 40 60
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Method
        - Description

      * - ``applyConnectionString()``
        - Uses the settings from a ``ConnectionString`` object.

      * - ``applySettings()``
        - Uses the socket settings specified in a ``SocketSettings`` object.

      * - ``connectTimeout()``
        - Sets the maximum time to connect to an available socket before throwing
          a timeout exception.
          
          *Default*: ``10 seconds``

      * - ``readTimeout()``
        - Sets the maximum time to read from an available socket before throwing a
          timeout exception.
          
          *Default*: ``0``, which indicates no timeout

      * - ``receiveBufferSize()``
        - Sets the socket's buffer size when receiving.
          
          *Default*: The operating system default

      * - ``sendBufferSize()``
        - Sets the socket's buffer size when sending.
          
          *Default*: The operating system default

    .. note:: Connect to MongoDB by using a SOCKS5 Proxy

      You can chain the ``applyToProxySettings()`` method to your socket settings to
      connect to MongoDB by using a SOCKS5 proxy. To learn how to use a SOCKS5 proxy 
      and set proxy settings, see the :ref:`Connect to MongoDB by Using a SOCKS5 Proxy 
      <java-connect-socks>` guide. 

    .. _java-socketsettings-example:

    This example specifies the following driver behavior in a MongoDB socket:

    - To connect to an available socket within ``10 SECONDS``
    - To read from an available socket within ``15 SECONDS``

    .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/MCSettings.java
       :start-after: begin SocketSettings
       :end-before: end SocketSettings
       :language: java
       :emphasize-lines: 3-5
