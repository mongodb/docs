     Use lowercase. Hyphenate when used as a modifier.

   operating system
   OS
     *OS* is a common abbreviation for *operating system* and you can
     use it without first spelling it out if the context is clear. To
     form the plural of *OS*, add an *s* without an apostrophe—\
     *OSs*.

     However, if you feel that the context makes the use of *OS* or
     *OSs* confusing in a particular document, spell out the term in
     all instances in the document. If space is constrained (such as
     in a table or figure callout), use the abbreviated forms but
     explain them in text.

     If you mean the combination of operating system and hardware
     configuration, use *platform*.

   out-of-the-box
     This term describes a system, item, functionality, or feature
     that's usable without customization. Don't abbreviate as *OOTB*.

     When used as an adjective preceding a noun, the phrase is
     hyphenated, but when used as an adverb, it isn't hyphenated.

     Don't use *over* to indicate quantities; use *more than*
     instead. Also, don't use *over* to refer to version numbers.
