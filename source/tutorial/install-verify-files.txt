Verify Integrity of MongoDB Packages
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

For your security, MongoDB digitally signs all software packages to
certify MongoDB created the software and confirm the software is not
altered.

Use MD5 or a public key to validate the software signature before
installation and deployment. MD5 compares a hash generated by MongoDB from
the software. Public keys decrypt a hash generated from the software and
encrypted by MongoDB with a private key.

MongoDB signs each release branch with a different MD5 hash. The public
``.asc`` and ``.pub`` key files for each branch are available for
download. For example, the version 2.2 keys are at these URLs:

.. code-block:: ini

   https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-2.2.asc
   https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-2.2.pub

where ``2.2`` is the release number and the file extension is either
``.asc`` or ``.pub``. Replace ``2.2`` with the appropriate release number
to download public keys.

Keys currently are available for the 2.2., 2.4, and 2.6 releases.
