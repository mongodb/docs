We recommend deploying a service mesh in order to facilitate connectivity between 
resources in a multi-cluster sharded cluster deployment; however, if you would 
prefer to stand up a multi-cluster sharded cluster deployment without a service-mesh, 
you can follow this guide to configure the required networking between 
multi-cluster resources.

Sharded Cluster deployments over multiple |k8s| clusters without a service mesh 
require that each process is exposed externally and configured to identify itself 
by the externally available hostname. If the networking for each hostname is 
properly configured (i.e. the traffic when connecting on any given hostname is 
routed to a particular process/pod) then every other MongoDB process and clients 
can connect to all processes in the cluster. While the clients will be connecting 
only to mongos processes, exposing other components is necessary because in the 
sharded cluster deployment all processes must be able connect to every other 
process in the sharded cluster.

Procedure 
---------

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Prepare |k8s| clusters.

   .. step:: Configure the namespaces on each |k8s| cluster.

      1. We recommend that you use the ``kubectl mongodb`` plugin to perform the 
         necessary configuration (i.e. RBACs, service accounts and the |k8s| secret 
         for the |k8s-op-short| containing credentials to other |k8s| clusters) 
         automatically on all clusters. See :ref:`Multi-Cluster Sharded Cluster <mcsc-prereqs>` to learn more.
      
   .. step:: Install and configure the |k8s-op-short|.

      You can follow :ref:`this parallel procedure <deploy-om-multi-cluster>` 
      from the Multi-Cluster |onprem| deployment guide.

   .. step:: Deploy MongoDB resource.
      
      As shown in the following example, configure the ``type`` and ``topology``  
      as ``type=ShardedCluster`` and ``topology=MultiCluster``.

Example Details and Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The above example is not production ready. Please make note of the 
following details and considerations:

- The domain in the example (``kind-e2e-cluster-3.interconnected``) is 
  artificial and should be replaced with the proper externally accessible domain.

- The configuration uses TLS (it's not possible to securely expose externally 
  MongoDB processes without TLS) and x509 authentication. This can be configured 
  arbitrarily according to the needs. See the appropriate :ref:`Encryption <k8s-encryption>` and 
  :ref:`Authentication <k8s-authentication>` to learn more.

- The TLS certificates in sharded cluster must be issued for the 
  following components:

  - Each shard replica set
  - Config Server replica set
  - Mongos

- Each TLS certificate (``-cert`` secrets of TLS type, provided manually or issued 
  by cert-manager) must be provided in the |k8s| cluster where the |k8s-op-short| 
  is running. From there, the |k8s-op-short| automatically replicates necessary 
  resources (generated ``-cert-pem`` secrets) to the other |k8s| clusters.

- Each TLS certificate for each component must contain all the hostnames of all 
  processes of that component's replica set. For example, the certificate issued 
  for the first shard (index 0) must have in the cert's SANs field 
  the following hostnames (for each cluster it's deployed on; the pod name 
  follows the convention ``mdb-sharded-<shardIdx>-<clusterIdx>-<podIdxInThisCluster>``).

  - ``mdb-sharded-0-0-0.kind-e2e-cluster-1.interconnected``
  - ``mdb-sharded-0-1-0.kind-e2e-cluster-2.interconnected``
  - ``mdb-sharded-0-2-0.kind-e2e-cluster-3.interconnected``
  
- For reference, all the processes of the sharded cluster deployed with the 
  provided example are configured with the following hostnames:

  .. code-block::

     mdb-sharded-0-0-0.kind-e2e-cluster-1.interconnected (shard-0)
     mdb-sharded-0-1-0.kind-e2e-cluster-2.interconnected (shard-0)
     mdb-sharded-0-2-0.kind-e2e-cluster-3.interconnected (shard-0)
     mdb-sharded-config-0-0.kind-e2e-cluster-1.interconnected (cs)
     mdb-sharded-config-1-0.kind-e2e-cluster-2.interconnected (cs)
     mdb-sharded-config-2-0.kind-e2e-cluster-3.interconnected (cs)
     mdb-sharded-mongos-0-0.kind-e2e-cluster-1.interconnected (mongos)
     mdb-sharded-mongos-1-0.kind-e2e-cluster-2.interconnected (mongos)
     mdb-sharded-mongos-2-0.kind-e2e-cluster-3.interconnected (mongos)

- Each ``externalService:`` is defined with a default object ``{}``. 
  
  This means that the |k8s-op-short| creates the External Services 
  (services created for each pod which should be used to route the external 
  traffic to) with the default values:

  - ``type: LoadBalancer``
  - ``ports: 27017``, ``27018`` for backup purposes

-  Depending on the cluster configuration and load balancer controller in the 
   |k8s| cluster, using LoadBalancer type for external services will cause 
   provisioning of load balancer resources for each of the processes in the 
   sharded clusters. This might lead to the large number of LoadBalancer 
   resources allocated. In the minimal deployment (1 mongos, 3-node config 
   server replica set, 1 shard of 3-node replica set) this creates 7 LoadBalancer 
   services.

   In order to minimize the number of LoadBalancer resources that are created, 
   we recommend that you configure external access with ClusterIP services, as 
   shown in the following example:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      - clusterName: kind-e2e-cluster-3
        externalAccess:
          externalDomain: kind-e2e-cluster-3.interconnected
          externalService:
            type: ClusterIP

-  With each process (pod) having one associated ClusterIP external service, 
   you need to create one external "entry point" proxy component to the 
   |k8s| cluster, which might be any proxy (e.g. HAProxy, Nginx) that supports 
   TLS Passthrough routing.

   - The proxy component must be deployed in each |k8s| cluster and exposed 
     externally on a hostname defined for the components in each cluster:

     - In the example above, each component (mongos, config server, shards) defined 
       for ``kind-e2e-cluster-3`` use externalDomain: ``externalDomain: kind-e2e-cluster-3.interconnected``

       This means, the proxy component should be configured to receive all 
       connections to ``*.kind-e2e-cluster-3.interconnected``.

       Each connection is be a hostname following the naming convention 
       ``<pod-name>.<externalDomain>``, for example: 

       Shard pod: ``mdb-sharded-0-2-0.kind-e2e-cluster-2.interconnected (mdb-sharded-<shardIdx>-<clusterIdx>-<podIdx>``

   - The proxy component should be configured such that any traffic (on ports ``27017`` or ``27018``) 
     is proxied (on a TCP level, without re-encrypting the traffic) to the 
     respective external service.

     - For example, for ``mdb-sharded-0-2-0-svc-external`` a generic rule might be 
       used when configuring the dispatching as ``<pod-name>.kind-e2e-cluster-2.interconnected`` 
       forwarded to ``<pod-name>-mdb-sharded-0-2-0-svc-external``.

- Note that the ``externalDomain`` used in the example is an artificial one. 
  It must be replaced with a proper domain name.

- The operator deploys all processes across the |k8s| clusters along with all 
  the necessary external services.

- Each external service in each cluster must receive external traffic on the 
  defined external domains. Until the networking is fully configured, the cluster 
  is not configured properly, because for the the replicaset to be configured, 
  the mongod processes need to be able to connect with each other for replication 
  purposes.

- When using external domains, all the networking (for replication and MongoDB 
  Agent to MongoDB connectivity) is by default routed via external domain, 
  which might not be efficient. One of the ways to improve it is to configure 
  networking or the DNS resolution inside the cluster so that the external 
  hostnames of the pods deployed in the same |k8s| clusters are resolved to the 
  cluster local IP address of the external services.
