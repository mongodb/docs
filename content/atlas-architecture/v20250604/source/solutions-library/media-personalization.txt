Solution Overview
-----------------

In today's evolving media landscape, the large amount of digital content
makes it difficult to capture audience attention. At the same time,
referral traffic from social media platforms is declining, which puts
additional pressure on traditional media outlets to drive engagement. As
a result, publishers are seeking ways to stabilize their user base and
enhance content engagement.

To overcome these challenges, publishers need to use data effectively to
create more engaging and personalized experiences for their users. With
MongoDB Atlas and `Atlas Vector Search
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search>`__, you
can build an AI-driven media platform that transforms content delivery
to users of large-scale media and publishing platforms. By analyzing
interactions and consumption patterns, this solution grasps what content
resonates with users and predicts what they are likely to engage with in
the future. These insights enable publishers to construct a personalized
content journey. 

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

The architecture below shows how you can build an AI-driven media
solution with MongoDB that incorporates advanced personalization
services, such as:

- Discovery and content suggestions
- Content summarization and reformating
- Keyword extraction
- Insights and dossiers automation

The following sections describe these services in more detail.

Discovery and Content Suggestions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This solution suggests content based on users' preferences and past
interactions by utilizing user data, behavioral analytics, and vectorization
of media items. This enhances user engagement and increases the likelihood
of converting free users into paying subscribers. MongoDB's 
Vector Search performs |knn| searches, optimizing how content
is matched by embedding vectors directly into MongoDB documents.
This means that you don't need to manage multiple applications or transfer
data between different database systems, which simplifies the architecture.
Additionally, MongoDB's scalability and resilience enable organizations
to scale their operations vertically or horizontally. You can also scale 
search nodes independently from operational database nodes to adapt to
the specific load scenario.

Content Summarization and Reformating
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users have a diverse array of consumption habits. This solution provides 
concise summaries and adapts content formatting based
on user preferences and device specifications.

Keyword Extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In traditional publishing workflows, selecting keywords requires content
creators to meticulously identify and incorporate relevant keywords. This
process can be time-consuming and prone to human error, as significant keywords
can be overlooked which can diminish the content's visibility and engagement.

With the help of the underlying LLM, this solution draws essential 
information through keyword extraction, enabling users to grasp key 
news dimensions and enhancing the searchability of content within the 
platform. Keywords significantly influence the :abbr:`SEO (Search Engine Optimization)` 
performance of digital content.

Insights and Dossiers Automation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This solution automatically generates comprehensive insights and
dossiers from multiple articles, which is helpful for users who want
to learn in-depth about specific topics or events. This capability
uses one or more LLMs to generate natural language output, derived
from multiple source articles. You can integrate any leading language
model that fits your requirements. Here's how this process works:

- **Integration with multiple sources:** The system uses Atlas
  Vector Search to pull content from a variety of articles and data
  sources. This content is then compiled into dossiers, which provide
  users with a detailed and contextual exploration of topics and are
  curated to offer a narrative or analytical perspective beyond the
  original content.

- **Customizable output:** You can customize the system output by setting
  parameters based on your audience's preferences or your specific project
  requirements. This includes adjusting the level of detail, the amount of
  technical terms, and the inclusion of multimedia elements.

You can reuse the core concepts of this solution across other industries
such as retail, where presenting the right products to the right users is
essential to keep sales high.

You can use `Voyage AI <https://www.voyageai.com/>`__ to generate your
embeddings. To perform vector search, create a vector index in MongoDB Atlas
with the following configuration:
