MongoDB is an open-source document database that provides high
performance, high availability, and automatic scaling.

Document Database
-----------------

A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed
of field and value pairs. MongoDB documents are similar to JSON
objects. The values of fields may include other documents, arrays,
and arrays of documents.

The advantages of using documents are:

- Documents (i.e. objects) correspond to native data types in
  many programming languages.

- Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins.

- Dynamic schema supports fluent polymorphism.

Key Features
------------

High Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides high performance data persistence. In particular,

- Support for embedded data models reduces I/O activity on database
  system.

- Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded
  documents and arrays.

Rich Query Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports a rich query language to support :doc:`read and write
operations </crud>` as well as:

- :doc:`data aggregation </core/aggregation-pipeline>`

- :query:`Text Search <$text>` and :doc:`Geospatial Queries
  </tutorial/geospatial-tutorial>`.

High Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB's replication facility, called :doc:`replica set
</replication>`, provides:

- *automatic* failover and

- data redundancy.

A :doc:`replica set </replication>` is a group of
MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy
and increasing data availability.

Horizontal Scalability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides horizontal scalability as part of its *core*
functionality:

- :ref:`Sharding <sharding-introduction>` distributes data across a
  cluster of machines.

- Tag aware sharding allows for directing data to specific shards, such
  as to take into consideration geographic distribution of the shards.

Support for Multiple Storage Engines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports :doc:`multiple storage engines
</core/storage-engines>`, such as:

- :doc:`/core/wiredtiger` and

- :doc:`/core/mmapv1`.

In addition, MongoDB provides pluggable storage engine API that allows
third parties to develop storage engines for MongoDB.
