Default MongoDB Read Concerns/Write Concerns
============================================

.. COMMENT Since the immediate need is for the default read/write concerns and the content will be restricted to just those, this page is currently titled as default read/write concern.
   However, going forward, this page could be a 1-stop shop for
   defaults used in MongoDB and as such the file itself is named
   mongodb-defaults in anticipation of future work.

Default Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :red:`default` :ref:`read concern <read-concern>` is as
follows:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 45 55
   
   * - Operations
     - Default Read Concern

   * - Reads against primary

     - :readconcern:`"local"`

       - This read concern can return data that may be rolled
         back.

       - This read concern :red:`does not` guarantee :ref:`causal
         consistency <sessions>`.

   * - | Reads against secondaries.

     - :readconcern:`"local"`

       - This read concern can return data that may be rolled
         back.

       - This read concern :red:`does not` guarantee :ref:`causal
         consistency <sessions>`.

   .. tab:: Operations outside Transactions
      :tabid: override-concern

      The following information applies to operations that are run
      outside :ref:`transactions <transactions>`. For read concern
      information related to operations that are run inside
      transactions, click the ``Operations in Transactions`` tab.

      Using the :driver:`MongoDB drivers </>`, you can override the default 
      :ref:`read concern <read-concern>` and set read concern for operations 
      at the following levels:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 25 75

         * - Level

           - Description

         * - Client level

           - Applies to operations unless a finer-grained read concern for an
             operation is set at the database/collection/operation level.

         * - Database level

           - Applies to operations on the database's collections
             (i.e. overrides the client read concern) unless a read
             concern has been set at the collection level or the operation
             level.

             Does not apply to operations inside transactions.

         * - Collection level

           - Applies for read operations on the collection (i.e. overrides
             the database/client read concern) unless a read concern has
             been set at the operation level.

             Does not apply to operations inside transactions.

         * - Operation level

           - Applies for the specific read operation (i.e. overrides the
             database/client/collection read concern).

             The ability to set read concern at the operation depends on the
             driver. Refer to your :driver:`driver's documentation </>`.

             Does not apply to operations inside transactions.

   .. tab:: Operations in Transactions
      :tabid: override-concern-txn

      The following information applies to operations that are run
      inside :doc:`transactions </core/transactions>`. For read concern
      information related to operations that are run :red:`outside`
      transactions, click the ``Operations outside Transactions`` tab.

      Using the :driver:`MongoDB drivers </>`,you can override the default :doc:`read concern
      </reference/read-concern>` and set read concern **for transactions**
      at the following levels:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 25 75

         * - Level

           - Description

         * - Client level

           - Applies to transactions unless a finer-grained read concern
             is set at the session/transaction level.

             .. include:: /includes/default-transaction-read-concern.rst

         * - Session level

           - Applies to transactions started in the session (i.e. 
             overrides the client read concern) unless a finer-grained 
             read concern level is set at a specific transaction level.

             .. include:: /includes/default-transaction-read-concern.rst

             See :ref:`transactions-read-concern` for more information.

         * - Transaction level

           - Applies to the specific transaction (i.e. overrides the
             client/session read concern).

Causally Consistency Guarantees
-------------------------------

With :ref:`causally consistent client sessions <sessions>`, the
client sessions only guarantee causal consistency if:

- the associated read operations use :readconcern:`"majority"` read
  concern, and 

- the associated write operations use :writeconcern:`"majority"`
  write concern.
