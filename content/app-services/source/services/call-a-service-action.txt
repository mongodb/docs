Overview
--------

You can call actions associated with a :doc:`service </reference/services>` from
Atlas Functions, including incoming webhooks and triggers, or directly
from a connected client application. Each service action is available as
a method on its respective service client.

.. note::

   You must :doc:`configure a service rule
   </services/configure/service-rules>` that enables an action before
   you can call it.

The examples in this section demonstrate calling the :doc:`post()
</services/http-actions/http.post>` action from the
HTTP Service. Each service action follows a similar pattern but has
distinct parameters. For details on the parameters and usage of a
specific action, refer to that action's reference page.

Call from a Function
--------------------

To call a service action from a :doc:`function </functions>`:

1. Instantiate a service client from :ref:`function context
   <context-services>` using the ``context.services`` interface.

2. Call the method associated with the action.

.. code-block:: javascript

   const http = context.services.get("myHttpService");
   http.post({
       "url": "https://www.example.com",
       "headers": { "Content-Type": ["application/json"] },
       "body": { "msg": "Hello from a service action!" }
     })
     .then(() => "Successfully sent the post request!")
