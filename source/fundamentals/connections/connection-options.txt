Connection Options
==================

Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about MongoDB connection and authentication
options. You can set connection options as parameters of your
connection string to specify how your ``Client`` instance behaves while
connected to the server.

   * - Option Name
     - Accepted Values
     - Default Value
     - Description

   * - **appName**
     - String
     - None
     - | Specifies the application name that the ``Client`` instance sends
         to the server as part of the handshake.
       | Specifying an ``appName`` can help you use the server logs to
         determine which ``Client`` instance is connected to the server.

   * - **authMechanism**
     - String
     - None
     - Specifies which authentication mechanism to use. If you do not
       specify this option, the driver uses the default authentication
       mechanism. To learn more about authentication in the
       {+driver-short+}, see the guide on :ref:`rust-authentication`.

   * - **authMechanismProperties**
     - String
     - None
     - Specifies more properties for the authentication mechanism
       set in the ``authMechanism`` option.

   * - **authSource**
     - String
     - See description
     - | Specifies the database used to authenticate.
       | This option defaults to ``admin`` for SCRAM-based authentication mechanisms,
         ``$external`` for the ``MONGODB-X509`` mechanism, and the database name or
         ``$external`` for the ``PLAIN`` mechanism.

   * - **compressors**
     - A comma-separated list of strings
     - None
     - Specifies compressors that the ``Client`` instance uses in the specified order.
       To learn more about network compression, see the :ref:`rust-network-compression` guide.

   * - **connectTimeoutMS**
     - Non-negative integer
     - ``10000`` (10 seconds)
     - Specifies the connection timeout, in milliseconds, passed to each
       underlying TCP stream when attempting to connect to the server.

   * - **directConnection**
     - Boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether the ``Client`` instance directly connects to a single host
       instead of discovering and connecting to all servers in the cluster.

   * - **heartbeatFrequencyMS**
     - Integer greater than or equal to 500
     - ``10000`` (10 seconds)
     - Specifies the amount of time in milliseconds that each
       monitoring thread waits between performing server checks.

   * - **journal**
     - Boolean
     - ``false``
     - Requests acknowledgment that the operation propagated to the on-disk journal.

   * - **localThresholdMS**
     - Non-negative integer
     - 15
     - | Specifies the amount of time in milliseconds that the average
         round-trip time between the driver and server can last
         compared to the shortest round-trip time of all the suitable servers.
       | A value of ``0`` indicates that there is no latency window, so
         only the server with the lowest average round-trip time is
         eligible.

   * - **maxIdleTimeMS**
     - Non-negative integer
     - 0
     - | Specifies the amount of time in milliseconds that a connection
         can remain idle in a connection pool the server closes it.
       | A value of ``0`` indicates that the client does not close idle
         connections.

   * - **maxStalenessSeconds**
     - ``-1``, or any integer greater than or equal to ``90``
     - ``-1``
     - | Specifies the maximum lag, in seconds, behind the primary node
         that a secondary node can be to be considered for the given operation.
       | The value of this option must be at least ``90``, or the
         operation raises an error. A value of ``-1`` means there is no
         maximum lag.

   * - **maxPoolSize**
     - Non-negative integer
     - ``10``
     - | Specifies the maximum number of connections that the ``Client``
         instance can create in a connection pool for a given server.
       | If you attempt an operation while the value of ``maxPoolSize``
         connections are checked out, the operation waits until an
         in-progress operation finishes and the connection returns to the pool.

   * - **minPoolSize**
     - Non-negative integer
     - ``0``
     - | Specifies the minimum number of connections that are available in
         a server's connection pool at a given time.
       | If fewer than ``minPoolSize`` connections are in the pool,
         the server adds connections in the background up to the value of ``minPoolSize``.

   * - **readConcernLevel**
     - String
     - None
     - Specifies the default read concern for operations performed on the ``Client`` instance.
       To learn more, see :manual:`Read Concern </reference/read-concern/>` in the Server manual.

   * - **readPreference**
     - String
     - ``primary``
     - Specifies how the driver routes a read operation to members of a replica set.
       To learn more, see :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference>` in the Server manual.

   * - **readPreferenceTags**
     - A list of comma-separated key-value pairs
     - None
     - Specifies which replica set members are considered for operations.
       Each instance of this key is a separate tag set.
       The driver checks each tag set until it finds one or more servers
       with each tag in the set.

   * - **replicaSet**
     - String
     - None
     - Specifies the name of the replica set that the ``Client`` instance connects to.

   * - **retryReads**
     - Boolean
     - ``true``
     - Specifies whether the client retries a read operation if the operation fails.

   * - **serverSelectionTimeoutMS**
     - Non-negative integer
     - ``30000`` (30 seconds)
     - Specifies the amount of time in milliseconds that the
       ``Client`` instance waits when attempting to select a server for an
       operation before timing out.

   * - **tls**
     - Boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies the TLS configuration for the ``Client`` instance to use in its connections with the server.
       By default, TLS is off.

   * - **tlsAllowInvalidCertificates**
     - Boolean
     - ``false``
     - | Specifies whether the ``Client`` instance returns an error if the
         server presents an invalid certificate.
       | We recommend that you set this option to ``true`` only in
         testing environments to avoid creating vulnerabilities in your
         application.

   * - **tlsCAFile**
     - String
     - See description
     - | Specifies the path to the certificate authority (CA) file that
         the ``Client`` instance uses for TLS.
       | If you do not specify this option, the driver uses the Mozilla
         root certificates from the ``webpki-roots`` crate.

   * - **tlsCertificateKeyFile**
     - String
     - None
     - | Specifies the path to the certificate file that the ``Client``
         instance presents to the server to verify its identify.
       | If you do not set this option, the ``Client`` instance does not
         attempt to verify its identity to the server.

   * - **tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword**
     - String
     - None
     - Specifies the password to decrypt the private key
       in your certificate file, if the key is encrypted.

   * - **tlsInsecure**
     - Boolean
     - ``false``
     - | Specifies whether the ``Client`` instance returns an error if the
         server presents an invalid certificate.
       | We recommend that you set this option to ``true`` only in
         testing environments to avoid creating vulnerabilities in your
         application.

   * - **w**
     - Non-negative integer or string
     - None
     - | Requests acknowledgment that the operation has propagated to a
         specific number or variety of servers. 
       | To learn more, see :manual:`Write Concern
         </reference/write-concern>` in the Server manual.

   * - **wTimeoutMS**
     - Non-negative integer
     - No timeout
     - Specifies a time limit, in milliseconds, for the write concern.
       If an operation has not propagated to the requested level within
       the time limit, the driver raises an error.

   * - **zlibCompressionLevel**
     - Integer between -1 and 9 (inclusive)
     - ``-1``
     - | Specifies the level field of the ``zlib`` compression if you use that compressor.
       | Setting a value of ``-1`` selects the default compression level (``6``).
       | Setting a value of ``0`` specifies no compression, and setting
         a value of ``9`` specifies maximum compression.
       | To learn more about network compression, see the :ref:`rust-network-compression` guide.
