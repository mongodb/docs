.. admonition:: Database Triggers and Change Streams
   :class: note

   Database triggers, based on change streams, are available via
   MongoDB Stitch. Please review the `Database Triggers documentation
   <https://docs.mongodb.com/stitch/mongodb/triggers/>`_ for more
   information.

.. versionadded:: 3.6

Change streams allow applications to access real-time data changes
without the complexity and risk of tailing the :term:`oplog`.
Applications can use change streams to subscribe to all data changes on
a single collection, a database, or an entire deployment, and
immediately react to them. Because change streams use the aggregation
framework, applications can also filter for specific changes or
transform the notifications at will.

Change stream is available for :doc:`replica sets <replication>` and
:doc:`sharded clusters </sharding>` that use :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>` storage engine and replica set protocol version 1
(:rsconf:`pv1 <protocolVersion>`). Change streams can also be used on
deployments which employ MongoDB's
:ref:`encryption-at-rest<encrypted-storage-engine>` feature.

Connect
--------

Connections for a change stream can either use DNS seed lists
with the ``+srv`` connection option or by listing the servers individually
in the connection string.

If the driver loses the connection to a change stream or the connection goes
down, it attempts to reestablish a connection to the change stream through
another node in the cluster that has a matching 
:ref:`read preference <connections-read-preference>`. If the driver cannot find
a node with the correct read preference, it throws an exception.

For more information, see :ref:`Connection String URI Format <mongodb-uri>`.

Watch a Collection, Database, or Deployment
-------------------------------------------

You can open change streams against:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Target
     - Description

   * - A collection

     - You can open a change stream cursor for a single collection
       (except ``system`` collections, or any collections in the
       ``admin``, ``local``, and ``config`` databases).

       The examples on this page use the MongoDB drivers to open and
       work with a change stream cursor for a single collection. See
       also the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
       :method:`db.collection.watch()`.

   * - A database

     - Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can open a change stream cursor for
       a single database (excluding ``admin``, ``local``, and
       ``config`` database) to watch for changes to all its non-system
       collections.

       For the MongoDB driver method, refer to your driver
       documentation. See also the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
       :method:`db.watch()`.


   * - A deployment

     - Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can open a change stream cursor for
       a deployment (either a replica set or a sharded cluster) to
       watch for changes to all non-system collections across all
       databases except for ``admin``, ``local``, and ``config``.

       For the MongoDB driver method, refer to your driver
       documentation. See also the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
       :method:`Mongo.watch()`.

.. admonition:: Change Stream Examples
   :class: note

   The examples on this page use the MongoDB drivers to illustrate how
   to open a change stream cursor for a collection and work with the
   change stream cursor.

.. _open-change-stream:

.. important::

   Change stream is only available if :readconcern:`"majority"` read
   concern support is enabled (default).

Open A Change Stream
--------------------

.. container::

   .. tabs-pillstrip:: languages

   For a replica set, you can open change stream for any of the
   data-bearing members.

   For a sharded cluster, you must issue the open change stream operation
   against the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

   The following example opens a change stream for a collection and
   iterates over the cursor to retrieve the change stream documents.
   [#start-time]_ While the connection to the MongoDB deployment remains
   open, the cursor remains open until one of the following occurs:

   - The cursor is explicitly closed.

   - An :ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>` occurs.

   To retrieve the data change event notifications, iterate the change
   stream ``cursor``.

   .. note::
      The lifecycle of an unclosed cursor is language-dependent.

   See :ref:`change-stream-output` for more information on the change stream
   response document format.

.. [#start-time]

   Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can specify a ``startAtOperationTime``
   to open the cursor at a particular point in time. If the specified
   starting point is in the past, it must be in the time range of the
   oplog.

      If there are one or more majority-committed operations that modified

      lookup, the full document returned may differ significantly from the
      document at the time of the update operation.

      However, the deltas included in the change stream document always
      correctly describe the watched collection changes that applied to
      that change stream event.

Resume a Change Stream
----------------------

.. container::

   .. tabs-pillstrip:: languages

   Change streams are resumable by specifying a ``resumeAfter`` token when
   opening the cursor. For the ``resumeAfter`` token, use the ``_id``
   value of the :ref:`change stream event document
   <change-stream-output>`. Passing the ``_id`` value to the change stream
   attempts to resume notifications starting after the  specified operation.

   .. important::

      - The oplog must have enough history to locate the operation
        associated with the token or the timestamp, if the timestamp is in
        the past.

            In the example below, the ``resumeToken`` is retrieved from the last change stream document
            and passed to the ``Watch()`` method as an option. Passing the ``resumeToken``
            to the ``Watch()`` method directs
            the change stream to attempt to resume notifications starting after the
            operation specified in the resume token.

Resume Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``_id`` value of a :ref:`change stream event document
<change-stream-output>` acts as the resume token:

.. code-block:: none

   {
      "_data" : <BinData|hex string>
   }

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-resume-token-versions-4.0.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-resume-token-hex-change.rst

Use Cases
---------

Change streams can benefit architectures with reliant business systems,
informing downstream systems once data changes are durable. For example,
change streams can save time for developers when implementing Extract,
Transform, and Load (ETL) services, cross-platform synchronization,
collaboration functionality, and notification services.

Access Control
--------------

For deployments enforcing :ref:`authentication` and :ref:`authorization
<authorization>`:

- To open a change stream against specific collection, applications
  must have privileges that grant :authaction:`changeStream` and
  :authaction:`find` actions on the corresponding collection.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { resource: { db: <dbname>, collection: <collection> }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }

- To open a change stream on a single databases, applications must have
  privileges that grant :authaction:`changeStream` and
  :authaction:`find` actions on all non-``system`` collections in a
  database.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { resource: { db: <dbname>, collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }

- To open a change stream on an entire deployment, applications must
  have privileges that grant :authaction:`changeStream` and
  :authaction:`find` actions on all non-``system`` collections for all
  databases in the deployment.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { resource: { db: "", collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }

Event Notification
------------------

Change streams only notify on data changes that have persisted to a majority
of data-bearing members in the replica set. This ensures that notifications are
triggered only by majority-committed changes that are durable in failure
scenarios.

For example, consider a 3-member :term:`replica set` with a change stream
cursor opened against the :term:`primary`. If a client issues an insert
operation, the change stream only notifies the application of the data change
once that insert has persisted to a majority of data-bearing members.

If an operation is associated with a :doc:`multi-document transactions
</core/transactions>`, the change event document includes the
``txnNumber`` and the ``lsid``.
