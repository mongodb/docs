Overview
--------

**Polymorphic** objects inherit properties and methods from one or more parent classes.
These objects require special mapping to ensure that the {+driver-short+} correctly
serializes them to and from BSON documents.

This guide explains the following:

- How to deserialize polymorphic types
- The discriminator conventions included with the {+driver-short+}
- How to create custom discriminator conventions

The examples on this page use the following inheritance hierarchy:

.. code-block:: csharp
   
   public class Animal 
   {
   }

   public class Cat : Animal 
   {
   }

   public class Dog : Animal 
   {
   }

   public class Lion : Cat 
   {
   }

   public class Tiger : Cat 
   {
   }

Deserialize Polymorphic Objects
-------------------------------

Before the serializer can deserialize any polymorphic objects, you must document the
relationship of all classes in the inheritance hierarchy.

If you're using the automapper to map your classes, apply the ``[BsonKnownTypes]``
attribute to each base class in the hierarchy. Pass each class that directly inherits
from the base class as an argument.

The following example shows how to apply the ``[BsonKnownTypes]`` attribute to
classes in the example ``Animal`` hierarchy:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 1,6
   
   [BsonKnownTypes(typeof(Cat), typeof(Dog))]
   public class Animal 
   {
   }

   [BsonKnownTypes(typeof(Lion), typeof(Tiger))]
   public class Cat : Animal 
   {
   }

   public class Dog : Animal 
   {
   }

   public class Lion : Cat 
   {
   }

   public class Tiger : Cat 
   {
   }

.. note:: Using BsonKnownTypes

   Apply the ``[BsonKnownTypes]`` attribute only to parent classes. Pass as arguments
   only the types that *directly* inherit from the class, not all child classes in
   the hierarchy.

If you're creating a class map manually, call the
``BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<T>()`` method for every class in the hierarchy, as shown
in the following example:

.. code-block:: csharp
   
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Animal>();
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Cat>();
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Dog>();
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Lion>();
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Tiger>();

   To learn more about mapping classes, see the :ref:`csharp-class-mapping` documentation.

Use Discriminators
------------------

In MongoDB, a **discriminator** is a field added to a document to identify the class
to which the document deserializes. When a collection contains more than one type from a
single inheritance hierarchy, discriminators ensure that each
document deserializes to the right class. The {+driver-short+} stores the discriminator
value in a field named ``_t`` in the BSON document. Generally, ``_t`` is the second
field in the BSON document after ``_id``.

**Discriminator conventions** define the value stored in the discriminator field.
In this section, you can learn about the discriminator conventions included
with the {+driver-short+} and how to create custom discriminator conventions.

ScalarDiscriminatorConvention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the {+driver-short+} uses the ``ScalarDiscriminatorConvention``. According
to this convention, the {+driver-short+} sets the value of the ``_t`` field to the name of
the class from which the document was serialized.

Suppose you create an instance of the example ``Animal`` class and each of its 
subclasses. If you serialize these objects to a single collection, the 
{+driver-short+} applies the ``ScalarDiscriminatorConvention`` and the corresponding 
BSON documents appear as follows:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   
   { _id: ..., _t: "Animal", ... }
   { _id: ..., _t: "Cat", ... }
   { _id: ..., _t: "Dog", ... }
   { _id: ..., _t: "Lion", ... }
   { _id: ..., _t: "Tiger", ... }

The ``ScalarDiscriminatorConvention`` uses concise discriminator values, but can be
difficult to run a query on. For example, to find all documents of type or subtype ``Cat``,
you must explicitly list each class you're looking for:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true
   
   var query = coll.AsQueryable().Where(
       item => item.GetType() == typeof(Cat) ||
       item.GetType() == typeof(Lion) ||
       item.GetType() == typeof(Tiger));

.. _csharp-discriminator-hierarchical:

HierarchicalDiscriminatorConvention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To simplify queries against your collection of polymorphic types, you can use the
``HierarchicalDiscriminatorConvention``. According to this convention, the value of ``_t``
is an array of all classes in the inheritance hierarchy of the document's type.

To use the ``HierarchicalDiscriminatorConvention``, label the base class of your
inheritance hierarchy as the root class. If you're using the automapper,
label the root class by applying the
``[BsonDiscriminatorAttribute]`` attribute to the class and passing ``RootClass = true``
as an argument. The following code example labels the ``Animal`` class as the
root of the example inheritance hierarchy:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 1
   
   [BsonDiscriminator(RootClass = true)]
   [BsonKnownTypes(typeof(Cat), typeof(Dog)]
   public class Animal 
   {
   }

If you're creating a class map manually, call the ``SetIsRootClass()`` method and pass
``true`` as an argument when you register the class map for the root class. The following
code example registers class maps for all five example classes but labels only the
``Animal`` class as the root of the inheritance hierarchy:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true
   :emphasize-lines: 3 
   
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Animal>(classMap => {
       classMap.AutoMap();
       classMap.SetIsRootClass(true);
   });
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Cat>();
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Dog>();
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Lion>();
   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Tiger>();

Suppose you label the example ``Animal`` class as the root of the inheritance hierarchy,
and then create an instance of the ``Animal`` class and each of its
subclasses. If you serialize these objects to a single collection, the {+driver-short+}
applies the ``HierarchicalDiscriminatorConvention`` and the corresponding
BSON documents appear as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   { _id: ..., _t: "Animal", ... }
   { _id: ..., _t: ["Animal", "Cat"], ... }
   { _id: ..., _t: ["Animal", "Dog"], ... }
   { _id: ..., _t: ["Animal", "Cat", "Lion"], ... }
   { _id: ..., _t: ["Animal", "Cat", "Tiger"], ... }

.. important:: Root Class Discriminator

   Any document mapped to the root class still uses a string value for the discriminator
   field. 

When using the ``HierarchicalDiscriminatorConvention``, you can search for all
documents of type or subtype ``Cat`` by using a single boolean condition, as shown in
the following example:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true
   
   var query = coll.Aggregate().Match(a => a is Cat);

Custom Discriminator Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're working with data that doesn't follow the conventions used by the
{+driver-short+}--for example, data inserted into MongoDB by another driver or object
mapper--you might need to use a different value for your discriminator field to
ensure your classes align with those conventions.

If you're using the automapper, you can specify a custom value for a class's discriminator
field by applying the ``[BsonDiscriminator]`` attribute to the class and passing
the custom discriminator value as a string argument. The following code example
sets the value of the discriminator field for the ``Animal`` class to "myAnimalClass":

.. code-block:: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   [BsonDiscriminator("myAnimalClass")]
   public class Animal 
   {
   }

If you're creating a class map manually, call the ``SetDiscriminator()`` method and pass
the custom discriminator value as an argument when
you register the class map. The following code example sets the value of the
discriminator field for the ``Animal`` class to "myAnimalClass":

.. code-block:: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   BsonClassMap.RegisterClassMap<Animal>(classMap => 
   {
       classMap.AutoMap();
       classMap.SetDiscriminator("myAnimalClass");
   });

An instance of the previous ``Animal`` class appears as follows after serialization: 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": "...", "_t": "myAnimalClass"}
