   To add domains to the approved list, you can either:

      opens a modal containing domains from existing user email
      addresses in your organization. Use this list to easily enable
      access for users who are already part of your organization.

      Use the checkboxes to select the desired domains, then click
      :guilabel:`Add` to add them to the approved list.
    
   b. Click :guilabel:`Add Domains`. |service| opens a modal where
      you can manually add domains the approved list.

      Enter the domain you want approve in the input box, then
      click :guilabel:`Add`. Repeat this process for each domain you
      want to approve.

   .. note::

      If you have :ref:`restricted user membership to your federation
      <restrict-fed-user-membership>`, |service| warns you if you add a
      domain which is being used to access organizations outside of your
      federation.

   Once you have added all desired domains, click :guilabel:`Submit`.
