To monitor a backup restore job until it completes, you must have
:authrole:`Project Read Only` access or higher to the specific project.

To start a restore job, you must have :authrole:`Project Backup Manager` 
or :authrole:`Project Owner` access to the project.

For cross-organization or cross-project restores, the required permissions 
apply to both the source and target projects. You must have the necessary 
permissions: :authrole:`Project Backup Manager` or :authrole:`Project Owner` 
in both projects to initiate or manage such restore operations.
