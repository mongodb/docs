Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.


Prequisites
-----------

To downgrade from 4.2 to 4.0, you must remove incompatible features
that are persisted and/or update incompatible configuration settings.
These include:

.. _4.2-downgrade-features-prereq:

Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version (fCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV) to "4.0" and remove all persisted
fCV 4.2 features that are :ref:`incompatible with 4.0
<4.2-compatibility-enabled>`, such as:

- Indexes with a name that exceeds the :limit:`Index Name Length` limit.

- Indexes with keys that exceeds the :limit:`Index Key Limit`.

- Unique Indexes with new internal format.

For specific instructions to downgrade the fCV and remove these
features, see:

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-standalone`.

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-replica-set`.

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-sharded-cluster`.

``zstd`` Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using :term:`zstd` for data compression, journal compression, or
network messages requires additional considerations for downgrades.

For detailed instructions appropriate for your deployment type, see:

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-standalone`.

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-replica-set`.

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-sharded-cluster`.

``tls``-Prefixed Configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before downgrading the binaries, update ``tls``-prefixed configuration
options for ``ssl``-prefixed aliases.

For detailed instructions appropriate for your deployment type, see:

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-standalone`.

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-replica-set`.

- :doc:`/release-notes/4.2-downgrade-sharded-cluster`.
