  In the {{driver}}, see {{remove}} and {{drop}}.

  In MongoDB, write operations are atomic on the level of a single
  document. If a single remove operation removes multiple documents from
  a collection, the operation can interleave with other write operations
  on that collection. In the MongoDB Manual, see
  :manual:`Atomicity </core/write-operations-atomicity>`. 

  For all available update operators, see the :manual:`Update Operators
  </reference/operator/update>` reference page in the MongoDB Manual.
