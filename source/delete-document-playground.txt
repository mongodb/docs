You delete documents in a collection using the 
:manual:`MongoDB CRUD Operators </crud>` in a MongoDB Playground:

- Use the :manual:`deleteOne() 
  </reference/method/db.collection.deleteOne>` method to delete one
  document.
- Use the :manual:`deleteMany() 
  </reference/method/db.collection.deleteMany>` method to delete more 
  than one document.

Prerequisites
-------------

If you have not done so already, you must complete the following 
prerequisites before you can delete documents with a MongoDB Playground:

- :ref:`Create a connection to a MongoDB deployment 
  <vsce-connect-task>`.
- :ref:`Activate the connection to the MongoDB deployment 
  <vsce-activate-connection>`.
- :ref:`Open a MongoDB Playground <open-playground-for-crud-vsce>`.
- :ref:`vsce-create-doc-playground` or create documents in a collection
  using a different method..

Delete One Document
-------------------

To delete one document, use the following syntax in your Playground:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.deleteOne(
      <filter>,
      {
         writeConcern: <document>,
         collation: <document>
      }
   )

For a detailed description of this method's parameters,
see :manual:`deleteOne() </reference/method/db.collection.deleteOne>`
in the MongoDB Manual.

.. include:: /includes/run-playground.rst

Example
~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/blank-playground.rst

The following example:

1. Switches to the ``test`` database.
#. Deletes one document in the ``test.sales`` collection that matches 
   the query.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   use("test");

   db.sales.deleteOne(
     { "_id" : 1 }
   );

.. include:: /includes/fact-playground-results.rst

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     acknowleged: 1,
     deletedCount: 1
   }

Delete Many Documents
---------------------

To delete many documents, use the following syntax in your Playground:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.deleteMany(
      <filter>,
      {
         writeConcern: <document>,
         collation: <document>
      }
   )

For a detailed description of this method's parameters,
see :manual:`deleteMany() </reference/method/db.collection.deleteMany>`
in the MongoDB Manual.

.. include:: /includes/run-playground.rst

Example
~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/blank-playground.rst

The following example:

1. Switches to the ``test`` database.
#. Deletes all documents in the ``test.sales`` collection that match
   the query.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   use("test");

   db.sales.deleteMany(
     { "item" : "abc" }
   );

.. include:: /includes/fact-playground-results.rst

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
     acknowleged: 1,
     deletedCount: 3
   }
