.. pipeline:: $externalFunction

The :pipeline:`$externalFunction` stage triggers processes in a specific AWS 
Lambda resource. Your request to the AWS Lambda process can either be synchronous 
or asynchronous. 

Create an AWS Lambda and Authenticate with Unified AWS Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to call an AWS Lambda resource from within your {+atlas-sp+} pipeline, 
your AWS Lambda must be deployed to the same AWS region in which your {+atlas-sp+} 
is deployed. To learn more about deploying an AWS Lambda resource, see the 
`AWS documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`__.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create an AWS Lambda Function.
      
      With either the AWS CLI or through the AWS UI, `create a lambda function <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html>`__.

      .. note:: 

        - AWS Lambda resources must be created with an ``AWS_IAM`` authentication type,
          which requires that you create an AWS IAM `Role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html>`__ 
          and `Policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html>`__. 
        - Only the buffered, not streaming, response type is supported.

   .. step:: Configure Unified AWS Access.

      .. note:: 

         The procedure described here only covers the basic setup flow in the {+atlas-ui+}. 
         To learn more, see the the :ref:`Set Up Unified AWS Access <set-up-unified-aws-access>` 
         documentation.

      **Required Access**

      To set up unified |aws| access, you must have
      :authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner` access to
      the project.

      **Prerequisites**

      - An |service| :doc:`account </index>`.
      - The `AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html>`__.

      .. note:: 

         - Your AWS IAM policy must include the ``lambda:InvokeFunction`` action.
         - You must replace the placeholder ``ExternalId`` and ``Resource`` values 
           with your own, which are available through the Unified AWS Access 
           configuration process. Note that the ``ExternalId`` in this example 
           includes a wildcard that matches any Lambda Function with a name that 
           begins with ``function-``. 

   .. step:: Add Trust Relationships to an Existing Role in the {+atlas-ui+}

      ``permission-policy.json``

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/atlas-stream-processing/permission-policy.json

      1. Navigate to the AWS IAM integration page in your Atlas project and click on the 
         :guilabel:`Authorize an AWS IAM role` button.
      #. Create a new role (or modify an existing role) with the ``role-trust-policy.json`` 
         that is shown in the modal.
      #. Once the role is created (or the existing role is updated with the new 
         trust policy), paste the role's ARN in the modal.
      #. In the AWS console, go to :guilabel:`IAM` > :guilabel:`Roles` and 
         select your role.
      #. In the :guilabel:`permissions` tab, add a new "inline permission" to 
         allow this role to invoke your lambda(s). The example ``permission-policy.json`` 
         provided above adds the permission to run any lambda with the name ``<function-name>``.
      #. Finally, navigate to your {+atlas-sp+} Instance, add a new :guilabel:`AWS Lambda connection` 
         and choose the :guilabel:`AWS IAM Role ARN` that you configured in the previous step.

Connect your {+atlas-sp+} Instance to your AWS Lambda Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to send a request to your AWS Lambda resource from within your {+atlas-sp+} 
pipeline, you must first add your AWS Lambda resource as a :ref:`connection <atlas-sp-manage-connections>` 
in your {+atlas-sp+} resource. 

You can add your AWS Lambda resource as a connection through the |service| UI, 
the MongoDB Terraform provider, the |service| CLI, or 
the |service| API, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: bash 

   curl --user "username:password" --digest \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --header "Accept: application/vnd.atlas.2023-02-01+json" \
      --include \
      --data '{"name": "TestAWSLambdaConnection","type": "AWSLambda","aws": {"roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::<aws_account>:role/<role_name>"}}' \
      --request POST "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v2/groups/<group_id>/streams/<tenant_name>/connections"

.. note:: 

   You can update the ``roleArn`` placeholder in the above example with the ``arn``
   from your `AWS IAM configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns>`__.

Syntax
~~~~~~

Minimal request
```````````````
The following example shows the required fields for a minimal request.

.. code-block:: json

   { $externalFunction: {
     connectionName: "myLambdaConnection",
     functionName: "arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:function-name",
     as: "response",
   }}

Customized request
```````````````````
The following, customized example specifies error handling, synchronous execution 
and a preprocessed {+atlas-sp+} document as a payload in addition to the required 
fields illustrated above.

.. code-block:: json

   { $externalFunction: {
	   connectionName: "myLambdaConnection",
	   functionName: "arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:function-name",
	   execution: "sync"
	   as: "response",
	   onError: "fail",
	   payload: [{$replaceRoot: { newRoot: "$fullDocument.payloadToSend" } }, { $addFields: { sum: { $sum: "$randomArray" }}}, { $project: { success: 1, sum: 1 }}],
   }}

.. note:: 

   The ``onError`` field defines behavior for API level errors for both 
   synchronous and asynchronous requests to your AWS Lambda resource as well as 
   AWS Lambda function errors for synchronous requests.

The ``$externalFunction`` stage takes a document with the following fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 15 15 45

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description

   * - ``connectionName`` 
     - string
     - Required
     - Label that identifies the connection in the
       :ref:`Connection Registry <atlas-sp-manage-connections>`, to which
       the request is sent.

   * - ``functionName``
     - string
     - Required
     - The full AWS ARN or the name of the AWS Lambda function to be triggered. 

   * - ``execution``
     - enum
     - Optional 
     - Parameter that specifies whether the AWS Lambda function should be called 
       synchronously or asynchronously. Accepted values are:
       
       - ``sync``
       - ``async`` 

       Defaults to ``sync``, which is required if remaining stages in your 
       {+atlas-sp+} pipeline require the output from your AWS Lambda function.

   * - ``as``
     - string
     - Optional
     - Name of the field for the REST API response.

       If the endpoint returns 0 bytes, the operator doesn't set the ``as`` field.

   * - ``onError``
     - string
     - Optional
     - Behavior when the operator encounters an  ``HTTPS Status Code`` or Lambda Runtime-related
       failure. Must be one of the following values:

       - ``"dlq"`` : Pass the affected document to the :term:`dead letter queue`.
       - ``"ignore"`` : Do nothing with the affected document.
       - ``"fail"`` : Terminate the stream processor on error.

       ``onError`` does not trigger on errors arising from incorrect
       configuration of the ``$externalFunction`` operator itself, such as invalid 
       expressions.

       Defaults to ``"dlq"``.

   * - ``payload``
     - array
     - Optional
     - Custom inner pipeline that allows you to customize the request body sent to the API endpoint. 
       ``payload`` supports the following expressions:

       - ``$project``
       - ``$addFields``
       - ``$replaceRoot``
       - ``$set``
