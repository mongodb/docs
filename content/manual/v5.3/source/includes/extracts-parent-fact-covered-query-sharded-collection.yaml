  .. FYI -- we doc this in the negative since this is included
  .. in the limitation/restriction section.
  .. We probably could word this in "can only cover ..."
  .. to make it more positive.

  Starting in MongoDB 3.0, an index cannot {{cover}} a query on a
  :term:`sharded <shard>` collection when run against a
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` if the index does not contain the shard key,
  with the following exception for the ``_id`` index: If a query on a
  sharded collection only specifies a condition on the ``_id`` field
  and returns only the ``_id`` field, the ``_id`` index can cover the
  query when run against a :binary:`~bin.mongos` even if the ``_id``
  field is not the shard key.

  In previous versions, an index cannot :ref:`cover <covered-queries>`
  a query on a :term:`sharded <shard>` collection when run against a
  :binary:`~bin.mongos`.
