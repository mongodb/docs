Charts provide visual representations of the data in your
:ref:`data source <data-sources>`. A chart maps to a *single*
data source, and it can display correlations between several fields in the
data. Charts reside inside :doc:`dashboards </dashboards>`. Unless
you create a chart :ref:`from the Atlas UI <create-new-chart>`, 
you must create a dashboard before you can begin building
charts.

For a complete list of available chart types and how to build specific
charts, refer to the :ref:`Chart Types <chart-type-reference>` page.

.. _create-new-chart:

Create a Chart
--------------

You can create a chart from the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page 
in |charts-short| or from the {+atlas-ui+}.

.. note::

   If the preview for a chart of the full dataset takes a while to 
   load, you can :ref:`preview a subset of the data 
   <charts-subset-mode>` with the :guilabel:`Subset` toggle.
