.. dbcommand:: fsync

   The :dbcommand:`fsync` command forces the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process
   to flush all pending writes to the storage layer. :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   is always writing data to the storage layer as applications write
   more data to the database. MongoDB guarantees that it will write
   all data to disk within the :setting:`syncdelay` interval, which is
   60 seconds by default.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { fsync: 1 }

   The :dbcommand:`fsync` operation is synchronous by default, to run
   :dbcommand:`fsync` asynchronously, use the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { fsync: 1, async: true }

   The connection will return immediately. You can check the output of
   :method:`db.currentOp()` for the status of the :dbcommand:`fsync`
   operation.

   The primary use of :dbcommand:`fsync` is to lock the database
   during backup operations. This will flush all data to the data
   storage layer and block all write operations until you unlock the
   database. Consider the following command form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { fsync: 1, lock: true }

   .. note::

      You may continue to perform read operations on a database that
      has a :dbcommand:`fsync` lock. However, following the first
      write operation all subsequent read operations wait until
      you unlock the database.

   To check on the current state of the fsync lock, use
   :method:`db.currentOp()`. Use the following JavaScript function in
   the shell to test if the database is currently locked:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      serverIsLocked = function () {
                           var co = db.currentOp();
                           if (co && co.fsyncLock) {
                               return true;
                           }
                           return false;
                       }

   After loading this function into your :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
   session you can call it as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      serverIsLocked()

   This function will return ``true`` if the database is currently
   locked and ``false`` if the database is not locked. To unlock the
   database, make a request for an unlock using the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("admin").$cmd.sys.unlock.findOne();

   .. versionadded:: 1.9.0
      The :method:`db.fsyncLock()` and :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()`
      helpers in the shell.

   In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, you may use the
   :method:`db.fsyncLock()` and :method:`db.fsyncUnlock()` wrappers for
   the :dbcommand:`fsync` lock and unlock process:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.fsyncLock();
      db.fsyncUnlock();

   .. note::

      :dbcommand:`fsync` lock is only possible on individual shards of
      a sharded cluster, not on the entire sharded cluster. To backup an
      entire sharded cluster, please read :ref:`sharded-cluster-backups`.

      If your :binary:`~bin.mongod` has :term:`journaling <journal>`
      enabled, consider using :ref:`another method
      <backup-with-journaling>` to back up your database.
