.. note:: Release Notes Mention Only Releases with Feature Changes

   MongoDB releases {+asql+} drivers and connectors in a continuous deployment 
   manner. This release cadence allows us to continuously improve {+asql+} 
   Interface performance and stability. These release notes capture only those 
   releases that contain direct user feature changes. If a particular {+asql+} 
   release contains only performance and stability improvements, it is not included 
   in these release notes.

*Released July 15, 2025*

- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.4.5.

  ``offline_access`` and only intersect with IdP reported scopes if the 
  set is not empty.

- Updates the Rust driver to version 3.2.4.

*Released June 12, 2025*

  values for ``setFetchSize`` and provides a clear error message.
- Adds |oidc| default scope to support more IdPs configurations (for 
  example, Azure |oidc|).

*Released April 30, 2025*

- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.4.4.

*Released April 9, 2025*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.2.3.

- Updates UUID string representation to the extended json uuid format 
  ``{$uuid : "val"}`` instead of the generic base64 binary data format 
  ``{ "$binary":{"base64": "base64val", "subType": "xx"}``.
  For ``subType 03``, you can use the :manual:`uuidRepresentation 
  </reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.uuidRepresentation>` connection option.

*Released July 8, 2024*

- Introduces |oidc| authentication for the |odbc| driver.
- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.4.1.
- Adds conversion support for ``wlongvarchar`` and ``wvarcchar`` in
  the |odbc| driver.

*Released June 24, 2024*

- Updates the Tableau custom connector (for the MongoDB JDBC driver) to 
  version 1.3.0.

- Adds a checkbox on the |odbc| driver DSN configuration UI to 
  indicate whether to limit the maximum string length to 4000 
  characters. To work with BI tools, like Microsoft SQL Server 
  Linked Server, which can't handle variable length 
  string data with no known maximum length, you must enable this option.
 
*Released April 24, 2024*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.1.2, which now 
  ignores both "true" and "false" ``setAutoCommit``
  values instead of returning an exception when "true".

  (such as ``document`` and ``oid``)
  default mapping from ``SQL_UNKNOWN_TYPE`` to

  Result set columns appear in the order they are listed in the ``SELECT`` query.
  For ``SELECT *``, the result set column order is unchanged. 
- Updates the information returned by ``SQLGetInfo``
  to report all supported date functions, time functions, and join capabilities.
- Removes log level configuration at the DSN and connection level. 
  The log level can now only be set as a driver property.
- Changes the |bson|-to-SQL mapping of ``Decimal128`` from 
  ``SQL_DECIMAL`` to ``SQL_UNKNOWN`` due to
  incompatibilities between ``Decimal128`` and ``SQL_DECIMAL``.

*Released February 23, 2024*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.1.1, which removes
  the SnakeYaml dependency and fixes an issue introduced in version 2.1.0

  was pointing to the incorrect index. The driver now retrieves the data under 
  the correct index or reports an error if there are duplicate column names.
