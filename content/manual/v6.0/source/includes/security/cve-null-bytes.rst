.. important:: Improper neutralization of null bytes may lead to buffer over-reads in MongoDB Server

   In |cve-version-list|, an authorized user may trigger crashes or 
   receive the contents of buffer over-reads of Server memory by 
   issuing specially crafted requests that construct malformed BSON 
   in the MongoDB Server.

   This issue affects MongoDB Server versions:

   - 5.0.0 - 5.0.29
   - 6.0.0 - 6.0.18
   - 7.0.0 - 7.0.14
   - 8.0.0 - 8.0.2
