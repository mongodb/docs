.. note:: 

   Most state transitions happen as the result of an API call. The exceptions 
   are:

   - The transition from ``COMMITTING`` to ``COMMITTED``. For more information,
     see :ref:`Finalizing Sync <c2c-about-finalizing>`.

   - The transition from ``REVERSING`` to ``RUNNING``. For more information,
     see :ref:`Reversing Sync <c2c-about-reversing>`.
