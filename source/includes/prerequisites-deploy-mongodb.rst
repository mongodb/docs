You must have an existing set of servers to which to deploy, and MMS must
have access to the servers.

The servers can exist on your own system or on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
To give MMS access to servers on your system, install the Automation Agent
to each server.

You can use MMS to provision new servers on AWS, as described in
:doc:`/tutorial/add-servers`.
