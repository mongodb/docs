This page contains information on how the App Services schema used by
Atlas Device Sync maps to the SDK object model used by the Atlas Device SDKs.

To learn how to generate these data models, refer to the following pages:

- To generate SDK object models from your App Services schemas, refer to :ref:`Generate SDK Object Models <generate-sdk-object-models>`.
- To generate App Services schemas from Atlas Device SDK client code, refer to
  :ref:`Generate App Services schema from a SDK object model
  <create-schema-from-rom>`.

To learn more about how Device Sync uses these two data models,
refer to the :ref:`Sync Data Model Overview <sync-schema-overview>`.

.. _database-and-collection-name-mapping:

Databases, Collections, and Objects
-----------------------------------

When you configure Device Sync, you :ref:`specify the data source
<sync-config-data-source>` where you want to store data. This data source
may contain multiple databases, and each database may contain multiple
collections.

The :ref:`App Services schema <schemas>` maps your Realm Database object
names to collections in databases in your Device Sync data source. The
``title`` field in an App Services schema maps to the object type name in
Realm Database. Because the ``title`` name determines the mapping between
client objects and the appropriate Atlas collection, this name must be
unique among all schemas in your synced data source.

The ``title`` does not need to match the collection name.

.. example::

   Consider an app with a database named ``Pets``. It may contain multiple
   collections, such as ``Canine`` and ``Feline``. The App Services schema
   for the ``Canine`` collection might resemble :ref:`the example below
   <sync-app-services-schema-dog-example>`, where the ``title`` field of
   the schema is ``Dog``. That would map a Realm Database object called
   ``Dog`` to the ``Canine`` collection in the ``Pets`` database.

   You could not have another schema whose ``title`` was ``Dog`` in the
   same cluster. For example, you could not sync an object with a ``title``
   of ``Dog`` to both a ``Debug`` and a ``Test`` database in the
   same cluster. If you want to sync the same object to different
   collections for app development purposes, you must use different
   data sources - one cluster for development and a different cluster
   for production.

.. _map-realm-to-atlas-with-development-mode:

Mapping with Development Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you :ref:`enable Development Mode <enable-development-mode>` in your
Device Sync configuration, App Services can automatically create collections
and schemas for Realm Database objects that you sync. It creates those
collections in the :ref:`database you specify
<sync-config-database-name>` when you enable Development Mode.

With Development Mode enabled, Sync looks for a collection whose App Services
schema has a ``title`` that matches the name of your Realm Database object
type. This collection could be in any database in your linked data source.
It doesn't have to be in the database you add when you configure
Development Mode.

If there is no corresponding ``title`` in any App Services schema in your
linked data source, App Services creates a new collection for this object
type. This collection is created in the database you specify when you enable
Development Mode. The collection name matches the object's type, and the
corresponding App Services schema has a ``title`` field whose value is the
name of the object type. This creates the mapping between your Realm
Database object and the new collection.

.. example::

   Consider an Atlas cluster with a database named ``Pets``. It contains a
   ``Feline`` collection with existing data.

   In your application code, you define a new ``Dog`` object. You enable
   Development Mode, and specify the ``Pets`` database as the database
   in which to create collections for new object types. When you sync your
   new ``Dog`` object, App Services creates a ``Dog`` collection in the
   ``Pets`` database and creates a schema for it. The ``title`` of the
   object in the schema is ``Dog``.

   If you later add a new ``Person`` object to your application code and
   then sync it, App Services creates a new collection for this
   ``Person`` object in the ``Pets`` database. If you wanted to create a
   collection for the ``Person`` object in a different database, you
   could :ref:`enforce-a-schema` for the ``Person`` object
   in a different database. Or you could disable and re-enable Development
   Mode, and select a different database in which to create new collections.

.. _object-schema:
.. _property-schema:

Mappings
--------

.. _sync-type-name:

Type Name
~~~~~~~~~

The ``title`` field contains the name of the object type represented by
the schema. This is equivalent to a class or schema name in an Atlas Device SDK.
The type name must be unique among all schemas in your synced cluster
but is otherwise arbitrary and does not need to match the collection
name.

A conventional approach is to name each object type with a singular
noun, like "Dog" or "Person". Schemas generated in development mode or
by sampling existing documents use this convention.

.. note::

   To work with Atlas Device Sync, type names cannot exceed {+name-char-limit+} UTF-8 characters.

Property Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the following constraints for a given property:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description

   * - Type
     - String
     - Every property in a SDK object model has a strongly defined data
       type. A property's type can be a primitive data type or an object
       type defined in the same SDK object model. The type also specifies whether
       the property contains a single value or a list of values.

       Realm Database supports the following property types:

       - boolean
       - integer
       - double
       - string
       - date
       - decimal128
       - objectId
       - uuid
       - mixed
       - array
       - object

       For more information on supported data types, refer to :ref:`Schema Types <schema-types>`.

   * - Optional
     - Boolean
     - Optional properties may contain a null value or be entirely
       omitted from an object. By default, all properties are optional
       unless explicitly marked as required.

   * - Default
     - Boolean
     - If a client application creates a new object that does not have a
       value for a defined property, the object uses the default value
       instead.

       If you open a database in the client with a schema subset that doesn't
       include a required property, the server will automatically
       populate the value of the required property with a zero or blank
       default value.

       When you attempt to create an object that is missing a value
       for a required field, it fails validation and does not persist
       to the realm.

   * - Indexed
     - Boolean
     - A property index significantly increases the speed of certain
       read operations at the cost of additional overhead for write
       operations. Indexes are particularly useful for equality
       comparison, such as querying for an object based on the value of
       a property. However, indexes consume additional storage.

For SDK-specific details about data types, refer to the following:

- :ref:`cpp-supported-property-types`
- :ref:`flutter-data-types`
- :ref:`java-data-types`
- :ref:`kotlin-supported-types`
- :ref:`dotnet-field-types`
- :ref:`node-data-types`
- :ref:`react-nativedata-types-field-types`
- :ref:`Supported Property Types - Swift SDK <ios-supported-property-types>`

Array Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both SDK object models and App Services schemas support array properties.

For SDK-specific details about array properties, refer to the following:

- :ref:`cpp-supported-property-types`
- :ref:`Dart Types - Flutter SDK <flutter-dart-types>`
- :ref:`Lists - Java SDK <java-field-relationships-lists>`
- :ref:`kotlin-supported-types`
- :ref:`Lists - .NET SDK <dotnet-property-lists>`
- :ref:`Supported Property Types - Node.js SDK <node-supported-property-types>`
- :ref:`Supported Property Types - React Native SDK <react-native-supported-property-types>`
- :ref:`swift-supported-types`

For more information on modeling array properties in an App Services schema,
refer to :ref:`BSON Types - Array <schema-type-array>`.
App Services schemas support certain constraints that SDK object models do not,
such as specifying the minimum and maximum number of items.

.. _mixed-properties:

Mixed Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both SDK object models and App Services schemas support mixed
type properties.

A mixed field can contain any supported data type and
functionally acts as an object or document without a pre-defined
structure.

For more information on modeling mixed properties in
an App Services schema, refer to :ref:`Mixed - Schema Types <schema-type-mixed>`.

.. _collections-in-mixed:

Collections in Mixed Properties
```````````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/note-collections-in-mixed-sync.rst

You can leverage collections (arrays or dictionaries) in mixed properties to
store data that does not fit into a pre-defined schema, such as variable JSON
data or complex MongoDB documents. Because collections of mixed data can contain
other collections of mixed data, you can nest data into complex structures. For
an example, refer to the :ref:`nested-collections-data-model-example` on this page.

You can store collections in mixed data types in an App Services schema or in an
SDK object model schema.

For SDK-specific details about mixed data types, refer to the following:

- :ref:`Mixed - C++ SDK <cpp-supported-property-types>`
- :ref:`RealmValue - Flutter SDK <flutter-realm-value>`
- :ref:`RealmAny - Java SDK <java-realmany>`
- :ref:`RealmAny - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-realmany>`
- :ref:`RealmValue - .NET SDK <realmvalue>`
- :ref:`Mixed - Node.js SDK <node-data-types-mixed>`
- :ref:`Mixed - React Native <react-nativedata-types-mixed>`
- :ref:`AnyRealmValue - Swift SDK <ios-mixed-data-type>`

.. note:: New Java SDK Apps Cannot Use ``RealmAny``

  New App Services Apps using Java SDK cannot synchronize data models with
  properties of type ``RealmAny``. To use mixed data types with Device Sync
  in your app, use the Kotlin SDK.

Embedded Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Embedded objects are embedded as nested data inside of a parent object.
An embedded object inherits the lifecycle of its parent object.
It cannot exist as an independent database object.

For SDK-specific details about embedded objects, refer to the following:

- :ref:`Define an Embedded Object - C++ SDK <cpp-embedded-object>`
- :ref:`Embedded Objects - Flutter SDK <flutter-embedded-objects>`
- :ref:`Define an Embedded Object Field - Java SDK <java-define-an-embedded-object-property>`
- :ref:`Embedded Objects - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-embedded-objects>`
- :ref:`dotnet-embedded-objects`
- :ref:`Embedded Objects - Node.js SDK <node-embedded-objects>`
- :ref:`Embedded Objects - React Native SDK <react-native-embedded-objects>`
- :ref:`Define an Embedded Object Property - Swift SDK <ios-embedded-objects>`

For more information on modeling to-one relationships in an App Services schema,
refer to :ref:`Embedded Object Relationships <relationships-embedded-object>`.

Sets
~~~~

SDK object models and App Services schemas both support the Set data type.
A set is a collection of unique values.

For SDK-specific details about sets, refer to the following:

- :ref:`Set - C++ SDK <cpp-set-collections>`
- :ref:`RealmSet - Flutter SDK <flutter-realm-set>`
- :ref:`java-realmset`
- :ref:`RealmSet - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-realm-set>`
- :ref:`dotnet-client-sets`
- :ref:`node-data-types-sets`
- :ref:`react-native-data-types-sets`
- :ref:`Mutable Set - Swift SDK <ios-mutableset-data-type>`

For more information on modeling sets in an App Services schema,
refer to :ref:`Set <schema-type-set>`.

Dictionaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~

SDK object models and App Services schemas both support the Dictionary data type.
A set is a collection of unique values.
A dictionary is a collection of dynamic and unique string keys paired with values of a given type.
A dictionary is functionally an object or document without pre-defined field names.

For SDK-specific details about dictionaries, refer to the following:

- :ref:`Map/Dictionary - C++ SDK <cpp-map>`
- :ref:`RealmMap - Flutter SDK <flutter-realm-map>`
- :ref:`java-realmdictionary`
- :ref:`RealmDictionary - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-define-realm-dictionary-type>`
- :ref:`dotnet-client-dictionaries`
- :ref:`node-data-types-dictionaries`
- :ref:`react-native-data-types-dictionaries`
- :ref:`Map/Dictionary - Swift SDK <ios-map>`

For more information on modeling dictionaries in an App Services schema,
refer to :ref:`Dictionary <schema-type-dictionary>`.

Relationships
-------------

SDK object models support the following types of relationships:

- To-one relationships: A to-one relationship means that an object is related
  in a specific way to no more than one other object.
- To-many relationships: A to-many relationship means that an object is related
  in a specific way to multiple objects.
- Inverse relationships: An inverse relationship links an object back
  to any other objects that refer to it in a defined to-one or to-many relationship.

App Services schemas support to-one and to-many relationships.
App Services schemas *do not* support inverse relationships.

For SDK-specific details about relationships, refer to the following:

- :ref:`cpp-relationships`
- :ref:`Define Relationship Properties - Flutter SDK <flutter-client-relationships>`
- :ref:`kotlin-relationships`
- :ref:`Define a Relationship Field - Java SDK <java-relationships>`
- :ref:`dotnet-client-relationships`
- :ref:`Define Relationship Properties - Node.js SDK <node-define-relationship-properties>`
- :ref:`Define Relationship Properties - React Native SDK <react-native-relationships>`
- :ref:`swift-model-relationships`

For more information on modeling relationships in an App Services schema,
refer to :ref:`Relationships <relationships>`.

.. _geospatial-data-modeling:

Geospatial Data
---------------

Geospatial data describes points and other data on the Earth's surface. App
Services does not have built-in geospatial types. Instead, you model geographic
data using standard GeoJSON objects. For more information on geospatial data, refer to :ref:`Schema Types <schema-types>`.

For SDK-specific details about geospatial data, refer to:

- :ref:`Geospatial - Flutter SDK <flutter-data-types-geospatial>`
- :ref:`Geospatial - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-geospatial>`
- :ref:`Geospatial - .NET SDK <dotnet-geospatial>`
- :ref:`Geospatial - Node.js SDK <node-data-types-geospatial>`
- :ref:`Geospatial - React Native SDK <react-native-data-types-geospatial>`
- :ref:`Geospatial - Swift SDK <swift-geospatial-data-type>`

Data Model Mapping Example
--------------------------

This example shows how to model a ``Dog`` with Device Sync.

.. _sync-app-services-schema-dog-example:

App Services Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This App Services schema creates the ``Dog`` data model used by Device Sync.

.. code-block:: json
   :caption: Dog data model defined in App Services schema

   {
     "title": "Dog",
     "bsonType": "object",
     "required": [
       "_id",
       "name"
     ],
     "properties": {
       "_id": {
         "bsonType": "objectId"
       },
       "name": {
         "bsonType": "string"
       },
       "age": {
         "bsonType": "int"
       }
       "breed": {
         "bsonType": "string"
       }
       "details": {
         "bsonType": "mixed"
       }
     }
   }

SDK object model

Data in Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An application using Device Sync for the ``Dog`` data model creates MongoDB documents
in Atlas based on the previous schemas.

Example Document
````````````````

.. code-block:: js
   :caption: Dog document created in Atlas

   {
     "_id": ObjectId('616f44305a205add93ff1081'),

     "details": null
   }

.. _nested-collections-data-model-example:

Example Document: Nested Collections of Mixed Data
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

Nested collections of mixed data are dictionaries or arrays stored in a mixed
data type. This can resemble the following example:

.. code-block:: js

   {
     "_id": ObjectId('616f44305a205add93ff1081'),
