Synopsis
--------

:program:`mongosniff` provides a low-level operation tracing/sniffing view
into database activity in real time. Think of :program:`mongosniff` as a
MongoDB-specific analogue of ``tcpdump`` for TCP/IP network
traffic. :program:`mongosniff` is most frequently used in driver
development.

.. _mongosniff-libcap:

.. note::

   :program:`mongosniff` requires ``libpcap`` and is only available for
   Unix-like systems.

As an alternative to :program:`mongosniff`, Wireshark, a popular
network sniffing tool is capable of inspecting and parsing the MongoDB
wire protocol.

Use
---

Use the following command to connect to a :program:`mongod` or
:program:`mongos` running on port 27017 *and* 27018 on the localhost
interface:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongosniff --source NET lo 27017 27018

Use the following command to only log invalid :term:`BSON` objects for
the :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` running on the localhost
interface and port 27018, for driver development and troubleshooting:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongosniff --objcheck --source NET lo 27018
