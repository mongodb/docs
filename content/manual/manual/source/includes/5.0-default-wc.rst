Starting in MongoDB 5.0, the implicit default
:ref:`write concern <write-concern>` is
:writeconcern:`w: majority <"majority">`. However, special
considerations are made for deployments containing
:ref:`arbiters <replica-set-arbiter-configuration>`:

- The voting majority of a replica set is 1 plus half the number of
  voting members, rounded down. If the number of data-bearing voting
  members is not greater than the voting majority, the default write
  concern is ``{ w: 1 }``.

- In all other scenarios, the default write concern is ``{ w:
  "majority" }``.

Specifically, MongoDB uses the following formula to determine the
default write concern:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   if [ (#arbiters > 0) AND (#non-arbiters <= majority(#voting-nodes)) ]
       defaultWriteConcern = { w: 1 }
   else
       defaultWriteConcern = { w: "majority" }

For example, consider the following deployments and their respective
default write concerns:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Non-Arbiters
     - Arbiters
     - Voting Nodes
     - Majority of Voting Nodes
     - Implicit Default Write Concern

   * - 2
     - 1
     - 3
     - 2
     - ``{ w: 1 }``

   * - 4
     - 1
     - 5
     - 3
     - ``{ w: "majority" }``

- In the first example:

  - There are 2 non-arbiters and 1 arbiter for a total of 3 voting
    nodes.
    
  - The majority of voting nodes (1 plus half of 3, rounded
    down) is 2.
    
  - The number of non-arbiters (2) is equal to
    the majority of voting nodes (2), resulting in an implicit write
    concern of ``{ w: 1 }``.

- In the second example:

  - There are 4 non-arbiters and 1 arbiter for a total of 5
    voting nodes.
    
  - The majority of voting nodes (1 plus half of 5, rounded
    down) is 3.
    
  - The number of non-arbiters (4) is greater than the majority
    of voting nodes (3), resulting in an implicit write concern of
    ``{ w: "majority" }``.
