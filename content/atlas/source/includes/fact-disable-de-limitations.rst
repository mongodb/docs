When :guilabel:`Data Explorer` is disabled, you cannot:

- Terminate slow operations from the
  :ref:`Real-Time Performance Panel <real-time-metrics-status-tab>`.

- Create indexes from the
  :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>`. You
  can still view Performance Advisor recommendations, but you must
  create those indexes from {+mongosh+}.

- Use the :ref:`Search Tester <atlas-search-queries>` to run Search queries.
  You can still run Search queries using {+mongosh+}, {+Compass+}, or
  :driver:`MongoDB drivers </>`.
