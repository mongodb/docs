You can use connection strings to define connections between
MongoDB instances and the following destinations:

- Your applications when you connect using :driver:`drivers </>`.
- Tools such as :compass:`MongoDB Compass </>` and 
  :mongosh:`the MongoDB Shell (mongosh) </>`.

Complete these steps to find your connection string.

Find Your {+atlas+} Connection String
-----------------------------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Atlas CLI 
      :tabid: atlas-cli

      To find your {+atlas+} connection string using the
      :atlascli:`Atlas CLI </>`, :atlascli:`install 
      </install-atlas-cli/>` and :atlascli:`connect
      </connect-atlas-cli/>` from the Atlas CLI, then run the following
      command. Replace ``<clusterName>`` with the name of the {+atlas+}
      cluster and replace ``<projectId>`` with the project ID.

      .. code-block::

         atlas clusters connectionStrings describe <clusterName> --projectId <projectId>

      To learn more, see :atlascli:`atlas clusters connectionStrings describe
      </command/atlas-clusters-connectionStrings-describe/>`.

   .. tab:: Atlas UI 
      :tabid: atlas-ui

      To find your {+atlas+} connection string in the Atlas UI,
      follow these steps:

      .. include:: /includes/steps-find-atlas-connection-string.rst

Your {+atlas+} connection string resembles the following 
example:

.. include:: /includes/connection-examples-by-language-atlas.rst

Find Your Self-Hosted Deployment's Connection String
----------------------------------------------------

If you are connected to your self-hosted MongoDB Enterprise or
MongoDB Community deployment, run :method:`db.getMongo()` method to
return the connection string.

If you are not connected to your deployment, you can
determine your connection string based on the connection type you
want to use. See :ref:`connections-dns-seedlist` to learn the SRV
connection string syntax or
:ref:`connections-standard-connection-string-format` to learn the
standard connection string syntax.

Your self-hosted connection string resembles the following
examples:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: SRV Connection String
      :tabid: srv

      .. include:: /includes/srv-connection-examples-onprem.rst

   .. tab:: Standard Connection String
      :tabid: standard

      .. include:: /includes/standard-connection-examples-onprem.rst
