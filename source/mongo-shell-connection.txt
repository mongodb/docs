The :guilabel:`Connect` dialog box for a {+database-deployment+} provides 
the details to connect to a {+database-deployment+} via the MongoDB 
shell, {+mongosh+}.

Prerequisites
-------------

|tls|
~~~~~

Clients must support |tls| to connect to an |service| {+database-deployment+}.

Clients must support the :rfc:`SNI <6066#section-3>` |tls| extension to
connect to an |service| ``M0`` {+free-cluster+} or an ``M2/M5``
{+shared-cluster+}. MongoDB 4.0 and later shell supports the |sni| |tls|
extension.
