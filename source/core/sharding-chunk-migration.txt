=============================
Chunk Migration Across Shards
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Chunk migration moves the chunks of a sharded collection from one shard
to another and is part of the :doc:`balancer
</core/sharding-balancing>` process.

Chunk Migration
---------------

MongoDB migrates chunks in a :term:`sharded cluster` to distribute the
chunks of a sharded collection evenly among shards. Migrations may be
either:

- Manual. Only use manual migration in limited cases, such as
  to distribute data during bulk inserts. See :doc:`Migrating Chunks
  Manually </tutorial/migrate-chunks-in-sharded-cluster>` for more details.

- Automatic. The :doc:`balancer </core/sharding-balancing>` process
  automatically migrates chunks when there is an uneven distribution of
  a sharded collection's chunks across the shards. See :ref:`Migration
  Thresholds <sharding-migration-thresholds>` for more details.

All chunk migrations use the following procedure:

#. The balancer process sends the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command to
   the source shard.

#. The source starts the move with an internal :dbcommand:`moveChunk`
   command. During the migration process, operations to the chunk
   route to the source shard. The source shard is responsible for
   incoming write operations for the chunk.

#. The destination shard begins requesting documents in the chunk and
   starts receiving copies of the data.

#. After receiving the final document in the chunk, the destination
   shard starts a synchronization process to ensure that it has the
   changes to the migrated documents that occurred during the migration.

#. When fully synchronized, the destination shard connects to the
   :term:`config database` and updates the cluster metadata with the new
   location for the chunk.

#. After the destination shard completes the update of the metadata,
   and once there are no open cursors on the chunk, the source shard
   deletes its copy of the documents.

      If the balancer needs to perform additional chunk migrations from
      the source shard, the balancer can start the next chunk
      migration without waiting for the current
      migration process to finish this deletion step. See
      :ref:`chunk-migration-queuing`.

The migration process ensures consistency and maximizes the availability of
chunks during balancing.

.. _chunk-migration-queuing:

Chunk Migration Queuing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 2.4

To migrate multiple chunks from a shard, the balancer migrates the
chunks one at a time. However, the balancer does not wait for the
current migration's delete phase to complete before starting the next
chunk migration. See :ref:`sharding-chunk-migration` for the chunk
migration process and the delete phase.

This queuing behavior allows shards to unload chunks more quickly in
cases of heavily imbalanced cluster, such as when performing initial
data loads without pre-splitting and when adding new shards.

This behavior also affect the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command, and
migration scripts that use the :dbcommand:`moveChunk` command may
proceed more quickly.

In some cases, the delete phases may persist longer. If multiple delete
phases are queued but not yet complete, a crash of the replica set's
primary can orphan data from multiple migrations.

.. _chunk-migration-replication:

Chunk Migration and Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, each document move during chunk migration propagates to at
least one secondary before the balancer proceeds with its next
operation.

To override this behavior and allow the balancer to continue before
replicating to a secondary, set the ``_secondaryThrottle`` parameter to
``false``. See :ref:`sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle` to
update the ``_secondaryThrottle`` parameter for the balancer.

Independent of the ``secondaryThrottle`` setting, certain operations of
the chunk migration have the following replication policy:

- MongoDB briefly pauses all application writes to the source shard
  before updating the config servers with the new location for the
  chunk, and resumes the application writes after the update. The
  chunk commit requires all writes to be durably replicated to a
  majority of servers in order to proceed and finish.

- When an outgoing chunk migration finishes and cleanup occurs, all
  writes must be replicated to a majority of servers before further
  cleanup (from other outgoing migrations) or new incoming migrations
  can proceed.

.. versionchanged:: 2.4

   In previous versions, the balancer did not wait for the document
   move to replicate to a secondary. For details, see :v2.2:`Secondary
   Throttle in the v2.2 Manual
   </tutorial/configure-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle>`
