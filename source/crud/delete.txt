Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+driver-short+} to remove
documents from a MongoDB collection by performing delete operations.

A delete operation removes one or more documents from a MongoDB collection.
You can perform a delete operation by using the ``delete_one()`` or
``delete_many()`` methods.

.. .. tip:: Interactive Lab

..    This page includes a short interactive lab that demonstrates how to
..    modify data by using the ``delete_many()`` method. You can complete this
..    lab directly in your browser window without installing MongoDB or a code editor.

..    To start the lab, click the :guilabel:`Open Interactive Tutorial` button at the
..    top of the page. To expand the lab to a full-screen format, click the
..    full-screen button (:guilabel:`⛶`) in the top-right corner of the lab pane.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:ref:`<pymongo-get-started>` tutorial.

Delete Operations
-----------------

You can perform delete operations in MongoDB by using the following methods:

- ``delete_one()``, which deletes *the first document* that matches the search criteria
- ``delete_many()``, which deletes *all documents* that match the search criteria

Each delete method requires a **query filter** document, which specifies the
search criteria that determine which documents to select for removal.
For more information about query filters, see the 
:manual:`Query Filter Documents section </core/document/#query-filter-documents>` in
the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Delete One Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``delete_one()`` method to remove a document in
the ``restaurants`` collection with a ``name`` value of ``"Ready Penny Inn"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/delete.py
   :start-after: start-delete-one
   :end-before: end-delete-one
   :language: python
   :copyable:

Delete Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``delete_many()`` method to remove all documents
in the ``restaurants`` collection with a ``borough`` value of ``"Brooklyn"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/delete.py
   :start-after: start-delete-many
   :end-before: end-delete-many
   :language: python
   :copyable:

Customize the Delete Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``delete_one()`` and ``delete_many()`` methods optionally accept additional
parameters, which represent options you can use to configure the delete
operation. If you don't specify any additional options, the driver does not customize
the delete operation.

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``collation``
     - | Specifies the kind of language collation to use when sorting
         results. See :ref:`pymongo-delete-collation` for more information.

   * - ``hint``
     - | Gets or sets the index to scan for documents. 
         For more information, see the :manual:`hint statement </reference/command/delete/#std-label-deletes-array-hint>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``session``
     - | An instance of ``ClientSession``.

   * - ``let``
     - | A map of parameter names and values. Values must be constant or closed
         expressions that don't reference document fields. For more information,
         see the :manual:`let statement
         </reference/command/delete/#std-label-delete-let-syntax>` in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``comment``
     - | A comment to attach to the operation. For more information, see the :manual:`delete command
         fields </reference/command/delete/#command-fields>` guide in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual for more information.

The following code uses the ``delete_many()`` method to delete all documents in
the ``restaurants`` collection with a ``name`` value that includes the string ``"Mongo"``.
It also uses the ``comment`` option to add a comment to the operation:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/delete.py
   :start-after: start-delete-options
   :end-before: end-delete-options
   :language: python
   :copyable:

.. tip::

   If the preceding example used the ``delete_one()`` method instead of
   ``delete_many()``, the driver would delete only the first document with a
   ``name`` value that includes ``"Mongo"``.

.. _pymongo-delete-collation:

Collation
`````````

When you perform a delete operation, you can specify a **collation** for the driver to
use.

.. include:: /includes/collation-description.rst

The following example performs the same delete operation as the previous example,
but with a default collation of ``fr_CA``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/delete.py
   :start-after: start-delete-many-collation
   :end-before: end-delete-many-collation
   :language: python
   :copyable:

.. include:: /includes/collation-override-note.rst

Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``delete_one()`` and ``delete_many()`` methods return a
``DeleteResult`` type. This type contains the following properties:

- ``deleted_count``, which indicates the number of documents deleted
- ``acknowledged``, which indicates if the server acknowledges the result
- ``raw_result``, which is the raw result returned by the server

.. note::

   If the ``acknowledged`` attribute is ``False``, all other attributes of ``DeleteResult``
   raise an ``InvalidOperation`` exception when accessed. The driver cannot
   determine these values if the server does not acknowledge the write operation.

If the query filter does not match any documents, the driver doesn't delete any
documents and ``deleted_count`` is 0.
