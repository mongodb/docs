  Test your PyMongo installation to ensure you can
  successfully connect to your cluster.

  a. Run the following command to open the Python shell:

     .. code-block:: shell
   
        python

  #. Import PyMongo by running the following command in the Python
     shell:

     .. code-block:: python

        import pymongo

  #. Check your PyMongo version using the following command:
