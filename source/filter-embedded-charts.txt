You can customize your embedded charts by adding:

- Pre-filters. Use the ``preFilter`` option with the |charts-short| Embedding SDK 
  or append various query parameters to your iframe URLs.

- Filters. Use the ``filter`` option with the |charts-short| Embedding SDK or
  append various query parameters to your iframe URLs.

You can use both pre-filters and filters in the same dashboard, even though
using them is optional. If specified, pre-filters always run after the
chart views and before the dashboard's queries and filters.

.. note::

   To embed charts from your dashboards, you must configure embedding
   options on your data sources. For instructions, see:
   
   - :ref:`embedding-charts`

   You can filter embedded charts and charts on 
   :ref:`embedded dashboards <embedding-dashboards>`.

.. _specify-filter-fields:

Specify Filterable Fields
-------------------------

A chart :ref:`Author <dashboard-roles>` specifies the fields that can be
included in pre-filters and filters set by the embedding application code
or added by chart viewers. A chart author can limit access to data by allowing only 
certain fields to be pre-filtered or filtered. By default, no fields are allowed, 
meaning the chart cannot be pre-filtered or filtered until you explicitly allow at 
least one field.

To define filterable fields for pre-filters and filters:

1. Navigate to the :ref:`dashboard <dashboards>` that contains the chart
   where you wish to define filterable fields.

#. For the desired chart, click the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` button and
   select :guilabel:`Embed Chart` from the dropdown.

#. In the :guilabel:`Allowed filter fields` section, use the
   dropdown to select which fields chart viewers can use filter data
   in the chart. You can also manually type values to add fields not
   listed in the dropdown.

   .. note::

      This option only appears if you already have **Unauthenticated** 
      or **Authenticated** embedding access enabled.

   To specify on which fields chart viewers can pre-filter or filter
   data, you can:

   - Use the dropdown to select the fields.
   - Manually type values to add fields not listed in the dropdown.
   - Select :guilabel:`Allow all fields in the data source used in
     this chart`.

#. When you have selected all desired fields, click :guilabel:`Save`
   below the dropdown.

Chart :ref:`viewers <dashboard-roles>` and applications which render
the chart can now use pre-filters and filters based on the specified fields to
display subsets of the original chart data. If a viewer attempts to
use a filter for a field not included in the :ref:`Allowed filter fields
<specify-filter-fields>` list, |charts| returns an :ref:`error <embedded-errors>`.

Specify Filterable Sub-Fields for Fields with Embedded Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you add a field to the :guilabel:`Allowed filter fields` list 
whose value is an embedded document, you must also specify each 
individual sub-field you want to allow.

.. example::

  Consider the following document:

  .. code-block:: json

      {
        "name": "Alice",
        "favorites" : 
        {
          "color": "green",
          "animal": "turtle",
          "season": "autumn"
        } 
      }

  If you only add the ``favorites`` field to the list of allowed fields, it does
  *not* grant viewers permission to filter upon any of the sub-fields
  of ``favorites``. Instead, you may add one or more of the sub-fields
  to the list individually by specifying ``favorites.color``,
  ``favorites.animal``, or ``favorites.season``.

.. _embed-options-pre-filter:

Pre-Filter Data on Charts Embedded in an iframe
------------------------------------------------

Use pre-filters for embedded charts and dashboards with large numbers of collections.
Pre-filters run at an earlier stage in the embedded chart's pipeline and allow you
to do the following:

- Filter the data early, to reduce the query running time.
- Apply filters before the query execution for chart queries that contain aggregations.

Pre-filters behave exactly as filters and use the same syntax. Their only
difference is that they run after the chart views and before the start of the charts queries and filters.
To learn more about the order of pipeline segments, see :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline-generation>`.

Use the ``preFilter`` query parameter to filter data before the chart query
starts running, for the chart embedded in an iframe.

You can specify an MQL document as your ``preFilter`` query parameter provided
that the fields used in your filter are in the :ref:`list of allowed filterable fields <specify-filter-fields>`.

.. _pre-filter-example:

Pre-Filter Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example illustrates how chart views, queries in the query bar,
filters, and pre-filters work together.

Consider the following scenario:

- Charts View contains: 

  .. code-block:: none

     [ { $project: { accommodates: 1, "bedrooms": 1, "address.country": 1 } } ]

- Query bar contains:

  .. code-block:: none

     [ { $match: { accommodates: { $gte: 3 } } }, { $project: { address: 0 } } ]

- The filter in an embedded chart contains:
  
  .. code-block:: none

     { "bedrooms": { $lte: 3 } }

- The pre-filter in an embedded chart contains:

  .. code-block:: none
  
     { "address.country": "Australia" }

In the previous example, before the chart's query starts to run,
the pre-filter is applied, to only look for apartments in Australia.
After that, the chart's query runs, to identify all apartments that
accommodate more than three people.

.. _embed-options-filter:

Filter Data on Charts Embedded in an iframe
-------------------------------------------

Use the ``filter`` query parameter to only display data that matches a 
specified :abbr:`MQL (MongoDB Query Language)` filter in your
chart embedded in an iframe. 

You can use the ``filter`` query parameter on both 
:guilabel:`Unauthenticated`
and :guilabel:`Verified Signature` charts. The filtering
behavior differs with each authentication setting:

- With unauthenticated charts, the chart
  :ref:`Author <dashboard-roles>` specifies the fields that can be
  included in filters set by the embedding application code or added by
  chart viewers. To learn how to specify filterable fields, see
  :ref:`Specify Filterable Fields <specify-filter-fields>`.

- With charts which require a Verified Signature, all document
  fields can be filtered upon, however you must generate
  the filter in the server-side code and include the filter as part of
  your signed payload.

Filter Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select the appropriate tab to see an example of how to filter data in
an :guilabel:`Unauthenticated` chart and a 
:guilabel:`Verified Signature` chart:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: unauthenticated
       name: Unauthenticated External Sharing
       content: |

         You can specify an MQL document as your ``filter`` query
         parameter provided that the fields used in your filter are in
         the :ref:`list of allowed filterable fields <specify-filter-fields>`.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-embedded-filter-examples-unauth.rst

         .. note::

            You must URL-encode special characters of the filter
            parameter.

         Example
         ```````

         The following iframe ``src`` URL renders a chart which only
         displays documents with an ``imdb.rating`` greater than or
         equal to ``8``:

         .. code-block:: none
            :emphasize-lines: 3

            https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-atlasproject1-piocy/embed/charts?
            id=93584ddb-1115-4a12-afd9-5129e47bbb0d&
            filter={"imdb.rating":%20{$gte:%208}}&
            autoRefresh=60

         The URL uses an encoded ``filter`` parameter of
         ``{"imdb.rating":%20{$gte:%208}}``. Decoded,
         this filter is:

         .. code-block:: json

            {"imdb.rating": {$gte: 8}}

     - id: verified-signature
       name: Verified Signature Required
       content: |

         Specify an MQL document as your ``filter`` query parameter.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-embedded-filter-examples-verified.rst

         When using filters in a Verified Signature, MQL queries contain
         characters that must be URL-encoded before your server-side
         code calculates the signature. When |charts-short| verifies the
         signature, it URL-encodes the filter again using the JavaScript
         `encodeURIComponent
         <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent>`__
         function. You must use the same encoding algorithm to encode
         your filter.

         .. important::

            You must encode spaces in your filter as ``%20``, rather than ``+``
            or a raw space.

         To see how correctly encode an MQL filter using different server-side
         programming languages, see `Atlas Charts Embedding Examples
         <https://github.com/mongodb/charts-embedding-examples>`__ on GitHub.

         Example
         ```````

         The following iframe ``src`` URL renders a chart which only
         displays documents with an ``imdb.rating`` greater than or
         equal to ``8``:

         .. code-block:: none
            :emphasize-lines: 5

            https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-atlasproject1-piocy/embed/charts?
            id=93584ddb-1115-4a12-afd9-5129e47bbb0d&
            timestamp=1564156636&
            expires-in=300&
            filter=%7B%22imdb.rating%22%3A%20%7B%24gte%3A%208%7D%7D&
            autoRefresh=60&
            signature=8e0d92b33934c928f6c6974e2f0102ace77f56d851cb0d33893e84c359ab1043

         The URL uses an encoded ``filter`` parameter of
         ``%7B%22imdb.rating%22%3A%20%7B%24gte%3A%208%7D%7D``. Decoded,
         this filter is:

         .. code-block:: json

            {"imdb.rating": {$gte: 8}}

.. _pre-filter-embedded-sdk:

Pre-Filter Data on Charts Embedded with the SDK
------------------------------------------------

You can add a :ref:`preFilter <embed-options-pre-filter>` to an embedded chart
with the ``preFilter`` option. Pre-filtering allows the chart author to run
a filter after the chart views and before the chart query execution and chart's
filters.

In the :guilabel:`Embed Chart` modal, you must specify fields you want to
include in the pre-filter. The :guilabel:`Embed Chart` modal contains a
dropdown menu of fields on which to allow filtering.

The following uses the ``preFilter`` option to represent only documents
in Australia:

.. code-block:: javascript

   createChart({
     baseUrl: '<your-base-url>',
     chartId: '<your-chart-id>',
     width: 500,
     height: 500,
     preFilter: { "address.country": "Australia" }
   })

.. _filter-embedded-sdk:

Filter Data on Charts Embedded with the SDK
-------------------------------------------

You can add a :ref:`filter <embed-options-filter>` to an embedded chart
with the ``filter`` option. Filtering allows the chart author to only display
data in the embedded chart which matches a specified :abbr:`MQL (MongoDB
Query Language)` filter.

In the :guilabel:`Embed Chart` modal, you must specify fields you want
to include in the filter. The :guilabel:`Embed Chart` modal contains a
dropdown menu of fields on which to allow filtering.

The following uses the ``filter`` option to represent only documents in
which the ``total`` field is greater than ``100``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   createChart({
     baseUrl: '<your-base-url>',
     chartId: '<your-chart-id>',
     width: 500,
     height: 500,
     filter: { "total": { "$gt": 100 } }
   })

.. _inject-filter-per-user:

Inject User-Specific Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you embed a chart that requires :guilabel:`Authenticated` access, 
you can use the :guilabel:`Injected function` setting to inject a 
MongoDB filter document specific to each user who views 
the chart. The function has access to your Embedding Authentication 
Provider's token via ``context.token``, and can filter the chart data 
based on the token.

This filter ensures that viewers of an embedded chart see only their
own data, which is useful when embedding charts with potentially
sensitive information.

.. note:: 

   If you use an {+atlas-app-services+} authentication provider, ``context.token`` 
   contains the {+app-services+} 
   :atlas:`user object </app-services/authentication/user-objects/>` to 
   filter. For example, if you enable 
   :atlas:`Custom User Data </app-services/users/enable-custom-user-data/>` 
   for {+app-services+} users, the user object is available in 
   ``context.token.custom_data``.

To inject a filter specific to each user, in the 
:guilabel:`Authenticated` tab of the :guilabel:`Embed Chart`
dialog, set the :guilabel:`Injected function`
setting to :guilabel:`On`. Specify a function and click 
:guilabel:`Save`.
