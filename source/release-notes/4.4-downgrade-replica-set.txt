Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content

Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/downgrade-path.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.4-changes-downgrade-floor.rst

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Access Control
--------------

If your replica set has access control enabled, your downgrade user
privileges must include privileges to list and manage indexes across
databases. A user with :authrole:`root` role has the required
privileges.

Prerequisites
-------------

To downgrade from 4.2 to 4.0, you must remove incompatible features
that are persisted and/or update incompatible configuration settings.

.. |target| replace:: primary

1. Namespace Length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.4:

.. include:: /includes/fact-collection-namespace-limit.rst

Before downgrading, resolve any collections or views with namespaces
that exceed the 120-byte :limit:`Namespace Length` limit for Feature
Compatibility Version (fCV) 4.2.

To determine if you have any collections or views with namespaces
that exceed the 120-byte limit, connect :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
to the |target| and run:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand("listDatabases").databases.forEach(function(d){
      let mdb = db.getSiblingDB(d.name);

      mdb.getCollectionInfos( ).forEach(function(c){
         namespace = d.name + "." + c.name
         namespacelenBytes =  encodeURIComponent(namespace).length

         if (namespacelenBytes > 120) {
            print (c.type.toUpperCase() + " namespace exceeds 120 bytes:: " + namespace )
         }
      } )
   })

If any collection or view namespace exceeds 120 bytes, then :red:`prior` to
downgrading the fCV:

- Rename the collection using the :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command.

- For views, use :method:`db.createView()` to recreate the view
  using a shorter name, then drop the original view.

2. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version (fCV)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip::

   - Ensure that no initial sync is in progress. Running
     :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command while an
     initial sync is in progress will cause the initial sync to restart.

   - Ensure that no replica set member is in :replstate:`ROLLBACK` or
     :replstate:`RECOVERING` state.

   - Downgrading to 
     :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion (fCV) : "4.2" <set-fcv>`
     implicitly performs a :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` to remove the
     :rsconf:`term` field from the configuration document and blocks
     until the new configuration propagates to a majority of replica set
     members.

To downgrade the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of your replica set:

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the |target|.

#. .. include:: /includes/4.4-downgrade-fcv.rst

#. To ensure that all members of the replica set reflect the updated
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, connect to each replica set member and
   check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

   All members should return a result that includes:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      "featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.2" }

   If any member returns a ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of |newfcv|,
   wait for the member to reflect version |oldfcv| before proceeding.

For more information on the returned ``featureCompatibilityVersion``
value, see :ref:`view-fcv`.

3. Remove FCV |newversion| Persisted Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps are necessary only if fCV has ever been set to
|newfcv|.

Remove all persisted |newversion| |features| that are incompatible with
|oldversion|. These include:

Compound Hashed Indexes
  Remove all :ref:`compound hashed indexes 
  <index-type-compound-hashed>`.

  Use :method:`db.collection.getIndexes()` to identify 
  any compound hashed indexes in a collection and use
  :method:`db.collection.dropIndex()` to remove those indexes.

.. |binary| replace:: any replica set member

4. Remove |newversion| Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove all persisted features that use |newversion| features. These
include but are not limited to:

- If any view definitions that include |newversion| operators, such as
  :pipeline:`$unionWith` or :expression:`$function`. See also
  :ref:`4.4-rel-notes-new-agg-operators`.

- :method:`Unhide <db.collection.unhideIndex()>` or :method:`drop
  <db.collection.dropIndex()>` hidden indexes.

Procedure
---------

.. warning::

   Before proceeding with the downgrade procedure, ensure that all
   replica set members, including delayed replica set members, reflect
   the prerequisite changes. That is, check the
   ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` and the removal of incompatible
   features for each node before downgrading.
