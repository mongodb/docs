|service| provides efficient cross-project restores for 
{+database-deployments+} that have {+gcp+} and {+azure+} nodes. If you 
have {+database-deployments+} with {+aws+} nodes created before 
March 27, 2024, you can enable faster cross-project restores.
|service| automatically provides efficient cross-project restores for 
{+database-deployments+} with {+aws+} nodes created after March 
27, 2024.

Considerations
--------------

- The :guilabel:`Faster Restore` button appears only for 
  |service| {+database-deployments+} with {+aws+} nodes created before 
  March 27, 2024. This button doesn't appear for 
  :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas for Government </government>` 
  {+database-deployments+}.

- When you enable faster cross-project restores, |service| replaces 
  each node in your {+database-deployments+} in a rolling fashion 
  during your next maintenance window.

- This replacement might take longer than the defined maintenance 
  window.
  
- Secondary reads and analytic nodes are unavailable during this 
  change.

- When the replacement completes, |service| sends an email confirmation.
