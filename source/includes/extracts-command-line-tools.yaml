   The {{heading}} section of the :guilabel:`Command Line Tools` tab
   displays a copyable template with the minimum required options for
   connecting {{application}} to your |service| cluster. 
   For instructions on finding the :guilabel:`Command Line Tools` tab,
   see :ref:`view-command-line-tools`.

   The template includes placeholder values for certain options.
   You must replace these placeholders with the appropriate values for
   your |service| cluster:

   - ``<PASSWORD>`` - replace this with the password for the user 
     specified in ``--username``. The template includes a MongoDB user
     for the project as the ``--username``. If you want to authenticate 
     as a different user, replace the value of ``--username`` and 
     specify the password for that user in ``--password``.

   Include any other {{application}} command line options as required 
   before copying and pasting the command into your system terminal and 
   executing the full command. See {{application}} for complete 
   documentation on the available command line options and how to use 
   them.

   .. admonition:: Connecting to an |service| cluster from Microsoft Windows
      :class: note

      For users on :abbr:`Windows (Microsoft Windows)`, specify
      {{winapplication}}

      You may need to provide the full file
      path to the {{winapplication}}.
