   :description: encrypt snapshots of your data, access data in encrypted backups, and use KMS from your cloud proviver for additional encryption protection. 

|service| encrypts all snapshots using your cloud provider's standard storage
encryption method, ensuring the security of cluster data at rest.
Your cloud provider manages the encryption keys.

If you use :ref:`security-kms-encryption` for your projects and clusters,
|service| applies an additional layer of encryption to your snapshots using
the Key Management Service (KMS) provider.

View Key Used to Encrypt a Snapshot
------------------------------------

For projects and clusters using :ref:`security-kms-encryption`, |service|
uses the Key Management Service (KMS) provider. 

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: AWS (IAM) KMS
      :tabid: aws-kms

      For clusters using :doc:`AWS IAM </security-aws-kms>` as their
      Key Management Service, |service| uses the project's customer
      master key (CMK) and AWS |iam| user or role credentials at the time
      of the snapshot to automatically encrypt the snapshot data files.
      This is an additional layer of encryption on the existing
      encryption applied to all |service| storage and snapshot
      volumes. :term:`Oplog <oplog>` data collected for |pit| restores
      is also encrypted with the customer's |cmk|.

      |service| stores the unique ID of the |cmk| and the |aws| |iam|
      user credentials or :ref:`roles <set-up-unified-aws-access>` used
      to access the |cmk|. |service| uses this information when restoring
      the snapshot. You can :ref:`access an encrypted snapshot <access-encrypted-snapshot>`
      and :ref:`restore a snapshot using Encryption at Rest <restore-from-ear>`.

   .. tab:: Azure Key Vault
      :tabid: azure-kms

      For clusters using :doc:`Azure Key Vault </security-azure-kms>`
      as their Key Management Service, |service| uses the project's
      Key Identifier, Key Vault Credentials, and Active Directory
      application account credentials at the time of the snapshot to
      automatically encrypt the snapshot data files. This is an
      additional layer of encryption on the existing encryption
      applied to all |service| storage and snapshot volumes.
      :term:`Oplog <oplog>` data collected for |pit| restores
      is also encrypted with the customer's |cmk|.

      |service| stores the unique ID of the Azure Key Identifier used
      the encrypt the snapshot. |service| also stores the Azure Key
      Vault credentials and the Active Domain application account
      credentials used to access the Key Identifier. |service| uses
      this information when restoring the snapshot. You can
      :ref:`access an encrypted snapshot <access-encrypted-snapshot>` and
      :ref:`restore a snapshot using Encryption at Rest <restore-from-ear>`.

   .. tab:: Google Cloud KMS
      :tabid: gcp-kms

      |service| uses your |gcp| Service Account Key to encrypt and
      decrypt your MongoDB master keys. These MongoDB master keys are
      used to encrypt cluster database files and :ref:`cloud providers
      snapshots <backup-cloud-provider>`.
      :term:`Oplog <oplog>` data collected for |pit| restores
      is also encrypted with the customer's |cmk|.
      You can :ref:`access an encrypted snapshot <access-encrypted-snapshot>`
      and :ref:`restore a snapshot using Encryption at Rest <restore-from-ear>`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To view the key used to encrypt a snapshot:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-backup-details.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Snapshots`.
   
   .. step:: Note the :guilabel:`Encryption Key ID`.
      
      Note the :guilabel:`Encryption Key ID` for each snapshot in
      the cluster. |service| lists the Key Identifier used to encrypt the 
      snapshot. Unencrypted snapshots display :guilabel:`Not enabled`, 
      which means that you didn't enable :ref:`security-kms-encryption`. 
      However, |service| encrypts all snapshots and data at rest by 
      default using the default cloud provider key.

.. include:: /includes/fact-encrypted-backups-master-key-requirements.rst

For complete documentation on configuring Encryption at Rest using
your Key Management for an |service| project,
see :ref:`Encryption at Rest using KMS <security-kms-encryption>`.
You can then either :ref:`deploy <create-cluster-enable-encryption>` a
new cluster or :ref:`enable <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>` an existing
cluster with Encryption at Rest using your Key Management.
