.. operator:: $centerSphere

   .. versionadded:: 1.8

   The :operator:`$centerSphere` operator is the spherical equivalent
   of the :operator:`$center` operator. :operator:`$centerSphere` uses
   spherical geometry to define a circle for use by the
   :operator:`$within` operator in :term:`geospatial` queries.

   To define the bounds of a query using :operator:`$centerSphere`, you
   must specify:

   - The center point

   - The angular distance in radians (distance along the surface of the
     earth).

   The following example returns all documents within a 10 mile radius
   of longitude ``88 W`` and latitude ``30 N``. The distance (10 miles)
   is converted to radians by dividing by the approximate radius of the
   earth (3959 miles).

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { loc: { $within: { $centerSphere: [ [88,30], 10 /* miles */ / 3959 /* miles */ ] } } } )
