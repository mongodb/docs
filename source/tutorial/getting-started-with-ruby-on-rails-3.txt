Getting Started with Rails 3
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

It's not difficult to use MongoDB with Rails 3. Most of it comes down
to making sure that you're not loading ActiveRecord and understanding
how to use `Bundler
<http://github.com/carlhuda/bundler/blob/master/README.markdown>`_, the
new Ruby dependency manager.

Install the Rails 3
-------------------

If you haven't done so already, install Rails 3.

.. code-block:: sh

   # Use sudo if your setup requires it
   gem install rails

Configure your application
--------------------------

The important thing here is to avoid loading ActiveRecord. One way to
do this is with the ``--skip-active-record`` switch. So you'd create
your app skeleton like so:

.. code-block:: sh

   rails new my_app --skip-active-record

Alternatively, if you've already created your app (or just want to know
what this actually does), have a look at :file:`config/application.rb` and
change the first lines from this:

.. code-block:: ruby

   require "rails/all"

to this:

.. code-block:: ruby

   require "action_controller/railtie"
   require "action_mailer/railtie"
   require "active_resource/railtie"
   require "rails/test_unit/railtie"

It's also important to make sure that the reference to ``active_record`` in
the generator block is commented out:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Configure generators values. Many other options are available, be sure to check the documentation.
   # config.generators do |g|
   #   g.orm             :active_record
   #   g.template_engine :erb
   #   g.test_framework  :test_unit, :fixture => true
   # end

As of this writing, it's commented out by default, so you probably
won't have to change anything here.

Bundle and Initialize
---------------------

The final step involves bundling any gems you'll need and then creating
an initializer for connecting to the database.

Bundling
--------

Edit :file:`Gemfile`, located in the Rails root directory. By default,
our :file:`Gemfile` will only load Rails:

.. code-block:: ruby
 
   gem "rails", "3.0.0"

Normally, using MongoDB will simply mean adding whichever :ref:`OM framework
<ruby-object-mappers>` you want to work with, as these will require the
"mongo" gem by default.

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Edit this Gemfile to bundle your application's dependencies.

   source 'http://gemcutter.org'

   gem "rails", "3.0.0"
   gem "mongo_mapper"

However, there's currently an issue with loading ``bson_ext``, as the
current gemspec isn't compatible with the way Bundler works. We'll be
fixing that soon; just pay attention to `this issue
<http://jira.mongodb.org/browse/RUBY-95>`_.

In the meantime, you can use the following work-around:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # Edit this Gemfile to bundle your application's dependencies.

   require 'rubygems'
   require 'mongo'
   source 'http://gemcutter.org'

   gem "rails", "3.0.0"
   gem "mongo_mapper"

Requiring ``rubygems`` and ``mongo`` before running the ``gem`` command
will ensure that ``bson_ext`` is loaded. If you'd rather not load
``rubygems``, just make sure that both ``mongo`` and ``bson_ext`` are
in your load path when you require ``mongo``.

Once you've configured your ``Gemfile``, run the bundle installer:

.. code-block:: sh

   bundle install

Initializing
------------

Last item is to create an initializer to connect to MongoDB. Create a
Ruby file in ``config/initializers``. You can give it any name you
want; here we'll call it :file:`config/initializers/mongo.rb`:

.. code-block:: ruby

   MongoMapper.connection = Mongo::Connection.new('localhost', 27017)
   MongoMapper.database = "#myapp-#{Rails.env}"

   if defined?(PhusionPassenger)
     PhusionPassenger.on_event(:starting_worker_process) do |forked|
       MongoMapper.connection.connect if forked
     end
   end

Running Tests
-------------

A slight modification is required to get ``rake test`` working (thanks
to John P. Wood). Create a file :file:`lib/tasks/mongo.rake` containing the
following:

.. code-block:: ruby

   namespace :db do
     namespace :test do
       task :prepare do
         # Stub out for MongoDB
       end
     end
   end

Now the various ``rake test`` tasks will run properly. See `John's post
<http://johnpwood.net/2010/04/13/getting-rake-test-running-with-rails-3-
and-mongodb/>`_ for more details.

Conclusion
----------

That should be all. You can now start creating models based on
whichever OM you've installed.
