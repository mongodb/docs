"A :rsconf:`priority 0 <members[n].priority>` member is a member that "
"**cannot** become :term:`primary` and **cannot** trigger :term:`elections"
" <election>`. Priority 0 members can acknowledge write operations issued "
"with :ref:`write concern <write-concern>` of ``w : <number>``. For "
"``\"majority\"`` write concern, the priority 0 member must also be a "
"voting member (i.e. :rsconf:`members[n].votes` is greater than ``0``) to "
"acknowledge the write. Non-voting replica set members (i.e. "
":rsconf:`members[n].votes` is ``0``) cannot contribute to acknowledging "
