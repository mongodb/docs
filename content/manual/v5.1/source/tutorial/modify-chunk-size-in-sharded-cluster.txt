The default chunk size for a sharded cluster is 64 megabytes. This
default chunk size works well for most deployments; however, if you
notice that automatic migrations have more I/O than your hardware can
handle, you may want to reduce the chunk size. For automatic splits and
migrations, a small chunk size leads to more rapid and frequent
migrations. The allowed range of the chunk size is between 1 and 1024
megabytes, inclusive.

To modify the chunk size, use the following procedure:

#. Connect to any :binary:`~bin.mongos` in the cluster using
   :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

#. Issue the following command to switch to the :ref:`config-database`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config

#. Issue the following command to store the global chunk size
   configuration value:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.settings.insertOne( { _id:"chunksize", value: <sizeInMB> } )

Modifying the chunk size has several limitations:

- Automatic splitting only occurs on insert or update.

- If you lower the chunk size, it may take time for all chunks to split to
  the new size.

- Splits cannot be undone.

- If you increase the chunk size, existing chunks grow only through
  insertion or updates until they reach the new size.

- The allowed range of the chunk size is between 1 and 1024 megabytes,
  inclusive.
