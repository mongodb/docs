`Vercel <https://vercel.com/>`_ is a cloud platform for static frontends
and serverless functions. Applications deployed to Vercel can connect to
|service| clusters using serverless functions that use the
:driver:`MongoDB Node.js driver </node/current/>` or the
`Mongoose ODM library <https://mongoosejs.com/>`_.

Use the following best practices to properly manage connections between
Vercel and |service|. Following these best practices will help you avoid
accumulating connections on the database, preventing you from
potentially exceeding connection limits.

- Define the client to the MongoDB server outside of the handler function
  in its own JavaScript module.

- Don't define a new ``MongoClient`` object each time you invoke your function.
  Doing so causes the :driver:`MongoDB Node.js driver </node/current/>`
  to create a new database connection with each function call. Instead,
  do the following:

  1. Create the ``MongoClient`` object once.
  2. Store the object so that your function can reuse the ``MongoClient`` across
     function invocations and across functions.

  The :ref:`Connection Example <vercel-example>` reuses existing
  database connections to speed up communication with the database
  and keep connection counts to the database at a reasonable level
  with respect to application traffic.

- Use a global variable to hold the ``MongoClient`` object so that in
  development mode it persists across module reloads initiated by
  Vercel's HMR (hot module replacement) capabilities.

.. note::
   It is not possible to determine `the IP addresses of Vercel deployments
   <https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-to-allowlist-deployment-ip-address>`_.
   To connect to |service|, you must add all IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0) to the
   :doc:`IP access list </security/ip-access-list/>` of your |service| cluster.

Connection Example
------------------

In the following Node.js example, the ``index.js`` and ``mongodb-client.js``
files show these best practices:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :caption: index.js
   :linenos:

   "use strict";

   // Import the dependency.
   const clientPromise = require('./mongodb-client');

   // Handler
   module.exports = async (req, res) => {

      // Get the MongoClient by calling await on the promise. Because it is a
      // promise, it will only resolve once.
      const client = await clientPromise;

      // Use the client to return the name of the connected database.
      return client.db().databaseName;
   }


.. code-block:: javascript
   :caption: mongodb-client.js
   :linenos:

   "use strict";

   // Import the dependency.
   const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

   // Use a global variable so that in development mode the value is preserved
   // across module reloads caused by HMR (hot module replacement).
   if (global._mongoClientPromise == null) {
     global._mongoClientPromise = MongoClient.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI,
       { useNewUrlParser: true,  useUnifiedTopology: true });
   }

   // Export a module-scoped promise. By doing this in a separate module, the
   // client can be shared across functions.
   module.exports = global._mongoClientPromise;
