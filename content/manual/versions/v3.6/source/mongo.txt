Introduction
------------

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell is an interactive JavaScript interface to
MongoDB. You can use the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to query and update
data as well as perform administrative operations.

.. include:: /includes/fact-download-mongo-shell.rst

Once you have :doc:`installed and have started MongoDB </installation>`, connect
the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to your running MongoDB instance.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-mongoshell-emulation.rst

Most examples in the :doc:`MongoDB Manual </index>` use the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell; however, many :ecosystem:`drivers
</drivers>` provide similar interfaces to MongoDB.

Start the ``mongo`` Shell
-------------------------

.. important::
   Ensure that MongoDB is running before attempting to start the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

To start the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and connect to your :doc:`MongoDB
</reference/program/mongod>` instance running on **localhost** with
**default port**:

#. At a prompt in a terminal window (or a command prompt for Windows),
   go to your ``<mongodb installation dir>``:

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd <mongodb installation dir>

#. Type ``./bin/mongo`` to start :binary:`~bin.mongo`:

   .. code-block:: sh

      ./bin/mongo

   If you have added the ``<mongodb installation dir>/bin`` to the
   ``PATH`` environment variable, you can just type ``mongo`` instead
   of ``./bin/mongo``.

Options
~~~~~~~

When you run :binary:`~bin.mongo` without any arguments, the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell will attempt to connect to the MongoDB instance
running on the ``localhost`` interface on port ``27017``. To specify a
different host or port number, as well as other options, see
:ref:`examples of starting up mongo <mongo-usage-examples>` and
:doc:`mongo reference </reference/program/mongo>` which provides
details on the available options.

``.mongorc.js`` File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When starting, :binary:`~bin.mongo` checks the user's :envvar:`HOME`
directory for a JavaScript file named :ref:`.mongorc.js
<mongo-mongorc-file>`. If found, :binary:`~bin.mongo` interprets the
content of :file:`.mongorc.js` before displaying the prompt for the
first time. If you use the shell to evaluate a JavaScript file or
expression, either by using the :option:`--eval <mongo --eval>`
option on the command line or by specifying :ref:`a .js file to
mongo <mongo-shell-file>`, :binary:`~bin.mongo` will read the
``.mongorc.js`` file *after* the JavaScript has finished processing.
You can prevent ``.mongorc.js`` from being loaded by using the
:option:`--norc <mongo --norc>` option.

.. _mongo-shell-executing-queries:

Working with the ``mongo`` Shell
--------------------------------

To display the database you are using, type ``db``:

.. code-block:: sh

   db

The operation should return ``test``, which is the default database.
To switch databases, issue the ``use <db>`` helper, as in the
following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use <database>

To list the available databases, use the helper ``show dbs``. See also
:method:`db.getSiblingDB()` method to access a different database from
the current database without switching your current database context
(i.e. ``db``).

You can switch to non-existing databases. When you first store data in
the database, such as by creating a collection, MongoDB creates the
database. For example, the following creates both the database
``myNewDatabase`` and the :term:`collection` ``myCollection`` during
the :method:`~db.collection.insertOne()` operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use myNewDatabase
   db.myCollection.insertOne( { x: 1 } );

The :method:`db.myCollection.insertOne() <db.collection.insertOne()>` is one
of the :doc:`methods available in the mongo shell </reference/method>`.

- ``db`` refers to the current database.

- ``myCollection`` is the name of the collection.

If the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell does not accept the name of a collection,
you can use the alternative :method:`db.getCollection()` syntax.
For instance, if a collection name contains a space or hyphen, starts
with a number, or conflicts with a built-in function:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getCollection("3 test").find()
   db.getCollection("3-test").find()
   db.getCollection("stats").find()

.. include:: /includes/fact-mongo-prompt-size.rst

For more documentation of basic MongoDB operations in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, see:

- :doc:`Getting Started Guide for the mongo Shell
  </tutorial/getting-started>`
- :doc:`/tutorial/insert-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/query-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/update-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/remove-documents`
- :doc:`/reference/method`

Format Printed Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :method:`db.collection.find()` method returns a :term:`cursor` to
the results; however, in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, if the returned
cursor is not assigned to a variable using the ``var`` keyword, then
the cursor is automatically iterated up to 20 times to print up to the
first 20 documents that match the query. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
will prompt ``Type it`` to iterate another 20 times.

To format the printed result, you can add the ``.pretty()`` to the
operation, as in the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.myCollection.find().pretty()

In addition, you can use the following explicit print methods in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

- ``print()`` to print without formatting

- ``print(tojson(<obj>))`` to print with :term:`JSON` formatting and
  equivalent to ``printjson()``

- ``printjson()`` to print with :term:`JSON` formatting and equivalent
  to ``print(tojson(<obj>))``

For more information and examples on cursor handling in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, see :doc:`/tutorial/iterate-a-cursor`. See also
:ref:`mongo-shell-help-cursor` for list of cursor help in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

Multi-line Operations in the ``mongo`` Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you end a line with an open parenthesis (``'('``), an open brace
(``'{'``), or an open bracket (``'['``), then the subsequent lines start
with ellipsis (``"..."``) until you enter the corresponding closing
parenthesis (``')'``), the closing brace (``'}'``) or the closing
bracket (``']'``). The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell waits for the closing
parenthesis, closing brace, or the closing bracket before evaluating
the code, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   > if ( x > 0 ) {
   ... count++;
   ... print (x);
   ... }

You can exit the line continuation mode if you enter two blank
lines, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   > if (x > 0
   ...
   ...
   >

Tab Completion and Other Keyboard Shortcuts
-------------------------------------------

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell supports keyboard shortcuts. For example,

- Use the up/down arrow keys to scroll through command history. See
  :ref:`.dbshell <mongo-dbshell-file>` documentation for more
  information on the ``.dbshell`` file.

- Use ``<Tab>`` to autocomplete or to list the completion
  possibilities, as in the following example which uses ``<Tab>`` to
  complete the method name starting with the letter ``'c'``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.myCollection.c<Tab>

  Because there are many collection methods starting with the letter
  ``'c'``, the ``<Tab>`` will list the various methods that start with
  ``'c'``.

For a full list of the shortcuts, see :ref:`Shell Keyboard Shortcuts
<mongo-keyboard-shortcuts>`

.. _mongo-shell-exit:

Exit the Shell
--------------

To exit the shell, type ``quit()`` or use the ``<Ctrl-C>`` shortcut.
