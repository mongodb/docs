======================
Query MongoDB for Data
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB provides the :method:`db.collection.find()` method in the
:program:`mongo` shell to query a collection. In MongoDB, queries are
scoped to a single collection.

Considerations
--------------

Since the ``_id`` values are generated, when querying, your values
for the ``_id`` field will differ from those displayed on this page.

Prerequisite
------------

The procedures on this page query the ``orders`` collection in the
``test`` database.

Read All Documents in a Collection
----------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/note-id-values-generated.rst

.. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-query-all.rst

Read Documents that Match a Condition
-------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/note-id-values-generated.rst

Queries can specify criteria, or conditions, that determine which
documents to return. Specify the criteria using a document data
structure and pass as a parameter to the :method:`db.collection.find()`
method.

Specify Equality Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The query condition for an equality match on a field has the following
form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { <field>: <value> }

.. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-query-equality.rst

Specify Conditions with Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides various operators to specify query conditions, such as
:method:`comparison operators </reference/operators/query-comparison>`.

Although there are some exceptions, query conditions with operators
generally have the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { <field>: { <operator>: <operand> } }

For a complete list of the operators, see :manual:`query operators
</reference/operator/query>`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-query-operators.rst

Specify Which Fields to Return
------------------------------

A projection document, or *projection*, controls which fields to return
in the matching documents,

In a projection document, or *projection*, specify the field or fields
to return by including the field in the projection with the value
``1``. You can also use a projection document to suppress field or
fields by including the field in the projection with the value ``0``.

A projection document *cannot* contain both suppression and inclusion
specifications with the exception of the ``_id`` field. You can
suppress the ``_id`` field in a projection document that otherwise
specifies inclusion of fields. By default, the ``_id`` field *always
returns* unless explicitly specified in the projection document to
suppress.

Pass the projection document to the :method:`db.collection.find()`
method as the *second* parameter.

.. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-query-projection.rst

Additional Information
----------------------

..
   In addition to the :method:`~cursor.sort()` method, MongoDB provides
   :method:`~cursor.limit()` to limit the number of matching documents to
   return and :method:`~cursor.skip()` that skips the specified number of
   matching documents and returns the rest. For more information on usage
   and examples, see :method:`~cursor.limit()` and
   :method:`~cursor.skip()` .

See the :manual:`Cursor methods </reference/method/js-cursor>` that
allow you to modify a cursor to limit the size of the result set or to
return sorted results. Also consider the reference on the
:manual:`Query and Projection Operators </reference/operator/query>`
that MongoDB provides.
