Modify Custom Roles
-------------------

The following procedure shows how to modify custom roles through the

   displays.

#. Click :icon-fa5:`pencil-alt` :guilabel:`Edit` next to the role you
   want to modify. You can modify the following components of the role:

   - The action(s)/role(s) the custom role inherits.

   - The database(s)/collection(s) on which those privileges
     apply.

#. Click :guilabel:`Update Custom Role` to save the changes.

Delete Custom Roles

Considerations
--------------

- If a :ref:`database user <mongodb-users>` is assigned a custom
  role, they cannot be assigned any other roles. 

- |service| rolls back any role modifications not made through the UI
  or :doc:`API </reference/api/custom-roles>`. You must use the
  |service| UI or API to add, modify, or delete custom roles on
  |service| clusters.
