Overview
--------

.. short-description::

   Retrieve documents in MongoDB with a field-specific query. 

In this guide, you will learn how to index only specified fields in
documents by creating an index with :ref:`static field mappings 
<static-dynamic-mappings>`. This allows you to perform more targeted searches.

.. time:: 5

What You'll Need
----------------

- A MongoDB account. See :ref:`guides-create-atlas-account`.
- An Atlas cluster. See :ref:`guides-create-a-cluster`.
- Sample datasets :ref:`loaded into your cluster <guides-load-sample-data>`.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/navigate_to_cluster.rst

   .. step:: Create a static search index.

      .. procedure::
         :style: connected

         .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Search` tab.

         .. step:: Click 
            :guilabel:`Create Index`.

         .. step:: Select the :guilabel:`Visual Editor` configuration 
            method, then click :guilabel:`Next`.

         .. step:: For the :guilabel:`Index Name`, type ``static``.

         .. step:: For the :guilabel:`Database and Collection`, select the 
            ``sample_supplies`` database and the ``sales`` collection. 
            Then, click :guilabel:`Next`.

         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Refine Your Index` in the bottom 
            left. Then, in the :guilabel:`Index Configurations` pane, 
            toggle off :guilabel:`Dynamic Mapping`.

         .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Field Mappings` pane, click
            :guilabel:`Add Field Mapping`. In the modal window, select 
            ``storeLocation`` from the :guilabel:`Field Name` dropdown 
            menu.

         .. step:: From the :guilabel:`Data Type` dropdown menu, select 
            ``String``. Leave the :guilabel:`Index Configurations` 
            values unchanged, and click :guilabel:`Add` at the bottom 
            of the modal window.

         .. step: Click :guilabel:`Save Changes`, then click 
            :guilabel:`Create Search Index`. Wait for the 
            :guilabel:`Status` column to read :guilabel:`Active`.

            You now have a search index with a static field mapping. 
            This index allows you to focus your search on the 
            ``storeLocation`` field and reduce your computational resource
            requirements by not indexing unused fields.

   .. step:: Run a query on your index.

      .. procedure::
         :style: connected

         .. step:: On the :guilabel:`Search Tester` page, type 
            ``London`` into the search bar, then click 
            :guilabel:`Search`.

         .. step:: Review the results.

            This query returns all documents in the ``sales`` collection with
            a ``storeLocation`` of ``London``. Your results should resemble 
            the following sample documents:

            .. code-block:: json
               :copyable: false

               SCORE: 0.8888952136039734
               salesDate: 2017-12-03T18:39:48.253+00:00
               items: Array
               storeLocation: "London"

               SCORE: 0.8888952136039734
               salesDate: 2015-05-15T13:43:24.561+00:00
               items: Array
               storeLocation: "London"

               SCORE: 0.8888952136039734
               salesDate: 2016-02-06T09:35:02.820+00:00
               items: Array
               storeLocation: "London"

            Each record also includes a :ref:`relevance score <scoring-ref>`.
            You can expand ``Array`` and ``Object`` fields to view their 
            contents by clicking on them.

         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Edit Query Syntax`. The modal window
            displays the query sent through the {+fts+} API.

         .. step:: Type ``online`` into the search bar, then click
            :guilabel:`Search`.

            Even though some records include the string ``online`` in the 
            ``purchaseMethod`` field, no records appear. The index only has 
            a mapping for the ``storeLocation`` field, which means that 
            Atlas Search only returns records with matching values in the 
            ``storeLocation`` field.

Summary
-------

If you successfully completed the procedure in this guide, you have
created an Atlas Search index with a static field mapping and used 
it to perform a targeted relevance-based search. In the next guide,
you will learn how to perform compound searches against specific 
fields using the aggregation pipeline.
