Upcoming Breaking Changes
-------------------------

In accordance with the `MongoDB Software Lifecycle Schedules
<https://www.mongodb.com/legal/support-policy/lifecycles>`__, an upcoming minor
version of {+driver-short+} will raise the minimum {+mdb-server+} version from
4.0 to 4.2. {+driver-short+} will no longer support {+mdb-server+} 4.0. To learn
how to upgrade your driver version, see the :ref:`pymongo-upgrade` guide.

.. _version-4.11:

What's New in 4.11
------------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes

   {+driver-short+} v4.11 contains breaking changes. For more information, see
   :ref:`version-4.11-breaking-changes`.

The {+driver-short+} v4.11 release includes the following new features:

- Adds support for free-threaded CPython when running Python v3.13+. 
  For more information about free threading, see the 
  `Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/free-threading-python.html>`__.
- In-use encryption requires ``pymongocrypt`` v1.12 or later.
- The ``MongoClient.address()`` and ``AsyncMongoClient.address()`` methods correctly block
  when called on unconnected clients.
- Adds ``__repr__`` support for the ``IndexModel`` and ``SearchIndexModel`` classes.
- Adds a ``sort`` parameter to the following methods:
  
  - ``Collection.update_one()``
  - ``Collection.replace_one()``
  - ``operations.UpdateOne()``
  - ``operations.UpdateMany()``

- The ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` and ``AsyncMongoClient.bulk_write()`` methods throw an
  error error if you use them with unacknowledged writes when the 
  ``ordered`` or ``verboseResults`` options are set to ``True``.
- Fixes a bug that caused ``DatetimeMS`` to be incorrectly encoded as
  ``'{"$date": "X"}'`` instead of ``'{"$date": X}'`` when using the the legacy
  MongoDB Extended JSON datetime representation.
- Fixes a bug that caused the ``bson.json_util.loads()`` method to raise an ``IndexError``
  instead of a ``ValueError`` when parsing an invalid ``$date`` value.

.. _version-4.10:

What's New in 4.10
------------------

The {+driver-short+} v4.10 release includes the following new features:

- Adds provisional support for a new binary BSON subtype (9), which can be used
  for efficient storage and retrieval of :atlas:`vectors
  </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/#std-term-vector>` by using the
  ``bson.binary.Binary.from_vector()`` and ``bson.binary.Binary.as_vector()``
  methods. Support for BSON subtype 9 is in beta and is subject to change before the
  generally available release.
- Adds ``"c"`` to the ``driver.name`` client metadata field when an application uses the C extension.
- Fixes a bug that could cause ``AsyncMongoClient`` to deadlock.

.. _version-4.9:

What's New in 4.9
-----------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes

   {+driver-short+} v4.9 contains breaking changes. For more information, see
   :ref:`version-4.9-breaking-changes`.

The {+driver-short+} v4.9 release includes the following new features:

- Adds support for {+mdb-server+} 8.0 and Python 3.13.
- Adds support for Queryable Encryption range queries. To use this
  feature, your app must connect to {+mdb-server+} 8.0 or later. For
  more information about Queryable Encryption, see :manual:`Queryable
  Encryption </core/queryable-encryption>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
- Adds a new experimental asynchronous API as a replacement for Motor. This API
  is in beta and is subject to change before the generally available release.

.. TODO: Add link to the Pymongo Async migration guide

.. _version-4.8:

What's New in 4.8
-----------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes

   {+driver-short+} v4.8 contains breaking changes. For more information, see
   :ref:`version-4.8-breaking-changes`.
   
The {+driver-short+} v4.8 release includes the following new features:

- Implemented Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) automation in the release
  process. GitHub releases include a software bill of materials (SBOM) and signature
  files corresponding to the distribution files released on PyPI.
- In objects of type ``bson.binary.Binary``, the ``repr()`` method is redacted when the binary
  subtype is ``SENSITIVE_SUBTYPE`` (``8``).
- Fixed a bug in change streams where both the ``startAtOperationTime`` and ``resumeToken``
  fields could be added to a retry attempt, which caused the retry to fail.
- On Windows, changed handshake metadata for ``os.name`` to ``Windows`` to improve import time.
- Improved performance of ``MongoClient`` operations, especially when the driver is
  running many operations concurrently.
- Added a fallback to the stdlib ``ssl`` module if importing the ``pyopenssl`` module
  fails with an ``AttributeError``.

.. _version-4.7:

What's New in 4.7
-----------------

.. warning:: Breaking Changes

   {+driver-short+} v4.7 contains breaking changes. For more information, see
   :ref:`version-4.7-breaking-changes`.

The {+driver-short+} v4.7 release includes the following new features:

- Added the ``Hello.connection_id``,
  `CommandStartedEvent.server_connection_id <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pymongo/monitoring.html#pymongo.monitoring.CommandStartedEvent.server_connection_id>`__,
  `CommandSucceededEvent.server_connection_id <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pymongo/monitoring.html#pymongo.monitoring.CommandSucceededEvent.server_connection_id>`__,
  and `CommandFailedEvent.server_connection_id <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pymongo/monitoring.html#pymongo.monitoring.CommandFailedEvent.server_connection_id>`__
  properties.
- Added support for name suffixes for Key Management Service (KMS) providers for Client-Side Field
  Level Encryption (CSFLE). This feature requires ``pymongocrypt`` v1.9+ and
  ``libmongocrypt`` v1.9+. For more information, see the API documentation for the
  `AutoEncryptionOpts <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pymongo/encryption_options.html#pymongo.encryption_options.AutoEncryptionOpts>`__
  class.
- Improved the performance of encoding BSON documents to JSON.
- The ``ClientEncryption.encrypt()`` and ``ClientEncryption.encrypt_expression()`` methods
  now allow the ``key_id`` argument to be passed in as a ``UUID`` Object.
- Inflating a ``RawBSONDocument`` object containing a ``Code`` value no longer causes an
  error.
- Fixed a bug in Python 3.12 where the error message
  ``RuntimeError: can't create new thread at interpreter shutdown``
  could be written to ``stderr`` when a ``MongoClient`` thread starts as the Python
  interpreter is shutting down.
- Fixed a bug where ``Int64`` instances could not always be encoded by
  `orjson <https://github.com/ijl/orjson>`__. Code like the following example now
  runs correctly:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import orjson
   >>> from bson import json_util
   >>> orjson.dumps({'a': Int64(1)}, default=json_util.default, option=orjson.OPT_PASSTHROUGH_SUBCLASS)
