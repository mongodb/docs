Overview
--------

To use the {+driver-short+}, you must first create an instance of the ``mongocxx::instance``
class. This instance performs the following functions in your application:

- Initializes and shuts down the {+driver-short+}
- Initializes driver dependencies
- Ensures the driver functions correctly
- Manages the lifetimes of resources that
  are shared among ``mongocxx::client`` objects, such as the connection pool
  and BSON library

This guide shows you how to create a ``mongocxx::instance`` object.

Create a ``mongocxx::instance``
-------------------------------

To create a ``mongocxx::instance`` object, include the 
``mongocxx/instance.hpp`` header file in your application. Then,
construct an instance of ``mongocxx::instance`` at the start of your application,
as shown in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/instance.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :copyable: true

.. important::

   You must create a ``mongocxx::instance`` object before you use the
   {+driver-short+}, and this object must remain
   alive for as long as any other MongoDB objects are in scope.
