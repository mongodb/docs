This tutorial takes you through the steps of setting up and querying
an |fts| index. You will use a collection with movie data
from the |service| :doc:`sample data set </sample-data>`.

.. note:: Feature Unavailable in {+Serverless-Instances+}

   {+Serverless-instances+} don't support this feature at this time. To 
   learn more, see :doc:`{+Serverless-Instance+} Limitations 
   </reference/serverless-instance-limitations/>`.

  {+cluster+}

- One of the following applications to run queries on your |service|
  {+cluster+}:

  - :ref:`Search Tester <atlas-search-query-ui>`
  - {+mongosh+}
  - {+Compass+}

   To learn more about |fts|, you can take `Unit 9 of the Intro To
   MongoDB Course on MongoDB University
   <https://learn.mongodb.com/courses/mongodb-atlas-search>`__. The 1.5
   hour unit includes an overview of |fts| and lessons on how to create
   |fts| indexes, use :pipeline:`$search` with compound operators, and
   group results using :ref:`fts-facet-ref`.
