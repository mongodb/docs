You can upgrade the major, minor, and/or feature compatibility versions
of your MongoDB resource. These settings are configured in your
resource's |k8s-configmap|.

- To upgrade your resource's major and/or minor versions, set the
  :setting:`spec.version` setting to the desired MongoDB version.

- To modify your resource's
  :manual:`feature compatibility version </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/>`,
  set the :setting:`spec.featureCompatibilityVersion` setting to the
  desired version.

.. note::

   If you update ``spec.version`` to a later version, consider setting
   :setting:`spec.featureCompatibilityVersion` to the current working
   MongoDB version to give yourself the option to downgrade if
   necessary.

   To learn more about feature compatibility, see
   :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` in the MongoDB Manual.
