          date boundary to the organization's creation date.

      .. include:: /includes/billing/list-table-invoice-card.rst
      
   .. step:: Pay your invoice.
      
      If you have a :ref:`subscription <activate-subscription>` with an
      amount due, your invoice's :guilabel:`Payment Details` section displays
      the :guilabel:`PAY NOW` action in the :guilabel:`Actions` column for
      the subscription payment method. This allows you to pay your
      tax invoices for your monthly commitment or elastic
