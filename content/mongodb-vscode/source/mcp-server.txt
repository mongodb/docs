|vsce-full| includes the MongoDB MCP server, a model context protocol (MCP) server
that lets you interact with your MongoDB data from AI assistants and tools.

To learn more about the MongoDB MCP server, see the
`MongoDB MCP Server documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mcp-server/>`__.

Overview
--------

The MongoDB MCP Server lets you use natural language 
to interact with your MongoDB data from AI clients like 
Github Copilot, and any other MCP-compatible AI clients in VS Code.

The MongoDB MCP server in the |vsce| uses the same connection
as your active MongoDB connection in VS Code.
When you switch connections in VS Code, the MCP server automatically updates to 
proxy the new connection. The server runs locally on your machine and only 
provides access to the MongoDB deployment that you're currently connected to in VS Code.

.. note::
  
   By default, the MCP server starts automatically when you use 
   the |vsce| to connect to your MongoDB deployment.
   You can disable this behavior the first time this happens, or at any time
   by using the :ref:`mdb.mcp.server <vsce-setting-mcp-server>` setting.

Manage the MCP Server
---------------------

To manage the MongoDB MCP server from the |vsce|, see 
the :ref:`MCP Server settings <vsce-setting-mcp-server>`.

The MongoDB VS Code Extension also includes the following commands:

- :ref:`Start MCP Server <vsce-cmd-mcp-start>`
- :ref:`Stop MCP Server <vsce-cmd-mcp-stop>`
- :ref:`Get MCP Server Config <vsce-cmd-mcp-config>`
