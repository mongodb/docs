Description
-----------

Returns either an updated status of the synchronization process or an error.

Request
-------

.. code-block:: http
   :copyable: false

   GET /api/v1/progress 

Response
--------

The ``progress`` endpoint returns either an updated status or an error.

Successful Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The response object contains 2 top-level fields, ``success`` and
``progress``. 

The ``success`` field contains the status of the ``progress`` command. 
Value is ``true`` if always ``true``. 

If ``mongosync`` successfully gets the status of the sync process, 
all response fields are wrapped in the top-level ``progress`` object 
with the following fields:

.. include:: /includes/api/tables/progress-response.rst

Error Response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``mongosync`` encounters an error, the ``progress`` endpoint returns 
the following fields:

.. include:: /includes/api/tables/progress-error-response.rst

Behavior
--------

- When ``mongosync`` is in the ``IDLE`` state, all output
  fields except ``state`` and ``canCommit`` are ``null``.
  
- When ``mongosync`` is in the ``PAUSED`` state, the
  ``lagTimeSeconds`` field is ``null``.

- The endpoint does not auto-refresh. To get updated status, call the
  ``progress`` endpoint again.

- Calls to ``/progress`` before ``mongosync`` reaches the collection
  copy phase return 0 for ``estimatedCopiedBytes`` and 1 for 
  ``estimatedTotalBytes``.

- ``estimatedTotalBytes`` may change throughout the collection copy 
  phase if documents are inserted or deleted on the source cluster.

- ``estimatedCopiedBytes`` is never greater than 
  ``estimatedTotalBytes``. Progress reaches 100% at the end of the 
  collection copy phase (``estimatedCopiedBytes`` = 
  ``estimatedTotalBytes``).

- When performing a live upgrade from an earlier version to 1.8.0 or 
  higher, the collection copy data starts over from 
  ``[0 bytes copied / 1 bytes total]``. After a live upgrade, 
  ``/progress`` only reports the progress of data copied after the 
  upgrade completed.
