.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: shardCollection

   The :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command marks a collection for sharding and
   will allow data to begin distributing among shards. You must run
   :dbcommand:`enableSharding` on a database before running the
   :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { shardCollection: "<db>.<collection>", key: { "<shardkey>": 1 } }

   This enables sharding for the collection specified by
   ``<collection>`` in the database named ``<db>``, using the key
   ``<shardkey>`` to distribute documents among the shard.

   Choosing the right shard key to effectively distribute load among
   your shards requires some planning.

   .. seealso:: :doc:`/sharding` for more information related to
      sharding. Also consider the section on :ref:`sharding-shard-key`
      for documentation regarding shard keys.

   .. warning::

      There's no easy way to disable sharding after running :dbcommand:`shardCollection`. In addition,
      you cannot change shard keys once set. If you must convert a sharded cluster to a :term:`standalone`
      node or :term:`replica set`, you must make a single backup of the entire cluster
      and then restore the backup to the standalone :program:`mongod`
      or the replica set..
