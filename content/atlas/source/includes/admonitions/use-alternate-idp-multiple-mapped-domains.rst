.. important::

   You can map a single domain to multiple identity providers. If you
   do, users who log in using the MongoDB Cloud console are
   automatically redirected to the first matching |idp| mapped to the
   domain.

   To log in using an alternative identity provider, users must either:

   - Initiate the MongoDB Cloud login through the desired |idp|, or
   - Log in using the :guilabel:`Login URL` associated with the desired
     |idp|.
