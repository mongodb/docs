This tutorial outlines the process for deploying a :term:`replica set` with members
in multiple locations. The tutorial addresses three-member sets,
four-member sets, and sets with more than four members.

For appropriate background, see :doc:`/core/replication` and
:doc:`/administration/replica-set-architectures`. For related
tutorials, see :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set` and
:doc:`/tutorial/expand-replica-set`.

Overview
--------

While :term:`replica sets <replica set>` provide basic protection
against single-instance failure, when all of the members of a replica
set reside in a single facility, the replica set is still susceptible
to some classes of errors in that facility including power outages,
networking distortions, and natural disasters. To protect against
these classes of failures, deploy a replica set with one or more
members in a geographically distinct facility or data center.

Requirements
------------

If possible, use an odd number of data centers, and choose a
distribution of members that maximizes the likelihood that even with a
loss of a data center, the remaining replica set members can form a
majority or at minimum, provide a copy of your data.

If you deploy a replica set with an uneven number of members, add an
:ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiters>`.

For all configurations in this tutorial, deploy each replica set member
on a separate system. Although you may deploy more than one replica set member on a
single system, doing so reduces the redundancy and capacity
of the replica set. Such deployments are typically for testing
purposes and beyond the scope of this tutorial.

Deploy a Distributed Three-Member Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A geographically distributed three-member deployment has the following
features:

- Each member of the replica set resides on its own machine, and the
  MongoDB processes all bind to port ``27017``, which is the standard
  MongoDB port.

- Each member of the replica set must be accessible by way of
  resolvable DNS or hostnames in the following scheme:

  - ``mongodb0.example.net``
  - ``mongodb1.example.net``
  - ``mongodb2.example.net``

  Configure DNS names appropriately, *or* set up your systems'
  ``/etc/hosts`` file to reflect this configuration.

- Ensure that network traffic can pass between all members in the
  network securely and efficiently. Consider the following:

  - Establish a virtual private network between the systems in Site A
    and Site B to encrypt all traffic between the sites and remains
    private. Ensure that your network topology routes all traffic between
    members within a single site over the local area network.

  - Configure authentication using :setting:`auth` and
    :setting:`keyFile`, so that only servers and process with
    authentication can connect to the replica set.

  - Configure networking and firewall rules so that only traffic
    (incoming and outgoing packets) on the default MongoDB port
    (e.g. ``27017``) from *within* your deployment.

    .. seealso:: For more information on security and firewalls, see :ref:`replica-set-security`.

- Specify run-time configuration on each system in a
  :doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>` stored in
  ``/etc/mongodb.conf`` or in a related location. *Do not* specify
  run-time configuration through command line options.

  For each MongoDB instance, use the following configuration, with values
  set appropriate to your systems:

  .. code-block:: cfg

     port = 27017

     bind_ip = 10.8.0.10

     dbpath = /srv/mongodb/

     fork = true

     replSet = rs0/mongodb0.example.net,mongodb1.example.net,mongodb2.example.net

  Modify :setting:`bind_ip` to reflect a secure interface on your
  system that is able to access all other members of the set *and*
  that is accessible to all other members of the replica set. The DNS or
  host names need to point and resolve to this IP address. Configure
  network rules or a virtual private network (i.e. "VPN") to permit this
  access.

  .. note::

     The portion of the :setting:`replSet` following the ``/`` provides
     a "seed list" of known members of the replica set.
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` uses this list to fetch configuration changes
     following restarts. It is acceptable to omit this section entirely,
     and have the :setting:`replSet` option resemble:

     .. code-block:: cfg

        replSet = rs0

  For more documentation on the above run time configurations, as well as
  additional configuration options, see
  :doc:`/reference/configuration-options`.

To deploy a geographically distributed three-member set:

1. On each system start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process by issuing a
   command similar to following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf

   .. note::

      In production deployments you likely want to use and configure a
      :term:`control script` to manage this process based on this
      command. Control scripts are beyond the scope of this document.

#. Open a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected to *one* of the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo

#. Use the :method:`rs.initiate()` method on *one* member to initiate
   a replica set consisting of the current member and using the
   default configuration:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.initiate()

#. Display the current :doc:`replica configuration </reference/replica-configuration>`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.conf()

#. Add the remaining members to the replica set by issuing a sequence of
   commands similar to the following. The example commands assume the
   current :term:`primary` is ``mongodb0.example.net``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.add("mongodb1.example.net")
      rs.add("mongodb2.example.net")

#. Optional. Configure the member eligibility for becoming primary.
   In some cases, you may prefer that the members in one data center be
   elected primary before the members in the other data centers.

   a. Issue the following command to determine the
      :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n]._id` value for
      ``mongodb2.example.net``:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.conf()

   #. In the :data:`~local.system.replset.members` array, find the array
      index of the member to configure. The example in
      the next step assumes this value is ``2``.

   #. In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected to the replica set's
      primary, issue a command sequence similar to the following:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         cfg = rs.conf()
         cfg.members[2].priority = 0
         rs.reconfig(cfg)

      .. note::

         In some situations, the :method:`rs.reconfig()` shell method
         can force the current primary to step down and causes an
         election. When the primary steps down, all clients will
         disconnect. This is the intended behavior. While, this
         typically takes 10-20 seconds, attempt to make these changes
         during scheduled maintenance periods.

   After these commands return you have a geographically distributed
   three-member replica set.

#. To check the status of your replica set, issue :method:`rs.status()`.

.. seealso:: The documentation of the following shell functions for
   more information:

   - :method:`rs.initiate()`
   - :method:`rs.conf()`
   - :method:`rs.reconfig()`
   - :method:`rs.add()`

.. _replica-set-deploy-distributed-four-member:

Deploy a Distributed Four-Member Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A geographically distributed four-member deployment has the following
features:

- Each member of the replica set, except for the :term:`arbiter` (see
  below), resides on its own machine, and the MongoDB processes all bind
  to port ``27017``, which is the standard MongoDB port.

- Each member of the replica set must be accessible by way of
  resolvable DNS or hostnames in the following scheme:

  - ``mongodb0.example.net``
  - ``mongodb1.example.net``
  - ``mongodb2.example.net``
  - ``mongodb3.example.net``

  Configure DNS names appropriately, *or* set up your systems'
  ``/etc/host`` file to reflect this configuration.

- One host (e.g. ``mongodb3.example.net``) will be an :term:`arbiter`
  and can run on a system that is also used for an application server
  or some other shared purpose.

- There are three possible architectures for this replica set:

  - Two members in Site A, two :ref:`secondary-only members
    <replica-set-secondary-only-members>` in Site B, and an
    arbiter in Site A.

  - Three members in Site A and one secondary-only member in Site B.

  - Two members in Site A, one secondary-only member in Site B, one
    secondary-only member in Site C, and an arbiter in site A.

  In most cases the first architecture is preferable because it is the
  least complex.

- Ensure that network traffic can pass between all members in the
  network securely and efficiently. Consider the following:

  - Establish a virtual private network between the systems in Site A
    and Site B (and Site C if it exists) to encrypt all traffic
    between the sites and remains private. Ensure that your network
    topology routes all traffic between members within a single site
    over the local area network.

  - Configure authentication using :setting:`auth` and
    :setting:`keyFile`, so that only servers and process with
    authentication can connect to the replica set.

  - Configure networking and firewall rules so that only traffic
    (incoming and outgoing packets) on the default MongoDB port
    (e.g. ``27017``) from *within* your deployment.

    .. seealso:: For more information on security and firewalls, see :ref:`replica-set-security`.

- Specify run-time configuration on each system in a
  :doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>` stored in
  ``/etc/mongodb.conf`` or in a related location. *Do not* specify
  run-time configuration through command line options.

  For each MongoDB instance, use the following configuration, with values
  set appropriate to your systems:

  .. code-block:: cfg

     port = 27017

     bind_ip = 10.8.0.10

     dbpath = /srv/mongodb/

     fork = true

     replSet = rs0/mongodb0.example.net,mongodb1.example.net,mongodb2.example.net,mongodb3.example.net

  Modify :setting:`bind_ip` to reflect a secure interface on your
  system that is able to access all other members of the set *and*
  that is accessible to all other members of the replica set. The DNS or
  host names need to point and resolve to this IP address. Configure
  network rules or a virtual private network (i.e. "VPN") to permit this
  access.

  .. note::

     The portion of the :setting:`replSet` following the ``/`` provides
     a "seed list" of known members of the replica set.
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` uses this list to fetch configuration changes
     following restarts. It is acceptable to omit this section entirely,
     and have the :setting:`replSet` option resemble:

     .. code-block:: cfg

        replSet = rs0

  For more documentation on the above run time configurations, as well
  as additional configuration options, see
  doc:`/reference/configuration-options`.

To deploy a geographically distributed four-member set:

1. On each system start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process by issuing a
   command similar to following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf

   .. note::

      In production deployments you likely want to use and configure a
      :term:`control script` to manage this process based on this
      command. Control scripts are beyond the scope of this document.

#. Open a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected to this host:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo

#. Use :method:`rs.initiate()` to initiate a replica set consisting of
   the current member and using the default configuration:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.initiate()

#. Display the current :doc:`replica configuration </reference/replica-configuration>`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.conf()

#. Add the remaining members to the replica set by issuing a sequence of
   commands similar to the following. The example commands assume the
   current :term:`primary` is ``mongodb0.example.net``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.add("mongodb1.example.net")
      rs.add("mongodb2.example.net")
      rs.add("mongodb3.example.net")

#. In the same shell session, issue the following command to add the
   arbiter (e.g. ``mongodb4.example.net``):

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.addArb("mongodb4.example.net")

#. Optional. Configure the member eligibility for becoming primary.
   In some cases, you may prefer that the members in one data center be
   elected primary before the members in the other data centers.

   a. Issue the following command to determine the
      :data:`~local.system.replset.members[n]._id` value for the member:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.conf()

   #. In the :data:`~local.system.replset.members` array, find the array
      index of the member to configure. The example in
      the next step assumes this value is ``2``.

   #. In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected to the replica set's
      primary, issue a command sequence similar to the following:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         cfg = rs.conf()
         cfg.members[2].priority = 0
         rs.reconfig(cfg)

      .. note::

         In some situations, the :method:`rs.reconfig()` shell method
         can force the current primary to step down and causes an
         election. When the primary steps down, all clients will
         disconnect. This is the intended behavior. While, this
         typically takes 10-20 seconds, attempt to make these changes
         during scheduled maintenance periods.

   After these commands return you have a geographically distributed
   four-member replica set.

#. To check the status of your replica set, issue :method:`rs.status()`.

.. seealso:: The documentation of the following shell functions for
   more information:

   - :method:`rs.initiate()`
   - :method:`rs.conf()`
   - :method:`rs.reconfig()`
   - :method:`rs.add()`

Deploy a Distributed Set with More than Four Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The above procedures detail the steps necessary for deploying a
geographically redundant replica set. Larger replica set deployments
generally follow the same steps, but have additional considerations:

- Never deploy more than seven voting members.

- If you have an even number of members, similar to :ref:`the procedure
  for a four-member set <replica-set-deploy-distributed-four-member>`,
  deploy an arbiter.
