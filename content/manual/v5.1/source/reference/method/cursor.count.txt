.. method:: cursor.count()


   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method.rst


   .. note::

      MongoDB drivers compatible with the 4.0 features deprecate their
      respective cursor and collection ``count()`` APIs in favor of new
      APIs that corresponds to ``countDocuments()`` and
      ``estimatedDocumentCount()``. For the specific API names for a
      given driver, see the driver API documentation.

   Counts the number of documents referenced by a cursor. Append the
   :method:`~cursor.count()` method to a
   :method:`~db.collection.find()` query to return the number of
   matching documents. The operation does not perform the query but
   instead counts the results that would be returned by the query.

   .. important::

      - Avoid using :method:`~cursor.count()` if the
        :method:`~db.collection.find()` operation is run without a
        query predicate since without the query predicate, these
        :method:`~cursor.count()` returns results based on the
        collection's metadata, which may result in an approximate
        count. In particular,
        
        - On a sharded cluster, the resulting count will not correctly
          filter out :term:`orphaned documents <orphaned document>`.

        - After an unclean shutdown, the count may be
          incorrect.

      - For counts based on collection metadata, see also
        :ref:`collStats pipeline stage with the count <collstat-count>`
        option.


   The :method:`~cursor.count()` method has the following
   prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find(<query>).count()

   The :method:`~cursor.count()` method has the following
   parameter:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``applySkipLimit``
   
        - boolean
   
        - Optional. Specifies whether to consider the effects of the
          :method:`cursor.skip()` and :method:`cursor.limit()` methods in the
          count. By default, the :method:`~cursor.count()` method
          ignores the effects of the :method:`cursor.skip()` and
          :method:`cursor.limit()`. Set ``applySkipLimit`` to ``true`` to
          consider the effect of these methods.
          
          
   


   MongoDB also provides an equivalent :method:`db.collection.count()`
   as an alternative to the ``db.collection.find(<query>).count()``
   construct.

   MongoDB supports the use of :method:`~cursor.hint()` with
   :method:`~cursor.count()`. See :ref:`count-method-hint` for an
   example.

      :method:`cursor.size()`


Behavior
--------

Count and Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot use :dbcommand:`count` and shell helpers
:method:`~cursor.count()` and :method:`db.collection.count()` in
:ref:`transactions <transactions-ops-count>`.

For details, see :ref:`Transactions and Count Operations
<transactions-ops-count>`.

Sharded Clusters

Index Use
~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-count-index-use.rst

Examples
--------

The following are examples of the :method:`~cursor.count()` method.

Count All Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation counts the number of all documents in the
``orders`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.find().count()

Count Documents That Match a Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation counts the number of the documents in the
``orders`` collection with the field ``ord_dt`` greater than ``new
Date('01/01/2012')``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.find( { ord_dt: { $gt: new Date('01/01/2012') } } ).count()

Limit Documents in Count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation counts the number of the documents in the
``orders`` collection with the field ``ord_dt`` greater than ``new
Date('01/01/2012')`` *taking into account* the effect of the
``limit(5)``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.find( { ord_dt: { $gt: new Date('01/01/2012') } } ).limit(5).count(true)

.. _count-method-hint:

Specify the Index to Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation uses the index named ``"status_1"``, which has
the index key specification of ``{ status: 1 }``, to return a count of
the documents in the ``orders`` collection with the field ``ord_dt``
greater than ``new Date('01/01/2012')`` and the ``status`` field is
equal to ``"D"``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.find(
      { ord_dt: { $gt: new Date('01/01/2012') }, status: "D" }
   ).hint( "status_1" ).count()
