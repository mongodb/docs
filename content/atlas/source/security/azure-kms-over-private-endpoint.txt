You can use a customer-managed key (CMK) from Azure Key Vault (AKV)
to further encrypt your data at rest in |service|. You can also
configure all traffic to your |akv| to use {+az-pl+}.

This page describes how to use the {+atlas-admin-api+} to automatically
set up {+az-pl+} in your |akv| to ensure that all traffic between
|service| and |akv| take place over |azure|\'s private network
interfaces. 

Considerations 
--------------

Before you enable Encryption at Rest using |akv| over private endpoints,
review the following use cases, benefits, limitations, and prerequisites.

Use Case 
~~~~~~~~

Suppose your |service| deployment is on a single cloud service provider.
You now have a requirement that all access to your |akv| occur over your
cloud provider's private networking infrastructure. This page walks you
through the steps to enable private endpoint connections for your
|service| project. 

Benefits
~~~~~~~~

You can use the {+atlas-admin-api+} to allow |service| to configure
Encryption At Rest with |akv| using private endpoints. This allows all
traffic to |akv| to pass through a set of private endpoints and avoid
exposing |akv| to the public internet or public IP addresses. It
eliminates the need to maintain allowed IP addresses while enhancing
data security by keeping all |akv| traffic within |azure|'s private
network.  

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

- |service| doesn't support Encryption at Rest using |cmk| over
  private endpoints for multi-cloud deployments. If you enable encryption
  at rest using |cmk| over {+az-pl+} in an existing project with
  multi-cloud {+clusters+}, |service| disables the multi-cloud
  {+clusters+} in your project.

- |service| doesn't support Encryption at Rest using |cmk| over
  private endpoints for projects in the ``INACTIVE`` state.

- Once you've :ref:`set up a private endpoint connection <azure-kms-enable-pvt-endpoint>` to your |akv|, you can't modify
  the :guilabel:`Key Vault Name`, :guilabel:`Subscription ID`, or :guilabel:`Resource Group Name` of your |akv|, but you can still :ref:`rotate the {+azure+} Key Identifier <rotate-azure-key-identifier>`. 
  To modify these values, you must first :ref:`remove all private endpoint connections <azure-remove-reject-pvt-endpoint>`.

Multi-Region Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using a multi-region cluster, you must create a private endpoint for 
your |akv| in **each region** where your cluster is deployed.

Prerequisites
-------------

To enable customer-managed keys with |akv| for a MongoDB project, you
must:

.. include:: /includes/fact-azure-kms-prereqs.rst

- If your :guilabel:`App registrations` use `conditional access 
  policies <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/workload-identity>`__,
  which is uncommon, you must :ref:`allow requests from Atlas 
  Control Plane IP addresses <atlas-add-inbound-ips>` and :oas-bump-atlas-op:`the public 
  IP addresses of your cluster nodes <getgroupipaddresses>` for app registration. This is used 
  only for app registration and not used for key vault access. 

.. note:: 

   You must register **Microsoft.Network** under your |azure|
   subscription resource providers. To learn more, see :azure:`Azure
   documentation </azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types>`. 

Procedures 
----------

.. _azure-kms-configure-project-pvt-endpoint:

Enable Customer-Managed Keys for a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must enable |cmk| for a project before you can enable it on a
{+cluster+} in that project. You can enable |cmk| for a project from the
{+atlas-ui+} and {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Atlas UI 
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-configure-azure-encryption-for-project-ui.rst

   .. tab:: Atlas Admin API 
      :tabid: api

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-configure-azure-encryption-for-project-api.rst  

.. _azure-kms-enable-pvt-endpoint:

Enable and Set up Private Endpoint Connections for a Project 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enable and set up private endpoints by using the {+atlas-ui+} and 
{+atlas-admin-api+}. To enable private networking and set up a private
endpoint in your |akv|, you must do the following: 

.. tabs::    

   .. tab:: Atlas UI 
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-azure-enable-private-endpoint-connections-ui.rst

   .. tab:: Atlas Admin API 
      :tabid: apizure-view-pvt-endpoints

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-azure-enable-private-endpoint-connections-api.rst

After you enable Encryption at Rest Using |cmk| (Over Private
Networking) for your project, you can enable :ref:`Encryption at Rest 
<azure-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest-pvt-endpoint>` using |cmk| for
each |service| {+cluster+} in your project. 

.. _azure-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest-pvt-endpoint:

Enable Customer Key Management for an |service| Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you :ref:`azure-kms-configure-project`, you must enable customer key
management for each |service| {+cluster+} that contains data that you want
to encrypt. If you configured private endpoint connections for your
|service| project, |service| automatically migrates all {+clusters+} for
which you already enabled :ref:`customer managed keys
<azure-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest-pvt-endpoint>`, including
existing {+clusters+} that allow connections using public internet, to
use only the private endpoint connection. 

.. note::

   You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner <Project Owner>` role to
   enable customer key management for {+clusters+} in that project.

For new clusters, toggle the :ref:`Manage your own encryption keys 
<create-cluster-enable-encryption>` setting to :guilabel:`Yes`, if it
isn't already enabled, when you create the cluster.  

For existing clusters:

.. include:: /includes/steps-cluster-customer-key-management.rst

Disable Customer-Managed Keys for a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable |cmk| for a project, you must first :ref:`remove
<azure-remove-reject-pvt-endpoint>` all private endpoints associated 
with the project, regardless of their state. |service| displays an error if
you attempt to disable |cmk| for a project that is associated with
active private endpoints. 

After removing all private endpoints for a project, you must disable
customer key management on each {+cluster+} in the project before you 
disable the feature for the project.

.. warning::

   Do *not* disable or delete any |akv| keys that any {+cluster+} in your
   |service| project uses before you have disabled customer key
   management within the |service| project. If |service| can't access
   an |akv| key, any data that the key encrypted becomes inaccessible.

.. _azure-kms-create-pvt-endpoint:

Create New Endpoints for a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After enabling and setting up private endpoint connections for your
project, you can add additional endpoints at anytime from the
{+atlas-ui+} and the {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Atlas UI 
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-azure-create-private-endpoints-ui.rst

   .. tab:: Atlas Admin API 
      :tabid: api

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-azure-create-private-endpoints-api.rst

.. _azure-remove-reject-pvt-endpoint:

Reject or Remove Private Endpoint Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove private endpoint connections from the {+atlas-ui+} and
the {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Atlas UI 
      :tabid: ui

      .. |ear-key-provider| replace:: :guilabel:`Azure Key Vault`

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-delete-ear-private-endpoint-connections-ui.rst

   .. tab:: Atlas Admin API 
      :tabid: api

      To remove a private endpoint, send a ``DELETE`` request to
      the {+atlas-admin-api+} :oas-bump-atlas-op:`endpoint
      <requestencryptionatrestprivateendpointdeletion>` and specify the ID of
      the project and of the private endpoint that you want to delete. You can 
      retrieve the ID of the private endpoint that you want to delete by sending 
      a ``GET`` request to the {+atlas-admin-api+} :oas-bump-atlas-op:`Return One Private 
      Endpoint Service for One Provider 
      <getgroupprivateendpointservice>` endpoint.

      .. example:: 

         .. code-block:: json
            
            curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
            --header "Accept: application/vnd.atlas.2024-10-23+json" \\ or a different version of the Atlas Admin API
            --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
            --include \
            --request DELETE "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v2/groups/{groupId}/encryptionAtRest/AZURE/privateEndpoints/{endpointId}" \ 
            --data '
            {
               "cloudProvider": "AZURE",
               "regions": [
                  "string"
               ]
            }'

When you delete a private endpoint, the private endpoint transitions to
the ``DELETING`` status while |service| deletes the private endpoint.

If you remove or reject an active private endpoint from the |azure| UI,
|service| automatically attempts to recreate a new private endpoint in
the same region. You can check the status of the private endpoint from
the {+atlas-ui+} and the {+atlas-admin-api+}. To learn more, see
:ref:`azure-view-pvt-endpoints`. 

While |service| attempts to create a new private endpoint, the status of
the private endpoint that you rejected or removed transitions to
``PENDING_RECREATION`` and the new endpoint that |service| attempts to
create is in ``INITIATING`` state. You must approve the new private
endpoint after it is created. 

.. _azure-view-pvt-endpoints:

View Private Endpoints and their Statuses 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view the private endpoints in the various regions and their
statuses from the {+atlas-ui+} and the {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Atlas UI 
      :tabid: ui

      .. |ear-key-provider| replace:: :guilabel:`Azure Key Vault`

      .. procedure:: 
         :style: normal

         .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-advanced.rst

         .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-ear-pvt-endpoints-mgmnt-page.rst

      Each private endpoint can be in one of the following statuses:

      .. include:: /includes/list-tables/azure-pvt-endpoint-statuses-ui.rst

   .. tab:: Atlas Admin API 
      :tabid: api

      You can view the private endpoint and their statuses from the
      {+atlas-admin-api+} by sending a ``GET`` request to the
      {+atlas-admin-api+} ``encryptionAtRest`` 
      :oas-bump-atlas-op:`get all <listgroupencryptionatrestprivateendpoints>` 
      endpoint or :oas-bump-atlas-op:`get one <getgroupencryptionatrestprivateendpoint>` 
      endpoint, for which you must specify the ID of the private endpoint
      in the path. 

      .. example:: Return All Private Endpoints for One Project

         .. code-block:: 
            :copyable: true
            
            curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
            --header "Accept: application/vnd.atlas.2024-10-23+json" \\ or a different version of the Atlas Admin API
            --header "Content-Type: application/json" \

            --request GET "https://cloud.mongodb.com/api/atlas/v2/groups/{groupId}/encryptionAtRest/AZURE/privateEndpoints/"      

      Each private endpoint can be in one of the following statuses:

      .. include:: /includes/list-tables/azure-pvt-endpoint-statuses-api.rst

.. _azure-disable-pvt-endpoint:

Disable Private Endpoint Connections for a Project 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable private endpoint connections for a project, you must first
:ref:`remove <azure-remove-reject-pvt-endpoint>` all private endpoints, 
associated with the project, regardless of their state. |service|
doesn't disable private endpoint connections for a project if the
project is associated with active private endpoints.

After removing all private endpoints for a project, you can disable
private endpoint connections for the project by using the {+atlas-ui+}
and the {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Atlas UI 
      :tabid: ui

      .. |ear-key-provider| replace:: :guilabel:`Azure Key Vault`

      .. include:: /includes/ear/steps-disable-ear-private-endpoint-connections-ui.rst

   .. tab:: Atlas Admin API 
      :tabid: api

      To disable a private endpoint connection, send a 
      ``PATCH`` request to the :oas-bump-atlas-op:`endpoint
      <updateencryptionatrest>` with the ``requirePrivateNetworking`` boolean
      flag value set to ``false``.

      .. example:: 

         .. code-block:: shell 
            :emphasize-lines: 8

            {
              "azureKeyVault": {
                "azureEnvironment": "AZURE",
                "clientID": "632ff709-32a8-48a3-8224-30d2386fadaf",
                "enabled": true,
                "keyIdentifier": "https://EXAMPLEKeyVault.vault.azure.net/keys/EXAMPLEKey/d891821e3d364e9eb88fbd3d11807b86",
                "keyVaultName": "string",
                "requirePrivateNetworking": false,
                "resourceGroupName": "string",
                "secret": "string",
                "subscriptionID": "a39012fb-d604-4cd1-8841-77f705f3e6d5",

              }
            }

Revoke Access to an Encryption Key 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can revoke |service|'s access to an encryption key from within
|akv| to freeze your data. |service| automatically pauses your
{+clusters+} when you revoke access to the encryption key.

.. _rotate-azure-key-identifier:

Rotate your Azure Key Identifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. meta::
   :keywords: encryption

.. include:: /includes/unavailable-flex-m0-clusters.rst

Before you begin, learn :ref:`azure-kms-rotate-key`.

You must create a new key in the |akv| associated with your
|service| project. The following procedure documents how to rotate your
|service| project Key Identifier by specifying a new key identifier in
|service|.
