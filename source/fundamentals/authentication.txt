Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the authentication
mechanisms available in the MongoDB Community Edition. When you connect
to MongoDB, you can use an authentication mechanism to establish trust
between the driver and the server.

.. tip::

   To learn how to authenticate to MongoDB by using a Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server, see the guide on
   :ref:`rust-enterprise-auth`.

   To learn more about connecting to a MongoDB deployment, see the
   :ref:`rust-connect-to-mongodb`.

This guide describes the following authentication mechanisms:

- :ref:`SCRAM-Based Mechanisms <rust-auth-scram-mechanisms>`
- :ref:`MONGODB-AWS Mechanism <rust-auth-aws>`
- :ref:`MONGODB-X509 Mechanism <rust-auth-x509>`

To select a specific authentication mechanism, you can specify the
mechanism, your credentials, and other necessary information
in the options of your connection string or in a ``Credential`` struct.

In this guide, the examples demonstrate how to configure
authentication in a ``Credential`` struct.

To learn more about the connection string options for authentication,
see the :manual:`Authentication Options
</reference/connection-string/#authentication-options>` section
of the Connection String URI Format guide in the Server manual.

.. _rust-auth-scram-mechanisms:

SCRAM-Based Mechanisms
----------------------

Salted challenge response authentication mechanism (SCRAM) refers to a
group of authentication mechanisms that use a username and
password to authenticate to a server.

MongoDB supports the following SCRAM-based authentication mechanisms:

- :ref:`SCRAM-SHA-256 <rust-auth-scramsha256>`: an authentication mechanism that
  uses your database username and password, encrypted with the ``SHA-256``
  algorithm
- :ref:`SCRAM-SHA-1 <rust-auth-scramsha1>`: an authentication mechanism that
  uses your database username and password, encrypted with the ``SHA-1``
  algorithm

.. important:: Default Authentication Mechanism

   If you do not specify an authentication mechanism, the server
   attempts to validate credentials by using the default authentication
   mechanism, a SCRAM-based mechanism that varies depending on the
   version of the server that you are connecting to.

   The ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` mechanism is the default authentication
   mechanism for MongoDB Server versions 4.0 and later.

   To use the default authentication mechanism, omit only the
   ``mechanism`` field when you instantiate your ``Credential`` struct.
   This example uses the following placeholders:

   - ``db_username``: Your database username
   - ``db_password``: Your database password
   - ``db``: The authentication database associated with the user

   .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/auth.rs
      :language: rust
      :dedent:
      :start-after: start-default
      :end-before: end-default

.. _rust-auth-scramsha256:

SCRAM-SHA-256
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify the ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` authentication mechanism, set the
``mechanism`` field of your ``Credential`` struct to
``AuthMechanism::ScramSha256``. This example specifies the
authentication mechanism by using the following placeholders:

- ``db_username``: Your database username
- ``db_password``: Your database password
- ``db``: The authentication database associated with the user

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/auth.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-scramsha256
   :end-before: end-scramsha256

.. _rust-auth-scramsha1:

SCRAM-SHA-1
~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify the ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` authentication mechanism, set the
``mechanism`` field of your ``Credential`` struct to
``AuthMechanism::ScramSha1``. This example specifies the
authentication mechanism by using the following placeholders:

- ``db_username``: Your database username
- ``db_password``: Your database password
- ``db``: The authentication database associated with the user

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/auth.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-scramsha1
   :end-before: end-scramsha1

.. _rust-auth-aws:

MONGODB-AWS Mechanism
---------------------

The ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism uses your Amazon Web Services
Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) credentials to authenticate your
user.

To use this authentication mechanism, you must add the ``aws-auth``
feature flag to your ``mongodb`` dependency in your project's
``Cargo.toml`` file. The following shows an example of what your
``mongodb`` dependency feature list must include to enable the
``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism:

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   [dependencies.mongodb]
   version = "{+version+}"
   features = [ "aws-auth", ... ]

.. important::

   To use the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism in the
   {+driver-short+}, your application must meet the following
   requirements:

   - You are connected to MongoDB Server version 4.4 or later.
   - You are using the ``tokio`` asynchronous runtime.

The driver obtains the credentials only from the first source in which
they are found. The driver checks for your credentials from the following
sources in the following order:

1. ``Credential`` struct or connection string.
#. Environment variables.
#. Web identity token file.
#. AWS ECS endpoint specified in the ``AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI``
   environment variable.
#. AWS EC2 endpoint. For more information, see `IAM Roles for Tasks
   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html>`__
   in the AWS documentation.

For example, if you specify your AWS credentials in your connection string, the
driver uses those credentials and ignores any that you might have
specified in environment variables.

Select from the :guilabel:`Credential Struct`, :guilabel:`Environment
Variables`, and :guilabel:`Web Identity Token File` tabs below for
code samples that demonstrate how to set your AWS IAM credentials in
the corresponding ways.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Credential Struct
      :tabid: credential struct

      To specify the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism, set the
      ``mechanism`` field of your ``Credential`` struct to
      ``AuthMechanism::MongoDbAws``. This example specifies the
      authentication mechanism by using the following placeholders:

      - ``access key ID``: Your AWS access key ID
      - ``secret access key``: Your AWS secret access key
      - ``db``: The authentication database associated with the user

      If you are using temporary credentials, create a document that
      contains the value of your AWS session token, and then set the
      ``mechanism_properties`` field of the ``Credential`` struct to
      this document. If you are not using temporary credentials, omit
      line 9 of the following example:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/auth.rs
         :language: rust
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-aws
         :end-before: end-aws
         :linenos:

      .. tip::

         You can obtain temporary AWS IAM credentials from a Security
         Token Service (STS) Assume Role request. Learn more about
         this process in the `AssumeRole AWS documentation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html>`__.

   .. tab:: Environment Variables
      :tabid: environment variables

      To store your AWS credentials in environment variables, run the
      following commands in your shell:

      .. code-block:: bash

         export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access key ID>
         export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret access key>
         export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<session token>

      If you are not using an AWS session token, omit the line
      that sets the ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` environment variable.

      Set the ``mechanism`` option in your
      ``Credential`` struct to ``AuthMechanism::MongoDbAws``. The driver
      reads your AWS IAM credentials from your environment variables.
      The following code shows how to define a ``Credential`` struct
      with AWS authentication specified and connect to MongoDB:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/auth.rs
         :language: rust
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-aws-env-var
         :end-before: end-aws-env-var

   .. tab:: Web Identity Token File
      :tabid: web-identity-token-file

      You can use the OpenID Connect (OIDC) token obtained from a web
      identity provider to authenticate to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes
      Service (EKS) or other services. To use an OIDC token, create a
      file that contains your token, then define an environment variable
      whose value is the absolute path to the token file as shown in the
      following shell command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         export AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE=<absolute path to OIDC token file>

      Set the ``mechanism`` option in your
      ``Credential`` struct to ``AuthMechanism::MongoDbAws``. The driver
      reads your AWS IAM credentials from the token file.
      The following code shows how to define a ``Credential`` struct
      with AWS authentication specified and connect to MongoDB:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/auth.rs
         :language: rust
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-aws-env-var
         :end-before: end-aws-env-var

.. _rust-auth-x509:

MONGODB-X509 Mechanism
----------------------

The ``MONGODB-X509`` authentication mechanism uses Transport Level Security (TLS)
with X.509 certificates to authenticate your user, which is identified
by the relative distinguished names (RDNs) of your client certificate.

When you specify this authentication mechanism, the server authenticates
the connection by reading the following files:

- A certificate authority (CA) file, which contains one or more
  certificate authorities to trust when making a TLS connection
- A certificate key file, which references the client certificate private key

To specify the ``MONGODB-X509`` authentication mechanism, set the
``mechanism`` field of your ``Credential`` struct to
``AuthMechanism::MongoDbX509``. This example specifies the
authentication mechanism by using the following placeholders:

- ``path to CA certificate``: The filepath for your CA file
- ``path to private client key``: The filepath for your certificate key file
- ``password for client key``: The password used to decrypt the client key
- ``db``: The authentication database associated with the user

The following code shows how to reference your certificates in your
connection string, specify the ``MONGODB-X509`` authentication mechanism, and
connect to MongoDB:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/auth.rs
   :language: rust
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-x509
   :end-before: end-x509

.. tip::
