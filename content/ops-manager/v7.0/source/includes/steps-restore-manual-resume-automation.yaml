  At this point, the data files in the replica set are in a consistent 
  state, but the replica set configuration needs to be updated so that 
  each node is aware of each other.
  
  Run the following command:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo -u mongod <path/to/target_mongod_binary> -f /path/to/datafiles/automation-mongod.conf

  The following example restarts all nodes with the version 4.4.12 
  enterprise with the data path ``/data6/node3``:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo -u mongod /var/lib/mongodb-mms-automation/mongodb-linux-x86_64-4.4.12-ent/bin/mongod -f /data6/node3/automation-mongod.conf

  To manage the replica set with automation again,
  :doc:`import the replica set 
  </tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes>`
  back into |mms|.

  On the :guilabel:`Deployment` page, click :guilabel:`Add`, select 
  :guilabel:`Existing MongoDB Deployment`, and proceed with adding 
  :guilabel:`Automation` back to your cluster.
