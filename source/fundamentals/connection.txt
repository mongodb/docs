This guide shows you how to connect to a MongoDB instance or replica set
deployment using the driver.

For information about authenticating with a MongoDB instance,
see :doc:`Authentication </fundamentals/auth>`. To learn more about using
the driver with the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), see
:doc:`JNDI <fundamentals/connection/jndi>`. To configure TLS/SSL security
for connections to your MongoDB instance, see :doc:`TLS/SSL
<fundamentals/connection/tls>`.

.. _mongoclient:

MongoClient
-----------

Use the ``MongoClients.create()`` method to construct a
``MongoClient``. As each ``MongoClient`` represents a threadsafe pool of
connections to the database, most applications only require a single
instance of a ``MongoClient``, even across multiple threads. All resource
usage limits, such as max connections, apply to individual
``MongoClient`` instances.

.. note::

   Always call ``MongoClient.close()`` to clean up resources when an
   instance is no longer needed. The `try-with-resources statement
   <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html>`__
   provides a convenient pattern to guarantee that a ``MongoClient``
   is always closed.

.. _connection-uri:

Connection String
--------------

The **connection string** (also known as a **connection uri**) provides
instructions on how to connect to a MongoDB deployment. The driver
interprets the connection string to determine where and how
it should connect to MongoDB as well as how to behave while
connected. The following example shows each part of the connection URI:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/connection_string_parts.png

In this example, for the protocol, we use ``mongodb+srv`` which specifies the
:manual:`DNS Seedlist Connection Format
</reference/connection-string/#dns-seedlist-connection-format>`. This indicates
that the hostname following it corresponds to the DNS SRV record of your
MongoDB instance or deployment. If your instance or deployment does not have a
DNS SRV record, use ``mongodb`` to specify the :manual:`Standard Connection
Format </reference/connection-string/#standard-connection-string-format>`.

.. note::

   If your deployment is on MongoDB Atlas, follow the
   :atlas:`Atlas driver connection guide <driver-connection?jmp=docs_driver_java>`
   to retrieve your connection string.

The next part of the connection string contains your username and password
if you are using password-based authentication. Replace the value of ``user``
with your username and ``pass`` with your password. If you are using an
authentication mechanism that does not require a username and password, omit
this part of the connection URI.

The next part of the connection string specifies the hostname or IP address and
port of your MongoDB instance. In the example below, we use ``sample-hostname``
as the hostname and ``27017`` as the port. Replace these values to point to
your MongoDB instance.

The last part of the connection string contains connection and authentication
options as parameters. In the example below, we set two connection options:
``retryWrites=true`` and ``w=majority``. For more information on connection
options, skip to the :ref:`connection options <connection-options>` section.

The code below shows how you can use the sample connection URI in a client to
connect to MongoDB.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/srv.java
   :language: java

.. _connect-replica-set:

Connect to a Replica Set
------------------------

A MongoDB replica set deployment is a group of connected instances that
store the same set of data. This configuration of instances provides data
redundancy and high data availability.

To connect to a replica set deployment, specify the hostname (or IP address)
and port numbers of one or more members of the replica set separated by commas.
Use the  to specify the name
of the replica set with which your application is connecting. When the
replica set option is specified, the driver assumes that your
connection string uses a seed list of multiple hosts instead of a single
``host:port`` configuration.

The connection string below specifies three hosts in the cluster and
replica set named "myRs".

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017

.. note::

   Although it is possible to connect to a replica set deployment by
   providing only a single host, you should provide the driver with the
   full list to ensure that it is able to connect even if one host fails.

.. note::

   The :manual:`replicaSet option
   </reference/connection-string/#urioption.replicaSet>` is no longer
   necessary to connect to a replica set, since the driver automatically
   detects and handles multiple hosts in the connection string as a
   replica set.

.. _compression:

Compression
-----------

You can compress messages passing between your MongoDB instance and the
driver. MongoDB drivers support up to three different algorithms
depending on release version:

1. `Snappy <https://google.github.io/snappy/>`__: available in MongoDB 3.4 and later.

2. `Zlib <https://zlib.net/>`__: available in MongoDB 3.6 and later.

3. `Zstandard <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/>`__: available in MongoDB 4.2 and later.

You can specify one or more compression algorithms, but the driver uses
the first compressor in the list supported by the connected
MongoDB instance.

.. _enable-compression:

Enable Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enable compression for the connection to your MongoDB instance
in two different ways: through a parameter in your connection string, or
using a method in the ``MongoClientSettings.Builder`` class.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: ConnectionString
      :tabid: connectionstring

      To enable compression with a :java-sync-api:`ConnectionString
      <com/mongodb/ConnectionString.html>`, use the parameter ``compressors``
      in the connection string passed to
      ``MongoClients.create()``. You can specify one or more compression
      algorithms, separating multiple algorithms with commas:

      .. code-block:: java

         ConnectionString connectionString = new ConnectionString("mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>?compressors=snappy,zlib,zstd");
         MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create(connectionString);

      Specify compression algorithms using the following strings:

      - "snappy" for `Snappy <https://google.github.io/snappy/>`__ compression.

      - "zlib" for `Zlib <https://zlib.net/>`__ compression.

      - "zstd" for `Zstandard <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/>`__ compression.

   .. tab:: MongoClientSettings
      :tabid: mongoclientsettings

      To enable compression with :java-sync-api:`MongoClientSettings
      <com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.html>`, pass the
      :java-sync-api:`compressorList()
      <com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.Builder.html#compressorList(java.util.List)>`
      builder method a list of :java-sync-api:`MongoCompressor <com/mongodb/MongoCompressor.html>`
      instances. You can specify one or more compression algorithms in the list:

      .. code-block:: java
         :emphasize-lines: 2-4

         MongoClientSettings settings = MongoClientSettings.builder()
              .compressorList(Arrays.asList(MongoCompressor.createSnappyCompressor(),
                                            MongoCompressor.createZlibCompressor(),
                                            MongoCompressor.createZstdCompressor()))
              .build();
         MongoClient client = MongoClients.create(settings);

.. _compression-dependencies:

Compression Algorithm Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The JDK supports `Zlib <https://zlib.net/>`__ compression natively, but
`Snappy <https://google.github.io/snappy/>`__ and
`Zstandard <https://github.com/facebook/zstd/>`__ depend upon open source
implementations. See 
`snappy-java <https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java>`__ and
`zstd-java <https://github.com/luben/zstd-jni>`__ for details.

.. _connection-options:

Connection Options
------------------

This section explains MongoDB connection and authentication options
supported by the driver. You can pass the connection options as
parameters of the connection URI to specify the behavior of the client.

       exception.

   * - **localThresholdMS**
     - integer
     - When communicating with multiple instances of MongoDB in a replica
       set, the driver will only send requests to a server whose

       by the connected MongoDB instance. Throws an exception on any write
       that does not receive acknowledgment from the connected MongoDB
       instance.

   * - **journal**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that the driver must wait for the connected MongoDB
       instance to group commit to the journal file on disk for all writes.

   * - **w**
     - string or integer
     - Specifies the write concern. For more information on values, see
       the server documentation for the :manual:`w option

       implicitly configures the **safe** option to ``true``.

   * - **wtimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - Specifies a time limit, in milliseconds, for the write concern. For
       more information, see the server documentation for the
       :manual:`wtimeoutMS option
       </reference/connection-string/#urioption.wtimeoutMS>`. Configuring
       this option implicitly configures the **safe** option to ``true``.

   * - **readPreference**
     - string
     - Specifies the read preference. For more information on values, see
       the server documentation for the :manual:`readPreference option
       </reference/connection-string/#urioption.readPreference>`.

   * - **readPreferenceTags**
     - string
     - Specifies the read preference tags. For more information on values, see
       the server documentation for the :manual:`readPreferenceTags option
       </reference/connection-string/#urioption.readPreferenceTags>`.

   * - **maxStalenessSeconds**
     - integer
     - Specifies, in seconds, how stale a secondary can be before the
       driver stops communicating with that secondary. Not providing
       a parameter or explicitly setting it to ``-1`` indicates that there
       should be no staleness check for secondaries. The minimum value is
       either 90 seconds or the heartbeat frequency plus 10 seconds, whichever
       is greater. For more information, see the server documentation for the
       :manual:`maxStalenessSeconds option
       </reference/connection-string/#urioption.maxStalenessSeconds>`.

   * - **authMechanism**
     - string
     - Specifies the authentication mechanism that the driver should
       use if a credential was supplied. By default, the client will pick
       the most secure mechanism available based on the server version.
       For possible values, see the server documentation for the
       :manual:`authMechanism option
       </reference/connection-string/#urioption.authMechanism>`.

   * - **authSource**
     - string
     - Specifies the database that the supplied credentials should be
       validated against. Defaults to ``admin``.

     - Specifies the name of the application provided to MongoDB instances
       during the connection handshake. Can be used for server logs and
       profiling.

   * - **compressors**
     - string
     - Specifies one or more compression algorithms that the driver
       will attempt to use to compress requests sent to the connected
       MongoDB instance. Possible values include: ``zlib``, ``snappy``,
       and ``zstd``.

   * - **zlibCompressionLevel**
     - integer
     - Specifies the degree of compression that `Zlib <https://zlib.net/>`__
       should employ to decrease the size of requests to the connected
       MongoDB instance. The level can range from ``-1`` to ``9``, with
       lower values compressing faster (but resulting in larger requests)
       and larger values compressing slower (but resulting in smaller
       requests).

   * - **retryWrites**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that the driver must retry supported write operations
       if they fail due to a network error. Defaults to true.

   * - **retryReads**

       if they fail due to a network error. Defaults to true.

   * - **uuidRepresentation**
     - string
     - Specifies the UUID representation to use for read and write
       operations. For more information, see the the driver documentation
       for the :java-sync-api:`MongoClientSettings.getUuidRepresentation() method
       <com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.html#getUuidRepresentation()>`.

   * - **directConnection**
     - boolean
     - Specifies that the driver must connect to the host directly.

For a complete list of options, see the :java-sync-api:`ConnectionString
<com/mongodb/ConnectionString.html>` API reference page.
