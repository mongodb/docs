External IP Address of the Migration Host in Cloud Manager
------------------------------------------------------------

Before you begin the live migration procedure, add the IP addresses or
|cidr| blocks of your migration hosts to the project
:ref:`IP access list <access-list>`. |service| allows connections to the
destination {+cluster+} only from hosts with entries in the project's
access list.
