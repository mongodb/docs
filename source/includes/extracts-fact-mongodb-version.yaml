   |service| supports MongoDB 3.2 and MongoDB 3.4 with the
   :ref:`WiredTiger storage engine <storage-wiredtiger>`. You can
   specify the MongoDB version when you :doc:`create a cluster
   <create-new-cluster>`. If a created cluster uses MongoDB 3.2, you
   can upgrade to MongoDB 3.4 when you :doc:`scale a cluster
   <scale-cluster>`. By default, |service| uses MongoDB 3.2 except for
   |service| Free Tier. |service| Free Tier clusters deploy with
   MongoDB 3.4. For more information, see :ref:`atlas-free-tier`.

   As new maintenance releases become available, |service|
   automatically upgrades to these releases via a rolling process to
   maintain cluster availability.
