   to improve performance.

#. Convert the data to vector embeddings.

   an :term:`embedding model`. To learn more, 
   see :ref:`create-vector-embeddings`.

#. Store the data and embeddings in |service|.

   Store these embeddings in |service|. You store embeddings 
   as a field alongside other data in your collection.
