========================================
Migrate or Import Data into Your Cluster
========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can bring data from existing MongoDB deployments, ``JSON``, or ``CSV`` files
into |service| using either live migration tools where |service| assists you, or
tools for a self-guided migration of data into |service|.

:doc:`migration-to-atlas-choosing`
   Choose between different tools for data import and migration based on
   common cluster configurations.

:doc:`migration-live-atlas-managed`
   Use the |service|-managed tools to bring data into |service|.
   |service| guides you through the process and ensures the migration
   can proceed only when all conditions are met.

:doc:`migration-self-managed`
   Use |mongomirror|, |mongorestore|, |mongoimport|, or
   :compass:`MongoDB Compass </import-export/>`,
   to bring data into |service|. With these tools, you manage the migration
   process outside of |service|.
