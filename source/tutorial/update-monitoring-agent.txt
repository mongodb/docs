Update the Monitoring Agent
===========================

Collection Interval Considerations
----------------------------------

When the Monitoring agent restarts, there is a five minute delay
before that agent begins collecting data sending pings to
|monitoring|. If you have multiple agents, this delay permits other
agents in your infrastructure to become the primary agent and for
|monitoring| to determine which agent will be primary.

During this interval, the restarted Monitoring agent will not
collect data.
