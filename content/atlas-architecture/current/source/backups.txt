|service-fullname| provides fully managed and customizable backups to
ensure data retention and recovery: 

- Cloud Backups: Supports full-copy snapshots and localized snapshot
  storage using your cloud provider's native snapshot capabilities.
  These snapshots are always incremental in nature for low cost and fast
  restores. You choose a backup policy that specifies the frequency and
  retention period of hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly
  snapshots.
- Continuous Cloud Backups: Enhances standard cloud backups by offering
  Point In Time (PIT) recovery. This additive feature stores snapshots
  along with the cluster's oplog to capture data changes between
  snapshots, enabling you to recover your data to the exact moment (a
  point in time) right before any failure or event. This supports
  Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) as low as 1 minute.

We don't recommend enabling backup for development and test
environments. For staging and production environments, we recommend
developing automated deployment templates that include the
backup policy recommendations described in this page. 

Features for {+service+} Backups
--------------------------------

|service| provides fully-managed backups of your data, including
point-in-time data recovery and consistent, cluster-wide snapshots of
all clusters, including sharded clusters. In |service|, you can
choose from five snapshot frequencies, each with its own retention
period: hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 20 80 
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Cloud Backups
     - This feature provides localized backup storage using the native
       snapshot functionality of your cluster's cloud service provider.
       Benefits include a strong default backup retention schedule of 12
       months, full flexibility to customize snapshot and retention
       schedules, and the ability to set different snapshot frequencies
       (such as hourly for recovery, weekly or monthly for long-term
       retention) to meet industry regulations. You can access your
       backup data instantly, which is useful for auditing, compliance,
       or data recovery purposes.

   * - Continuous Cloud Backups
     - This feature can be enabled on top of Cloud Backups to provide
       Point In Time (PIT) recovery. Continuous Cloud Backups work by
       storing snapshots along with the cluster's oplog up to a
       customizable Point In Time Restore (PITr) window, enabling you to
       restore to the last snapshot and then replay all operations since
       the snapshot was taken. This allows you to recover your data to
       the exact moment (a point in time) right before any failure or
       data loss event, like a cyber attack.

   * - Multi-region Snapshot Distribution
     - This feature allows you to increase resilience by distributing
       copies of backup snapshots and oplogs across geographic regions
       in addition to the default primary region. This configuration
       meets compliance requirements of storing backups in different
       geographical locations to ensure disaster recovery in case of
       regional outages.

       To learn more, see :atlas:`Snapshot Distribution </backup/cloud-backup/snapshot-distribution/>`.

   * - Backup Compliance Policy 
     - This feature further secures business critical data by preventing
       all snapshots and oplogs stored in {+service+} from being
       modified or deleted, guaranteeing that your backups are fully
       WORM (Write Once Read Many) compliant. Only a designated,
       authorized user can turn off this protection after completing a
       verification process with MongoDB support. There is a mandatory
       cooldown period to disable this feature so that an attacker
       cannot change the backup policy and export the data.

       To learn more, see `Configure a Backup Compliance Policy <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/backup/cloud-backup/backup-compliance-policy/>`__.

Recommendations for {+service+} Backups
---------------------------------------

Recommendations for Backup Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must align your backup strategy with specific Recovery Point
Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) to meet business
continuity requirements, particularly for critical applications where
near-zero {+rpo+} and rapid recovery times are crucial. {+rpo+}
defines the maximum amount of data loss acceptable during a failure or
disruption, while {+rto+} defines the maximum amount of time it takes
for your cluster or service to recover. You must calculate your
standards for {+rpo+} and {+rto+} based on the criticality of your
application. For example, mission-critical data typically requires a
lower {+rpo+} than clickstream analytics.

The nature of your disaster scenario and your method of recovery affects
your achievable {+rpo+} and {+rto+}. The default high availability architecture
in MongoDB supports automatic failover to recover from temporary cloud
provider outages with a near-zero {+rto+} and {+rpo+}, depending on the
scope of the outage and your chosen deployment paradigm. To learn more
about deployment configurations that support automatic failover, see
:ref:`arch-center-high-availability`.

For disaster scenarios that require you to restore from backup, such as
a code error that corrupts your entire database or an accidental cluster deletion,
your deployment's {+rto+} and {+rpo+} depend on the following:

- {+rpo+} depends on the snapshot interval defined in your backup
  policy. When Continuous Cloud Backups is disabled, your {+rpo+}
  directly corresponds to the amount of time between snapshots. If you
  take backup snapshots every four hours, for example, then you can lose
  up to four hours of data during a failure event. If you enable
  Continuous Cloud Backups, then you can perform {+pit+} restores that
  guarantee an {+rpo+} as low as one minute within your customizable
  {+pitr+} window. 
- {+rto+} depends on the size of your backup and the efficiency of your
  restore operation. Large replica sets (and shards) take longer to
  restore. To speed up restores, {+service+} automatically performs
  optimized direct attach restores for clusters that are based in the
  same project and regions where you store snapshot copies. 
  
  If there is no local snapshot available, or if the cluster uses NVMe storage
  instead of standard General or Low CPU storage, then {+service+}
  defaults to slower streaming restores.
  
  Additionally, if you enable Continuous Cloud Backups, then {+service+} must replay operations after restoring to the last snapshot in order to complete a {+pit+}
  restore. The less time between snapshots, the fewer operations must be
  replayed. Therefore, you can lower your {+rto+} by prioritizing
  optimized restores and requiring more frequent snapshots in your
  backup policy. 

To ensure a comprehensive backup strategy, we recommend using the following
default backup policy as a starting point. Adjust this policy according
to your business's data retention and disaster recovery needs.

.. _atlas-backup-distribution:

Recommendations for Backup Distribution 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To further enhance resilience in a single-region deployment, we recommend
that you configure {+service+} to copy snapshots from the primary
region to a secondary backup region to ensure that you can still restore
to previous versions if the primary region goes down. To learn more,
see :ref:`snapshot-distribution`.

.. _atlas-backup-compliance:

Recommendations for Backup Compliance Policy 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend enforcing {+service+}'s `Backup Compliance Policy
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/backup/cloud-backup/backup-compliance-policy/>`__
to prevent unauthorized modifications or deletions of backups, thereby
ensuring data protection and robust disaster recovery. 

Recommendations for PIT Recovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Continuous Cloud Backups enable precise Point In Time (PIT) recovery,
which minimizes data loss during failures. {+service+} can quickly
recover to the exact timestamp before a failure event, guaranteeing at
least a one minute {+rpo+}. This is because {+service+} restores the
most recent snapshot from before the desired point in time and then
replays the oplog changes to restore to that particular point.
Recovery times can vary due to cloud provider disk warming and how
much of the oplog must replay during recovery. Your cluster
performance might be slow until the cloud provider disk warming
completes after a restore. If you can be flexible in your requirements
for recovery, we recommend designing templates that identify the best
compromise between reasonable recovery options and cost. 

Recommendations for Backup Costs 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To optimize {+service+} backup costs, you can adjust backup frequency and
retention policies to align with data criticality and reduce unnecessary
storage expenses. For example, we recommend that you disable backups in
lower environments, such as development or test clusters where data
recovery is not critical. For upper environments, we recommend balancing
cross-region data transfer costs against high availability requirements
when distributing backup snapshots across regions. 

Automation Examples: {+service+} Backups
----------------------------------------

The following examples enable backup and restore operations using |service|
:ref:`tools for automation <arch-center-automation>`.

These examples apply only for staging and production environments where
backup is enabled for the cluster.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: CLI
      :tabid: cli

      Run the following command to take a backup snapshot for the cluster
      named myDemo and retain the snapshot for 7 days:

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli/cli-example-backup-take-snapshot.rst

      Enable backup compliance policy for your project with a
      designated, authorized user (``governance@example.org``) who alone can turn
      off this protection after completing a verification process with
      MongoDB support. 

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli/cli-example-backup-compliance-policy-enable.rst

      Run the following command to create a compliance policy for
      scheduled backup snapshots that enforces the number of times
      snapshots must be taken, which is set to every ``6`` hours, and
      the duration for retaining the snapshots, which is set to ``1``
      month.   

      .. include:: /includes/examples/cli/cli-example-backup-compliance-policy-schedule.rst

   .. tab:: Terraform
      :tabid: Terraform
 
      The following examples demonstrate how to configure backups during
      deployment. Before you can create resources with Terraform,
      you must:  

      - :ref:`Create your paying organization <configure-paying-org>`
        and :ref:`create an API key <atlas-admin-api-access>` for the
        paying organization. Store your API key as environment variables
        by running the following command in the terminal: 

        .. code-block::

           export MONGODB_ATLAS_PUBLIC_KEY="<insert your public key here>"
           export MONGODB_ATLAS_PRIVATE_KEY="<insert your private key here>"

      - `Install Terraform <https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli>`__.
