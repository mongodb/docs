The administration documentation addresses the ongoing operation and
maintenance of MongoDB instances and deployments. This documentation
includes both high level overviews of these concerns as well as
tutorials that cover specific procedures and processes for operating
MongoDB.

.. note::

   For a simple way to run, monitor, and maintain cloud-hosted MongoDB
   deployments, try `MongoDB Atlas
   <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?utm_source=administration&utm_campaign=20-docs-in-20-days&utm_medium=docs>`_.

   If you have an existing MongoDB database and are looking to decrease the
   administrative burden, you can learn how to migrate it into Atlas `here
   <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/migrate?utm_source=administration&utm_campaign=20-docs-in-20-days-migrations&utm_medium=docs>`_.
