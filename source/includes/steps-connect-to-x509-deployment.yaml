  Save the following ConfigMap as ``x509-mongodb-user.yaml``:

  .. code-block:: none
     :linenos:

     ---
     apiVersion: mongodb.com/v1
     kind: MongoDBUser
     metadata:
       name: new-x509-user
     spec:
       username: "CN=my-x509-authenticated-user, OU=organizationalunit, O=organization"
       db: "$external"
       project: my-project
       roles:
         - db: "admin"
           name: "clusterAdmin"

  This ConfigMap ``.yaml`` file describes a ``MongoDBUser`` custom object. You
  can use these custom objects to create MongoDB users.
  
  In this example, the ConfigMap describes the user as an X.509
  user that the client can use to connect to MongoDB with the
  corresponding X.509 certificate.

  Run the following command to apply the ConfigMap and create the
  X.509 MongoDB user:

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl -n {namespace} apply -f x509-mongodb-user.yaml

  You should see an output similar to the following:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     mongodbuser.mongodb.com/new-x509-user created

  Run the following command to check the state of the ``new-x509-user``:

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl -n {namespace} get mdbu/new-x509-user -o yaml

  You should see an output similar to the following:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     NAME            CREATED AT
     new-x509-user   8m

  Once you have created your X.509 user, try to connect to the
  deployment using the mongo Shell:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongo --host {host} --ssl --sslCAFile /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt --sslPEMKeyFile x509-full.pem --authenticationMode MONGODB-X509

  .. note::

     On Kubernetes Pods, the |certauth| file is saved in
     ``/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt``, which
     is the file location used for the ``--sslCAFile`` connection
     option.
