Description
-----------

.. method:: convertShardKeyToHashed(<Object>)

   Returns the hashed value for the input. The
   :method:`convertShardKeyToHashed()` method uses the same hashing
   function as the hashed index and can be used to see what the
   :doc:`hashed value </core/hashed-sharding>` would be for a key.

Compatibility
-------------

This method is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

.. note::

   If your deployment uses a MongoDB version less than v6.0, 
   ``convertShardKeyToHashed`` may have additional permissions requirements.

Example
-------

Consider a sharded collection that uses a :doc:`hashed shard key
</core/hashed-sharding>` [#populated]_

.. code-block:: javascript

   use test

   db.orders.createIndex( { _id: "hashed" } )

   sh.shardCollection( "test.orders", { _id : "hashed" } )

If the following document exists in the collection, the hashed value of
the ``_id`` field is used to distribute the document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: ObjectId("5b2be413c06d924ab26ff9ca"),
     "item" : "Chocolates",
     "qty" : 25
   }
   

To determine the hashed value of ``_id`` field used to distribute the
document across the shards, you can use the
:method:`convertShardKeyToHashed` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   convertShardKeyToHashed( ObjectId("5b2be413c06d924ab26ff9ca") )

.. [#populated]

   If the collection already contains data, you must create a hashed
   index on the shard key before you shard the collection. For an empty
   collection, MongoDB creates the index as part of
   :method:`sh.shardCollection()`.
