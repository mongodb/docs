==========
No Primary
==========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Description
-----------

At time ``T``, no :term:`primary` was detected in replica set ``ABC``.

Common Triggers
---------------

- A network partition is preventing all members of the replica set from
  communicating with each other.

- There are not enough voting members in the replica set to keep a
  primary. A simple majority is required to have a primary. This can
  happen if too many hosts are down (or not responding) to replica set
  heartbeats.

- There is not an electable member when the primary goes down.

Possible Solutions
------------------

- Ensure a majority of votes are available in the replica set. If hosts
  have been shut down permanently, ensure they are removed from the
  replica set configuration.

- Use basic ping tests from one host to another to ensure they can
  communicate with each other

- Make sure there is more than one data bearing member with a priority
  greater than 0.
