Overview
--------

A global alert applies the same :doc:`alert configuration
</tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>` to multiple groups at once. When
an alert condition occurs, |onprem| sends notification only to the
affected group. |onprem| sends notification at regular intervals until the
alert :ref:`resolves <resolved-alert>` or gets :ref:`canceled
<cancelled-alert>`.

If you acknowledge a global alert, |onprem| sends no further notifications to
the alertâ€™s distribution list until the acknowledgement period has passed or
until the alert resolves. If the alert condition ends during the
acknowledgment period, |onprem| sends a notification of the resolution.

To access global alerts you must have the
:ref:`global-monitoring-admin-role` role or :ref:`global-owner-role` role.
