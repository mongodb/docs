Overview
--------

To modify your deployment through the Public API you update your group's
:doc:`automation configuration </reference/cluster-configuration>`. The
automation configuration determines the goal state of the group's databases
and agents. The Automation Agent on each server works to achieve the goal
state for the items running on its server.

To modify the automation configuration you retrieve the current configuration,
make your changes, and then use ``PUT`` to replace the entire configuration.
You must take care to change only those items you want modified and to leave
the rest as is.

To update, you must use ``PUT``. **Do not use** ``PATCH``.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must have access to the Public API. For more information, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-public-api-access`.
