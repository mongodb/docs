The ``concurrent`` option enables intra-query parallelism. In this mode,
|fts| utilizes more resources, but improves each individual query
latency. This feature is only available for :ref:`dedicated Search Nodes
<what-is-search-node>`.

``concurrent`` Option Limitations
---------------------------------

When you run queries with the ``concurrent`` option, |fts| doesn't
guarantee that each query will be executed concurrently. For example,
when too many concurrent queries are queued, |fts| might fallback to
single-threaded execution. 

Syntax 
------

``concurrent`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 7

   {
     "$searchMeta"|"$search": {  
       "index": "<index name>", // optional, defaults to "default"
       "<operator>": { 
         <operator-specifications>
       },
       "concurrent": true | false,
       ...
     }
   }

Behavior 
--------

The ``concurrent`` boolean option allows you to request |fts| to
parallelize query execution across segments, which, in many cases, 
improves the response time. You can set one of the following values for 
the ``concurrent`` option:
 
- ``true`` - to request |fts| to run the query multi-threaded 
- ``false`` - to run the query single-threaded (default)

|fts| provides you control over this behavior on a per-query basis
to enable concurrent execution only for heavy and long-running queries,
which minimizes the contention and improves overall query throughput.
Concurrent execution is especially efficient on large datasets, as there
is a larger amount of segments.

Example 
-------

Consider the following query against the :ref:`sample_mflix.movies 
<sample-mflix>` collection in the sample data. The query indicates a
concurrent search for movies that contain the term ``new york`` in the
``title``. 

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true 
   :linenos: 
   :emphasize-lines: 8

   db.movies.aggregate([
     {
       "$search": {
         "text": {
           "path": "title",
           "query": "new york"
         },
         "concurrent": true
       }
     }
   ])
