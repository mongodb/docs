==================
Security Checklist
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Security is a process of reducing risk exposure and protect access to
resources. MongoDB provides a collection of tools that allow
administrators to actively reduce risk and protect a MongoDB
deployment. This document outlines, from a high level

Require Authentication
----------------------

If you set :setting:`auth` to ``true``, MongoDB will require all
clients to successfully authenticate before allowing access to the
system.

See :doc:`/core/authentication` and
:doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication` for more information.

Implement a Policy of Least Privilege
-------------------------------------

Ensure that all clients who authenticate to MongoDB have only the
access needed to perform required operations. MongoDB
provides a role-based privilege system that allows administrators to
grant users very granular access to specific operations and
resources.

See :doc:`/core/authorization` for more information.

Audit System Activity
---------------------

MongoDB Enterprise includes a system auditing facility that can record
any system event (e.g. user operations, connection events) on a
MongoDB instance. These audit records permit forensic analysis and
allow administrators to verify proper controls.

See :doc:`/core/auditing` and :doc:`/tutorial/configure-auditing` for
more information.

Encrypt Communication
---------------------

MongoDB provides SSL connections for all incoming and outgoing
connections. Use SSL to encrypt communication between
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` components of a MongoDB
client, as well as between all applications and MongoDB.

See :doc:`/tutorial/configure-ssl` for more information.

Limit Network Exposure
----------------------

Ensure that MongoDB runs in a trusted network environment and limit
the interfaces that MongoDB instances listen for incoming
connections. Only trusted clients should be able to access the network
interfaces and ports on which MongoDB instances are available.

See :setting:`bind_ip`, :doc:`configure-linux-iptables-firewall`, and
:doc:`configure-windows-netsh-firewall` for more information.

Disable Unused Interfaces
-------------------------

MongoDB provides interfaces that may provide too much access to your
MongoDB deployment. Unless you need these interfaces, disable them in
production environments.

Set :setting:`nohttpinterface` to ``true`` and do not enable
:setting:`rest`.
