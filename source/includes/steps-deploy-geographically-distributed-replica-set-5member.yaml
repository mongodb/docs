title: "Start each member of the replica set with the appropriate options."
level: 4
ref: start-mongod
content: |

   For each member, start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance with the
   following settings:

   - Set :setting:`replication.replSetName` option to the replica set name,

     .. include:: /includes/fact-unique-replica-set-names.rst

   - Set :setting:`net.bindIp` option to the hostname/ip address or a
     comma-delimited list of hostnames/ip addresses, and

   - Set any other settings as appropriate for your deployment.

   In this tutorial, the five :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances are
   associated with the following hosts:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Replica Set Member
        - Hostname

      * - Member 0
        - ``mongodb0.example.net``

      * - Member 1
        - ``mongodb1.example.net``

      * - Member 2
        - ``mongodb2.example.net``

      * - Member 3
        - ``mongodb3.example.net``

      * - Member 4
        - ``mongodb4.example.net``

   The following example specifies the replica set name and the ip
   binding through the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` and :option:`--bind_ip <mongod --bind_ip>`
   command-line options:

   .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

   .. code-block:: bash

      mongod --replSet "rs0" --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

   For ``<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>``, specify the hostname(s) and/or
   ip address(es) for your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that remote
   clients (including the other members of the replica set) can use to
   connect to the instance.

   Alternatively, you can also specify the :setting:`replica set name
   <replication.replSetName>` and the :setting:`hostnames/ip
   addresses <net.bindIp>` in a
   :doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>`:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      replication:
         replSetName: "rs0"
      net:
         bindIp: localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

   To start :binary:`~bin.mongod` with a configuration file, specify the
   configuration file's path with the :option:`--config <mongod
   --config>` option:
         
   .. code-block:: bash

      mongod --config <path-to-config>

   In production deployments, you can configure a :term:`init script`
   to manage this process. Init scripts are beyond the scope of this
   document.

title: Optional. Configure the member eligibility for becoming primary.
stepnum: 5
level: 4
ref: verify-priority
pre: |
  In some cases, you may prefer that the members in one data center be
  elected primary before the members in the other data centers. You can
  modify the :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` of the members such that the
  members in the one data center has higher
  :rsconf:`~members[n].priority` than the members in the other data
  centers.

  Some members of the replica set, such as members that have networking
  restraint or limited resources, should not be able to become primary
  in a :term:`failover`. Configure members that should not become
  primary to have :ref:`priority 0
  <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`.

  For example, to lower the relative eligibility of the member
  located in one of the sites (in this example,
  ``mongodb2.example.net``), set the member's priority to ``0.5``.

action:
  - pre: |
      .. include:: /includes/fact-distributed-rs-siteB-config.rst
  - pre: |
      After these commands return, you have a geographically redundant
      five-member replica set.
