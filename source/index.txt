What is |ak8so|?
----------------

|ak8so| is a new service that integrates |service| resources with your
|k8s| {+cluster+}. You can now deploy and manage the lifecycle of your 
cloud-native applications that need data services in a single control 
plane with secure enterprise platform integration.

To learn more, see :ref:`ak8so-quick-start-ref`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-crds.rst

What Can You Do?
----------------

You can use |ak8so| to manage resources in |service| without leaving
|k8s|. You deploy |ak8so| into |k8s| {+clusters+}. |ak8so| 
manages resources in |service| based on |k8s| :ref:`custom resources 
<custom-resources>`. It ensures that the state of the projects, 
{+database-deployments+}, and database users in |service| matches the 
configurations in each :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`,
:ref:`atlasdeployment-custom-resource`, and 
:ref:`atlasdatabaseuser-custom-resource` that you 
create in your |k8s| {+cluster+}.

|ak8so| supports many advanced features within the 
:ref:`custom-resources`, such as :ref:`X509 authentication 
<ak8so-x509>`, :ref:`private endpoints in Azure and AWS 
<ak8so-private-endpoint>`, and 
:ref:`advanced multi-cloud and multi-region clusters 
<ak8so-advanced-clusters>`.

.. _deletion-protection:

New Default: Deletion Protection in |ak8so| 2.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------

By default with |ak8so|, custom resources you delete in |k8s| are no longer deleted in 
|service|. Instead, |ak8so| simply stops managing those resources. 

For example, if you delete an :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource` 
in |k8s|, |ak8so| no longer automatically deletes the corresponding project 
from |service|, preventing accidental or unexpected deletions. This applies to 
all :ref:`objects managed using custom resources <custom-resources>`. 

You can :ref:`revert this behavior <revert-deletion-protection>` to the default 
used prior to |ak8so| 2.0 for your entire deployment or for specific custom 
resources or subobjects. 

Use the following tables to determine 
the correct behavior for your deployment:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Deletion Protection
     - No Deletion Protection

   * - New default as of |ak8so| 2.0
     - Default prior to |ak8so| 2.0

   * - If you delete a custom resource or objects from a custom resource,
       the corresponding objects remain in |service| but |ak8so| no longer
       manages them. You can manage objects decoupled from |ak8so| only
       from another interface, such as the {+atlas-ui+}.
     - If you delete a custom resource or objects from a custom resource,
       |ak8so| deletes the corresponding objects in |service|, even objects 
       deployed prior to using |ak8so|. Changes to a
       custom resource overwrite changes in |service| made using another
       interface, such as the {+atlas-ui+}.

.. _revert-deletion-protection:

Revert New Deletion Protection Default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can control the new deletion protection behavior using the 
``--object-deletion-protection`` flag or the 
``OBJECT_DELETION_PROTECTION`` environment 
variable in the |k8s| 
:github:`Deployment resource <mongodb/mongodb-atlas-kubernetes/blob/main/deploy/all-in-one.yaml#L4028>` that you applied when installing |ak8so|. 
This flag and environment variable all default to ``true``. 
Set to ``false`` to revert to the behavior prior to |ak8so| 2.1. 

You can also control which behavior to use for individual custom resources using 
the ``atlas-resource-policy`` annotations described in :ref:`ak8so-annotations`.
