.. pipeline:: $https

The :pipeline:`$https` stage specifies a connection in the 
:ref:`Connection Registry <manage-spi-connection-add>` to send
``HTTPS`` requests to. Each time a prior stage passes a document to
``$https``, the stage sends a new request.

.. _atlas-sp-agg-https-syntax:

Syntax
~~~~~~

To send an ``HTTPS`` request to a given connection:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "$https": {
      "connectionName": "<registered-connection>",
      "path" : "<subpath>" | <expression>,
      "parameters" : {
        "<key1>" : "<val1>",
	      . . .
	      "<keyn>" : "<valn>"
      },
      "method" : "<GET | POST | PUT | PATCH | DELETE>",
      "headers" : {
        "<key1>" : "<val1>",
        . . .
        "<keyn>" : "<valn>"
      },
      "as" : "response",
      "onError" : "<DLQ | Ignore | Fail>",
      "payload" : [{
        <inner-pipeline>
      }],
      "config" : {
        "connectionTimeoutSec" : <integer>,
	      "requestTimeoutSec" : <integer>
      } 
    }
  }

The ``$https`` stage takes a document with the following fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 15 20

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description

   * - ``connectionName`` 
     - string
     - Required
     - Label that identifies the connection in the
       :ref:`Connection Registry <manage-spi-connection-add>` to 
       send an ``HTTPS`` request to.

   * - ``path``
     - string | expression 
     - Optional
     - Path to append to the URL your ``connectionName`` resolves to.

       For example, if you specify a ``connectionName`` that resolves
       to ``https://sample.com``, you can specify a ``path`` of
       ``"endpoint"`` to have your stream processor send ``HTTPS``
       requests to ``https://sample.com/endpoint``.

       If you define ``path`` as an expression, that expression must
       evaluate to a string.

       The API endpoint that you call should be idempotent.

   * - ``parameters``
     - document
     - Optional 
     - Document containing key-value pairs to pass as parameters to
       your API endpoint call. Each key must be a string, and each
       value must evaluate to either a numeric, string, or boolean value.
       This field supports :manual:`expressions </reference/operator/aggregation/#std-label-aggregation-expressions>`
       as values.
     
   * - ``method``
     - string 
     - Optional
     - HTTPS request method for your connection. Must be one of the following values:

       - ``"GET"``
       - ``"POST"``
       - ``"PUT"``
       - ``"PATCH"``
       - ``"DELETE"``

       Defaults to ``"GET"``.

   * - ``headers``
     - document
     - Optional
     - Document containing key-value pairs to pass as headers to
       the API endpoint. Each key must be a string, and each
       value must evaluate to a string. This field supports 
       :manual:`expressions </reference/operator/aggregation/#std-label-aggregation-expressions>`
       as values.

       If the API endpoint requires authentication, such as an API key or 
       Bearer Access Token authentication, you should add
       authentication details as headers when you define the connection to prevent
       providing these as plaintext as part of this operator.

       Invalid HTTP header names and values are not sent to the API endpoint. Instead,
       these are ignored.

       To learn more about invalid HTTP headers, see `RFC 9110 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-field-values>`__.

       If an expression in a value fails or evaluates to a type other than string, 
       the message is sent to the :term:`dead letter queue` and the operator doesn't
       send this request to the API endpoint.

   * - ``as``
     - string
     - Required
     - Name of the field for the REST API response.

       If the endpoint returns 0 bytes, the operator doesn't set the ``as`` field.

       The operator supports responses with a ``Content-Type`` of ``application/json`` 
       or ``text/plain``. If the API endpoint returns a response with a different
       ``Content-Type``, the operator handles the document based on the ``onError``
       behavior you define.

       If the API endpoint returns a response without a defined ``Content-Type``, 
       the operator assumes that the response is ``application/json``.

   * - ``onError``
     - string
     - Optional
     - Behavior when the operator encounters an ``HTTPS``-related
       failure. Must be one of the following values:

       - ``"dlq"`` : Pass the affected document to the :term:`dead letter queue`.
       - ``"ignore"`` : Do nothing with the affected document.
       - ``"fail"`` : Terminate the stream processor on error.

       The operator considers all ``2XX`` HTTP status codes as successes.
       If the operator receives any of the following HTTP status codes
       in response, the operator follows the behavior based on the 
       value you provide in this field:

       - ``400``
       - ``404``
       - ``410``
       - ``413``
       - ``414``
       - ``431``

       The operator considers any other HTTP status code as a ``"fail"`` error.
       For example, if the API endpoint returns a ``500`` HTTP status code,
       the processor enters a failed state and stops.

       ``onError`` does not trigger on errors arising from incorrect
       configuration of the ``$https`` operator itself, such as invalid 
       expressions.

       Defaults to ``"dlq"``.

   * - ``payload``
     - array
     - Optional
     - Custom inner pipeline that allows you to customize the request body sent to the API endpoint. 
       ``payload`` supports the following expressions:

       - ``$project``
       - ``$addFields``
       - ``$replaceRoot``
       - ``$set``

       By default, the entire message is sent to the API endpoint. {+atlas-sp+}
       sends a :manual:`relaxed mode </reference/mongodb-extended-json/>` JSON payload to the API endpoint.

       Invalid HTTP request bodies are not sent to the API endpoint. Instead,
       these are sent to the :term:`dead letter queue`.

       To learn more about invalid HTTP request bodies, see `RFC 9110 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-field-values>`__.
     
   * - ``config``
     - document 
     - Optional
     - Document containing fields that override various default 
       values.

   * - ``config.connectionTimeoutSec`` 
     - integer
     - Optional
     - The time, in seconds, after which a successful ``HTTPS``
       connection times out if it receives no response.

       Defaults to ``30``.
     
   * - ``config.requestTimeoutSec`` 
     - integer
     - Optional 
     - The time, in seconds, after which an ``HTTPS`` request times
       out if it cannot connect.

       Defaults to ``60``.

.. _atlas-sp-agg-https-behavior:

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

:pipeline:`$https` must come after the :pipeline:`$source` stage, and
must come before the :ref:`$emit <streams-agg-pipeline-emit>` or :pipeline:`$merge`
stage. You can use :pipeline:`$https` in :pipeline:`$hoppingWindow` or
:pipeline:`$tumblingWindow` internal pipelines.

.. _atlas-sp-agg-https-examples:

Examples
~~~~~~~~

A streaming data source generates detailed weather reports from
various locations, conformant to the schema of the :ref:`Sample
Weather Dataset <sample-weather>`. The following aggregation has three
stages:

1. The :pipeline:`$source` stage establishes a connection with the
   {+kafka+} broker collecting these reports in a topic named
   ``my_weatherdata``, exposing each record as it is ingested to the
   subsequent aggregation stages. This stage also overrides the name
   of the timestamp field it projects, setting it to
   ``ingestionTime``.

2. For each record from the {+kafka+} broker, the :pipeline:`$https` stage 
   sends a request to an HTTPS weather source defined in the ``https_weather``
   connection. The request uses the ``position.coordinates`` from the record
   in the HTTPS request to gather a seven-day high temperature forecast in degrees Celsius for that location,
   which it adds to the pipeline document in an ``airTemperatureForecast`` field.

3. The :pipeline:`$merge` stage writes the output to an {+service+}
   collection named ``stream`` in the ``sample_weatherstream``
   database. If no such database or collection exist, {+service+}
   creates them.

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true
   
   {
     '$source': {
       connectionName: 'sample_weatherdata',
       topic: 'my_weatherdata',
       tsFieldName: 'ingestionTime'
     }
   },
   { 
     '$https': { 
       connectionName: 'https_weather',
       path: 'forecast',
       parameters: {
         latitude: { $arrayElemAt: ['$$ROOT.position.coordinates', 0 ] },
         longitude: { $arrayElemAt: ['$$ROOT.position.coordinates', 1 ] }
       },
       as: 'airTemperatureForecast'
   },
   {
     '$merge': {
       into: {
        connectionName: 'weatherStreamOutput',
        db: 'sample_weatherstream',
        coll: 'stream'
       }
     }
   }

To view the documents in the resulting ``sample_weatherstream.stream``
collection, connect to your {+service+} cluster and run the following command:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: json

      db.getSiblingDB("sample_weatherstream").stream.find()

   .. output::
