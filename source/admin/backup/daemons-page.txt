This page lists all active :term:`Backup Daemons <Backup Daemon>` and
provides configuration options. |onprem| automatically detects Backup
Daemons and displays them here. You can reconfigure daemons from this
page. Changes can take up to 5 minutes to take effect.

Click :guilabel:`Pre-Configure New Daemon` at the bottom of the page if
you want to add a daemon but do not want it to take new jobs. Type the
``<machine>:<roothead path>`` in the text field above
:guilabel:`Pre-Configure New Daemon`. Click the button to configure the
new Backup Daemon.

For each daemon, the page lists the server name, configuration,
:term:`head <head database>` space used, head space free, the number of
replica sets backed up, the percentage of time the Backup Daemon
Service was busy, and job runtime counts by 1 minute, 10 minutes,
60 minutes, less than or equal to 180 minutes, and greater than 180
minutes.

The page includes the following fields and links to manage and
configure daemons:

   * - Item
     - Action

   * - Show Detailed JSON
     - Click this link to display the Backup Daemon |json|. When the
       |json| displays, the :guilabel:`View raw runtime data` link
       appears following the code to view the raw data.

   * - Move all heads
     - Click this link to move all the Backup Daemon jobs that live on
       this daemon to a new daemon location.

       #. Click the link.
       #. Click the location.
       #. Click :guilabel:`Move all heads`.

   * - Delete Daemon
     - Click this link to delete the Backup Daemon.

   * - Assignment
     - Select this to allow the daemon to process more jobs. If the
       daemon's disk fills, clear this so the host is not overloaded.

   * - Backup Jobs
     - Select this to allow the daemon to process more backup jobs.
       Clear this when performing maintenance on a daemon's host.

   * - Resource Usage
     - Select this to collect data for this daemon. This includes the
       following data for each backup job run on this daemon:

       - project
       - storage that head database uses
       - storage that the snapshot store uses
       - oplog operations

       Navigate to the :ref:`Resource Usage page <resource-usage-page>`
       to review the collected data.

       .. note::

          If this |onprem| instance is running as a dedicated restore
          daemon host, clear this checkbox to ensure the fastest
          possible restore time.

   * - Garbage Collection
     - Select this to allow the daemon to schedule :term:`groom` jobs
       to remove unused blocks and expired snapshots.

       .. note::

          If this |onprem| instance is running as a dedicated restore
          daemon host, clear this checkbox to ensure the fastest
          possible restore time.

   * - Head Disk Type
     - From this menu, select |ssd| or |hdd| storage.

       If you select |ssd|, |mms| sends jobs to this daemon only when:

       - The job generates a volume of oplog data that meets or exceeds
         a threshold of 1 :abbr:`GBph (Gigabytes per hour)`, or
       - |mms| has no available |hdd| daemon to handle the job.

   * - Assignment Labels
     - Type one or more labels that can be used to assign the daemon
       to a specific project.

   * - Number of Workers
     - Type the number of concurrent backup tasks this daemon should
       process at one time.
