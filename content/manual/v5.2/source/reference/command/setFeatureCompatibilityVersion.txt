.. dbcommand:: setFeatureCompatibilityVersion

   Enables or disables the features that persist data incompatible with
   earlier versions of MongoDB. You can only issue the
   :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` against the ``admin``
   database.

Syntax
------

The command takes the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( {
      setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: <version>,
      writeConcern: { wtimeout: <timeout> }
   } )

The values for the ``version`` are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Version
     - Description

   * - ``"5.0"``


     - *Available on MongoDB 5.0 Deployments*

       Enables the :ref:`5.0 features that persist data incompatible
       with MongoDB 4.4 <5.0-compatibility-enabled>`.

       .. include:: /includes/featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

   * - ``"4.4"``


     - *Available on MongoDB 4.4 and 5.0 Deployments*

       Enables the :ref:`4.4 features that persist data incompatible
       with MongoDB 4.2 <4.4-compatibility-enabled>`.

       .. include:: /includes/featureCompatibility-caveat.rst


   * - ``"4.2"``


     - *Available on MongoDB 4.2 and 4.4 Deployments*

       Enables the :ref:`4.2 features that persist data incompatible
       with MongoDB 4.0 <4.2-compatibility-enabled>`.

       .. include:: /includes/featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

       - If set on MongoDB 4.4 deployments,
           Disables the :ref:`4.4 features that persist data
           incompatible with MongoDB 4.2
           <4.4-compatibility-enabled>`.

           Enables the :ref:`4.0 features that persist data incompatible
           with MongoDB 3.6 <4.0-compatibility-enabled>`.

           .. include:: /includes/featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

       - If set on MongoDB 4.2 deployments,
           Disables the :ref:`4.2 features that persist data
           incompatible with MongoDB 4.0
           <4.2-compatibility-enabled>`.

           <3.6-compatibility-enabled>`.

           .. include:: /includes/featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

       - If set on MongoDB 4.0 deployments,
           Disables the :ref:`4.0 features that persist data
           incompatible with MongoDB 3.6
           <4.0-compatibility-enabled>`.


   * - ``"3.4"``

     - *Available on MongoDB 3.4 and MongoDB 3.6 Deployments*

       - If set on MongoDB 3.4 deployments,
           Enables the :ref:`3.4 features that persist data
           incompatible with MongoDB 3.2
           <3.4-compatibility-enabled>`.

           .. include:: /includes/3.4-featureCompatibility-caveat.rst

       - If set on MongoDB 3.6 deployments,
           Disables the :ref:`3.6 features that persist data
           incompatible with MongoDB 3.4
           <3.6-compatibility-enabled>`.

   * - ``"3.2"``

     - *Available on MongoDB 3.4 Deployments*

       Disables the :ref:`3.4 features that persist data
       incompatible with MongoDB 3.2 <3.4-compatibility-enabled>`.

The optional ``writeConcern`` specifies the write concern
:ref:`wc-wtimeout` value in milliseconds:

- The time period that the :term:`primary` waits for
  acknowledgment from the majority of the replica set members. If the
  acknowledgment is not received in the time period, the operation
  fails.

- Default is ``60000`` milliseconds. Use a longer time period if the
  :term:`secondary` members of the replica set have a delay that exceeds
  the :ref:`wc-wtimeout` default.

Behavior
--------

Conflicts with Background Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain background operations may prevent
execution of :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`. Use 
:dbcommand:`currentOp` to identify any ongoing operations.

Default Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/list-table-featureCompatibilityVersion-defaults.rst

Idempotency
~~~~~~~~~~~

This command must perform writes to an internal system collection. If
for any reason the command does not complete successfully, you can
safely retry the command as the operation is idempotent.

Examples
--------

.. _view-fcv:

View FeatureCompatibilityVersion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` for a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance, run the following command on a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance:

.. note::

   The operation is undefined on the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances. For a
   sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the command
   against a member of the shard replica set, you must connect to the
   member as a :ref:`shard local user <shard-local-users>`.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

The output from this command will resemble one of the following,
depending on the current state of the :binary:`~bin.mongod`:

- If the deployment has the default ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, or
  if the :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` command has run
  successfully against the deployment, the
  ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has the form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     "featureCompatibilityVersion" : {
        "version" : <version>
     }

- If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is in a partially upgraded or downgraded
  state, the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     "featureCompatibilityVersion" : {
        "version" : <version> ,
        "targetVersion" : <target version>
     }

  For instance, if a sharded cluster has a shard replica set that is
  read only when you run :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`
  command against the :binary:`~bin.mongos`, the command will fail, and the
  ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of the config servers will include
  the ``targetVersion`` field.

  Or if a replica set becomes read only while
  :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` is running, the command
  will fail, and the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` of the replica set
  will include the ``targetVersion`` field as well.
