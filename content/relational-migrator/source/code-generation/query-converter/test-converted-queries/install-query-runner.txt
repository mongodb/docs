To use the :guilabel:`Test Queries` pane, Relational
Migrator must have access to the Query Runner. 
Query Runner is a Docker container with 
all the dependencies needed to test your converted 
queries.

About this Task
---------------

- If the version of Query Runner is different than the 
  version of {+rel-mig+}, a warning banner displays.
  
- To update Query Runner to the latest version, run 
  the ``docker pull`` command from step number one.

- Query Runner operates using the ``http`` protocol. 
  Requests made from a remote machine are not encrypted.

- Query Runner can run either locally or remotely.

Before you Begin
----------------

Install `Docker <https://www.docker.com/get-started/>`__.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Get the Query Runner Image
      
      .. code-block:: sh

         docker pull public.ecr.aws/v4d7k6c9/relational-migrator-query-runner

   .. step:: Run the Image as a Container

         - To run the container locally:
         
           .. code-block:: sh

              docker run --name relational-migrator-query-runner -p 127.0.0.1:6080:6080 public.ecr.aws/v4d7k6c9/relational-migrator-query-runner

         - To run the container remotely:
                     
           a. Add the server address where the  
              service is running to the ``migrator.language-runner.server.address`` in the 
              ``user.properties``.

              For example:

              .. code-block:: sh

                 migrator.language-runner.server.address: http://myserver:6080 

              .. tip::
                  
                 For details on where the ``user.properties`` file is located, 
                 see :ref:`file-location`. 

           #. After changing the ``user.properties`` file, restart {+rel-mig+}.

           #. Launch the container from your remote server or container hosting service.

              To launch the container on your remote server expose port ``6080`` 
              with the following docker command:

              .. code-block:: sh

                 docker run --name relational-migrator-query-runner -p 6080:6080 public.ecr.aws/v4d7k6c9/relational-migrator-query-runner

   .. step:: Confirm the Query Runner container is running

      In your web browser, navigate to the host and port the Query Runner 
      container is using. For example: 
      `http://localhost:6080/status <http://localhost:6080/status>`__.

      Check the ``status`` field of the JSON data returned from the 
      ``status`` endpoint. A status of ``ok`` means the container is
      running:

      .. code-block:: 
         :copyable: false

         {
         "status":"ok",
         "server":"App Mod Language Runner",
         "commitHash":"159119004c2bf8c534e15e5895acb9bc1bfb5b8d",
         "version":"20240627"
         }
