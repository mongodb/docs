An Agent API key is a unique identifier that the Automation,
Monitoring, and Backup Agents for a project use to authenticate
themselves to |mms|. A project can have multiple Agent API keys. Any of
the project's agents can use any of the Agent API keys associated with
the project.

View Agent API Keys
-------------------

For keys created using the new Agent API Key Model:
   You can manage your Agent API keys from the :guilabel:`Agent API
   Keys` tab. From the :guilabel:`Deployment` view, click on the
   :guilabel:`Agents` tab, and then the :guilabel:`Agent API Keys` tab.

   The tab displays a list of existing Agent API keys. The keys
   themselves are redacted. However, the list displays the description
   and creation details.

Create Agent API Key
--------------------

.. note:: Only the project's owner can create an Agent API key. You can
          generate an Agent API Key while installing an agent if you 
          are the project owner and the project has either no Agent API keys
          or just the Original Group API key.
