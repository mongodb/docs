Dashboards are a collection of charts assembled to create a single
unified display of your data. Each chart shows data from a
single MongoDB collection or view, so dashboards are essential to
attain insight into multiple focal points of your data in a single
display. Dashboards can be shared with other users.

Dashboards Page

The :guilabel:`Dashboards` page shows all dashboards you have access to
view. To learn more about dashboard permissions in |charts|, see

Each dashboard shows the following information:

- Title

- Description

- A preview of the first three charts in the dashboard, including the
  chart title and type

- When the dashboard was last modified

By default, the most recently modified dashboards are shown first in
the list. You can change the sort order by using the
:guilabel:`Sort By` dropdown menu.

.. _sample-dashboard:

Sample Dashboard
----------------

|charts| provides a :guilabel:`Sample Dashboard` that uses movie
data to show examples of possible charts you can create. You can access the
:guilabel:`Sample Dashboard` by going through the |charts-short|
:ref:`Welcome Experience <welcome-experience>`, or adding it through the
:ref:`Charts Settings <admin-settings>` page. 

.. note::

   If you remove the :guilabel:`Sample Dashboard`, you can add it back through your
   :ref:`Charts Settings <admin-settings>` page.

Sample Dashboard Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Sample Dashboard` comes with default filters for
:guilabel:`Genres` and :guilabel:`Year of Release`. You can adjust these
filters to modify the data that appears on your dashboard. To learn more
about filtering dashboard data, see :ref:`dashboard-filtering`. 

.. _refresh-dashboard-overview:

Refresh Dashboard Data
----------------------

|charts| automatically refreshes chart data once it becomes out of
date with the backing data source. You can also manually refresh
dashboard data at any time.

To learn how to configure auto refresh settings and underlying
refresh behavior, see :doc:`/dashboard-refresh`.

.. _get-chart-data-dashboard:

Get Chart Data
--------------

Authenticated dashboard users can view and export the
underlying chart data as a table. To view the chart data, click 
:guilabel:`Get Chart Data` from the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` menu. Each
row in the table represents a data point.

.. note::

   Users who open a dashboard using a public link can't get chart data.

.. _fullscreen-view:

Fullscreen View
---------------

|charts| provides a fullscreen view for dashboards. In this view,
|charts| hides the main navigation bar and expands the dashboard to
show the title, description, time of last modification, and charts in
the entire space of the screen.

To open a dashboard in fullscreen view, first select a dashboard from
the :guilabel:`Dashboards` page, then click the expanding arrows at the
top-right of the dashboard:

   :alt: Fullscreen Arrows

.. note::

   You can still :ref:`remove <dashboard-remove-chart>`, :ref:`resize
   <dashboard-resize-chart>`, :ref:`rearrange
   <dashboard-rearrange-chart>`, and :ref:`access editing
   <dashboard-edit-chart>` for charts in fullscreen view by hovering
   over the desired chart.

   Additionally, in fullscreen view you can still configure
   auto-refresh settings and manually refresh chart data.

To exit fullscreen view, either click the contracting arrows at the
top-right of the dashboard or press the escape key.
