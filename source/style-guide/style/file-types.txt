File Types

.. default-domain:: mongodb

For references to a file type in text (not code), use one of the
following naming conventions, depending on the type of file and the
context:

-  Generic name, such as an initialization file or a configuration file
-  Standard abbreviation, such as a PDF file or an XML file
-  File name extension, such as a .zip file

Use a generic name or a standard abbreviation if one exists. If a
generic name or a standard abbreviation doesn't exist or isn't
appropriate given the context, use the file name extension. The
following table provides some common file types and guidelines for
referring to them.

For guidelines for formatting file names and extensions, see
:ref:`text-formatting`.

       The frequently asked questions are located in the **faq.htm** file.
   * - initialization
     - Use the term *initialization* unless you're naming a specific file.
     - The initialization files contain default parameter values.

       Copy the **calibrate.ini** file.
   * - JSON
     - Use the term *JSON* unless you're naming a specific file.
     - You can directly edit the JSON environment file to add attributes
       specific to your configuration.

       The parameters provided with ``/type=install`` are visible in the
       **bootstrap.json** file.
   * - XML
     - Use the term *XML* unless you're naming a specific file.
     - The file is an XML document that defines configuration information
       regarding the web application.

       A service name maps to a collection of configuration entries in the
       Hadoop **core-site.xml** file.
   * - zip
     - Use the term *zip* for both general and specific references.
     - In the example, **file.zip** is the name that you assign to the zip
       file.
