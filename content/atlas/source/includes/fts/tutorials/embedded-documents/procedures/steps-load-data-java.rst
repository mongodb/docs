Create a Sample Collection and Load the Data 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must begin by creating a collection named ``schools`` in an 
existing or new database on your |service| {+cluster+}. After creating the 
collection, you must upload the sample data into your collection. To
learn more about the documents in the sample collection, see
:ref:`embedded-documents-tutorial-sample-collection`. 

The steps in this section walk you through creating a new database 
and collection, and loading the sample data into your collection.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Set up your Java project with the MongoDB Java driver.

      .. include:: /includes/fts/field-types/add-java-dependency.rst

      For more detailed installation instructions and version compatibility, see
      the :driver:`MongoDB Java Driver documentation </java/sync/current/get-started/>`.

   .. step:: Create and populate the collections.

      Create and populate the ``schools`` collection:
    
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/tutorials/embedded-documents/sample-data.java
         :language: java
         :copyable:
         :linenos:

      .. include:: /includes/search-shared/find-connection-string.rst

   .. step:: Compile and run the file to create the index.

      Compile and run your application in your IDE or your shell. 

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: shell

            javac FileName.java
            java FileName

         .. output::
            :visible: false
