           Skip this step if |service| indicates in the
           :guilabel:`Setup Connection Security` step that you have
           already configured a whitelist entry in your cluster. To
           manage the IP whitelist, see :ref:`Add Entries to the
           Whitelist <whitelist>`.

        |service| allows standard client connections to the cluster
        from entries in the :ref:`project's whitelist <whitelist>`. The
        project whitelist differs from the :ref:`API whitelist
        <whitelist-for-api-operations>`, which restricts *API* access
        to specific IP or |cidr| addresses.

        If the whitelist is empty, |service| prompts you to add an IP
        address to the project's whitelist. You can either:

        * Click :guilabel:`Add Your Current IP Address` to whitelist
          your current IP address.

        * Click :guilabel:`Add an IP Address` to add a single
          IP address or a CIDR-notated range of addresses.

        Provide an optional description for the newly added IP address
        or |cidr| range. Click :guilabel:`Add IP Address` to add the
        address to the whitelist.

        If the whitelist is empty, |service| prompts you to add an IP
        address to the project's whitelist. Click :guilabel:`Add a
        Different IP Address` to add a single IP address or a
        CIDR-notated range of addresses.

        Provide an optional description for the newly added IP address
        or |cidr| range. Click :guilabel:`Add IP Address` to add the
        address to the whitelist.

     **Skip this step** if |service| indicates in the
     :guilabel:`Setup connection security` step that you have at least
     one MongoDB user configured in your project. To manage existing
     MongoDB users, see :ref:`Add MongoDB Users <mongodb-users>`.

  To access the cluster, you need a MongoDB user with access to the
  desired database(s) on the cluster in your project. If your project
  has no MongoDB users, |service| prompts you to create a new user with
  the :ref:`Atlas Admin <atlas-user-privileges>` role.

  a. Enter the new user's :guilabel:`Username`
  b. Enter a :guilabel:`Password` for this new user or click
     :guilabel:`Autogenerate Secure Password`.
  c. Click :guilabel:`Create MongoDB User` to save the user.

  Use this user to connect to your cluster in the following step.

  Once you have whitelisted an IP address and added a MongoDB user,
  click :guilabel:`Choose Your Connection Method`.
