  Begin the cluster configuration process by choosing one of three
  cluster types: Starter, Single-Region, or Multi-Region. Each panel
  leads to a configuration page where you can customize your cluster
  to your specifications.

  Starter Clusters
    Starter clusters include the ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` tiers.
    These low-cost cluster types are suitable for teams who are
    learning MongoDB or developing small proof-of-concept applications.
    You can begin your project with a starter cluster and upgrade to a
    production-ready tier at a future time.

  Single-Region Clusters
    Single-Region clusters include ``M10`` and higher tiers. The
    ``M10`` and ``M20`` tiers are suitable for development environments
    and low-traffic applications, while higher tiers can handle large
    datasets and high-traffic applications. Single-Region clusters are
    deployed into a single geographical region, which reduces monthly
    costs but also reduces resilience in case of a regional network
    outage.

  Multi-Region Clusters
    Multi-Region clusters are deployed into multiple geographical
    regions, providing high availability and low latency for
    applications which are served worldwide. To deploy a :ref:`global
    cluster <global-clusters>`, toggle the :guilabel:`Global Clusters`
    switch to :guilabel:`On`.

  Select your preferred cluster preset and click :guilabel:`Create a
  Cluster` to customize the cluster configuration prior to deployment.
  If you prefer to configure your cluster with no preset options, click
  :guilabel:`Advanced Configuration Options` in the lower-right corner
  of the screen.

ref: config-cloud-provider-region
title: Select your preferred :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region`.
stepnum: 0
level: 4
content: |
  The choice of cloud provider and region affects the configuration
  options for the available cluster tiers, network latency for clients
  accessing your cluster, the geographic location of the nodes in your
  cluster, and the :doc:`cost of running the cluster </billing>`.

  For details, see :ref:`create-cluster-cloud-provider-region`.

  From the :guilabel:`Cloud Provider & Region` section, you can also
  choose to deploy your cluster across multiple regions. Multi-region
  clusters can better withstand data center outages and may contain
  dedicated geographic regions for localized reads, thereby improving
  performance. To learn how to deploy a multi-region cluster, see
  :ref:`create-cluster-multi-region`.

  The selected tier dictates the memory, storage, and |iops|
  specification for each data-bearing server [#data-bearing]_ in the
  cluster.
