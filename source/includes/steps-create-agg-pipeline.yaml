   In the aggregation pipeline pane in the lower-left corner,

   :manual:`aggregation pipeline stage
   </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>` to use for the first
   stage of the pipeline:

   Fill in your selected stage. If you enable :guilabel:`Auto Preview`,
   preview documents update automatically to the right of the stage to
   reflect the results of your pipeline as it progresses. You can adjust
   the width of the pipeline stage by dragging its border to the right.

title: Add additional pipeline stages.
level: 4
ref: add-additional-stages
content: |
   Click :guilabel:`Add Stage` to add additional aggregation stages
   below your last aggregation stage.
   Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each additional stage.

   .. note::

      The toggle to the right of the name of each pipeline stage
      dictates whether that stage is included in the pipeline. Toggling
      a pipeline stage also updates the pipeline preview, which reflects
      whether or not that stage is included.

      .. example::

         The following pipeline excludes the first
         :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage
         and only includes the
         :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project/>`
         stage:
