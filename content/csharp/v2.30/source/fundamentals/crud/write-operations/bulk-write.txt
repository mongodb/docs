Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform
**bulk write operations**. By using a bulk write operation, you can
perform multiple write operations in fewer calls to the database.

Consider a situation that requires you to insert documents, update
documents, and delete documents for the same task. If you use
the individual write methods to perform each type of operation, each write
accesses the database separately. You can use a bulk write operation to
optimize the number of calls your application makes to the server.

You can use the ``IMongoCollection.BulkWrite()`` or
``IMongoCollection.BulkWriteAsync()`` method to perform bulk write
operations on a single collection. Each method takes a list of
``WriteModel<TDocument>`` instances that describe the write operations
to perform.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:ref:`<csharp-quickstart>` tutorial.

Define the Write Operations
---------------------------

For each write operation you want to perform, create an instance of one of
the following ``WriteModel<TDocument>`` classes:

- ``DeleteManyModel<TDocument>``
- ``DeleteOneModel<TDocument>``
- ``InsertOneModel<TDocument>``
- ``ReplaceOneModel<TDocument>``
- ``UpdateManyModel<TDocument>``
- ``UpdateOneModel<TDocument>``

The following sections show how to create and use instances of the preceding classes
to perform the corresponding write operation in a bulk write operation.

.. tip:: Bulk Write Operations with POCOs

    The examples in this guide use the ``BsonDocument`` type for the ``TDocument`` type
    in all generic classes. You can also use a Plain Old CLR Object (POCO) for these
    classes. To do so, you must define a class that represents the documents in your
    collection. The class must have properties that match the fields in your documents.
    For more information, see :ref:`csharp-poco`.

Insert Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an insert operation, create an ``InsertOneModel<TDocument>``
instance and specify the document you want to insert.

The following example creates an instance of the
``InsertOneModel<BsonDocument>`` class. This instance directs the driver to
insert a document in which the ``"name"`` field is ``"Mongo's Deli"``
into the ``restaurants`` collection.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/CollectionBulkWrite.cs
   :start-after: start-insert-one
   :end-before: end-insert-one
   :language: csharp
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To insert multiple documents, create an instance of ``InsertOneModel<TDocument>``
for each document.

.. important:: Duplicate Key Error

   When performing a bulk operation, the ``InsertOneModel<TDocument>`` cannot
   insert a document with an ``_id`` that already exists in the
   collection. In this situation, the driver throws a
   ``MongoBulkWriteException``.

Update Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update a single document, create an instance of
``UpdateOneModel<TDocument>`` and pass the following arguments:

- **Query filter** that specifies the criteria used to match documents
  in your collection. To learn more about specifying a query, see
  :manual:`Query and Projection Operators
  </reference/operator/query/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

- **Update document** that describes the update to perform. To learn
  more about specifying an update, see :manual:`Update Operators
  </reference/operator/update/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

An ``UpdateOneModel<TDocument>`` instance specifies an update for *the first*
document that matches your query filter.

In the following code example, the ``UpdateOneModel<BsonDocument>`` object
represents an update operation on the ``restaurants`` collection.
The operation matches the first document in the collection where the value of the ``name``
field is ``"Mongo's Deli"``. It then updates the value of the ``cuisine`` field in the
matched document to ``"Sandwiches and Salads"``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/CollectionBulkWrite.cs
   :start-after: start-update-one
   :end-before: end-update-one
   :language: csharp
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To update multiple documents, create an instance of ``UpdateManyModel<TDocument>`` and pass
the same arguments as for ``UpdateOneModel<TDocument>``. The ``UpdateManyModel<TDocument>``
class specifies updates for *all* documents that match your query
filter.

In the following code example, the ``UpdateManyModel<BsonDocument>`` object
represents an update operation on the ``restaurants`` collection.
The operation matches all documents in the collection where
the value of the ``name`` field is ``"Mongo's Deli"``. It then updates
the value of the ``cuisine`` field to ``"Sandwiches and Salads"``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/CollectionBulkWrite.cs
   :start-after: start-update-many
   :end-before: end-update-many
   :language: csharp
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Replace Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A replace operation removes all fields and values of a specified document and
replaces them with new fields and values that you specify. To perform a
replace operation, create an instance of ``ReplaceOneModel<TDocument>`` and pass a
query filter and the fields and values you want to replace the matching
document with.

In the following example, the ``ReplaceOneModel<BsonDocument>`` object
represents a replace operation on the ``restaurants`` collection.
The operation matches the document in the collection
where the value of the ``restaurant_id`` field is ``"1234"``. It then
removes all fields other than ``_id`` from this document, and sets new values in the
``name``, ``cuisine``, ``borough``, and ``restaurant_id`` fields.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/CollectionBulkWrite.cs
   :start-after: start-replace-one
   :end-before: end-replace-one
   :language: csharp
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To replace multiple documents, you must create an instance of
``ReplaceOneModel<TDocument>`` for each document.

Delete Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a document, create an instance of ``DeleteOneModel<TDocument>`` and pass a
query filter specifying the document you want to delete. A
``DeleteOneModel<TDocument>`` instance provides instructions to delete
only *the first* document that matches your query filter.

In the following code example, the ``DeleteOneModel<BsonDocument>`` object
represents a delete operation on the ``restaurants`` collection.
The operation matches and deletes the first document
where the value of the ``restaurant_id`` field is ``"5678"``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/CollectionBulkWrite.cs
   :start-after: start-delete-one
   :end-before: end-delete-one
   :language: csharp
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To delete multiple documents, create an instance of ``DeleteManyModel<TDocument>`` and pass a
query filter specifying the documents you want to delete. An instance of
``DeleteManyModel<TDocument>`` provides instructions to remove *all* documents that
match your query filter.

In the following code example, the ``DeleteManyModel<BsonDocument>`` object
represents a delete operation on the ``restaurants`` collection.
The operation matches and deletes all documents
where the value of the ``name`` field is ``"Mongo's Deli"``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/CollectionBulkWrite.cs
   :start-after: start-delete-many
   :end-before: end-delete-many
   :language: csharp
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. _csharp-bulkwrite-method:

Perform the Bulk Operation
--------------------------

After you define a ``WriteModel`` instance for each operation that you want to perform,
create an instance of a class that implements the ``IEnumerable`` interface. Add your
``WriteModel`` objects to this ``IEnumerable``, then pass the ``IEnumerable``
to the ``BulkWrite()`` or ``BulkWriteAsync()`` method. By default, these methods run
the operations in the order they're defined in the list.

.. tip:: IEnumerable

   ``Array`` and ``List`` are two common classes that implement the
   ``IEnumerable`` interface.

Select from the following tabs to view how to use the synchronous ``BulkWrite()`` method
and the asynchronous ``BulkWriteAsync()`` method to perform a bulk write
operation on the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: bulk-write-sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/CollectionBulkWrite.cs
         :start-after: start-bulk-write-sync
         :end-before: end-bulk-write-sync
         :language: csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: bulk-write-async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/CollectionBulkWrite.cs
         :start-after: start-bulk-write-async
         :end-before: end-bulk-write-async
         :language: csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

The preceding code examples produce the following output:

.. code-block:: shell
   :copyable: false

   MongoDB.Driver.BulkWriteResult1+Acknowledged[MongoDB.Bson.BsonDocument]

.. note::

   When the driver runs a bulk operation, it uses the write concern of the
   target collection. The driver reports all write concern errors after
   attempting all operations, regardless of execution order.

Customize Bulk Write Operations
-------------------------------

When you call the ``BulkWrite()`` or ``BulkWriteAsync()`` method, you can pass an
instance of the ``BulkWriteOptions`` class. The ``BulkWriteOptions`` class
contains the following properties, which represent options you can use to configure the
bulk write operation:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``BypassDocumentValidation``
     - | Specifies whether the operation bypasses document-level validation. For more
         information, see :manual:`Schema
         Validation </core/schema-validation/#schema-validation>` in the {+mdb-server+}
         manual.
       | Defaults to ``False``.

   * - ``Comment``
     - | A comment to attach to the operation, in the form of a ``BsonValue``. For
         more information, see the :manual:`delete command
         fields </reference/command/delete/#command-fields>` guide in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``IsOrdered``
     - | If ``True``, the driver performs the write operations in the order
         provided. If an error occurs, the remaining operations are not
         attempted. 
       |
       | If ``False``, the driver performs the operations in an
         arbitrary order and attempts to perform all operations. If any of the write
         operations in an unordered bulk write fail, the driver
         reports the errors only after attempting all operations.
       | Defaults to ``True``.

   * - ``Let``
     - | A map of parameter names and values, in the form of a ``BsonDocument``. Values
         must be constant or closed
         expressions that don't reference document fields. For more information,
         see the :manual:`let statement
         </reference/command/delete/#std-label-delete-let-syntax>` in the
         {+mdb-server+} manual.

The following code examples use a ``BulkWriteOptions`` object to perform
an unordered bulk write operation:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Synchronous
      :tabid: bulk-write-options-sync

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/CollectionBulkWrite.cs
        :start-after: start-bulk-write-options-sync
        :end-before: end-bulk-write-options-sync
        :language: csharp
        :copyable:
        :dedent:

   .. tab:: Asynchronous
      :tabid: bulk-write-options-async

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/CollectionBulkWrite.cs
         :start-after: start-bulk-write-options-async
         :end-before: end-bulk-write-options-async
         :language: csharp
         :copyable:
         :dedent:

Return Value
------------

The ``BulkWrite()`` and ``BulkWriteAsync()`` methods return a
``BulkWriteResult`` object that contains the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``IsAcknowledged``
     - | Indicates whether the server acknowledged the bulk write operation. If the
         value of this property is ``False`` and you try to access any other property
         of the ``BulkWriteResult`` object, the driver throws an exception.
   
   * - ``DeletedCount``
     - | The number of documents deleted, if any.
   
   * - ``InsertedCount``
     - | The number of documents inserted, if any.

   * - ``MatchedCount``
     - | The number of documents matched for an update, if applicable.

   * - ``ModifiedCount``
     - | The number of documents modified, if any.

   * - ``IsModifiedCountAvailable``
     - | Indicates whether the modified count is available.

   * - ``Upserts``
     - | A list that contains information about each request that
         resulted in an upsert operation.
   
   * - ``RequestCount``
     - | The number of requests in the bulk operation.

Handling Exceptions
-------------------

If any of the operations in a bulk write operation fail, the {+driver-short+} throws a
``BulkWriteError`` and does not perform any further operations.

A ``BulkWriteError`` object contains the ``Index`` property that
describes the index of the request that resulted in an error.
