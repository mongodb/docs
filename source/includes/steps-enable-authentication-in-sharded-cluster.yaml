title: Enable authentication on each component in the cluster.
stepnum: 2
ref: enable-auth
pre: |
  On each :program:`mongos` and :program:`mongod` in the cluster,
  including all config servers and shards, specify the key file using
  one of the following approaches:
action:
  - heading: Specify the key file in the configuration file.
    pre: |
      In the configuration file, set the :setting:`~security.keyFile` option to the
      key file's path and then start the component, as in the following
      example:
    language: yaml
    code: |
      security:
        keyFile: /srv/mongodb/keyfile
  - heading: Specify the key file at runtime.
    pre:
      When starting the component, set the :option:`--keyFile <mongos --keyFile>`
      option, which is an option for both :program:`mongos` instances and
      :program:`mongod` instances. Set the :option:`--keyFile <mongos --keyFile>`
      to the key file's path. The :setting:`~security.keyFile` setting implies the
      :setting:`~security.authentication` setting, which means in most cases you do not need
      to set :setting:`~security.authentication` explicitly.

title: Add users.
stepnum: 3
ref: add-user
action:
  pre: |
    While connected to a :program:`mongos`, add the first
    administrative user and then add subsequent users. See
    :doc:`/tutorial/add-user-administrator`.
