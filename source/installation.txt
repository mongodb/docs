Installing and Upgrading
========================

In this guide, you can learn how to install and upgrade {+driver-short+}.

System Compatibility
--------------------

PyMongoArrow is regularly built and tested on macOS and Linux
(Ubuntu 20.04).

Python Compatibility
--------------------

PyMongoArrow is compatible with CPython 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.

Installation
------------

**PyMongoArrow** can be installed in three ways: via Pip, Conda, or Source.


**Using Pip.** We recommend using pip to install pymongoarrow on all platforms.
PyMongoArrow is available on
`PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/>`_.

  $ python -m pip install pymongoarrow

To get a specific version of pymongo::

  $ python -m pip install pymongoarrow==0.1.1

To upgrade using pip::

  $ python -m pip install --upgrade pymongoarrow

.. important:: 

   If the install fails due to an error like ``ValueError: Could
   not find "libbson-1.0" library`` it means that ``pip`` failed to find a
   suitable wheel for your platform.  We recommend first ensuring you have
   ``pip`` >= 20.3 installed. To upgrade ``pip`` run::

   .. code-block:: python

      $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip

   You can then attempt to re-install ``pymongoarrow``.

   We currently distribute wheels for macOS, Windows, and Linux on x86_64
   architectures.

**Using Conda.** PyMongoArrow is available for ``conda`` users by running::

.. code-block:: python

   $ conda install --channel conda-forge pymongoarrow

**From Source.** If the above options still do not allow you to install ``pymongoarrow`` on your
system, you will have to install from source, see :doc:`developer/installation`.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyMongoArrow requires:

- PyMongo>=4.4
- PyArrow>=13,<13.1

To use PyMongoArrow with a PyMongo feature that requires an optional
dependency, users must install PyMongo with the given dependency manually.

.. note:: 

   PyMongo's optional dependencies are detailed
   `here <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#dependencies>`_.

For example, to use PyMongoArrow with Client-Side Field Level Encryption
users must install PyMongo with the ``encryption`` extra in addition to installing
PyMongoArrow::

  $ python -m pip install 'pymongo[encryption]' pymongoarrow

Applications intending to use PyMongoArrow APIs that return query result sets
as :class:`pandas.DataFrame` instances (e.g. :meth:`~pymongoarrow.api.find_pandas_all`)
must also have ``pandas`` installed::

  $ python -m pip install pandas
