========================

.. meta::
   :description: Understand the costs associated with using Online Archive in Atlas, including data storage, processing, and transfer fees, and learn how to manage and monitor these expenses.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You incur {+adf+} costs for the following items: 

- Amount of data stored and accessed for {+Online-Archive+}. You are charged 
  on the basis of the gigabytes used and the number of days spent for data storage.
  The cost varies by the cloud provider and region. To learn more about 
  the pricing for each region, go to the `pricing page <https://www.mongodb.com/pricing?tck=docs_atlas>`__, 
  scroll down to the :guilabel:`Customize your deployment with tools & services` 
  section and click :guilabel:`See pricing` under {+Online-Archive+}.
- Amount of archived data processed while querying the {+Online-Archive+}, 
  and the amount of data transferred and returned when you
  query your {+Online-Archive+}. Note that |service| charges $5.00 per
  TB of processed data, with a 10 MB minimum processed data per query.
  You can optionally configure :ref:`query limits
  <adf-manage-query-limits>` to control data processing charges for your
  {+Online-Archive+}. 

To learn more about the consumption-based pricing for {+Online-Archive+}\s, 
see the `pricing page <https://www.mongodb.com/pricing>`__.

.. important:: 

   Before querying the archived data, we recommend using the 
   :manual:`explain </reference/method/cursor.explain/>` method to 
   optimize your queries. To calculate the monthly spend and approximate
   cost based on usage, consider the typical amount of data processed in 
   the :manual:`explain results </reference/explain-results/>` and
   multiply it by the typical number of queries per month.

   To stay abreast of your {+Online-Archive+} costs, we recommend the
   following: 

   - :ref:`Configure billing alerts <billing-alerts>` to avoid
     unexpected usage and charges. 
   - Monitor the :ref:`cost visualization <billing-visualizations>` and 
     :ref:`invoices <examine-invoices>` on your |service| billing page. 

     The {+fdi+} page for {+Online-Archive+} displays the amount of data
     that your {+fdi+} has processed and returned, and the number of queries run against it. However, it
     doesn't reflect the cost of your {+Online-Archive+}\s, which is 
     available in the |service| :ref:`billing page <atlas-billing>`
     only.
