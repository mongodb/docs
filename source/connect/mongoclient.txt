This guide shows you how to connect to a MongoDB instance or replica set
deployment by using the {+driver-short+}.

Overview
--------

Connecting to a MongoDB deployment requires the following components:

- **Connection URI**, also known as a *connection string*, which tells the {+driver-short+}
  which MongoDB deployment to connect to.
- **MongoClient** object, which creates and sustains the connection to the MongoDB deployment
  and lets you perform data operations.

You can also specify connection settings in either of these components to customize the way
the {+driver-short+} behaves while connected to MongoDB.

This guide shows you how to create a connection URI and use a ``MongoClient`` object
to connect to MongoDB.

Connection URI
--------------

A standard connection URI includes the following components:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Component
     - Description

   * - ``mongodb://``

     - Required. A prefix that identifies this as a string in the
       standard connection format.

   * - ``username:password``

     - Optional. Authentication credentials. If you include these, the client
       authenticates the user against the database specified in ``authSource``.
       For more information about authentication settings, see
       :ref:`csharp-authentication-mechanisms`. 

   * - ``host[:port]``

     - Required. The host and optional port number where MongoDB is running. If you don't
       include the port number, the driver uses the default port ``27017``.

   * - ``/defaultauthdb``
     
     - Optional. The authentication database to use if the
       connection string includes ``username:password@``
       authentication credentials but not the ``authSource`` option. If you don't include 
       this component, the client authenticates the user against the ``admin`` database.

   * - ``?<options>``

     - Optional. A query string that specifies connection-specific
       options as ``<name>=<value>`` pairs. See
       :ref:`csharp-connection-options` for a full description of
       these options.

For more information about creating a connection string, see
:manual:`Connection Strings </reference/connection-string?tck=docs_driver_csharp>` in the
MongoDB Server documentation.

MongoClient
-----------

To create a connection to MongoDB, pass a connection URI to the
``MongoClient`` constructor. In the following example, the driver uses a sample
connection URI to connect to a MongoDB deployment running on port ``27017`` of ``localhost``:

.. code-block:: csharp

   const string uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017/";
   var client = new MongoClient(uri);

Configure the Connection
------------------------

You can configure your connection in the following ways:

- Specifying parameters in the connection URI
- Specifying settings on a ``MongoClientSettings`` or ``MongoUrlBuilder`` object

To learn more about configuring your connection, see the
:ref:`csharp-connection-options` guide.

API Documentation
-----------------

To learn more about creating a ``MongoClient`` object with the {+driver-short+},
see the following API documentation:
