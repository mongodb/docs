The {+mcli+} configuration file stores related settings and
|api| keys in groups called *profiles*. You can define multiple profiles
so that you can use the {+mcli+} to access different MongoDB services or
projects from the same terminal. You can update the settings stored in
your configuration file by editing the file with a text editor or
by using the :ref:`mcli-config-set-command` command.

Configuration File Location
---------------------------

The first time you run the :ref:`mcli-config-command` command, the
{+mcli+} creates a configuration file called ``mongocli.toml``. The
{+mcli+} grants the user who ran the command read and write access to
the file. The {+mcli+} saves the configuration file to the folder where
your system stores application configuration files, which is defined by
the ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` environment variable. By default, this location
is the ``/.config`` folder of your home directory. If this folder
doesn't exist, the {+mcli+} creates the folder and grants you read,
write, and execute permissions.

Example
-------

The following example configuration file contains two profiles,
``default`` and ``myOpsManager``. 

The ``default`` profile connects to a |service| deployment and contains
the following settings:

- An organization ID
- |api| keys
- A project ID

The ``myOpsManager`` profile connects to an |onprem| deployment and
contains contains the following settings:

- The |onprem| base |url|
- An organization ID
- |api| keys
- A project ID

.. note:: 
   When you run a {+mcli+} command without the ``--profile`` flag, the
   {+mcli+} uses the profile named ``default`` by default. To use a
   profile with another name, you must specify it in the command with the ``--profile`` flag.
