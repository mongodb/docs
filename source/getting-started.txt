Getting Started
===============

|service| Group
---------------

To get started, create a new group by entering the project name and
select "Fully Managed".

Sentence about only |service| clusters in |service| group. Probably
something about unique group name across |service| and self-managed
cloudmgr (if that is indeed the case?).

? Perhaps if there are any ramifications if you are already an
existing cloud mgr user, maybe a sentence about that. But I'm guessing not?


Create a New Cluster
--------------------

Intro sentence about how |service| will walk you through creating a new
|service| cluster.

Maybe a blurb about MongoDB 3.2 + WT (single source so that if we
decide to remove it, we can easily just not include it.)

Explanation of stuff you select.

Probably blurb that state that you have the ability to change xyz after
you have created the cluster and a blurb about what you cannot change.

.. important:: stuff about password

Payment Stuff
-------------

Continue to payment.

Enter payment and Confirm deploy.

|service| will bring to Clusters page.

Next Steps (or Connect)
-----------------------

While deploying, you can set up ip whitelist. Can only connect from
whitelisted ips.

To connect, you need to setup ip whitelist. Link to connect to cluster
