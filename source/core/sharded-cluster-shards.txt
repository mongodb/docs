=============
Shard Servers
=============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. TODO Intro paragraph .. following is just a placeholder.

A shard is a :term:`replica set` or a single :program:`mongod` that
contains a subset of the data for the sharded cluster. Together, the
cluster's shards hold the entire data set for the cluster.

Typically each shard is a replica set. The replica set provides
redundancy and high availability for the data in each shard.

.. important:: MongoDB shards data on a *per collection* basis. You
   *must* access all data in a sharded cluster via the
   :program:`mongos` instances. If you connect directly to a shard, you
   will see only its fraction of the cluster's data. The data on any
   given shard may be somewhat random. MongoDB does not guarantee that
   any two contiguous chunks will reside on a single shard.

Primary Shard
-------------

Every database has a "primary" [#overloaded-primary-term]_ shard that
holds all the un-sharded collections in that database.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-primary-shard.rst

To change the primary shard for a database, use the
:dbcommand:`movePrimary` command.

.. warning::

   The :dbcommand:`movePrimary` command can be expensive because it
   copies all non-sharded data to the new shard. During this time,
   this data will be unavailable for other operations.

When you deploy a new :term:`sharded cluster`, the "first" shard
becomes the primary shard for all existing databases before enabling
sharding. Databases created subsequently may reside on any shard in the
cluster.

.. [#overloaded-primary-term] The term "primary" shard has nothing to
   do with the term :term:`primary` in the context of :term:`replica
   sets <replica set>`.

Shard Status
------------

Use the :method:`sh.status()` method in the :program:`mongo` shell to
see an overview of the cluster. The overview includes information such
as the primary shard for the database and the :term:`chunk`
distribution across the shards. See :method:`sh.status()` method for
more details.
