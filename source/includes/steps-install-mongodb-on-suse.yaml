  Add the repository so that you can install MongoDB. Use the command
  appropriate for your version of SUSE:
content: |
  .. tabs::

     .. tab:: SUSE 15
        :tabid: suse-15

        .. code-block:: bash

           sudo zypper addrepo --gpgcheck "https://repo.mongodb.org/zypper/suse/15/mongodb-org/{+version+}/x86_64/" mongodb

     .. tab:: SUSE 12
        :tabid: suse-12

        .. code-block:: bash

           sudo zypper addrepo --gpgcheck "https://repo.mongodb.org/zypper/suse/12/mongodb-org/{+version+}/x86_64/" mongodb

        To install MongoDB packages from a previous :ref:`release
        series <release-version-numbers>` such as 4.0, you can
        specify the release series in the repository configuration.

        For example, to restrict your SUSE 12 system to the 4.0 release
        series, use the following command:

        .. code-block:: bash

           sudo zypper addrepo --no-gpgcheck "https://repo.mongodb.org/zypper/suse/12/mongodb-org/4.0/x86_64/" mongodb

# pre: |
#   When you install the packages, you choose whether to install the current
#   release or a previous one. This step provides the commands for both.

      To install the latest version of MongoDB, issue the following
      command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo zypper -n install {+package-name-org+}
  - pre: |
      To install a specific release of MongoDB, specify each
      component package individually and append the version number to the
      package name, as in the following example:

      .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-suse.rst
  - pre: |
      You can specify any available version of MongoDB. However ``zypper``
      upgrades the packages when a newer version becomes available. To
      prevent unintended upgrades, pin the packages by running the following
      command:

      .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-suse-lock.rst
post: |
  Previous versions of MongoDB packages use a different repository location.
  Refer to the version of the documentation appropriate for
  your MongoDB version.
