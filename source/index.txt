--------------------------------------------------

|service-fullname| makes it easy to deploy and manage databases
on-demand when and where you need them.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Deploy a Database
      :tabid: deploy

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Choose a Deployment Type

            Play around with a free cluster, launch a serverless instance
            (available in preview), or define a dedicated cluster
            configuration for your application.

            To choose a deployment type, see :ref:`ref-deployment-types`.

         .. step:: Choose a Cloud Provider and Region

            Deploy your database to the same cloud provider and region as
            your applications to reduce latency and standardize security
            controls. 

            To choose a cloud provider and region, see :ref:`create-cluster-cloud-provider-region`.

         .. step:: Customize your Database Deployment

            Enable multi-cloud and multi-region data distribution to
            expand global coverage, increase fault tolerance, and meet
            data compliance requirements. 

            To customize your database deployment, see :ref:`create-cluster-multi-region`.

   .. tab:: Secure your Database
      :tabid: secure

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Add IP Access List Entries

            Define an IP access list for your database deployment.
            Always-on authentication ensures only approved client
            connections can access your database.

            To add IP Access List entries, see :ref:`access-list`.

         .. step:: Manage Database Users

            Define how your team members and applications authenticate
            to your database and what data they can access.

            To manage database users, see :ref:`mongodb-users`.

         .. step:: (Optional) Configure Private Network Access

            Configure peering connections or private endpoints for your
            applications to connect to your databases for additional 
            security controls. 

            To configure peering connections, see :ref:`vpc-peering`.
            To configure private endpoints, see :ref:`private-endpoint`.

   .. tab:: Connect to your Database
      :tabid: connect

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Choose a Connection Type

            Connect to your database using the MongoDB Shell, one of
            MongoDB's native language drivers, MongoDB Compass, or the
            MongoDB Connector for BI.

            To connect to your database, see :ref:`atlas-connect-to-deployment`.

         .. step:: Interact with your Data

            Use your chosen connection type to view your data, import
            documents, and run queries.

            To insert data, see :ref:`gswa-insert-data`.

   .. tab:: Optimize your Database
      :tabid: optimize

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Create Custom Alerts

            Customize default alerts or create new ones to receive
            notifications based on events and metrics that you define.

            To create custom alerts, see :ref:`alerts`.

         .. step:: Review Index and Schema Suggestions

            See on-demand index and schema suggestions for your
            collections to improve your application's query performance.

            To review suggestions, see :ref:`analyze-slow-queries` and
            :ref:`schema-suggestions`.

         .. step:: Automate Archival of Cold Data

            Define archival rules to move infrequently accessed data
            into fully managed cloud object storage while retaining full
            queryability of that data.

            To archive your data, see :ref:`manage-online-archive`.
