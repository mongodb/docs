|charts| automatically refreshes chart data once it becomes out of
date with the backing data source. You can also manually refresh
dashboard data at any time.

Configure Refresh Settings
--------------------------

Charts on a dashboard automatically refresh once their data becomes out
of date. You can specify how stale your charts' data can be before it is
refreshed. This is known as your staleness tolerance. The default
behavior is to refresh when data is one hour stale.

To configure refresh settings for a dashboard:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Select a dashboard from the 
      :guilabel:`Dashboards` page.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Refresh` icon 
      at the top of the dashboard.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Refresh Settings` 
      from the dropdown.
   
   .. step:: Select your data staleness tolerance 
      from the dropdown. 

      |charts-short| supports the following staleness tolerances:
      
      - An increment of time between 1 minute and 30 days, or
      - Infinity. If you select infinity, your chart doesn't automatically refresh.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Save`.

Manually Refresh Data
---------------------

You can manually refresh an entire dashboard or individual charts to
render your charts with the latest data. In a manual refresh, |charts|
reloads data even if the current data is within your specified staleness
tolerance.

|charts| users of all :ref:`permission levels <dashboard-permissions>`
can refresh dashboard data.

Manually Refresh an Entire Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manually refresh an entire dashboard to requery all of the data sources
backing your charts and render your charts with the latest data.

To manually refresh dashboard data:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Select a dashboard from the 
      :guilabel:`Dashboards` page.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Refresh` 
      icon.

   .. step:: Select :guilabel:`Force Refresh` 
      from the dropdown.

Manually Refresh a Single Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manually refresh a single chart to only requery the data source for that
chart and render that chart with the latest data.

To manually refresh a single chart:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Select a dashboard from the 
      :guilabel:`Dashboards` page.

   .. step:: Hover over the upper right corner of the desired chart and click the
      ellipsis button (:icon-mms:`ellipsis`).

   .. step:: Click 
      :guilabel:`Force Refresh`.

Refresh Behavior
----------------

When |charts-short| refreshes dashboard data, only charts with data 
older than your specified staleness tolerance are refreshed.
|charts-short| does not refresh the entire dashboard at once.

.. include:: /includes/fact-refresh-persistence.rst

The refresh details displayed on your charts depend on your chart viewing method
and the failure status of your last refresh:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 66
   :stub-columns: 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Viewing Method
     - Details You See

   * - Authenticated Dashboard
     - 
       - The error code that describes why the refresh failed, if
         applicable. 
       - Time since the last refresh occurred.
       - Time until the next automatic refresh occurs.

   * - Dashboard Accessed with a Public Link
     - 
       - Time since the last refresh occurred.
       - Time until the next automatic refresh occurs.

   * - Embedded using an iframe or the SDK
     - 
       - The :ref:`embedding error code <embedded-errors>` that
         describes why the refresh failed, if applicable.
       - If the chart is configured to automatically refresh: 
         - Time since the last refresh occurred.
         - Time until the next automatic refresh occurs.

You can hover over the timer at the bottom of each chart to view information about refresh times:

Caching Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When |charts| loads charts on a dashboard, it does not consistently
query the data source for each chart. Instead, |charts| queries the
data sources when the dashboard first loads, and that data is cached
on both the client and server.

.. note::

   The data stored in the cache is encrypted with a key specific to
   your |charts| tenant.

When you manually refresh an entire dashboard, |charts-short| updates
all chart data by querying the data source for the latest data even if
the chart data is within the specified staleness tolerance period.

When a dashboard refreshes automatically:

- If a chart's data is within the staleness tolerance period,
  |charts-short| doesn't refresh the chart's data.

- If a chart's data is outside of the staleness tolerance period, 
  |charts-short| returns the latest data from the server cache. If the
  server cache contains stale data, |charts-short| queries the data 
  source for the latest data, refreshes the chart, and updates the 
  data cached on both the client and server.

  .. note::

     If your chart is embedded using
     :ref:`Atlas App Services Authentication <stitch-sdk-tutorial>` 
     and
     :guilabel:`Fetch data using Atlas App Services` is enabled in your
     :ref:`Authentication Provider Settings
     <configure-auth-providers>`, your chart does not load data from
     the server cache. Your ``maxDataAge`` embedding parameter still
     dictates how often the chart refreshes, but the data source is
     always queried on each render.

Refresh Failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an automatic or manual refresh fails, |charts| displays the most recently rendered chart, including all of the chart's interactive elements, 
along with an error message that reads ``Last refresh failed``. If |charts| has never successfully rendered the chart, the error message instead reads ``Unable to load data``. 

If you're viewing a chart that is rendered on an Authenticated Dashboard or embedded using an iframe or the SDK, 
you can click the :guilabel:`Refresh` link in the error message to manually refresh the chart. 

If you're viewing the chart on an Authenticated Dashboard, 
click the :guilabel:`failed` link in the error message to view
additional error details.

.. note::

   The :guilabel:`failed` link is not available when you view charts on a dashboard 
   from a public link or embedded using an iframe or the SDK.
