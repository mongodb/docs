     * - Storage Capacity
       - The target host's hardware needs to have sufficient free storage
         space for storing the restored data. If you want to keep any
         existing cluster data on this host, make sure the host
         has sufficient free space for the cluster data and the
         restored data.

     * - MongoDB Version
       - The target host on which you are restoring and the source host
         from which you are restoring  must run the same MongoDB
         Server version. To check the MongoDB version, run ``mongod
         --version`` from a terminal or shell.

  Before you move the snapshot's data files to the target host, check
  whether the target host contains any existing files, and delete all 
  the files except the ``automation-mongod.conf`` file.
  
  Unpack the snapshot files and move them to the target host as follows:

  .. code-block:: sh

     tar -xvf <backupSnapshot>.tar.gz
     mv <backupSnapshot> </path/to/datafiles>
