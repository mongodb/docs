Overview
--------

MongoDB's server sessions, or logical sessions, are the underlying
framework used by :ref:`client sessions <3.6-client-sessions>` to
support :ref:`causal-consistency` and :ref:`retryable writes <retryable-writes>`.

.. important::

   Applications use :ref:`client sessions <3.6-client-sessions>` to
   interface with server sessions.

Server sessions are available for standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances, replica sets, and sharded clusters.

Sessions and Access Control
---------------------------

If the deployment enforces authentication/authorization, the user must
be authenticated to start a session, and only that user can use the
session.

If the deployment does not enforce authentication/authorization, a
created session has no owner and can be used by any user on any
connection. If the user authenticates and creates a session for a
deployment that does not enforce authentication/authorization, the user
owns the session. However, any user on any connection may use the
session.

If the deployment transitions to auth without any downtime, any
sessions without an owner cannot be used.
