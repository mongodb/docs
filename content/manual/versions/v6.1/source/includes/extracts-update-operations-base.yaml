ref: _update-operation-empty-operand-expressions
content: |
  Starting in MongoDB 5.0, :binary:`~bin.mongod` no longer raises an
  error when you use an update operator like :update:`${{operator}}`
  with an empty operand expression ( ``{ }`` ). An empty update results
  in no changes and no :term:`oplog` entry is created (meaning that the
  operation is a no-op).
