To complete this tutorial you will need a
`MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`_ cluster. Refer
to the :atlas:`Create a Cluster </create-new-cluster/>` documentation
for instructions on creating an |service| cluster.

Instructions

Create a :doc:`dashboard </dashboards>` to hold your visualizations:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-charts.rst

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-project-dashboards.rst

   .. step:: Create a dashboard.

      a. Click :guilabel:`Add Dashboard`.

      #. In the :guilabel:`Add Dashboard` dialog, copy the following 
         into the :guilabel:`Title` input:

         .. code-block:: none

            Movie Details

      #. Copy the following into the :guilabel:`Description` input:

         .. code-block:: none

            Insights from the Sample Mflix dataset.

After clicking create, |charts-short| navigates you to your newly
created dashboard and prompts you to add your first chart.
