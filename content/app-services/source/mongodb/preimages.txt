Overview
--------

Every `database trigger <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-ui/triggers/database-triggers/>`__ execution has a related
change event. You can configure these change events to include
**document preimages**. A preimage is a snapshot of a document *before*
a change.

.. example::
   
   Consider ``updateOne`` in a collection with preimages:
   
   .. code-block:: js
      
      pets.updateOne(
         { name: "Fido" },
         { $inc: { age: 1 } }
      )

   Preimages add the following data to write operation change events
   
   - the document preimage in the ``fullDocumentBeforeChange`` field
     
     .. code-block:: json
        :caption: Preimage - the full document as it existed before the change
        :emphasize-lines: 3
     
        {
           "name": "Fido",
           "age": 3
        }
   
   - the document postimage in the ``fullDocument`` field
     
     .. code-block:: json
        :caption: Postimage - the full document immediately after the change
        :emphasize-lines: 3
     
        {
           "name": "Fido",
           "age": 4
        }

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

For clusters running MongoDB version 6.0 and newer, triggers use the
cluster's built-in :ref:`change stream preimages <changeStreams>`
feature. Older versions of MongoDB store preimages directly in the
oplog. Both of these add storage and compute overhead for each operation
on the collection which may cause performance issues for collections
with a high write throughput.

Enable Document Preimages
-------------------------

You can enable preimages when you :ref:`configure a database trigger 
<create-a-database-trigger>`. :guilabel:`Document Preimage` is a setting 
on trigger configuration. Toggle this to enable document preimages for the 
collection. 

.. _view-preimage-enabled-collections:

View Preimage-Enabled Collections
---------------------------------

To view the list of collections that store document preimages: 

1. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Linked Data Source` configuration screen.
2. Expand the :guilabel:`Advanced Configuration` section.

This section contains the :guilabel:`Preimage Preferences by Collection` 
table.

This table lists every collection that stores preimages in the oplog. 
Enabling preimages for a collection applies to all collections. This 
includes collections tied to triggers in a different App. Collections 
with no triggers that use preimages also appear here.

.. _disable-collection-preimages:

Disable Preimages for a Collection
----------------------------------

You can disable collection-level preimages in the App Services UI.

To disable preimages for a collection:

1. (Optional) Disable document preimages for triggers in the collection.
   Triggers with preimages continue to fire after disabling preimages. 
   But they don't have the ``fullDocumentBeforeChange`` field in change 
   events. This includes triggers in other App Services Apps.

2. :ref:`Terminate sync <terminating-realm-sync>`, if the collection is part 
   of a synced cluster.

3. View :ref:`the Preimage Preferences By Collection 
   <view-preimage-enabled-collections>` table. Press the
   :guilabel:`Disable` button for a collection. This turns off preimages for 
   that collection.

4. :ref:`Re-enable Sync <re-enable-realm-sync>`, if the collection is part 
   of a synced cluster.
