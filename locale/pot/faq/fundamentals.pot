# 65a8cb02be074346a35a4a4080758b8b
msgid "MongoDB is a :term:`document`\\-oriented DBMS. Think of MySQL but with :term:`JSON`-like objects comprising the data model, rather than RDBMS tables. Significantly, MongoDB supports neither joins nor transactions. However, it features secondary indexes, an expressive query language, atomic writes on a per-document level, and fully-consistent reads."

# fee7510d438e48b48ee4454e8922787c
msgid "Instead of tables, a MongoDB database stores its data in :term:`collections <collection>`, which are the rough equivalent of RDBMS tables. A collection holds one or more :term:`documents <document>`, which corresponds to a record or a row in a relational database table, and each document has one or more fields, which corresponds to a column in a relational database table."

# 886d605dc4de495e894f76fd4d302ac9
msgid "MongoDB uses dynamic schemas. You can create collections without defining the structure, i.e. the fields or the types of their values, of the documents in the collection. You can change the structure of documents simply by adding new fields or deleting existing ones. Documents in a collection need not have an identical set of fields."

msgid "In practice, it is common for the documents in a collection to have a largely homogeneous structure; however, this is not a requirement. MongoDB's flexible schemas mean that schema migration and augmentation are very easy in practice, and you will rarely, if ever, need to write scripts that perform \"alter table\" type operations, which simplifies and facilitates iterative software development with MongoDB."

# a2480a1c95ba451c8386d2c7a6a194e9
msgid "No. In MongoDB, a document's representation in the database is similar to its representation in application memory. This means the database already stores the usable form of data, making the data usable in both the persistent store and in the application cache. This eliminates the need for a separate caching layer in the application."

# e53c344f10644ce296f4cb15d7230c2d
msgid "This differs from relational databases, where caching data is more expensive. Relational databases must transform data into object representations that applications can read and must store the transformed data in a separate cache: if these transformation from data to application objects require joins, this process increases the overhead related to using the database which increases the importance of the caching layer."
