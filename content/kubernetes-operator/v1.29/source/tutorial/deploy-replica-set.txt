A :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` is a group of MongoDB deployments that maintain
the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high
availability and are the basis for all production deployments.

To learn more about replica sets, see the
:manual:`Replication Introduction </core/replication-introduction>` in
the MongoDB manual.

Use this procedure to deploy a new replica set that |mms| manages.
After deployment, use |mms| to manage the replica set, including such
operations as adding, removing, and reconfiguring members.

Considerations
--------------

When you deploy your replica set via the |k8s-op-short|, you must
choose whether to encrypt connections using |tls| certificates.

The following procedure for :guilabel:`TLS-Encrypted` connections:

- Establishes |tls|-encrypted connections between MongoDB hosts in the
  replica set.
- Establishes |tls|-encrypted connections between client applications
  and MongoDB deployments.
- Requires valid certificates for |tls| encryption.

The following procedure for :guilabel:`Non-Encrypted Connections`:

- Doesn't encrypt connections between MongoDB hosts in the
  replica set.
- Doesn't encrypt connections between client applications
  and MongoDB deployments.
- Has fewer setup requirements than a deployment with |tls|-encrypted
  connections.

To set up |tls| encryption for a sharded cluster, see 
:ref:`deploy-sharded-cluster`.

Select the appropriate tab based on whether you want to encrypt your
replica set connections with |tls|.

      Renew TLS Certificates for a Replica Set
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Renew your |tls| certificates periodically
      using the following procedure:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-k8s-rs-tls-custom-renew.rst

   .. tab:: Non-Encrypted Connections
      :tabid: non-encrypted
