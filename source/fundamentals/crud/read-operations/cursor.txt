Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to access
data returned from a read operation or aggregation by using a **cursor**. A
cursor is a mechanism that enables you to iterate through multiple documents
while holding only a subset of them in memory at a given time. 

The driver offers the ``Cursor`` type to retrieve documents from a cursor.
For example, when you run a find operation that can return multiple
documents, the driver returns a ``Cursor`` instance from which you can access
the matched documents.

After you run a read operation or aggregation, the returned ``Cursor`` instance
contains the first batch of results from the operation. As you iterate through
the cursor, the server returns more individual results. If there are more
matching documents after you reach the end of a batch of results, the ``Cursor``
instance fetches the next batch of documents until all the results are returned.

This guide includes the following sections:

- :ref:`Retrieve Documents Individually <rust-cursor-individual>`:
  describes how to use iteration or a stream to access results one at a time

- :ref:`Retrieve Documents as an Array <rust-cursor-array>`:
  describes how to access all results as a single array by collecting the
  returned cursor results

- :ref:`Specify Cursor Behavior <rust-cursor-options>`: describes how
  to configure the cursor that a method returns

- :ref:`Additional Information <rust-cursor-addtl-info>`:
  provides links to related topics and API documentation for types
  and methods mentioned in this guide

.. _rust-cursor-individual:

Retrieve Documents Individually
-------------------------------

The driver provides the following access patterns to iterate through
documents returned by a ``Cursor`` instance:

- :ref:`Built-in Pattern <rust-cursor-indiv-builtin>`: advance the cursor,
  then retrieve and deserialize the current document
- :ref:`Stream Implementation Pattern <rust-cursor-indiv-stream>`: iterate over
  the cursor and call methods provided by ``Stream`` to process single
  or multiple documents

The following sections describe these access patterns and corresponding
methods in more detail.

.. _rust-cursor-indiv-builtin:

Built-in Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the driver's built-in access pattern to retrieve and process
documents one by one.

The ``Cursor`` type includes the ``advance()`` and
``deserialize_current()`` methods to iterate through a cursor and
access documents individually.

The ``advance()`` method moves the cursor forward and sends a request to the
database for more results when the local buffer is exhausted, which occurs
when the cursor reaches the end of a batch of results. Each time the cursor
reaches the end of a batch of results, it requests the next batch. The cursor
is exhausted when it has no more matching documents to return and is no longer
usable. The ``advance()`` method returns a ``true`` result if new results are
successfully returned and a ``false`` result if the cursor is closed.

The ``deserialize_current()`` method returns a reference to the current
result in the cursor and deserializes the result into the type
associated with the cursor. Unless you specify a type, the method uses the
same type that your collection is parameterized with.

.. important::
   
   You can only call the ``deserialize_current()`` method if the ``advance()``
   method returns a ``true`` result. The driver generates an error if you call
   ``deserialize_current()`` on the cursor without a ``true`` result or
   without calling previously calling ``advance()``.

The following example shows how to implement this access pattern to
iterate through the results of a find operation on the ``fruits``
collection:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/cursor.rs
      :start-after: start-indiv-builtin
      :end-before: end-indiv-builtin
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Document({"_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": String("strawberry"), "color": String("red")})
      Document({"_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": String("pomegranate"), "color": String("red")})

.. _rust-cursor-indiv-stream:

Stream Implementation Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access cursor results as a stream to retrieve individual documents
or collect multiple documents at once.

The ``Cursor`` type implements the ``Stream`` trait, so you can iterate
through the cursor as a stream. This pattern may help you write more
concise code than the built-in pattern, since the ``Stream`` extension trait
``StreamExt`` provides numerous functions to combine operations and
consolidate code.

You can use the following methods to use the stream pattern:

- ``next()``: advances the cursor to the next result and returns an
  ``Option<Result<T>>`` type
- ``try_next()``: advances the cursor to the next result and returns
  a ``Result<Option<T>>`` type

.. important:: Required Imports for Stream Pattern Methods

   To use the ``next()`` method, you must import the ``StreamExt``
   trait. To use the ``try_next()`` method, you must import the
   ``TryStreamExt`` trait.

The following example shows how to implement the two stream methods to
iterate through the results of find operations on the ``fruits``
collection:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/cursor.rs
      :start-after: start-indiv-stream
      :end-before: end-indiv-stream
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Output from next() iteration:
      { "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "strawberry", "color": "red" }
      { "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "pomegranate", "color": "red" }
      
      Output from try_next() iteration:
      { "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "banana", "color": "yellow" }
      { "_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "pineapple", "color": "yellow" }

.. _rust-cursor-array:

Retrieve Documents as an Array
------------------------------

Because the ``Cursor`` type implements the ``Stream`` trait, you can
collect the results from a cursor into an array.

You can use the following methods to retrieve documents as an array:

- ``collect()``: collects results from a cursor into a
  ``Vec<Result<T>>`` type
- ``try_collect()``: collects results from a cursor into a
  ``Result<Vec<T>>`` type

.. note::

   To use the ``collect()`` method, you must import the ``StreamExt``
   trait. To use the ``try_collect()`` method, you must import the
   ``TryStreamExt`` trait.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/cursor.rs
      :start-after: start-array
      :end-before: end-array
      :language: rust
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: console
      :visible: false

      Output from collect():
      [Ok(Document({"_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": String("strawberry"), "color": String("red")})), Ok(Document({"_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": String("pomegranate"), "color": String("red")}))]
      
      Output from try_collect():
      [Document({"_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": String("banana"), "color": String("yellow")}), Document({"_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": String("pineapple"), "color": String("yellow")})]

.. warning:: Avoid Exceeding Application Memory Limits

   Avoid converting large sets of results to arrays. If the array exceeds
   the size of available application memory, your application might crash.
   If you expect a large result set, retrieve documents from the cursor individually.
   To learn how to iterate through the cursor, see the :ref:`Retrieve Documents Individually 
   <rust-cursor-individual>` section of this guide.

.. _rust-cursor-options:

Specify Cursor Behavior
-----------------------

To modify the cursor that an operation returns, pass options to
the method that returns the ``Cursor`` instance. For example, you can
specify cursor-related options in a ``FindOptions`` type that you pass to the
``find()`` method.

The following table describes cursor-related options that you can set in
an options instance:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description

   * - ``batch_size`` 
     - | Specifies the maximum number of documents the server returns per
         cursor batch. This option sets the number of documents the cursor
         keeps in memory rather than the number of documents the cursor
         returns.

       | Type: ``u32``
       | Default: ``101`` documents initially, ``16 MB`` maximum for
         subsequent batches

   * - ``cursor_type`` 
     - | Specifies the type of cursor to return. You can set this option
         to produce a tailable cursor. To learn more about tailable
         cursors, see :manual:`Tailable Cursors
         </core/tailable-cursors/>` in the Server manual.

       | Type: ``CursorType``
       | Default: ``CursorType::NonTailable``

   * - ``no_cursor_timeout`` 
     - | Specifies whether the server closes the cursor after a period
         of inactivity.

       .. important::
          
          Because the ``Cursor`` type implements the ``Drop`` trait, the
          server closes a cursor when it goes out of scope. The server
          runs an asynchronous ``killCursors`` command to close the
          cursor. See :manual:`killCursors </reference/command/killCursors/>`
          in the Server manual to learn more.

       | Type: ``bool``
       | Default: ``false``

The following code shows how to construct a ``FindOptions``
instance and specify cursor-related settings:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/crud/cursor.rs
   :start-after: start-options
   :end-before: end-options
   :language: rust
   :copyable:
   :dedent:
