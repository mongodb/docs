Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB and should
be considered for fields which your application reads often. To learn
more about creating effective indexes, see :manual:`Indexing Strategies

.. _de-create-an-index:

Create an Index
---------------

.. tip::

   When you create indexes, keep the ratio of reads to writes on the
   target collection in mind. Indexes come with a performance cost, but
   are more than worth the cost for frequent queries on large data sets.
   Before you create an index, review the documented
   :manual:`indexing strategies </applications/indexes/>`.

.. note::

   You can build full-text search with :ref:`Atlas Search 
   <fts-top-ref>`. |fts| offers fine-grained text indexing. To learn 
   more, see :ref:`ref-index-definitions`.
