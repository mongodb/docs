Dashboards are a collection of charts assembled to create a single
unified display of your data. Each chart shows data from a
single MongoDB collection or view, so dashboards are essential to
attain insight into multiple focal points of your data in a single
display.

Dashboards Tab
--------------

The :guilabel:`Dashboards` tab shows all dashboards you have access to
view. For more information on user permissions in MongoDB Charts,
see :doc:`Permission Model <permission-model>`.

Each dashboard shows the following information:

- Title

- Description

- A preview of the first three charts in the dashboard, including the
  chart title and type

- When the dashboard was last modified

By default, the most recently modified dashboards are shown first in
the list. You can change the sort order by using the
:guilabel:`Sort By` dropdown menu.
