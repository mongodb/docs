==================================
Configure MongoDB Database Backups
==================================

You can configure continuous, automated backups for the MongoDB
databases that the |k8s-op-short| manages using the MongoDB custom
resource.

.. note::

   If you already configured backups for your MongoDB resources during
   :ref:`MongoDB database resource deployment
   <k8s-deploy-mdb-resources>`, you don't need to complete the
   following procedure.

Considerations
--------------

Before you configure backups for MongoDB resources, see the following
considerations:

- If you set assignment labels using the |k8s-op-short|, the values that
  you set in the |k8s| configuration file for assignment labels override
  the values defined in the |mms| UI. Assignment labels that you don't set
  using the |k8s-op-short| continue to use the values set in the |mms| UI.

- If you set a snapshot schedule field using the |k8s-op-short|, the value
  that you set in the |k8s| configuration file for that field overrides
  the value defined in the |mms| UI. Snapshot schedule fields that you
  don't set using the |k8s-op-short| continue to use the value set in the
  |mms| UI.

  .. example::

     - You set ``backup.snapshotSchedule.snapshotIntervalHours=6`` in
       the |k8s-op-short|.
     - You set the following values in the UI:

       - Snapshot Inverval: 10
       - Snapshot Retention Days: 5

     |mms| uses the following values for your deployment:

     - Snapshot Inverval: 6
     - Snapshot Retention Days: 5

- If you enable backups for your MongoDB database deployment using the 
  |k8s-op-short|, but you don't set a snapshot schedule using the 
  |k8s-op-short|, |mms| uses the snapshot schedule you set in the |mms| UI.
- If you enable backups for your MongoDB deployment, but you don't set
  a snapshot schedule at all, |mms| uses the default snapshot schedule.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you configure continuous backups for MongoDB resources, complete
the following tasks:

- :doc:`Install the Kubernetes Operator </tutorial/install-k8s-operator>`.
- :ref:`Deploy the Ops Manager application <deploy-om-container>`.
- :doc:`Configure backups for the Ops Manager resource
  </tutorial/deploy-om-container>`. In the linked procedure, see the
  steps for configuring backups. Continuous backups for MongoDB
  databases require that you set the :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.enabled`
  value in the |onprem| :ref:`resource specification
  <k8s-om-specification>` to ``true``.
- Deploy a :ref:`replica set <deploy-replica-set>` or a 
  :ref:`sharded cluster <deploy-sharded-cluster>`.
