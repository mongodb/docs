``synonyms`` allow you to index and search your collection for 
words that have the same or nearly the same meaning. To configure an 
|fts| :ref:`index <ref-index-definitions>` with synonym mappings, you 
must:

1. Create a new collection with properly formatted synonym documents 
   in it. Ensure that: 
   
   - Your collection is in the same database as the index that will 
     reference the collection.
   - You format the documents in the collection as described in the 
     :ref:`<synonyms-coll-spec>`.

#. Reference the synonym source collection in a synonym mapping in 
   the :ref:`index definition <ref-index-definitions>`. 

This page describes the format of the synonyms source collection and 
how to define synonym mappings that reference the synonym source 
collection in your |fts| index. A synonym mapping configures an |fts| 
index to support queries that apply synonyms from a separate synonym 
source collection. You can use the :guilabel:`JSON Editor` view in the 
|service| :ref:`User Interface <ref-create-index>` or the |fts| 
:doc:`API </reference/api/fts-indexes-create-one>` to create the index. 
Synonyms can be used only in queries that use the :ref:`text-ref` 
operator.

.. _synonyms-syntax:

Syntax 
------

``synonyms`` has the following syntax in an index definition: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fts-index-definition-syntax.json
   :language: json
   :linenos:
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 10-18 

.. _synonyms-options:

Options 
-------

``synonyms`` takes the following fields in an index definition:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 15 60 10

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Necessity

   * - ``analyzer``
     - string
     - Name of the :ref:`analyzer <analyzers-ref>` to use with this 
       synonym mapping. You can use any |fts| analyzer except the 
       ``lucene.kuromoji`` :ref:`language analyzer 
       <ref-language-analyzers>` and the following :ref:`custom 
       analyzer <custom-analyzers>` tokenizers and token filters: 

       - :ref:`nGram <ngram-tokenizer-ref>` Tokenizer
       - :ref:`edgeGram <edgegram-tokenizer-ref>` Tokenizer
       - :ref:`daitchMokotoffSoundex <daitchmokotoffsoundex-tf-ref>` 
         Token Filter
       - :ref:`nGram <ngram-tf-ref>` Token Filter 
       - :ref:`edgeGram <edgegram-tf-ref>` Token Filter 
       - :ref:`shingle <shingle-tf-ref>` Token Filter

       .. note:: 

          To use synonyms with stop words, you must either index the 
          field using the :ref:`ref-standard-analyzer` or add the 
          synonym entry without the stop word.

     - Required

   * - ``name``
     - string 
     - Name of the synonym mapping. Name must be unique in the index 
       definition. Value can't be an empty string. 
     - Required

   * - ``source``
     - document
     - :ref:`Source collection <synonyms-coll-spec>` for synonyms. The 
       ``source`` option takes the ``collection`` field. 
     - Required

   * - ``source.collection``
     - string 
     - Name of the MongoDB collection that is in the same database as 
       the |fts| index. Documents in this collection must be in the 
       format described in the :ref:`synonyms-coll-spec`.
     - Required

.. _synonyms-coll-spec:

Synonyms Source Collection Documents 
------------------------------------

Each document in the collection specified as the source for the 
synonyms describe how one or more words map to one or more synonyms of 
those words. 

.. _synonyms-coll-format:

Format of Synonyms Source Collection Documents 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must configure each document with the following fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 10 60 15

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Necessity

   * - ``input``
     - array of strings
     - Required for ``mappingType: explicit`` mappings. 
     
       For ``explicit`` mappings, ``synonyms`` values are synonyms of 
       each ``input`` token. Value can't be an empty or all-whitespace 
       string. You can specify the same ``input`` value in multiple 
       documents.
       
     - Conditional

   * - ``mappingType`` 
     - string
     - Type of mapping. Value can be one of the following: 

       - ``equivalent`` - describes a set of tokens that are equivalent 
         to one another. For an example of this ``mappingType``, see 
         :ref:`Example <synonyms-equivalent-mapping-type-eg>`.

       - ``explicit`` - matches ``input`` tokens and replaces them with 
         all alternative ``synonyms`` tokens. For an example of this 
         ``mappingType``, see :ref:`Example 
         <synonyms-explicit-mapping-type-eg>`.
         
     - Required

   * - ``synonyms``
     - array of strings
     - Words that are synonyms of one another if ``mappingType`` is 
       ``equivalent`` or synonyms of ``input`` tokens if 
       ``mappingType`` is ``explicit``. ``synonyms`` must have at least 
       one value.

       .. note::

          |fts| considers each string, regardless of the number of 
          words within, to be a single token. For example, |fts| 
          tokenizes the string ``sushi chef`` as a single term and 
          doesn't return any results for a search for ``sushi`` or 
          ``chef`` individually.

          To use synonyms with stop words, you must either add the 
          synonym entry without the stop word or index the field using 
          the :ref:`ref-standard-analyzer`.

       For an example of each ``mappingType`` see 
       :ref:`synonyms-mapping-type-egs`.
     - Required

The documents in the collection can contain other fields. The 
documents in the collection are additive, and mappings are 
deduplicated. |fts| synonyms are stored as a separate |service| 
collection, which counts against the same storage quota as any other 
collection in |service|. |fts| might use more compute resources to 
apply synonyms from larger synonyms source collections.

.. warning:: 

   Don't include invalid synonym documents in the synonym source 
   collection. |fts| doesn't create indexes if the indexes use synonym 
   mappings that reference collections with invalid documents. Only 
   include synonym documents that are properly formatted in your 
   synonym source collection.

   MongoDB doesn't recommend adding synonym documents to synonym source 
   collections in a production environment without first validating 
   that they are properly formatted and behave as expected in a test 
   environment.

.. _synonyms-coll-changes:

Changes to Synonyms Source Collection Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you make changes to your synonyms source collection:

- You don't need to reindex because |fts| watches for changes and 
  automatically updates its internal synonym map.
- The time it takes |fts| to update the synonym mappings increases with 
  the synonym source collection size. Note that the changes to synonym 
  documents are reflected in your |fts| query results eventually.

.. _synonyms-mapping-type-egs:

``mappingType`` Examples 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _synonyms-equivalent-mapping-type-eg:

``equivalent`` 
``````````````

.. example:: 

   In this ``equivalent`` mapping type example, the ``synonyms`` tokens 
   ``car``, ``vehicle``, and ``automobile`` are configured to be 
   synonyms of one another:

   .. code-block:: json 
      :copyable: false

      {
        "mappingType": "equivalent",
        "synonyms": ["car", "vehicle", "automobile"]
      }

   For a :ref:`text-ref` query for ``car``, ``vehicle``, or 
   ``automobile`` applying a synonym mapping that includes such a 
   document, |fts| returns documents that contain the term ``car``, 
   ``vehicle``, or ``automobile``.

.. _synonyms-explicit-mapping-type-eg:

``explicit`` 
````````````

.. example:: 

   In this ``explicit`` mapping type example, ``input`` token ``beer`` 
   is configured to consider ``beer``, ``brew``, and ``pint`` as 
   synonyms:

   .. code-block:: json 
      :copyable: false

      {
        "mappingType": "explicit",
        "input": ["beer"],
        "synonyms": ["beer", "brew", "pint"]
      }

   For a :ref:`text-ref` query for ``beer`` applying a synonym mapping 
   that includes such a document, |fts| returns documents that contain 
   the terms "beer", "brew", or "pint" because the ``input`` token 
   ``beer`` is explicitly mapped to all these ``synonyms`` tokens. 
   However, for a query for ``pint``, |fts| does not find documents 
   that contain ``beer`` because ``pint`` is not explicitly mapped to 
   ``beer``.

.. _synonyms-egs:

Example 
-------

The examples on this page include:

- A :ref:`sample collection <synonyms-user-feedback-comments-coll>`
  titled ``user_feedback.comments``.

.. _synonyms-index-definition-ex:

Index Definition Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following examples for the ``user_feedback.comments`` collection show the 
index definitions using :ref:`static and dynamic mappings <static-dynamic-mappings>`.

.. note:: 

   For sample queries on the ``user_feedback.comments`` collection 
   using the following indexes, see :ref:`examples <text-ref-synonyms-eg>` 
   in the :ref:`text-ref` operator.

Static Mapping 
``````````````

The following index:

- Configures an index with a single text field and a single 
  synonym mapping definition that uses the mapping configured in 
  the ``user_feedback.synonyms`` collection.
- Analyzes the ``comments`` field with the ``lucene.english`` 
  analyzer.
- Enables synonyms from ``synonyms`` collection for queries 
  over fields analyzed with the ``lucene.english`` analyzer.

.. code-block:: json 

    {
      "mappings": {
        "dynamic": false,
        "fields": {
          "comments": {
            "type": "string",
            "analyzer": "lucene.english"
          }
        }
      },
      "synonyms": [
        {
          "analyzer": "lucene.english",
          "name": "mySynonyms",
          "source": {
            "collection": "synonyms"
          }
        }
      ]
    }

Dynamic Mapping 
```````````````

The following index: 

- Configures an index for all the fields in the documents and a 
  single synonym mapping definition that uses the mapping 
  configured in the ``user_feedback.synonyms`` collection.
- Uses the default analyzer, ``lucene.standard``, to analyze all 
  the fields.
- Enables synonyms from ``synonyms`` collection for queries over 
  fields analyzed with the ``lucene.standard`` analyzer.

.. code-block:: json 

    {
      "mappings": {
        "dynamic": true
      },
      "synonyms": [
        {
          "analyzer": "lucene.standard",
          "name": "mySynonyms",
          "source": {
            "collection": "synonyms"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
