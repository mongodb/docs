If you are using MongoDB in the Cloud (Atlas), you will need to:

  - :doc:`Create an Atlas Account and Cluster</guides/cloud/atlas>`
  - :doc:`Set Up Connectivity to Atlas </guides/cloud/connectionstring>` 

Or, if you plan on using a local instance of MongoDB, you will need to:
  
  - :doc:`Install MongoDB </guides/server/install>` and start up an instance to which you will connect.
