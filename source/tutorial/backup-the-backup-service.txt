Deploying the |onprem| Backup Blockstore and Application databases as
:term:`replica sets <replica set>` is key to protect the databases from
failure.

Ensure you configure and deploy your replica sets for failover and
redundancy.

Beyond using MongoDB's replication capabilities, you can create
backups for the Backup Blockstore database and Application database,
both for longterm storage of snapshots, and for backing
up |onprem| for disaster recovery purposes.

To restore |onprem|, you only need backups of the Application database
and the Backup Blockstore database. |onprem|'s other components are
stateless: you can rebuild them from the installation package if need
be.

.. important::

   Your Backup installation cannot back up |onprem|. If you wish to
   use |onprem| to back up |onprem|, you will need *two* |onprem|
   installations: one to back up your MongoDB deployment,
   and another to back up your |onprem| databases.

Back Up with the Public API
---------------------------

The |mms| Public API allows you to programmatically restore snapshots
on your desired schedule, and store them offline. Ideally, you should
save the backups to a tape drive, appending the new snapshots daily
until the drive is full, and then store the drive offsite.

Programmatically restoring snapshots has the same impact on a
snapshot as a typical restore.

See :doc:`the API documentation </reference/api/restore-jobs>` for how
to restore jobs using this method.

This method backs up the snapshots only: you **cannot** use the backups
to restore |onprem| in the event that a Blockstore database is lost.

Shut Down and Back Up |onprem|
------------------------------

To perform a full backup of all snapshots contained in |onprem|,
including the point-in-time restores:

.. tabs-platforms::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: debian

      Use this procedure to back up the |application| on hosts
      installed using ``deb`` packages:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/backup-om-linux.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: rhel

      Use this procedure to back up the |application| on hosts
      installed using ``rpm`` packages:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/backup-om-linux.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: linux

      Use this procedure to back up Linux systems that don't use
      ``deb`` or ``rpm`` packages.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/backup-om-linux.rst

While this procedure makes all of |onprem|'s backup snapshots *and* the
|pit| restores available, it involves significant downtime, During the
shutdown, |onprem|, monitoring, and automation are unavailable.

As a result, if one of your MongoDB instances fails:

- You may lose the data that |onprem| didn't back up prior to shutdown.
- You can't be alerted of the loss of data.
