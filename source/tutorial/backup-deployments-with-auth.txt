Backing up Clusters with Authentication
=======================================

Overview
--------

The Backup Agent supports MongoDB deployments that require authentication.
The agent receives configurations from replica sets, sharded clusters, and
hosts, as well as credentials from the MMS :guilabel:`Backup` tab for replica
sets and sharded clusters.

If you use |backup| with a MongoDB instance with authentication enabled, there
are additional steps you will need to take before you can use |backup|. The
Monitoring Agent also will need to be updated to monitor databases using
authentication.

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need to create a new user for the Backup Agent then install the Backup
Agent.

Use the :program:`mongo` shell to connect to the :program:`mongod` or
:program:`mongos` instance you will be backing up. Create a new user
for the |backup| Agent using the appropriate command shown in the
:doc:`Authentication Requirements </reference/authentication/>` page. Then
restart your replica set and sharded cluster with authentication enabled, as
appropriate.

You can now install the Backup Agent, as described in the procedures on the
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/backup-getting-started` page. You will need to
provide the username and password during the |backup| setup process.
