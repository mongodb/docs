Security
~~~~~~~~

Starting with MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB binaries, :binary:`mongod
<bin.mongod>` and :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`, bind to
``localhost`` by default.

When bound only to the localhost, these binaries can only accept
connections from clients that are running on the same machine. Remote
clients cannot connect to the binaries bound only to localhost. For
more information, including how to override and bind to other ip
addresses, see :ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`.
