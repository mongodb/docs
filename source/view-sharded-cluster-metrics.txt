A :manual:`sharded cluster </sharding>` is the set of nodes 
comprising a sharded MongoDB deployment. To view the metrics for a 
specific |mms| deployment in a :ref:`project <projects>`, click the 
:guilabel:`Metrics` button for that deployment. Alternatively, click on 
the name of the deployment to open the deployment overview, then click 
the :guilabel:`Metrics` tab.

The :guilabel:`Metrics` view has three distinct sections:

Chart Controls
--------------

|mms| provides the following controls for the
:guilabel:`Metric` view:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Control
     - Function

   * - :guilabel:`Granularity`
     - .. include:: /includes/extracts/monitor-view-control-granularity-sharded.rst

   * - :guilabel:`Zoom`
     - .. include:: /includes/extracts/monitor-view-control-zoom.rst

.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Task

Data Sources
------------

|mms| displays each data source that contributes to the metric
chart in a table below the chart. The table consists of the
following:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 65
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Column
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Shard Name`
     - When :guilabel:`View` is set to ``SHARDS``, displays the name
       of each shard in the sharded cluster deployment.

       When :guilabel:`View` is set to ``MONGOS`` or ``CONFIGS``,
       displays the name of each :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>` or
       config server :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` process in the
       sharded cluster deployment.

       Click on a listed component to open the
       :guilabel:`Metrics` view for that component.

   * - :guilabel:`Alerts`
     - Indicates if there are any open alerts for the listed
       shard or process. Click on the alert icon to open the
       :guilabel:`Alerts` view for that shard or process. To learn more 
       about responding to open alerts, see
       :doc:`/tutorial/manage-alerts-and-events`.

   * - :guilabel:`Data Size`
     - Only visible if :guilabel:`View` is set to ``SHARDS``.

       Indicates the logical size of all documents and indexes
       on the shard.

   * - :guilabel:`Show`
     - Only visible if :guilabel:`View` is set to ``SHARDS``

       Indicates which replica set members to show on the selected
       chart. Select ``Primaries``, ``Secondaries`` or ``All``.

   * - :guilabel:`Read`, :guilabel:`Write`, and :guilabel:`Queued`
     - Metric data related to the displayed chart. Hover over
       the corresponding column for a pop up with detailed
       information on the metrics shown.
