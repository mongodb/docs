Enable HTTPS
------------

The |k8s-op-short| supports configuring |onprem| to run over 
:ref:`HTTPS <config-https>`.

Enable |https| before deploying your |onprem| resources to avoid a situation 
where the |k8s-op-short| reports your resources' status as ``Failed``.

Enable TLS
----------

The |k8s-op-short| supports |tls| encryption.
Use |tls| with your MongoDB deployment to encrypt your data over
the network.

The configuration in the following example enables |tls| for the replica
set. When |tls| is enabled, all traffic between members of the replica
set and clients is encrypted using |tls| certificates.

To learn more about securing your MongoDB deployments using |tls|, see 
:ref:`secure-tls`.

The default |tls| mode is ``requireTLS``. You can customize it using the
:setting:`spec.additionalMongodConfig.net.ssl.mode` configuration
parameter, as shown in the following abbreviated example.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 15-18,21-24
   :linenos:
   
   apiVersion: mongodb.com/v1
   kind: MongoDB
   metadata:
   name: my-tls-enabled-rs
   spec:
     type: ReplicaSet
     members: 3
     version: 6.0.0-ent

    opsManager:
      configMapRef:
        name: my-project
    credentials: my-credentials

    security:
      tls:
        enabled: true
        ca: <custom-ca>

    ...
    additionalMongodConfig:
      net:
        ssl:
         mode: "preferSSL"

See the full |tls| configuration example in
:github:`replica-set.yaml </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/tree/master/samples/mongodb/tls/replica-set>`
in the :github:`TLS </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/tree/master/samples/mongodb/tls>`
samples directory. This directory also contains sample |tls| configurations for
sharded clusters and standalone deployments.
