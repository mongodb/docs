You can test the Realm React Native SDK with popular React Native testing libraries
like `Jest <https://jestjs.io/>`__, `Jasmine <https://jasmine.github.io/>`__,
and `Mocha <https://mochajs.org/>`__.

Clean Up Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When testing the Realm React Native SDK, you must close realms with
:realm-react-sdk:`Realm.close() <classes/Realm-1.html#close>` after you're done
with them to prevent memory leaks.

You should also delete the realm file  with :js-sdk:`Realm.deleteFile() <Realm.html#.deleteFile>`
during clean up to keep your tests idempotent.

The below example uses the Jest testing framework. It uses Jest's built-in ``beforeEach()``
and ``afterEach()`` hooks for test set up and tear down, respectively.
