======================================
Aggregation with the Zip Code Data Set
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The examples in this document use the ``zipcode`` collection. This
collection is available at: `media.mongodb.org/zips.json
<http://media.mongodb.org/zips.json>`_. Use :program:`mongoimport` to
load this data set into your :program:`mongod` instance.

Data Model
----------

Each document in the ``zipcode`` collection has the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id": "10280",
     "city": "NEW YORK",
     "state": "NY",
     "pop": 5574,
     "loc": [
       -74.016323,
       40.710537
     ]
   }

The ``_id`` field holds the zip code as a string.

The ``city`` field holds the city.

The ``state`` field holds the two letter state abbreviation.

The ``pop`` field holds the population.

The ``loc`` field holds the location as a latitude longitude pair.

All of the following examples use the :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>` helper in the :program:`mongo`
shell. :method:`aggregate() <db.collection.aggregate()>` provides a
wrapper around the :dbcommand:`aggregate` database command. See the
documentation for your :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>` for a
more idiomatic interface for data aggregation operations.

Return States with Populations above 10 Million
-----------------------------------------------

To return all states with a population greater than 10 million, use
the following aggregation operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.zipcodes.aggregate( { $group :
                            { _id : "$state",
                              totalPop : { $sum : "$pop" } } },
                          { $match : {totalPop : { $gte : 10*1000*1000 } } } )

Aggregations operations using the :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>` helper process all documents in the
``zipcodes`` collection. :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>` connects a number of :ref:`pipeline
<aggregation-pipeline>` operators, which define the aggregation
process.

In this example, the pipeline passes all documents in the
``zipcodes`` collection through the following steps:

- the :pipeline:`$group` operator collects all documents and
  creates documents for each state.

  These new per-state documents have one field in addition to the
  ``_id`` field: ``totalPop`` which is a generated field using the
  :group:`$sum` operation to calculate the total value of all
  ``pop`` fields in the source documents.

  After the :pipeline:`$group` operation the documents in the
  pipeline resemble the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "_id" : "AK",
       "totalPop" : 550043
     }

- the :pipeline:`$match` operation filters these documents so that
  the only documents that remain are those where the value of
  ``totalPop`` is greater than or equal to 10 million.

  The :pipeline:`$match` operation does not alter the documents,
  which have the same format as the documents output by
  :pipeline:`$group`.

The equivalent :term:`SQL` for this operation is:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT state, SUM(pop) AS totalPop
          FROM zipcodes
          GROUP BY state
          HAVING totalPop >= (10*1000*1000)

Return Average City Population by State
---------------------------------------

To return the average populations for cities in each state, use the
following aggregation operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.zipcodes.aggregate( { $group :
                            { _id : { state : "$state", city : "$city" },
                              pop : { $sum : "$pop" } } },
                          { $group :
                          { _id : "$_id.state",
                            avgCityPop : { $avg : "$pop" } } } )

Aggregations operations using the :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>` helper process all documents in the
``zipcodes`` collection. :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>`  connects a number of :ref:`pipeline
<aggregation-pipeline>` operators that define the aggregation
process.

In this example, the pipeline passes all documents in the
``zipcodes`` collection through the following steps:

- the :pipeline:`$group` operator collects all documents and
  creates new documents for every combination of the ``city`` and
  ``state`` fields in the source document.

  After this stage in the pipeline, the documents resemble the
  following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "_id" : {
         "state" : "CO",
         "city" : "EDGEWATER"
       },
       "pop" : 13154
     }

- the second :pipeline:`$group` operator collects documents by the
  ``state`` field and use the :group:`$avg` expression to
  compute a value for the ``avgCityPop`` field.

The final output of this aggregation operation is:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : "MN",
     "avgCityPop" : 5335
   },

.. commented until we get the SQL
   The equivalent :term:`SQL` for this operation is:

   .. code-block:: sql



Return Largest and Smallest Cities by State
-------------------------------------------

To return the smallest and largest cities by population for each
state, use the following aggregation operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.zipcodes.aggregate( { $group:
                            { _id: { state: "$state", city: "$city" },
                              pop: { $sum: "$pop" } } },
                          { $sort: { pop: 1 } },
                          { $group:
                            { _id : "$_id.state",
                              biggestCity:  { $last: "$_id.city" },
                              biggestPop:   { $last: "$pop" },
                              smallestCity: { $first: "$_id.city" },
                              smallestPop:  { $first: "$pop" } } },

                          // the following $project is optional, and
                          // modifies the output format.

                          { $project:
                            { _id: 0,
                              state: "$_id",
                              biggestCity:  { name: "$biggestCity",  pop: "$biggestPop" },
                              smallestCity: { name: "$smallestCity", pop: "$smallestPop" } } } )

Aggregation operations using the :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>` helper process all documents in the
``zipcodes`` collection. :method:`aggregate()
<db.collection.aggregate()>` combines a number of :ref:`pipeline
<aggregation-pipeline>` operators that define the aggregation
process.

All documents from the ``zipcodes`` collection pass into the pipeline,
which consists of the following steps:

- the :pipeline:`$group` operator collects all documents and
  creates new documents for every combination of the ``city`` and
  ``state`` fields in the source documents.

  By specifying the value of ``_id`` as a sub-document that contains
  both fields, the operation preserves the ``state`` field for use
  later in the pipeline. The documents produced by this stage of the
  pipeline have a second field, ``pop``, which uses the
  :group:`$sum` operator to provide the total of the ``pop``
  fields in the source document.

  At this stage in the pipeline, the documents resemble the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "_id" : {
         "state" : "CO",
         "city" : "EDGEWATER"
       },
       "pop" : 13154
     }

- :pipeline:`$sort` operator orders the documents in the pipeline
  based on the vale of the ``pop`` field from largest to
  smallest. This operation does not alter the documents.

- the second :pipeline:`$group` operator collects the documents in
  the pipeline by the ``state`` field, which is a field inside the
  nested ``_id`` document.

  Within each per-state document this :pipeline:`$group` operator
  specifies four fields: Using the :group:`$last` expression,
  the :pipeline:`$group` operator creates the ``biggestcity`` and
  ``biggestpop`` fields that store the city with the largest
  population and that population. Using the :group:`$first`
  expression, the :pipeline:`$group` operator creates the
  ``smallestcity`` and ``smallestpop`` fields that store the city with
  the smallest population and that population.

  The documents, at this stage in the pipeline resemble the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "_id" : "WA",
       "biggestCity" : "SEATTLE",
       "biggestPop" : 520096,
       "smallestCity" : "BENGE",
       "smallestPop" : 2
     }

- The final operation is :pipeline:`$project`, which renames the
  ``_id`` field to ``state`` and moves the ``biggestCity``,
  ``biggestPop``, ``smallestCity``, and ``smallestPop`` into
  ``biggestCity`` and ``smallestCity`` sub-documents.

The output of this aggregation operation is:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "state" : "RI",
     "biggestCity" : {
       "name" : "CRANSTON",
       "pop" : 176404
     },
     "smallestCity" : {
       "name" : "CLAYVILLE",
       "pop" : 45
     }
   }

   The equivalent :term:`SQL` for this operation is:

   .. code-block:: sql
