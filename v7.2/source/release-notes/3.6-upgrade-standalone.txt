Default Bind to Localhost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances bind to localhost by default. Remote clients cannot connect
to an instance bound only to localhost. To override and bind to other
ip addresses, use the :setting:`net.bindIp` configuration file setting
or the ``--bind_ip`` command-line option to specify a list of ip
addresses.

The upgrade process will require that you specify the
:setting:`net.bindIp` setting if you wish remote clients to connect to
your instance.

.. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

For more information, see :ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`.

Prerequisites
-------------

The |oldversion| instance must have ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set
to ``3.4``. To check ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

The operation should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion": "3.4"``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the following
command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4" } )

For more information, see :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Download |newversion| Binaries
