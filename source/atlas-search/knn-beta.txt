Definition
----------

.. expression:: knnBeta 

   The ``knnBeta`` operator uses |hnsw| algorithm to perform semantic 
   search. You can use |fts| support for :abbr:`kNN (K-nearest 
   neighbors)` query to search similar to a selected product, search 
   for images, etc.

.. _knn-beta-syntax:

Syntax 
------

``knnBeta`` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: json
   :linenos:

   {
     $search: {
       "index": "<index name>", // optional, defaults to "default"
       "knnBeta": {
         "vector": [<array-of-numbers>],
         "path": "<field-to-search>",
         "filter": {<filter-specification>},
         "k": <number>,
         "score": {<options>}
       }
     }
   }

.. _knn-beta-options:

Options 
-------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 60 10 

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Necessity

   * - ``filter``
     - document
     - Any |fts| :ref:`operator <operators-ref>` to filter the 
       documents based on metadata or certain search criteria, which 
       can help narrow down the scope of vector search.
     - Optional

   * - ``k``
     - number
     - Number of nearest neighbors to return. You can specify a number 
       higher than the number of documents to return 
       (:pipeline:`$limit`) to increase accuracy. 
     - Required

   * - ``path``
     - string
     - Indexed :ref:`knnVector <fts-data-types-knn-vector>` type field
       to search. See :ref:`Path Construction <ref-path>` for more
       information. 
     - Required

   * - ``score`` 
     - document
     - Score assigned to matching documents in the results. To learn
       more, see :ref:`scoring behavior <knn-beta-scoring>`.
     - Optional

   * - ``vector``
     - array of numbers
     - Array of numbers of |bson| types ``int`` or ``double`` that 
       represent the query vector. The array size must match the number 
       of vector ``dimensions`` specified in the :ref:`index 
       <fts-data-types-knn-vector>` for the field.
     - Required

.. _knn-beta-behavior:

Behavior 
--------

You can run :abbr:`kNN (K-nearest neighbors)` queries against fields 
that were indexed as |fts| type :ref:`knnVector
<fts-data-types-knn-vector>` only. 

You can use :pipeline:`$limit` after the :pipeline:`$search` stage
to limit the number of documents in the ``knnBeta`` query results. We
recommend setting the value for ``k`` higher than the value for
``$limit``. This overrequest pattern is the main way to trade off latency and recall in your 
approximate nearest neighbor searches. Empirically, we have seen a multiplier of 5-10 work
well for many use cases, but we recommend tuning this on your specific dataset.

.. example:: 

   The following query finds ``150`` nearest neighbors to the query and
   limits the remaining number of results to ``50``. 

   .. code-block:: json 
      :copyable: false 
      :linenos:

      db.<collection>.aggregate({
        "$search": {
          "knnBeta": {
            "vector": <array-of-numbers-to-search>,
            "path": <indexed-field-to-search>,
            "k": 150
          }
        } 
      },
      {
        "$limit": 50
      })

.. _knn-beta-usage:

Performance 
~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve query performance, use the :pipeline:`$project` stage to
select the fields to return in the results, unless you need all the
fields in the results. We recommend excluding the vector field in
the :pipeline:`$project` stage.

.. _knn-beta-scoring:

Scoring  
~~~~~~~

You can use the ``score`` field with the :manual:`$meta
</reference/operator/aggregation/meta/>` expression ``searchScore`` in
the :pipeline:`$project` stage to return the score for the documents in
the results.

|fts| scores the results for :abbr:`kNN (K-nearest neighbors)` queries 
in a fixed range from ``0`` to ``1`` only. For ``cosine`` and
``dotProduct`` :ref:`similarities <fts-knn-vector-type-options>`, |fts|
normalizes the score using the following algorithm:

.. code-block:: shell 
   :copyable: false 

   score = (1 + cosine/dot_product(v1,v2)) / 2

.. _knn-beta-limitation:

Limitations 
~~~~~~~~~~~

``knnBeta`` operator must be the top-level operator in your queries and
therefore, you can't use the ``knnBeta`` operator inside the following:  

- :ref:`embedded-document-ref` operator 
- :ref:`compound-ref` operator  
- :ref:`fts-facet-ref` collector

You can't use the ``knnBeta`` operator to query fields indexed using a 
:ref:`vectorSearch <avs-types-vector-search>` type index. You can't use
the :pipeline:`$search` :ref:`sort <sort-ref>` option with the
``knnBeta`` operator. 

We don't recommend paginating your |fts| results using :pipeline:`$skip`
and :pipeline:`$limit` after the :pipeline:`$search` stage. 

.. _knn-beta-egs:

Examples 
--------

The following queries search the sample ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies``
collection using the ``knnBeta`` operator. The queries search the 
``plot_embedding`` field, which contains embeddings created using OpenAI's
``text-embedding-ada-002`` embeddings model. If you added the :ref:`sample
collection <mflix-embedded_movies>` to your |service| cluster and
created the :ref:`sample index definition <knn-vector-egs>` for the
collection, you can switch to the ``sample_mflix`` database and run the
following queries against the collection.  

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Basic Example 
      :tabid: basic 

      The following query searches the ``plot_embedding`` field using the 
      ``knnBeta`` operator for ``vector`` dimensions and requests up 
      to ``5`` nearest neighbors in the results. The query also
      specifies a :pipeline:`$project` stage to: 

      - Exclude the ``_id`` field and include ``plot`` and ``title``
        fields in the results. 
      - Add a field named ``score`` in the results.

   .. tab:: Filter Example 
      :tabid: filter 

      The following query filters the documents for movies released 
      before or on (``≤``) 30 June, 1971 (``1971-06-30``), then searches
      the ``plot_embedding`` field in the filtered documents for
      ``vector`` dimensions, and requests up to ``5`` nearest neighbors
      in the results. The query also specifies a :pipeline:`$project`
      stage to: 

      - Exclude the ``_id`` field and include only ``plot``, ``title``,
        and ``released`` fields in the results.
      - Add a field named ``score`` in the results.
