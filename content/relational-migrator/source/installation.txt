.. _rm-install-scenario-desktop:

Local Desktop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install {+rel-mig+} to a single machine that cannot be externally accessed.
Local installations are suitable for development, evaluation, and small production jobs 
that are expected to run for less than one day.

.. note:: 
  
   If you must perform a large migration, you can split the migration into multiple 
   jobs using :ref:`table filters <rm-table-filters>`.


For more information, see :ref:`<local-machine-install>`.

.. _rm-install-scenario-server:

Unattended Server/VM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install {+rel-mig+} on an unattended server or :abbr:`VM (Virtual Machine)` 
that binds {+rel-mig+} to an IP address and port, exposing it as a web application.
Installing {+rel-mig+} on an unattended server is suitable for the majority of use cases, 
including tests and production migrations.

.. note::
   
   Installing {+rel-mig+} on an unattended server is not a highly-available solution. 
   If an application issue occurs, users must manually intervene. 

For more information, see :ref:`<unattended-server>`.

.. _rm-install-scenario-kafka:

Kafka Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Apache Kafka <https://kafka.apache.org/>`__ is an open-source platform for distributed 
workloads. If you use {+rel-mig+} for critical production workloads or long-running 
:abbr:`CDC (Change Data Capture)` syncs, MongoDB recommends using Kafka. Using {+rel-mig+}
as a Kafka Connect plugin can enable high availability and automatic failure recovery, provided
that the underlying cluster configuration supports these features.

For more information, see :ref:`kafka-intro`.

.. _rm-install-scenario-confluent:

Kafka on Confluent Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Confluent  <https://www.confluent.io/>`__ is an official MongoDB partner providing 
a fully-managed cloud-based Kafka solution. This deployment method is intended for users
who want the reliability of Kafka without having to manage their own cluster.

For more information, see :ref:`install-confluent-kafka`.
