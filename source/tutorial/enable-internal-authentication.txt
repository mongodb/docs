Overview
--------

When authentication is enabled on a replica set or a sharded cluster, members
of the replica set or the sharded clusters must provide credentials to
authenticate.

To enable authentication on a replica set or a sharded cluster, you must
enable authentication individually for each member. For a sharded
cluster, this means enabling authentication on each :binary:`~bin.mongos` and
each :binary:`~bin.mongod`, including the config servers and each member of a
shard's replica set.

The following tutorial uses a :ref:`keyfile <internal-auth-keyfile>` to
enable internal authentication. You can also use x.509 certificate for
internal authentication. For details on using x.509, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-member-authentication`.

Considerations
--------------

Access Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enabling internal authentication enables :doc:`access control
</core/authorization>`. The following tutorial assumes *no* users have
been created in the system before enabling internal authentication, and
uses :ref:`localhost-exception` to add a user administrator after access
control has been enabled. 

If you prefer, you can create the users before enabling internal
authentication.

Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not possible to convert an existing sharded cluster that does
not enforce access control to require authentication without taking
all components of the cluster offline for a short period of time.

For sharded clusters, the :ref:`localhost-exception` will apply to the
individual shards unless you either create an administrative user or
disable the localhost exception on each shard.

x.509 Internal Authentication
-----------------------------

For details on using x.509 for internal authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-member-authentication`.

To upgrade from keyfile internal authentication to x.509 internal
authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-keyfile-to-x509`.
