Deploy a Standalone MongoDB Instance

Overview
--------

You can deploy a :term:`standalone` MongoDB instance managed by |mms|. Use
standalone instances for testing and development.
**Do not** use these deployments, which lack replication and high
availability, for production systems. For all production deployments
use replica sets. See :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set` for
production deployments.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must have an existing server to which to deploy.
