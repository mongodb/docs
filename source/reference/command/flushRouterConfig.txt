.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: flushRouterConfig

   :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` clears the current cluster
   information cached by a :program:`mongos` instance and reloads all
   :term:`sharded cluster` metadata from the :term:`config database`.

   This forces an update when the configuration database holds data
   that is newer than the data cached in the :program:`mongos`
   process.

   .. warning::

      Do not modify the config data, except as explicitly
      documented. A config database cannot typically tolerate manual
      manipulation.

   :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig` is an administrative command that is
   only available for :program:`mongos` instances.

   .. versionadded:: 1.8.2
