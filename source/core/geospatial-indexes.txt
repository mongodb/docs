Overview
--------

``2d`` geospatial indexes make it possible to associate documents with
locations in two-dimensional space, such as a point on a map. MongoDB
interprets two-dimensional coordinates in a location field as points
and can index these points in a special index type to support
location-based queries. Geospatial indexes provide special geospatial
query operators. For example, you can query for documents based on
proximity to another location or based on inclusion in a specified
region.

Geospatial indexes support queries on both the coordinate field *and*
another field, such as a type of business or attraction. For example,
you might write a query to find restaurants a specific distance from a
hotel or to find museums within a certain defined neighborhood.

This document describes how to store location data in your documents
and how to create geospatial indexes. For information on querying data
stored in geospatial indexes, see :doc:`/applications/geospatial-indexes`.

.. _geospatial-indexes-coordinates:

Store Location Data
-------------------

To use ``2d`` geospatial indexes, you must model location data on a
predetermined two-dimensional coordinate system, such as longitude
and latitude. You store a document's location data as two coordinates
in a field that holds either a two-dimensional array or an embedded
document with two fields. Consider the following two examples:

.. code-block:: javascript

   loc : [ x, y ]

   loc : { x: 1, y: 2 }

All documents must store location data in the same order. If
you use latitude and longitude as your coordinate system, always store
longitude first. MongoDB's :ref:`2d spherical index operators
<geospatial-indexes-spherical>` only recognize ``[ longitude, latitude]``
ordering.

Considerations
--------------

With the :dbcommand:`geoNear` command, a collection can have only one
``2d`` index. With :ref:`geospatial query operators
<geolocation-operators>` such as :query:`$near` operator, a collection
can have multiple geospatial indexes.

.. _geospatial-indexes-create:

Create a Geospatial Index
-------------------------

To create a geospatial index, use the :method:`ensureIndex
<db.collection.ensureIndex()>` method with the value ``2d`` for the
location field of your collection. Consider the following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { <location field> : "2d" } )

MongoDB's :ref:`geospatial operations
<geospatial-query-operators>` use this index when querying for location
data.

When you create the index, MongoDB converts location data to binary
:term:`geohash` values and calculates these values using the location
data and the index's location range, as described in
:ref:`geospatial-indexes-range`. The default range for ``2d`` indexes
assumes longitude and latitude and uses the bounds -180 inclusive and
180 non-inclusive.

.. important:: The default boundaries of ``2d`` indexes allow
   applications to insert documents with invalid latitudes greater
   than 90 or less than -90. The behavior of geospatial queries with
   such invalid points is not defined.

When creating a ``2d`` index, MongoDB provides the following options:

.. _geospatial-indexes-range:

Location Range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All ``2d`` geospatial indexes have boundaries defined by a coordinate
range. By default, ``2d`` geospatial indexes assume longitude and
latitude have boundaries of -180 inclusive and 180 non-inclusive
(i.e. ``[-180, 180)``). MongoDB returns an error and rejects documents
with coordinate data outside of the specified range.

To build an index with a location range other than the
default, use the ``min`` and ``max`` options with the
:method:`ensureIndex() <db.collection.ensureIndex()>` operation when
creating a ``2d`` index, as in the following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { <location field>: "2d" } ,
                              { min: <lower bound> , max: <upper bound> } )

.. _geospatial-indexes-precision:

Location Precision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``2d`` indexes use a :ref:`geohash <geospatial-indexes-geohash>`
representation of all coordinate data internally. Geohashes have a
precision that is determined by the number of bits in the hash. More bits
allow the index to provide results with greater precision, while fewer
bits mean the index provides results with more limited
precision.

Indexes with lower precision have a lower processing overhead for
insert operations and will consume less space. However, higher
precision indexes means that queries will need to scan smaller
portions of the index to return results. The actual stored values are
always used in the final query processing, and index precision does
not affect query accuracy.

By default, geospatial indexes use 26 bits of precision, which is
roughly equivalent to 2 feet or about 60 centimeters of precision
using the default range of -180 to 180. You can configure ``2d``
geospatial indexes with up to 32 bits of precision.

To configure a location precision other than the default, use the
``bits`` option in the :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` method,
as in the following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( {<location field>: "2d"} ,
                              { bits: <bit precision> } )

For more information on the relationship between bits and precision,
see :ref:`geospatial-indexes-geohash`.

Compound Geospatial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``2d`` geospatial indexes may be :ref:`compound
<index-type-compound>`, if and only if the field with location data is
the first field. A compound geospatial index makes it possible to
construct queries that primarily select on a location-based field but
also select on a second criteria. For example, you could use such
an index to support queries for carpet wholesalers within a specific
region.

.. note:: Geospatial queries will *only* use additional query
   parameters after applying the geospatial criteria. If your
   geospatial query criteria selects a large number of
   documents, the additional query will only filter the result set
   and *not* result in a more targeted query.

To create a geospatial index with two fields, specify the location field
first, then the second field. For example, to create a compound index on
the ``loc`` location field and on the ``product`` field (sorted in
ascending order), you would issue the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.storeInfo.ensureIndex( { loc: "2d", product: 1 } );

This creates an index that supports queries on just the location field
(i.e. ``loc``), as well as queries on both the ``loc`` and
``product``.

.. _geospatial-indexes-haystack-index:

Haystack Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Haystack indexes create "buckets" of documents from the same geographic
area in order to improve performance for queries limited to that area.

Each bucket in a haystack index contains all the documents within a
specified proximity to a given longitude and latitude. Use the
``bucketSize`` parameter of :method:`ensureIndex()
<db.collection.ensureIndex()>` to determine proximity. A
``bucketSize`` of ``5`` creates an index that groups location values
that are within 5 units of the specified longitude and latitude.

``bucketSize`` also determines the granularity of the index. You can
tune the parameter to the distribution of your data so that in general
you search only very small regions of a two-dimensional
space. Furthermore, the areas defined by buckets can overlap. As a
result a document can exist in multiple buckets.

To build a haystack index, use the ``bucketSize`` parameter in the
:method:`ensureIndex() <db.collection.ensureIndex()>` method, as in the
following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex({ <location field>: "geoHaystack", type: 1 },
                             { bucketSize: <bucket value> })

.. example::

   Consider a collection with documents that contain fields similar to
   the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { _id : 100, pos: { long : 126.9, lat : 35.2 }, type : "restaurant"}
      { _id : 200, pos: { long : 127.5, lat : 36.1 }, type : "restaurant"}
      { _id : 300, pos: { long : 128.0, lat : 36.7 }, type : "national park"}

   The following operations creates a haystack index with buckets that
   store keys within 1 unit of longitude or latitude.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.ensureIndex( { pos : "geoHaystack", type : 1 }, { bucketSize : 1 } )

   Therefore, this index stores the document with an ``_id`` field
   that has the value ``200`` in two
   different buckets:

   1. in a bucket that includes the document  where the ``_id`` field
      has a value of ``100``, and

   2. in a bucket that includes the document where the ``_id`` field
      has a value of ``300``.

To query using a haystack index you use the :dbcommand:`geoSearch`
command. For command details, see :ref:`geospatial-indexes-haystack-queries`.

Haystack indexes are ideal for returning documents based on location
*and* an exact match on a *single* additional criteria. These indexes
are not necessarily suited to returning the closest documents to a
particular location.

:ref:`Spherical queries <geospatial-indexes-spherical>` are not
supported by geospatial haystack indexes.

By default, queries that use a haystack index return 50 documents.

.. _geospatial-indexes-distance-calculation:

Distance Calculation
--------------------

MongoDB performs distance calculations before performing ``2d``
geospatial queries. By default, MongoDB uses flat geometry to
calculate distances between points. MongoDB also supports distance
calculations using spherical geometry, to provide accurate distances
for geospatial information based on a sphere or earth.

.. admonition:: Spherical Queries Use Radians for Distance

   For spherical operators to function properly, you must convert
   distances to radians, and convert from radians to the distances units
   used by your application.

   To convert:

   - *distance to radians*: divide the distance by the radius of the
     sphere (e.g. the Earth) in the same units as the distance
     measurement.

   - *radians to distance*: multiply the radian measure by the radius
     of the sphere (e.g. the Earth) in the units system that you want to
     convert the distance to.

   The radius of the Earth is approximately ``3963.192`` miles or
   ``6378.137`` kilometers.

The following query would return documents from the ``places``
collection within the circle described by the center ``[ -74, 40.74 ]``
with a radius of ``100`` miles:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find( { loc: { $within: { $centerSphere: [ [ -74, 40.74 ] ,
                                                        100 / 3963.192 ] } } } )

You may also use the ``distanceMultiplier`` option to the
:dbcommand:`geoNear` to convert radians in the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
process, rather than in your application code. Please see the
:ref:`distance multiplier <geospatial-indexes-distance-multiplier>` section.

The following spherical ``2d`` query, returns all documents in the
collection ``places`` within ``100`` miles from the point ``[ -74,
40.74 ]``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { geoNear: "places",
                    near: [ -74, 40.74 ],
                    spherical: true
                  }  )

The output of the above command would be:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      // [ ... ]
      "results" : [
         {
            "dis" : 0.01853688938212826,
            "obj" : {
               "_id" : ObjectId( ... )
               "loc" : [
                  -73,
                  40
               ]
            }
         }
      ],
      "stats" : {
         // [ ... ]
         "avgDistance" : 0.01853688938212826,
         "maxDistance" : 0.01853714811400047
      },
      "ok" : 1
   }

.. warning::

   Spherical queries that wrap around the poles or at the transition
   from ``-180`` to ``180`` longitude raise an error.

.. note::

   While the default Earth-like bounds for geospatial indexes are
   between ``-180`` inclusive, and ``180``, valid values for latitude
   are between ``-90`` and ``90``.

.. _geospatial-indexes-geohash:

Geohash Values
--------------

To create a geospatial index, MongoDB computes the :term:`geohash`
value for coordinate pairs within the specified :ref:`range
<geospatial-indexes-range>` and indexes the geohash for that point .

To calculate a geohash value, continuously divide a 2D map into
quadrants. Then assign each quadrant a two-bit value. For example, a
two-bit representation of four quadrants would be:

.. code-block:: javascript

   01  11

   00  10

These two-bit values (``00``, ``01``, ``10``, and ``11``) represent each
of the quadrants and all points within each quadrant. For a geohash with
two bits of resolution, all points in the bottom left quadrant would
have a geohash of ``00``. The top left quadrant would have the geohash
of ``01``. The bottom right and top right would have a geohash of ``10``
and ``11``, respectively.

To provide additional precision, continue dividing each quadrant into
sub-quadrants. Each sub-quadrant would have the geohash value of the
containing quadrant concatenated with the value of the sub-quadrant. The
geohash for the upper-right quadrant is ``11``, and the geohash for the
sub-quadrants would be (clockwise from the top left): ``1101``,
``1111``, ``1110``, and ``1100``, respectively.

To calculate a more precise geohash, continue dividing the sub-quadrant
and concatenate the two-bit identifier for each division. The more
"bits" in the hash identifier for a given point, the smaller possible
area that the hash can describe and the higher the resolution of the
geospatial index.

Geospatial Indexes and Sharding
-------------------------------

You *cannot* use a geospatial index as a :term:`shard key` when
sharding a collection. However, you *can* create and maintain a
geospatial index on a sharded collection by using a different field as
the shard key. Your application may query for geospatial data using
:dbcommand:`geoNear` and :query:`$within`. However, queries using
:query:`$near` are not supported for sharded collections.

.. _geospatial-indexes-multi-location:

Multi-location Documents
------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0
   Support for multiple locations in a document.

While ``2d`` indexes do not support more than one set of coordinates in
a document, you can use a :ref:`multi-key indexes <index-type-multi-key>`
to store and index multiple coordinate pairs in a single document. In the
simplest example you may have a field (e.g. ``locs``) that holds an
array of coordinates, as in the following prototype data
model:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "_id": ObjectId(...),
    "locs": [
              [ 55.5, 42.3 ],
              [ -74, 44.74 ],
              { "lat": 55.3, "long": 40.2 }
            ]
   }

The values of the array may either be arrays holding coordinates, as
in ``[ 55.5, 42.3 ]``, or embedded documents, as in ``{ "lat": 55.3,
"long": 40.2 }``.

You could then create a geospatial index on the ``locs`` field, as in
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.ensureIndex( { "locs": "2d" } )

You may also model the location data as a field inside of a
sub-document. In this case, the document would contain a field
(e.g. ``addresses``) that holds an array of documents where each
document has a field (e.g. ``loc:``) that holds location
coordinates. Consider the following prototype data model:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "_id": ObjectId(...),
    "name": "...",
    "addresses": [
                   {
                    "context": "home",
                    "loc": [ 55.5, 42.3 ]
                   },
                   {
                    "context": "home",
                    "loc": [ -74, 44.74 ]
                   }
                 ]
   }

You could then create the geospatial index on the ``addresses.loc`` field as
in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.ensureIndex( { "addresses.loc": "2d" } )

For documents with multiple coordinate values, queries may return the
same document multiple times if more than one indexed coordinate pair
satisfies the query constraints. Use the ``uniqueDocs`` parameter to
:dbcommand:`geoNear` or the :query:`$uniqueDocs` operator in
conjunction with :query:`$within`.

To include the location field with the distance field in
multi-location document queries, specify ``includeLocs: true``
in the :dbcommand:`geoNear` command.
