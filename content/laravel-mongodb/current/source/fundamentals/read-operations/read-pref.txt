Set a Read Preference
---------------------

To specify which replica set members receive your read operations,
set a read preference by using the ``readPreference()`` method.

The ``readPreference()`` method accepts the following parameters:
 
- ``mode``: *(Required)* A string value specifying the read preference
  mode.

- ``tagSets``: *(Optional)* An array value specifying key-value tags that correspond to 
  certain replica set members.

- ``options``: *(Optional)* An array value specifying additional read preference options.

.. tip::

   To view a full list of available read preference modes and options, see
   :php:`MongoDB\Driver\ReadPreference::__construct </manual/en/mongodb-driver-readpreference.construct.php>`
   in the MongoDB PHP extension documentation.

The following example queries for documents in which the value of the ``title``
field is ``"Carrie"`` and sets the read preference to ``ReadPreference::SECONDARY_PREFERRED``.
As a result, the query retrieves the results from secondary replica set
members or the primary member if no secondaries are available:

   .. tab:: Query Syntax
      :tabid: query-syntax

      Use the following syntax to specify the query:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/read-operations/ReadOperationsTest.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-read-pref
         :end-before: end-read-pref

   .. tab:: Controller Method
      :tabid: controller

      To see the query results in the ``browse_movies`` view, edit the ``show()`` function
      in the ``MovieController.php`` file to resemble the following code:

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: php

            class MovieController
            {
                public function show()
                {
                   $movies = Movie::where('title', 'Carrie')
                        ->readPreference(ReadPreference::SECONDARY_PREFERRED)
                        ->get();

                    return view('browse_movies', [
                        'movies' => $movies
                    ]);
                }
            }

         .. output::
            :language: none
            :visible: false
