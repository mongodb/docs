For data stored in :atlas:`{+atlas+} </>`, you can use the 
:atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>` |search-operator| 
operator when running :pipeline:`$search` queries. Running 
|manual-operator| after :pipeline:`$search` is less performant 
than running :pipeline:`$search` with the |search-operator|
operator.

To learn more about the Atlas Search version of this operator, 
see the |search-operator| operator in the Atlas documentation.
