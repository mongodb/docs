Overview
--------

|mms| provides a wizard for adding your existing MongoDB deployments to
monitoring and management. The wizard prompts you to install an Automation
Agent if none exists, and then prompts you to identify the :term:`cluster
<sharded cluster>`, the :term:`replica set`, or the :term:`standalone` to add. You
can choose to add the deployment to :ref:`Monitoring
<monitoring-functional-overview>` or to both :ref:`Monitoring
<monitoring-functional-overview>` and :ref:`Automation
<automation>`.

Considerations
--------------

Unique Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deployments must have unique names within the projects.

Preferred Hostnames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the MongoDB process is accessible only by specific hostname or IP
address, or if you need to specify the hostname to use for servers with
multiple aliases, set up a preferred hostname. For details, see the
:guilabel:`Preferred Hostnames` setting in :ref:`group-settings-page`.

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- When adding to Monitoring:
    If your MongoDB deployment requires authentication, you must
    provide the necessary credentials for monitoring when adding the
    deployment to |mms|. For information on configuring authentication,
    see :doc:`/tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials`.

- When adding to Automation:
    If the |mms| project has MongoDB authentication settings enabled for
    its deployments, the MongoDB deployment to import must support the
    projects's authentication mechanism.

    If either the MongoDB deployment requires authentication or
    the |mms| project has authentication settings enabled, you must add
    an automation user with the appropriate roles to the MongoDB
    process in order to perform the import. If the |mms| project has
    authentication settings enabled, add the |mms| project's automation
    user to the MongoDB process. See
    :ref:`add-existing-mongodb-prerequisites`.
