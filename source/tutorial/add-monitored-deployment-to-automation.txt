Overview
--------

|mms| Automation lets you deploy, reconfigure and upgrade your MongoDB
databases directly from the |mms| console.

If |mms| is already monitoring your MongoDB processes, you can add them
to Automation.

Automation relies on the Automation Agent, which you install on each
server that hosts a process to be added to automated management. The
Automation Agents regularly poll |mms| to determine goal configuration
and deploy changes as needed.

Considerations
--------------

Automation supports most but not all available MongoDB options. See
:doc:`/reference/cluster-configuration-process-options` for supported
MongoDB deployment options.

When adding a MongoDB deployment requiring authentication, you have the
option of importing that process's users and roles. During import,
|mms| prompts you to resolve any conflicts that may occur between the
imported users and roles and the managed users and roles.

Prerequisites
-------------

|mms| is Monitoring the Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| must be currently monitoring the MongoDB processes, and the
Monitoring Agent must be running. The processes must appear on the
|mms| :guilabel:`Deployment` page.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes` to enable |mms| to
   automate and monitor your MongoDB processes if |mms| does not
   currently do so. 

Before proceeding, please ensure that your deployment meets the  
:doc:`/tutorial/provisioning-prep`.
