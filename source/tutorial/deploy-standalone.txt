====================================
Deploy a Standalone MongoDB Instance
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MMS lets you deploy and monitor :term:`standalone` MongoDB instances. A
standalone instance is useful for testing but is not recommended for
production environments.

This tutorial describes how to deploy a standalone instance that is
managed by MMS. After deployment, you can use MMS to monitor and manage
the instance.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must have an existing server to which to deploy. You can use your
localhost or another machine to which you have access. You can also use a
server on Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use MMS to provision a new
server on AWS, as described in :doc:`/tutorial/add-server`.
