The bounds of an index scan define which portions of an index are searched during a query. When multiple predicates exist over an index, MongoDB
will attempt to combine the bounds for these predicates, by either
*intersection* or *compounding*, in order to produce a scan with smaller
bounds.

.. _multikey-index-bounds-intersecting:

Intersect Bounds for Multikey Index
-----------------------------------

Bounds intersection refers to a logical conjunction (i.e. ``AND``) of
multiple bounds. For instance, given two bounds ``[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]``
and ``[ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ]``, the intersection of the bounds results in
``[ [ 3, 6 ] ]``.

Given an :ref:`indexed <index-type-multikey>` array field, consider a
query that specifies multiple predicates on the array and can use a
:ref:`multikey index <index-type-multikey>`. MongoDB can intersect
:ref:`multikey index <index-type-multikey>` bounds if an
:query:`$elemMatch` joins the predicates.

For example, a collection ``survey`` contains documents with a field
``item`` and an array field ``ratings``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, item: "ABC", ratings: [ 2, 9 ] }
   { _id: 2, item: "XYZ", ratings: [ 4, 3 ] }

Create a :ref:`multikey index <index-type-multikey>` on the ``ratings``
array:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey.createIndex( { ratings: 1 } )

The following query uses :query:`$elemMatch` to set a requirement that the array
contains at least one *single* element that matches both conditions:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey.find( { ratings : { $elemMatch: { $gte: 3, $lte: 6 } } } )

Taking the predicates separately:

- the bounds for the greater than or equal to 3 predicate (i.e. ``$gte:
  3``) are ``[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]``;

- the bounds for the less than or equal to 6 predicate (i.e. ``$lte:
  6``) are ``[ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ]``.

Because the query uses :query:`$elemMatch` to join these predicates,
MongoDB can intersect the bounds to:

.. code-block:: javascript

   ratings: [ [ 3, 6 ] ]

If the query does *not* join the conditions on the array field with
:query:`$elemMatch`, MongoDB cannot intersect the multikey index
bounds. Consider the following query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey.find( { ratings : { $gte: 3, $lte: 6 } } )

The query searches the ``ratings`` array for at least one element
greater than or equal to 3, and at least one element less than or equal
to 6. Because a single element does not need to meet both criteria,
MongoDB does *not* intersect the bounds and uses either ``[ [ 3,
Infinity ] ]`` or ``[ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ]``. MongoDB makes no guarantee
as to which of these two bounds it selects.

Compound Bounds for Multikey Index
----------------------------------

Compounding bounds refers to using bounds for multiple keys of a
:ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>`. For instance, given a
compound index ``{ a: 1, b: 1 }`` with bounds on field ``a`` of ``[ [
3, Infinity ] ]`` and bounds on field ``b`` of ``[ [ -Infinity, 6 ]
]``, compounding the bounds results in the use of both bounds:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { a: [ [ 3, Infinity ] ], b: [ [ -Infinity, 6 ] ] }

If MongoDB cannot compound the two bounds, MongoDB always constrains
the index scan by the bound on its leading field, in this case, ``a:
[ [ 3, Infinity ] ]``.

Compound Index on an Array Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider a compound multikey index; i.e. a :ref:`compound index
<index-type-compound>` where one of the indexed fields is an array. For
example, a collection ``survey`` contains documents with a field
``item`` and an array field ``ratings``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, item: "ABC", ratings: [ 2, 9 ] }
   { _id: 2, item: "XYZ", ratings: [ 4, 3 ] }

Create a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` on the ``item``
field and the ``ratings`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey.createIndex( { item: 1, ratings: 1 } )

The following query specifies a condition on both keys of the index:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey.find( { item: "XYZ", ratings: { $gte: 3 } } )

Taking the predicates separately:

- the bounds for the ``item: "XYZ"`` predicate are ``[ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ] ]``;

- the bounds for the ``ratings: { $gte: 3 }`` predicate are ``[ [ 3,
  Infinity ] ]``.

MongoDB can compound the two bounds to use the combined bounds of:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { item: [ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ] ], ratings: [ [ 3, Infinity ] ] }

Compound Index on Fields from an Array of Embedded Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an array contains embedded documents, to index on fields contained
in the embedded documents, use the :ref:`dotted field name
<document-dot-notation>` in the index specification. For instance,
given the following array of embedded documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   ratings: [ { score: 2, by: "mn" }, { score: 9, by: "anon" } ]

The dotted field name for the ``score`` field is ``"ratings.score"``.

Compound Bounds of Non-array Field and Field from an Array
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Consider a collection ``survey2`` contains documents with a field
``item`` and an array field ``ratings``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: 1,
     item: "ABC",
     ratings: [ { score: 2, by: "mn" }, { score: 9, by: "anon" } ]
   }
   {
     _id: 2,
     item: "XYZ",
     ratings: [ { score: 5, by: "anon" }, { score: 7, by: "wv" } ]
   }

Create a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` on the non-array
field ``item``, as well as two fields from an array ``ratings.score`` and
``ratings.by``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey2.createIndex( { "item": 1, "ratings.score": 1, "ratings.by": 1 } )

The following query specifies a condition on all three fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey2.find( { item: "XYZ",  "ratings.score": { $lte: 5 }, "ratings.by": "anon" } )

Taking the predicates separately:

- the bounds for the ``item: "XYZ"`` predicate are ``[ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ] ]``;

- the bounds for the ``score: { $lte: 5 }`` predicate are ``[ [ -Infinity, 5
  ] ]``;

- the bounds for the ``by: "anon"`` predicate are ``[ "anon", "anon" ]``.

MongoDB can compound the bounds for the ``item`` key with *either* the
bounds for ``"ratings.score"`` or the bounds for ``"ratings.by"``,
depending upon the query predicates and the index key values. MongoDB
makes no guarantee as to which bounds it compounds with the ``item``
field. For instance, MongoDB will either choose to compound the
``item`` bounds with the ``"ratings.score"`` bounds:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2-3

   {
     "item" : [ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ] ],
     "ratings.score" : [ [ -Infinity, 5 ] ],
     "ratings.by" : [ [ MinKey, MaxKey ] ]
   }

Or, MongoDB may choose to compound the ``item`` bounds with
``"ratings.by"`` bounds:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2, 4

   {
     "item" : [ [ "XYZ", "XYZ" ] ],
     "ratings.score" : [ [ MinKey, MaxKey ] ],
     "ratings.by" : [ [ "anon", "anon" ] ]
   }

However, to compound the bounds for ``"ratings.score"`` with the bounds
for ``"ratings.by"``, the query must use :query:`$elemMatch`. See
:ref:`compound-fields-from-array` for more information.

.. _compound-fields-from-array:

Compound Bounds of Index Fields from an Array
``````````````````````````````````````````````

To compound together the bounds for index keys from the same array:

- the index keys must share the same field path up to, but not including, the
  field names, and

- the query must specify predicates on the fields using
  :query:`$elemMatch` on that path.

For a field in an embedded document, the :ref:`dotted field name
<document-dot-notation>`, such as ``"a.b.c.d"``, is the field path for
``d``. To compound the bounds for index keys from the same array, the
:query:`$elemMatch` must be on the path up to, *but not including*, the field
name itself; i.e. ``"a.b.c"``.

For instance, create a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` on
the ``ratings.score`` and the ``ratings.by`` fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey2.createIndex( { "ratings.score": 1, "ratings.by": 1 } )

The fields ``"ratings.score"`` and ``"ratings.by"`` share the field
path ``ratings``. The following query uses :query:`$elemMatch` on the
field ``ratings`` to set a requirement that the array contains at least one
*single* element that matches both conditions:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey2.find( { ratings: { $elemMatch: { score: { $lte: 5 }, by: "anon" } } } )

Taking the predicates separately:

- the bounds for the ``score: { $lte: 5 }`` predicate is ``[ -Infinity, 5
  ]``;

- the bounds for the ``by: "anon"`` predicate is ``[ "anon", "anon" ]``.

MongoDB can compound the two bounds to use the combined bounds of:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "ratings.score" : [ [ -Infinity, 5 ] ], "ratings.by" : [ [ "anon", "anon" ] ] }

Query Without ``$elemMatch``
````````````````````````````

If the query does *not* join the conditions on the indexed array fields
with :query:`$elemMatch`, MongoDB *cannot* compound their bounds.
Consider the following query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey2.find( { "ratings.score": { $lte: 5 }, "ratings.by": "anon" } )

Because a single embedded document in the array does not need to meet
both criteria, MongoDB does *not* compound the bounds. When using a
compound index, if MongoDB cannot constrain all the fields of the
index, MongoDB always constrains the leading field of the index, in
this case ``"ratings.score"``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "ratings.score": [ [ -Infinity, 5 ] ],
     "ratings.by": [ [ MinKey, MaxKey ] ]
   }

``$elemMatch`` on Incomplete Path
`````````````````````````````````

If the query does not specify :query:`$elemMatch` on the path of the
embedded fields, up to but excluding the field names, MongoDB
**cannot** compound the bounds of index keys from the same array.

For example, a collection ``survey3`` contains documents with a field
``item`` and an array field ``ratings``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: 1,
     item: "ABC",
     ratings: [ { score: { q1: 2, q2: 5 } }, { score: { q1: 8, q2: 4 } } ]
   }
   {
     _id: 2,
     item: "XYZ",
     ratings: [ { score: { q1: 7, q2: 8 } }, { score: { q1: 9, q2: 5 } } ]
   }

Create a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` on the
``ratings.score.q1`` and the ``ratings.score.q2`` fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey3.createIndex( { "ratings.score.q1": 1, "ratings.score.q2": 1 } )

The fields ``"ratings.score.q1"`` and ``"ratings.score.q2"`` share the
field path ``"ratings.score"``, and the :query:`$elemMatch` must be on
that path.

The following query, however, uses :query:`$elemMatch` but not on
the required path:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey3.find( { ratings: { $elemMatch: { 'score.q1': 2, 'score.q2': 8 } } } )

As such, MongoDB **cannot** compound the bounds, and the
``"ratings.score.q2"`` field will be unconstrained during the index
scan. To compound the bounds, the query must use :query:`$elemMatch` on
the path ``"ratings.score"``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey3.find( { 'ratings.score': { $elemMatch: { 'q1': 2, 'q2': 8 } } } )

Compound ``$elemMatch`` Clauses
```````````````````````````````

Consider a query that contains multiple :query:`$elemMatch` clauses on
different field paths, for instance, ``"a.b": { $elemMatch: ... },
"a.c": { $elemMatch: ... }``. MongoDB cannot combine the bounds of the
``"a.b"`` with the bounds of ``"a.c"`` since ``"a.b"`` and ``"a.c"``
also require :query:`$elemMatch` on the path ``a``.

For example, a collection ``survey4`` contains documents with a field
``item`` and an array field ``ratings``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     _id: 1,
     item: "ABC",
     ratings: [
       { score: { q1: 2, q2: 5 }, certainty: { q1: 2, q2: 3 } },
       { score: { q1: 8, q2: 4 }, certainty: { q1: 10, q2: 10 } }
     ]
   }
   {
     _id: 2,
     item: "XYZ",
     ratings: [
       { score: { q1: 7, q2: 8 }, certainty: { q1: 5, q2: 5 } },
       { score: { q1: 9, q2: 5 }, certainty: { q1: 7, q2: 7 } }
     ]
   }

Create a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` on the
``ratings.score.q1`` and the ``ratings.score.q2`` fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey4.createIndex( {
      "ratings.score.q1": 1,
      "ratings.score.q2": 1,
      "ratings.certainty.q1": 1,
      "ratings.certainty.q2": 1
   } )

Consider the following query with two :query:`$elemMatch` clauses:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.survey4.find(
     {
       "ratings.score": { $elemMatch: { q1: 5, q2: 5 } },
       "ratings.certainty": { $elemMatch: { q1: 7, q2: 7 } },
     }
   )

Taking the predicates separately:

- the bounds for the ``"ratings.score"`` predicate are the compound
  bounds:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { "ratings.score.q1" : [ [ 5, 5 ] ], "ratings.score.q2" : [ [ 5, 5 ] ] }

- the bounds for the ``"ratings.certainty"`` predicate are the compound
  bounds:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { "ratings.certainty.q1" : [ [ 7, 7 ] ], "ratings.certainty.q2" : [ [ 7, 7 ] ] }

However, MongoDB cannot compound the bounds for ``"ratings.score"`` and
``"ratings.certainty"``, since :query:`$elemMatch` does not join the
two. Instead, MongoDB constrains the leading field of the index
``"ratings.score.q1"``, which can be compounded with the bounds for
``"ratings.score.q2"``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "ratings.score.q1" : [ [ 5, 5 ] ],
     "ratings.score.q2" : [ [ 5, 5 ] ],
     "ratings.certainty.q1" : [ [ MinKey, MaxKey ] ],
     "ratings.certainty.q2" : [ [ MinKey, MaxKey ] ]
   }
