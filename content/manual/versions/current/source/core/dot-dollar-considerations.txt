MongoDB supports field names that are dollar (``$``) prefixed or that
contain periods (``.``).

In most cases data that has been stored using field names like these
is not directly accessible. You need to use helper methods like
:expression:`$getField`, :expression:`$setField`, and
:expression:`$literal` in queries that access those fields.

The field name validation rules are not the same for all types of
storage operations.
