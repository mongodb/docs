If your organization's owners enable
:atlas:`IP access list for the Atlas UI for an organization
</tutorial/manage-organizations/#require-ip-access-list-for-the-atlas-ui>`,
this restricts access to the |service| UI only to those users whose
IP addresses are included in the organization's IP access list. If you
don't have access to an organization, |charts| displays a banner at the
top of the page notifying you of the restriction. Contact your organization's
owners so that they can include your IP address in the access list for
the |service| UI for this organization. This restriction doesn't apply
to embedded charts applications and to the public dashboard.
