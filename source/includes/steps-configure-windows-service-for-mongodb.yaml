     .. important::

        Run all of the following commands in :guilabel:`Command Prompt` with
        "Administrative Privileges".
action:
  - pre: |
      Install the MongoDB service by starting :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe`
      with the ``--install`` option and the ``-config``
      option to specify the previously created configuration file.
    language: powershell
    code: |
      "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin\mongod.exe" --config "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\mongod.cfg" --install
post: |
  To use an alternate :setting:`dbpath`, specify the path in the
  configuration file (e.g. ``C:\mongodb\mongod.cfg``) or
  on the command line with the :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` option.

  If needed, you can install services for multiple instances of
  :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` or :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe`. Install each service
  with a unique :option:`--serviceName <mongod.exe --serviceName>` and
  :option:`--serviceDisplayName <mongod.exe --serviceDisplayName>`. Use
  multiple instances only when sufficient system resources exist and your
  system design requires it.

  Verify that MongoDB has started successfully by checking the 
  log file at ``c:\data\log\mongod.log`` for the following line:
post: |
  If you modified the :setting:`systemLog.path`
  configuration file option, open the log file at that location to 
  examine the process output.

  You may see non-critical warnings in the process
  output. As long as you see the log line shown above, you can safely
  ignore these warnings during your initial evaluation of MongoDB.

  To connect to MongoDB through the :binary:`~bin.mongo.exe <mongo>` shell,
  open another :guilabel:`Command Prompt`.
