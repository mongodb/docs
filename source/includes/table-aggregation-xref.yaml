v8: |
    Prior to 2.4, JavaScript code executed in a single thread.
grp1: |
   *Deprecated since version 3.4* Use :dbcommand:`aggregate` command
   or :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command instead.

grp2: |
      Can either group by existing fields or with a custom ``keyf``
      JavaScript function, can group by calculated fields.

      See :dbcommand:`group` for information and example using the
      ``keyf`` function.
grp3: |
      Custom ``reduce`` and ``finalize`` JavaScript functions offer
      flexibility to grouping logic.

      See :dbcommand:`group` for details and restrictions on these
      functions.

grp4: |
      Returns results inline as an array of grouped items.

      The result set must fit within the :ref:`maximum BSON document
      size limit <limit-bson-document-size>`.

      The returned array can contain at most 20,000 elements; i.e. at
      most 20,000 unique groupings.
grp5: |
      Does **not** support sharded collection.
grp7: |
      See :dbcommand:`group`.
mr1: |
     Implements the Map-Reduce aggregation for processing large data sets.
mr2: |
     In addition to grouping operations, can perform complex
     aggregation tasks as well as perform incremental aggregation on
     continuously growing datasets.

     See :doc:`/tutorial/map-reduce-examples/` and
     :doc:`/tutorial/perform-incremental-map-reduce/`.

mr3: |
     Custom ``map``, ``reduce`` and ``finalize`` JavaScript
     functions offer flexibility to aggregation logic.

     See :dbcommand:`mapReduce` for details and restrictions
     on the functions.
mr4: |
     Returns results in various options (inline, new collection, merge,
     replace, reduce). See :dbcommand:`mapReduce` for details on the
     output options.

mr5: Supports non-sharded and sharded input collections.
mr7: |
     See :doc:`/core/map-reduce` and :dbcommand:`mapReduce`.
agg1: |

      Designed with specific goals of improving performance and
      usability for aggregation tasks.

      Uses a "pipeline" approach where objects are transformed as they
      pass through a series of pipeline operators such as
      :pipeline:`$group`,  :pipeline:`$match`, and :pipeline:`$sort`.

      See :doc:`/reference/operator/aggregation` for more information
      on the pipeline operators.
agg2: |
      Pipeline operators can be repeated as needed.

      Pipeline operators need not produce one output document for every
      input document.

      Can also generate new documents or filter out documents.
agg3: |
      Limited to the operators and expressions supported by the
      aggregation pipeline.

      However, can add computed fields, create new virtual sub-objects,
      and extract sub-fields into the top-level of results by using the
      :pipeline:`$project` pipeline operator.

      See :pipeline:`$project` for more information as well as
      :doc:`/reference/operator/aggregation` for more information on all
      the available pipeline operators.
agg4: |
      Returns results as a cursor. If the pipeline includes the
      :pipeline:`$out` stage, the cursor is empty.

      .. versionchanged:: 3.4

         .. include:: /includes/deprecation-aggregate-wo-cursor.rst

agg5: Supports non-sharded and sharded input collections.
agg7: |
      See :doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline` and :dbcommand:`aggregate`.
