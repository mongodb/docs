preferred method of connection from the {+atlas-ui+}.

The connection string determines which data you can access and query. 
You can access and query data:

- :ref:`In your online archive only <connect-online-archive-atlas-ui>`.
- :ref:`In your online archive and Atlas cluster 
  <connect-online-archive-cluster-atlas-ui>`.
- :ref:`In your online archive through your federated database instance 
  <connect-online-archive-fdi>`.

.. note::

   |service| doesn't support :ref:`LDAP <ldap-connection-string>` for 
   your Online Archive connection.

Before you connect, you must configure the connection method for your 
online archive.
