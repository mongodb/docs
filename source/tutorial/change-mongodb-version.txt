You can upgrade or downgrade MongoDB versions within the same Feature
Compatibility Version (FCV) in |mms| :manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`,
:manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`, and :term:`standalone MongoDB instances <standalone>`
while maximizing the availability of your deployments.

You can :doc:`add custom-built versions of MongoDB </tutorial/configure-available-mongodb-version>`
for |mms| to download.

If |mms| doesn't manage your deployment, change the version of MongoDB manually.
To learn more, see upgrade tutorials for each :manual:`MongoDB release </release-notes>`.
