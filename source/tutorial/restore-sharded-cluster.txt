.. note::

   The following procedure applies to |version| sharded clusters. For
   earlier versions of MongoDB, refer to the corresponding version of
   the MongoDB Manual.

This procedure restores a sharded cluster from an existing backup,
such as :ref:`LVM snapshots <backup-sharded-lvm>` or 
:ref:`database dumps <backup-sharded-dumps>`. The source and
target sharded cluster must have the same number of shards. For complete
documentation on sharded cluster backups, see 
:ref:`backup-sharded-dumps` and :ref:`backup-sharded-lvm`.

.. admonition:: MongoDB Cloud Backups
   :class: note

   MongoDB Cloud Services provides built-in backup and
   restoration features for automatically restore sharded cluster 
   backups.

   For more information, see 
   `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?jmp=docs>`_,
   `MongoDB Cloud Manager <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/cloud-manager?jmp=docs>`_,
   and
   `MongoDB Ops Manager <https://www.mongodb.com/products/ops-manager?jmp=docs>`_.

A. (Optional) Review Replica Set Configurations
-----------------------------------------------

This procedure initiates a new replica set for the 
Config Server Replica Set (CSRS) and each shard replica set using
the default configuration. To use a different replica set
configuration for your restored CSRS and shards, you must
reconfigure the replica set(s).

If your source cluster is healthy and accessible, connect a 
:binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell to the primary replica set member
in each replica set and run :method:`rs.conf()` to view the
replica configuration document.

If you cannot access one or more components of the source sharded 
cluster, please reference any existing internal documentation to 
reconstruct the configuration requirements for each shard replica set 
and the config server replica set.

B. Prepare the Target Host for Restoration
------------------------------------------

Storage Space Requirements
  Ensure the target host hardware has sufficient open storage space
  for the restored data. If the target host contains existing sharded
  cluster data that you want to keep, ensure that you have enough 
  storage space for both the existing data and the restored data.

LVM Requirements
  For LVM snapshots, you must have at least one LVM managed
  volume group and an a logical volume with enough free space for the
  extracted snapshot data.

MongoDB Version Requirements
  Ensure the target host and source host have the MongoDB Server
  version. To check the version of MongoDB available on a host machine,
  run ``mongod --version`` from the terminal or shell.

  For complete documentation on installation, see
  :doc:`/installation`.

Shut Down Running MongoDB Processes
  If restoring to an existing cluster, shut down the 
  :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` or :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` 
  process on the target host.

  For hosts running :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`, connect a 
  :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell to the ``mongos`` and
  run :method:`db.shutdownServer()` from the ``admin`` database:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     use admin
     db.shutdownServer()

  For hosts running a :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>`, connect a 
  :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell to the ``mongod`` and
  run :method:`db.isMaster()`:

  * If :data:`~isMaster.ismaster` is false, the ``mongod`` is a
    :term:`secondary <Secondary>` member of a replica set. You 
    can shut it down by running :method:`db.shutdownServer()` from
    the ``admin`` database.

  * If :data:`~isMaster.ismaster` is true, the ``mongod`` is the
    :term:`primary <Primary>` member of a replica set. Shut down
    the secondary members of the replica set *first*. Use
    :method:`rs.status()` to identify the other members of
    the replica set.

    The primary automatically steps down after it detects a 
    majority of members are offline. After it steps down
    (:method:`db.isMaster` returns 
    :data:`ismaster: false <isMaster.ismaster>`), you can safely
    shut down the ``mongod``

Prepare Data Directory
  Create a directory on the target host for the restored database
  files. Ensure that the user that runs the 
  :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` has read, write, and execute permissions
  for all files and subfolders in that directory:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mkdir /path/to/mongodb
     chown -R mongodb:mongodb /path/to/mongodb
     chmod -R 770 /path/to/mongodb

  Substitute ``/path/to/mongodb`` with the path to the data directory
  you created.

Prepare Log Directory
  Create a directory on the target host for the 
  :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` log files. Ensure that the user that 
  runs the :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` has read, write, and execute 
  permissions for all files and subfolders in that directory:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mkdir /path/to/mongodb/logs
     chown -R mongodb:mongodb /path/to/mongodb/logs
     chmod -R 770 /path/to/mongodb/logs

  Substitute ``/path/to/mongodb/logs`` with the path to the log 
  directory you created.  

Create Configuration File
  This procedure assumes starting a :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>`
  with a :ref:`configuration file <configuration-file>`. 

  Create the configuration file in your preferred location. Ensure that
  the user that runs the :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` has read and
  write permissions on the configuration file:

  .. code-block:: sh

     touch /path/to/mongod.conf
     chown mongodb:mongodb /path/to/mongodb/mongod.conf
     chmod 644 /path/to/mongodb/mongod.conf

  Open the configuration file in your preferred text editor and
  modify at it as required by your deployment. Alternatively,
  if you have access to the original configuration file for the
  :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>`, copy it your preferred location
  on the target host.

  .. important::

     Validate that your configuration file includes the following
     settings:

     - :setting:`storage.dbPath` must be set to the path to your
       preferred data directory.

     - :setting:`systemLog.path` must be set to the path to your
       preferred log directory

     - :setting:`net.bindIp` must include the IP address of the
       host machine.

     - :setting:`replication.replSetName` has the same value across
       each member in any given replica set.

     - :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` has the same value across each
       member in any given replica set. 

C. Restore Config Server Replica Set
------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/restore-sharded-config-primary-from-backup.rst

D. Restore Each Shard Replica Set
---------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/restore-sharded-shard-primary-from-backup.rst

E. Restart Each :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`
---------------------------------------------

Restart each :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` in the cluster. 

.. code-block:: shell

   mongos --config /path/to/config/mongos.conf

Include all other command line options as required by your deployment.

If the CSRS replica set name or any member hostname changed, update the 
:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` configuration file setting 
:setting:`sharding.configDB` with updated configuration server 
connection string:

.. code-block:: yaml

   sharding:
     configDB: "myNewCSRSName/config1.example.net:27019,config2.example.net:27019,config3.example.net:27019"


F. Validate Cluster Accessibility
---------------------------------

Connect a :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell to one of the 
:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` processes for the cluster. Use
:method:`sh.status()` to check the overall cluster status. If 
:method:`sh.status()` indicates that the balancer is not running, use 
:method:`sh.startBalancer()` to restart the balancer.

To confirm that all shards are accessible and communicating, insert
test data into a temporary sharded collection. Confirm that data is
being split and migrated between each shard in your cluster. You can
connect a :binary:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell to each shard primary and
use :method:`db.collection.find()` to validate that the data was
sharded as expected.
