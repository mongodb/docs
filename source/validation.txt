Validation Tab
--------------

The :guilabel:`Validation` tab displays the :manual:`document
validation specification </core/document-validation>` (the validation
rules, the validation level, and the validation action) that exists for
a collection.

From this tab, you can update the document validation specification via
the Rule Builder or the JSON editor.

To access the :guilabel:`Validation` tab for a collection, click on the
collection on the left hand pane.

Rule Builder
------------

The Rule Builder facilitates the building and modification of document
validation rules; however, the Rule Builder only supports a subset of
validation conditions.

.. note::

   - If the current validation rules cannot be expressed through the
     Rule Builder, Compass deactivates the Rule Builder, and you can
     only modify the validation specification through the JSON editor
     view.

   - Each rule applies to a single field in the collection.

   - No two rules in the Rule Builder can have the same field.

   - The Rule Builder combines validation rules for the different
     fields as a logical ``AND``.

   - To specify conditions not supported by the Rule Builder or to join
     validation rules with a logical ``OR``, use the JSON editor
     instead.
