Overview
--------

|service-fullname| provides an easy way to host and manage your data in
the cloud. This tutorial guides you through creating an |service|
cluster and populating that cluster with data.

Create an |service| Account
---------------------------

*Estimated completion time: 5 minutes*

You will need to register an |service| account to log into
|service| and create your cluster.

.. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-atlas-account.rst

.. admonition:: |mms-full| Users
   :class: note

   If you are an existing |mms-full| user, you can use your |mms|
   credentials to log in to |service|_. You can then create a new
   |service| project from |mms|. 
   
   Once you have created your |service| project, you can move on to the
   next section.

Deploy a Free Tier Cluster
--------------------------

*Estimated completion time: 10 minutes*

|service| Free Tier clusters provide a small-scale development
environment to host your data. Free Tier clusters never expire, and
provide access to a :ref:`subset <atlas-free-tier>` of Atlas features
and functionality.

Paid clusters provide full access to |service| features, configuration
options, and operational capabilities. For more information on Paid
clusters, including deployment instructions, see
:doc:`/create-new-cluster`.

.. note::

   You can deploy only one Free Tier cluster per |service|
   project.

.. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-create-cluster.rst

Whitelist Your Connection IP Address
------------------------------------

*Estimated completion time: 2 minutes*

An :abbr:`IP address (Internet Protocal address)` is a unique numeric
identifier for a device connecting to a network. Within |service|, you
can create a list of trusted IP addresses that can connect to your
cluster and access your data. |service| only allows connections to a
cluster from addresses listed in the IP whitelist.

To add your IP address to the whitelist:

.. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-whitelist.rst

.. seealso::

   For information on configuring additional whitelist entries in
   your project, see :doc:`/security-whitelist/`.

Create a MongoDB User for Your Cluster
--------------------------------------

*Estimated completion time: 2 minutes*

You must create a MongoDB user to access your deployment. For security
purposes, |service| requires clients to authenticate as MongoDB users
to access clusters.

MongoDB users are separate from |service| users:

- MongoDB users can access databases hosted in |service|.

- |service| users can log into |service| but do not have access to
  MongoDB databases.

To add a MongoDB user to your cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-add-mongodb-users.rst

.. seealso::

   For information on configuring additional MongoDB users on your
   cluster, see :doc:`/security-add-mongodb-users/`.

Insert Data into Your Cluster
-----------------------------

*Estimated completion time: 5 minutes* 

The following steps in this tutorial show you how to insert and
interact with data on your cluster. Select the appropriate tab based
on how you would like to interact with your cluster data:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: atlas-gui
       name: Atlas GUI
       content: |   

         |service| provides a :abbr:`GUI (Graphical user interface)`
         to add and interact with data in your cluster, called the
         :guilabel:`Data Explorer`.

         To insert data into your cluster using the
         :guilabel:`Data Explorer`:
         
         .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-explorer-insert.rst

         .. seealso::

            For more information on Data Explorer in |service|, see
            :doc:`/data-explorer`.

View and Edit Your Cluster Data
-------------------------------

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: atlas-gui
       name: Atlas GUI
       content: |

         *Estimated completion time: 2 minutes*

         Now that you have inserted a document into your cluster, you
         can try modifying it.

         .. include:: /includes/steps/getting-started-explorer-edit.rst

Summary
-------

.. tabs::

   hidden: true

   tabs:
     - id: atlas-gui
       name: Atlas GUI
       content: |

         You have just set up an |service| cluster to host your data,
         populated that cluster with data, and learned how to interact
         with that data using the |service| Data Explorer.

         Moving Forward
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         If you continue to grow your cluster, consider
         :doc:`scaling your cluster </scale-cluster/>` to support more
         users and operations.
