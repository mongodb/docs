msgid "Members of a :term:`replica set` replicate data continuously. First, a member uses *initial sync* to capture the data set. Then the member continuously records and applies every operation that modifies the data set. Every member records operations in its :doc:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog>`, which is a :term:`capped collection`."
