Definition
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``$meta`` expression returns an object containing all streaming
metadata for a document. You can expose this data for either the
entire stream, or one of the following {+atlas-sp+} aggregation
stages:

- :pipeline:`$source`
- :pipeline:`$hoppingWindow`
- :pipeline:`$tumblingWindow`
- :pipeline:`$https`

A ``$meta`` expression has the following prototype form:

.. code-block:: json

   { "$meta": <string> }

.. code-block:: json

  { 
    source: {
      type: string,
      ts: date,
      source.topic: string
      source.partition: int
      source.offset: int
      source.key: string|int|long|double|object|binData
      source.headers: array[obj]
    },
    window: { 
      start: date,
      end: date
    },
    https: { 
      url: string
      method: string
      httpStatusCode: int
      responseTimeMs: int  
    }
  }


.. _atlas-sp-agg-meta-syntax:

Syntax
~~~~~~

The ``$meta`` expression takes a single string input corresponding to
the fully qualified, dot-syntax path of a source of metadata. The root
of this path must be ``"stream"``. You can query the following paths:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 25 50

   * - Path
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``stream``
     - object
     - All metadata for the :pipeline:`$source` stage and any window
       stage or :pipeline:`$https` stage configured in the pipeline.

   * - ``stream.source``
     - object
     - All metadata for the :pipeline:`$source` stage.

   * - ``stream.source.type``
     - string
     - Type of connection used as a source.

   * - ``stream.source.ts``
     - ISODate
     - Date and time of the record at the point of ingestion.

   * - ``stream.source.topic``
     - string
     - Kafka topic from which the stream ingests records. Available
       only from a Kafka source.

   * - ``stream.source.partition``
     - integer
     - Partition of the Kafka topic from which the stream ingests
       records. Available only from a Kafka source.

   * - ``stream.source.offset``
     - integer
     - Offset tracking message order and queue position within a
       Kafka source partition. Available only from a Kafka source.

   * - ``stream.source.key``
     - string|int|long|double|object|binData
     - Key assigned to Kafka messages for partitioning and load
       distribution. Available only from a Kafka source.

   * - ``stream.source.headers``
     - array
     - Set of key-value pairs describing Kafka message metadata.

   * - ``stream.window``
     - object
     - All metadata for the :pipeline:`$hoppingWindow` or
       :pipeline:`$tumblingWindow` stage. This object is set
       only when a document enters a :pipeline:`$hoppingWindow` or
       :pipeline:`$tumblingWindow` stage.

   * - ``stream.window.start``
     - ISODate
     - Start time of the current window.

   * - ``stream.window.end``
     - ISODate
     - End time of the current window.

   * - ``stream.https``
     - object
     - All metadata for the :pipeline:`$https` stage.
       This object is set only when  an :pipeline:`$https` 
       stage outputs a document.

   * - ``stream.https.url``
     - string
     - URL from which the :pipeline:`$https` stage sources data.

   * - ``stream.https.method``
     - string
     - HTTPS request method sent to the URL.

   * - ``stream.https.httpStatusCode``
     - int
     - HTTP response code for the request sent to the URL.

   * - ``stream.https.responseTimeMs``
     - int
     - Time, in milliseconds, it took to receive the response
       from the URL.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

The {+atlas-sp+} ``$meta`` expression provides all of the
functionality of the existing MongoDB :expression:`$meta` aggregation
expression. However, you can't use the functionality specific to the
{+atlas-sp+} version of ``$meta`` in a standard MongoDB aggregation
query.

Examples
---------

The following example enriches the output of a stream with an array of
the Kafka source topics from which the data was ingested:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     $source: {
       connectionName: “kafka”,
       topic: [“t1”, “t2”, “t3”]
     }
   },
   {
     $emit: {
       connectionName: “kafka”,
       topic: {
         $concat: [
	   {
             $meta: “stream.source.topic”
	   },
	   “out"
	 ]
       }
     }
   }

The following example adds a field to the stream reporting the start
time of each window.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     $source: {
       connectionName: "kafka",
       topic: "t1"
     }
   },
   {
     $hoppingWindow: . . .
   },
   {
     $addFields: {
       start: { $meta: "stream.window.start" }
     }
   }
