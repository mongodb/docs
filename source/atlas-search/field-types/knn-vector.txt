.. |sample-collection| replace:: :ref:`sample_mflix.embedded_movies <mflix-embedded_movies>`

You can use the ``knnVector`` type to index vector embeddings. The
vector field can be represented as an array of :ref:`numbers 
<bson-data-types-number>` of the following types:

- |bson| ``int32``, ``int64``, or ``double`` data types for querying
  using the :ref:`knn-beta-ref` operator.
- |bson| ``double`` data type for querying using the
  :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage. 
  
You can use the :ref:`knn-beta-ref` operator, which is now deprecated,
and the :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` stage in your aggregation
pipeline to query fields indexed as ``knnVector``. 

.. note:: 

   You can't use the |fts| :guilabel:`Visual Editor` in the {+atlas-ui+} to
   configure fields of type ``knnVector``. Instead, use the |fts|
   :guilabel:`JSON Editor` to configure fields of type ``knnVector``.
   
You can also use {+avs+} with local |service| deployments that you 
create with the {+atlas-cli+}. To learn more, see 
:atlascli:`Create a Local Atlas Deployment </atlas-cli-deploy-local>`.

Review |fts-field-type| Type Limitations 
----------------------------------------

You can't index fields inside arrays of documents or fields inside 
arrays of objects (|fts| :ref:`embeddedDocuments
<bson-data-types-embedded-documents>` type) as ``knnVector`` type.

Configure |fts-field-type| Field Properties  
-------------------------------------------

The ``knnVector`` type has the following options:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 10 15 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Type 
     - Necessity
     - Purpose

   * - ``type``
     - string
     - Required
     - Human-readable label that identifies this field type. Value must 
       be ``knnVector``.

   * - ``dimensions``
     - int
     - Required
     - Number of vector dimensions, which |fts| enforces at index- and 
       query-time. This value can't be greater than ``4096``.

   * - ``similarity``
     - string
     - Required
     - Vector similarity function to use to search for top K-nearest 
       neighbors. Value can be one of the following:

       - ``euclidean`` - measures the distance between ends of vectors. 
         This allows you to measure similarity based on varying 
         dimensions. To learn more, see :wikipedia:`Euclidean 
         <Euclidean_distance>`.
       - ``cosine`` - measures similarity based on the angle between 
         vectors. This allows you to measure similarity that isn't 
         scaled by magnitude. You can't use zero magnitude vectors with 
         ``cosine``. To measure cosine similarity, we recommend that 
         you normalize your vectors and use ``dotProduct`` instead. To 
         learn more, see :wikipedia:`Cosine <Cosine_similarity>`.
       - ``dotProduct`` - measures similarity like ``cosine``, but takes 
         into account the magnitude of the vector. This allows you to 
         efficiently measure similarity based on both angle and 
         magnitude. To learn more, 
         see :wikipedia:`Dot Product <Dot_product>`.
         
         If you normalize the magnitude, ``cosine`` and 
         ``dotProduct`` are almost identical in measuring similarity.

Try an Example for the |fts-field-type| Type  
--------------------------------------------

The following index definition for the ``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` 
collection dynamically indexes all the dynamically indexable fields 
in the collection and statically indexes ``plot_embedding`` field as 
the ``knnVector`` type. The ``plot_embedding`` field contains embeddings
created using OpenAI's ``text-embedding-ada-002`` embeddings model. The
index definition specifies ``1536`` vector dimensions and measures
similarity using ``euclidean``. 

.. code-block:: json 
   :linenos:

   {
     "mappings": {
       "dynamic": true,
       "fields": {
         "plot_embedding": {
           "type": "knnVector",
           "dimensions": 1536,
           "similarity": "euclidean"
         }
       }
     }
   }

If you load the :ref:`sample data <mflix-embedded_movies>` on your 
cluster and create the preceding |fts| index for this collection, 
you can run :pipeline:`$vectorSearch` queries against this collection.
To learn more about the sample queries that you can run, see 
:ref:`$vectorSearch Examples <vectorSearch-agg-pipeline-egs>`.
