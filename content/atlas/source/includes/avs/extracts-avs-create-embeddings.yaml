  In this section, you use an embedding model to generate vector embeddings. 
  This example also includes an optional function that
  you can use to compress your embeddings for efficient storage 
  and improved query performance. To learn more, 
  see :ref:`avs-vector-compression`.

ref: avs-bson-function-python-description

  Optionally, you can compress your embeddings by converting them 
  to |bson| binary format, also called ``binData`` vectors, 
  for efficient storage and retrieval. 
  To learn more, see :ref:`avs-vector-compression`. 

  This code does the following: 

  - Defines a function named ``generate_bson_vector`` to convert
    embeddings to ``binData`` vectors by using binary tools from the 
    :driver:`PyMongo driver </pymongo/>`.
  - Converts the embeddings you generated for the 
    string ``foo`` to ``binData`` vectors.
    The exact embedding varies depending on the model you use.

  a. Create a file named ``convert-embeddings.js``. 

     .. code-block:: shell

        touch convert-embeddings.js

  #. Paste the following code in the file. 

     This code defines a function named ``convertEmbeddingsToBSON`` to convert
     ``float32`` embeddings to ``binData`` vectors by using binary tools from the 
     :driver:`Node.js driver </node/>`.

     .. include:: /includes/avs/create-embeddings/manual/fact-bin-data-embedding-format-warning.rst

     .. literalinclude:: /includes/avs/create-embeddings/manual/convert-embeddings.js
        :language: js

  Paste and run the following code in your notebook to create
  a function named ``get_embedding()`` that generates vector embeddings by 
  using an embedding model from `Voyage AI <https://www.voyageai.com>`__. 
  Replace ``<api-key>`` with your `Voyage API key 
  <https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/api-key-and-installation>`__.
  
  The function specifies the following:

  - ``voyage-3-large`` as the embedding model to use.
  - ``input_type`` parameter to optimize your embeddings for retrieval. 
    To learn more, see :ref:`Voyage AI Python Client <voyage-python-client>`.

  .. tip::

     For all models and parameters, see :ref:`Voyage AI Text Embeddings
     <voyage-text-embeddings>`.
