You can monitor a migration job from the :guilabel:`History` pane on the 
:guilabel:`Data Migration` tab. The :guilabel:`History` pane contains 
information about in progress, completed, and failed migration jobs.

About this Task
---------------

Migration jobs execute in a number of distinct stages, which are visible on 
the :guilabel:`Job overview` pane. 

For example:

- A snapshot migration job includes a snapshot stage and, optionally, a verification stage.
- A continuous migration job includes a snapshot stage, followed by a CDC stage. 

Job Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~

High-level migration job information displays in the top section of the :guilabel:`Job overview` pane.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - Source URI  
     - The JDBC connection string used to connect to the source relational database.

   * - Destination URI   
     - The MongoDB connection string used to connect to the destination MongoDB database.

   * - Job Mode   
     - Indicates if the migration job is snapshot or continuous. 

   * - Status   
     -  Indicates the current or end status of the migration job.   

Snapshot Stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Snapshot stage information displays in the :guilabel:`Snapshot stage` section of the :guilabel:`Job overview` pane.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - Snapshot stage status 
     - Indicates the status of the snapshot stage. 

   * - Started
     - Date and time that the snapshot stage started. 

   * - Duration
     - Time taken for the snapshot stage to complete. 

   * - Tables migrated 
     - Total number of tables migrated from the source database. 

   * - Rows migrated 
     - Total number of rows migrated from all tables.

   * - Estimated time remaining
     - An estimation of the migration job completion time.

CDC Stage
~~~~~~~~~

The CDC stage information is displayed in the :guilabel:`CDC stage` section 
of the :guilabel:`Job overview` pane. The CDC stage begins after the initial 
snapshot stage has completed and remains in the :guilabel:`RUNNING` status 
until it is explicitly completed, or the migration job encounters an unrecoverable error.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - CDC stage status 
     - Indicates the status of the CDC stage. When a CDC stage is actively replicating 
       data changes, this status is :guilabel:`RUNNING`.

   * - Started 
     - Date and time that Relational Migrator started listening for data change events.

   * - Last event time 
     - Latest date and time that Relational Migrator detected a data change event.

   * - Total events seen 
     - Number of data change events Relational Migrator has detected since the CDC stage started.

   * - Events in the last hour 
     - Number of data change events Relational Migrator has detected in the last hour.

Issues
~~~~~~

If your migration job has errors during execution, you can find the details 
in the :guilabel:`Issues` pane on the :guilabel:`Data Migration` screen.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - Date & Time 
     - The date and time that the issue occurred.

   * - Table / Collection
     - The table or collection that caused the error. This is blank if the error is global.

   * - Count 
     - Total number of errors encountered.

   * - Error detail 
     - Detailed error message from the target deployment.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::

  .. step:: Select a migration job
    
    Click on a previous migration job in the :guilabel:`History` pane to 
    load the :guilabel:`Overview` and :guilabel:`Issue` information.

    :guilabel:`Snapshot stage` and :guilabel:`CDC stage` logging 
    information display next to each respective section of the 
    :guilabel:`Job overview` pane.

  .. step:: View logging information

     a. Click the :guilabel:`>` icon under the :guilabel:`Issues` section

     Kafka configuration or connections errors are visible at the 
     migration job level:
