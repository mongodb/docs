You can update a document's shard key value unless the shard key field is the 
immutable ``_id`` field.

.. important:: When updating the shard key value

   - You **must** be on a :binary:`~bin.mongos`. Do **not** issue the
     operation directly on the shard.

   - You **must** run either in a :doc:`transaction
     </core/transactions>` or as a :doc:`retryable write
     </core/retryable-writes>`.

   - You **must** include an equality condition on the full shard
     key in the query filter. For example, consider a ``messages``
     collection that uses ``{ activityid: 1, userid : 1 }`` as the
     shard key. To update the shard key value for a document, you must
     include ``activityid: <value>, userid: <value>`` in the query
     filter. You can include additional fields in the query as
     appropriate.

   See also the specific write command/methods for additional
   operation-specific requirements when run against a sharded
   collection.

To update a shard key value, use the following operations:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Command
     - Method

   * - :ref:`update <command-update-shard-key-modification>` with ``multi: false``
     - | :ref:`db.collection.replaceOne() <replaceOne-shard-key-modification>`
       | :ref:`db.collection.updateOne() <updateOne-shard-key-modification>`

       To set to a non-``null`` value, the update :red:`must` be
       performed either inside a transaction or as a retryable write.

   * - :ref:`findAndModify <cmd-findAndModify-sharded-collection>`
     - | :ref:`db.collection.findOneAndReplace() <findOneAndReplace-shard-key-modification>`
       | :ref:`db.collection.findOneAndUpdate() <findOneAndUpdate-shard-key-modification>`
       | :ref:`db.collection.findAndModify() <method-findAndModify-sharded-collection>`

       To set to a non-``null`` value, the update :red:`must` be
       performed either inside a transaction or as a retryable write.

   * -
     - | :method:`db.collection.bulkWrite()`
       | :method:`Bulk.find.updateOne()`

       If the shard key modification results in moving the document to
       another shard, you cannot specify more than one shard key
       modification in the bulk operation; the batch size has to be 1.

       If the shard key modification does not result in moving the
       document to another shard, you can specify multiple shard
       key modification in the bulk operation.

       To set to a non-``null`` value, the operation :red:`must` be
       performed either inside a transaction or as a retryable write.

Example
-------

Consider a ``sales`` collection which is sharded on the ``location``
field. The collection contains a document with the ``_id``
``12345`` and the ``location`` ``""``. To update the field value for
this document, you can run the following command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.sales.updateOne(
     { _id: 12345, location: "" },
     { $set: { location: "New York"} }
   )
