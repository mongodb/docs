Overview
--------

|mms-full| is a service for managing, monitoring and backing up a MongoDB
infrastructure.  In addition, |mms| allows Administrators to
maintain a server pool to facilitate the deployment of MongoDB.

|mms| provides the services described here.

.. _monitoring-functional-overview:

Monitoring
----------

|mms| Monitoring provides real-time reporting, visualization, and alerting
on key database and hardware indicators.

**How it Works:** A lightweight Monitoring Agent runs within your infrastructure and
collects statistics from the nodes in your MongoDB deployment. The agent
transmits database statistics back to |mms| to provide real-time
reporting. You can set alerts on indicators you choose.

.. _automation:

Automation
----------

.. only:: onprem

   |mms| Automation provides an interface for configuring MongoDB nodes
   and clusters and for upgrading your MongoDB deployment.

.. only:: cloud

   |mms| Automation provides an interface for provisioning machines,
   configuring MongoDB nodes and clusters, and upgrading your MongoDB
   deployment.

**How it Works:** Automation Agents on each server maintain your deployments. The
Automation Agent also maintains the Monitoring and Backup agents and
starts, restarts, and upgrades the agents as needed.

Automation allows only one agent of each type per machine and will remove
additional agents. For example, when maintaining Backup Agents, automation
will remove a Backup Agent from a machine that has two Backup Agents.

.. _mms-backup-functional-overview:

Backup
------

|mms| Backup provides scheduled snapshots and point-in-time recovery of
your MongoDB :term:`replica sets <replica set>` and :term:`sharded
clusters <sharded cluster>`.

**How it Works:** A lightweight Backup Agent runs within your
infrastructure and backs up data from the MongoDB processes you have
specified.

.. _data-backup:

Data Backup
~~~~~~~~~~~

When you start Backup for a MongoDB deployment, the agent performs an
:term:`initial sync` of the deployment's data as if it were creating a
new, "invisible" member of a replica set. For a sharded cluster the agent
performs a sync of each shard's :term:`primary` and of each config server.
The agent ships initial sync and oplog data over HTTPS back to |mms|.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/functional-overview-data-backup.rst

Backup performs the initial sync and the tailing of the oplog using
standard MongoDB queries. The production replica set is not aware of the
copy of the backup data.

Backup uses a :program:`mongod` with a version equal to or greater than
the version of the replica set it backs up.

Backup takes and stores snapshots based on a user-defined :ref:`snapshot
retention policy <snapshot-frequency-and-retention>`.
Sharded clusters snapshots temporarily stop the
balancer via the :program:`mongos` so that they can insert a marker
token into all shards and config servers in the cluster. |mms| takes a
snapshot when the marker tokens appear in the backup data.

The procedures used to reduce the storage space required to store a snapshot
depend on where it is stored, as described in the following table:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75
   
   * - Snapshot Store
     - Description
   
   * - MongoDB blockstore
     - Each successive snapshot stores only the differences from the
       previous snapshot. Compression and block-level de-duplication
       reduce the size of snapshot data. 

   * - AWS S3 bucket
     - Each successive snapshot stores only the differences from the
       previous snapshot. Compression and block-level de-duplication
       reduce the size of snapshot data.

   * - File system store
     - Depending on the configuration, compression reduces the size of
       the snapshot data.

All snapshots represent a full backup. See :doc:`Backup Configuration Options </core/backup-preparations>`
for more information about backup configurations.

.. _restores:

Data Restoration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| Backup lets you restore data from a scheduled snapshot or from a
selected point between snapshots. For sharded clusters you can restore
from :ref:`checkpoints <checkpoint>` between snapshots. For replica sets,
you can restore from selected points in time.

When you restore from a snapshot, |mms| reads directly from the snapshot
storage and transfers files either through an HTTPS download link
or by sending them via HTTPS or SCP.

When you restore from a checkpoint or point in time, |mms| first creates a
local restore of a snapshot from the snapshot storage and then applies stored
oplogs until the specified point is reached. |mms| delivers the backup via
the same HTTPS or SCP mechanisms. To enable checkpoints, see
:ref:`enable-cluster-checkpoints`.

.. only:: onprem

   The amount of oplog to keep per backup is configurable and affects the
   time window available for checkpoint and point-in-time restores.
