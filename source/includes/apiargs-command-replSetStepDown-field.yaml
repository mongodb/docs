  The number of seconds to step down the primary, during which time the
  stepdown member is ineligible for becoming primary. If you specify a
  non-numeric value, the command uses ``60`` seconds.

  The stepdown period starts from the time that the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` receives the command. The stepdown period must
  be greater than the ``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs``.

  The number of seconds that the :binary:`~bin.mongod` will wait for
  an electable secondary to catch up to the primary.

  When specified, ``secondaryCatchUpPeriodSecs`` overrides the default
  wait time of either ``10`` seconds or if ``force: true``, ``0``
  seconds.

arg_name: field

  A boolean that determines whether the primary steps down if no electable
  and up-to-date secondary exists within the wait period.

  If ``true``, the primary steps down even if no suitable secondary
  member exists; this could lead to :doc:`rollbacks
  </core/replica-set-rollbacks>` if a secondary with replication lag
  becomes the new primary.

  If ``false``, the primary does not step down if no suitable secondary
  member exists and the command returns an error.

  Defaults to ``false``.
