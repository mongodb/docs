Sync jobs are the worker processes responsible for transferring your 
data and schemas from a relational database to MongoDB. Create a new 
sync job from the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab.

.. include:: /includes/fact-kafka-supported-task.rst

About this Task
---------------

- The URI credentials you provide when creating a sync job do not 
  need to be the same as the credentials used when creating your project.

.. include:: /includes/fact-kafka-additional-time.rst

- .. include:: /includes/fact-cdc-recoverable.rst

Before you Begin
----------------

- :ref:`Create one or more mapping rules <create-rule-relational>` in your 
  Relational Migrator project.
- Prepare a :ref:`MongoDB URI <rm-mongodb-database-connection-strings>` and
  credentials that have read/write permissions on your destination database.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::

  .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Create Sync Job` button

    On the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab, click :guilabel:`Create Sync Job`. 
    Relational Migrator only runs one sync job at a time. If a sync job is in 
    progress, this button is disabled.

  .. step:: Enter the relational database connection details

      On the :guilabel:`Connect Source DB` form, enter the connection details 
      to create the JDBC URI for your relational database. 

      2a. Select a database type from the :guilabel:`Database type` drop-down.

      2b. Enter a host IP or DNS name in the :guilabel:`Host` text box. 

      2c. Enter a port number in the :guilabel:`Port` text box. 

      2d. Enter a database name in the :guilabel:`Database` text field.

      Depending on your relational database, this behavior varies:

      .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Database Type
          - Behavior
        * - Oracle 
          - You must enter a database name and a :guilabel:`Service ID` or :guilabel:`SID`.
        * - SQL Server
          - Enter a database name, or leave blank to load all databases.
        * - MySQL 
          - Enter a database name, or leave blank to load all databases.
        * - Postgres 
          - Leaving database name blank loads schemas from the default database.
        * - Sybase ASE
          - Leaving database name blank loads schemas from the default database.
  
      2e. Enter a username in the :guilabel:`Username` text box. 

      2f. Enter a password in the :guilabel:`Password` text box. 

      2g. (Optional) Click the :guilabel:`Save a password for this session` checkbox.

      2h. Click the :guilabel:`SSL` toggle switch to enable or disable SSL and select an SSL mode.

      2i. Click :guilabel:`Connect`

      .. note::

        Connection and SSL details depend on the database type you are connecting to. 
        In addition to the generic connection properties listed above, you may also need
        to select an :guilabel:`Identifier` for Oracle and :guilabel:`Authentication`
        for SQL Server.

        If you want to specify the JDBC URI manually, click the 
        :guilabel:`Enter URI manually` toggle switch on the 
        :guilabel:`Connect SourceDB` form. For details, see 
        :ref:`rm-relational-database-connection-strings`.

  .. step:: Enter the source MongoDB connection details 

      To provide the MongoDB connection details, select an Atlas
      cluster or provide a MongoDB connection string (URI). If you're :ref:`logged 
      in with Atlas <rm-atlas-log-in>`, the default option is to :guilabel:`Select 
      a cluster`. If you aren't logged in with Atlas, the :guilabel:`Select a cluster` 
      option is disabled.

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Select a cluster
            :tabid: select-atlas-cluster

            On the :guilabel:`Connect Destination DB` form, select an :guilabel:`Atlas Cluster` 
            from the drop-down. Clusters are displayed in a three-level hierarchy: 
            :guilabel:`Organization` > :guilabel:`Project` > :guilabel:`Cluster`, 
            organized alphabetically. Only the first 100 clusters you are authorized to 
            access are shown.

            If you leave any of the form fields for :guilabel:`Database`, :guilabel:`Username`, 
            or :guilabel:`Password` blank, the values from the Atlas cluster's metadata 
            are used.

            Click :guilabel:`Connect`.

         .. tab:: Enter MongoDB URI
            :tabid: enter-mongodb-uri


            On the :guilabel:`Connect Destination DB` form, input your 
            :guilabel:`MongoDB connection string (URI)`.

            If you leave any of the form fields for :guilabel:`Database`, :guilabel:`Username`, 
            or :guilabel:`Password` blank, the values specified in the URI are used.

            Click :guilabel:`Connect`.

  .. step:: Select your migration options
   
      On the :guilabel:`Migration Options` form, select your 
      :guilabel:`Migration Options`:

      .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Migration Option
          - Description
        * - Mode 
          - Defines the type of sync job.
        * - Drop destination collections before migration
          - Boolean. Indicates whether Relational Migrator drops a 
            destination collection before transferring data. 
        * - Stop after errors 
          - Integer. Indicates the number of errors after which Relational 
            Migrator stops the sync job.  
        * - Verify migrated data 
          - Boolean. If true, the sync engine checks the migrated data 
            against the source database. Only supported for snapshot mode.

      After you specify the job type on :guilabel:`Migration Options` 
      form, Relational Migrator conducts various checks to ensure that 
      the database is configured correctly. If a configuration is 
      missing, a banner displays indicating improper 
      database setup and provides a :guilabel:`Generate Script` button 
      for SQL script download.

      This script includes the required configuration statements 
      and additional instructions in the form of comments. 

      .. warning:: 

        Before proceeding with starting a sync job:

        1. Download the script. 
        2. Carefully review its contents.
        3. Execute the statements.
        4. Follow any commented manual steps.

  .. step:: Review and start your sync job

      On the :guilabel:`Review Summary` form, you can see details about 
      your sync job. These details include the type, the number of 
      tables and rows affected, and the estimated data size of the 
      sync job. To start your sync job, click :guilabel:`Start`. 

      .. note :: 
         
         For Kafka sync jobs, view deployment details by selecting the 
         job in the :guilabel:`History` pane on the 
         :guilabel:`Data Migration` screen and hovering
         over the icon next to the :guilabel:`Create Migration Job`
         button.
