Activate |backup| for a Sharded Cluster
=======================================

.. start-content

.. note::
   The sharded-cluster must be MongoDB version 2.4.3 or later.

To backup a cluster,

#. Go to :guilabel:`MMS Backup`.

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Sharded Cluster Status` tab to see the list of your
   clusters and their backup details.

#. For the sharded cluster you want to enable, select
   :guilabel:`Start` in the :guilabel:`Action` column.

#. Specify which instances to use for the initial sync. To
   minimize the impact on the primaries, sync off of the secondaries.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-excluded-namespace.rst

Your Backup agent will start polling the specified
instance for this sharded cluster.
