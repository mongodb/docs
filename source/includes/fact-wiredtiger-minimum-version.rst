You must be using MongoDB version 3.0 or greater in order to use the
WiredTiger storage engine. If upgrading from an earlier version of
MongoDB, see the guides on :doc:`Upgrading to MongoDB 3.0
</release-notes/3.0-upgrade>` or :doc:`Upgrading to MongoDB 3.2
</release-notes/3.2-upgrade>` before proceeding with changing your
storage engine.
