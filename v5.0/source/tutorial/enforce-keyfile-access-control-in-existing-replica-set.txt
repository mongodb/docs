Overview
--------

Enforcing access control on an existing :term:`replica set` requires
configuring:

- Security between members of the replica set using
  :doc:`Internal Authentication</core/security-internal-authentication>`, and

- Security between connecting clients and the replica set using
  :doc:`User Access Controls</core/authorization>`.

For this tutorial, each member of the replica set uses the same internal
authentication mechanism and settings.

Enforcing internal authentication also enforces user access control. To
connect to the replica set, clients like :binary:`~bin.mongosh` need to
use a :doc:`user account</core/authorization>`. See
:ref:`security-replSet-auth-access-control`.

Cloud Manager and Ops Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If Cloud Manager or Ops Manager is managing your deployment, see the
:mms-docs:`Cloud Manager manual
</tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials>` or the :opsmgr:`Ops
Manager manual </tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials>` for
enforcing access control.

Operating System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial uses the :binary:`~bin.mongod` programs. Windows users should
use the :binary:`mongod.exe` program instead.

Keyfile Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keyfiles are bare-minimum forms of security and are best suited for testing or
development environments. For production environments we recommend using
:doc:`x.509 certificates</core/security-x.509>`.

Downtime
~~~~~~~~

The following procedure for enforcing access control requires downtime.
For a procedure that does not require downtime, see
:doc:`/tutorial/enforce-keyfile-access-control-in-existing-replica-set-without-downtime`
instead.

x.509 Internal Authentication
-----------------------------

For details on using x.509 for internal authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-member-authentication`.

To upgrade from keyfile internal authentication to x.509 internal
authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-keyfile-to-x509`.
