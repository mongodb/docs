.. default-domain:: mongodb

Data in MongoDB has a *flexible schema*. :term:`Collections
<collection>` do not enforce :term:`document` structure. This
flexibility gives you data-modeling choices to match your application
and its performance requirements.

Read the :doc:`/core/data-modeling-introduction` document for a high
level introduction to data modeling, and proceed to the documents in
the :doc:`/core/data-models` section for additional documentation of
the data model design process. The :ref:`data-modeling-patterns`
documents provide examples of different data models. In addition, the
:ecosystem:`MongoDB Use Case Studies </use-cases>` provide overviews of
application design and include example data models with MongoDB.
