Limit the Rows a Data Table Displays
====================================

Users with the ``Author`` :ref:`dashboard role <dashboard-roles>` can 
limit the number of rows that a data table displays, thereby limiting 
the data accessible to viewers.

Behavior
--------

Limiting is off by default.

When a row limit is applied to a data table in the 
:doc:`Chart Builder </build-charts>`, it is applied to the chart 
definition. The visible subset of data becomes the entire data set 
available to viewers.

Dashboard viewers can temporarily change the 
:ref:`sort order <charts-sort-data>`, but only the 
data that initially appears on the chart is re-sorted.

.. example::

   A movie data source provides a ranked list of 100 movies. A chart 
   ``Author`` chooses to limit the results to 10 and sort in descending 
   rank order to show the top 10 movies.
   
   A ``Viewer`` then sorts the chart into ascending order. The same 10 
   movies are displayed in ascending order. The user does not have
   access to the 90 movies that the chart ``Author`` excluded.

Procedure
---------

To limit the number of rows that a chart displays:

1. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Encode` tab of the 
   :doc:`Chart Builder </build-charts>` and toggle 
   :guilabel:`Limit Results` to enable it.

#. Specify the number of rows to show between ``1`` and ``9999``.Â 
   The default is ``10``.

Considerations
--------------

The data displayed on a table with a row limit is specific to the 
:ref:`sort order <charts-sort-data>` you define in the 
:doc:`Chart Builder </build-charts>`. If you change your sorting, you 
change the data presented in your table.
