==============================================
Remove a Process from Management or Monitoring
==============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can remove a processes from management, monitoring, or both. Removing
a process from management means you can no longer control it directly
through |mms|. Removing it from monitoring means |mms| no longer displays
its status or tracks its metrics. You can remove individual processes or
an entire :term:`cluster <sharded cluster>` or :term:`replica set`.

As an alternative to removing a process from monitoring, you can instead
disable its alerts, which allows you to continue to view the process in
the :guilabel:`Deployment` page but turns off notifications about its
status. To use this option, see :doc:`/tutorial/manage-host-alerts`.

Prerequisite
------------

Removing a process does not shut down the process. If you are removing a
**managed** process and do not want to leave the process running after
removal, then :doc:`shut down the process
</tutorial/shut-down-deployment>` before removing it.
