To return information on query plans and execution statistics of the
query plans, MongoDB provides:

- the :method:`db.collection.explain()` method,

- the :method:`cursor.explain()` method, and

- the :dbcommand:`explain` command.

.. important::

   - Only the most important output fields are shown on this page.

   - The output is subject to change.

   - Some fields are for internal use and are not documented.

.. _explain-output-structure:

Explain Output Structure
------------------------

The ``explain`` results present the query plans as a tree of stages. 
The output structure can differ based on which query engine the 
operation uses. Operations can use the classic query engine or the 
:ref:`slot-based execution query engine <5.1-rel-notes-sbe>`.

To see how the output structure can differ between the two execution 
engines, see the following examples:

   tabs:

      - id: classic-sample-output
        name: "Classic Execution Engine"

            .. code-block:: javascript
               :copyable: false

               winningPlan: {
                  stage: <STAGE1>,
                  ...
                  inputStage: {
                     stage: <STAGE2>,
                     ...
                     inputStage: {
                        stage: <STAGE3>,
                        ...
                     }

            .. code-block:: javascript
               :copyable: false

               winningPlan: {
                  queryPlan: {
                     stage: <STAGE1>,
                     ...
                     inputStage: {
                        stage: <STAGE2>,
                        ...
                        inputStage: {
                           stage: <STAGE3>,
                           ...
                        }
                     }
                  }

                     ...  
                  }
               },

Each stage passes its resulting documents or index keys to the
parent node. The leaf nodes access the collection or the indices. The
internal nodes use the documents or the index keys that result from the 
child nodes. The root node indicates the stage that MongoDB ultimately 
derives the result set from.

Stages are descriptive of the operation. For example:

- ``COLLSCAN`` for a collection scan

- ``IXSCAN`` for scanning index keys

- ``FETCH`` for retrieving documents

- ``GROUP`` for grouping documents

- ``SHARD_MERGE`` for merging results from shards

- ``SHARDING_FILTER`` for filtering out orphan documents from shards

.. data:: explain.queryPlanner

   Contains information on the selection of the query plan by the
   :doc:`query optimizer </core/query-plans>`.

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.namespace

      A string that specifies the :term:`namespace` with the names of
      the database and the collection accessed by the query. The
      namespace has the format ``<database>.<collection>``.

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.indexFilterSet

      A boolean that specifies whether MongoDB applied an :ref:`index
      filter <index-filters>` for the :term:`query shape`.

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.queryHash

      A hexadecimal string that represents the hash of the
      :term:`query shape` and is dependent only on the query shapes.
      ``queryHash`` can help identify slow queries (including the
      query filter of write operations) with the same query shape.

      .. note::

         As with any hash function, two different query shapes may result
         in the same hash value. However, the occurrence of hash
         collisions between different query shapes is unlikely.

      For more information on ``queryHash`` and ``planCacheKey``,
      see :ref:`query-hash-plan-cache-key`.

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.planCacheKey

      A hash of the key for the plan cache entry associated with the
      query.

      Unlike the :data:`explain.queryPlanner.queryHash`, the
      :data:`explain.queryPlanner.planCacheKey` is a function of
      both the query shape and the currently available indexes for
      that shape. That is, if indexes that can support the query
      shape are added/dropped, the ``planCacheKey`` value may change
      whereas the ``queryHash`` value would not change.

      For more information on ``queryHash`` and ``planCacheKey``,
      see :ref:`query-hash-plan-cache-key`.

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.optimizedPipeline

      A boolean that indicates that the entire aggregation pipeline
      operation was optimized away, and instead, fulfilled by a tree
      of query plan execution stages.

      For example, starting in MongodB 4.2, the following
      aggregation operation can be fulfilled by the tree of query
      plan execution rather than using the aggregation pipeline.
      
      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.example.aggregate([ { $match: { someFlag: true } } ] )

      The field is only present if the value is ``true`` and only
      applies to explain on aggregation pipeline operations. When
      ``true``, because the pipeline was optimized away, no
      aggregation stage information appears in the output.

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan

      A document that details the plan selected by the :doc:`query
      optimizer </core/query-plans>`. 

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.stage

      A string that denotes the name of the stage.

      Each stage consists of information specific to the stage. For 
      example, an ``IXSCAN`` stage will include the index bounds along 
      with other data specific to the index scan. If a stage has a child 
      stage or multiple child stages, the stage will have an 
      ``inputStage`` or ``inputStages``.

      This field appears if the operation used the classic query
      execution engine. 

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStage

      A document that describes the child stage, which provides the 
      documents or index keys to its parent. The field is present *if* 
      the parent stage has only one child.

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStages

      An array of documents describing the child stages. Child stages 
      provide the documents or index keys to the parent stage. The field 
      is present *if* the parent stage has multiple child nodes. 
      For example, stages for :ref:`$or expressions
      <explain-output-or-expression>` or :ref:`index intersection
      <explain-output-index-intersection>` consume input from multiple 
      sources.

      This field appears if the operation used the classic query
      execution engine. 

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.queryPlan

      A document that details the plan selected by the :doc:`query
      optimizer </core/query-plans>`. MongoDB presents the plan as a tree
      of stages. 
      
      This document appears if the query used the :ref:`slot-based 
      execution query engine <5.1-rel-notes-sbe>`.
      
      .. versionadded:: 5.1

      .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.queryPlan.stage

         A string that denotes the name of the stage.

         Each stage consists of information specific to the stage. For
         instance, an ``IXSCAN`` stage will include the index bounds
         along with other data specific to the index scan.

         Starting in MongoDB 5.2, MongoDB can execute some 
         :pipeline:`$group` stages using the :ref:`slot-based execution 
         query engine <5.1-rel-notes-sbe>`. When the |sbe-short| is used
         for :pipeline:`$group`, this field value is ``GROUP``.

      .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.queryPlan.planNodeId

         Unique integer field that identifies each stage in the execution
         plan. Field is included in all stages throughout the ``explain``
         results.

         .. versionadded:: 5.1
      
      .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.queryPlan.inputStage

         See :data:`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStage`.

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.slotBasedPlan

      Document with information about the slot based query execution plan
      tree and stages.

      .. versionadded:: 5.1

.. data:: explain.queryPlanner.rejectedPlans

   Array of candidate plans considered and rejected by the
   query optimizer. The array can be empty if there were no other
   candidate plans.

.. _executionStats:

``executionStats``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The returned :data:`explain.executionStats` information details the
execution of the winning plan. In order to include
``executionStats`` in the results, you must run the explain in either:

- :ref:`executionStats <explain-method-executionStats>` or

- :ref:`allPlansExecution <explain-method-allPlansExecution>`
  verbosity mode. Use ``allPlansExecution`` mode to include partial
  execution data captured during :ref:`plan selection
  <query-plans-query-optimization>`.

These examples may combine the output structures of MongoDB's classic
and slot-based execution engines. They are not meant to be 
representative. Your output may differ significantly.

.. data:: explain.executionStats

   Contains statistics that describe the completed query execution for
   the winning plan. For write operations, completed query execution
   refers to the modifications that *would* be performed, but does
   *not* apply the modifications to the database.

   .. data:: explain.executionStats.nReturned

      Number of documents that match the query condition.
      :data:`~explain.executionStats.nReturned` corresponds to the ``n`` field
      returned by ``cursor.explain()`` in earlier versions of MongoDB.

   .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionTimeMillis

      Total time in milliseconds required for query plan selection and
      query execution. :data:`explain.executionStats.executionTimeMillis` corresponds
      to the ``millis`` field returned by ``cursor.explain()`` in
      earlier versions of MongoDB.

   .. data:: explain.executionStats.totalKeysExamined

      Number of index entries scanned.
      :data:`explain.executionStats.totalKeysExamined` corresponds to the
      ``nscanned`` field returned by ``cursor.explain()`` in
      earlier versions of MongoDB.

   .. data:: explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined

      Number of documents examined during query execution. Common
      query execution stages that examine documents are ``COLLSCAN``
      and ``FETCH``.

      .. note::

         :data:`explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined` refers to
         the total number of documents examined and *not* to the
         number of documents returned. For example, a stage can
         examine a document in order to apply a filter. If the
         document is filtered out, then it has been examined but
         will not be returned as part of the query result set.

         If a document is examined multiple times during query
         execution,
         :data:`explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined` counts
         each examination. That is,
         :data:`explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined` is *not* a
         count of the total number of *unique* documents examined.

   .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages

      Details the completed execution of the winning plan as a tree of
      stages; i.e. a stage can have an ``inputStage`` or multiple
      ``inputStages``.

      Starting in MongoDB 5.1, a stage can have these input stages:
      
      - ``thenStage``
      - ``elseStage``
      - ``innerStage``
      - ``outerStage``

      Each stage consists of execution information specific to the
      stage.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.executionTimeMillisEstimate

         The estimated amount of time in milliseconds for query execution.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.opens

         Starting in MongoDB 5.1, the number of times a stage was
         opened during query execution.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.closes

         Starting in MongoDB 5.1, the number of times a stage was
         closed during query execution.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.works

         Specifies the number of "work units" performed by the query 
         execution stage. Query execution divides its work into small 
         units. A "work unit" might consist of examining a single index 
         key, fetching a single document from the collection, applying 
         a projection to a single document, or doing a piece of internal 
         bookkeeping.

         This field appears if the operation used the classic query
         execution engine. 

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.saveState

         The number of times that the query stage suspended processing
         and saved its current execution state, for example in
         preparation for yielding its locks.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.restoreState

         The number of times that the query stage restored a saved
         execution state, for example after recovering locks that it had
         previously yielded.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.isEOF

         Specifies whether the execution stage has reached end of stream:

         - If ``true`` or ``1``, the execution stage has reached
           end-of-stream.

         - If ``false`` or ``0``, the stage may still have results to
           return. For example, consider a query with a limit whose
           execution stages consists of a ``LIMIT`` stage with an
           input stage of ``IXSCAN`` for the query. If the query
           returns more than the specified limit, the ``LIMIT`` stage
           will report ``isEOF: 1``, but its underlying ``IXSCAN`` stage
           will report ``isEOF: 0``.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.inputStage

         Each ``inputStage`` can have different fields depending on the
         value of ``inputStage.stage``. The following table describes 
         possible fields and what stages they can appear in.

         Each ``inputStage`` can have another ``inputStage`` as a field.
         See :ref:`explain-output-structure`.

              - ``COLLSCAN``, ``FETCH``

            * - ``keysExamined``
              - For query execution stages that scan an index ``keysExamined`` 
                is the total number of in-bounds and out-of-bounds
                keys that are examined in the process of the index scan. If the
                index scan consists of a single contiguous range of keys, only
                in-bounds keys need to be examined. If the index bounds consists of
                several key ranges, the index scan execution process may examine
                out-of-bounds keys in order to skip from the end of one range to the
                beginning of the next.
              - ``IXSCAN``

            * - ``numReads``
              - The number of documents scanned or index keys examined during
                the query execution stage. 

                .. versionadded:: 5.1
              - ``COLLSCAN``, ``IXSCAN``

            * - ``seeks``
              - The number of times that we had to seek the index cursor to
                a new position in order to complete the index scan.
              - ``IXSCAN``
            
            * - ``spilledBytesApprox``
              - The approximate number of in-memory bytes spilled to disk in 
                the stage.

                .. versionadded:: 5.3
              - ``GROUP``

            * - ``spilledRecords``
              - The number of produced records spilled to disk in the stage.
                
                .. versionadded:: 5.3
              - ``GROUP``

            * - ``usedDisk``

                .. versionadded:: 5.3
              - ``GROUP``

   .. data:: explain.executionStats.allPlansExecution

      Contains *partial* execution information captured during the
      :ref:`plan selection phase <query-plans-query-optimization>` for
      both the winning and rejected plans. The field is present only if
      ``explain`` runs in ``allPlansExecution`` verbosity mode.

Execution Plan Statistics for Query with ``$lookup`` Pipeline Stage
-------------------------------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 5.0

The :ref:`explain results <explain-results>` can include execution
statistics for queries that use a :pipeline:`$lookup` pipeline stage. To
include those execution statistics, you must run the explain operation
in one of these execution verbosity modes:

- :ref:`executionStats <explain-method-executionStats>`
- :ref:`allPlansExecution <explain-method-allPlansExecution>`

The following fields are included in the explain results for a
:pipeline:`$lookup` query:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   '$lookup': {
      from: <string>,
      as: <string>,
      localField: <string>,
      foreignField: <string>
   },
   totalDocsExamined: <long>,
   totalKeysExamined: <long>,
   collectionScans: <long>,
   indexesUsed: [ <string_1>, <string_2>, ..., <string_n> ],
   nReturned: <long>,
   executionTimeMillisEstimate: <long>

To see the descriptions for the fields in the ``$lookup`` section, see
the :pipeline:`$lookup` page.

The other fields are:

.. data:: explain.totalDocsExamined

   Number of documents examined during the query execution.

.. data:: explain.totalKeysExamined

   Number of index keys examined.

.. data:: explain.collectionScans

   Number of times a collection scan occurred during query execution.
   During a collection scan, each document in a collection is compared
   to the query predicate. Collection scans occur if no appropriate
   :ref:`index <indexes>` exists that :ref:`covers
   <indexes-covered-queries>` the query.

.. data:: explain.indexesUsed

   Array of strings with the names of the indexes used by the query.

.. data:: explain.nReturned

   Number of documents that match the query condition.

.. data:: explain.executionTimeMillisEstimate

   Estimated time in milliseconds for the query execution.


.. _explain-output-collection-scan:

Collection Scan
---------------

If the query planner selects a collection scan, the explain result
includes a ``COLLSCAN`` stage.

If the query planner selects an index, the explain result includes a
``IXSCAN`` stage. The stage includes information such as the index
key pattern, direction of traversal, and index bounds.

Starting in MongoDB 5.3, if the query planner selects a :ref:`clustered
index <db.createCollection.clusteredIndex>` for a :ref:`clustered
collection <clustered-collections>`, the explain result includes a
``CLUSTERED_IXSCAN`` stage. The stage includes information about the
clustered index key and index bounds.

For more information on execution statistics of collection scans, see
:doc:`/tutorial/analyze-query-plan`.

.. _explain-output-covered-queries:

Covered Queries
---------------

When an index covers a query, MongoDB can both match the query
conditions **and** return the results using only the index keys; i.e.
MongoDB does not need to examine documents from the collection to
return the results.

When an index covers a query, the explain result has an ``IXSCAN``
stage that is **not** a descendant of a ``FETCH`` stage, and in the
:ref:`executionStats`, the :data:`explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined` 
is ``0``.

.. _explain-output-index-intersection:

Index Intersection
------------------

For an :doc:`index intersection plan </core/index-intersection>`, the
result will include either an ``AND_SORTED`` stage or an ``AND_HASH``
stage with an :data:`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStages` array that
details the indexes; e.g.:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      stage : 'AND_SORTED',
      inputStages : [
         {
            stage : 'IXSCAN',
            ...
         },
         {
            stage : 'IXSCAN',
            ...
         }
      ]
   }

.. _explain-output-or-expression:

``$or`` Expression
------------------

If MongoDB uses indexes for an :query:`$or` expression, the result will
include the ``OR`` stage with an
:data:`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStages` array that
details the indexes; e.g.:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      stage: 'OR',
      inputStages: [
         {
            stage: 'IXSCAN',
            ...
         },
         {
            stage : 'IXSCAN',
            ...
         },
         ...
      ]
   }

In previous versions of MongoDB, ``cursor.explain()`` returned the
``clauses`` array that detailed the indexes.

.. _sort-and-group-executionStats-and-above:

``$sort`` and ``$group`` Stages
-------------------------------

When ``explain`` is run in either  
:ref:`executionStats <explain-method-executionStats>` or 
:ref:`allPlansExecution <explain-method-allPlansExecution>` verbosity 
mode, the :pipeline:`$sort` and :pipeline:`$group` stages have 
additional output.

     - ``totalOutputDataSizeBytes``
     
     - long

     - An estimate of the total size of all documents output by the 
       :pipeline:`$group` stage in bytes.

   * - :pipeline:`$group`
 
     - ``usedDisk``

     - boolean

     - Whether the :pipeline:`$group` stage wrote to disk. 

.. _explain-output-sort:

Sort Stage
----------

If MongoDB cannot use an index or indexes to obtain the sort order, the
results include a ``SORT`` stage indicating a blocking sort operation.
Blocking sorts do not block concurrent operations on the
collection or database. The name refers to the requirement that the
``SORT`` stage reads all input documents before returning any output
documents, blocking the flow of data for that specific query.

If MongoDB requires using more than 100 megabytes of system memory for
the blocking sort operation, MongoDB returns an error *unless* the query
specifies :method:`cursor.allowDiskUse()` (*New in MongoDB 4.4*).
:method:`cursor.allowDiskUse()` allows MongoDB to use temporary files
on disk to store data exceeding the 100 megabyte system memory limit
while processing a blocking sort operation. If the explain plan does not
contain an explicit ``SORT`` stage, then MongoDB can use an index to
obtain the sort order.
