Overview
--------

Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without
indexes, MongoDB must scan *every* document in a collection to find the
documents that match each query. Collection scans are slow and can
negatively affect the performance of your application. When an
appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB uses that index to limit
the number of documents scanned, thus improving query performance. 

The :manual:`indexes section </indexes>` of the MongoDB manual provides a
detailed overview of indexes in MongoDB.

Query Coverage and Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you execute a query against MongoDB, your query can include three
parts:

- query criteria that specify field(s) and value(s) you are looking for,
- options that affect the query's execution (e.g. read concern),

- (optional) projection criteria to specify the fields MongoDB should
  return

When all the fields specified in the query criteria and projection of a
query are indexed, MongoDB returns results directly from the index
without scanning any documents or bringing documents into memory. Queries
that use indexes are more performant than queries that rely on
collection scans.

The MongoDB manual addresses both :manual:`query coverage
</core/query-optimization/#read-operations-covered-query>` and
:manual:`index intersection </core/index-intersection>` (using numerous
indexes to fulfil a query) in more detail.

Operational Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve query performance, you should build indexes on fields that
appear often in queries and for all operations that involve sorted
results. Each index that you add consumes disk space and memory when
active so you should track index memory and disk usage for capacity
planning. In addition, when a write operation updates an indexed field,
MongoDB also has to update the index. Familiarize yourself with the :manual:`Indexing Strategies </applications/indexes>` and :manual:`Data Modeling and Indexes </core/data-model-operations/#data-model-indexes>` documentation when designing your data model and choosing the indexes appropriate for your application.

Index Types
-----------

MongoDB supports a number of different index types to support querying
your data. The following sections describe the most common index types
and provide sample code that creates each index type.

Single Field and Compound Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:manual:`Single field indexes </core/index-single>` are user-defined ascending or descending indexes on
a single field of a document. 

The following example uses the ``createIndex()`` method to create an
ascending index on the ``title`` field in the ``movies`` collection in
the ``sample_mflix`` database.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/single-field.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-ex
   :end-before: end-ex

:manual:`Compound indexes </core/index-compound>` are user-defined indexes on *multiple* fields. When you create a compound index, you specify the direction (i.e. ascending or descending) for each field in the index.

The following example uses the ``createIndex()`` method to create a compound index on the ``type`` and ``genre`` fields in the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/compound.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-ex
   :end-before: end-ex

Multikey Indexes (Indexes on Array Fields)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:manual:`Multikey indexes </core/index-multikey>` are user-defined ascending or descending indexes on
fields that contain an array value. You define a multikey index in the
same fashion as you would single and compound indexes: you do not 
need to explicitly specify that an index is multikey.

The following example use the ``createIndex()`` method to create an ascending index on the ``cast`` field in the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/multikey.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-ex
   :end-before: end-ex

Multikey indexes behave differently from non-multikey indexes in terms of
query coverage, index bound computation, and sort behavior. For a full
explanation of multikey indexes, including a discussion of their behavior
and limitations, refer to the :manual:`Multikey Indexes page
</core/index-multikey>` in the MongoDB manual.

Text Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:manual:`Text indexes </core/index-text>` support :doc:`text search queries </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/text>` on
string content. ``text`` indexes can include any field whose value is a
string or an array of string elements. MongoDB supports text search for
various languages. You can specify the default language as an option when
creating the index.

The following example uses the ``createIndex()`` method to create a
``text`` index on the ``fullplot`` field in the ``movies`` collection in
the ``sample_mflix`` database and specifies the default language to be
``english``.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/text.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-ex
   :end-before: end-ex

For a full explanation of text search with MongoDB, refer to :manual:`Text Indexes </core/index-text>` in the MongoDB manual.

Geospatial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports queries of geospatial coordinate data using :manual:`2dsphere </core/2dsphere>` indexes. With a ``2dsphere`` index, you can query for inclusion, intersection, and proximity. The :manual:`Geospatial Queries page </geospatial-queries>` in the MongoDB manual provides a detailed explanation of geospatial query operations in MongoDB.

.. seealso::
   
   The :doc:`/fundamentals/crud/read-operations/geo` guide for an
   overview of working with geospatial data with MongoDB and Node.js.

To create a ``2dsphere`` index, the field you are indexing must be a :manual:`GeoJSON object </reference/geojson>`. The ``location.geo`` field in following sample document from the ``theaters`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database is a GeoJSON point object that describes the coordinates of the specified theater:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("59a47286cfa9a3a73e51e75c"),
      "theaterId" : 104,
      "location" : {
         "address" : {
            "street1" : "5000 W 147th St",
            "city" : "Hawthorne",
            "state" : "CA",
            "zipcode" : "90250"
         },
         "geo" : {
            "type" : "Point",
            "coordinates" : [
               -118.36559,
               33.897167
            ]
         }
      }
   }

The following example uses the ``createIndexes()`` method to create a
``2dsphere`` index on the ``location.geo`` field in the ``theaters``
collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/geo.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-ex
   :end-before: end-ex


MongoDB also supports :manual:`2d </core/index-2d>` indexes for
calculating distances on a Euclidean plane and for working with the
"legacy coordinate pairs" syntax used in MongoDB 2.2 and earlier. If you
need to calculate distances on a 2d plane, use a 2d index, rather than a
2dsphere.

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unique indexes ensure that the indexed fields do not store duplicate
values. By default, MongoDB creates a unique index on the ``_id`` field
during the creation of a collection. To create a unique index use the ``unique`` option set to ``true`` when you create the index. Unique indexes have their own restrictions and behavioral considerations. Refer to the :manual:`Unique Indexes page </core/index-unique>` in the MongoDB manual for a full explanation.

The following example uses the ``createIndex()`` method to create a unique ascending index on the ``theaterId`` field in the ``theaters`` collection of the ``sample_mflix`` database.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/unique.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-ex
   :end-before: end-ex
