.. dbcommand:: validate

   The ``validate`` command checks the contents of a namespace by
   scanning a collection's data and indexes for correctness. The command
   can be slow, particularly on larger data sets:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { validate: "users" }

   This command will validate the contents of the collection named
   ``users``. You may also specify one of the following
   options:

   - ``full: true`` provides a more thorough scan of the data.

   - ``scandata: false`` skips the scan of the base collection
      without skipping the scan of the index.

   The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell also provides a wrapper:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.validate();

   Use one of the following forms to perform the full collection
   validation:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.validate(true)
      db.runCommand( { validate: "collection", full: true } )

   .. warning:: This command is resource intensive and may have an
      impact on the performance of your MongoDB instance.
