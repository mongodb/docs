Data tables represent data in a tabular view, similar to a
`spreadsheet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet>`_. Data tables
split your data into categories, with each categorization field
represented in the table columns. The unique categories are represented
as the table rows, and |charts-short| displays aggregated values in the
table body based on the fields selected.

Data Table Encoding Channels
----------------------------

Data tables use the following :ref:`encoding channels
<encoding-channels>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Encoding Channel
     - Description

   * - Groups
     - The :guilabel:`category` encoding channels. |charts-short|
       creates a row in the table for each unique value in this field.
       When multiple :guilabel:`Groups` are added to the chart,
       |charts-short| creates a row for each unique combination of
       group fields.

       .. note::

          The :guilabel:`Groups` encoding channel supports
          :ref:`binning <charts-bin-data>` for numeric and date fields.

   * - Values
     - The :guilabel:`aggregation` encoding channels. |charts-short|
       creates a column for each field mapped into the
       :guilabel:`Values` channel. |charts-short|
       aggregates the encoded :guilabel:`Values` fields using the
       selected aggregation methods and populates the grid cells with
       the aggregated value for the corresponding :guilabel:`Group`.

   * - Dynamic Columns
     - A second :guilabel:`Category` encoding channel. When you use
       :guilabel:`Dynamic Columns`, |charts-short| creates table
       columns based on the unique values retrieved from the field
       mapped into the :guilabel:`Dynamic Columns` channel.
       |charts-short| uses the field mapped into the :guilabel:`Values`
       channel to populate the grid cells, aggregated against both the
       :guilabel:`Group` and :guilabel:`Dynamic Column` categories.

       You cannot apply dynamic columns to a table if you have selected
       multiple :guilabel:`Value` encoding channels.

       For an example of how to use dynamic columns, see the following
       :ref:`example <dynamic-col-example>`.

       .. note::

          The :guilabel:`Dynamic Columns` encoding channel supports
          :ref:`binning <charts-bin-data>` for numeric and date fields.

Use Cases
---------

Data tables have a wide variety of applications, but are most useful
when comparing multiple categories of calculated values. Visual charts
struggle to display multiple categories of data without losing their
audience. Data tables present data with multiple categories such that
you can see which value applies to which slice of data.

Data tables are also useful for showing precise data values, rather
than comparing approximate values. Comparing approximate values is
best done with a visual representation, instead of text.

You can use data tables to show:

- The total cost to rent an apartment, including rent, cleaning fees,
  and security deposits organized by location and total area of the
  unit.

- Time spent working out and total calories burned during various
  exercises categorized by the type of exercise and time of day the
  exercised was performed.


Limitations
-----------

The maximum query response size for a data table is 50000 documents.

Examples
--------

The following data table examples visualize data from a hospitality
and property service. Each document in the collection
represents a unit available for rent and includes information such as
the monthly unit price, neighborhood, and property type.

Basic Data Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following data table categorizes the rental listings by property
type and location, and shows the average review rating and average
weekly rent for each group:

.. figure:: /images/charts/data-table-basic-example.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Basic Data Table Example

The :guilabel:`Group` encoding channels of ``property_type`` and
``suburb`` create a row in the data table for each unique combination
of those two fields in the data.

The :guilabel:`Values` of ``review_scores_rating`` and
``weekly_price`` each add a column to the table. For both values, we
average the rating and price for each ``property type`` and ``suburb``
using :manual:`aggregation </aggregation>` and display the results in
the data table.

The results are formatted using the Customization tab to display the
mean weekly price as currency and round the mean review score to an
appropriate number of decimal places.

.. note::

   We have applied a :ref:`filter <charts-filter-documents>` to this
   chart to only display listings which have a ``weekly_price``
   associated with them.

.. _dynamic-col-example:

Data Table with Dynamic Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following data table displays nearly the same data as the previous
basic data table example. In this example, instead of making
``property_type`` and ``suburb`` :guilabel:`Groups`, ``property_type``
field is now a :guilabel:`Dynamic Column`:

.. figure:: /images/charts/data-table-dynamic-example.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Basic Data Table Example

Now, rather than having two category columns in the table, the
``property_types`` become column titles. We are still aggregating
the mean of the ``weekly_price`` based on each combination of
``property_type`` and ``suburb``.

The results are formatted using the Customization tab to display the
mean weekly price as currency.

.. note::

   Blank table cells indicate that there are no documents that match
   the corresponding intersection of ``property_type`` and ``suburb``.
