You can pause, resume, or terminate your {+clusters+}. For
{+serverless-instances+}, see :doc:`Terminate a Serverless Instance
</terminate-serverless-instance>`.

Considerations for Paused Clusters
----------------------------------

- You can't:

  - Change the configuration of a paused cluster.
  - Read data from or write data to a paused cluster.

- For paused clusters, |service|:

  - Stops triggering configured alerts.
  - Stops all backups. Your existing snapshots remain until they expire.

.. _pause-cluster:

Pause One Cluster
-----------------

.. include:: /includes/serverless-preview-dont-use.rst

Depending on your cluster tier, |service| either pauses clusters
automatically or when you manually initiate it.

To pause a cluster with the {+atlas-admin-api+}, see 
:ref:`modify-one-cluster-ref`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: M10+
      :tabid: m10+

      You can pause ``M10`` or larger clusters:

      - If they do not use :ref:`NVMe storage <nvme-storage>`. 
      - For up to 30 days. If you don't resume the cluster within 30 
        days, |service| resumes the cluster.
      
      |service| only charges paused clusters for storage. |service| does
      not charge for any other services or data transfer on paused
      clusters.

      To pause |a-service| cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/pause-cluster.rst

   .. tab:: M0
      :tabid: m0
      
      |service| automatically stops collecting monitoring information
      for an ``M0`` cluster after a few days of inactivity.

      If there is no activity for 60 days, then |service| automatically
      pauses the cluster completely, disallowing any connections to it
      until you resume the cluster. |service| sends an email seven days
      before pausing the cluster. |service| sends another email after
      pausing the cluster.
      
      You can :ref:`resume <resume-cluster>` or :ref:`terminate
      <terminate-cluster>` an automatically paused
      cluster at any time. You can't initiate a pause for ``M0``
      clusters.
      
.. _resume-cluster:

Resume One Cluster
------------------

.. include:: /includes/serverless-preview-dont-use.rst

To resume collection of monitoring information for |a-service| ``M0``
cluster paused for monitoring, connect to that cluster using a
:doc:`MongoDB Driver </driver-connection>`, {+mongosh+}, or
:doc:`Data Explorer </atlas-ui>`.

To resume |a-service| ``M0`` cluster that |service| paused due to
inactivity, or |a-service| ``M10+`` cluster that you paused previously:

.. include:: /includes/steps/resume-cluster.rst

.. note::

   If you don't resume an ``M10+`` cluster within 30 days, |service|
   resumes the cluster.

.. _terminate-cluster:

Terminate One Cluster
---------------------

To terminate |a-service| cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/terminate-atlas-cluster.rst

|service| terminates the cluster after completing any in-progress
deployment changes.

|service| bills for the hours that the cluster was active. To learn
more about |service| billing, see :doc:`/billing`.

.. warning::

   Terminating a cluster also deletes any backup snapshots for that
   cluster. See :ref:`retention-policy`.

.. tabs:: 
   :hidden:

   .. tab:: M10+
      :tabid: m10+

      .. note:: Public IP Address Retention

         When you terminate a cluster with a lifetime of 12 hours or 
         more, |service| reserves the cluster's public |ipaddr| 
         address, bound to its original cluster name.

         The following time frames apply from the moment you
         terminate the cluster:

         .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1
            :widths: 10 30
   
            * - Cluster Lifetime
              - IP Address Retention
  
            * - Less than 12 hours
              - Not retained

            * - 12 to 35 hours
              - 12 to 35 hours (equal to the cluster lifetime)
   
            * - 36 hours or more
              - 36 hours
    
         If, in the applicable time frame, you create a new cluster 
         with the same name, |service| reassigns the reserved public 
         |ipaddr| address to that cluster.

         Cluster |ipaddr| addresses don't change when you or |service|
         pause or resume clusters.

      :tabid: m0
