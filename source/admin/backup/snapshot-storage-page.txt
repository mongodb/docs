MongoDB database backups called *snapshots* and they are stored in
containers called *snapshot stores*. This page lists existing snapshot
stores and allows you to create or modify snapshot stores.

|mms| supports the following snapshot stores:

- On a File System,
- In a MongoDB database (:opsmgr:`blockstore </reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-blockstore-database>`), or
- In an S3 Bucket (S3 blockstore)

   * - File system
     - File system store
     - Snapshots are stored in a directory on a file system. Each
       snapshot is found in its own sub-directory. The snapshot files
       can be compressed individually based upon its
       :setting:`File System Store Gzip Compression Level`.
       To create or edit a file system store, see
       :doc:`/tutorial/manage-filestore-storage`.

   * - Database storage
     - blockstore
     - Snapshots are stored in a managed MongoDB database in a
       compressed, de-duplicated format. Depending on data usage
       patterns the :term:`deduplication` can provide significant
       storage savings without the need for any specialized hardware or
       other software. To create or edit a blockstore, see
       :doc:`/tutorial/manage-blockstore-storage`

   * - |aws| |s3| bucket
     - |s3| blockstore
     - Snapshot data is stored as blocks in an
       |aws| `S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`_ bucket. Snapshot
       metadata is stored in a managed MongoDB database. The metadata
       database tracks which blocks comprise each snapshot. The blocks
       are compressed and de-duplicated. To create or edit an S3
       blockstore, see :doc:`/tutorial/manage-s3-blockstore-storage`

You can add, edit or delete any snapshot store listed.
