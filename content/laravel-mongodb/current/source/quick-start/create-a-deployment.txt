Create a MongoDB Deployment
===========================

You can create a free tier MongoDB deployment on MongoDB Atlas
to store and manage your data. MongoDB Atlas hosts and manages
your MongoDB database in the cloud.

   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create a free MongoDB deployment on Atlas

      Complete the `MongoDB Get Started <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/get-started/?language=php>`__
      guide to set up a new Atlas account and load sample data into a new free
      tier MongoDB deployment. Follow the instructions in the :guilabel:`Cloud Deployment`
      tabs to create your MongoDB Atlas deployment in the cloud.

   .. step:: Save your credentials

      After you create your database user, save that user's
      username and password to a safe location for use in an upcoming step.

After completing these steps, you have a new free tier MongoDB deployment on
Atlas, database user credentials, and sample data loaded into your database.
