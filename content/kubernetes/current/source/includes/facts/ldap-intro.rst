`MongoDB Enterprise <http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise?jmp=docs>`_
supports:

- Proxying authentication requests to a Lightweight Directory Access
  Protocol (LDAP) service.
- Simple and SASL binding to LDAP servers. MongoDB Enterprise can bind
  to an LDAP server via ``saslauthd`` or through the operating system
  libraries.

To learn more, see the :manual:`LDAP Proxy Authentication </core/security-ldap>`
and :manual:`LDAP Authorization </core/security-ldap-external>` sections
in the MongoDB Server documentation.
