Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to retrieve data from a
MongoDB collection by using read operations. You can call the ``find()`` method to
retrieve documents that match a set of criteria specified in a query filter.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

The documents in this collection are modeled by the following {+language+} data class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/retrieve.kt
   :start-after: start-data-class
   :end-before: end-data-class
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:

.. _kotlin-sync-retrieve-find:

Find Documents
--------------

The ``find()`` method retrieves documents from a collection. This
method takes a **query filter** and returns all matching documents. A query filter is a
document that specifies the criteria that the driver uses to match documents from the
collection.

.. TODO: To learn more about query filters, see :ref:`kotlin-sync-specify-query`.

Find Documents Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``find()`` method to find all documents in which the
value of the ``cuisine`` field is ``"Spanish"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/retrieve.kt
   :start-after: start-find
   :end-before: end-find
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

The ``find()`` operation in the preceding example returns a ``FindIterable`` object,
which you can iterate through by using the ``forEach()`` method, as shown in the following
example:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/read/retrieve.kt
      :start-after: start-find-iterate
      :end-before: end-find-iterate
      :language: kotlin
      :dedent:
   
   .. output::
      :visible: false

      Restaurant(name=Tropicoso Club, cuisine=Spanish)
      Restaurant(name=Beso, cuisine=Spanish)
      Restaurant(name=Sabor Latino Restaurant, cuisine=Spanish)
      ...

.. note:: Find All Documents
 
   To find all documents in a collection, pass an empty filter to the ``find()`` method:

   .. literalinclude:: /includes/read/retrieve.kt
      :start-after: start-find-all
      :end-before: end-find-all
      :language: kotlin
      :copyable:
      :dedent:

Modify Find Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``find()`` method by chaining methods to
the ``find()`` method call. The following table describes commonly used methods used for
modifying queries:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``batchSize()`` 
     - | Limits the number of documents to return per batch. To learn more about
         batch size, see :manual:`cursor.batchSize() </reference/method/cursor.batchSize/>`
         in the MongoDB Server manual.

   * - ``collation()`` 
     - | Sets the collation options for the query. 

   * - ``comment()`` 
     - | Specifies a string to attach to the query. This can help you trace and interpret the
         operation in the server logs and in profile data. To learn more about query comments, 
         see :manual:`$comment </reference/operator/query/comment/>` in the MongoDB Server
         manual.
   
   * - ``hint()`` 
     - | Specifies the index to use for the query.

   * - ``limit()``
     - | Limits the number of documents to be returned from the query.

   * - ``maxTime()`` 
     - | Sets the maximum execution time on the server for this operation.

   * - ``skip()``
     - | Sets the number of documents to skip.

   * - ``sort()``
     - | Defines the sort criteria to apply to the query.

The following example chains the ``limit()`` and ``maxTime()`` methods to limit the
number of documents returned by the query to ``10`` and set a maximum execution time of
``10000`` milliseconds on the operation:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/retrieve.kt
   :start-after: start-modified-find
   :end-before: end-modified-find
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

For a full list of methods that modify the behavior of ``find()``, see the `API documentation <{+api+}/mongodb-driver-kotlin-sync/com.mongodb.kotlin.client/-find-iterable/index.html>`__
for the ``FindIterable`` class.
