The shard key determines the distribution of the collection's :term:`documents
<document>` among the cluster's :term:`shards <shard>`. The shard key is
either an indexed :term:`field` or indexed :term:`compound <compound index>`
fields that exists in every document in the collection.

MongoDB :term:`partitions <data partition>` data in the collection using ranges
of shard key values. Each range defines a non-overlapping range of shard key
values and is associated with a :term:`chunk`.

MongoDB attempts to distribute chunks evenly among the shards in the cluster.
The shard key has a direct relationship to the effectiveness of chunk
distribution. See :ref:`sharding-shard-key-selection`.

Shard Key Specification
-----------------------

To shard a collection, you must specify the target collection and the
shard key to the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.shardCollection( namespace, key )

- The ``namespace`` parameter consists of a string
  ``<database>.<collection>`` specifying the full :term:`namespace` of
  the target collection.

- The ``key`` parameter consists of a document containing a field and
  the index traversal direction for that field.

.. important::

   - Once you shard a collection, the selection of the shard key is
     immutable; i.e. you cannot select a different shard key for that
     collection.

For instructions sharding a collection using either the :ref:`hashed
<sharding-hashed>` or :ref:`ranged sharding <sharding-ranged>` strategy,
see :ref:`deploy-hashed-sharded-cluster-shard-collection`.

.. _update-shard-key:

Change a Document's Shard Key Value
-----------------------------------

.. topic:: When updating the shard key value

   .. include:: /includes/shard-key-modification-requirements.rst

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, you can update a document's shard key value
unless the shard key field is the immutable ``_id`` field. To update,
use the following operations to update a document's shard key value:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Command
     - Method

   * - :dbcommand:`update` with ``multi: false``
     - | :method:`db.collection.replaceOne()`
       | :method:`db.collection.updateOne()`
       | :method:`db.collection.update()` with ``multi: false``

   * - :dbcommand:`findAndModify`
     - | :method:`db.collection.findOneAndReplace()`
       | :method:`db.collection.findOneAndUpdate()`
       | :method:`db.collection.findAndModify()`

   * -
     - | :method:`db.collection.bulkWrite()`
       | :method:`Bulk.find.updateOne()`

       If the shard key modification results in moving the document to
       another shard, you cannot specify more than one shard key
       modification in the bulk operation; i.e. batch size of
       1.

       If the shard key modification does not result in moving the
       document to another shard, you can specify multiple shard
       key modification in the bulk operation.

Shard Key Indexes
-----------------

All sharded collections **must** have an index that supports the
:term:`shard key`; i.e. the index can be an index on the shard key or a
:term:`compound index` where the shard key is a :ref:`prefix
<compound-index-prefix>` of the index.

- If the collection is empty, :method:`sh.shardCollection()` creates
  the index on the shard key if such an index does not already exists.

- If the collection is not empty, you must create the index first
  before using :method:`sh.shardCollection()`.

If you drop the last valid index for the shard key, recover by
recreating an index on just the shard key.

.. _sharding-shard-key-unique:

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot specify a unique constraint on a :ref:`hashed index
<index-type-hashed>`.

For a ranged sharded collection, only the following indexes can be
:doc:`unique </core/index-unique>`:

- the index on the shard key

- a :term:`compound index` where the shard key is a :ref:`prefix
  <compound-index-prefix>`

- the default ``_id`` index; **however**, the ``_id`` index only
  enforces the uniqueness constraint per shard **if** the ``_id`` field
  is **not** the shard key or the prefix of the shard key.

  .. admonition:: Uniqueness and the ``_id`` Index
     :class: important

     If the ``_id`` field is not the shard key or the prefix of the
     shard key, ``_id`` index only enforces the uniqueness constraint
     per shard and **not** across shards.

     For example, consider a sharded collection (with shard key ``{x:
     1}``) that spans two shards A and B. Because the ``_id`` key is
     not part of the shard key, the collection could have a document
     with ``_id`` value ``1`` in shard A and another document with
     ``_id`` value ``1`` in shard B.

     If the ``_id`` field is not the shard key nor the prefix of the
     shard key, MongoDB expects applications to enforce the uniqueness
     of the ``_id`` values across the shards.

The unique index constraints mean that:

- For a to-be-sharded collection, you cannot shard the collection if
  the collection has other unique indexes.

- For an already-sharded collection, you cannot create unique indexes
  on other fields.

Through the use of the unique index on the shard key, MongoDB *can*
enforce uniqueness on the shard key values. MongoDB enforces uniqueness
on the *entire* key combination, and not individual components of the
shard key. To enforce uniqueness on the shard key values, pass the
``unique`` parameter as ``true`` to the :method:`sh.shardCollection()`
method:

Choosing a Shard Key
--------------------

The choice of shard key affects the creation and :ref:`distribution of
the chunks <sharding-balancing>` across the available :term:`shards
<shard>`. This affects the overall efficiency and performance of
operations within the sharded cluster.

The shard key affects the performance and efficiency of the
:ref:`sharding strategy <sharding-strategy>` used by the sharded cluster.

The ideal shard key allows MongoDB to distribute documents evenly throughout
the cluster.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-ranged-distribution-good.rst

At minimum, consider the consequences of the
:ref:`cardinality<shard-key-range>`, :ref:`frequency<shard-key-frequency>`, and
:ref:`monotonicity<shard-key-monotonic>` of a potential shard key.

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For restrictions on shard key, see :ref:`limits-shard-keys`.

Collection Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When sharding a collection that is not empty, the shard key can
constrain the maximum supported collection size for the initial
sharding operation only. See 
:limit:`Sharding Existing Collection Data Size`.

.. important::

   A sharded collection can grow to any size after successful sharding.

.. _shard-key-range:
.. _sharding-shard-key-cardinality:
.. _shard-key-cardinality:

Shard Key Cardinality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`cardinality` of a shard key determines the maximum number of chunks
the balancer can create. This can reduce or remove the effectiveness of
horizontal scaling in the cluster.

A unique shard key value can exist on no more than a single chunk at any
given time. If a shard key has a cardinality of ``4``, then there can
be no more than ``4`` chunks within the sharded cluster, each storing
one unique shard key value. This constrains the number of effective
shards in the cluster to ``4`` as well - adding additional shards would
not provide any benefit.

The following image illustrates a sharded cluster using the field
``X`` as the shard key. If ``X`` has low cardinality, the distribution of
inserts may look similar to the following:

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-ranged-distribution-low-cardinal.rst

The cluster in this example would *not* scale horizontally, as incoming writes
would only route to a subset of shards.

Choosing a shard key with high cardinality does not, on its own, 
guarantee even distribution of data across the sharded cluster. The 
:ref:`frequency <shard-key-frequency>` and 
:ref:`monotonicity <shard-key-monotonic>` of the shard key also 
contribute to data distribution. Take each factor into account when 
choosing a shard key.

If your data model requires sharding on a key that has low cardinality,
consider using a :term:`compound index` using a field that
has higher relative cardinality.

.. _shard-key-frequency:

Shard Key Frequency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider a set representing the range of shard key values - the ``frequency``
of the shard key represents how often a given value occurs in the data. If the
majority of documents contain only a subset of those values, then the chunks
storing those documents become a bottleneck within the cluster. Furthermore,
as those chunks grow, they may become :ref:`indivisible chunks <jumbo-chunks>`
as they cannot be split any further. This reduces or removes the effectiveness
of horizontal scaling within the cluster.

The following image illustrates a sharded cluster using the field ``X`` as the
shard key. If a subset of values for ``X`` occur with high frequency, the
distribution of inserts may look similar to the following:

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-ranged-distribution-frequency.rst

Choosing a shard key with low frequency does not, on its own, guarantee 
even distribution of data across the sharded cluster. 
The :ref:`cardinality <shard-key-cardinality>` and 
:ref:`monotonicity <shard-key-monotonic>` of the shard key also 
contribute to data distribution. Take each factor into account when 
choosing a shard key.

If your data model requires sharding on a key that has high frequency
values, consider using a :term:`compound index` using a unique or
low frequency value.

.. _shard-key-monotonic:

Shard Key Monotonicity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A shard key on a value that increases or decreases monotonically is more
likely to distribute inserts to a single shard within the cluster.

This occurs because every cluster has a chunk that captures a range with an
upper bound of :doc:`maxKey</reference/bson-types>`. ``maxKey`` always
compares as higher than all other values. Similarly, there is a chunk that
captures a range with a lower bound of :doc:`minKey</reference/bson-types>`.
``minKey`` always compares as lower than all other values.

If the shard key value is always increasing, all new inserts are routed to the
chunk with ``maxKey`` as the upper bound. If the shard key value is always
decreasing, all new inserts are routed to the chunk with ``minKey`` as the
lower bound. The shard containing that chunk becomes the bottleneck for write
operations.

The following image illustrates a sharded cluster using the field ``X``
as the shard key. If the values for ``X`` are monotonically increasing, the
distribution of inserts may look similar to the following:

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-monotonic-distribution.rst

If the shard key value was monotonically decreasing, then all inserts would
route to ``Chunk A`` instead.

Choosing a shard key that does not change monotonically does not, on 
its own, guarantee even distribution of data across the sharded cluster. 
The :ref:`cardinality<shard-key-cardinality>` and
:ref:`frequency<shard-key-frequency>` of the shard key also contribute
to data distribution. Take each factor into account when choosing a 
shard key.

If your data model requires sharding on a key that changes
monotonically, consider using :doc:`/core/hashed-sharding`.
