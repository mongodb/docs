  Using the procedure above, add the following keywords:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 30 70
     :header-rows: 1
  
     * - Keyword
       - Value
  
     * - **SERVER**
       - The hostname specified in the |service| connect dialog.

     * - **PORT**
       - The :abbr:`IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)`
         `port number <https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml>`_
         specified in the |service| connect dialog. The default is
         ``27015``.

     * - **DATABASE**
       - The database to use after connecting.

         .. note::

            Required when connecting with Microsoft Excel.

     * - **UID**
       - The username for the user that can access the active
         |service| database.
  
         .. example::
  
            The user ``myTestUser`` is authenticated against the
            ``admin`` database:
  
            ``myTestUser?source=admin``
  
         - If you are using Username and Password (``SCRAM-SHA-256``)
           authentication, the expected authenticating database is
           ``admin``.
  
         - If you are using LDAP (``PLAIN``) authentication, the
           expected authenticating database is ``$external``:

           .. example::

              myTestUser?source=$external
  
     * - **PWD**
       - The password associated with the :guilabel:`UID`.
