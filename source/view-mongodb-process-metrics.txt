To view the metrics for a specific MongoDB process in an 
|service| cluster, click that process from the :guilabel:`Clusters` 
view. You can monitor different aspects of your cluster in one place 
focused on a process. For more information about the 
:guilabel:`Clusters` view, see :ref:`view-cluster-details`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-cluster-metrics.rst

The |service| process view displays three tabs for monitoring metrics 
for the process:
 
- The :guilabel:`Status` tab displays the process metrics |service|
  collects from the selected :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` or
  :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` process.
 
- The :guilabel:`Hardware` tab displays hardware metrics for
  the host machine supporting the selected 
  :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` or :binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>`
  process.
 
- The :guilabel:`DB Stats` tab displays the database metrics for the
  selected database.
 
  |service| retrieves database metrics every 20 minutes by default but
  adjusts frequency when necessary to reduce the impact on database
  performance. If the collection of database statistics still affects
  performance, you can disable collection by clicking 
  :guilabel:`Settings` from the left-hand navigation, 
  then :guilabel:`Project Settings`, and then setting 
  :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics` to :guilabel:`No`.
 
  The view for each tab has three distinct sections:

Chart Controls
--------------
 
|service| provides the following controls for the :guilabel:`Status`,
:guilabel:`Hardware`, and :guilabel:`DB Stats` 
views. Adjusting any of these options affects all charts displayed 
under the selected view:

When viewing charts, you can do the following:

Chart Selection
---------------
 
|service| displays the available metrics to chart for the selected 
cluster under the :guilabel:`Toggle Charts` header. 

Charts marked with the ``+`` symbol are inactive, 
while charts marked with the ``-`` symbol are active. Click
on any chart to toggle the chart state.
