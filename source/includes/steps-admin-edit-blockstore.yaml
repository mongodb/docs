      * - Field

        - Contents

      * - :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>`

        - Type in one or more hosts in the ``<hostname:port>`` format
          that comprise the blockstore database.

          - If the blockstore database is a Replica Set or Sharded
            Cluster, type a comma-separated list of :program:`mongod`
            instances (for a Replica Set) or :program:`mongos`
            instances (for a Sharded Cluster).

            .. example::

               .. code-block:: sh

                  host1.example.com:27017,
                  host2.example.com:27017,
                  host2.example.com:27018

          - If the blockstore database is a standalone MongoDB
            instance, type the ``hostname:port`` of the instance.

      * - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Username` (Optional)

        - If the S3 blockstore database uses Username and Password
          (SCRAM-SHA-1) authentication, type the name of the user
          authorized to access the S3 blockstore database.

          Blockstore databases only support Username and Password
          (SCRAM-SHA-1) authentication.

          To enable Username and Password (SCRAM-SHA-1) authentication
          on your blockstore database, see :manual:`how to configure
          your database for SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication 
          </core/security-scram-sha-1>` in the MongoDB manual.

      * - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password` (Optional)

        - If the database uses Username and Password (SCRAM-SHA-1)
          authentication, type the password associated with the
          username that can access the blockstore database.

      * - :guilabel:`Encrypted Credentials` (Optional)

        - Select if the Username and Password for the database were encrypted
          using the ``credentialstool``. For details on the
          ``credentialstool``, see :ref:`encrypt-mongodb-user-credentials`.

      * - :guilabel:`Use TLS/SSL` (Optional)

        - Select if the blockstore database only accepts connection
          encrypted using TLS.

          To enable TLS on the blockstore database, see 
          :manual:`Configure mongod and mongos for TLS/SSL </tutorial/configure-ssl>`.

      * - :guilabel:`Connection Options` (Optional)

        - Type any additional :manual:`configuration file options </reference/configuration-options>`
          for the MongoDB instance. This field supports unescaped values only.

      * - :guilabel:`Assignment Labels` (Optional)

        - Type a comma-separated list of labels to assign the
          blockstores to specific groups.

      * - :guilabel:`Blockstore Max Capacity (GB)` (Optional)

        - Type a maximum size for a blockstore.

      * - :guilabel:`Load Factor` (Optional)

        - Type what proportion of backup work you want this snapshot
          store to handle. Backup work includes running backups,
          restoring snapshots or :term:`grooming <groom>` blockstores.
          The proportion of backup work assigned to a single snapshot
          store is called its *Load Factor*.

          .. important::
             Only set a :guilabel:`Load Factor` if you are managing the
             backups for a sharded cluster across more than one
             snapshot store. If you do not have more than one snapshot
             store, skip this setting.

          By default, |mms| assigns snapshot stores a :guilabel:`Load
          Factor` of ``1``. This means the backup workload would be
          split evenly between all snapshot stores.

          Snapshot stores with greater compute or storage performance
          should be given a greater :guilabel:`Load Factor`:

          - A file system store with 16-cores and 128 GB or RAM can
            back up more databases in less time.

          - A blockstore backed by a 10-node sharded cluster can back
            up more databases and groom more databases than a
            blockstore backed by a single replica set.

          .. example:: **How the Load Factor affects backup work**

             You are backing up a five-shard cluster. Your backup
             storage configuration has:
             
             - File system store (``A``) running on a two-core server
               supporting one shard and

             - Blockstore (``B``) running on four shard cluster across four
               servers with eight cores each supporting a total of four
               shards.

             ``B`` is four times larger than ``A``. ``B`` should get a
             Load Factor of ``4``. ``A`` should get a Load Factor
             of ``1``.

      * - :guilabel:`Write Concern`

        - Select your preferred :manual:`Write Concern</core/write-concern/>`:

          - Default
          - Journaled
          - Acknowledged
          - Replica Acknowledged
          - Majority

  Select if you want to assign backup jobs to this blockstore immediately
  after it has been created. By default, the blockstore can be assigned backup
  jobs. If you clear this checkbox, the blockstore is created but you cannot
