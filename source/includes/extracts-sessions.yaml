   Starting in 3.6, MongoDB drivers associate all operations with a server
   session, with the exception of unacknowledged writes. The following
   options are available for all commands to support association with a
   server session:

   .. important::
      
      The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and the drivers assign these options
      to the commands in the session.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 15 50

      * - Option
        - Type
        - Description

      * - ``lsid``
        - Document

        - The document that specifies the unique id of the session
          associated with the command. If the ``txnNumber`` is
          specified, the ``lsid`` is required.

      * - ``txnNumber``

        - 64-bit integer

        - A strictly increasing non-negative number that uniquely
          identifies the command in the command's session.

          If specified, the command must also include the ``lsid``
          option.

   For the :dbcommand:`delete`, :dbcommand:`insert`, and :dbcommand:`update`
   commands that take an array of statements, the following option is also
   available:

   .. important::

      Do not manually set ``stmtIds``. MongoDB sets the ``stmtIds``
      to be strictly increasing non-negative numbers.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 15 15 50

      * - Option
        - Type
        - Description

      * - ``stmtIds``

        - Array of 32-bit integers

        - Array of numbers that uniquely identify their respective
          write operations within the write command.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6.3
