You can configure the |charts| web server to use the HTTPS
protocol, as opposed to the default HTTP protocol. With the HTTPS
protocol, the web server encrypts your data using
:abbr:`SSL (Secure Socket Layer)`, which ensures that the host
transmits data securely.

This process differs from :doc:`configuring SSL for data sources
</administration/configure-ssl-data-sources>`, because this process
enables |tls-ssl| on the |charts-short| web server itself, rather than
configuring a connection to a specific MongoDB deployment with TLS/SSL
enabled. When HTTPS is configured, |charts-short| uses the standard
HTTPS port ``443`` by default, and the |charts-short| web server
redirects any requests over HTTP (port 80) to the equivalent HTTPS
port.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can configure HTTPS for your |charts| web server, you must
first obtain an SSL key and certificate from an appropriate
certification authority. Instructions for obtaining an SSL key and
providing a list of trusted certificate authorities are out of scope
for this tutorial.

Procedure
