"The :term:`oplog` exists internally as a :term:`capped collection`, so "
"you cannot modify its size in the course of normal operations. In most "
"cases the :ref:`default oplog size <replica-set-oplog-sizing>` is an "
"acceptable size; however, in some situations you may need a larger or "
"smaller oplog. For example, you might need to change the oplog size if "
"your applications perform large numbers of multi-updates or deletes in "
"short periods of time."
