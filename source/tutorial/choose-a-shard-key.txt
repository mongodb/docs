Choosing a Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For many collections there may be no single, naturally occurring key
that possesses all the qualities of a good shard key. The following
strategies may help construct a useful shard key from existing data:

#. Compute a more ideal shard key in your application layer,
   and store this in all of your documents, potentially in the
   ``_id`` field.

#. Use a compound shard key that uses two or three values from all
   documents that provide the right mix of cardinality with scalable
   write operations and query isolation.

#. Determine that the impact of using a less than ideal shard key
   is insignificant in your use case, given:

   - limited write volume,
   - expected data size, or
   - application query patterns.

#. .. versionadded:: 2.4
      Use a :term:`hashed shard key`. Choose a field that has high
      cardinality and create a :ref:`hashed index <index-hashed-index>`
      on that field. MongoDB uses these hashed index values as shard key
      values, which ensures an even distribution of documents across the
      shards.

Considerations for Selecting Shard Key
--------------------------------------

Choosing the correct shard key can have a great impact on the
performance, capability, and functioning of your database and cluster.
Appropriate shard key choice depends on the schema of your data and the
way that your applications query and write data.

Create a Shard Key that is Easily Divisible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An easily divisible shard key makes it easy for MongoDB to distribute
content among the shards. Shard keys that have a limited number of
possible values can result in chunks that are "unsplittable."

.. seealso:: :ref:`sharding-shard-key-cardinality`

Create a Shard Key that has High Degree of Randomness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A shard key with high degree of randomness prevents any single shard
from becoming a bottleneck and will distribute write operations among
the cluster.

.. seealso:: :ref:`sharding-shard-key-write-scaling`

Create a Shard Key that Targets a Single Shard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A shard key that targets a single shard makes it possible for the
:program:`mongos` program to return most query operations directly
from a single *specific* :program:`mongod` instance. Your shard key
should be the primary field used by your queries. Fields with a high
degree of "randomness" make it difficult to target operations to
specific shards.

.. seealso:: :ref:`sharding-shard-key-query-isolation`

Shard Using a Compound Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The challenge when selecting a shard key is that there is not always
an obvious choice. Often, an existing field in your collection may not
be the optimal key. In those situations, computing a special purpose
shard key into an additional field or using a compound shard key may
help produce one that is more ideal.

Cardinality
~~~~~~~~~~~

Cardinality in the context of MongoDB, refers to the ability of the
system to :term:`partition` data into :term:`chunks <chunk>`. For
example, consider a collection of data such as an "address book" that
stores address records:

- Consider the use of a ``state`` field as a shard key:

  The state key's value holds the US state for a given address document.
  This field has a *low cardinality* as all documents that have the
  same value in the ``state`` field *must* reside on the same shard,
  even if a particular state's chunk exceeds the maximum chunk size.

  Since there are a limited number of possible values for the ``state``
  field, MongoDB may distribute data unevenly among a small
  number of fixed chunks. This may have a number of effects:

  - If MongoDB cannot split a chunk because all of its documents
    have the same shard key, migrations involving these un-splittable
    chunks will take longer than other migrations, and it will be more
    difficult for your data to stay balanced.

  - If you have a fixed maximum number of chunks, you will never be
    able to use more than that number of shards for this collection.

- Consider the use of a ``zipcode`` field as a shard key:

  While this field has a large number of possible values, and thus has
  potentially higher cardinality, it's possible that a large number of users
  could have the same value for the shard key, which would make this
  chunk of users un-splittable.

  In these cases, cardinality depends on the data. If your address book
  stores records for a geographically distributed contact list
  (e.g. "Dry cleaning businesses in America,") then a value like
  zipcode would be sufficient. However, if your address book is
  more geographically concentrated (e.g "ice cream stores in Boston
  Massachusetts,") then you may have a much lower cardinality.

- Consider the use of a ``phone-number`` field as a shard key:

  Phone number has a *high cardinality,* because users will generally
  have a unique value for this field, MongoDB will be able to split as
  many chunks as needed.

While "high cardinality," is necessary for ensuring an even
distribution of data, having a high cardinality does not guarantee
sufficient :ref:`query isolation <sharding-shard-key-query-isolation>`
or appropriate :ref:`write scaling <sharding-shard-key-write-scaling>`.
