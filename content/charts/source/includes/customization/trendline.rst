You can add a trendline to a continuous line/area or scatter chart. To
enable the trendline feature: 

1. Open the :ref:`Customize <customize-charts>` pane for your chart.
#. Scroll down to the :guilabel:`Chart Elements` section.
#. Toggle the :guilabel:`Trendline` switch.
#. Select a series from the :guilabel:`Series` dropdown menu.
#. Select a trendline type from the :guilabel:`Type` dropdown menu.

Trendlines span the entire length of a chart's X axis, including any
additional space added as a result of a :ref:`min/max axis customization
<max-min-options>`.

The following trendline types are available:

- Linear (default)
- Logarithmic
- Quadratic
- Cubic
- Exponential
- Power

The trendline option is not available if:

- A field is mapped to the :ref:`series <multi-series-charts>` channel.
- A :ref:`count by value aggregation <count-by-value-agg>` is used.
