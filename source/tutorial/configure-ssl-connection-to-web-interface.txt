Overview
--------

You can encrypt connections from the Monitoring and Backup Agents to
|mms|, from website clients to the |mms| ``Admin`` interface,
and from command-line clients, such as curl, to the REST API. You can
encrypt connections in the following ways:

- Set up an HTTPS proxy in front of |mms|.

- Run the |application| over HTTPS, as described here.
 
The following procedure configures |mms| with a .pem file that contains
the |mms| host's certificate and private key. If you are using automation,
the Automation Agent automatically updates the Monitoring and Backup agents
for HTTPS after successfully completing the procedure. If you are not using
automation, you must manually configure all of the agents using the same
procedure. By default, |mms| uses port ``8443`` for HTTPS access.

Run the |application| Over HTTPS
