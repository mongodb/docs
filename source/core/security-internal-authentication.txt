Internal Authentication
=======================

You can authenticate members of :term:`replica sets <replica set>` and
:term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`. For the internal authentication of
the members, MongoDB can use either keyfiles or :ref:`x.509 <security-auth-x509>`
certificates.

The selected method is used for all internal communication. For example, when a
client authenticates to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` using one of the supported
:ref:`authentication mechanisms <security-authentication-mechanisms>`,
the ``mongos`` then uses the configured internal authentication method to
connect to the required :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes.

.. note::

   Enabling internal authentication also enables :doc:`client
   authorization </core/authorization>`.

.. _internal-auth-keyfile:

Keyfiles
--------

Keyfiles use :doc:`/core/security-scram` challenge and response
authentication mechanism. The contents of the keyfiles serve as the
shared password for the members. A key's length must be between 6 and
1024 characters and may only contain characters in the base64 set.

MongoDB strips whitespace characters (e.g. ``x0d``, ``x09``, and ``x20``)
for cross-platform convenience. As a result, the following operations
produce identical keys:

.. code-block:: sh

   echo -e "my secret key" > key1
   echo -e "my secret key\n" > key2
   echo -e "my    secret    key" > key3
   echo -e "my\r\nsecret\r\nkey\r\n" > key4

.. include:: /includes/extracts/keyfile-file-permission.rst

The content of the keyfile must be the same on all :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances that connect to each other. You must store the
keyfile on each member of the replica set or sharded clusters.

To specify the keyfile, use the :setting:`security.keyFile` setting or
``--keyFile`` command line option.

For an example of keyfile internal authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/enforce-keyfile-access-control-in-existing-replica-set`.

.. _internal-auth-x509:

x.509
-----

Members of a replica set or sharded cluster can use x.509 certificates for
internal authentication instead of using keyfiles. MongoDB supports x.509
certificate authentication for use with a secure TLS/SSL connection.
