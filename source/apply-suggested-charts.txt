Overview 
--------

MongoDB Charts displays up to six prebuilt charts based on the data
source that you selected. You can use any one of the suggested charts
when you create a new chart or when you modify an existing chart. After
applying a suggested chart, you can make changes to the chart type and
add or remove fields if you wish to customize the prebuilt chart.
