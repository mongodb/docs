   In the aggregation pipeline pane in the bottom-left of the view,

   Fill in your selected stage. As you modify the pipeline stage, the
   preview documents shown in the pane to the right of the stage
   update automatically to reflect the results of your pipeline as it
   progresses, provided :guilabel:`Auto Preview` is enabled:

   Add additional aggregation stages as desired by clicking the
   :guilabel:`Add Stage` button below your last aggregation stage.
   Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each additional stage.

   .. note::

      The toggle to the right of the name of each pipeline stage
      dictates whether that stage is included in the pipeline. Toggling
      a pipeline stage also updates the pipeline preview, which reflects
      whether or not that stage is included.

      .. example::

         The following pipeline excludes the first
         :manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage
         and only includes the
         :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project/>`
         stage:
