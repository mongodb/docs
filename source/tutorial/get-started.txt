.. default-domain:: mongodb

|onprem| is a web application that lets you create, manage, monitor and back up
MongoDB deployments. The web application and two HTTP-based services are 
installed on the Ops Manager server and software agents are installed in each 
server running MongoDB.

You can use |onprem| to create new deployments and monitor existing ones. To 
monitor existing deployments, you need to download an |onprem| agent to each 
server in the MongoDB deployment.

|onprem| walks you through adding existing MongoDB deployments to monitor.
The choices you make during setup do not limit your choices for the future.
