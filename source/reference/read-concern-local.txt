   :description: Using read concern local returns data with no guarantee that the data has been written to a majority of the replica set members (i.e. may be rolled back). It is the default for read operations against the primary.

A query with read concern ``"local"`` returns data from the instance
with no guarantee that the data has been written to a majority of the
replica set members (i.e. may be rolled back).

Read concern ``"local"`` is the default for:

- read operations against primary

- read operations against secondaries if the reads are associated with
  :ref:`causally consistent sessions <sessions>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-readConcern-most-recent-data-in-node.rst

Availability
-------------

Read concern :readconcern:`local` is available for use with or without
causally consistent sessions and transactions.

Read Concern ``"local"`` and Transactions
-----------------------------------------

You set the read concern at the transaction level, not at the
individual operation level. To set the read concern for transactions,
see :ref:`transactions-read-concern`.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-create-collections-read-concern.rst

Example
-------

.. include:: /includes/fact-read-concern-write-timeline.rst

Then, the following tables summarizes the state of the data that a read
operation with :readconcern:`"local"` read concern would see at
time ``T``.
