.. important:: Don't Use API Keys in User-Facing Clients
   
   If you're authenticating from a browser or another user-facing client application,
   avoid using an API key to log in. Instead, use another authentication
   provider that takes user-provided credentials. Never store API keys or other
   sensitive credentials locally.
