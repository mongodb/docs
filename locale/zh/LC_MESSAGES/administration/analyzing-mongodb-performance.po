"As you develop and operate applications with MongoDB, you may need to "
"analyze the performance of the application and its database. When you "
"encounter degraded performance, it is often a function of database access "
"strategies, hardware availability, and the number of open database "
"connections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some users may experience performance limitations as a result of inadequate "
"or inappropriate indexing strategies, or as a consequence of poor schema "

"impact MongoDB's internal locking."

"Performance issues may indicate that the database is operating at capacity "
"and that it is time to add additional capacity to the database. In "

"information on the working set."

"With the :ref:`MMAPv1 <storage-mmapv1>` storage engine, MongoDB uses memory-"

msgid "Page Faults"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/includes/fact-page-fault.rst:1
msgid ""
"With the MMAPv1 storage engine, page faults can occur as MongoDB reads from "
"or writes data to parts of its data files that are not currently located in "
"physical memory. In contrast, operating system page faults happen when "
"physical memory is exhausted and pages of physical memory are swapped to "
"disk."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance.txt:115
msgid ""
"Rapid increases in the MongoDB page fault counter may indicate that the "
"server has too little physical memory. Page faults also can occur while "
"accessing large data sets or scanning an entire collection."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance.txt:119
msgid ""
"A single page fault completes quickly and is not problematic. However, in "
"aggregate, large volumes of page faults typically indicate that MongoDB is "
"reading too much data from disk."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance.txt:123
msgid ""
"MongoDB can often \"yield\" read locks after a page fault, allowing other "
"database processes to read while :program:`mongod` loads the next page into "
"memory. Yielding the read lock following a page fault improves concurrency, "
"and also improves overall throughput in high volume systems."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/administration/analyzing-mongodb-performance.txt:128
msgid ""
"Increasing the amount of RAM accessible to MongoDB may help reduce the "
"frequency of page faults. If this is not possible, you may want to consider "
"deploying a :term:`sharded cluster` or adding :term:`shards <shard>` to your"
" deployment to distribute load among :program:`mongod` instances."

"Spikes in the number of connections can also be the result of application or"
" driver errors. All of the officially supported MongoDB drivers implement "
"connection pooling, which allows clients to use and reuse connections more "
"efficiently. Extremely high numbers of connections, particularly without "
"corresponding workload is often indicative of a driver or other "
"configuration error."
