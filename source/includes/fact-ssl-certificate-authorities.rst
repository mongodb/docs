For production use, your MongoDB deployment should use valid certificates
generated and signed by a single certificate authority. You or your
organization can generate and maintain an independent certificate
authority, or use certificates generated by a third-party TLS/SSL
vendor. Obtaining and managing certificates is beyond the scope of
this documentation.
