Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to create an application that uses the
{+driver-long+} to connect to a MongoDB cluster hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
The {+driver-short+} is a library of functions that you can use to connect
to and communicate with MongoDB.

.. tip::

   MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your
   MongoDB deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card
   required) MongoDB Atlas deployment by following the steps in this guide.

Follow the steps in this guide to connect a sample Node.js application to
a MongoDB Atlas deployment. If you prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different
driver or programming language, see our :driver:`list of official drivers <>`.

Download and Install
--------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Install dependencies

      Ensure you have the following dependencies installed in 
      your development environment:
      
      - Node.js {+min-node-version+} or later 
      - npm (Node Package Manager)

      To learn how to install Node.js and npm, see
      `Downloading and installing Node.js and npm <https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm>`__
      in the npm documentation.

   .. step:: Create a project directory

      In your shell, run the following command to create a 
      directory called ``node_quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir node_quickstart

      Then, run the following commands to navigate into the 
      directory and initialize your Node.js project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd node_quickstart
         npm init -y
      
      When the initialization command successfully completes, you have a ``package.json`` 
      file in your ``node_quickstart`` directory.

   .. step:: Install the Node.js Driver

      Run the following command from your project directory to install
      the driver:

      .. code-block:: bash

         npm install mongodb@{+version+}

      This command performs the following actions:

      - Downloads the ``mongodb`` package and the dependencies it requires
      - Saves the package in the ``node_modules`` directory
      - Records the dependency information in the ``package.json`` file

After you complete these steps, you have a new project directory with
the driver dependencies installed.

Create a MongoDB Deployment
---------------------------

You can create a free tier MongoDB deployment on MongoDB Atlas
to store and manage your data. MongoDB Atlas hosts and manages
your MongoDB database in the cloud.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create a free MongoDB deployment on Atlas

      Complete the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started?tck=docs_driver_nodejs>`
      guide to set up a new Atlas account and load sample data into a new free
      tier MongoDB deployment.
      
   .. step:: Save your credentials

      After you create your database user, save that user's 
      username and password to a safe location for use in an upcoming step.
  
After you complete these steps, you have a new free tier MongoDB
deployment on Atlas, database user credentials, and sample data loaded
in your database.

.. _node-quick-start-connection-string:
.. _node-get-started-connection-string:

Create a Connection String
--------------------------

You can connect to your MongoDB deployment by providing a
**connection URI**, also called a *connection string*, which
instructs the driver on how to connect to a MongoDB deployment
and how to behave while connected.

The connection string includes the hostname or IP address and 
port of your deployment, the authentication mechanism, user credentials 
when applicable, and connection options.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Find your MongoDB Atlas connection string

      To retrieve your connection string for the deployment that
      you created in the :ref:`previous section <node-get-started-create-deployment>`,
      log into your Atlas account and navigate to the
      :guilabel:`Clusters` section and click the :guilabel:`Connect` button
      for your new deployment.

      .. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas_connection_connect_cluster.png
         :alt: The connect button in the clusters section of the Atlas UI

   .. step:: Copy your connection string

      Click the button on the right of the connection string to copy it to
      your clipboard, as shown in the following screenshot:

      .. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas_connection_copy_uri_node.png
         :alt: The connection string copy button in the Atlas UI

   .. step:: Update the placeholders

      Paste your connection string into a file in your preferred text editor
      and replace the ``username`` and ``<db_password>`` placeholders with your
      database user's username and password.

      Save this file to a safe location for use in the next section.

After completing these steps, you have a connection string that
contains your database username and password.

Connect to MongoDB
------------------

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create your Node.js application

      In your ``node_quickstart`` directory, create a file called
      ``index.js`` for your application.
      
      Copy and paste the following code into the ``index.js`` file:
      
      .. code-block:: js

         const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");

         // Replace the uri string with your connection string
         const uri = "<connection string uri>";

         const client = new MongoClient(uri);

         async function run() {
           try {
             const database = client.db('sample_mflix');
             const movies = database.collection('movies');

             // Queries for a movie that has a title value of 'Back to the Future'
             const query = { title: 'Back to the Future' };
             const movie = await movies.findOne(query);

             console.log(movie);
           } finally {
             await client.close();
           }
         }
         run().catch(console.dir);

   .. step:: Assign the connection string

      Replace the ``<connection string uri>`` placeholder with the 
      connection string that you copied from the :ref:`node-quick-start-connection-string`
      step of this guide.

   .. step:: Run your Node.js application

      From your project directory, run the following command to start
      the application:
      
      .. code-block:: none

         node index.js

      The output includes details about the retrieved movie document:

      .. code-block:: none

         {
           _id: ...,
           plot: 'A young man is accidentally sent 30 years into the past...',
           genres: [ 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi' ],
           ...
           title: 'Back to the Future',
           ...
         }

      If you encounter an error or see no output, verify that you specified the
      proper connection string in the ``index.js`` file and that you loaded the
      sample data.

After you complete these steps, you have a working application that
uses the driver to connect to your MongoDB deployment, query
the sample data, and print out the result.
