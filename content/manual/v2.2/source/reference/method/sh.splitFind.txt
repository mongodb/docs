.. method:: sh.splitFind(namespace, query)

   :param string namespace: Specify the namespace
                            (i.e. "``<database>.<collection>``") of
                            the sharded collection that contains the
                            chunk to split.

   :param query: Specify a query to identify a document in a specific
                 chunk. Typically specify the :term:`shard key` for a
                 document as the query.

   Splits the chunk containing the document specified by the ``query``
   at its median point, creating two roughly equal chunks. Use
   :method:`sh.splitAt()` to split a collection in a specific point.

   In most circumstances, you should leave chunk splitting to the
   automated processes. However, when initially deploying a
   :term:`sharded cluster` it is necessary to perform some measure of
   :term:`pre-splitting` using manual methods including
   :method:`sh.splitFind()`.
