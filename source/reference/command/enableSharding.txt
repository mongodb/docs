Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: enableSharding

   .. note::

      .. versionchanged:: 6.0

      Starting in MongoDB 6.0, this command is **not** required to
      :ref:`shard <sharding-background>` a collection.

   The :dbcommand:`enableSharding` command explicitly creates a database.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`sh.enableSharding` 
      helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-no-serverless.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

- *Recommended*.  Specify the database to create:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.adminCommand( 
        { 
          enableSharding: "<database name>"
        } 
     )

- Optionally, you can include the primary shard specification in the command, 
  although this is not recommended:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.adminCommand( 
        { 
          enableSharding: "<database name>",
          primaryShard: "<shard name>"  
        } 
     )

You can only run the :dbcommand:`enableSharding` command on the ``admin`` database
from a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - :ref:`enableSharding <cmd-enableSharding-db>`
     - String
     - .. _cmd-enableSharding-db:

       The database you want to use.  The database is created if it
       does not exist.

   * - :ref:`primaryShard <cmd-enableSharding-primaryShard>`
     - String
     - .. _cmd-enableSharding-primaryShard:

       Optional. The :ref:`primary shard <primary-shard>` for the
       database; the primary shard contains the unsharded collection
       for this database. In general, rather than explicitly specifying
       the primary shard, it is recommended to let the balancer select
       the primary shard instead.

       .. warning:: Tip


          In general, you should not need to specify the primary shard. Allow
          the balancer to select the primary shard instead.

Returns
~~~~~~~

The command returns a document that contains status of the operation.

Primary Shard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, you should not need to specify the :ref:`primaryShard
<cmd-enableSharding-primaryShard>` in the command. Instead, allow the
balancer to select the primary shard. 

However, if you do specify the :ref:`primaryShard
<cmd-enableSharding-primaryShard>` in the command for a :ref:`database
<cmd-enableSharding-db>` and the database is already sharding enabled
with a different primary shard, the operation returns an error and the
primary shard for the database remains as before. To change the primary
shard for a database, use :dbcommand:`movePrimary` instead.

Example
-------

The following command, run from a :binary:`~bin.mongos`, creates the 
the ``shardTest`` database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { enableSharding: "shardTest" } )
