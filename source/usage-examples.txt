Overview
--------

Usage examples show runnable code examples to demonstrate frequently used MongoDB
operations. Each usage example includes the following:

- Description of the MongoDB operation
- Asynchronous and synchronous Rust code examples that you can run in
  your environment
- Output printed by the code example

.. tip:: Asynchronous and Synchronous APIs
   
   To learn more about selecting and using different runtime APIs in the
   {+driver-short+}, see the :ref:`rust-runtimes` guide.

How to Use the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

The usage examples are designed to run operations on a MongoDB deployment that contains
the Atlas sample datasets. When you run the example code without the sample data, the output
might not match. 

Follow this tutorial to set up your MongoDB deployment with the sample data and run the
example code in your development environment. Before performing the following actions,
ensure that you create an Atlas account and deploy a cluster. For information about setting
up an account and a cluster, see the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas Guide
</getting-started/#atlas-getting-started>`.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Load the Sample Datasets
      
      Follow the instructions on the :atlas:`Load Sample Data </sample-data>` page
      to load the sample datasets into your database deployment.

   .. step:: Add the Usage Example Code to Your Development Environment

      Copy the example code from the usage example page and paste it into a new file in
      your preferred directory.
      
      To learn more about creating an application that uses the {+driver-short+}, follow the
      :ref:`rust-quickstart`.

   .. step:: Replace the Connection String Placeholder

      In your example code, replace the ``connection string`` placeholder with your MongoDB
      deployment connection string. For example, if your connection string is
      ``"mongodb+srv://mongodb-example:27017"``, your connection string assignment resembles
      the following:

      .. code-block:: rust
         :copyable: false

         let uri = "mongodb+srv://mongodb-example:27017";

   .. step:: Run the Usage Example Code

      Run your application in your development environment. If you run your Rust applications
      on the command line, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cargo run

After completing these steps, you can see the output described in the **Expected Output** section
of the corresponding usage example.
