Manual Organization
===================

This document provides an overview of the global organization of the
documentation resource. Refer to the notes below if you are having
trouble understanding the reasoning behind a file's current location,
or if you want to add new documentation but aren't sure how to
integrate it into the existing resource.

If you have questions, don't hesitate to open a ticket in the
`Documentation Jira Project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DOCS>`_
or contact the `documentation team <mailto:docs@mongodb.com>`__.

Global Organization
-------------------

Indexes and Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The documentation project has two "index files": ``/contents.txt`` and
``/index.txt``. The "contents" file
provides the documentation's tree structure, which Sphinx uses
to create the left-pane navigational structure, to power the "Next" and
"Previous" page functionality, and to provide all overarching outlines of the
resource. The "index" file is not included in the "contents" file (and
thus builds will produce a warning here) and is the page that users
first land on when visiting the resource.

Having separate "contents" and "index" files provides a bit more
flexibility with the organization of the resource while also making it
possible to customize the primary user experience.

Topical Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The placement of files in the repository depends on the *type* of
documentation rather than the *topic* of the content. Like the
difference between ``contents.txt`` and ``index.txt``, by decoupling
the organization of the files from the organization of the information
the documentation can be more flexible and can more adequately address
changes in the product and in users' needs.

*Files* in the ``source/`` directory represent the tip of a logical
tree of documents, while *directories* are containers of types of
content. The ``administration`` and ``applications`` directories,
however, are legacy artifacts and with a few exceptions contain
sub-navigation pages.

With several exceptions in the ``reference/`` directory, there is only
one level of sub-directories in the ``source/`` directory.

Tools
-----

The organization of the site, like all Sphinx sites derives from the
``toctree`` structure. However, in order to annotate
the table of contents and provide additional flexibility, the MongoDB
documentation generates ``toctree`` structures using
data from YAML files stored in the ``source/includes/``
directory. These files start with ``ref-toc`` or ``toc`` and generate
output in the ``source/includes/toc/`` directory. Briefly this system
has the following behavior:

- files that start with ``ref-toc`` refer to the documentation of API
  objects (i.e. commands, operators and methods), and the build
  system generates files that hold ``toctree``
  directives as well as files that hold *tables* that list objects and
  a brief description.

- files that start with ``toc`` refer to all other documentation and
  the build system generates files that hold ``toctree``  directives as 
  well as files that hold *definition lists* that contain links to the 
  documents and short descriptions the content.

- file names that have ``spec`` following ``toc`` or ``ref-toc`` will
  generate aggregated tables or definition lists and allow ad-hoc
  combinations of documents for landing pages and quick reference guides.
