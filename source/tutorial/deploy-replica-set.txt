====================
Deploy a Replica Set
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MMS lets you deploy and monitor :term:`replica sets <replica set>`.
Replica sets synchronize data across multiple servers to provide
redundancy and high availability. For details on replica sets, see the
:manual:`Repication Introduction /core/replication-introduction` in the
MongoDB manual.

This tutorial describes how to deploy a replica set that is managed by
MMS. After deploying a replica set, you can use MMS to add members and
perform other management operations on the set.
