title: Create an external service for {{podType}}.
content: |
  To connect to your {{k8sResource}} from an external resource, configure the 
  :ref:`spec.externalAccess <multi-spec-externalaccess>` setting:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     externalAccess: {}

  This setting instructs the |k8s-op-short| to create an external :k8sdocs:`LoadBalancer 
  </concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer>` service for {{podType}} in your 
  {{k8sResource}}. The external service provides an entry point for external connections.
  Adding this setting with no values creates an external service with the following default
  values:

  .. include:: /includes/list-tables/external-service-default.rst

  Optionally, if you need to add values to the service or override the default values,
  specify:

  - Annotations specific to your cloud provider, in {{annotations}}
  
  - Overrides for the service specification, in {{overrides}}.

  For example, the following settings override the default values for the external service 
  to configure your {{k8sResource}} to create :k8sdocs:`NodePort services 
  </concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport>` that expose {{podType}}:
  
  .. code-block:: yaml

    externalAccess:
      externalService: 
        annotations:
          # cloud-specific annotations for the service
        spec:
          type: NodePort # default is LoadBalancer
          port: 27017
          # you can specify other spec overrides if necessary

  .. tip:: 

    To learn more, see |k8s-annotations|
    and :k8sdocs:`ServiceSpec </reference/kubernetes-api/service-resources/service-v1/#ServiceSpec>` 
    in the |k8s| documentation.

  podType: "the pod"
  k8sResource: "resource"

  In {{deployment}}, run the following command to verify that the 
  |k8s-op-short| created the external service for your deployment.

  .. code-block:: sh

     $ kubectl get services

  The command returns a list of services similar to the following output.
  For each database Pod in the cluster, the |k8s-op-short| creates an external service 
  named {{format}}. This service is configured according to the values 
  and overrides you provide in the {{spec}}.

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     NAME                                  TYPE         CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)           AGE
     {{example}}   LoadBalancer   10.102.27.116    <lb-ip-or-fqdn>   27017:27017/TCP    8m30s
    
  Depending on your cluster configuration or cloud provider, 
  the IP address of the LoadBalancer service is an externally 
  accessible IP address or |fqdn|. You can use the IP address or |fqdn| 
  to route traffic from your external domain.

  deployment: "your deployment"

  To connect to your deployment from outside of the |k8s| cluster, 
  use the MongoDB Shell (``mongosh``) and specify the {{podType}} 
  that you've exposed through the external domain. 

  .. example::

     If you have {{addressExample}}, you can
     connect to this sharded cluster instance from outside of the |k8s|
     cluster by using the following command:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongosh "{{addressCommand}}"

replacement:
  podType: "pod"
  k8sResource: "resource"
  addressExample: ""
  addressCommand: ""
