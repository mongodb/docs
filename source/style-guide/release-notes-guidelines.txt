Release Notes Guidelines
========================

.. include:: /style-guide/includes/page-needs-update.rst

This topic provides guidelines for writing release notes (RN) for
MongoDB Cloud services APIs.

A template for API RN is available in `on
GitHub <https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-repo-template/blob/master/api-guide-template/release-notes/releases/release-notes-template.rst>`__.

For an example that illustrates most of these guidelines, see the
:opsmgr:`Ops Manager Server Release Notes </release-notes/application/>`.

Structure
---------

Initial Major Version Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each major version-specific release note file that you create,
observe the following guidelines:

-  Use one of the following formats for the title of the release note:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 50 50
      :header-rows: 1


      * - Format
        - Example

      * - If the release has a version number, use that in the title.
        -
          .. code-block:: rst

             .. _opsmgr-server-4.0.13:

             |onprem| Server 4.0.13
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

             *Released on 2019-07-04*

             - Removing whitelist from Admin (General > Users) now possible.
               Displays error message when Authentication expires

             - **Agent Upgrades:** :ref:`automation-5.4.20.5541`,
               :ref:`backup-6.8.7.1024`

      * - If the release does not have a version number, use the API
          contract version and date.
        - **API | contract version | updates, January 07, 2017**

      * - If you are documenting a named or initial release, indicate
          the initial release in the title.

          You can precede release with a type, such as EA or UA.
        - **API |contract version | release, September 14, 2017**

          **API |contract version | EA release, September 14, 2017**

-  Use the following main sections in the release notes:

   -  What's new

   -  Resolved issues

   -  Known issues

   -  Documentation changes

   .. note::

      Anything previously labeled as "enhancements" can be included
      either in "What's new" or "Resolved issues" as appropriate.


-  Include the "What's new," "Resolved issues," and "Known issues"
   sections in every RN file, even if you have no content for one of
   those sections. If one of these sections has no content for a
   release, use the \|no changes\| variable for the body text. This
   variable inserts the boilerplate text "None for this release." For
   example:

   .. code-block:: rst

      Known issues
      ````````````

      ``|no changes|``

-  Include the "Documentation changes" section only if you have
   significant content changes, such as adding an extended example, a
   tutorial, or new content. If you have no significant content changes
   for a release, omit that section entirely.


-  Order your RN files from latest to earliest, so that the latest is
   always "on top." For example, the release notes for version 1.1
   should precede the release notes for version 1.0 in the hierarchy.

Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Use sentence-style capitalization for all headings, including the
   title of the file (see the examples in the preceding section). The
   only exception to this rule is the high-level title of the release
   notes section, which is **Release Notes**.

-  If a section has several items, for example there are several
   resolved issues to document, provide the descriptions in a bullet
   list. You do not need to precede the bullet list with an introductory
   sentence, unless one is necessary for clarity.

-  If you have only one item to document in a section, do not show it
   as a bullet item. Show it as regular text.

-  Use the punctuation guidelines for lists at
   :ref:`writing-list-items`.

-  As needed, use the guidelines at :ref:`text-formatting`.

Wording
~~~~~~~

You do not need to include an introductory paragraph for each file. The
one that exists for the "Release Notes" section as a whole is
sufficient. You can begin each file with the "What's new" heading.
However, you can include an introductory paragraph if necessary—for
example, if you want to state that the release notes correspond to a
particular type of release, such as a Limited Availability release, or
you need to introduce the first release of a major version.

If you refer to content in another part of the API document, provide a
link to the specific section.

Use the following guideline when creating items in each section:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 40 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Section
     - Guideline
     - Examples

   * - What's new
     - Use sentences to describe the new feature or enhancement.
       Provide as needed, and provide a link to any section in the
       documentation that describes that feature.
     - IPv6 support has been added. When you create a server, an IPv4
       address and an IPv6 address block are assigned. The IPv4 address and
       IPv6 address block are used for the public interface (Internet). The
       IPv4 address is also used for the private interface.

   * - Resolved issues
     - Provide an initial phrase that describes the issue that was
       fixed. Start the phrase with a past-tense verb. If necessary,
       include sentences to further explain the fix. If you list only
       phrases, do not use ending punctuation.
     - Added support for Debian 8 (Jessie)

       Trimmed the Monitoring ID and Monitoring Token configuration
       variables to ensure correctness

       Fixed the Xen Server 6 package repo

   * - Known issues
     - Use sentences to describe the issue. If a workaround is
       available, explain it.
     - The create a service operation does not support Classless
       Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) for IP address restrictions.

   * - Documentation changes
     - Provide an initial phrase that describes the issue that was
       fixed. Start the phrase with a past-tense verb. If necessary,
       include sentences to further explain the fix. If you list only
       phrases, do not use ending punctuation. Provide a link to the
       relevant section in the documentation.
     - Clarified the descriptions of the alert policies to include how
       the polling window affects the alarm state.

Editing Existing Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In cases where existing release notes were not accurate at the time of
publication, change the content to make it accurate. You can make the
following types of changes:

-  Fix typos
-  Correct links that were wrong at the time of publication
-  Correct incorrect statements to reflect what was correct at the time
   of publication
