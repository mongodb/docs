====================
Create a New Cluster
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

Basically, the same as getting started (we can single-source).

Explanation of stuff you select.

Probably blurb that state that you have the ability to change xyz after
you have created the cluster and a blurb about what you cannot change.

.. important:: stuff about password
