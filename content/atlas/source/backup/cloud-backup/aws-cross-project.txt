|service| provides efficient cross-project restores for 
{+database-deployments+} that have {+gcp+} and {+azure+} nodes. If you 
have {+database-deployments+} with {+aws+} nodes created before 
March 27, 2024, you can enable faster cross-project restores.
|service| automatically provides efficient cross-project restores for 
{+database-deployments+} with {+aws+} nodes created after March 
27, 2024.

Considerations
--------------

- The :guilabel:`Faster Restore` button appears only for 
  |service| {+database-deployments+} with {+aws+} nodes created before 
  March 27, 2024. This button doesn't appear for 
  :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas for Government </government>` 
  {+database-deployments+}.

- When you enable faster cross-project restores, |service| replaces each 
  node in the {+database-deployments+}. These replacements might span multiple 
  maintenance windows if |service| requires more time to process these replacements 
  within a given window. 

- Secondary reads and analytic nodes are unavailable during this 
  change.

- When the replacement completes, |service| sends an email confirmation.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-backup-page.rst

   .. step:: Enable faster cross-project restores.

      a. Click the :guilabel:`Faster Restore` button.

         .. note::

            If the :guilabel:`Faster Restore` button is missing or 
            disabled, you already have faster cross-project restores 
            enabled.
