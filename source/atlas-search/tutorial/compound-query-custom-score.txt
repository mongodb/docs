This tutorial describes how to create an index with dynamic mapping on 
the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection. It shows how to run compound 
queries against the ``year`` field and alter the score using 
:ref:`scoring-constant`, :ref:`scoring-function`, and 
:ref:`scoring-boost`. It takes you through the following steps: 

1. Set up an |fts| index with dynamic mapping for the 
   ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection.
#. Run |fts| queries against the ``year`` field in the 
   ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection and alter the score using 
   specific a word in the ``title`` field.

Before you begin, ensure that your |service| cluster meets the 
requirements described in the :ref:`fts-tutorials-prereqs`.

Create the |fts| Index With Dynamic Mapping 
-------------------------------------------

In this section, you will create an |fts| index that uses dynamic 
mapping to index the fields in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection.

You can use the :ref:`compound-ref` operator to combine two or more 
operators into a single query. Every document that |fts| returns for 
your query is assigned a score based on relevance, in order from 
highest score to lowest. In this section, you will connect to your 
|service| cluster and run the sample queries using the 
:ref:`compound-ref` operator against the ``title`` and ``year`` 
fields in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection. The sample queries 
use custom scoring to alter the relevance score returned by |fts|.
