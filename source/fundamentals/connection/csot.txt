Overview
--------

When you use the {+driver-short+} to perform a server operation, you can also
limit the duration allowed for the server to finish the operation. To do so,
specify a **client-side operation timeout (CSOT)**. The timeout applies to all
steps needed to complete the operation, including server selection, connection
checkout, and server-side execution. When the timeout expires, the
{+driver-short+} raises a timeout exception.

.. note:: Experimental Feature

   The CSOT feature is experimental and might change in future driver releases.

timeoutMS Option
----------------

To specify a timeout when connecting to a MongoDB deployment, set the
``timeoutMS`` connection option to the timeout length in milliseconds. You can
do this in two ways: by passing an argument to the ``MongoClient`` constructor
or through a parameter in your connection string.

The following code examples use the ``timeoutMS`` option to specify a timeout of
30 seconds:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoClient
      :tabid: mongoclient

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :emphasize-lines: 2

         const uri = "mongodb://<hostname:<port>";
         const client = new MongoClient(uri, { timeoutMS: 30000 });
   
   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: connection-string

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :emphasize-lines: 1

         const uri = "mongodb://<hostname:<port>?timeoutMS=30000";
         const client = new MongoClient(uri);

.. note:: 

   The ``timeoutMS`` connection option takes precedence over the
   following options:

   - ``socketTimeoutMS``
   - ``waitQueueTimeoutMS``
   - ``wTimeoutMS``
   - ``maxTimeMS``
   - ``maxCommitTimeMS``

   When the CSOT feature is no longer experimental, the preceding options will
   be deprecated. 

If you specify the ``timeoutMS`` option, the driver automatically applies the
specified timeout per each server operation. The following code example specifies
a timeout of 10 seconds at the client level, and then calls the ``insertOne()``
method:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/connection/csot-operation.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start-operation
   :end-before: end-operation

Timeout Inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you specify a ``timeoutMS`` option, the driver applies the timeout
according to the same inheritance behaviors as the other {+driver-short+} options.
The following table describes how the timeout value is inherited at each level:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Level
     - Inheritance Description

   * - Operation
     - Takes the highest precedence and will override ``timeoutMS``
       options set at any other level.

   * - Transaction
     - Takes precedence over ``timeoutMS`` set at the session,
       collection, database, or client level.

   * - Session
     - Applies to all transactions and operations within
       that session, unless the option is overridden by options set at those levels.

   * - Database
     - Applies to all sessions and operations within that
       database, unless the option is overridden by options set at those levels.

   * - Collection
     - Applies to all sessions and operations on that
       collection, unless the option is overridden by options set at those levels.

   * - Client
     - Applies to all databases, collections, sessions, transactions, and
       operations within that client that do not otherwise specify
       ``timeoutMS``.

For more information on overrides and specific options, see the :ref:`Overrides
<node-csot-overrides>` section.

.. _node-csot-overrides:

Overrides
---------

The {+driver-short+} supports various levels of configuration to control the
behavior and performance of database operations. 

You can specify a ``timeoutMS`` option at the operation level to override the
client-level configuration for a specific operation. This allows you to
customize timeouts based on the needs of individual queries.

The following example demonstrates how an operation-level ``timeoutMS``
configuration can override a client-level ``timeoutMS`` configuration:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/connection/csot.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start-csot
   :end-before: end-csot

Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you create a new ``ClientSession`` instance to implement a transaction, use
the ``defaultTimeoutMS`` option. You can set ``defaultTimeoutMS`` to specify the
``timeoutMS`` values to use for:

- `commitTransaction()
  <{+api+}/classes/ClientSession.html#commitTransaction>`__
- `abortTransaction()
  <{+api+}/classes/ClientSession.html#abortTransaction>`__
- `withTransaction() <{+api+}/classes/ClientSession.html#withTransaction>`__
- `endSession()
  <{+api+}/classes/ClientSession.html#endSession>`__

If you do not specify ``defaultTimeoutMS``, the driver uses the ``timeoutMS``
value set on the parent ``MongoClient``.

You cannot override ``defaultTimeoutMS`` by setting the ``timeoutMS`` option on an
operation in a transaction session provided by the ``withTransaction()`` callback.
Doing so throws an error.

Client Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you use Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE), the driver uses the
``timeoutMS`` option to limit the time allowed for encryption and decryption
operations.

If you specify the ``timeoutMS`` option when you construct a
``ClientEncryption`` instance, it controls the lifetime of all operations
performed on that instance. If you do not provide ``timeoutMS``, the instance
inherits the ``timeoutMS`` setting from the ``MongoClient`` used in the
``ClientEncryption`` constructor.

If you set ``timeoutMS`` on both the client and directly in
``ClientEncryption``, the value provided to ``ClientEncryption`` takes
precedence.

Cursors
-------

Cursors offer configurable timeout settings when using the CSOT feature. You can
adjust cursor handling by configuring either the cursor lifetime or cursor
iteration mode if needed. To configure the mode, set the ``timeoutMode`` option
to ``cursorLifetime``, which is the default, or ``iteration``.

Cursor Lifetime Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cursor lifetime mode uses ``timeoutMS`` to limit the entire lifetime of a
cursor. In this mode, the initialization of the cursor and all subsequent calls
to the cursor methods must complete within the limit specified by the
``timeoutMS`` option. All documents must be returned within this limit.
Otherwise, the cursor's lifetime expires and a timeout error occurs.

When you close a cursor by calling the  ``toArray()`` or ``close()`` method, the
timeout resets for the ``killCursors`` command to ensure server-side resources are
cleaned up.

The following example shows how to set the ``timeoutMS`` option to ensure that
the cursor is initialized and all documents are retrieved within 10 seconds:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const docs = await collection.find({}, {timeoutMS: 10000}).toArray();

Cursor Iteration Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cursor iteration mode uses the ``timeoutMS`` option to limit each call to
the ``next()``, ``hasNext()``, or ``tryNext()`` method. The timeout refreshes
after each call completes. This is the default mode for all tailable cursors,
such as the tailable cursors returned by the ``find()`` method on capped
collections or change streams.

The following code example iterates over documents in the ``mflix`` collection
using a cursor with the ``timeoutMode`` set to ``iteration``, and then fetches
and logs the ``imdb_url`` for each movie document:

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   for await (const movie of mflix.find({}, { timeoutMode: 'iteration' })) {
      const imdbResponse = await fetch(movie.imdb_url);
      console.log(await imdbResponse.text());
   }
