Solution Overview
-----------------

MongoDB Atlas powers an end-to-end predictive maintenance solution that
helps manufacturers prevent equipment failures and optimize maintenance
operations through four strategic stages:

1. Machine prioritization and criticality analysis

   - Addresses the question: Which machine should I prioritize for
     predictive maintenance and why? 
   - Uses machine learning and RAG-based analysis to prioritize critical
     equipment.
   - Leverages historical data and expert knowledge to make informed
     decisions.

#. Failure prediction

   - Answers the critical question: What is the root cause of imminent
     failure?
   - Processes real-time sensor data through `Atlas Stream Processing
     <https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-stream-processing>`__.
   - Enables early detection of potential failures before they occur.

#. Maintenance plan generation

   - Focuses on: How should I schedule the repair procedure? 
   - Automatically generates detailed repair plans using large language
     models. 
   - Combines maintenance manuals, inventory data, and resource
     information.

#. Maintenance guidance generation

   - Addresses: How do I get better guidance on fixing machines? 
   - Provides enhanced maintenance guidance by integrating service notes
     and repair instructions. 
   - Delivers instructions directly to technicians' mobile devices
     through `Change Streams
     <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/changeStreams/>`__.

By leveraging MongoDB's unified data platform capabilities like vector
search and real-time analytics, organizations can achieve significant
operational improvements: `reducing downtime by 15-20%, increasing labor
productivity by 5-20%, and cutting maintenance costs by 30-60%
<https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-and-operations/us-predictive-maintenance.pdf>`__.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

Machine Prioritization Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This architecture leverages RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) to
determine which machines require predictive maintenance. The system
processes two types of input data: 

- **Structured data:** Production parameters and machine breakdown
  frequency. 

- **Unstructured data:** Institutional knowledge in documents. 

The workflow aggregates and operationalizes both data types as vector
embeddings in MongoDB Atlas. Using Vector Search, it performs semantic
search to provide relevant context to an LLM (via Amazon Bedrock or Cohere
in this case), which generates contextual responses to prioritization
queries. This helps maintenance teams make data-driven decisions about
which machines need attention first.

Sensor Data Processing Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This real-time architecture processes machine sensor data through six
key stages: 

1. **Data collection:** A prioritized milling machine with DAQ
   (data acquisition) captures critical metrics (product type,
   temperature, speed, torque, tool wear). 

#. **Stream processing:** Real-time transformation of
   raw sensor data. 

#. **Data storage:** Centralized storage in MongoDB Atlas with
   single view capability. 

#. **Change detection:** Monitoring for significant data
   changes. 

#. **ML inference:** Running trained models to predict potential
   failures. 

#. **Dual output:** Visualization through Atlas Charts and mobile
   notifications via Change Streams.

Work Order Generation Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This architecture automates maintenance work order creation through:

1. **Document processing:** Machine manuals and old work orders are chunked
   and converted to vectors using AWS/Cohere embedding models. 

#. **Vector storage:** Embeddings stored in MongoDB Atlas. 

#. **Work order generation:** A specialized app that: 

   - Uses LLMs to generate appropriate work order templates. 
   - Pulls inventory and resource information through aggregation. 
   - Creates detailed repair plans based on machine documentation.

   :alt: Work order generator diagram with artificial intelligence
   
   Figure 4. AI-powered work order generation system diagram

Maintenance Guidance Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This architecture enhances operator instructions through a RAG approach:

1. **Service note processing:** Converts multilingual PDF service notes
   to text.

#. **Translation:** Processes non-English content (Spanish in this case)
   through translation models. 

#. **Instruction generation:** Combines translated service notes with
   original repair plans using LLMs.

#. **Delivery:** Provides updated maintenance instructions to technicians
   through a mobile app.

Each architecture integrates with MongoDB Atlas core capabilities while
leveraging external services (Amazon Bedrock, OpenAI, Cohere) for AI/ML
functionality, creating a comprehensive predictive maintenance solution.
