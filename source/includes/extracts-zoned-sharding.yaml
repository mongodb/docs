## Summary emphasizes defining zones/ranges before sharding

ref: zoned-sharding-pre-define-zone
content: |

   By defining the zones and the zone ranges *before* sharding an empty
   or a non-existing collection, the shard collection operation creates
   chunks for the defined zone ranges as well as any additional chunks
   to cover the entire range of the shard key values and performs an
   initial chunk distribution based on the zone ranges. This initial
   creation and distribution of chunks allows for faster setup of zoned
   sharding. After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the
   chunk distribution going forward.
   
   See :ref:`pre-define-zone-range-example` for an example.

## Summary emphasizes sharding operation can distribute chunks

ref: zoned-sharding-shard-operation-chunk-distribution
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.0.3, the shard collection operation can
   perform an initial chunk creation and distribution for empty or
   non-existing collections if :doc:`zones and zone ranges
   </core/zone-sharding>` have been defined for the collection. Initial
   creation and distribution of chunk allows for faster setup of zoned
   sharding. After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the
   chunk distribution going forward per usual.

   The shard collection operation (i.e. :dbcommand:`shardCollection`
   command and the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` helper) can perform
   initial chunk creation and distribution for an empty or a
   non-existing collection if :doc:`zones and zone ranges
   </core/zone-sharding>` have been defined for the collection. Initial
   chunk distribution allows for a faster setup of zoned sharding.
   After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the chunk
   distribution going forward per usual.

ref: zoned-sharding-shard-operation-chunk-distribution-hashed-short
content: |

   MongoDB supports sharding collections on
   :ref:`compound hashed indexes <index-type-compound-hashed>`. When
   sharding an empty or non-existing collection using a compound hashed
   shard key, additional requirements apply in order for MongoDB to
   perform initial chunk creation and distribution.

---
ref: zoned-sharding-chunk-distribution-compound-hashed-prefix
content: |

   If the hashed field is the prefix of the shard key (i.e. the first
   field in the shard key), all of the following must be true for
   MongoDB to perform initial chunk creation and distribution:

   - The collection has a single zone range with ``MinKey`` for 
     all lower-bound fields and ``MaxKey`` for all upper-bound
     fields.

   - :method:`sh.shardCollection()` specifies the 
     :ref:`presplitHashedZones: true
     <method-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>` option.

---
ref: zoned-sharding-chunk-distribution-compound-hashed-not-prefix
content: |

   If the hashed field is *not* the prefix of the shard key (i.e. 
   the shard key has one or more non-hashed leading fields), all of
   the following must be true for MongoDB to perform initial chunk
   creation and distribution:

   - The collection has one zone range for each combination of distinct 
     prefix field values (i.e. all fields preceding the hashed field).

   - For the lower-bound of each zone range, specify ``MinKey`` for
     the hashed field and all subsequent fields.

   - For each zone range, at least one upper-bound prefix field *must*
     differ from its lower-bound counterpart.

   - :method:`sh.shardCollection()`
     specifies the :ref:`presplitHashedZones: true
     <method-shard-collection-presplitHashedZones>` option.

ref: zoned-sharding-updateZoneKeyRange-change
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.0.2, you can run
   :dbcommand:`updateZoneKeyRange` database command and its helpers
   :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()` and :method:`sh.addTagRange()` on
   an unsharded collection or a non-existing collection.

   Dropping a collection deletes its associated zone/tag ranges.

   .. important::

      Compound hashed indexes block downgrading to MongoDB 4.2. Sharding
      a collection on a compound hashed index significantly increases
      the complexity of the downgrade process.
