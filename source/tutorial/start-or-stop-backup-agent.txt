Overview
--------

For maintenance or troubleshooting purposes, you may want to temporarily
shut down or restart the {+bagent+}. However, for proper
operation of |mms| Backup your |mms| project must have at least one {+bagent+} running. The project needs only one {+bagent+}.

Procedures
----------

Start the {+bagent+}
++++++++++++++++++++++

The procedure to :doc:`Install the {+bagent+}
</tutorial/nav/install-backup-agent>` includes a step to start the agent. If
you must restart the agent, use the following procedure.

Start an Agent Installed with an ``rpm`` Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed the {+bagent+} using an ``rpm`` package, such as on RHEL,
CentOS, or SUSE, issue the following command to start the agent:

.. code-block:: none

   sudo service mongodb-mms-backup-agent start

Start an Agent Installed with a ``deb`` Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed the {+bagent+} using a ``deb`` package, as on Ubuntu, issue
the following command to start the agent:

.. code-block:: none

   sudo start mongodb-mms-backup-agent

Start an Agent Installed with a ``tar`` File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use this command if you installed to Linux or OSX using a ``tar`` file. Issue
the following command from the directory to which you installed the {+bagent+}:

.. code-block:: none

   nohup ./mongodb-mms-backup-agent >> backup-agent.log 2>&1 &

Start the {+bagent+} on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Windows ``Control Panel``, open ``Administrative Tools`` and then
``Services``. In the list of services, select ``MongoDB {+bagent+}``. Select
the ``Action`` menu and select ``Start``.

.. _stop-backup-agent:

Stop the {+bagent+}
+++++++++++++++++++++

If you use |mms| Backup, you must have a {+bagent+} running to ensure
up-to-date backup data.

Stop an Agent Installed with an ``rpm`` Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed the {+bagent+} using an ``rpm`` package, such as on RHEL,
CentOS, or SUSE, issue the following command to stop the agent:

.. code-block:: none

   sudo service mongodb-mms-backup-agent stop

Stop an Agent Installed with a ``deb`` Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed the {+bagent+} using a ``deb`` package, as on Ubuntu, issue
the following command to stop the agent:

.. code-block:: none

   sudo stop mongodb-mms-backup-agent

Stop an Agent Installed with a ``tar`` File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed to a Linux system or OSX using a ``tar`` file, issue the
following command to stop the {+bagent+}:

.. code-block:: none

   pkill -f mongodb-mms-backup-agent

.. _stop-backup-agent-windows:

Stop the {+bagent+} on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Windows ``Control Panel``, open ``Administrative Tools`` and then
``Services``. In the list of services, select ``MongoDB {+bagent+}``. Select
the ``Action`` menu and select ``Stop``.

If you receive a message that your {+bagent+} is out of date, make sure you
are running an upgradeable version of the {+bagent+}. If you are running the
version of the {+bagent+} named ``MongoDBBackup``, you must remove it before
upgrading. To check if you are running ``MongoDBBackup``, issue the following
command in an Administrative command prompt:

.. code-block:: none

   sc query MongoDBBackup

If the command returns a result, you must remove the ``MongoDBBackup`` agent.
To remove it, issue the following:

.. code-block:: none

   sc delete MongoDBBackup
