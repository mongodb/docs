|service| supports using a Key Identifier
provided by Azure Key Vault to configure the
:manual:`encrypted storage engine </core/security-encryption-at-rest>`
on ``M10`` or greater replica set clusters.

This procedure covers configuring Encryption at Rest via 
Azure Key Vault for an |service| project. You must configure
Encryption at Rest using your Key Management for the |service| project 
before enabling it on clusters in that project. For instructions on
enabling Encryption at Rest using your Key Management when deploying an 
|service| cluster, see :ref:`create-cluster-enable-encryption`. 
For instructions on enabling Encryption at Rest using your Key 
Management for an existing |service| cluster, see 
:ref:`scale-cluster-enable-encryption`.

To learn more about Encryption at Rest using your Key Management in 
|service|, see :ref:`security-kms-encryption`.

.. important::

   To disable Encryption at Rest using your Key Management in an 
   |service| project, you must disable it for every cluster in the 
   project *before* removing all configuration details in the project. 
   Do **not** disable or delete any Azure Key Vault keys used by any 
   cluster in your |service| project before you have completely disabled
   Encryption at Rest within the |service| project. If |service|
   cannot access an Azure Key Vault key, any data encrypted by that
   key becomes inaccessible.

Configure Encryption at Rest for an |service| project
-----------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-azure-encryption-for-project.rst
   
|service| automatically creates an
:alert:`encryption key rotation alert <Azure encryption key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days>`
once you configure Encryption at Rest using your Key Management for a
project. You can reset this alert at any time by
:ref:`rotating your Azure Key Identifier <azure-kms-rotate-key>`.

.. _azure-kms-rotate-key:

Rotate your Azure Key Identifier
--------------------------------

For clusters using |service| :ref:`security-azure-kms`, |service|
automatically rotates the MongoDB master keys every 90 days. However,
|service| does **not** automatically rotate the Key Identifier
used for Encryption at Rest using your Key Management. This procedure 
documents manually rotating your |service| project Key Identifier by 
specifying a new key identifier in |service|. This procedure
assumes you have already created a new key in the Azure Key Vault
associated to the |service| project.

.. include:: /includes/steps/rotate-azure-encryption-key.rst

|service| resets the :alert:`encryption key rotation alert <Azure encryption key elapsed time since last rotation is above (n) days>`
timer at the completion of this procedure.
