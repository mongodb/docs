View Query Performance

   :description: Analyze query performance by viewing the explain plan in MongoDB Compass, which includes execution time, returned documents, and examined index keys.

To help you better understand the performance of your query, you can view 
your query's explain plan. 

About This Task 
---------------

On the :guilabel:`Explain Plan` modal, you can view the explain stages as a 
:guilabel:`Visual Tree`, where each query operation appears as a node on the 
tree. You can also view the explain details in raw JSON format by selecting 
the :guilabel:`Raw Output` view.

.. note:: 

   The :guilabel:`Explain Plan` doesn't show aggregation pipeline stages
   such as :pipeline:`$merge` and :pipeline:`$out` because
   |compass-short| ignores all out stages from the aggregation before 
   running the explain plan.

The explain plan includes a :guilabel:`Query Performance Summary` with 
information on the execution of your query such as: 

- Execution time 

- The number of returned documents 

- The number of examined documents 

- The number of examined index keys

.. BEGIN-COMPASS-ONLY
.. note:: 
  
  The :guilabel:`Explain Plan` is not available if you are connected
  to :atlas:`Data Lake </data-lake>`. You cannot view 
  :ref:`vector search<avs-overview>` queries in Visual Tree format.

Steps

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Explain`

      In the query bar, click the :guilabel:`Explain` button to open the 
      modal.
      
      .. figure:: /images/compass/query-plan.png
         :figwidth: 696px
         :alt: Query plan

   .. step:: Select a query operation
      
      By default, the explain stages are are shown as a :guilabel:`Visual Tree`.
      Each query operation appears as a node on the tree.

      For more detailed execution information about the query operation, click 
      the corresponding node.

      For example, the following explain plan provides detailed information on 
      a query that filters for ``{ title : "Jurassic Park" }``:
      
      .. figure:: /images/compass/explain-tree.png
         :alt: Detailed Visual Tree view
         :figwidth: 696px
         
   .. step:: (Optional) Select the :guilabel:`Raw Output` view. 
      
      To view your full explain plan as raw JSON, select the 
      :guilabel:`Raw Output` view.
