The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a standalone
:binary:`~bin.mongod` from version |oldversion| to |newversion|.

.. |downgrading| replace:: :ref:`downgrading <5.0-downgrade-standalone>`

.. include:: /includes/upgrade-guidance-checklists.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you upgrade your standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod`, check 
the :ref:`5.0 Performance Considerations <5.0-rel-notes-performance>` for any 
potential performance impacts when upgrading to |newversion|.

.. include:: /includes/valid-ttl-config-prereq.rst

Confirm Clean Shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to upgrading, confirm that your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance was
:ref:`cleanly shut down <terminate-mongod-processes>`.

Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |oldversion| instance must have ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set
to |oldfcv|. To check ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

The operation should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.4" }``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the following
command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.4" } )

For more information, see :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Consider Converting to Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to upgrading, consider
:doc:`converting your standalone deployment to a replica set
</tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/>`. Replica sets are the
recommended deployment configuration for MongoDB.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Via Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Manually
~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.

Upgrade Process
---------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/5.0-upgrade-standalone.rst

.. note::

   After the upgrade is complete, you may find a significant increase
   in index sizes. To view index sizes, see :data:`dbStats.indexSize`.
   The index size increase is because of time window related data stored
   in index keys.

   If your indexes are significantly larger after upgrading and you
   would like to reduce the index sizes, contact your MongoDB technical
   support representative to discuss solutions.

Additional Upgrade Procedures
-----------------------------

- To upgrade a replica set, see :ref:`5.0-upgrade-replica-set`.
- To upgrade a sharded cluster, see :ref:`5.0-upgrade-sharded-cluster`.
