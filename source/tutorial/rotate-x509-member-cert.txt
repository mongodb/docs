Cluster members can use :ref:`X.509 certificates <internal-auth-x509>` 
for membership authentication to identify other servers
in the same deployment. This tutorial describes how to perform 
a rolling update to rotate X.509 certificates on a cluster
that uses the :setting:`net.tls.clusterAuthX509.attributes` settings to configure 
the cluster members' Distinguished Name (DN) attributes. 

.. note::

   To perform a rolling update to rotate certificates on a cluster that doesn't
   use the :setting:`net.tls.clusterAuthX509` settings and won't after the update,
   see :ref:`x509-rolling-update`.

When a server configured with the :setting:`net.tls.clusterAuthX509.attributes` setting
receives a connection request, it compares the Distinguished Name (DN) attributes 
in the ``subject`` field of the presented certificates to the configured values of the 
:setting:`~net.tls.clusterAuthX509.attributes` setting and
:parameter:`tlsClusterAuthX509Override` parameter.
If the values match, it treats the connection as a cluster member. 

In some situations, you may need to update the member certificates to
new certificates with a new Distinguished Name (DN), such as if
an organization changes its name. 
In a rolling update, member certificates are updated one at a time, and
your deployment does not incur any downtime. 

Clusters adopting new certificates can use the 
:parameter:`tlsClusterAuthX509Override` parameter to accept X.509 certificates
with different subject DN attributes during the certificate rotation procedure. Once
all members use certificates with the new value, remove the override to begin
rejecting the now out of date certificates.

About This Task
---------------

Consider a replica set where member certificates, 
set using the :setting:`~net.tls.clusterFile` and 
:setting:`~net.tls.certificateKeyFile` settings, 
have Distinguished Name (DN) attributes that use the ``10gen`` organization
and ``10gen Server`` organizational unit. These DN attributes are set using the
:setting:`net.tls.clusterAuthX509.attributes` setting.

A member of this replica set has the following configuration file: 

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 6, 8, 11

   security:
     clusterAuthMode:      x509
   net:
     tls:
       mode:               requireTLS
       certificateKeyFile: /etc/mycerts/10gen-server1.pem
       CAFile:             /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
       clusterFile:        /etc/mycerts/10gen-cluster1.pem
       clusterCAFile:      /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
       clusterAuthX509:
          attributes:      O=10gen, OU=10gen Server

The following procedure updates each replica set member's X.509 certificates to new
certificates that have DN attributes that use the 
``MongoDB`` organization and ``MongoDB Server`` organizational unit.

Steps
-----

These steps update member certificates to use new X.509 certificates on a cluster
configured with the :setting:`net.tls.clusterAuthX509.attributes` setting.

The new certificates have Distinguished Names (DN) that change the 
Organization (O) attributes from ``10gen`` to ``MongoDB`` and the
Organizational Unit (OU) attribute from ``10gen Server`` to ``MongoDB Server``.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Update the TLS Cluster Membership Configuration

      Update the configuration file of each server:

      * Change :setting:`~net.tls.clusterAuthX509.attributes` setting to use
        the values on the new certificate

      * Set the :parameter:`tlsClusterAuthX509Override` parameter to use the
        DN attributes of the old certificate.

      For example: 

      .. code-block:: yaml
         :emphasize-lines: 9, 13

         net:
           tls:
             mode:               requireTLS
             certificateKeyFile: /etc/mycerts/mongodb-server1.pem
             CAFile:             /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
             clusterFile:        /etc/mycerts/mongodb-cluster1.pem
             clusterCAFile:      /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
             clusterAuthX509:
                attributes:      O=MongoDB, OU=MongoDB Server
         security:
           clusterAuthMode: x509
         setParameter:
            tlsClusterAuthX509Override: { attributes: O=10gen, OU=10gen Server }

   .. step:: Restart Secondary Cluster Members
   
      .. include:: /includes/procedure-replica-set-restart-secondaries

      Secondary servers in the replica set now accept peer connections from
      members using certificates with the new DN attributes.
   
   .. step:: Restart Primary Cluster Member
   
      .. include:: /includes/procedure-replica-set-restart-primary

      The primary server in the replica set steps down and restarts as a
      secondary that now accepts peer connections from members using
      certificates with the new DN attributes.

   .. step:: Update the TLS Certificates

      Update the configuration file of each server:

      * Change the :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFile` setting to use the 
        new certificate.

      * Change the :setting:`net.tls.clusterFile` setting to use the 
        new certificate.

      For example:

      .. code-block:: yaml
         :emphasize-lines: 4, 6

         net:
           tls:
             mode:               requireTLS
             certificateKeyFile: /etc/mycerts/mongodb-server2.pem
             CAFile:             /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
             clusterFile:        /etc/mycerts/mongodb-cluster2.pem
             clusterCAFile:      /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
             clusterAuthX509:
                attributes:      O=MongoDB, OU=MongoDB Server
         security:
           clusterAuthMode: x509
         setParameter:
            tlsClusterAuthX509Override: { attributes: O=10gen, OU=10gen Server }
            

   .. step:: Restart Secondary Cluster Members
   
      .. include:: /includes/procedure-replica-set-restart-secondaries

      Secondary servers in the replica set now use the new X.509 certificates.
   
   .. step:: Restart Primary Cluster Member
   
      .. include:: /includes/procedure-replica-set-restart-primary

      The primary server in the replica set steps down and restarts as a 
      secondary that uses the new X.509 certificate. 

   .. step:: Remove the DN Certification Override Configuration

      With all members of the cluster now using the new X.509 certificate, 
      update the configuration file to remove the :setting:`setParameter` 
      settings for the :parameter:`tlsClusterAuthX509Override` parameter.

      For example:

      .. code-block:: yaml

         net:
           tls:
             mode:               requireTLS
             certificateKeyFile: /etc/mycerts/mongodb-server1.pem
             CAFile:             /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
             clusterFile:        /etc/mycerts/mongodb-cluster1.pem
             clusterCAFile:      /etc/mycerts/ca.pem
             clusterAuthX509:
                attributes:      O=MongoDB, OU=MongoDB Server
         security:
           clusterAuthMode: x509

      This ensures that the server doesn't configure the old certificate
      settings on startup.

   .. step:: Restart Secondary Cluster Members
   
      .. include:: /includes/procedure-replica-set-restart-secondaries

      Secondary servers in the replica set restart and no longer accept
      connections from the old X.509 certificates.
   
   .. step:: Restart Primary Cluster Member
   
      .. include:: /includes/procedure-replica-set-restart-primary

      The primary server steps down and restarts as a secondary that no longer
      accepts connections from the old X.509 certificates.
