This tutorial uses :ref:`zone-sharding` to route documents based on
creation date either to shards zoned for supporting recent documents, or
those zoned for supporting archived documents.

The following are some example use cases for segmenting data based on Service
Level Agreement (SLA) or Service Level Objective (SLO):

* An application requires providing low-latency access to recently inserted /
  updated documents

* An application requires prioritizing low-latency access to a range
  or subset of documents

* An application that benefits from ensuring specific ranges or subsets of data
  are stored on servers with hardware that suits the SLA's for accessing
  that data

The following diagram illustrates a sharded cluster that uses hardware based
zones to satisfy data access SLAs or SLOs.

Scenario
--------

A photo sharing application requires fast access to photos uploaded within the
last 6 months. The application stores the location of each photo along with
its metadata in the ``photoshare`` database under the ``data`` collection.

The following documents represent photos uploaded by a single user:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : 10003010,
     "creation_date" : ISODate("2012-12-19T06:01:17.171Z"),
     "userid" : 123,
     "photo_location" : "example.net/storage/usr/photo_1.jpg"
   }
   {
     "_id" : 10003011,
     "creation_date" : ISODate("2013-12-19T06:01:17.171Z"),
     "userid" : 123,
     "photo_location" : "example.net/storage/usr/photo_2.jpg"
   }
   {
     "_id" : 10003012,
     "creation_date" : ISODate("2016-01-19T06:01:17.171Z"),
     "userid" : 123,
     "photo_location" : "example.net/storage/usr/photo_3.jpg"
   }

Note that only the document with ``_id : 10003012`` was uploaded within
the past year (as of June 2016).

Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~

The photo collection uses the ``{ creation_date : 1 }`` index as the shard key.

The ``creation_date`` field in each document allows for creating zones
on the creation date.

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sharded cluster deployment currently consists of three :term:`shards
<shard>`.

.. include:: /images/sharding-tiered-slas-architecture.rst


Zones
~~~~~

The application requires adding each shard to a zone based on its
hardware tier. Each hardware tier represents a specific hardware configuration
designed to satisfy a given SLA or SLO.

.. include:: /images/sharding-tiered-slas-tags.rst

Fast Tier ("recent")
   These are the fastest performing machines, with large
   amounts of RAM, fast SSD disks, and powerful CPUs.

   The zone requires a range with:

   * a lower bound of ``{ creation_date : ISODate(YYYY-mm-dd)}``,
     where the Year, Month, and Date specified by ``YYYY-mm-dd`` is within the
     last 6 months.

   * an upper bound of ``{ creation_date : MaxKey }``.

Archival Tier ("archive")
   These machines use less RAM, slower disks, and more basic CPUs. However,
   they have a greater amount of storage per server.

   The zone requires a range with:

   * a lower bound of ``{ creation_date : MinKey }``.

   * an upper bound of ``{ creation_date : ISODate(YYYY-mm-dd)}``,
     where the Year, Month, and Date match the values used for the ``recent``
     tier's lower bound.

.. note::

   The :bsontype:`MinKey` and :bsontype:`MaxKey` values are reserved special
   values for comparisons.

As performance needs increase, adding additional shards and associating them
to the appropriate zone based on their hardware tier allows for the cluster to
scale horizontally.

When defining zone ranges based on time spans, weigh the benefits of
infrequent updates to the zone ranges against the amount of data that
must be migrated on an update. For example, setting a limit of 1 year for
data to be considered 'recent' likely covers more data than setting a limit
of 1 month. While there are more migrations required when rotating on a
1 month scale, the amount of documents that must be migrated is lower than
rotating on a 1 year scale.

Write Operations
----------------

With zones, if an inserted or updated document matches a
configured zone, it can only be written to a shard inside that zone.

MongoDB can write documents that do not match a configured zone to any
shard in the cluster.

.. note:: 

   The behavior described above requires the cluster to be in a steady state
   with no chunks violating a configured zone. See the following section
   on the :ref:`balancer <sharding-tiered-hardware-balancing>` for more
   information.

Read Operations
---------------

MongoDB can route queries to a specific shard if the query includes the 
shard key. 

For example, MongoDB can attempt a :ref:`targeted read operation
<sharding-mongos-targeted>` on the following query because it includes
``creation_date`` in the query document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   photoDB = db.getSiblingDB("photoshare")
   photoDB.data.find( { "creation_date" : ISODate("2015-01-01") } )
   
If the requested document falls within the ``recent`` zone range, MongoDB
would route this query to the shards inside that zone, ensuring a faster read
compared to a cluster-wide :ref:`broadcast read operation
<sharding-mongos-broadcast>`

.. _sharding-tiered-hardware-balancing:

Balancer
--------

The :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` :ref:`migrates
<sharding-chunk-migration>` chunks to the appropriate shard respecting any
configured zones. Until the migration, shards may contain chunks that violate
configured zones. Once balancing completes, shards should only
contain chunks whose ranges do not violate its assigned zones.

Adding or removing zones or zone ranges can result in chunk migrations.
Depending on the size of your data set and the number of chunks a zone or zone
range affects, these migrations may impact cluster performance. Consider
running your :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` during specific scheduled
windows. See :ref:`sharding-schedule-balancing-window` for a tutorial on how
to set a scheduling window.

Security
--------

For sharded clusters running with :ref:`authorization`, authenticate as a user
with at least the :authrole:`clusterManager` role on the ``admin`` database.

Procedure
---------

You must be connected to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` to create zones or zone ranges.
You cannot create zone or zone ranges by connecting directly to a
:term:`shard`.

Updating Zone Ranges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update the shard ranges, perform the following operations as a part of
a cron job or other scheduled procedure:
