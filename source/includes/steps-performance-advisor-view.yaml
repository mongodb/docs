   The :guilabel:`Performance Advisor` displays up to 20 query shapes
   across all collections in the cluster and suggested indexes for those
   shapes.

   .. note::

      The Performance Advisor collects existing indexes for collections
      with slow queries every 24 hours. However, the Performance Advisor 
      generates indexes based on actual queries within five minutes of
      query execution. It is possible to see suggestions for indexes that
      you have already created, but these are removed the next time that
      the Performance Advisor collects indexes.
