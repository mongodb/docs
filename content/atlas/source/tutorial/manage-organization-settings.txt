Configure Session Timeouts
--------------------------

Organization Owners can configure the absolute and idle session timeouts for all users of 
an organization to comply with security and certification policies.

The **absolute session timeout** specifies the maximum duration a user can remain 
logged in to the {+atlas-ui+} without re-authenticating. The **idle session timeout**
specifies the maximum duration a user can remain inactive before {+service+} logs them out.

.. note::

   This feature is in Public Preview. The feature and the corresponding documentation might change at any time during the Preview period. To learn more, see `Preview Features <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/preview-features/>`__.

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- If a user belongs to multiple organizations, their session inherits the shortest 
  idle and absolute timeouts from across all of them. For example, a user's session 
  combines the shortest absolute timeout from one organization with the shortest 
  idle timeout from another. To view the timeouts that apply to you, 
  see the :ref:`Personalization page <atlas-personalization>`. 
- Two minutes before an idle session expires, {+service+} displays a message allowing 
  the user to continue the session.
- Timeout configurations apply only to the {+atlas-ui+}. They do not affect:

  - account access through API keys or service accounts.
  - sessions where users log in to developer tools like {+Compass+}, the Relational Migrator, 
    or the {+atlas-cli+} using their {+service+} credentials. A fixed 12-hour session 
    timeout applies instead of the custom values.
  - sessions where users log in through {+charts+} and {+atlas-app-services+} directly.
  - MongoDB SSO-linked services such as MongoDB University and the Support Portal. 
    These services use a 12-hour session timeout.

  .. important::

     For the tools and services listed above, sessions might still expire in less than 
     12 hours if your main {+service+} web session ends.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-settings.rst

   .. step:: Set the absolute and idle session timeouts.

      a. In the :guilabel:`Configure Session Timeout` section, 
         click :icon-fa4:`pencil`.

      #. Specify the absolute and idle session timeouts.

         The absolute session timeout must be greater than or equal to the idle 
         session timeout.

         For {+service+}, limits include:

         .. list-table::
            :widths: 25 25 25 25
            :header-rows: 1
            :stub-columns: 1

            * - Session Timeout
              - Default
              - Minimum
              - Maximum

            * - Absolute
              - 12 hours
              - 1 hour
              - 12 hours

            * - Idle
              - None
              - 5 minutes
              - Absolute session timeout

         For |cloudgov|, limits include:

         .. list-table::
            :widths: 25 25 25 25
            :header-rows: 1
            :stub-columns: 1

            * - Session Timeout
              - Default
              - Minimum
              - Maximum

            * - Absolute
              - 12 hours
              - 1 hour
              - 12 hours

            * - Idle
              - 10 minutes
              - 5 minutes
              - 10 minutes

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save`. 
         
         The settings apply to the user's next log in.

Add Security Contact Information
--------------------------------

Specify a designated |service| security contact to receive security-related notifications.

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You can specify only one email address to receive security-related 
  notifications including those from the MongoDB Security Team.

- We recommend that you create a mailing list that uses a single 
  address, and specify it as the security contact as a best practice. 
  A mailing list can also send these notifications to multiple users.

- Specifying a security contact does not grant them authorization or 
  access to |service| for security decisions or approvals.

- If the account for the security contact gets deleted, the 
  security contact setting is cleared, and the former security
  contact is shown as the modifier on the related notifications and 
  events.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-settings.rst

   .. step:: Specify an |service| security contact.

      a. In the :guilabel:`Atlas Security Contact Information` section, 
         click :icon-fa4:`pencil`.

      #. Specify an email address.

         Specifying a valid email address enables the :guilabel:`Save` 
         button.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

Delete an Existing Security Contact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete the currently specified security contact:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-settings.rst

   .. step:: Specify an |service| security contact.

      a. In the :guilabel:`Atlas Security Contact Information` section, 
         click :icon-fa4:`pencil`.

      #. Delete the existing email address.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.


Disable Generative AI Features
-------------------------------------

Generative AI features are enabled by default in |service|.
When this setting is turned on, :authrole:`Project Owners <Project Owner>` 
can enable or disable individual AI features at the project level. 
To learn more, see `Generative AI FAQs <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/generative-ai-faq/>`__.

To disable generative AI features for all projects in your |service| organization:

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-org-settings.rst
      
   .. step:: Toggle the button next to :guilabel:`Enable Atlas features that use generative AI` to :guilabel:`Off`.
      
      This disables |service| features that use generative AI across 
      all projects in the organization.

.. _integrations:

Integrations
------------

You can configure |service| for the following integrations:

- :ref:`Slack <add-slack-to-organization>`
- :ref:`Vercel <add-vercel-pointer-only>`

.. _add-slack-to-organization:

Configure Slack Workspaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps-add-org-to-slack.rst

.. important::

   You can authorize only one Slack Workspace for each Organization.

.. _remove-slack-from-organization:

Select Organization to Remove Slack Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps-remove-org-from-slack.rst

.. important::
   This does not stop |service| from sending alerts. To stop |service|
   from sending alerts to Slack, you must :ref:`delete the Slack alert
   setting <delete-alert-setting>`.

.. _add-vercel-pointer-only:

Configure Vercel Integrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can connect your |service| {+clusters+} to applications that you
deploy using |vercel|. To learn more, see :ref:`vercel`.
