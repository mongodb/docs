title: Set up the MongoDB environment.
stepnum: 1
level: 4
ref: create-data-dir
action:
  - pre: |
      MongoDB requires a :term:`data directory <dbpath>` to store all
      data. MongoDB's default data directory path is the absolute path
      ``\data\db`` on the drive from which you start MongoDB. Create
      this folder by running the following command in a
      :guilabel:`Command Prompt`:
    copyable: true
    language: powershell
    code: |
      md \data\db
  - pre: |
      You can specify an alternate path for data files using the
      :cmdoption:`~mongod.--dbpath` option to
      :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe`, for example:
    copyable: true
    language: powershell
    code: |
      "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath d:\test\mongodb\data
  - pre: |
      If your path includes spaces, enclose the entire path in double
      quotes, for example:
    copyable: true
    language: powershell
    code: |
      "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath "d:\test\mongo db data"
post: |
  You may also specify the ``dbpath`` in a :manual:`configuration file
  </reference/configuration-options>`.

title: Start MongoDB.
stepnum: 2
level: 4
ref: start
action:
  pre: |
    To start MongoDB, run :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe`. For example, from the
    :guilabel:`Command Prompt`:
  copyable: true
  language: powershell
  code: |
    "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin\mongod.exe"
post: |
  This starts the main MongoDB database process. The ``waiting for
  connections`` message in the console output indicates that the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` process is running successfully.

  Depending on the security level of your system, Windows may pop up a
  :guilabel:`Security Alert` dialog box about blocking "some features" of
  ``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin\mongod.exe`` from communicating
  on networks. All users should select ``Private Networks, such as my home or
  work network`` and click ``Allow access``. For additional information on
  security and MongoDB, please see the :manual:`Security Documentation </security>`.

title: Verify that MongoDB has started successfully

title: Connect to MongoDB.
stepnum: 4
level: 4
ref: connect
pre: |
  To connect to MongoDB through the :binary:`~bin.mongo.exe <mongo>` shell,
  open another :guilabel:`Command Prompt`.
action:
    copyable: true
    language: powershell
    code: |
      "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin\mongo.exe"

   of :ecosystem:`C# and MongoDB </drivers/csharp>` for more information.
