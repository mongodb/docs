Use the |k8s-op-full| to deploy:

- Ops Manager resources
- MongoDB standalone, replica set, and sharded cluster resources

To deploy MongoDB resources with the |k8s-op-short|, you need an
|onprem| instance. Deploy this instance to |k8s| using the Operator or
outside |k8s| using
:opsmgr:`traditional installation methods </installation>`. The
Operator uses |onprem| |api| methods to deploy and then manage MongoDB
resources.

:ref:`Architecture <k8s-architecture>`
  Review the architecture of the custom resources in the |k8s-op-short|:
  the |onprem| and the MongoDB database.

:ref:`Compatibility <k8s-compatibility>`
  Review compatible versions of |k8s|, OpenShift, MongoDB, and |onprem|.

:ref:`Container Images <k8s-container-images>`
  Review container image details.

:ref:`Single- or Multi-Kubernetes Clusters <k8s-which-to-install>`
  Decide whether to set up single or multiple |k8s| clusters for your custom
  MongoDB resources.

:ref:`Set Deployment Scope <k8s-deployment-scopes>`
  Set the scope for the |k8s-op-short| deployment by configuring which
  type of namespace the |k8s-op-short| should use.

:ref:`k8s-considerations`
  Review |k8s-op-short| deployment scopes and other preparation 
  information.

:ref:`k8s-prerequisites`
  Review the prerequisites before you install the |k8s-op-short|.
