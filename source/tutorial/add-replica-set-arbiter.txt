Arbiters are :program:`mongod` instances that are part of a
:term:`replica set` but do not hold data. Arbiters participate in
:ref:`elections <replica-set-elections>` in order to break ties.
If a replica set has an even number of members, add an arbiter.

Arbiters have minimal resource requirements and do not require
dedicated hardware. You can deploy an arbiter on an application
server or a monitoring host.

.. important::

   Do not run an arbiter on the same system as a member of the replica
   set.

Considerations
--------------

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/arbiters-and-pvs-with-reference.rst

An arbiter does not store data, but until the arbiter's :program:`mongod`
process is added to the replica set, the arbiter will act like any other
:program:`mongod` process and start up with a set of data files and with a
full-sized :term:`journal`.

To minimize the default creation of data, set the following in the
arbiter's :doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>`:

- :setting:`storage.journal.enabled` to ``false``

  .. warning::

     Never set :setting:`storage.journal.enabled` to
     ``false`` on a data-bearing node.

- For MMAPv1 storage engine, :setting:`storage.mmapv1.smallFiles` to
  ``true``

These settings are specific to arbiters. Do not set
:setting:`storage.journal.enabled` to ``false`` on a
data-bearing node. Similarly, do not set :setting:`storage.mmapv1.smallFiles`
unless specifically indicated.

Add an Arbiter
--------------

#. Create a data directory (e.g. :setting:`storage.dbPath`) for the
   arbiter. The :program:`mongod` instance uses the directory for
   configuration data. The directory *will not* hold the data set. For
   example, create the ``/data/arb`` directory:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mkdir /data/arb

#. Start the arbiter, specifying the data directory and the replica set
   name. The following starts an arbiter using the ``/data/arb``
   as the :setting:`~storage.dbPath` and  ``rs`` for the replica set name:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --port 30000 --dbpath /data/arb --replSet rs

#. Connect to the primary and add the arbiter to the replica set. Use
   the :method:`rs.addArb()` method, as in the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.addArb("m1.example.net:30000")

   This operation adds the arbiter running on port ``30000`` on the
   ``m1.example.net`` host.
