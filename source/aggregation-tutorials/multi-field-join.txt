   :description: Learn to perform a multi-field join using the MongoDB Node.js Driver to combine data from two collections in an aggregation pipeline.

Introduction
------------

In this tutorial, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to
construct an aggregation pipeline, perform the
aggregation on a collection, and print the results by completing and
running a sample app.

This aggregation performs a multi-field join. A multi-field join occurs when there are
multiple corresponding fields in the documents of two collections that you use to
match documents together. The aggregation matches these documents on the
field values and combines information from both into one document.

.. tip:: One-to-many Joins

   A one-to-many join is a variety of a multi-field join. When you
   perform a one-to-many join, you select one field from a document that
   matches a field value in multiple documents on the other side of the
   join. To learn more about these data relationships,
   see the Wikipedia entries about :wikipedia:`One-to-many (data model)
   <w/index.php?title=One-to-many_(data_model)&oldid=1112674599>` and
   :wikipedia:`Many-to-many (data model)
   <w/index.php?title=Many-to-many_(data_model)&oldid=1169943560>`.

Aggregation Task Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial demonstrates how to combine data from a collection that
describes product information with another collection that describes
customer orders. The results show a list of products ordered in 2020
that also contains details about each order.

This example uses two collections:

- ``products``, which contains documents describing the products that
  a shop sells
- ``orders``, which contains documents describing individual orders
  for products in a shop

An order can only contain one product, so the aggregation uses a
multi-field join to match a product document to documents representing orders of
that product. The collections are joined by the ``name`` and
``variation`` fields in documents in the ``products`` collection, corresponding
to the ``product_name`` and ``product_variation`` fields in documents in
the ``orders`` collection.

Before You Get Started
----------------------

Before you start this tutorial, complete the
:ref:`node-agg-tutorial-template-app` instructions to set up a working
Node.js application.

After you set up the app, access the ``products`` and ``orders``
collections by adding the following code to the application:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/multi-field-join.js
   :language: javascript
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: start-colls
   :end-before: end-colls
   :dedent:

Delete any existing data and insert sample data into
the ``products`` collection as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/multi-field-join.js
   :language: javascript
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: start-insert-products
   :end-before: end-insert-products
   :dedent:

Delete any existing data and insert sample data into
the ``orders`` collection as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/multi-field-join.js
   :language: javascript
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: start-insert-orders
   :end-before: end-insert-orders
   :dedent:

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Add a lookup stage to link the collections and import fields

      The first stage of the pipeline is a :manual:`$lookup
      </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup>` stage to join the
      ``orders`` collection to the ``products`` collection by two
      fields in each collection. The lookup stage contains an
      embedded pipeline to configure the join.
            
      Within the embedded pipeline, add a :manual:`$match
      </reference/operator/aggregation/match>` stage to match the
      values of two fields on each side of the join. Note that the following
      code uses aliases for the ``name`` and ``variation`` fields
      set when :ref:`creating the $lookup stage <node-multi-field-agg-lookup-stage>`:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/multi-field-join.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: start-embedded-pl-match1
         :end-before: end-embedded-pl-match1
         :dedent:

      Within the embedded pipeline, add another :manual:`$match
      </reference/operator/aggregation/match>` stage to match
      orders placed in 2020:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/multi-field-join.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: start-embedded-pl-match2
         :end-before: end-embedded-pl-match2
         :dedent:

      Within the embedded pipeline, add an :manual:`$unset
      </reference/operator/aggregation/unset>` stage to remove
      unneeded fields from the ``orders`` collection side of the join:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/multi-field-join.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: start-embedded-pl-unset
         :end-before: end-embedded-pl-unset
         :dedent:

      .. _node-multi-field-agg-lookup-stage:

      After the embedded pipeline is completed, add the
      ``$lookup`` stage to the main aggregation pipeline.
      Configure this stage to store the processed lookup fields in
      an array field called ``orders``:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/multi-field-join.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: start-lookup
         :end-before: end-lookup
         :dedent:

   .. step:: Add a match stage for products ordered in 2020

      Next, add a :manual:`$match
      </reference/operator/aggregation/match>` stage to only show
      products for which there is at least one order in 2020,
      based on the ``orders`` array calculated in the previous step:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/multi-field-join.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: start-match
         :end-before: end-match
         :dedent:

   .. step:: Add an unset stage to remove unneeded fields

      Finally, add an :manual:`$unset
      </reference/operator/aggregation/unset>` stage. The
      ``$unset`` stage removes the ``_id`` and ``description``
      fields from the result documents:
            
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/multi-field-join.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: start-unset
         :end-before: end-unset
         :dedent:

   .. step:: Run the aggregation pipeline

      Add the following code to the end of your application to perform
      the aggregation on the ``products`` collection:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/aggregation/multi-field-join.js
         :language: javascript
         :copyable: true
         :start-after: start-run-agg
         :end-before: end-run-agg
         :dedent:

      Finally, run the following command in your shell to start your
      application:

      .. code-block:: bash
      
         node agg_tutorial.js

   .. step:: Interpret results

      The aggregated result contains two documents. The documents
      represent products for which there were orders placed in 2020.
      Each document contains an ``orders`` array field that lists details
      about each order for that product:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false
         
         {
           name: 'Asus Laptop',
           variation: 'Standard Display',
           category: 'ELECTRONICS',
           orders: [
             {
               customer_id: 'elise_smith@myemail.com',
               orderdate: 2020-05-30T08:35:52.000Z,
               value: 431.43
             },
             {
               customer_id: 'jjones@tepidmail.com',
               orderdate: 2020-12-26T08:55:46.000Z,
               value: 429.65
             }
           ]
         }
         {
           name: 'Morphy Richards Food Mixer',
           variation: 'Deluxe',
           category: 'KITCHENWARE',
           orders: [
             {
               customer_id: 'oranieri@warmmail.com',
               orderdate: 2020-01-01T08:25:37.000Z,
               value: 63.13
             }
           ]
         }

      The result documents contain details from documents in the
      ``orders`` collection and the ``products`` collection, joined by
      the product names and variations.
