Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the helper classes, or **builders**, that
the {+driver-short+} provides to create types used in your operations.
Using builders helps you identify errors at compile time and avoid them
at runtime. This guide provides information on builder classes that you
can use for the following tasks:

- Creating a filter definition
- Creating a projection
- Defining a sort order
- Defining an update operation
- Selecting index keys

.. tip:: MongoDB Analyzer

   The MongoDB Analyzer is a tool that helps you analyze your
   builders definitions and understand how your {+lang-framework+} code
   translates into the MongoDB Query API. For more information and
   installation instructions, see the `MongoDB Analyzer reference page <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-analyzer/current/>`__.

You should read this guide if you want to learn more about how to
construct definitions and build up syntax using builders.

Sample Class
------------

The code examples in this guide demonstrate how you can use builders to
create types to interact with documents in the sample collection ``plants.flowers``.
Documents in this collection are modeled by the following ``Flower`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/builders.cs
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-model
   :end-before: end-model

Each builder class takes a generic type parameter
``TDocument`` which represents the type of document that you are working
with. In this guide, the ``Flower`` class is the document type used in
each builder class example.

Construct a Filter
------------------

The ``FilterDefinitionBuilder`` class provides a type-safe interface for
building up queries. Suppose you want to query your collection for
documents matching the following criteria:

- ``Price`` field value less than 20
- ``Category`` field value is "Perennial"

Use builders to create the filter definition with the typed variant:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Filter;
   var filter = builder.Lt(f => f.Price, 20) & builder.Eq(f => f.Category, "Perennial");
   
Using the typed variant form provides compile-time safety. Additionally,
your IDE can provide refactoring support.

Alternatively, you can use string-based field names to contruct the filter:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Filter;
   var filter = builder.Lt("Price", 20) & builder.Eq("Category", "Perennial");

Array Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your document has properties or fields that serialize to arrays,
you can use the methods beginning with ``Any``, such as ``AnyEq()`` or
``AnyLt()``, to compare the entire array against a single item.

Use builders to check which documents in the collection have a
``Season`` array that includes "winter":

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Filter;
   var filter = builder.AnyEq(f => f.Season, "winter");

.. TODO for a complete list of expressions, see the Query page?

Create a Projection
-------------------

The ``ProjectionDefinitionBuilder`` class provides a type-safe interface for
defining a projection. Suppose you want to create a projection on the
``Name`` and ``Price`` fields, but exclude the ``Id`` field.

Use builders to create the projection definition with the typed variant:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Projection;
   var projection = builder.Include(f => f.Name).Include(f => f.Price).Exclude(f => f.Id);

You can also use string-based field names to define the projection:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Projection;
   var projection = builder.Include("Name").Include("Price").Exclude("Id");

Finally, you can use the ``Expression()`` method to define the
projection:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Projection;
   var projection = builder.Expression(f => new { Name = f.Name, Price = f.Price });

This definition has a return type of ``ProjectionDefinition<TDocument,
TProjection>`` whereas the others return a
``ProjectionDefinition<TDocument>``.

Lambda Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver supports using lambda expressions to render projections. When
you define a ``Find()`` projection with the ``Expression()`` method to
create a lambda expression, the driver inspects the expression
to determine which fields are referenced and automatically constructs a
server-side projection to return only those fields.

You can also use lambda expressions to create new fields by performing
operations on values in your documents. The following example shows how
you can use a lambda expression to project a new ``Profit`` field
using the ``Price`` and ``Stock`` fields:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Projection;
   var projection = builder.Expression(f => new { Profit = f.Price * f.Stock });

.. note:: ``Id`` Field Exclusion

   When you create a projection using a lambda expression, the output
   automatically excludes the ``Id`` field unless you explicitly include
   is as a projection field.

Define a Sort
-------------

The ``SortDefinitionBuilder`` class provides a type-safe interface for
building up sort syntax. Suppose you want to define a sort with the
following order:

- Ascending on ``Price``
- Descending on ``Category``

Use builders to create the sort definition with the typed variant:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Sort;
   var sort = builder.Ascending(f => f.Price).Descending(f => f.Category);

Alternatively, you can use string-based field names to define the sort:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Sort;
   var sort = builder.Ascending("Price").Descending("Category");

Define an Update
----------------

The ``UpdateDefinitionBuilder`` class provides a type-safe interface for
building up an update specification. Suppose you want to create an
update specification with the following criteria:

- Create the new field ``SunRequirement``
- Multiply the ``Price`` field value by 0.9

Use builders to create the update specification with the typed variant:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Update;
   var update = builder.Set(f => f.SunRequirement, "Full sun").Mul(f => f.Price, 0.9);

Alternatively, you can use string-based field names to define the update:
   
.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Update;
   var update = builder.Set("SunRequirement", "Full sun").Mul("Price", 0.9);

Define Index Keys
-----------------

The ``IndexKeysDefinitionBuilder`` class provides a type-safe interface for
defining index keys. Suppose you want to select ``Category`` as an
ascending index key.

Use builders to select the index key with the typed variant:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.IndexKeys;
   var keys = builder.Ascending(f => f.Category);

Alternatively, you can use string-based field names to select the index key:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<BsonDocument>.IndexKeys;
   var keys = builder.Ascending("Category");

The ``IndexKeysDefinitionBuilder`` class also provides methods to build
a wildcard index. You can create a wildcard index using ``All field paths`` or ``A
single field path``, in this case using ``Category``:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: ``All field paths``
      :tabid: all-wildcard-index

      .. code-block:: csharp
         :copyable: true

         var builder = Builders<Flower>.IndexKeys;
         var keys = builder.Wildcard();

   .. tab:: ``A single field path``
      :tabid: single-wildcard-index

      .. code-block:: csharp
         :copyable: true

         var builder = Builders<Flower>.IndexKeys;

         // Using the typed variant
         var keys = builder.Wildcard(f => f.Category);

         // Using string-based field names
         var keys = builder.Wildcard("Category");
