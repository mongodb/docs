.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: renameCollection

   The :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command changes the name of an existing
   collection. Use the following form to rename the collection
   named "things" to "events":

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { renameCollection: "store.things", to: "store.events" }

   You must run this command against the :term:`admin database`. and thus
   requires you to specify the complete namespace (i.e., database name
   and collection name.)

   .. note::

      :dbcommand:`renameCollection` will not succeed if you have
      existing data, or indexes, in the new collection.

   The shell helper :method:`renameCollection()` provides a more
   simple interface for this functionality. The following is
   equivalent to the previous example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.things.renameCollection( "events" )

   :dbcommand:`renameCollection` operates by changing the metadata
   associated with a given collection. The duration of the command is
   constant and not related to the size of the collection or the
   indexes; however, the operation will invalidate open cursors which
   will interrupt queries that are currently returning data.

   You may safely use :dbcommand:`renameCollection` in production
   environments.

   .. warning:: You cannot use :dbcommand:`renameCollection` with
      sharded collections.
