Deployment Considerations
-------------------------

All Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To facilitate a robust backup strategy, all MongoDB deployments
should:

- use MMS Backups.

- run all production deployments with journaling enabled. By default,
  MongoDB enables journaling. The journal can facilitate snapshots and
  provides robust durability for :program:`mongod` instances.

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For replica sets, create backups from secondary members to minimize
the impact on the :doc:`primary </core/replica-set-primary>` with
backup operations. Consider using a :doc:`hidden member
</core/replica-set-hidden-member>` as a dedicated backup instance.

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any approach to sharded cluster backups must ensure data consistency
between shards. To create a backup of a sharded cluster you must
:doc:`turn off the balancer
</tutorial/schedule-backup-window-for-sharded-clusters>`.

Additionally, your backup method must synchronize the snapshots of all
shards. MMS uses a synchronization token, but you can accomplish the
same effect by stopping all write operations while capturing backups.

When backing up any sharded cluster, you must also :doc:`back up the
config server metadata </tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-metadata>`.

Testing and Restoring Backups
-----------------------------

A backup system is only useful if it is possible to restore and
recover data using the backup. *Always* test backups to ensure that
restorations are viable, and include recovery testing as part of your
larger backup strategy.

Consider the following restoration tutorials:

- :doc:`/tutorial/restore-replica-set-from-backup`
- :doc:`/tutorial/restore-single-shard`
- :doc:`/tutorial/restore-sharded-cluster`.

Backup Considerations
---------------------

As you develop a backup strategy for your MongoDB deployment consider
the following factors:

- Geography. Ensure that you move some backups away from your
  primary database infrastructure.

- System errors. Ensure that your backups can survive situations where
  hardware failures or disk errors impact the integrity or
  availability of your backups.

- Production constraints. Backup operations themselves sometimes require
  substantial system resources. It is important to consider the time of
  the backup schedule relative to peak usage and maintenance windows.

- System capabilities. Some of the block-level snapshot tools require
  special support on the operating-system or infrastructure level.

- Database configuration. :term:`Replication` and :term:`sharding
  <shard>` can affect the process and impact of the backup
  implementation. See :ref:`sharded-cluster-backups` and
  :ref:`replica-set-backups`.
