When using :ref:`Device Sync (Flexible Mode) <sync>`, there are special
considerations when using the permissions system.

For a guide to setting up Flexible Sync with common permissions models, see the
:ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide`.

.. _sync-compatible-roles:

Sync-Compatible Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If Device Sync (Flexible Mode) is enabled, an assigned :ref:`role <roles>` must
be **Sync compatible**. If the role is not Sync compatible, but its "apply when"
evaluated to true, other roles are not considered; access is denied.

A role is not Sync compatible if any of the following conditions are true:

- ``document_filters.read`` or ``document_filters.write`` are undefined.
- A document filter, insert, or delete expression:

  - References a field that is not a :ref:`queryable field <queryable-fields>`
  - Uses an expansion other than ``%%true``, ``%%false``, ``%%values``, ``%%environment``, or ``%%user``
  - Uses the ``%function`` operator
- Top-level ``read``, top-level ``write``, or field-level permissions are not boolean literals (``true`` or ``false``).
- Field-level permissions are specified for the ``_id`` field.


.. _sync-compatible-expressions:

Sync-Compatible Expressions
---------------------------

When Device Sync is enabled, expressions may only refer to the :ref:`queryable
fields <queryable-fields>` of your data model. If a role refers to any other
fields, it becomes Sync incompatible and cannot be used with Device Sync.

Because a Sync-enabled App assigns roles at the start of a Sync session before
any specific documents are queried, you can't refer to a document or its field
values in an "apply when" expression.


.. _sync-compatible-expansions:

Sync-Compatible Expansions
--------------------------

When using Device Sync, some :ref:`expansions <expansions>` are not supported.
The following table specifies which expansions are Sync compatible in either the
"apply when" or rule expressions:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Expansion
     - Can Use in "Apply When"?
     - Can Use in Rule Expressions?
   
   * - :json-expansion:`%%true`, :json-expansion:`%%false`
     - Yes
     - Yes
   
   * - :json-expansion:`%%values`, :json-expansion:`%%environment`
     - Yes
     - Yes with an :ref:`important consideration <flex-sync-expansions-consideration>`
   
   * - :json-expansion:`%%request`
     - No
     - No
   
   * - :json-expansion:`%%user`
     - Yes
     - Yes with an :ref:`important consideration <flex-sync-expansions-consideration>`
   
   * - :json-expansion:`%%this`, :json-expansion:`%%prev`, :json-expansion:`%%root`,  :json-expansion:`%%prevRoot`
     - No. These expansions refer to the document. App Services evaluates "apply when" expressions at session start, so there's no document to evaluate.
     - No. These expansions might access non-queryable fields of the document, which is not possible.
   
   * - :json-expansion:`%%partition`
     - No
     - No
   
   * - :json-operator:`%stringToOid`, :json-operator:`%oidToString`
     - Yes
     - Yes
   
   * - :json-operator:`%function`
     - Yes
     - No. App Services expands the expansions at the start of the session, so the function would not operate on a per-document basis.
   
   * - :json-operator:`$exists`
     - Yes
     - Yes
   
   * - :json-operator:`$in`, :json-operator:`$nin`
     - Yes
     - Yes.
   
   * - :json-operator:`$eq`, :json-operator:`$ne`, :json-operator:`$gt`, :json-operator:`$gte`, :json-operator:`$lt`, :json-operator:`$lte`  
     - Yes
     - Yes

.. _flex-sync-expansions-consideration:

.. important::

   App Services causes a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` if anything about
   the role changed since the previous session.

   At the start of a session, App Services expands all expansions in the "apply
   when", ``document_filters.read``, and ``document_filters.write`` expressions
   and stores the result. This has the following implications:

   - If the value changes during a session, App Services continues
     to use the value as it was at the time of session start.

   - On the next session, if the value is different from what it was at
     the start of this session, App Services causes a client
     reset.
   
   - You cannot use the :json-operator:`%function` operator in read and
     write rules. Functions would not operate on a per-document basis.
   
   - You cannot store permissions information (such as "which document
     IDs may this user access?") in the user object. Changes would not be
     re-evaluated until the next user session, and updates would cause a 
     client reset.


.. _flexible-sync-permission-changes:

Permission Changes
------------------

If a user's permissions have changed since the last Sync session, Sync triggers
a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>` and re-downloads all data with the new
permissions applied.

A user's permissions might change in the following situations:

- You :ref:`updated the Data Source configuration <appconfig-data_sources>` to
  modify the rules.
- Your rules reference :ref:`custom user data <custom-user-data>` to determine
  permissions dynamically, and the value of that custom user data has changed
  since the last Sync session.

A client reset will **not** be triggered in the following cases: 

- Adding a new collection to an App Services Schema and defining permissions for
  the new namespace or using default roles. This will not trigger a client reset
  because permissions have not been applied previously.
- Configuring custom permissions for the new collection in the same :ref:`draft
  <deploy-ui>` as the new schema. Conversely, deploying a draft with permission
  changes after you deploy the schema will lead to a client reset, since default
  permissions were applied in the initial deployment.

.. _unified-rule-migration:

Unified Rules System
--------------------

Prior to February 23, 2023, Device Sync (Flexible Mode) rules existed in the
``permissions`` field of the :ref:`Sync configuration
<sync-configuration-reference>`. These permissions now exist in the same
configuration files as the non-Sync permissions.

When importing an app configured for the older permissions system, App Services
automatically migrates the permissions to the new unified rules system. You
should not have to migrate apps manually. If you have an old app configuration,
you can import and then :ref:`re-export <export-app>` the migrated
configuration.

For reference, the following changes take place in the migration:

- Move ``permissions.defaultRoles`` to the ``default_rule.json`` file in the
  data source configuration directory at ``data_sources/<data-source-name>/``.
- Move any collection-specific rules to the ``rules.json`` file in the
  respective collection configuration directories at
  ``data_sources/<data-source-name>/<database-name>/<collection-name>/``.
- Rename ``defaultRoles`` to ``roles``.
- Rename ``applyWhen`` to ``apply_when``.
- Move sync ``read`` and ``write`` into ``document_filters.read`` and
  ``document_filters.write``. Ensure both ``document_filters.read`` and
  ``document_filters.write`` are defined.
- Add the following to the roles, adjusting for your use case. You can only use
  ``true`` or ``false``. Generally, you probably want ``true``. The
  ``document_filters`` will restrict read and write access on a per-document
  level.
