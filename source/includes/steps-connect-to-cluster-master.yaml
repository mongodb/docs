  :guilabel:`Choose Connection Type` from the set of available buttons.

  .. note:: Options Display if Feature Enabled

     |service| displays the connection type options after you enable
     :doc:`Private IP for Peering </security-vpc-peering>`,
     :ref:`Private Endpoint <atlas-configure-private-endpoint>`, or
     both. If you haven't enabled either feature, no buttons display
     and **Connection Type** defaults to **Standard**.

  .. tabs::

     .. tab:: Standard Connection
        :tabid: standard

        Use this connection type for allowed public IP addresses.

     .. tab:: Private IP for Peering
        :tabid: peering

        Use this connection type if you enabled peering:

        - For |gcp| or |azure| and are connecting with {{connChoice}}
          from a peered network, or
        - For |aws| and are connecting with {{connChoice}} from a
          peered network which uses a custom |dns| service.

        If neither of these apply, add your IP address to your IP
        access list and use the Standard Connection string. If you are
        connecting directly to |service| from an office or home
        network, this might be the preferred option.

        .. note:: Peer must be available

           You can't select this option unless one of your peers
           is marked as ``AVAILABLE``. Navigate to
           :guilabel:`Network Access` to
           :doc:`check the status of your peers </security-vpc-peering>`.

        .. note:: Multi-Cloud Clusters

           If your application isn't hosted on the same cloud service
           provider as your cluster's :term:`primary`, the application
           can only perform secondary reads.

           With multi-cloud clusters, consider adding the
           :manual:`readPreference </reference/connection-string#read-preference-options>`
           connection option to your
           :manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string>`.
           Use one of the following values:

           - :readmode:`primaryPreferred`
           - :readmode:`secondary`
           - :readmode:`secondaryPreferred`

     .. tab:: Private Endpoint Connection
        :tabid: private

        Use the connection string for the appropriate interface
        endpoint if you are connecting with {{connChoice}} over a
        Private Endpoint connection either because {{connChoice}}:

        - Runs inside your cloud provider network, or
        - Has transitive network access to your cloud provider network.
        - You want to use an :ref:`optimized connection string
          <optimized-connection-strings>`.

        If none of these apply, add your IP address to your IP
        access list and use the Standard Connection string. If you are
        connecting directly to |service| from an office or home
        network, this might be the preferred option.

        .. note::

           You can't select this option unless your configured
           PrivateLink connection is ready to use. Navigate to
           :guilabel:`Network Access` to :ref:`check the status of your
           {+aws-pl+} <atlas-troubleshoot-private-endpoint>`.

           Skip this step if |service| indicates in the
           :guilabel:`Setup connection security` step that you have
           already configured an IP access list entry in your {+database-deployment+}.
           To manage the IP access list, see
           :ref:`Add Entries to the Access List <access-list>`.

        |service| allows standard client connections to the {+database-deployment+}
        from entries in the :ref:`project's IP access list
        <access-list>`. The project IP access list differs from the
        :ref:`API access list <enable-api-access-list>`, which
        restricts *API* access to specific IP or |cidr| addresses.

        If the IP access list is empty, |service| prompts you to add an
        IP address to the project's IP access list. You can either:

        - Click :guilabel:`Add Your Current IP Address` to allow
          access from your current IP address.

        - Click :guilabel:`Add an IP Address` to add a single IP
          address or a |cidr|\-notated range of addresses.

        Provide an optional description for the newly added IP address
        or |cidr| range. Click :guilabel:`Add IP Address` to add the
        address to the IP access list.

        :guilabel:`Add a Different IP Address` to add a single IP
        address or a |cidr|\-notated range of addresses.

     **Skip this step** if |service| indicates in the

     one database user configured in your project. To manage existing
     database users, see :ref:`mongodb-users`.

  To access the {+database-deployment+}, you need a MongoDB user with access to the
  desired database or databases on the {+database-deployment+} in your project. If your
  project has no MongoDB users, |service| prompts you to create a new
  user with the :ref:`Atlas Admin <atlas-user-privileges>` role.

  a. Enter the new user's :guilabel:`Username`.
  b. Enter a :guilabel:`Password` for this new user or click
     :guilabel:`Autogenerate Secure Password`.
      
  c. Click :guilabel:`Create Database User` to save the user.

  Use this user to connect to your {+database-deployment+} in the following step.

  Once you have added an IP address to your IP access list and added a
  database user, click :guilabel:`Choose Your Connection Method`.
