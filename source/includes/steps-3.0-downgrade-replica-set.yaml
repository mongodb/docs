title: "Downgrade secondary members of the replica set."

  Downgrade each :term:`secondary` member of the replica set, one at a
  time: 
     
  a. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod`. See :ref:`terminate-mongod-processes` for instructions on safely terminating :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes.

  #. Replace the 3.0 binary with the 2.6 binary and restart.

  #. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before downgrading the next secondary. To check the member's state, use the :method:`rs.status()` method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

stepnum: 2
ref: step-down-primary
pre: |
  Use :method:`rs.stepDown()` in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to
  step down the :term:`primary` and force the normal :ref:`failover
  <replica-set-failover>` procedure.
action:
  language: javascript
  code:
    rs.stepDown()
post: |
  :method:`rs.stepDown()` expedites the failover procedure and is
      preferable to shutting down the primary directly.

level: 5
stepnum: 3
ref: downgrade-primary
content: |
  When :method:`rs.status()` shows that the primary has stepped down
  and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, shut down the
  previous primary and replace the :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with
  the 2.6 binary and start the new instance.
