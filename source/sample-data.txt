|service| provides sample data you can load into your |service|
clusters. You can use this data to quickly get started
experimenting with data in MongoDB and using tools such as the
:ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui>` and :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>`.

For a list of datasets in the sample and a description of each, see
:ref:`available-sample-datasets`. Each dataset page contains
information on the databases, collections, and indexes in the dataset.

Load Sample Data
----------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To utilize the sample data provided by |service|, you must create
an |service| cluster to load data into. See :ref:`create-new-cluster`
for instructions.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

You can load sample data into your |service| cluster in several ways. 
You can load sample data from the :ref:`{+atlas-ui+} <atlas-ui>`
:guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}`, or using the {+atlas-cli+}.

Select the appropriate tab based on how you would like to load
sample data:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: clusters-view
       name: Clusters View
       content: |

         To load sample data into your cluster from the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}`
         view:
         
         .. include:: /includes/steps/load-sample-data-clusters.rst

     - id: collections-view
       name: Collections View
       content: |

         .. important::
         
            You can load sample data through the
            :guilabel:`Collection View` only if you have 
            :guilabel:`Data Explorer` :ref:`enabled 
            <disable-data-explorer>` and you don't have 
            any data already in your collection.
         
         To load sample data into your cluster from the
         :guilabel:`Collections View`:
         
         .. include:: /includes/steps/load-sample-data-de.rst

     - id: atlascli
       name: Atlas CLI
       content: |

         To load sample data into your {+cluster+} using the 
         {+atlas-cli+}, run this command: 

         .. code-block:: 

            atlas clusters loadSampleData <clusterName> 

         .. see:: Related Links
         
            - `Install the {+atlas-cli+} <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/stable/install-atlas-cli/>`__
            - `Connect from the {+atlas-cli+} <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/stable/connect-atlas-cli/>`__

Sample Data Namespaces
----------------------

When you load the sample data, |service| creates the following
namespaces on your cluster:

.. warning::

   If any of these namespaces already exist on your cluster when you
   attempt to load the sample data, the operation will fail and no
   sample data will be loaded into your cluster.

.. list-table::
