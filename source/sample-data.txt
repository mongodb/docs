Overview
--------

|service| provides sample data you can load into your |service|
clusters. You can use this data to quickly get started
experimenting with data in MongoDB and using tools such as the
|service| :ref:`data-explorer` and :charts:`MongoDB Charts </>`.

For a list of datasets in the sample and a description of each, see
:ref:`available-sample-datasets`. Each dataset page contains
information on the databases, collections, and indexes in the dataset.

For instructions on loading sample data into your |service| cluster,
see :ref:`load-sample-data`.
