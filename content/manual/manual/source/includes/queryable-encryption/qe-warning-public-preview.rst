.. warning:: Prefix, Suffix, and Substring Queries are in Public Preview

   {+qe+} prefix, suffix, and substring queries are available in public preview
   in MongoDB 8.2. Do not enable these query types in production. Public
   preview functionality will be incompatible with the GA feature, and you will
   have to drop any collections that enable these queries.
