MongoDB on Azure - Build an Application
=======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This page outlines the steps necessary to set up your application to
connect to the MongoDB cluster running on Azure worker roles. It is not
a tutorial on building an application.

When connecting to a MongoDB replica set, the client application
(driver) needs to be able to connect individually to each of the members
of the replica set to route reads and writes appropriately. Also with
the MongoDB worker role being deployed with internal endpoints (only
accessible from within the same service), the client application needs
to be deployed as part of the same cloud service as the MongoDB
application.

``MongoDB.WindowsAzure.Sample.MvcMovie`` is an example client application
that follows the steps described below. This sample application along
with its deployment cloud project can be found in the
`MongoDB on Azure Github repos <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-azure/tree/master/src/SampleApplications/MvcMovieSample>`_.

Connect to MongoDB
------------------

Use the ``ConnectionUtilities`` class included as part of the
`MongoDB.WindowsAzure.Common project <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-azure/tree/master/src/MongoDB.WindowsAzure.Common>`_.
To connect to the MongoDB replica set deployed as part of you cloud
service, you need to:

Use the ``MongoDB.WindowsAzure.Common`` project

.. code-block:: sh

   using MongoDB.WindowsAzure.Common;

.. TODO is "using" the correct command, above?

Use the following code snippet to obtain a replica set connection to the
database

.. code-block:: sh

   MongoServerSettingsserverSettings = ConnectionUtilities.GetConnectionSettings();
   MongoServer server = MongoServer.Create(settings);
   MongoDatabase database = server["mydb"];

To create a connection that allows reading from secondaries use:

.. code-block:: sh

   MongoServerSettingsserverSettings = ConnectionUtilities.GetConnectionSettings();
   settings.SlaveOk = true;
   MongoServer server = MongoServer.Create(settings);
   MongoDatabase database = server["mydb"];

For more information on the :ref:`MongoDB .Net Driver's <csharp-language-center>`
``ConnectionSettings`` object, see the `API docs <http://api.mongodb.org/csharp/>`_.

Configuration
-------------

To account for possible changes in the IPs of the instances running
MongoDB, the worker role uses the hosts file to alias each of the
instances. Hence the client application instance needs the same
instances. Additionally the client application must also have the
name of the replica set.

Specify Replica Set Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure your client application deployment project has a setting called
``ReplicaSetName`` that is set to the same value as the ``ReplicaSetName``
setting of the ``MongoDB.WindowsAzure.MongoDB`` role. This can be verified
by ensuring your ``ServiceDefinition.csdef`` file has the following setting
as part of your client application role:

.. code-block:: sh

   <ConfigurationSettings>
      <Setting name="ReplicaSetName" />
   </ConfigurationSettings>

Also your ``ServiceConfiguration.*.cscfg`` files have the value set:

.. code-block:: sh

   <Role name="MongoDB.WindowsAzure.Sample.MvcMovie">
      <Instances count="1" />
      <ConfigurationSettings>
         <Setting name="Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString" value="UseDevelopmentStorage=true" />
         <Setting name="ReplicaSetName" value="rs" />
      </ConfigurationSettings>
   </Role>

Set Up Host Aliases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The included ``MongoDB.WindowsAzure.InstanceMaintainer`` utility takes care
of correctly creating the hosts file. Include this as part of your
client application project and ensure it is always deployed to the Azure
role instance. For example, in the sample ``MongoDB.WindowsAzure.Sample.MvcMovie``
application the following is specified in the ``csproj``:

.. code-block:: sh

   <None Include="..\..\..\MongoDB.WindowsAzure.InstanceMaintainer\$(InstanceMaintainerPath)\MongoDB.WindowsAzure.InstanceMaintainer.exe.config">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
      <Link>MongoDB.WindowsAzure.InstanceMaintainer.exe.config</Link>
   </None>

Ensure the Instance Maintainer is Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``InstanceMaintainer`` utility must always be running on your client
application role to ensure it maintains the hosts file. To enable that,
it needs to be started as part of your role startup. This is done
through the ``Startup`` setting on your ``csdef`` file. For example, in the included
MvcMovie sample app, this is specified as:

.. code-block:: sh

   <WebRole name="MongoDB.WindowsAzure.Sample.MvcMovie" vmsize="Small">
      <Startup>
         <Task commandLine="InstanceMaintainer.cmd" executionContext="elevated" taskType="background" />
      </Startup>
      ....
