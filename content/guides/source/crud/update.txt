Overview
--------

.. short-description::

   Specify which documents to update and how to update them in MongoDB.

In this guide, you will update a field in a document.

.. time:: 10

What You'll Need
----------------

.. include:: /includes/prereqs_read_CRUD.rst

- Data inserted from :ref:`guide-insert-query`.

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-selector:: drivers

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Connect to your MongoDB instance.

      .. include:: /includes/drivers_update_connect.rst

   .. step:: Get the database and collection.

      Switch to the database and collection you wish to work with. In
      this case you will be using the ``{+guides-db+}`` database and
      ``comets`` collection.

      .. include:: /includes/bind_db_update.rst

   .. step:: Update all documents in the ``comets`` collection.

      In :ref:`the previous guide <guide-insert-query>`, you inserted
      documents into the ``comets`` collection. Now, you have a
      requirement to update those documents. All fields are in metric
      units except for the ``radius``, which is in imperial.

      The following example uses an update document to convert
      the ``radius`` field from the metric system to the imperial system
      in all documents.

      .. tip:: Conversion

         1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers

      .. include:: /includes/update_documents.rst

   .. step:: Display your results.

      Many write operations in MongoDB return a result object that
      contains information about the operation.

      For update operations, the result object will contain the
      modified count of documents the driver successfully updated. Here,
      you access this property and print them.


      .. include:: /includes/update_display.rst

   .. step:: Check your results.

      Here is the complete code followed by sample output.

      .. include:: /includes/crud_update_query.rst
