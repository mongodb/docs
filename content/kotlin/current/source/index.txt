Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the Kotlin Driver, the official
MongoDB driver for server-side Kotlin applications that use coroutines.
Download the driver by using `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ or `Gradle
<https://gradle.org/>`__, or set up a runnable project by following our
Quick Start guide.

.. tip:: {+language+} Sync Driver

   If your Kotlin application requires synchronous processing, use the
   :driver:`Sync Driver </kotlin-sync/>`, which uses synchronous operations
   to make blocking calls to MongoDB.

Get Started
-----------

Learn how to establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas and begin
working with data in the :ref:`Get Started <kotlin-quickstart>` section.

Release Notes
-------------

For a list of new features and changes in each version, see the
:ref:`Release Notes <kotlin-whats-new>` section.
