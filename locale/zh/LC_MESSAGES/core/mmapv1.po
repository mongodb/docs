"In order to ensure that all modifications to a MongoDB data set are durably "

"In the default configuration for the :doc:`MMAPv1 storage engine "
"</core/mmapv1>`, MongoDB writes to the data files on disk every 60 seconds "

msgid "Record Storage Characteristics"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:44
msgid ""
"All records are contiguously located on disk, and when a document becomes "
"larger than the allocated record, MongoDB must allocate a new record. New "
"allocations require MongoDB to move a document and update all indexes that "
"refer to the document, which takes more time than in-place updates and leads"
" to storage fragmentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:53
msgid ""
"By default, MongoDB uses :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` so that every document"
" in MongoDB is stored in a *record* which contains the document itself and "
"extra space, or :term:`padding`. Padding allows the document to grow as the "
"result of updates while minimizing the likelihood of reallocations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Record Allocation Strategies"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:64
msgid ""
"MongoDB supports multiple record allocation strategies that determine how "
":program:`mongod` adds padding to a document when creating a record. Because"
" documents in MongoDB may grow after insertion and all records are "
"contiguous on disk, the padding can reduce the need to relocate documents on"
" disk following updates. Relocations are less efficient than in-place "
"updates and can lead to storage fragmentation. As a result, all padding "
"strategies trade additional space for increased efficiency and decreased "
"fragmentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:73
msgid ""
"Different allocation strategies support different kinds of workloads: the "
":ref:`power of 2 allocations <power-of-2-allocation>` are more efficient for"
" insert/update/delete workloads; while :ref:`exact fit allocations <exact-"
"fit-allocation>` is ideal for collections *without* update and delete "
"workloads."

msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:86
msgid ""
"MongoDB 3.0 uses the power of 2 sizes allocation as the default record "
"allocation strategy for MMAPv1. With the power of 2 sizes allocation "
"strategy, each record has a size in bytes that is a power of 2 (e.g. 32, 64,"
" 128, 256, 512 ... 2 MB). For documents larger than 2 MB, the allocation is "
"rounded up to the nearest multiple of 2 MB."

"The power of 2 sizes allocation strategy has the following key properties:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:95
msgid ""
"Can efficiently reuse freed records to reduce fragmentation. Quantizing "
"record allocation sizes into a fixed set of sizes increases the probability "
"that an insert will fit into the free space created by an earlier document "
"deletion or relocation."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:100
msgid ""
"Can reduce moves. The added padding space gives a document room to grow "
"without requiring a move. In addition to saving the cost of moving, this "
"results in less updates to indexes. Although the power of 2 sizes strategy "
"can minimize moves, it does not eliminate them entirely."

msgid "No Padding Allocation Strategy"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:113
msgid ""
"For collections whose workloads do not change the document sizes, such as "
"workloads that consist of insert-only operations or update operations that "
"do not increase document size (such as incrementing a counter), you can "
"disable the :ref:`power of 2 allocation <power-of-2-allocation>` using the "
":dbcommand:`collMod` command with the :collflag:`noPadding` flag or the "
":method:`db.createCollection()` method with the ``noPadding`` option."

msgid "Memory Use"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:130
msgid ""
"With MMAPv1, MongoDB automatically uses all free memory on the machine as "
"its cache. System resource monitors show that MongoDB uses a lot of memory, "
"but its usage is dynamic. If another process suddenly needs half the "
"server's RAM, MongoDB will yield cached memory to the other process."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/mmapv1.txt:136
msgid ""
"Technically, the operating system's virtual memory subsystem manages "
"MongoDB's memory. This means that MongoDB will use as much free memory as it"
" can, swapping to disk as needed. Deployments with enough memory to fit the "
"application's working data set in RAM will achieve the best performance."
