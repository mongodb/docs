|mms| supports |ssl| for encrypting the following connections made by
Automation Agents:

- Connections between the Automation Agents and MongoDB instances.

- Connections between the Automation Agents and |mms|.

Prerequisite
------------

To configure the agent to use |ssl|, you must have a trusted CA
certificate that signed the MongoDB instance's certificate.

Procedures
----------

Connections between Agent and MongoDB Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use |ssl| for the Automation Agent's connection to a MongoDB host,
specify the host's |ssl| settings when
:doc:`adding the host </tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes>` or
by :doc:`editing the host's settings </tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment>`.
