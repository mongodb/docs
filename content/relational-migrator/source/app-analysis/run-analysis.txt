You can run Pre-Migration Analysis against a relational database to
review potential migration risks before migrating data to MongoDB. Running
Pre-Migration Analysis generates a report that identifies risks and provides
guidance on how to mitigate them.

About this Task
---------------

Relational Migrator typically takes 5-10 minutes to crawl the database, though
it can take longer if the machine running Relational Migrator isn't near the
database server.

.. important::

   Relational Migrator supports Pre-Migration Analysis for Microsoft SQL
   Server, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. Pre-Migration Analysis isn't
   supported for databases connected through a JDBC driver. For more
   information on supported databases and versions, see 
   :ref:`supported-databases`.

Before you Begin
----------------

To run Pre-Migration Analysis, you need a :ref:`project with a live database
connection <rm-create-project-live>`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  normal

   .. step:: Open your project

      If your project has no Pre-Migration Analysis reports, Relational
      Migrator displays help text to suggest analyzing your application.

   .. step:: Navigate to the :guilabel:`Pre-Migration Analysis` tab

      You can review previous reports here, or run Pre-Migration Analysis.

   .. step:: Select a relational database connection if one isn't already set
      
      In the Database Connections bar, select the saved connection from the 
      :guilabel:`Relational DB` dropdown.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Run analysis`

      If you didn't save credentials when saving the relational database
      connection, enter them now and then click :guilabel:`Connect
      and run analysis` to continue.
      
      Relational Migrator analyzes the connected source database. You can click
      :guilabel:`Terminate` if you need to stop the process. Once complete,
      Relational Migrator shows the resulting report.

      .. important::

         If Relational Migrator encounters errors, it displays the message "An
         error occurred during the analysis. As a result, there may be
         information missing from the report." If this happens, click
         :guilabel:`Rerun analysis` on the report Summary page to run analysis
         again. If the problem persists, please contact your account 
         representative.

Next Steps
----------

After running Pre-Migration Analysis, :ref:`review the report
<rm-analysis-report>` and follow the recommended actions. You can then re-run
analysis by navigating to the report Summary and clicking :guilabel:`Rerun
analysis` to see if any risks remain.
