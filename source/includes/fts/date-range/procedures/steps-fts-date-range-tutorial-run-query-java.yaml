title: "Run an |fts| ``compound`` query with two clauses on the
       ``movies`` collection."
content: |
  
  a. Create a file named ``DateRange.java``.
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the ``DateRange.java`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:

     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Uses the following ``compound`` operator clauses to query the collection:

       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-date-range-clauses.rst

       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-date-range-stages.rst

     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.
