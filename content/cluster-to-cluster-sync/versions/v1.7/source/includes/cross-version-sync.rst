Starting in 1.7.0, ``mongosync`` can perform a cross-version migration
from a lower major version source cluster to a higher major version
destination cluster. You can migrate up to two major versions ahead. For
example, you can synchronize a cluster running MongoDB 6.0 with a
cluster running 7.0.

Cross-version migration requires additional preparation and
configuration when migrating from a pre-6.0 release. To perform a cross-version 
migration from a pre-6.0 version of the MongoDB Server using
``mongosync``, please `contact <https://mongodb.com/contact>`__ your
account team to inquire about Professional Services.
