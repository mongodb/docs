msgid "MongoDB provides the three approaches to aggregation, each with its own strengths and purposes for a given situation. This section describes these approaches and also describes behaviors and limitations specific to each approach. See also the :doc:`chart </reference/aggregation-commands-comparison>` that compares the approaches."

msgid "The aggregation pipeline is a framework for performing aggregation tasks, modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Using this framework, MongoDB passes the documents of a single collection through a pipeline. The pipeline transforms the documents into aggregated results, and is accessed through the :dbcommand:`aggregate` database command."
