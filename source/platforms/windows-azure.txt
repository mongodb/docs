MongoDB on Azure brings the power of the leading NoSQL database to
Microsoft’s flexible, open, and scalable cloud.

`Windows Azure <http://www.windowsazure.com/>`_ is the cloud services
operating system that serves as the development, service hosting, and
service management environment for the Azure Services Platform. Windows
Azure provides developers on-demand compute & storage to create, host
and manage scalable and available web applications through Microsoft
data centers.

Together, MongoDB and Azure provide customers the tools to build
limitlessly scalable applications in the cloud.

Sign Up for Azure
-----------------

To sign up, go to
<http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/virtual-machines/>.

.. IMPORTANT TODO
   On the wiki, this topic had this outdated content:
   Sign up for ‘Virtual Machines and Virtual Networks’ preview feature from the new Azure portal*
   In the ‘Preview’ portal, go to Account->Preview Features.
   Sign up for the “Virtual Machines and Virtual Networks”
   “*” – The VM Role beta program from the old Azure portal (shown below) is not the same as the preview feature above

.. AND had these graphics (now in the eco/images dir), which also appear to be outdated:
