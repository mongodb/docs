When you use {+qe+}, you define encrypted fields at the collection level 
using an {+enc-schema+}. Encrypting a field and enabling queries
increases storage requirements and impacts query performance. You can 
configure an encrypted field for either equality or range queries,
but not both. Configure fields for the expected query type.

For instructions on creating an {+enc-schema+} and configuring
querying, see :ref:`qe-create-encryption-schema`.


.. _qe-query-types:

Supported Query Types and Behavior
----------------------------------

For a list of supported query operators and behavior with encrypted fields, see :ref:`qe-supported-query-operators`.


Schema Validation
-----------------

{+qe+} requires a server-side {+enc-schema+} to enforce encryption of specific
fields in a collection. Clients using automatic {+qe+} behave differently
depending on the database connection configuration:

- At minimum, local rules must encrypt the same fields as the remote schema on
  the server.

- If the connection ``encryptedFieldsMap`` object contains a key for the
  specified collection, the client uses that object to perform
  automatic {+qe+}, rather than using the remote schema. 

- If the connection ``encryptedFieldsMap`` object doesn't contain a
  key for the specified collection, the client downloads the
  remote schema for the collection and uses it instead.

  .. important:: Remote Schema Behavior

     When using a remote schema:

     - The client trusts that the server has a valid schema
     
     - The client uses the remote schema to perform automatic {+qe+} 
       only. The client does not enforce any other validation rules 
       specified in the schema.


Considerations when Enabling Querying
-------------------------------------

Decide which fields should be encrypted and/or queryable prior to creating your
collection. Changing which fields are encrypted or queryable requires rebuilding the collection's {+enc-schema+} and re-creating the
collection.

If you don't need to query an encrypted field, you may not need to enable
querying on that field. You can still retrieve the document by querying other
fields that are queryable or unencrypted. 

For every encrypted collection, MongoDB creates :ref:`two metadata
collections <qe-metadata-collections>`, increasing storage space. MongoDB
creates an index for each encrypted field, which increases the duration of
write operations on that field. When a write operation updates an indexed 
field, MongoDB updates the related index.


.. _qe-field-configuration:

Configure Encrypted Fields for Optimal Search and Storage
---------------------------------------------------------

MongoDB provides the following parameters to facilitate debugging 
and performance tuning:

.. _qe-field-min-max:

.. parameter:: min, max

   *Query Type*: ``range``

   *Type*: Must match the field's ``bsonType``.

   Required if ``bsonType`` is ``decimal`` or ``double``. Optional
   but highly recommended if it is ``int``, ``long``, or ``date``. Defaults to
   the ``bsonType`` min and max values.
   
   Specify minimum and maximum (inclusive) queryable values for a
   field when possible, as smaller bounds improve query efficiency. If querying
   values outside of these bounds, MongoDB returns an error.

.. _qe-substring-parameters:

Substring Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: includes/queryable-encryption/qe-warning-public-preview.rst

.. parameter:: strMaxLength

   *Query Type*: ``substringPreview``

   *Type*: Integer from 1-60, inclusive.

   The maximum allowed length for a substring-indexed field. Attempting to
   insert a longer string returns an error. 
   
   .. important::
   
      You can override the character limit by setting 
      :parameter:`fleDisableSubstringPreviewParameterLimits`, but running
      substring queries against longer strings has a significant impact on 
      performance.

.. parameter:: strMinQueryLength 

   *Query Type*: ``prefixPreview``, ``suffixPreview``, ``substringPreview``

   *Type*: Positive integer.

   - Must be >= 1 for ``prefixPreview`` or ``suffixPreview`` queries.
   - Must be >= 2 for ``substringPreview`` queries.

   The minimum allowed prefix/suffix/substring length to query. Attempting to
   query a shorter string returns an error.

.. parameter:: strMaxQueryLength 

   *Query Type*: ``prefixPreview``, ``suffixPreview``, ``substringPreview``

   *Type*: Positive integer
   - Must be >=1 for ``prefixPreview`` or ``suffixPreview`` queries.
   - Must 2-10 inclusive for ``substringPreview`` queries.

   The maximum allowed prefix/suffix/substring length to query. Attempting to
   query a longer string returns an error.
   
   .. important::

      This setting strongly impacts query performance. Limit the maximum query
      length whenever possible.

.. parameter:: caseSensitive

   *Query Type*: ``prefixPreview``, ``suffixPreview``, ``substringPreview``

   *Type*: Boolean

   Optional. Defaults to ``true``.

   Whether prefix/suffix/substring queries are case-sensitive. Set to ``false``
   for case-insensitive matching.

.. parameter:: diacriticSensitive

   *Query Type*: ``prefixPreview``, ``suffixPreview``, ``substringPreview``

   *Type*: Boolean

   Optional. Defaults to ``true``.

   Whether prefix/suffix/substring queries must match diacritical marks. Set to
   ``false`` for diacritic-insensitive matching.

Advanced Query Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
   
   These parameters are intended for advanced users only. The 
   default values are suitable for the majority
   of use cases, and should only be modified if your use case 
   requires it.

.. _qe-field-sparsity:

.. parameter:: sparsity

   *Query Type*: ``range``

   *Type*: Integer from 1-4.

   Optional. Defaults to 2.

   Affects how thoroughly MongoDB indexes range values. Low sparsity (dense
   indexing) improves query performance, but stores more documents in the
   encrypted metadata collections for each insert or update operation, causing 
   greater storage overhead. High sparsity does the opposite.

.. _qe-field-precision:

.. parameter:: precision

   *Query Type*: ``range``

   *Type*: Integer.
   
   Optional. Allowed only if ``bsonType`` is ``double`` or ``decimal``. 
   If unset, MongoDB uses the same maximum precision as the ``bsonType``, 
   either ``double`` or ``decimal``.
   
   Limits how many digits after the decimal point are taken into account
   when querying a ``double`` or ``decimal`` field. Additional digits are
   dropped, not rounded. For example, a ``precision`` of 1 treats ``10.18``
   as ``10.1`` for queries. The encrypted value is still stored as ``10.18``.
   
   Specify ``precision`` and limit it when possible. Every digit increases 
   storage overhead and has a high impact on searchable range and index 
   generation. 

.. _qe-field-trimfactor:

.. parameter:: trimFactor

   *Query Type*: ``range``

   *Type*: Integer.

   Optional. Defaults to 6.
   
   The ``trimFactor`` controls the throughput of concurrent inserts and updates.
   A higher ``trimFactor`` increases the throughput of concurrent insert and 
   updates at the cost of slowing down some range read operations. A lower 
   ``trimFactor`` does the opposite. 

.. _qe-contention:

.. parameter:: contention

   *Query Type*: ``equality``, ``range``, ``prefixPreview``, ``suffixPreview``, ``substringPreview``

   *Type*: Integer.

   Optional. Defaults to 8.

   .. include:: /includes/queryable-encryption/qe-csfle-contention.rst

   You can optionally include ``contention`` on queryable fields to change the
   value from its default of 8. 

   For more thorough information on contention factor and its cryptographic 
   implications, see "Section 9: Guidelines" in MongoDB's
