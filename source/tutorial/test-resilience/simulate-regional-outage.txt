You can use the {+atlas-ui+} and |api| to simulate an outage on your
|service| multi-region {+cluster+} and observe how your application
handles an outage in one or more regions.

.. _test-outage-process:

Simulate Regional Outage Process 
--------------------------------

When you submit a request to test an outage using the {+atlas-ui+} 
or |api|, |service| simulates an outage event. During this process,
|service| removes network connectivity to nodes in the selected regions.

Simulate Regional Outage Using the {+atlas-ui+} 
-----------------------------------------------

To simulate a Regional Outage in the {+atlas-ui+}:

1. Log in to the {+atlas-ui+}.

#. Click :guilabel:`Database`.

#. For the {+cluster+} you wish to perform outage testing, click the
   :guilabel:`...` button.

#. Click :guilabel:`Test Resilience`. 

#. Select :guilabel:`Regional Outage`. |service| displays a 
   :guilabel:`Test Resilience` modal with the steps |service| takes to 
   simulate an outage event. To learn more, see :ref:`Simulate Regional
   Outage Process <test-outage-process>`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Select Regions`.

#. Select the tab corresponding to the type of outage you want to simulate:

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: Minority of Electable Nodes
         :tabid: minority

         Select fewer than half of your electable nodes.

      .. tab:: Majority of Electable Nodes
         :tabid: majority
         
         Select at least one more than half of your electable nodes and 
         keep at least one electable node remaining.

         After selecting a majority of your electable nodes, your replica set
         won't have a :manual:`primary node
         </core/replica-set-members#replica-set-primary-member>`. This
         means that your replica set can't perform write operations and
         read operations that are not configured with a suitable
         :manual:`readPreference </core/read-preference/>`.

#. Select :guilabel:`Simulate Regional Outage` to begin the test.
   |service| notifies you when the outage occurs.

#. Select a tab corresponding to the type of outage you are performing:

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: Minority of Electable Nodes
         :tabid: minority

         When you finish testing the outage, click :guilabel:`End Simulation`.

      .. tab:: Majority of Electable Nodes
         :tabid: majority

         When you finish testing the regional outage, you can perform
         one of the following:
          
         - Add electable nodes to your replica set with a :manual:`force
           reconfiguration
           </reference/method/rs.reconfig/#std-label-rs-reconfig-method-force>`.
           To learn more, see :ref:`reconfigure-rs-during-regional-outage`.
         - End the regional outage by clicking :guilabel:`End Simulation`.

Simulate Regional Outage Using the |api| 
----------------------------------------

You can use the :oas-atlas-op:`Test Outage </startOutageSimulation>`
|api| endpoint to simulate an outage event. To learn more about the
outage process, see :ref:`Simulate Regional Outage Process
<test-outage-process>`. 

Verify the Outage
-----------------

To verify that the outage is successful, monitor your application and
ensure your read and write operations are working as expected.
