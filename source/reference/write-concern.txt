Write Concern

Write concern describes the level of acknowledgement requested from
MongoDB for write operations to a standalone :program:`mongod` or to
:doc:`replica sets </replication>` or to
:doc:`sharded clusters </sharding>`. In
sharded clusters, :program:`mongos` instances will pass the write
concern on to the shards.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6
   A new protocol for :ref:`write operations
   <rel-notes-write-operations>` integrates write concerns with the
   write operations and eliminates the need to call the
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` command. Previous versions required a
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` command immediately after a write
   operation to specify the write concern.

Write Concern Specification
---------------------------

Write concern can include the following fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { w: <value>, j: <boolean>, wtimeout: <number> }

- the :ref:`w <wc-w>` option to request acknowledgement that the write
  operation has propagated to a specified number of :program:`mongod`
  instances or to :program:`mongod` instances with specified tags.

- the :ref:`j <wc-j>` option to request acknowledgement that the write
  operation has been written to the journal, and

- the :ref:`wtimeout <wc-wtimeout>` option to specify a time limit to
  prevent write operations from blocking indefinitely.

.. _wc-w:

``w`` Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``w`` option requests acknowledgement that the write operation has
propagated to a specified number of :program:`mongod` instances or to
:program:`mongod` instances with specified tags.

Using the ``w`` option, the following ``w: <value>`` write concerns are
available:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Value
     - Description

   * - .. writeconcern:: <number>

     - Requests acknowledgement that the write operation has propagated
       to the specified number of :program:`mongod` instances. For
       example:

       ``w: 1``
         Requests acknowledgement that the write operation has
         propagated to the standalone :program:`mongod` or the primary
         in a replica set. ``w: 1`` is the default write concern for
         MongoDB.

       ``w: 0``
         Requests no acknowledgement of the write operation. However, ``w:
         0`` may return information about socket exceptions and
         networking errors to the application.

         If you specify ``w: 0`` but include :ref:`j: true <wc-j>`, the
         :ref:`j: true <wc-j>` prevails to request acknowledgement from
         the standalone :program:`mongod` or the primary of a replica
         set.

       Numbers greater than 1 are valid only for replica sets to
       request acknowledgement from specified number of members,
       including the primary.

       See :ref:`wc-ack-behavior` for when :program:`mongod` instances
       acknowledge the write.

   * - .. writeconcern:: "majority"

     - Requests acknowledgement that write operations have propagated to
       the majority of voting nodes [#majority-definition]_, including
       the primary.

       After the write operation returns with a :writeconcern:`w:
       "majority" <"majority">` acknowledgement to the client, the
       client can read the result of that write with a
       :readconcern:`"majority"` readConcern.

       See :ref:`wc-ack-behavior` for when :program:`mongod` instances
       acknowledge the write.

   * - .. writeconcern:: <tag set>

     - Requests acknowledgement that the write operations have
       propagated to a replica set member with the specified :ref:`tag
       <replica-set-configuration-tag-sets>`. See
       :ref:`wc-ack-behavior` for when :program:`mongod` instances
       acknowledge the write.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/reference/replica-set-protocol-versions`

.. _wc-j:

``j`` Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``j`` option requests acknowledgement from MongoDB that
the write operation has been written to the :doc:`journal
</core/journaling>`.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - .. writeconcern:: j

     - If ``j: true``, requests acknowledgement that the
       :program:`mongod` instances, as specified in the :ref:`w:
       \<value\> <wc-w>`, have written to the on-disk journal. ``j:
       true`` does not by itself guarantee that the write will not be
       rolled back due to replica set primary failover.

       .. versionchanged:: 3.2

          .. include:: /includes/note-write-concern-journaled-replication.rst

.. note::

   - Specifying a write concern that includes ``j: true`` to a
     :program:`mongod` instance that is running without journaling
     produces an error.
  
   - For replica sets using :rsconf:`protocolVersion: 1
     <protocolVersion>`, if journaling is enabled, :writeconcern:`w:
     "majority" <"majority">` may imply ``j: true``. The
     :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` replica set
     configuration setting determines the behavior. See
     :ref:`wc-ack-behavior` for details.

.. _wc-wtimeout:

``wtimeout``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option specifies a time limit, in milliseconds, for the write
concern. ``wtimeout`` is only applicable for ``w`` values greater than
``1``.

``wtimeout`` causes write operations to return with an error
after the specified limit, even if the required write concern will
eventually succeed. When these write operations return,
MongoDB **does not** undo successful data modifications performed
before the write concern exceeded the ``wtimeout`` time limit.

If you do not specify the ``wtimeout`` option and the level of write
concern is unachievable, the write operation will block indefinitely.
Specifying a ``wtimeout`` value of ``0`` is equivalent to a write
concern without the ``wtimeout`` option.

.. _wc-ack-behavior:

Acknowledgement Behavior
------------------------

The :ref:`w <wc-w>` option and the :ref:`j <wc-j>` option determine
when :program:`mongod` instances acknowledge write operations. 

Standalone
~~~~~~~~~~

A standalone :program:`mongod` acknowledges a write operation either
after applying the write in memory or after writing to the on-disk
journal. The following table lists the acknowledgement behavior for a
standalone and the relevant write concerns:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 40 25 20

   * -
     - ``j`` is unspecified
     - ``j:true``
     - ``j:false``

   * - ``w: 1``
     - In memory
     - On-disk journal
     - In memory

   * - ``w: "majority"``
     - On-disk journal *if running with journaling*
     - On-disk journal
     - In memory

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/no-journaling-rollback.rst

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.4

A replica set acknowledges a write operation either after the specified
number of members apply the write in memory or after they write to the
on-disk journal. The number of members is specified by the :ref:`w:
\<value\> <wc-w>` setting. The following table lists the
acknowledgement behavior for these members and the relevant write
concerns [#3.2-behavior]_:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 50 22 20

   * -
     - ``j`` is unspecified
     - ``j:true``
     - ``j:false``

   * - ``w: "majority"``

     - Depends on the value of
       :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault`.

       - If true, On-disk journal.

       - If false, In memory.

       .. versionchanged:: 3.4
          
     - On-disk journal

     - In memory

   * - ``w: <number>``

     - In memory

     - On-disk journal

     - In memory

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/no-journaling-rollback.rst

.. [#3.2-behavior]

   For the behavior in version 3.2, refer to the :v3.2:`3.2 manual
   </reference/write-concern>`.

.. [#majority-definition]

   .. versionchanged:: 3.0

      Prior to MongoDB 3.0, ``w: "majority"`` refers to the majority of
      the replica set's members instead of the majority of the replica
      set's voting members.
