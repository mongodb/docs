Definition
----------

.. method:: db.upgradeCheck(<document>)

   .. versionadded:: 2.6

   Performs a preliminary check for upgrade preparedness to 2.6. The
   helper, available in the 2.6 :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, can run
   connected to either a 2.4 or a 2.6 server.

   The method checks for:

   - documents with index keys :ref:`longer than the index key limit
     <2.6-index-key-length-incompatibility>`,

   - documents with :limit:`illegal field names
     <Restrictions on Field Names>`,

   - collections without an ``_id`` index, and

   - indexes with invalid specifications, such as an index key with an
     empty or illegal field name.

   The method can accept a document parameter which determine the scope
   of the check:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Parameter
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``scope``
   
        - document
   
        - Optional. Document to limit the scope of the check to the specified collection
          in the database.
          
          Omit to perform the check on all collections in the database.
          
          
   


   The optional scope document has the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         collection: <string>
      }

   Additional 2.6 changes that affect compatibility with older versions
   require manual checks and intervention. See
   :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-compatibility` for details.

Behavior
--------

.. |method| replace:: :method:`db.upgradeCheck()`

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgradeCheck-behavior.rst

Required Access
---------------

On systems running with :setting:`~security.authorization`, a user must have access that
includes the :authaction:`find` action on all collections, including
the :doc:`system collections </reference/system-collections>`.

Example
-------

The following example connects to a secondary running on ``localhost``
and runs :method:`db.upgradeCheck()` against the ``employees``
collection in the ``records`` database. Because the output from the
method can be quite large, the example pipes the output to a file.

.. code-block:: sh

   ./mongo --eval "db.getMongo().setReadPref('secondary'); db.upgradeCheck( { collection: 'employees' } )"  localhost/records | tee /tmp/upgradecheck.txt

.. include:: /includes/output-upgrade-check.rst
