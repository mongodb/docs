The Atlas SQL interface is a SQL-92 compatible dialect (read-only) with 
some :ref:`limitations <sql-limitations>`. 
This reference covers specific capabilities of the dialect that are 
included to make it easier for you to interact with document structures.

FLATTEN
-------

``FLATTEN`` flattens semi-structured data (name-value pairs in 
JSON) into separate columns. Field names become column names that hold 
all of the values for that field in rows.

Syntax
~~~~~~

The syntax for flattening nested documents is a ``FLATTEN`` function 
that can be used in the ``FROM`` clause in conjunction with a data 
source and options.

.. code-block::

   SELECT * FROM FLATTEN(<data source> WITH DEPTH => <integer>, SEPARATOR => <string>)

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Variable
     - Necessity
     - Description

   * - <data source>
     - Required
     - Data source to flatten.

   * - ``DEPTH``
     - Optional
     - Positive integer indicating how many levels of subdocuments to 
       flatten. Defaults to flattening every level of subdocuments.

   * - ``SEPARATOR``
     - Optional
     - String to use as the delimiter when concatenating 
       field names. Defaults to ``_``.

Flatten Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In an example scenario, a ``customerInfo`` collection contains 
documents that are structured as follows:

.. code-block:: json
   
   { 
     id: 1,
     location: "New York",
     customer: {
       age: 50,
       email: "customer@email.com",
       satisfaction: 5
     }
   }

If you run the query ``SELECT * FROM customerInfo``, 
{+asql+} returns documents with the following top-level fields:

.. list-table::

   * - ``id``
     - 1

   * - ``location``
     - "New York"

   * - ``customer``
     - { age: 50, email: "customer@email.com", satisfaction: 5 }

If you run the query ``SELECT * FROM FLATTEN(customerInfo)``, 
{+asql+} returns documents with the following top-level fields:

.. list-table::

   * - ``id``
     - 1

   * - ``location``
     - "New York"

   * - ``customer_age``
     - 50

   * - ``customer_email``
     - "customer@email.com"

   * - ``customer_satisfaction``
     - 5

When you use ``FLATTEN``, each flattened field from the original 
document becomes a top-level field in the result set. Nested fields are 
concatenated with their parent field names and separated by the default 
delimiter, ``_``.
     
UNWIND
------

``UNWIND`` deconstructs an array field from the input data source to 
output one row for each item in that array. To learn more about 
unwinding, see the 
:manual:`$unwind </reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/>` aggregation 
stage documentation.

Syntax
~~~~~~

The syntax for unwinding array fields is an ``UNWIND`` function that 
can be used in the ``FROM`` clause in conjunction with a data source 
and options.

.. code-block::

   SELECT * FROM UNWIND(<data source> WITH PATH => <array_path>, INDEX => <integer>, OUTER => <bool>)

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Variable
     - Necessity
     - Description

   * - <data source>
     - Required
     - Source of the array field to unwind.

   * - ``PATH``
     - Required
     - Path to the field in the data source to 
       unwind.

   * - ``INDEX``
     - Optional
     - Name to assign the index column. If omitted, {+asql+} does 
       not create an index field.

   * - ``OUTER``
     - Optional
     - Flag that indicates whether documents with null, missing, or 
       empty array values are preserved. If ``true``, documents with 
       null, missing, or empty array values are preserved. Defaults to 
       ``false``.

Unwind Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In an example scenario, a ``customerInfo`` collection contains 
documents that are structured as follows:

.. code-block:: json
   
   { 
     id: 1,
     location: "New York",
     customer: {
       age: 50,
       email: "customer@email.com",
       satisfaction: 5
     },
     visits: [
       {
         year: 2020,
         score: 10
       },
       {
         year: 2021,
         score: 8
       },
       {
         year: 2022
         score: 7
       }
     ]
   }

If you run the query ``SELECT * FROM customerInfo``, 
{+asql+} returns documents with the following top-level fields:

.. list-table::

   * - ``id``
     - 1

   * - ``location``
     - "New York"

   * - ``customer``
     - { age: 50, email: "customer@email.com", satisfaction: 5 }

   * - ``visits``
     - [ { year: 2020, score: 10 }, { year: 2021, score: 8 }, { year: 2022, score: 7 } ]

If you run the query 
``SELECT * FROM UNWIND(customerInfo WITH PATH => visits, INDEX => idx)``, 
{+asql+} returns documents with the following top-level fields:

.. list-table::

   * - ``id``
     - 1
     - 1
     - 1

   * - ``location``
     - "New York"
     - "New York"
     - "New York"

   * - ``customer``
     - { age: 50, email: "customer@email.com", satisfaction: 5 }
     - { age: 50, email: "customer@email.com", satisfaction: 5 }
     - { age: 50, email: "customer@email.com", satisfaction: 5 }

   * - ``idx``
     - 0
     - 1
     - 2

   * - ``visits``
     - { year: 2020, score: 10 }
     - { year: 2021, score: 8 }
     - { year: 2022, score: 7 }
     

When you use ``UNWIND`` with ``PATH => visits``, each ``visits`` object 
becomes a table row.

Unwind and Flatten Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example combines the ``FLATTEN`` and ``UNWIND`` functions.

In an example scenario, a ``customerInfo`` collection contains 
documents that are structured as follows:

.. code-block:: json
   
   { 
     id: 1,
     location: "New York",
     customer: {
       age: 50,
       email: "customer@email.com",
       satisfaction: 5
     },
     visits: [
       {
         year: 2020,
         score: 10
       },
       {
         year: 2021,
         score: 8
       },
       {
         year: 2022
         score: 7
       }
     ]
   }

If you run the query ``SELECT * FROM customerInfo``, 
{+asql+} returns documents with the following top-level fields:

.. list-table::

   * - ``id``
     - 1

   * - ``location``
     - "New York"

   * - ``satisfaction``
     - 5

   * - ``customer``
     - { age: 50, email: "customer@email.com", satisfaction: 5 }

   * - ``visits``
     - [ { year: 2020, score: 10 }, { year: 2021, score: 8 }, { year: 2022, score: 7 } ]

If you run the query 
``Select * from FLATTEN(UNWIND(customerInfo WITH PATH => visits, INDEX => idx))``, 
{+asql+} returns documents with the following top-level fields:

.. list-table::

   * - ``id``
     - 1
     - 1
     - 1

   * - ``location``
     - "New York"
     - "New York"
     - "New York"

   * - ``satisfaction``
     - 5
     - 5
     - 5

   * - ``customer_age``
     - 50
     - 50
     - 50

   * - ``customer_email``
     - "customer@email.com"
     - "customer@email.com"
     - "customer@email.com"

   * - ``idx``
     - 0
     - 1
     - 2

   * - ``visits_year``
     - 2020
     - 2021
     - 2022

   * - ``visits_score``
     - 10
     - 8
     - 7

When you use both the ``FLATTEN`` and ``UNWIND`` functions, {+asql+} 
flattens the ``customer`` nested document, and unwinds and flattens the 
``visits`` array.

.. _sql-limitations:

Limitations
-----------

{+asql+} is not fully SQL-92 compatible due to the following 
limitations:

- The ``UNION`` function is not supported. However, ``UNION ALL`` is 
  supported.

- The ``date`` data type is not supported. Use ``timestamp`` instead.

- Interval and date interval arithmetic are not supported.
