Read Preference Modes
---------------------

.. readmode:: primary

   All read operations use only the current replica set
   :term:`primary`. [#edge-cases-2-primaries]_ This is the default read
   mode. If the primary is unavailable, read operations produce an
   error or throw an exception.

   The :readmode:`primary` read preference mode is not compatible with
   read preference modes that use :ref:`tag sets
   <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`. If you specify a tag set
   with :readmode:`primary`, the driver will produce an error.

.. readmode:: primaryPreferred

   In most situations, operations read from the :term:`primary` member
   of the set. However, if the primary is unavailable, as is the case
   during :term:`failover` situations, operations read from secondary
   members.

   When the read preference includes a :ref:`tag set
   <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`, the client reads first from
   the primary, if available, and then from :term:`secondaries
   <secondary>` that match the specified tags. If no secondaries have
   matching tags, the read operation produces an error.

   Since the application may receive data from a secondary, read
   operations using the :readmode:`primaryPreferred` mode may return
   stale data in some situations.

   .. warning::

      .. versionchanged:: 2.2
         :binary:`~bin.mongos` added full support for read preferences.

      When connecting to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance older than 2.2,
      using a client that supports read preference modes,
      :readmode:`primaryPreferred` will send queries to secondaries.

.. readmode:: secondary

   Operations read *only* from the :term:`secondary` members of the set.
   If no secondaries are available, then this read operation produces an
   error or exception.

   Most sets have at least one secondary, but there are situations
   where there may be no available secondary. For example, a set with
   a primary, a secondary, and an :term:`arbiter` may not have any
   secondaries if a member is in recovering state or unavailable.

   When the read preference includes a :ref:`tag set
   <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`, the client attempts to
   find secondary members that match the specified tag set and directs
   reads to a random secondary from among the :ref:`nearest group
   <replica-set-read-preference-behavior-nearest>`. If no secondaries
   have matching tags, the read operation produces an
   error. [#capacity-planning]_

   Read operations using the :readmode:`secondary` mode may return stale data.

.. readmode:: secondaryPreferred

   In most situations, operations read from :term:`secondary` members,
   but in situations where the set consists of a single
   :term:`primary` (and no other members), the read operation will use
   the set's primary.

   When the read preference includes a :ref:`tag set
   <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`, the client attempts to find
   a secondary member that matches the specified tag set and directs
   reads to a random secondary from among the :ref:`nearest group
   <replica-set-read-preference-behavior-nearest>`. If no secondaries
   have matching tags, the client ignores tags and reads from the primary.

   Read operations using the :readmode:`secondaryPreferred` mode may
   return stale data.

.. readmode:: nearest

   The driver reads from the *nearest* member of the :term:`set <replica
   set>` according to the :ref:`member selection
   <replica-set-read-preference-behavior-nearest>` process. Reads in
   the :readmode:`nearest` mode do not consider the member's
   *type*. Reads in :readmode:`nearest` mode may read from both
   primaries and secondaries.

   Set this mode to minimize the effect of network latency
   on read operations without preference for current or stale data.

   If you specify a :ref:`tag set
   <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`, the client attempts to
   find a replica set member that matches the specified tag set and
   directs reads to an arbitrary member from among the :ref:`nearest
   group <replica-set-read-preference-behavior-nearest>`.

   Read operations using the :readmode:`nearest` mode may return stale
   data.

   .. note::

      All operations read from a member of the nearest group of the
      replica set that matches the specified read preference mode. The
      :readmode:`nearest` mode prefers low latency reads over a
      member's :term:`primary` or :term:`secondary` status.

      For :readmode:`nearest`, the client assembles a list of
      acceptable hosts based on tag set and then narrows that list to
      the host with the shortest ping time and all other members of
      the set that are within the "local threshold," or acceptable
      latency. See :ref:`replica-set-read-preference-behavior-nearest`
      for more information.

Use Cases
---------

Depending on the requirements of an application, you can configure
different applications to use
different read preferences, or use different read preferences for different
queries in the same application. Consider the following applications
for different read preference strategies.

.. _maximize-consistency:

Maximize Consistency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To avoid *stale* reads, use :readmode:`primary` read preference. If the
primary is unavailable, e.g. during elections or when a majority of the
replica set is not accessible, read operations produce an error or
throw an exception.

In some rare edge cases, it may be possible for a replica set to
temporarily have two primaries. For example,

- A partial :term:`network partition` may segregate a primary (``p``\
  :sub:`old`) into a partition with a minority of the nodes, while the
  other side of the partition contains a majority of nodes. The
  partition with the majority will elect a new primary (``P``\
  :sub:`new`), but for a brief period, the old primary (``p``\
  :sub:`old`) may still continue to serve reads and writes, as it has
  not yet detected that it can only see a minority of nodes in the
  replica set. During this period, if the old primary (``p``\
  :sub:`old`) is still visible to clients as a primary, reads from this
  primary may reflect stale data.

- A primary (``p``\ :sub:`old`) may become unresponsive, which will
  trigger an election and a new primary (``P``\ :sub:`new`) can be
  elected, serving reads and writes. If the unresponsive primary
  (``p``\ :sub:`old`) starts responding again, two primaries will be
  visible for a brief period. The brief period will end when ``p``\
  :sub:`old` steps down. However, during the brief period, clients
  might read from the old primary ``p``\ :sub:`old`, which can provide
  stale data.

To increase consistency, you can disable automatic :term:`failover`;
however, disabling automatic failover sacrifices availability.

Maximize Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To permit read operations when possible, use
:readmode:`primaryPreferred`. When there's a primary you will get
consistent reads [#edge-cases-2-primaries]_, but if there is no primary
you can still query :term:`secondaries <secondary>`. However, when
using this read mode, consider the situation described in
:ref:`caveat-secondaryPreferred`.

Minimize Latency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To always read from a low-latency node, use :readmode:`nearest`. The
driver or :binary:`~bin.mongos` will read from the nearest member and
those no more than 15 milliseconds [#secondary-acceptable-latency]_
further away than the nearest member.

:readmode:`nearest` does *not* guarantee consistency. If the nearest
member to your application server is a secondary with some replication
lag, queries could return stale data. :readmode:`nearest` only
reflects network distance and does not reflect I/O or CPU load.

Query From Geographically Distributed Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the members of a replica set are geographically distributed, you
can create replica tags based that reflect the location of the instance and
then configure your application to query the members nearby.

For example, if members in "east" and "west" data centers are
:ref:`tagged <replica-set-configuration-tag-sets>` ``{'dc': 'east'}`` and
``{'dc': 'west'}``, your application servers in the east data center can read
from nearby members with the following read preference:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.find().readPref( { mode: 'nearest',
                                    tags: [ {'dc': 'east'} ] } )

Although :readmode:`nearest` already favors members with low network latency,
including the tag makes the choice more predictable.

.. _caveat-secondaryPreferred:

Reduce load on the primary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To shift read load from the primary, use mode
:readmode:`secondary`. Although :readmode:`secondaryPreferred` is tempting for
this use case, it carries some risk: if all secondaries are unavailable and
your set has enough :term:`arbiters <arbiter>` to prevent the primary from
stepping down, then the primary will receive all traffic from clients. If the
primary is unable to handle this load, queries will compete with writes. For
this reason, use :readmode:`secondary` to distribute read load to replica sets,
not :readmode:`secondaryPreferred`.

Read Preferences for Database Commands
--------------------------------------

Because some :term:`database commands <database command>` read and
return data from the database, all of the official drivers support
full :ref:`read preference mode semantics <replica-set-read-preference-modes>`
for the following commands:

- :dbcommand:`group`
- :dbcommand:`mapReduce` [#inline-map-reduce]_
- :dbcommand:`aggregate` [#aggregation-out]_
- :dbcommand:`collStats`
- :dbcommand:`dbStats`
- :dbcommand:`count`
- :dbcommand:`distinct`
- :dbcommand:`geoNear`
- :dbcommand:`geoSearch`
- :dbcommand:`geoWalk`
- :dbcommand:`parallelCollectionScan`

.. versionadded:: 2.4
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` adds support for routing commands to shards using
   read preferences. Previously :binary:`~bin.mongos` sent all commands to
   shards' primaries.

.. [#capacity-planning] If your set has more than one secondary, and
   you use the :readmode:`secondary` read preference mode, consider
   the following effect. If you have a :ref:`three member replica set
   <replica-set-three-members>` with a primary and two secondaries,
   and one secondary becomes unavailable, all :readmode:`secondary`
   queries must target the remaining secondary. This will double the
   load on this secondary. Plan and provide capacity to support this
   as needed.

.. [#secondary-acceptable-latency] This threshold is configurable. See
   :setting:`~replication.localPingThresholdMs` for :binary:`~bin.mongos` or your driver
   documentation for the appropriate setting.

.. [#inline-map-reduce] Only "inline" :dbcommand:`mapReduce`
   operations that do not write data support read preference,
   otherwise these operations must run on the :term:`primary`
   members.

.. [#aggregation-out] Using the ``$out`` pipeline operator forces the
   aggregation pipeline to run on the primary.
