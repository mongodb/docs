Installation

.. note::

   As of MongoDB Server version 3.6, MongoDB packages a
   platform-specific |compass-short| installation script with

   see the :manual:`install_compass script
   </reference/program/install_compass/>` documentation.

         Open the {+download-page+} and download the latest version of
         |compass| for OS X. The package downloads as a ``.dmg`` disk
         image. Once you have downloaded |compass-short|, click on the
         ``.dmg`` file to open the disk image within the OS X Finder.
         Drag the |compass| application to your
         :guilabel:`Applications` folder and unmount the disk image.

         .. note::

            Depending on your system's security settings, you may have
            to modify your system settings to grant |compass-short|
            permissions to run. You may be prompted to enter your
            system password before launching |compass-short|.

         .. note::

            The Windows installation of |compass| requires
            **Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5 or later.** The
            |compass-short| installer prompts you to install the
            minimum required version of the .NET framework if it is
            not already installed on your system.

         The |compass| setup application is available as an
         ``.exe`` executable file. Open the {+download-page+} and
         download the latest version of |compass| for Windows.

         Once you have downloaded the executable, run the file to begin
         the setup process, which installs |compass-short|. The
         executable file always installs |compass-short| to the
         following path:

         .. code-block:: none

            C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\<MongoDB Compass Edition>\

         Once installed, |compass-short| launches automatically and prompts you to
         configure privacy settings and specify update preferences.

Compass Firewall Requirements
-----------------------------

Certain features of |compass|, such as third-party mapping services and
Intercom, require inbound connections from external sources to
function. In some instances, users have reported issues with their
system firewall blocking these network requests and thereby limiting
|compass| functionalities. To fix this issue, configure your system
firewall to allow incoming connections for |compass|.

.. important::

   Ensure ports ``80`` and ``443`` are open between |compass| and the
   host for the MongoDB Instance to which Compass connects.
