  a. Create a file named ``synonyms-equivalent-query.go``. 
  #. Copy and paste the code example into the ``synonyms-equivalent-query.go`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:

     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your |service| cluster.
     - Searches for the word ``automobile`` in the ``title`` field. It 
       includes the following stages: 
       
       - :manual:`$limit </reference/operator/aggregation/limit>` stage 
         to limit the output to 10 results 
       - :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` 
         stage to exclude all fields except ``title`` and add a field 
         named ``score``

     - Iterates over the cursor to print the documents that match the 
       query.

     the following documents to your terminal:
