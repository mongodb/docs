Definition
----------

.. note::

   The following page discusses the :pipeline:`$merge` stage, which
   outputs the aggregation pipeline results to a collection. For a
   discussion of the :expression:`$mergeObjects` operator which merges
   documents into a single document, see :expression:`$mergeObjects`
   instead.

.. pipeline:: $merge

   Writes the results of the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
   </core/aggregation-pipeline>` to a specified collection. The
   :pipeline:`$merge` operator must be the **last** stage in the
   pipeline.

   The :pipeline:`$merge` stage:

   - Can output to a collection in the same or different database.

   - Starting in MongoDB 4.4:

     - :pipeline:`$merge` can output to the
       same collection that is being aggregated. For more
       information, see :ref:`merge-behavior-same-collection`.

     - Pipelines with the :pipeline:`$merge` stage can run on 
       replica set secondary nodes if all the nodes in cluster have 
       :ref:`featureCompatibilityVersion <view-fcv>` set 
       to ``4.4`` or higher and the :doc:`/core/read-preference`
       allows secondary reads. 

       - Read operations of the :pipeline:`$merge` statement are sent to 
         secondary nodes, while the write operations occur only on the 
         primary node.

       - Not all driver versions support targeting of :pipeline:`$merge` 
         operations to replica set secondary nodes. Check your 
         :driver:`driver </>` documentation to see when your driver added
         support for :pipeline:`$merge` read operations running on 
         secondary nodes.

   - Creates a new collection if the output collection does not already
     exist.

   - Can incorporate results (insert new documents, merge documents,
     replace documents, keep existing documents, fail the operation,
     process documents with a custom update pipeline) into an existing
     collection.

   - Can output to a sharded collection. Input collection can
     also be sharded.

   For a comparison with the :pipeline:`$out` stage which also outputs
   the aggregation results to a collection, see
   :ref:`merge-out-comparison`.

.. note:: On-Demand Materialized Views

   :pipeline:`$merge` can incorporate the pipeline results into an
   existing output collection rather than perform a full replacement of
   the collection. This functionality allows users to create on-demand
   materialized views, where the content of the output collection is
   incrementally updated when the pipeline is run.

   For more information on this use case, see
   :doc:`/core/materialized-views` as well as the examples on this page.

   Materialized views are separate from read-only views. For
   information on creating read-only views, see :doc:`read-only views
   </core/views>`.

.. |operator-method| replace:: ``$merge``

.. include:: /includes/fact-compatibility.rst

Syntax
------

:pipeline:`$merge` has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $merge: {
        into: <collection> -or- { db: <db>, coll: <collection> },
        on: <identifier field> -or- [ <identifier field1>, ...],  // Optional
        let: <variables>,                                         // Optional
        whenMatched: <replace|keepExisting|merge|fail|pipeline>,  // Optional
        whenNotMatched: <insert|discard|fail>                     // Optional
   } }

For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $merge: { into: "myOutput", on: "_id", whenMatched: "replace", whenNotMatched: "insert" } }

If using all default options for :pipeline:`$merge` (including writing
to a collection in the same database), you can use the simplified form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $merge: <collection> } // Output collection is in the same database

The :pipeline:`$merge` takes a document with the following fields:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 17 83

  * - Field
    - Description

  * - :ref:`into <merge-into>`

    - ..  _merge-into:

      The output collection. Specify either:

      - The collection name as a string to output to a collection in
        the same database where the aggregation is run. For example:

        | ``into: "myOutput"``
        |

      - The database and collection name in a document to output to a
        collection in the specified database. For example:

        | ``into: { db:"myDB", coll:"myOutput" }``

      .. note::

         - If the output collection does not exist, :pipeline:`$merge`
           creates the collection: 
           
           - For a :ref:`replica set <replica-set>` or a standalone, if
             the output database does not exist, :pipeline:`$merge`
             also creates the database.

           - For a :ref:`sharded cluster <sharded-cluster>`, the
             specified output database must already exist.

         - The output collection can be a sharded collection.

  * - :ref:`on <merge-on>`

    - .. _merge-on:

      Optional. Field or fields that act as a unique identifier for a
      document. The identifier determines if a results document
      :ref:`matches <merge-whenMatched>` an already existing document
      in the output collection. Specify either:

      - A single field name as a string. For example:

        | ``on: "_id"``
        |

      - A combination of fields in an array. For example:

        | ``on: [ "date", "customerId" ]``

        | The order of the fields in the array does not matter, and you
          cannot specify the same field multiple times.

      For the specified field or fields:

      - The aggregation results documents must contain the field(s)
        specified in the ``on``, unless the ``on`` field is the
        ``_id`` field. If the ``_id`` field is missing from a
        results document, MongoDB adds it automatically.

      - The specified field or fields cannot contain a null or an array
        value.

      :pipeline:`$merge` requires a :ref:`unique <index-type-unique>`,
      index with keys that correspond to the :ref:`on
      <merge-on>` identifier fields. Although the order of the index key
      specification does not matter, the unique index must only contain
      the ``on`` fields as its keys.

      - The index must also have the same :doc:`collation
        </reference/collation>` as the aggregation's collation.

      - The unique index can be a :ref:`sparse <index-type-sparse>`
        index.

      - For output collections that already exist, the corresponding
        index must already exist.

      The default value for :ref:`on <merge-on>` depends on the output collection:

      - If the output collection does not exist, the :ref:`on <merge-on>`
        identifier must be and defaults to the ``_id`` field. The
        corresponding unique ``_id`` index is automatically created.

        .. tip::

           To use a different :ref:`on <merge-on>` identifier field(s)
           for a collection that does not exist, you can create the
           collection first by creating a unique index on the desired
           field(s). See the :ref:`section on non-existent output
           collection <merge-use-different-on>` for an example.

      - If the existing output collection is unsharded, the ``on``
        identifier defaults to the ``_id`` field.

      - If the existing output collection is a sharded collection, the
        :ref:`on <merge-on>` identifier defaults to all the shard
        key fields and the ``_id`` field. If specifying a different
        ``on`` identifier, the ``on`` must contain all the shard key
        fields.

  * - :ref:`whenMatched <merge-whenMatched>`

    - .. _merge-whenMatched:

      Optional. The behavior of :pipeline:`$merge` if a result document
      and an existing document in the collection have the same value
      for the specified :ref:`on <merge-on>` field(s).

      You can specify either:

      - One of the pre-defined action strings:

        .. list-table::
           :header-rows: 1
           :widths: 20 80

           * - Action
             - Description

           * - :ref:`"replace" <merge-whenMatched-replace>`

             - ..  _merge-whenMatched-replace:

               Replace the existing document in the :ref:`output
               collection <merge-into>` with the matching results
               document.

               When performing a replace, the replacement document
               cannot result in a modification of the ``_id`` value or,
               if the output collection is sharded, the shard key
               value. Otherwise, the operation results in an error.

               .. tip::
               
                  To avoid this error, if the :ref:`on <merge-on>`
                  field does not include the ``_id`` field, remove the
                  ``_id`` field in the aggregation results to avoid the
                  error, such as with a preceding :pipeline:`$unset`
                  stage, etc.

           * - :ref:`"keepExisting" <merge-whenMatched-keepExisting>`

             - ..  _merge-whenMatched-keepExisting:

               Keep the existing document in the :ref:`output
               collection <merge-into>`.

           * - :ref:`"merge" <merge-whenMatched-merge>` (Default)

             - ..  _merge-whenMatched-merge:

               Merge the matching documents (similar to the
               :expression:`$mergeObjects` operator).

               - If the results document contains fields not in the
                 existing document, add these new fields to the
                 existing document.

               - If the results document contains fields in the existing
                 document, replace the existing field values with those
                 from the results document.

               For example, if the output collection has the document:

               ``{ _id: 1, a: 1, b: 1 }``

               And the aggregation results has the document:

               ``{ _id: 1, b: 5, z: 1 }``

               Then, the merged document is:

               ``{ _id: 1, a: 1, b: 5, z: 1 }``

               When performing a merge, the merged document cannot
               result in a modification of the ``_id`` value or, if the
               output collection is sharded, the shard key value.
               Otherwise, the operation results in an error. 

               .. tip::
               
                  To avoid this error, if the :ref:`on <merge-on>`
                  field does not include the ``_id`` field, remove the
                  ``_id`` field in the aggregation results to avoid the
                  error, such as with a preceding :pipeline:`$unset`
                  stage, etc.

           * - :ref:`"fail" <merge-whenMatched-fail>`

             - ..  _merge-whenMatched-fail:

               Stop and fail the aggregation operation. Any changes to
               the output collection from previous documents are not
               reverted.

      - ..  _merge-whenMatched-pipeline:

        An aggregation pipeline to update the document in the
        collection.

        ``[ <stage1>, <stage2> ... ]``

        The pipeline can only consist of the following stages:

        - :pipeline:`$addFields` and its alias :pipeline:`$set`
        - :pipeline:`$project` and its alias :pipeline:`$unset`
        - :pipeline:`$replaceRoot` and its alias :pipeline:`$replaceWith`

        The pipeline cannot modify the :ref:`on <merge-on>` field's
        value. For example, if you are matching on the field ``month``,
        the pipeline cannot modify the ``month`` field.
        
        The whenMatched ``pipeline`` can directly access the fields of
        the existing documents in the **output** collection using
        ``$<field>``.
        
        To access the fields from the aggregation results documents,
        use either:

        - The built-in ``$$new`` variable to access the field, i.e.
          ``$$new.<field>``. The ``$$new`` variable is only available
          if the :ref:`let <merge-let>` specification is omitted.

          .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-new-variable-reserved.rst

        - The user-defined variables in the :ref:`let <merge-let>`
          field, i.e. ``$$<uservariable>.<field>``.

  * - :ref:`let <merge-let>`

    - .. _merge-let:

      Optional. Specifies variables accessible for use in the
      :ref:`whenMatched pipeline <merge-whenMatched-pipeline>`

      Specify a document with the variable name and value expression:

      ``{ <var_1>: <expression>, ..., <var_n>: <expression> }``

      If unspecified, defaults to ``{ new: "$$ROOT" }``; i.e. the
      :ref:`whenMatched pipeline <merge-whenMatched-pipeline>` can access
      the ``$$new`` variable.

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-new-variable-reserved.rst

      To access the ``let`` variables in the :ref:`whenMatched pipeline
      <merge-whenMatched-pipeline>`, use the double dollar signs ($$)
      prefix and variable name ``$$<variable>``.

  * - :ref:`whenNotMatched <merge-whenNotMatched>`

    - .. _merge-whenNotMatched:

      Optional. The behavior of :pipeline:`$merge` if a result document
      does not match an existing document in the out collection.

      You can specify one of the pre-defined action strings:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 20 80

         * - Action
           - Description

         * - :ref:`"insert" <merge-whenNotMatched-insert>` (Default)

           - ..  _merge-whenNotMatched-insert:

             Insert the document into the output collection.

         * - :ref:`"discard" <merge-whenNotMatched-discard>`

           - ..  _merge-whenNotMatched-discard:

             Discard the document; i.e. :pipeline:`$merge` does not
             insert the document into the output collection.

         * - :ref:`"fail" <merge-whenNotMatched-fail>`

           - ..  _merge-whenNotMatched-fail:

             Stop and fail the aggregation operation. Any changes 
             already written to the output collection are not
             reverted.


.. _aggregation-merge-behavior:

Considerations
--------------

``_id`` Field Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ``_id`` field is not present in a document from the
aggregation pipeline results, the :pipeline:`$merge` stage generates
it automatically.

For example, in the following aggregation pipeline,
:pipeline:`$project` excludes the ``_id`` field from the documents
passed into :pipeline:`$merge`. When :pipeline:`$merge` writes these
documents to the ``"newCollection"``, :pipeline:`$merge` generates a
new ``_id`` field and value.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.sales.aggregate( [
      { $project: { _id: 0 } },  
      { $merge : { into : "newCollection" } }
   ] )

.. _merge-behavior-create-collection:

Create a New Collection if Output Collection is Non-Existent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$merge` operation creates a new collection if the
specified output collection does not exist.

- The output collection is created when :pipeline:`$merge` writes
  the first document into the collection and is immediately visible.

- If the aggregation fails, any writes completed by the
  :pipeline:`$merge` before the error will not be rolled back.

.. note::

   For a :ref:`replica set <replica-set>` or a standalone, if the
   output database does not exist, :pipeline:`$merge` also creates
   the database.

   For a :ref:`sharded cluster <sharded-cluster>`, the specified
   output database must already exist.

.. _merge-use-different-on:

If the output collection does not exist, :pipeline:`$merge` requires
the :ref:`on <merge-on>` identifier to be the ``_id`` field. To use a
different ``on`` field value for a collection that does not exist, you
can create the collection first by creating a unique index on the
desired field(s) first. For example, if the output collection
``newDailySales201905`` does not exist and you want to specify the
``salesDate`` field as the :ref:`on <merge-on>` identifier:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.newDailySales201905.createIndex( { salesDate: 1 }, { unique: true } )

   db.sales.aggregate( [
      { $match: { date: { $gte: new Date("2019-05-01"), $lt: new Date("2019-06-01") } } },
      { $group: { _id: { $dateToString: { format: "%Y-%m-%d", date: "$date" } }, totalqty: { $sum: "$quantity" } } },
      { $project: { _id: 0, salesDate: { $toDate: "$_id" }, totalqty: 1 } },
      { $merge : { into : "newDailySales201905", on: "salesDate" } }
   ] )

Output to a Sharded Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$merge` stage can output to a sharded collection.
When the output collection is sharded, :pipeline:`$merge` uses
the ``_id`` field and all the :ref:`shard key
<sharding-shard-key-creation>` fields as the default :ref:`on
<merge-on>` identifier. If you override the default, the :ref:`on
<merge-on>` identifier must include all the :ref:`shard key
<sharding-shard-key-creation>` fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $merge: { 
      into: "<shardedColl>" or { db:"<sharding enabled db>", coll: "<shardedColl>" },
      on: [ "<shardkeyfield1>", "<shardkeyfield2>",... ], // Shard key fields and any additional fields
      let: <variables>,                                         // Optional
      whenMatched: <replace|keepExisting|merge|fail|pipeline>,  // Optional
      whenNotMatched: <insert|discard|fail>                     // Optional
   } }

For example, in a database that has :method:`sharding enabled
<sh.enableSharding>`, use the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method
to create a new sharded collection ``newrestaurants`` with the
``postcode`` field as the shard key.

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.enableSharding("exampledb");     // Sharding must be enabled in the database
   sh.shardCollection( 
      "exampledb.newrestaurants",      // Namespace of the collection to shard
      { postcode: 1 },                 // Shard key
   );

The ``newrestaurants`` collection will contain documents with
information on new restaurant openings by month (``date`` field) and
postcode (shard key); specifically, the :ref:`on <merge-on>`
identifier is ``["date", "postcode"]`` (the ordering of the fields
does not matter). Because :pipeline:`$merge` requires a unique,
index with keys that correspond to the :ref:`on
<merge-on>` identifier fields, create the unique index
(the ordering of the fields do not matter): [#uniqueoption]_ 

.. code-block:: javascript

   use exampledb
   db.newrestaurants.createIndex( { postcode: 1, date: 1 }, { unique: true } )

With the sharded collection ``restaurants`` and the unique index
created, you can use :pipeline:`$merge` to output the aggregation
results to this collection, matching on ``[ "date", "postcode" ]``
as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use exampledb

   db.openings.aggregate([
      { $group: { 
         _id: { date: { $dateToString: { format: "%Y-%m", date: "$date" } }, postcode: "$postcode" },
         restaurants: { $push: "$restaurantName" } } },
      { $project: { _id: 0, postcode: "$_id.postcode", date: "$_id.date", restaurants: 1 } },
      { $merge: { into: "newrestaurants", "on": [ "date", "postcode" ], whenMatched: "replace", whenNotMatched: "insert" } }
   ])

.. [#uniqueoption]

   The :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method can also create a
   unique index on the shard key when passed the ``{ unique: true
   }`` option if: the shard key is :doc:`range-based
   </core/ranged-sharding>`; the collection is empty; and a unique
   index on the shard key doesn't already exist.

   In the example above, because the ``on`` identifier is the shard
   key and another field, a separate operation to create the
   corresponding index is required.

.. _merge-behavior-replaceCollection:

Replace Documents (``$merge``) vs Replace Collection (``$out``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:pipeline:`$merge` can replace an existing document in the output
collection if the aggregation results contain a document or
documents that match based on the :ref:`on <merge-on>`
specification. As such, :pipeline:`$merge` can replace all documents
in the existing collection if the aggregation results include
matching documents for all existing documents in the collection and
you specify :ref:`"replace" <merge-whenMatched-replace>` for
:ref:`whenMatched <merge-whenMatched>`.

However, **to replace an existing collection** regardless of the
aggregation results, use :pipeline:`$out` instead.

Existing Documents and ``_id`` and Shard Key Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$merge` errors if the :pipeline:`$merge` results in a
change to an existing document's ``_id`` value. 

.. tip::

   To avoid this error, if the :ref:`on <merge-on>` field does not
   include the ``_id`` field, remove the ``_id`` field in the
   aggregation results to avoid the error, such as with a preceding
   :pipeline:`$unset` stage, etc.

Additionally, for a sharded collection, :pipeline:`$merge` also
errors if it results in a change to the shard key value of an
exising document.

Any writes completed by the :pipeline:`$merge` before the error will
not be rolled back.

.. _merge-unique-index-constraints:

Unique Index Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the unique index used by :pipeline:`$merge` for :ref:`on
<merge-on>` field(s) is dropped mid-aggregation, there is no
guarantee that the aggregation will be killed. If the aggregation
continues, there is no guarantee that documents do not have
duplicate ``on`` field values.

If the :pipeline:`$merge` attempts to write a document that violates
any unique index on the output collection, the operation errors; for
example:

- :ref:`Insert a non-matching document
  <merge-whenNotMatched-insert>` that violates a unique index other
  than the index on the :ref:`on <merge-on>` field(s).

- :ref:`Fail <merge-whenMatched-fail>` if there is a matching
  document in the collection. Specifically, the operation attempts
  to insert the matching document which violates the unique index on
  the :ref:`on <merge-on>` field(s).

- :ref:`Replace an existing document
  <merge-whenMatched-replace>` with a new document that
  violates a unique index other than the index on the :ref:`on
  <merge-on>` field(s).

- :ref:`Merge the matching documents <merge-whenMatched-merge>` that
  results in a document that violates a unique index other than the
  index on the :ref:`on <merge-on>` field(s).

``whenMatched`` Pipeline Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2.2, if all of the following are true for a
:pipeline:`$merge` stage:

- The value of :ref:`whenMatched <merge-whenMatched>` is an
  aggregation pipeline,
  
- The value of :ref:`whenNotMatched <merge-whenNotMatched>` is
  ``insert``, and

- There is no match for a document in the output collection,

:pipeline:`$merge` inserts the document directly into the output
collection.

Prior to MongoDB 4.2.2, when these conditions for a
:pipeline:`$merge` stage are met, the pipeline specified in the
:ref:`whenMatched <merge-whenMatched>` field is executed with an
empty input document. The resulting document from the pipeline is
inserted into the output collection.

.. _merge-out-comparison:
   
``$merge`` and ``$out`` Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the introduction of :pipeline:`$merge`, MongoDB provides two
stages, :pipeline:`$merge` and :pipeline:`$out`, for writing the
results of the aggregation pipeline to a collection. The following
summarizes the capabilities of the two stages:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: border-table

   * - :pipeline:`$merge`
     - :pipeline:`$out`

   * - - Can output to a collection in the same or different database.
     - - Can output to a collection in the same or, starting in
         MongoDB 4.4, different database.

   * - - Creates a new collection if the output collection does not
         already exist.

     - - Creates a new collection if the output collection does not
         already exist.

   * - - Can incorporate results (insert new documents, merge
         documents, replace documents, keep existing documents, fail
         the operation, process documents with a custom update pipeline) into
         an existing collection.

         | See also :ref:`merge-behavior-replaceCollection`.

     - - Replaces the output collection completely if it already exists.

   * - - Can output to a sharded collection. Input collection can
         also be sharded.

     - - Cannot output to a sharded collection. Input collection,
         however, can be sharded.

   * - - Corresponds to SQL statements:

         - ``MERGE``.

         - ``INSERT INTO T2 SELECT FROM T1``.

         - ``SELECT INTO T2 FROM T1``.
         
         - Create/Refresh Materialized Views.

     - - Corresponds to SQL statement:

         - ``INSERT INTO T2 SELECT FROM T1``.

         - ``SELECT INTO T2 FROM T1``.

On-Demand Materialized View: Initial Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the output collection does not exist, the :pipeline:`$merge` creates
the collection.

For example, a collection named ``salaries`` in the ``zoo`` database
is populated with the employee salary and department history:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("zoo").salaries.insertMany([
      { "_id" : 1, employee: "Ant", dept: "A", salary: 100000, fiscal_year: 2017 },
      { "_id" : 2, employee: "Bee", dept: "A", salary: 120000, fiscal_year: 2017 },
      { "_id" : 3, employee: "Cat", dept: "Z", salary: 115000, fiscal_year: 2017 },
      { "_id" : 4, employee: "Ant", dept: "A", salary: 115000, fiscal_year: 2018 },
      { "_id" : 5, employee: "Bee", dept: "Z", salary: 145000, fiscal_year: 2018 },
      { "_id" : 6, employee: "Cat", dept: "Z", salary: 135000, fiscal_year: 2018 },
      { "_id" : 7, employee: "Gecko", dept: "A", salary: 100000, fiscal_year: 2018 },
      { "_id" : 8, employee: "Ant", dept: "A", salary: 125000, fiscal_year: 2019 },
      { "_id" : 9, employee: "Bee", dept: "Z", salary: 160000, fiscal_year: 2019 },
      { "_id" : 10, employee: "Cat", dept: "Z", salary: 150000, fiscal_year: 2019 }
   ])

You can use the :pipeline:`$group` and :pipeline:`$merge` stages to
initially create a collection named ``budgets`` (in the ``reporting``
database) from the data currently in the ``salaries`` collection:   

.. note::

   For a replica set or a standalone deployment, if the output
   database does not exist, :pipeline:`$merge` also creates the
   database.

   For a sharded cluster deployment, the specified output database
   must already exist.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("zoo").salaries.aggregate( [
      { $group: { _id: { fiscal_year: "$fiscal_year", dept: "$dept" }, salaries: { $sum: "$salary" } } },
      { $merge : { into: { db: "reporting", coll: "budgets" }, on: "_id",  whenMatched: "replace", whenNotMatched: "insert" } }
   ] )

- :pipeline:`$group` stage to group the salaries by the ``fiscal_year``
  and ``dept``.

- :pipeline:`$merge` stage writes the output of the preceding
  :pipeline:`$group` stage to the ``budgets`` collection in the
  ``reporting`` database.

To view the documents in the new ``budgets`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("reporting").budgets.find().sort( { _id: 1 } )

The ``budgets`` collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2017, "dept" : "A" }, "salaries" : 220000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2017, "dept" : "Z" }, "salaries" : 115000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2018, "dept" : "A" }, "salaries" : 215000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2018, "dept" : "Z" }, "salaries" : 280000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2019, "dept" : "A" }, "salaries" : 125000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2019, "dept" : "Z" }, "salaries" : 310000 }

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/core/materialized-views`

.. _merge-mat-view-refresh:

On-Demand Materialized View: Update/Replace Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example refers to the collections from the previous
example.

The example ``salaries`` collection contains the
employee salary and department history:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, employee: "Ant", dept: "A", salary: 100000, fiscal_year: 2017 },
   { "_id" : 2, employee: "Bee", dept: "A", salary: 120000, fiscal_year: 2017 },
   { "_id" : 3, employee: "Cat", dept: "Z", salary: 115000, fiscal_year: 2017 },
   { "_id" : 4, employee: "Ant", dept: "A", salary: 115000, fiscal_year: 2018 },
   { "_id" : 5, employee: "Bee", dept: "Z", salary: 145000, fiscal_year: 2018 },
   { "_id" : 6, employee: "Cat", dept: "Z", salary: 135000, fiscal_year: 2018 },
   { "_id" : 7, employee: "Gecko", dept: "A", salary: 100000, fiscal_year: 2018 },
   { "_id" : 8, employee: "Ant", dept: "A", salary: 125000, fiscal_year: 2019 },
   { "_id" : 9, employee: "Bee", dept: "Z", salary: 160000, fiscal_year: 2019 },
   { "_id" : 10, employee: "Cat", dept: "Z", salary: 150000, fiscal_year: 2019 }

The example ``budgets`` collection contains the cumulative yearly
budgets:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2017, "dept" : "A" }, "salaries" : 220000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2017, "dept" : "Z" }, "salaries" : 115000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2018, "dept" : "A" }, "salaries" : 215000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2018, "dept" : "Z" }, "salaries" : 280000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2019, "dept" : "A" }, "salaries" : 125000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2019, "dept" : "Z" }, "salaries" : 310000 }

During the current fiscal year (``2019`` in this example), new employees
are added to the ``salaries`` collection and new head counts are
pre-allocated for the next year:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("zoo").salaries.insertMany([
      { "_id" : 11,  employee: "Wren", dept: "Z", salary: 100000, fiscal_year: 2019 },
      { "_id" : 12,  employee: "Zebra", dept: "A", salary: 150000, fiscal_year: 2019 },
      { "_id" : 13,  employee: "headcount1", dept: "Z", salary: 120000, fiscal_year: 2020 },
      { "_id" : 14,  employee: "headcount2", dept: "Z", salary: 120000, fiscal_year: 2020 }
   ])

To update the ``budgets`` collection to reflect the new
salary information, the following aggregation pipeline uses:

- :pipeline:`$match` stage to find all documents with ``fiscal_year``
  greater than or equal to ``2019``.

- :pipeline:`$group` stage to group the salaries by the ``fiscal_year``
  and ``dept``.

- :pipeline:`$merge` to write the result set to the ``budgets``
  collection, :ref:`replacing documents
  <merge-whenMatched-replace>` with the same ``_id`` value (in
  this example, a document with the fiscal year and dept). For
  documents that do not have matches in the collection,
  :pipeline:`$merge` inserts the new documents.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("zoo").salaries.aggregate( [
      { $match : { fiscal_year:  { $gte : 2019 } } },
      { $group: { _id: { fiscal_year: "$fiscal_year", dept: "$dept" }, salaries: { $sum: "$salary" } } },
      { $merge : { into: { db: "reporting", coll: "budgets" }, on: "_id",  whenMatched: "replace", whenNotMatched: "insert" } }
   ] )

After the aggregation is run, view the documents in the ``budgets``
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("reporting").budgets.find().sort( { _id: 1 } )

The ``budgets`` collection incorporates the new salary data for fiscal
year 2019 and adds new documents for fiscal year 2020:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 5-7

   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2017, "dept" : "A" }, "salaries" : 220000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2017, "dept" : "Z" }, "salaries" : 115000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2018, "dept" : "A" }, "salaries" : 215000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2018, "dept" : "Z" }, "salaries" : 280000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2019, "dept" : "A" }, "salaries" : 275000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2019, "dept" : "Z" }, "salaries" : 410000 }
   { "_id" : { "fiscal_year" : 2020, "dept" : "Z" }, "salaries" : 240000 }

.. seealso::

   :doc:`/core/materialized-views`

.. _merge-mat-view-insert-only:

Only Insert New Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure that the :pipeline:`$merge` does not overwrite existing data
in the collection, set :ref:`whenMatched <merge-whenMatched>` to
:ref:`keepExisting <merge-whenMatched-keepExisting>` or :ref:`fail
<merge-whenMatched-fail>`.

The example ``salaries`` collection in the ``zoo`` database contains
the employee salary and department history:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, employee: "Ant", dept: "A", salary: 100000, fiscal_year: 2017 },
   { "_id" : 2, employee: "Bee", dept: "A", salary: 120000, fiscal_year: 2017 },
   { "_id" : 3, employee: "Cat", dept: "Z", salary: 115000, fiscal_year: 2017 },
   { "_id" : 4, employee: "Ant", dept: "A", salary: 115000, fiscal_year: 2018 },
   { "_id" : 5, employee: "Bee", dept: "Z", salary: 145000, fiscal_year: 2018 },
   { "_id" : 6, employee: "Cat", dept: "Z", salary: 135000, fiscal_year: 2018 },
   { "_id" : 7, employee: "Gecko", dept: "A", salary: 100000, fiscal_year: 2018 },
   { "_id" : 8, employee: "Ant", dept: "A", salary: 125000, fiscal_year: 2019 },
   { "_id" : 9, employee: "Bee", dept: "Z", salary: 160000, fiscal_year: 2019 },
   { "_id" : 10, employee: "Cat", dept: "Z", salary: 150000, fiscal_year: 2019 }   

A collection ``orgArchive`` in the ``reporting`` database
contains historical departmental organization records for the past
fiscal years. Archived records should not be modified.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("5cd8c68261baa09e9f3622be"), "employees" : [ "Ant", "Gecko" ], "dept" : "A", "fiscal_year" : 2018 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("5cd8c68261baa09e9f3622bf"), "employees" : [ "Ant", "Bee" ], "dept" : "A", "fiscal_year" : 2017 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("5cd8c68261baa09e9f3622c0"), "employees" : [ "Bee", "Cat" ], "dept" : "Z", "fiscal_year" : 2018 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("5cd8c68261baa09e9f3622c1"), "employees" : [ "Cat" ], "dept" : "Z", "fiscal_year" : 2017 }

The ``orgArchive`` collection has a unique compound index
on the ``fiscal_year`` and ``dept`` fields; i.e. there should be at
most one record for the same fiscal year and department combination:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("reporting").orgArchive.createIndex ( { fiscal_year: 1, dept: 1 }, { unique: true } )

At the end of current fiscal year (``2019`` in this example), the
``salaries`` collection contain the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "employee" : "Ant", "dept" : "A", "salary" : 100000, "fiscal_year" : 2017 }
   { "_id" : 2, "employee" : "Bee", "dept" : "A", "salary" : 120000, "fiscal_year" : 2017 }
   { "_id" : 3, "employee" : "Cat", "dept" : "Z", "salary" : 115000, "fiscal_year" : 2017 }
   { "_id" : 4, "employee" : "Ant", "dept" : "A", "salary" : 115000, "fiscal_year" : 2018 }
   { "_id" : 5, "employee" : "Bee", "dept" : "Z", "salary" : 145000, "fiscal_year" : 2018 }
   { "_id" : 6, "employee" : "Cat", "dept" : "Z", "salary" : 135000, "fiscal_year" : 2018 }
   { "_id" : 7, "employee" : "Gecko", "dept" : "A", "salary" : 100000, "fiscal_year" : 2018 }
   { "_id" : 8, "employee" : "Ant", "dept" : "A", "salary" : 125000, "fiscal_year" : 2019 }
   { "_id" : 9, "employee" : "Bee", "dept" : "Z", "salary" : 160000, "fiscal_year" : 2019 }
   { "_id" : 10, "employee" : "Cat", "dept" : "Z", "salary" : 150000, "fiscal_year" : 2019 }
   { "_id" : 11, "employee" : "Wren", "dept" : "Z", "salary" : 100000, "fiscal_year" : 2019 }
   { "_id" : 12, "employee" : "Zebra", "dept" : "A", "salary" : 150000, "fiscal_year" : 2019 }
   { "_id" : 13, "employee" : "headcount1", "dept" : "Z", "salary" : 120000, "fiscal_year" : 2020 }
   { "_id" : 14, "employee" : "headcount2", "dept" : "Z", "salary" : 120000, "fiscal_year" : 2020 }

To update the ``orgArchive`` collection to include the fiscal
year ``2019`` that has just ended, the following aggregation pipeline
uses:

- :pipeline:`$match` stage to find all documents with ``fiscal_year``
  equal to ``2019``.

- :pipeline:`$group` stage to group the employees by the ``fiscal_year``
  and ``dept``.

- :pipeline:`$project` stage to suppress the ``_id`` field and add
  separate ``dept`` and ``fiscal_year`` field. When the documents
  are passed to :pipeline:`$merge`, :pipeline:`$merge` automatically
  generates a new ``_id`` field for the documents.

- :pipeline:`$merge` to write the result set to ``orgArchive``. 

  The :pipeline:`$merge` stage matches documents :ref:`on
  <merge-on>` the ``dept`` and ``fiscal_year`` fields and ``fails``
  when matched. That is, if a document already exists for the same
  department and fiscal year, the :pipeline:`$merge` errors.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB("zoo").salaries.aggregate( [
       { $match: { fiscal_year: 2019 }},
       { $group: { _id: { fiscal_year: "$fiscal_year", dept: "$dept" }, employees: { $push: "$employee" } } },
       { $project: { _id: 0, dept: "$_id.dept", fiscal_year: "$_id.fiscal_year", employees: 1 } },
       { $merge : { into : { db: "reporting", coll: "orgArchive" }, on: [ "dept", "fiscal_year" ], whenMatched: "fail" } }
   ] )

After the operation, the ``orgArchive`` collection contains the following
documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 3,6

   { "_id" : ObjectId("5caccc6a66b22dd8a8cc419f"), "employees" : [ "Ahn", "Bess" ], "dept" : "A", "fiscal_year" : 2017 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("5caccc6a66b22dd8a8cc419e"), "employees" : [ "Ahn", "Gee" ], "dept" : "A", "fiscal_year" : 2018 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("5caccd0b66b22dd8a8cc438e"), "employees" : [ "Ahn", "Zeb" ], "dept" : "A", "fiscal_year" : 2019 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("5caccc6a66b22dd8a8cc41a0"), "employees" : [ "Carl" ], "dept" : "Z", "fiscal_year" : 2017 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("5caccc6a66b22dd8a8cc41a1"), "employees" : [ "Bess", "Carl" ], "dept" : "Z", "fiscal_year" : 2018 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("5caccd0b66b22dd8a8cc438d"), "employees" : [ "Bess", "Carl", "Wen" ], "dept" : "Z", "fiscal_year" : 2019 }

If the ``orgArchive`` collection already contained a document for
2019 for department ``"A"`` and/or ``"B"``, the aggregation
:ref:`fails because of the duplicate key error
<merge-unique-index-constraints>`. However, any document inserted
before the error will not be rolled back.

If you specify :ref:`keepExisting
<merge-whenMatched-replace>` for the matching document, the
aggregation does not affect the matching document and does not error
with duplicate key error. Similarly, if you specify
:ref:`replace <merge-whenMatched-replace>`, the
operation would not fail; however, the operation would replace the
existing document.

.. _merge-mat-view-merge:

Merge Results from Multiple Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, if a document in the aggregation results matches a
document in the collection, the :pipeline:`$merge` stage
:ref:`merges <merge-whenMatched-merge>` the documents.

An example collection ``purchaseorders`` is populated with the
purchase order information by quarter and regions:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.purchaseorders.insertMany( [
      { _id: 1, quarter: "2019Q1", region: "A", qty: 200, reportDate: new Date("2019-04-01") },
      { _id: 2, quarter: "2019Q1", region: "B", qty: 300, reportDate: new Date("2019-04-01") },
      { _id: 3, quarter: "2019Q1", region: "C", qty: 700, reportDate: new Date("2019-04-01") },
      { _id: 4, quarter: "2019Q2", region: "B", qty: 300, reportDate: new Date("2019-07-01") },
      { _id: 5, quarter: "2019Q2", region: "C", qty: 1000, reportDate: new Date("2019-07-01") },
      { _id: 6, quarter: "2019Q2", region: "A", qty: 400, reportDate: new Date("2019-07-01") },
   ] )

Another example collection ``reportedsales`` is populated with the
reported sales information by quarter and regions:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.reportedsales.insertMany( [
      { _id: 1, quarter: "2019Q1", region: "A", qty: 400, reportDate: new Date("2019-04-02") },
      { _id: 2, quarter: "2019Q1", region: "B", qty: 550, reportDate: new Date("2019-04-02") },
      { _id: 3, quarter: "2019Q1", region: "C", qty: 1000, reportDate: new Date("2019-04-05") },
      { _id: 4, quarter: "2019Q2", region: "B", qty: 500, reportDate: new Date("2019-07-02") },
   ] )


Assume that, for reporting purposes, you want to view the data by
quarter in the following format:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : "2019Q1", "sales" : 1950, "purchased" : 1200 }
   { "_id" : "2019Q2", "sales" : 500, "purchased" : 1700 }

You can use the :pipeline:`$merge` to merge in results from the
``purchaseorders`` collection and the ``reportedsales`` collection
to create a new collection ``quarterlyreport``.

To create the ``quarterlyreport`` collection, you can use the
following pipeline:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.purchaseorders.aggregate( [ 
      { $group: { _id: "$quarter", purchased: { $sum: "$qty" } } },  // group purchase orders by quarter
      { $merge : { into: "quarterlyreport", on: "_id",  whenMatched: "merge", whenNotMatched: "insert" } }
   ])

First stage:
   The :pipeline:`$group` stage groups by the quarter and uses
   :group:`$sum` to add the ``qty`` fields into a new
   ``purchased`` field. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { "_id" : "2019Q2", "purchased" : 1700 }
      { "_id" : "2019Q1", "purchased" : 1200 }

Second stage:
   The :pipeline:`$merge` stage writes the documents to the
   ``quarterlyreport`` collection in the same database. If the stage
   finds an existing document in the collection that :ref:`matches
   on <merge-on>` the ``_id`` field, the stage merges the matching
   documents. Otherwise, the stage inserts the document. For the
   initial creation, no documents should match.

To view the documents in the collection, run the following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.quarterlyreport.find().sort( { _id: 1 } )

The collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : "2019Q1", "sales" : 1200, "purchased" : 1200 }
   { "_id" : "2019Q2", "sales" : 1700, "purchased" : 1700 }

Similarly, run the following aggregation pipeline against the
``reportedsales`` collection to merge the sales results into the
``quarterlyreport`` collection.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.reportedsales.aggregate( [ 
      { $group: { _id: "$quarter", sales: { $sum: "$qty" } } },  // group sales by quarter
      { $merge : { into: "quarterlyreport", on: "_id",  whenMatched: "merge", whenNotMatched: "insert" } }
   ])

First stage:
   The :pipeline:`$group` stage groups by the quarter and uses
   :group:`$sum` to add the ``qty`` fields into a new
   ``sales`` field. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { "_id" : "2019Q2", "sales" : 500 }
      { "_id" : "2019Q1", "sales" : 1950 }

Second stage:
   The :pipeline:`$merge` stage writes the documents to the
   ``quarterlyreport`` collection in the same database. If the stage
   finds an existing document in the collection that :ref:`matches
   on <merge-on>` the ``_id`` field (the quarter), the stage merges
   the matching documents. Otherwise, the stage inserts the document.

To view the documents in the ``quarterlyreport`` collection after
the data has been merged, run the following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.quarterlyreport.find().sort( { _id: 1 } )

The collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : "2019Q1", "sales" : 1950, "purchased" : 1200 }
   { "_id" : "2019Q2", "sales" : 500, "purchased" : 1700 }

Use the Pipeline to Customize the Merge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$merge` can use a :ref:`custom update pipeline
<merge-whenMatched-pipeline>` when documents match. The
:ref:`whenMatched pipeline <merge-whenMatched-pipeline>` can have
the following stages:

- :pipeline:`$addFields` and its alias :pipeline:`$set`
- :pipeline:`$project` and its alias :pipeline:`$unset`
- :pipeline:`$replaceRoot` and its alias :pipeline:`$replaceWith`

An example collection ``votes`` is populated with the daily vote
tally. Create the collection with the following documents:s

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.votes.insertMany([
      { date: new Date("2019-05-01"), "thumbsup" : 1, "thumbsdown" : 1 },
      { date: new Date("2019-05-02"), "thumbsup" : 3, "thumbsdown" : 1 },
      { date: new Date("2019-05-03"), "thumbsup" : 1, "thumbsdown" : 1 },
      { date: new Date("2019-05-04"), "thumbsup" : 2, "thumbsdown" : 2 },
      { date: new Date("2019-05-05"), "thumbsup" : 6, "thumbsdown" : 10 },
      { date: new Date("2019-05-06"), "thumbsup" : 13, "thumbsdown" : 16 }
   ])

Another example collection ``monthlytotals`` has the up-to-date
monthly vote totals. Create the collection with the following
document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.monthlytotals.insertOne({ "_id" : "2019-05", "thumbsup" : 26, "thumbsdown" : 31 } )

At the end of each day, that day's votes is inserted into the
``votes`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.votes.insertOne(
      { date: new Date("2019-05-07"), "thumbsup" : 14, "thumbsdown" : 10 }
   )

You can use :pipeline:`$merge` with an custom pipeline to update the
existing document in the collection ``monthlytotals``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.votes.aggregate([
      { $match: { date: { $gte: new Date("2019-05-07"), $lt: new Date("2019-05-08") } } },
      { $project: { _id: { $dateToString: { format: "%Y-%m", date: "$date" } }, thumbsup: 1, thumbsdown: 1 } },
      { $merge: { 
            into: "monthlytotals", 
            on: "_id",
            whenMatched:  [
               { $addFields: {
                   thumbsup: { $add:[ "$thumbsup", "$$new.thumbsup" ] },
                   thumbsdown: { $add: [ "$thumbsdown", "$$new.thumbsdown" ] }
               } } ],
            whenNotMatched: "insert"
      } }
   ])

First stage:
   The :pipeline:`$match` stage finds the specific day's votes. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { "_id" : ObjectId("5ce6097c436eb7e1203064a6"), "date" : ISODate("2019-05-07T00:00:00Z"), "thumbsup" : 14, "thumbsdown" : 10 }

Second stage:
   The :pipeline:`$project` stage sets the ``_id`` field to a
   year-month string. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { "thumbsup" : 14, "thumbsdown" : 10, "_id" : "2019-05" }
   
Third stage:
   The :pipeline:`$merge` stage writes the documents to the
   ``monthlytotals`` collection in the same database. If the stage
   finds an existing document in the collection that :ref:`matches
   on <merge-on>` the ``_id`` field, the stage uses a pipeline to
   add the ``thumbsup`` votes and the ``thumbsdown`` votes.

   - This pipeline cannot directly accesses the fields from the
     results document. To access the ``thumbsup`` field and the
     ``thumbsdown`` field in the results document, the pipeline uses
     the ``$$new`` variable; i.e. ``$$new.thumbsup`` and
     ``$new.thumbsdown``.

   - This pipeline can directly accesses the ``thumbsup`` field
     and the ``thumbsdown`` field in the existing document in the
     collection; i.e. ``$thumbsup`` and ``$thumbsdown``.

   The resulting document replaces the existing document.

To view documents in the ``monthlytotals`` collection after the merge
operation, run the following operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.monthlytotals.find()

The collection contains the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   { "_id" : "2019-05", "thumbsup" : 40, "thumbsdown" : 41 }
