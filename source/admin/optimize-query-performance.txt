The performance of your {+data-lake+} is affected by the
following factors:

- The structure of your data in |s3| and how you represent it in your
  {+data-lake+} :doc:`configuration file </reference/config-files/data-lake-configuration>`.
- The size of your data files.
- The format and structure of your data files.

Data Structure in |s3|
----------------------

For easier management, make sure that your data is
logically grouped into partitions. You can leverage partitions to
improve {+data-lake-short+} performance by mapping them to partition
attributes in your :doc:`configuration file
</reference/config-files/data-lake-configuration>`.

You can improve your {+data-lake-short+}\'s performance by ensuring that
your partition structure maps to your query patterns and that it is
defined in your :doc:`configuration file
</reference/config-files/data-lake-configuration>`. By mapping your *partition
attributes* (the parts of your |s3| prefix that looks like a folder) to
a query attribute, {+data-lake-short+} can selectively open the files
that contain data related to your query. This both reduces the amount of
time a query takes and decreases cost, since {+data-lake-short+} reads
and downloads less files from |aws|.

.. example::

   Consider an |s3| bucket ``metrics`` with the following structure:

   .. code-block:: text

      metrics
      |--hardware
      |--software
         |--computer
         |--phone
   
   You can set a partition attribute for "metric type" by defining
   ``/metrics/{metric_type string}/*`` in your configuration file. If
   you issue a query that contains ``{metric_type: software}``,
   {+data-lake-short+} only processes the files with the prefix
   ``/software`` and ignores files with the prefix ``/hardware``. 
   
   You can then set a partition attribute for "software type" by
   defining ``/metrics/{metric_type string}/{software_type string}`` in
   your configuration file. If you issue a query that contains
   ``{metric_type: software, software_type: computer}``,
   {+data-lake-short+} ignores files with the prefix ``/phone``.
   
For more information on mapping partition attributes to a collection
:datalakeconf:`~databases.[n].collections.[n].dataSources.[n].path`, see
:ref:`datalake-path-syntax`.

Data File Size
--------------

Each file that {+data-lake-short+} handles requires a certain amount of
compute resources. If your {+data-lake-store+} contains many small data
files, the resources required compound and can reduce performance.
Alternatively, many large data files are problematic as
{+data-lake-short+} then downloads and processes unnecessary data.

For most use cases, a performant file size is **100 to 200 MB**.

Data File Format
----------------

{+data-lake+} supports several :ref:`data file formats
<data-lake-data-formats>`. You can improve performance by compressing
certain file formats or by optimizing file contents for your queries.

Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~

When you compress data files, they take less time to download. Reduced
download time has a greater performance benefit than parsing
uncompressed data.

You can compress the following file formats using `gzip
<https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/manual/gzip.html>`__:

- |json|
- |bson|
- :ref:`CSV <data-lake-csv-tsv-data>` 
- :ref:`TSV <data-lake-csv-tsv-data>` 

File Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Parquet <https://parquet.apache.org/documentation/latest/>`_, `Avro
<https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/>`_, and `ORC
<https://orc.apache.org/docs/>`_ files contain metadata about the file
itself so that an application can traverse the file contents in
different ways. If you structure your data file to align with the
queries you want to run, {+data-lake+} can leverage this metadata to
quickly jump to the right data. 

Of these formats, `Parquet
<https://parquet.apache.org/documentation/latest/>`_ files provide the
best performance and space efficiency for {+data-lake+}, as it is
optimized to parse row and column groups for `Parquet
<https://parquet.apache.org/documentation/latest/>`_.
