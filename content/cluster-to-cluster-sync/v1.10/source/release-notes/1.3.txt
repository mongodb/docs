New Features
-------------

Capped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.3.0, {+c2c-product-name+} supports :ref:`capped
collections <manual-capped-collection>`. For more information, see
:ref:`c2c-capped-collections`.

Disable Index Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.3.0, {+c2c-product-name+} supports disabling non-essential
index builds on the destination cluster.  This can improve migration 
performance, especially with index heavy workloads.

For more information, see :ref:`c2c-api-start`.

Progress Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.3.0, {+c2c-product-name+} includes the ``mongosyncID`` and
``coordinatorID`` in the :ref:`c2c-api-progress` response documents.  This
helps determine whether the ``mongosync`` instance is serving as a coordinator.

Bug Fixes
----------

* Fixes a bug that could cause ``mongosync`` to not copy some documents to the
  destination cluster for clustered collections on replica sets.

Minimum Supported Version
-------------------------

Starting in 1.3.0, the minimum supported version of MongoDB is 6.0.5.
