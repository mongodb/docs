Privilege actions define the operations a user can perform on a :ref:`resource
<resource-document>`. A MongoDB :ref:`privilege <privileges>` comprises a
:ref:`resource <resource-document>` and the permitted actions. This page lists
available actions grouped by common purpose.

MongoDB provides built-in roles with pre-defined pairings of resources and
permitted actions. For lists of the actions granted, see
:doc:`/reference/built-in-roles`. To define custom roles, see
:ref:`create-user-defined-role`.
