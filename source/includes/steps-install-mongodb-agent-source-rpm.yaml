  The data directory stores MongoDB data and must be owned by the

  directory has the ``mongod`` user as owner. If no MongoDB deployment
  exists, create the directory and set the owner.

  The following commands create a data directory and set the owner as
  the ``mongod`` user:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo mkdir /data; sudo chown mongod:mongod /data
