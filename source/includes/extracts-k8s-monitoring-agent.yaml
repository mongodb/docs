  Do Not Deploy Monitoring Agents inside and outside |k8s|
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Do not mix MongoDB deployments outside |k8s| with ones insider |k8s|
  in the same Project.

  Due to |k8s| network translation, a Monitoring Agent outside |k8s|
  cannot monitor MongoDB instnaces inside |k8s|. For this reason, k8s
  and non-k8s deployments in the same Project is not supported. Use
  separate projects.
