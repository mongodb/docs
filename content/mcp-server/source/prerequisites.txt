.. facet::
   :name: genre
   :values: reference

The MCP Server can run Atlas tools that perform various Atlas
operations. To run the Atlas tools, your Atlas cluster requires a
service account with the appropriate permissions. For a list of the
tools, see :ref:`mcp-server-tools`.

About this Task
---------------

Select the permissions to run the MCP Server Atlas tools and create a
service account with those permissions.

Before you Begin
----------------

Select the minimum permissions for the service account.

.. note::

   Granting the :atlas:`Organization Owner
   </reference/user-roles/#mongodb-authrole-Organization-Owner>` role is
   rarely necessary and can be a security risk.

The following table shows the operations you can perform with the MCP
Server and the required roles for those operations:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Operation
     - Safest Role to Assign
     - Level
  
   * - List organizations and projects
     - ``Org Member`` or ``Org Read Only``
     - Organization

   * - Create new projects
     - ``Org Project Creator``
     - Organization

   * - View clusters and databases in a project
     - ``Project Read Only``
     - Project

   * - Create and manage clusters in a project
     - ``Project Cluster Manager``
     - Project

   * - Manage project access lists
     - ``Project IP Access List Admin``
     - Project

   * - Manage database users
     - ``Project Database Access Admin``
     - Project

You should typically use ``Project`` level roles for most operations,
and assign those roles to the specific projects you need to manage or
view. Avoid ``Organization Owner`` unless you require full
administrative control over all projects and settings in the
organization. Write down the permissions you want to use. You'll use
them in the next section.

For a full list of roles and privileges, see :atlas:`Atlas User
Roles </reference/user-roles>`.

.. note::

   The MCP Server doesn't disable or hide tools based on the service
   account permissions. If the service account doesn't have the
   permission to access a tool, trying to run the tool may result in an
   error.

Steps
-----

To create an Atlas service account and allow access to your cluster,
perform these steps:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create Atlas service account

      a. Log in to Atlas at `cloud.mongodb.com
         <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`__.
      #. To access your organization, navigate to **Access Manager** >
         **Organization Access**. The instructions assume you have an
         organization already created.
      #. Click **Add new** > **Application** > **Service Account**.
      #. Enter a name, description, and set an expiration period.
      #. Select the appropriate permissions you selected in the previous
         section.
      #. Click **Create**.

      .. note::

         The Atlas user interface is subject to change and the steps may
         vary.

   .. step:: Save client credentials

      After you create your Atlas service account, you'll see a client
      ID and client secret. Copy and save the client secret because it
      won't be displayed again.
      
      You'll use the client ID and client secret to set the
      ``apiClientId`` and ``apiClientSecret`` in the
      :ref:`mcp-server-configuration-atlas-api-credentials` section
      later.

   .. step:: Add access list entry

      To allow the MCP Server to connect to your Atlas cluster, add an
      access list entry for the IP address of the computer on which the
      MCP Server runs. If you run the MCP Server on your local machine,
      add your local IP address.

      a. Navigate to **Network Access**.
      #. Click **Add IP Address**.
      #. Enter your IP address.

Next Steps
----------

After you create the service account, you can configure the MCP Server
to use the Atlas API credentials. For details, see
:ref:`mcp-server-configuration-atlas-api-credentials`.
