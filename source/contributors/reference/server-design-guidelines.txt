Class Design Guidelines
-----------------------

- Do not use multiple inheritance. If you need the service of
  several classes, use delegation. The only possible but highly
  unlikely exception to this is if your class inherits from other pure
  abstract classes.

- Have a comment before a class that explains its purpose. Perhaps the
  class name is so clear that this is obvious. Then some commentary on
  what you are up to.

- Only add members and methods to a class if they make sense with regards
  to the bullet above. If you find yourself unsure to where to hook a piece
  of logic, rethink the class and surrounding classes' purposes.

- Class names and method names are to be descriptive of what they do.
  Avoid generic overloaded names (e.g., write, add, ...) to make grep
  easier (and maybe reading too).

- Don't put implementation details in the header unless the user of the
  class needs to know them. Sometimes single line inline
  implementations are good "documentation". 

- Be aware than many methods in the codebase can throw a ``DBException``. If a class should never
  throw (e.g. can be called in a destructor), that should be clear.

- Write unit tests for each class you create. If you can't easily
  write a unit test for the class, that is a strong hint it has way too
  many external dependencies.

- Do not create early hierarchies. An early hierarchy is a one where
  there is only one type of derived class. If you need to separate
  functionality, use delegation instead. In that case, make sure to
  test separately.

- Avoid ``friend``.

- When declaring overriding methods in derived classes, use only one of ``final`` or ``override``.
  Do not re-iterate ``virtual``.


- Default to making classes *non-assignable and non-copyable*. Use MONGO_DISALLOW_COPYING().
