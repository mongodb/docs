  a. In the left-side panel of your organization's page, click
     :guilabel:`Live Migration` and choose :guilabel:`Select Cluster for General Live Migration`.

  #. Navigate to the target |service| cluster and click the ellipsis
     :guilabel:`...` button. On the cluster list, the ellipsis
     :guilabel:`...` button appears beneath the cluster name, as shown
     in the following screenshot. When you view a cluster's details,
     the ellipsis :guilabel:`...` appears on the right-hand side of
     the screen, next to the :guilabel:`Connect` and :guilabel:`Configuration` buttons.

        :alt: The ellipsis button is located under the cluster name.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Migrate Data to this Cluster`.

  #. |service| displays a walk-through screen with instructions on
     how to proceed with the live migration. The process
     copies the data from your source cluster to the new target
     cluster. After you complete the walk-through, you can point your
     application to the new cluster.

     You will need the following details for your source cluster to
     facilitate the migration:

     - The hostname and port of the source cluster's
       :manual:`primary member </core/replica-set-primary/>`

     - The username and password used to connect to the source
       cluster

     - If the source cluster uses ``TLS/SSL`` and is not using a
       public Certificate Authority (CA), you will need the
       source cluster's :abbr:`CA (Certificate Authority)` file.

     Prepare the information as stated in the walk-through screen,
     then click :guilabel:`I'm Ready To Migrate`.

  #. |service| displays a walk-through screen that collects information
     required to connect to the source cluster.

     - |service| displays the IP address of the MongoDB
       application server responsible for your live migration at the
       top of the walk-through screen. Configure your source cluster
       firewall to grant access to the displayed IP address.

     - Enter the hostname and port of the primary member of the source cluster
       into the provided text box. For example,
       ``mongoPrimary.example.net:27017``.

     - If the source cluster enforces authentication, enter a username and
       password into the provided text boxes.

       See :ref:`live-import-security` for guidance on the
       user permissions required by |service| live migration.

     - If the source cluster uses ``TLS/SSL``, toggle the ``SSL`` button.

     - If the source replica set uses ``TLS/SSL`` *and* is not using a public
       Certificate Authority (CA), copy the contents of the source cluster's
       :abbr:`CA (Certificate Authority)` file into the provided text box.

     - If you wish to drop all collections on the target cluster
       before beginning the migration process, toggle the switch
       marked :guilabel:`Clear any existing data on your target
       cluster?` to :guilabel:`Yes`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Validate` to confirm that |service| can connect to the
     source replica set.

     If validation fails, check that:

     - You have :ref:`added <live-import-ip-access-list>` |service|
       to the IP access list on your source cluster.

     - The provided user credentials, if any, exist on the source cluster
       and have the required permissions.

     - The :guilabel:`SSL` toggle is enabled only if the source cluster
       requires it.

     - The CA file provided, if any, is valid and correct.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Start Migration` to start the migration process.

     Once the migration process begins, the |service| user interface
     displays the :guilabel:`Migrating Data` walk-through screen for
     the target |service| cluster.

     The walk-through screen updates as the target cluster proceeds
     through the migration process. The migration process includes:

     - Copying collections from the source to the target cluster.
     - Creating indexes on the target cluster.
     - Tailing of oplog entries from the source cluster.

     A lag time value displays during the final oplog tailing phase
     that represents the current lag between the source and target clusters.
     This lag time may fluctuate depending on the rate of oplog generation
     on the source cluster, but should decrease over time as the live
     migration process copies the oplog entries to the target cluster.

     When the lag timer and the :guilabel:`Prepare to Cutover` button turn
     green, proceed to the next step.

   When |service| detects that the source and target clusters are
   nearly in sync, it starts an extendable 120 hour (5 day) timer to begin
   the cutover stage of the live migration procedure. If the 120 hour
   period passes, |service| stops synchronizing with the source cluster.
   You can extend the time remaining by 24 hours by clicking
   :guilabel:`Extend time` below the :guilabel:`<time> left to cut over`
   timer.

   a. Once you are prepared to cut your applications over to the target
      |service| cluster, click :guilabel:`Prepare to Cutover`.
      
   b. |service| displays a walk-through screen with instructions on how to
      proceed with the cutover. These steps are also outlined below:
   
      1. Stop your application. This ensures that no more  writes occur on
         the source cluster.
      
      2. Wait for the optime gap to reach zero. When the counter reaches
         zero, the source and target clusters are in sync.

      3. Restart your application using the new connection string
         provided in step 3 of the live migration cutover user interface.

   #. Once you have completed the cutover stage of the procedure and
      confirm that your application is working with the |service| cluster,
      click :guilabel:`Cut Over` to complete the migration procedure.
      This allows |service| to:

      - Remove the Application Server subnets from the target cluster's
        IP access list.
      - Remove the database user that live migration used to import data
        to the target cluster.
      - Mark the migration process as complete.
