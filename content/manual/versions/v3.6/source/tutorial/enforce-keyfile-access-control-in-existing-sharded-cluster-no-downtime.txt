Overview
--------

.. important::

   The following procedure applies to sharded clusters using MongoDB
   3.4 or later.

   Earlier versions of MongoDB do not support no-downtime upgrade. For
   sharded clusters using earlier versions of MongoDB, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/enforce-keyfile-access-control-in-existing-sharded-cluster`.

A MongoDB sharded cluster can enforce :ref:`user authentication
<authentication>` as well as :ref:`internal authentication
<inter-process-auth>` of its components to secure against unauthorized
access.

The following tutorial describes a procedure using
:setting:`security.transitionToAuth` to transition an existing sharded
cluster to enforce authentication without incurring downtime.

Before you attempt this tutorial, please familiarize yourself with the
contents of this document.

Considerations
--------------

Cloud Manager and Ops Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using Cloud Manager or Ops Manager to manage your deployment,
refer to *Configure Access Control for MongoDB Deployments*
in the :mms-docs:`Cloud Manager manual
</tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials>`
or :opsmgr:`Ops Manager manual
</tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials>` to enforce authentication.

IP Binding
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

.. include:: /includes/fact-default-bind-ip-change.rst

Internal and Client Authentication Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial configures authentication using
:ref:`authentication-scram` for client authentication and a
:ref:`keyfile <internal-auth-keyfile>` for internal authentication.

Refer to the :ref:`authentication` documentation for a complete list of
available client and internal authentication mechanisms.

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial assumes that each shard replica set, as well as the config
server replica set, can elect a new :term:`primary` after stepping down its
existing primary.

A replica set can elect a primary only if both of the following conditions are
true:

- A majority of voting replica set members are available after stepping down
  the :term:`primary`.

- There is at least one available :term:`secondary` member that is not
  :ref:`delayed <replica-set-delayed-members>`, :ref:`hidden
  <replica-set-hidden-members>`, or :ref:`Priority 0
  <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`.

Minimum number of ``mongos`` instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure your sharded cluster has at least two mongos instances
available. This tutorial requires restarting each :binary:`~bin.mongos` in
the cluster. If your sharded cluster has only one :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instance, this results in downtime during the period that the
:binary:`~bin.mongos` is offline.

Enforce Keyfile Access Control on an Existing Sharded Cluster
-------------------------------------------------------------

Create and Distribute the Keyfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/keyfile-intro-sharded-cluster.rst

.. code-block:: shell

   openssl rand -base64 755 > <path-to-keyfile>
   chmod 400 <path-to-keyfile>

.. include:: /includes/extracts/keyfile-distribution-sharded-cluster.rst

For more information on using keyfiles for internal authentication, refer to
:ref:`internal-auth-keyfile`.

.. _security-shardcluster-nodowntime-adminusers-clientusers:

Configure Sharded Cluster Admin User and Client Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` to complete the steps in this
section. The users created in these steps are cluster-level users and
cannot be used for accessing individual shard replica sets.

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-authentication-in-shardcluster-nodowntime-uac.rst

Transition Each ``mongos`` Instance to Enforce Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-authentication-in-shardcluster-nodowntime-transition-mongos.rst

At the end of this section, all :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances in the
sharded cluster are running with :setting:`security.transitionToAuth`
and :setting:`security.keyFile` internal authentication.

Transition Config Server Replica Set Members to Enforce Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-authentication-in-shardcluster-nodowntime-transition-config.rst

At the end of this section, all :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances in the config
server replica set is running with :setting:`security.transitionToAuth` and
:setting:`security.keyFile` internal authentication.

Transition Each Shard Replica Set Members to Enforce Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the shard-local administrator
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In a sharded cluster that enforces authentication, each shard replica
set should have its own :ref:`shard-local administrator
<shard-local-users>`. You cannot use a shard-local administrator for
one shard to access another shard or the sharded cluster.

Connect to the :term:`primary` member of each shard replica set and create a
user with the :method:`db.createUser()` method, assigning it the following
roles:

- :authrole:`clusterAdmin` on the ``admin`` database
- :authrole:`userAdmin` roles on the ``admin`` database

.. code-block:: javascript

   admin = db.getSiblingDB("admin")
   admin.createUser(
     {
       user: "admin",
       pwd: "<password>",
       roles: [
         { role: "clusterAdmin", db: "admin" },
         { role: "userAdmin", db: "admin" }
       ]
     }
   )

At the completion of this tutorial, if you want to connect to the shard
to perform maintenance operation that require direct connection to a
shard, you must authenticate as the shard-local administrator.

.. note::

   Direct connections to a shard should only be for shard-specific
   maintenance and configuration. In general, clients should connect to
   the sharded cluster through the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

Procedure
+++++++++

Transitioning one shard replica set at a time, repeat these steps for
each shard replica set in the sharded cluster.

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-authentication-in-shardcluster-nodowntime-transition-shards.rst

At this point in the tutorial, every component of the sharded cluster is
running with ``--transitionToAuth`` and :setting:`security.keyFile`
internal authentication. The sharded cluster has at least one administrative
user, and each shard replica set has a shard-local administrative user.

The remaining sections involve taking the sharded cluster out of the
transition state to fully enforce authentication.

Restart Each ``mongos`` Instance without ``transitionToAuth``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

  At the end of this section, clients must specify authentication
  credentials to connect to the sharded cluster. Update clients to specify
  authentication credentials *before* completing this section to avoid loss of
  connectivity.

To complete the transition to fully enforcing authentication in the
sharded cluster, you must restart each :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance without
the :setting:`security.transitionToAuth` setting.


.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-authentication-in-shardcluster-nodowntime-auth-mongos.rst

At the end of this section, all :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances enforce client
authentication and :setting:`security.keyFile` internal authentication.

Restart Each Config Server Replica Set Member without ``transitionToAuth``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

  At the end of this step, clients must specify authentication credentials to
  connect to the config server replica set. Update clients to specify
  authentication credentials *before* completing this section to avoid loss of
  connectivity.

To complete the transition to fully enforcing authentication in the
sharded cluster, you must restart each :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance without
the :setting:`security.transitionToAuth` setting.

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-authentication-in-shardcluster-nodowntime-auth-config.rst

At the end of this section, all :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances in the config
server replica set enforce client authentication and
:setting:`security.keyFile` internal authentication.

Restart Each Member in Each Shard Replica Set without ``transitionToAuth``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

  At the end of this step, clients must specify authentication credentials to
  connect to the shard replica set. Update clients to specify authentication
  credentials *before* completing this section to avoid loss of connectivity.

To complete the transition to fully enforcing authentication in the sharded
cluster, you must restart every member of every shard replica set in the
sharded cluster without the :setting:`security.transitionToAuth` setting.

Transitioning one shard replica set at a time, repeat these steps for
each shard replica set in the sharded cluster.

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-authentication-in-shardcluster-nodowntime-auth-shard.rst

At the end of this section, all :binary:`~bin.mongos` and :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances in the sharded cluster enforce client authentication and
:setting:`security.keyFile` internal authentication. Clients can only connect
to the sharded cluster by using the configured client authentication mechanism.
Additional components can only join the cluster by specifying the correct
keyfile.

x.509 Certificate Internal Authentication
-----------------------------------------

MongoDB supports x.509 certificate authentication for use with a secure TLS/SSL
connection. Sharded cluster members and replica set members can use x.509
certificates to verify their membership to the cluster or the replica set
instead of using :ref:`internal-auth-keyfile`.

For details on using x.509 certificates for internal authentication, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-member-authentication`.

:doc:`/tutorial/upgrade-keyfile-to-x509` describes how to upgrade a
deployment's internal auth mechanism from keyfile-based authentication to x.509
certificate-based auth.
