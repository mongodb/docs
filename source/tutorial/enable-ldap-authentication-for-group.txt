`MongoDB Enterprise
<http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise?jmp=docs>`_ provides
support for proxy authentication of users. This allows administrators to
configure a MongoDB cluster to authenticate users by proxying
authentication requests to a specified Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) service.

MongoDB Enterprise for Windows does not include LDAP support for
authentication. However, MongoDB Enterprise for Linux supports using LDAP
authentication with an ActiveDirectory server.

MongoDB does not support LDAP authentication in mixed sharded cluster
deployments that contain both version 2.4 and version 2.6 shards.

The :manual:`Authenticate Using SASL and LDAP with Active Directory
</tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-activedirectory/>` and
:manual:`Authenticate Using SASL and LDAP with OpenLDAP
</tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-openldap>` tutorials in the MongoDB
manual provide more information about setting up LDAP and SASL for
MongoDB. Setting up LDAP and SASL is beyond the scope of this document.

Procedure
---------

This procedure describes how to configure and enable LDAP
authentication when using Automation. If your Monitoring or Backup
agents are **not** managed by |mms|, you must manually configure them to
use LDAP. See:
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-ldap` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-ldap` for instructions.
