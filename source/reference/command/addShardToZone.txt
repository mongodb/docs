Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: addShardToZone

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

    Associates a shard with a :term:`zone`. MongoDB associates this shard with
    the given zone. Chunks that are covered by the zone are assigned to shards
    associated with the zone.

    .. |command| replace:: ``addShardToZone``

    .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand.rst

    You must run :dbcommand:`addShardToZone` on the admin database.

    The :dbcommand:`addShardToZone` command has the following syntax:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       {
         addShardToZone: <string>,
         zone: <string>
       }

    The command takes the following fields:

    .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-addShardToZone-field.rst

    Only issue :dbcommand:`addShardToZone` when connected to a
    :program:`mongos` instance.

    The :program:`mongo` shell provides the helper method
    :method:`sh.addShardToZone()`

Behavior
--------

You can associate a zone with multiple shards, and a shard can associate with
multiple zones.

See the :ref:`zone <zone-sharding>` manual page for more information on zones
in a sharded cluster.

Ranges
~~~~~~

MongoDB effectively ignores zones that do not have at least one range of
shard key values associated with it. 

To associate a range of shard key values with a zone, use the
:dbcommand:`updateZoneKeyRange` database command, or the
:method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()` shell helper.

Security
--------

For sharded clusters running with :ref:`authentication <authentication>`, you
must authenticate as a user whose privileges include :authaction:`update` on
the ``config.shards`` collection or the ``config`` database.

The :authrole:`clusterAdmin` or :authrole:`clusterManager` built-in roles have
the appropriate permissions for issuing :dbcommand:`addShardToZone`. See the
documentation page for :ref:`Role-Based Access Control <authorization>` for
more information.

Example
-------

The following example associates ``shard0000`` with zone ``JFK``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   admin = db.getSiblingDB("admin")
   admin.runCommand( { addShardToZone : "shard0000" , zone : "JFK" } )


A shard can associate with multiple zones. The following example associates
``LGA`` to ``shard0000``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   admin = db.getSiblingDB("admin")
   admin.runCommand( { addShardToZone : "shard0000" , zone : "LGA" } )

``shard0000`` associates with both the ``LGA`` zone and the ``JFK`` zone. In a
balanced cluster, MongoDB routes reads and writes covered by either zone to
``shard0000``.
