  Builds the index in the background so that building an index does
  *not* block other database activities. Specify ``true`` to build in
  the background. The default value is ``false``.

  Creates a unique index so that the collection will not accept
  insertion of documents where the index key or keys match an existing
  value in the index. Specify ``true`` to create a unique index. The
  default value is ``false``.

  The option is *unavailable* for :doc:`hashed </core/index-hashed>`
  indexes.

  The name of the index. If unspecified, MongoDB generates an index name
  by concatenating the names of the indexed fields and the sort order.

  Whether user specified or MongoDB generated, index names including
  their full namespace (i.e. ``database.collection``) cannot be longer
  than the :limit:`Index Name Limit <Index Name Length>`.

  If ``true``, the index only references documents with the specified
  field. These indexes use less space but behave differently in some
  situations (particularly sorts). The default value is ``false``.
  See :doc:`/core/index-sparse` for more information.

  .. versionchanged:: 2.6

     :doc:`2dsphere </core/2dsphere>` indexes are sparse by default and
     ignore this option. For a compound index that includes
     ``2dsphere`` index key(s) along with keys of other types, only the
     ``2dsphere`` index fields determine whether the index references a
     document.

     :doc:`2d </core/2d>`, :doc:`geoHaystack </core/geohaystack>`, and
     :doc:`text </core/index-text>` indexes behave similarly to the
     :doc:`2dsphere </core/2dsphere>` indexes.

  Specifies a value, in seconds, as a :term:`TTL` to control how long
  MongoDB retains documents in this collection. See
  :doc:`/tutorial/expire-data` for more information on this
  functionality. This applies only to :term:`TTL` indexes.

  The index version number. The default index version depends on the
  version of :binary:`~bin.mongod` running when creating the index. Before
  version 2.0, the this value was 0; versions 2.0 and later use version
  1, which provides a smaller and faster index format. Specify a
  different index version *only* in unusual situations.

name: v

  Allows users to specify configuration to the storage engine on a
  per-index basis when creating an index. The value of the
  ``storageEngine`` option should take the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { <storage-engine-name>: <options> }

  Storage engine configuration specified when creating indexes are
  validated and logged to the :term:`oplog` during replication to
  support replica sets with members that use different storage
  engines.

  .. versionadded:: 3.0

name: storageEngine
operation: db.collection.createIndex
optional: true
type: document
