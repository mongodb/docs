MMAPv1 Storage Engine

MMAPv1 is MongoDB's original storage engine based on memory mapped
files. It excels at workloads with high volume inserts, reads, and
in-place updates.

.. include:: /includes/fact-mmapv1-big-endian.rst

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

   Starting in MongoDB 3.2, the MMAPv1 is no longer the default storage
   engine; instead, the :doc:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>` storage
   engine is the default storage engine . See
   :ref:`3.2-storage-engine-compatibility`.

Journal
-------

In order to ensure that all modifications to a MongoDB data set are
durably written to disk, MongoDB, by default, records all modifications
to an on-disk journal. MongoDB writes more frequently to the journal
than it writes the data files.

.. include:: /includes/fact-mmapv1-write-to-disk.rst

The journal allows MongoDB to successfully recover data from data files
after a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance exits without flushing all changes.
See :doc:`/core/journaling` for more information about the journal in
MongoDB.

Record Storage Characteristics
------------------------------

All records are contiguously located on disk, and when a document
becomes larger than the allocated record, MongoDB must allocate a new
record. New allocations require MongoDB to move a document and update
all indexes that refer to the document, which takes more time than
in-place updates and leads to storage
fragmentation.

.. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

By default, MongoDB uses :ref:`power-of-2-allocation` so that every
document in MongoDB is stored in a *record* which contains the document
itself and extra space, or :term:`padding`. Padding allows the document
to grow as the result of updates while minimizing the likelihood of
reallocations.

.. _record-allocation-strategies:

Record Allocation Strategies
----------------------------

MongoDB supports multiple record allocation strategies that determine
how :binary:`~bin.mongod` adds padding to a document when creating a
record. Because documents in MongoDB may grow after insertion
and all records are contiguous on disk, the padding can reduce the
need to relocate documents on disk following updates. Relocations are
less efficient than in-place updates and can lead to storage
fragmentation. As a result, all padding strategies trade additional
space for increased efficiency and decreased fragmentation.

Different allocation strategies support different kinds of workloads:
the :ref:`power of 2 allocations <power-of-2-allocation>` are more
efficient for insert/update/delete workloads; while :ref:`exact fit
allocations <exact-fit-allocation>` is ideal for collections *without*
update and delete workloads.

.. _power-of-2-allocation:

Power of 2 Sized Allocations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

MongoDB 3.0 uses the power of 2 sizes allocation as the default record
allocation strategy for MMAPv1. With the power of 2 sizes allocation
strategy, each record has a size in bytes that is a power of 2 (e.g.
32, 64, 128, 256, 512 ... 2 MB). For documents larger than 2 MB, the
allocation is rounded up to the nearest multiple of 2 MB.

The power of 2 sizes allocation strategy has the following key
properties:

- Can efficiently reuse freed records to reduce fragmentation.
  Quantizing record allocation sizes into a fixed set of sizes
  increases the probability that an insert will fit into the free space
  created by an earlier document deletion or relocation.

- Can reduce moves. The added padding space gives a document room to
  grow without requiring a move. In addition to saving the cost of
  moving, this results in less updates to indexes. Although the power
  of 2 sizes strategy can minimize moves, it does not eliminate them
  entirely.

.. _exact-fit-allocation:

No Padding Allocation Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.0.0

For collections whose workloads do not change the document sizes, such
as workloads that consist of insert-only operations or update
operations that do not increase document size (such as incrementing a
counter), you can disable the :ref:`power of 2 allocation
<power-of-2-allocation>` using the :dbcommand:`collMod` command with
the :collflag:`noPadding` flag or the :method:`db.createCollection()`
method with the ``noPadding`` option.

Prior to version 3.0.0, MongoDB used an allocation strategy that
included a dynamically calculated :data:`padding
<collStats.paddingFactor>` as a factor of the document size.

.. _mmapv1-RAM:

Memory Use
----------

With MMAPv1, MongoDB automatically uses all free memory on the machine
as its cache. System resource monitors show that MongoDB uses a lot of
memory, but its usage is dynamic. If another process suddenly needs
half the server's RAM, MongoDB will yield cached memory to the other
process.

Technically, the operating system's virtual memory subsystem manages
MongoDB's memory. This means that MongoDB will use as much free memory
as it can, swapping to disk as needed. Deployments with enough memory
to fit the application's working data set in RAM will achieve the best
performance.
