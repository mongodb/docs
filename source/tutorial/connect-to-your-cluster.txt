You can connect to your cluster in a variety of ways. In this tutorial, 
you use one of the following methods:

- :mdb-shell:`The MongoDB Shell </>`, an interactive
  command line interface to MongoDB. You can use {+mongosh+}
  to insert and interact with data on your |service|
  cluster.

- :compass:`MongoDB Compass </>`, a GUI for your MongoDB data. You 
  can use Compass to explore, modify, and visualize your data.

- :driver:`A MongoDB driver </>` to communicate with your MongoDB
  database programmatically. To see all supported languages, 
  refer to the :driver:`MongoDB Driver documentation </>`.

.. |arrow| unicode:: U+27A4
   
|arrow| Use the **Select your language** drop-down menu to set the 
connection method for this tutorial.

.. note::

   If you're using the ``atlas setup`` or ``atlas quickstart`` commands
   with default options to get started with |service|, the {+atlas-cli+} 
   provides you with a {+mongosh+} command to connect to your cluster.

.. _gswa-prerequisites:

Required Access
---------------

To connect to a cluster, you must be a :ref:`database user <gswa-user>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you start, verify that you have:

- :ref:`An Atlas account <atlas-register-account>`.
- :ref:`An organization with a project <atlas-organization-project>`.
- :doc:`An active cluster created in your account </tutorial/deploy-free-tier-cluster>`.
- :ref:`An IP address added to your IP access list <gswa-access-list>`.
- :ref:`A database user on your cluster <gswa-user>`.
 
  .. note::

     You must have a database user set up on your cluster to access your
     deployment. For security purposes, |service| requires clients to
     authenticate as database users to access clusters.

.. _connect-to-your-cluster:

Connect to Your Atlas Cluster
-----------------------------

In this section, you get your cluster's :manual:`connection string 
</reference/connection-string>` from the {+atlas-ui+} and connect 
to your cluster by using your preferred connection method.

To learn about all supported methods, see 
:ref:`connect-to-database-deployment`. For additional driver examples, 
see :ref:`connect-via-driver`.
