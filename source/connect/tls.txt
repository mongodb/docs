Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the :wikipedia:`TLS <Transport_Layer_Security>`
protocol to secure your connection to a MongoDB deployment.

When you enable TLS for a connection, the {+library-short+} performs the following actions:

- Uses TLS to connect to the MongoDB deployment
- Verifies the deployment's certificate
- Ensures that the certificate certifies the deployment

To learn how to configure your MongoDB deployment for TLS, see the
:manual:`TLS configuration guide </tutorial/configure-ssl/>` in the
{+mdb-server+} manual. 

.. note::

   This page assumes prior knowledge of TLS/SSL and access to valid certificates.
   A full description of TLS/SSL, PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) certificates, and
   Certificate Authorities (CAs) is beyond the scope of this documentation. 

.. tip::

   The {+library-short+} delegates most TLS behavior to the MongoDB C Driver.
   For information about how the C driver handles TLS, including configuration steps
   and expected behavior, see
   `Configuring TLS <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/c/c-driver/current/libmongoc/guides/configuring_tls/#supported-libraries>`__
   in the C driver Documentation.

.. _php-enable-tls:

Enable TLS
----------

To enable TLS for the connection to your MongoDB deployment, set the ``tls`` connection
option to ``true``. You can do this in two ways: by using the ``uriOptions`` parameter
of the ``MongoDB\Client`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. include:: /includes/connect/tls-tabs.rst

.. tip::
   
   If your connection string includes the ``+srv`` modification, which specifies the
   SRV connection format, TLS is enabled on your connection by default.

   To learn more about the SRV connection format, see
   :manual:`SRV Connection Format </reference/connection-string/#srv-connection-format>`
   in the {+mdb-server+} documentation.

.. _php-specify-ca-file:

Specify a CA File
------------------

During the TLS handshake, the MongoDB deployment presents a certificate key file to your
application to establish its identity. Usually, a deployment's certificate has been
signed by a well-known CA (certificate authority), and your application relies on this CA
to validate the certificate.

During testing, however, you might want to act as your own CA.
In this case, you must instruct the {+library-short+} to
use your CA certificates instead of ones signed by another CA.

To do so, use the ``tlsCAFile`` connection option to specify the path to a ``.pem`` file
containing the root certificate chain.
You can do this in two ways: by using the ``uriOptions`` parameter
of the ``MongoDB\Client`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. include:: /includes/connect/ca-file-tabs.rst

.. _php-specify-ca-directory:

Specify a CA Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using OpenSSL or LibreSSL (``libtls``) for TLS support, you can also use
the ``ca_dir`` option to instruct
the {+library-short+} to search for a CA file within a directory. The driver searches this
directory if it doesn't find a CA file at the path specified in the ``tlsCAFile`` option.
 
The following code example shows how to use the ``driverOptions`` parameter to specify the
``ca_dir`` option:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/ca-dir.php
      :language: php
      :copyable: true

.. tip:: 
   
   This option corresponds to the OpenSSL
   `SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations <https://linux.die.net/man/3/ssl_ctx_load_verify_locations>`__
   parameter and
   the LibreSSL `tls_config_set_ca_path <https://man.openbsd.org/tls_load_file.3>`__
   parameter.

.. _php-certificate-revocation:

Check Certificate Revocation
----------------------------

When an X.509 certificate is no longer trustworthy—for example, if its private key
has been compromised—the CA revokes the certificate. The {+library-short+} includes two ways
to check whether a server's certificate has been revoked.

.. _php-disable-ocsp:

OCSP
~~~~

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) process specifies that the
server staples a time-stamped OCSP response to its certificate. The
{+library-short+} validates the certificate against the OCSP response.
If the CA has revoked the certificate, or if the OCSP response is
otherwise invalid, the TLS handshake fails.

To stop the {+library-short+} from contacting the OCSP endpoint, set the
``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` connection option to ``true``.
You can do this in two ways: by passing an argument to the
``MongoDB\Client`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. include:: /includes/connect/ocsp-tabs.rst

.. note::

   Even if the ``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` option is set to ``true``, the {+library-short+}
   still verifies any OCSP response stapled to a server's certificate.

.. _php-crl:

Certificate Revocation List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of using OCSP, you can use the instruct the {+library-short+}
to check the server's certificate
against a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) published by the CA. To do so, set the
``crl_file`` option to the file path of the CRL. Include this option in the
``driverOptions`` parameter of the ``MongoDB\Client`` constructor, as shown
in the following code example: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/crl-file.php
      :language: php
      :copyable: true

.. tip::

   You can specify a CRL file in either the ``.pem`` or ``.der`` format.

.. _php-client-cert:

Present a Client Certificate
----------------------------

Some MongoDB deployments require every connecting application to present a client certificate
that proves its identity. To specify the client certificate for the {+library-short+} to
present, set the ``tleCertificateKeyFile`` option to the file path of the ``.pem`` file that
contains your certificate and private key.

You can do this in two ways: by using the ``uriOptions`` parameter
of the ``MongoDB\Client`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. include:: /includes/connect/client-cert-tabs.rst

.. important::
   
   Your client certificate and private key must be in the same ``.pem`` file. If they
   are stored in different files, you must concatenate them. The following example
   shows how to concatenate a key file and a certificate file into a third file called
   ``combined.pem`` on a Unix system: 

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ cat key.pem cert.pem > combined.pem

.. _php-key-file-password:

Provide a Key Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the private key in your certificate file is encrypted, you must use the
``tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword`` option to provide the password.
You can do this in two ways: by using the ``uriOptions`` parameter
of the ``MongoDB\Client`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. include:: /includes/connect/key-file-password.rst

.. _php-insecure-tls:

Allow Insecure TLS
------------------

When TLS is enabled, the {+library-short+} automatically verifies the certificate that
the server presents. When testing your code, you can disable this verification.
This is known as *insecure TLS.*

When insecure TLS is enabled, the driver requires only that the server present an
X.509 certificate. The driver accepts a certificate even if any of the following are
true: 

- The hostname of the server and the subject name (or subject alternative name) 
  on the certificate don't match.
- The certificate is expired or not yet valid. 
- The certificate doesn't have a trusted root certificate in the chain. 
- The certificate purpose isn't valid for server identification.

.. note::

   Even when insecure TLS is enabled, communication between the client and server
   is encrypted with TLS.

To enable insecure TLS, set the ``tlsInsecure`` connection
option to ``true``. You can do this in two ways: by passing an argument to the
``MongoDB\Client`` constructor or through a parameter in your connection string.

.. include:: /includes/connect/insecure-tls-tabs.rst

To disable only certificate validation, set the ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` option to
``true``, and set the ``tlsInsecure`` option to ``false`` or omit it:

.. include:: /includes/connect/disable-cert-validation-tabs.rst

To disable only hostname verification, set the ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`` option to
``true``, and set the ``tlsInsecure`` option to ``false`` or omit it:

.. include:: /includes/connect/disable-host-verification-tabs.rst

.. warning:: Don't Use in Production

   Always set the ``tlsInsecure``, ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates``, and
   ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`` options to ``false`` in production.
   
   Setting any of these options to ``true`` in a production environment makes
   your application insecure and potentially
   vulnerable to expired certificates and to foreign processes posing
   as valid client instances.
