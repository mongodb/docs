             For the "global" roles (those whose name starts
             with ``GLOBAL_``) there is no ``groupId`` since these
             roles are not tied to a group.

      * - ``roles.roleName``

        - string

        - The name of the role. Possible values are:

          .. only:: cloud

             .. note::

                The ``users`` resource returns all the roles the user
                has in both |mms| and |service|.
