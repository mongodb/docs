This quick start relies on the following services, tools, and their documentation:

- |k8s| clusters. This quick start uses |gke| to provision multiple |k8s|
  clusters. Each |k8s| member cluster hosts a MongoDB replica set deployment
  and represents a data center that serves your application.

- :github:`MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator repository
  </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes>` with configuration files that
  the |k8s-op-short| needs to deploy a |k8s| cluster.

- :mdb-github:`MongoDB Helm Charts for Kubernetes </helm-charts>` with
  charts for |multi-clusters|.

- |istio| service mesh. This quick start uses |istio| to facilitate
  `DNS resolution <https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/configuration/traffic-management/dns-proxy/>`__
  for MongoDB replica sets deployed in different |k8s| clusters. You can
  use another service mesh solution as long as you ensure that
  cross-cluster service FQDNs are resolvable.

- Documentation from |istio| to `Install Multicluster <https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/>`__.

- :github:`install_istio_separate_network script </mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/blob/master/tools/multicluster/install_istio_separate_network.sh>`
  that is based on Istio documentation and provides an example
  installation that uses the `multi-primary mode on different networks
  <https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/multi-primary_multi-network/>`__.
  If you use another service mesh solution, create your own script for
  configuring separate networks to facilitate DNS resolution.

- :ref:`Multi-cluster CLI <multi-cluster-cli-reference-ref>` that sets up
  |multi-clusters| and allows you to run automatic and manual
  :ref:`disaster recovery <disaster-recovery-ref>`. To learn more,
  see :ref:`multi-cluster-cli-reference-ref`.
