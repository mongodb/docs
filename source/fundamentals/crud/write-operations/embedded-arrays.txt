===========================
Update Arrays in a Document
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

If you need to modify an array embedded within a document, you can use an
array update operator in your update method call. In this guide, we
explain and show examples on usage of these operators including:

- :ref:`First array element match positional operator <first-match-operator>`: ``$``
- :ref:`All array element match operator <all-match-operator>`: ``$[]``
- :ref:`Filtered positional operator <filtered-positional-operator>`: ``$[<identifier>]``

See the MongoDB server guide on
:manual:`Update Operators </reference/operator/update-array/#update-operators>`
for a complete list.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

The following examples use a database called ``test`` and collection
called ``pizza`` which contains documents that describe customers and
their pizza shop orders as array elements in field called ``items``. Use
the following sample document to follow the example queries:

.. code-block:: javascript

   [{
      name: "Steve Lobsters",
      address: "731 Yexington Avenue",
      items: [
        {
          type: "beverage",
          name: "Water",
          size: "17oz"
        },
        {
          type: "pizza",
          size: "large",
          toppings: ["pepperoni"],
        },
        {
          type: "pizza",
          size: "medium",
          toppings: ["mushrooms", "sausage", "green peppers"],
          comment: "Extra green peppers please!",
        },
        {
          type: "pizza",
          size: "large",
          toppings: ["pineapple, ham"],
          comment: "red pepper flakes on top",
        },
        {
          type: "calzone",
          fillings: ["canadian bacon", "sausage", "onion"],
        },
        {
          type: "beverage",
          name: "Diet Pepsi",
          size: "16oz",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      name: "Popeye",
      address: "1 Sweethaven",
      items: [
        {
          type: "pizza",
          size: "large",
          toppings: ["garlic, spinach"],
        },
        {
          type: "calzone",
          toppings: ["ham"],
        },
      ],
    }]


.. _first-match-operator:

Match the First Array Element
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform the update on only the first array element of each document
that matches your query document in your update operation, use the ``$``
positional array update operator. This update operator references the array
matched by the query filter and cannot be used to reference an array nested
within that array. For cases in which you need to access the nested arrays,
use the :ref:`filtered positional operator <filtered-positional-operator>`.

The following code snippet shows how you can use the ``$`` array update
operator to update the size of the first pizza order item to "extra large"
for the customer named "Steve Lobsters".

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/arrayFilters.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start firstArrayElement example
   :end-before: end firstArrayElement example
   :dedent: 4

Once the update operation is run, the document contains the new value for
size for the first item:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     name: "Steve Lobsters",
     ...
     items: [
       {
         type: "pizza",
         size: "extra large",
         ...
   }

The query filter matches all documents that contain an element embedded in
the ``items`` array that contain a value of ``pizza`` in the ``type`` field.
The ``updateDocument`` specifies the update operation should set the
first array element match in ``items`` to "extra large".

Note that we included both ``name`` and ``items.type`` fields in the query
filter in order to match the array in which we apply the ``$`` operator. If we
omit the ``items.type`` field from the query and specify the ``$`` operator
in our update, we encounter the following error:

.. code-block:: none

   The positional operator did not find the match needed from the query.

.. warning::

   Do not use the ``$`` operator in an ``upsert`` call because the ``$``
   is treated as a field name in the insert document.

.. _all-match-operator:

Match All Array Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform the update on all of the array elements of each document that
matches your query document in your update operation, use the all
positional operator, ``$[]``.

The following code snippet shows how you can use the ``$[]`` array update
operator to add "fresh mozzarella" to the toppings of all of Popeye's
order items.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/arrayFilters.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start allArrayElement example
   :end-before: end allArrayElement example
   :dedent: 4

After you run the update method, your customer document for "Popeye" should
resemble the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "name":"Popeye",
     ...
     "items": [
       {
         "type": "pizza",
         ...
         "toppings": ["garlic", "spinach", "fresh mozzarella"],
       },
       {
         "type": "calzone",
         ...
         "toppings":["ham", "fresh mozzarella"],
       },
     ]
   }

.. _filtered-positional-operator:

Filtered Positional Operator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the previous sections, we used the ``$`` operator to match the first
array element and the ``$[]`` operator to match all array elements. In this
section, we use the filtered positional operator to match all embedded
array elements that match our specified criteria.

The filtered positional operator, denoted by ``$[<identifier>]``,
specifies the matching array elements in the update document. This
operator is paired with query filters in an ``arrayFilters`` object in
your update operation's ``options`` parameter to identify which array
elements to match.

The ``<identifier>`` term is a placeholder value you designate that represents
an element of the array field name that prefixes it. For example, to add a
"garlic" topping to certain order items using this operator, format your
update document as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $push: { items.$[orderItem].toppings: "garlic" } }

.. note::

   The <identifier> placeholder name must start with lowercase and contain
   only alphanumeric characters.

This update document specifies the following:

- ``$push``: the update operator
- ``items``: the array in the document to update
- ``orderItem``: the identifier for the filtered positional operator
- ``toppings``: the field on the ``items`` array element to update
- ``garlic``: the value to push onto the ``toppings`` array

Next, add the matching criteria in your ``arrayFilters`` object in your update
operation's ``options`` parameter. This object is an array of query filters
that specify which array elements to include in the update. To add the
"garlic" topping to order items of type "pizza" and "large size", pass the
following ``arrayFilters``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   arrayFilters: [
     { orderItem.type: "pizza" },
     { orderItem.size: "large" }
   ]

The following snippet shows the complete update method for this example:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/arrayFilters.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start arrayFiltersOne example
   :end-before: end arrayFiltersOne example
   :dedent: 4

After we run the method above, all of the large pizza order items for
customer "Steve Lobsters" now contain "garlic" in the ``toppings`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     name: "Steve Lobsters",
     ...
     items: [
       {
         type: "pizza",
         size: "large",
         toppings: ["pepperoni", "garlic"]
       },
       {
         type: "pizza",
         size: "large",
         toppings: ["pineapple", "ham", "garlic"]
         ...
   }

Let's run through another example. Suppose "Steve Lobsters" wants to
adjust their order to add "salami" as a topping to *only* the large
pepperoni pizza, you can use the filtered positional operator to perform
the update as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/arrayFilters.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start arrayFiltersTwo example
   :end-before: end arrayFiltersTwo example
   :dedent: 4

After we run the update method, the document resembles the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     name: "Steve Lobsters",
     address: "731 Yexington Avenue",
     items: [
       {
         type: "pizza",
         size: "large",
         toppings: ["pepperoni", "salami"],
       },
       {
         type: "pizza",
         size: "medium",
         toppings: ["mushrooms", "sausage", "green peppers"],
         comment: "Extra green peppers please!",
       },
       {
         type: "pizza",
         size: "large",
         toppings: ["pineapple, ham"],
         comment: "red pepper flakes on top",
       },
       {
         type: "calzone",
         fillings: ["canadian bacon", "sausage", "onion"],
       },
       {
         type: "beverage",
         name: "Diet Pepsi",
         size: "16oz",
       },
     ],
   }
