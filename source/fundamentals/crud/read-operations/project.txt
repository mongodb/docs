Overview
--------

Use a projection to control which fields appear in the documents
returned by read operations. Many requests only require certain fields,
so projections can help you limit unnecessary network bandwidth usage.
Projections work in two ways:

- Explicitly include fields with a value of ``1``. This has the
  side-effect of implicitly excluding all unspecified fields.

- Implicitly exclude fields with a value of ``0``. This has the
  side-effect of implicitly including all unspecified fields.

These two methods of projection are mutually exclusive: if you
explicitly include fields, you cannot explicitly exclude fields, and
vice versa.

Sample Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To follow the examples in this guide, use the following code snippet to insert documents
that describe fruits into the ``myDB.fruits`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const myDB = client.db("myDB");
   const myColl = myDB.collection("fruits");

   await myColl.insertMany([
     { "_id": 1, "name": "apples", "qty": 5, "rating": 3 },
     { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas", "qty": 7, "rating": 1 },
     { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges", "qty": 6, "rating": 2 },
     { "_id": 4, "name": "avocados", "qty": 3, "rating": 5 },
   ]);

.. include:: /includes/access-cursor-note.rst

Single Field
------------

In the following query, pass the projection to only return the ``name``
field of each document:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   // return only* the name field
   const projection = { name: 1 };
   const cursor = myColl.find().project(projection);
   for await (const doc of cursor) {
     console.dir(doc);
   }

The projection document specifies a value of ``1`` for ``name``. This instructs
the operation to *include* the ``name`` field of each returned document in
the results and *exclude* the ``qty`` and ``rating`` fields. Passing this projection
to ``find()`` with an empty query document and no sort document yields the following
results:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": 1, "name": "apples" }
   { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas" }
   { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges" }
   { "_id": 4, "name": "avocados" }

Although this projection only explicitly included the ``name`` field, the query returned
the ``_id`` field as well.

The ``_id`` field is a special case because it is always included in every query unless
explicitly specified otherwise. This is because ``_id`` is a unique identifier for each
document, a property that is often used when constructing queries. The ``movies``
collection data demonstrates why this property is necessary: two or more movies can share
the same title, such as movie remakes. Because of this, you need a unique ``_id`` value to
reliably reference a specific movie. ``_id`` is the only exception to the mutually
exclusive include-exclude behavior in projections: you *can* explicitly exclude ``_id``
even when explicitly including other fields if you do not want ``_id`` to be present in
returned documents.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   // return only the name field
   const projection = { _id: 0, name: 1 };
   const cursor = myColl.find().project(projection);
   for await (const doc of cursor) {
     console.dir(doc);
   }

The projection document specifies a value of ``1`` for ``name`` and ``0`` for 
``_id``. This instructs the operation to *include* the ``name`` field of each
returned document in the results and *exclude* the ``_id``, ``qty``, and ``rating``
fields. Passing this projection to ``find()`` with an empty query document and
no sort document yields the following results:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "name": "apples" }
   { "name": "bananas" }
   { "name": "oranges" }
   { "name": "avocados" }

Multiple Fields
---------------

You can also specify multiple fields to include in your projection. Note: the
order in which you specify the fields in the projection does not alter the
order in which they are returned.

.. code-block:: javascript

   const projection = { _id: 0, rating: 1, name: 1 };
   const cursor = myColl.find().project(projection);
   for await (const doc of cursor) {
     console.dir(doc);
   }

This example that identifies two fields to include in the projection yields
the following results:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

     { "name": "apples", "rating": 3 }
     { "name": "bananas", "rating": 1 }
     { "name": "oranges", "rating": 2 }
     { "name": "avocados", "rating": 5 }
