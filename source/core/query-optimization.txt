==================
Query Optimization
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Indexes improve the efficiency of read operations by reducing the
amount of data that query operations need to process. This simplifies
the work associated with fulfilling queries within MongoDB.

Create an Index to Support Read Operations
------------------------------------------

If your application queries a collection on a particular field or
fields, then an index on the queried field or fields can prevent the
query from scanning the whole collection to find and return the query
results. For more information about indexes, see the :doc:`complete
documentation of indexes in MongoDB</core/indexes>`.

.. example:: An application queries the ``inventory`` collection on the
   ``type`` field. The value of the ``type`` field is user-driven.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var typeValue = <someUserInput>;
      db.inventory.find( { type: typeValue } );

   To improve the performance of this query, add an ascending, or a
   descending, index to the ``inventory`` collection on the ``type``
   field. [#ensureIndexOrder]_ In the :program:`mongo` shell, you can
   create indexes using the :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()`
   method:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.inventory.ensureIndex( { type: 1 } )

   This index can prevent the above query on ``type`` from scanning the
   whole collection to return the results.

To analyze the performance of the query with an index, see
:doc:`/tutorial/analyze-query-plan`.

In addition to optimizing read operations, indexes can support sort
operations and allow for a more efficient storage utilization. See
:method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()` and
:doc:`/administration/indexes` for more information about index
creation.

.. [#ensureIndexOrder]
   For single-field indexes, the selection between ascending and
   descending order is immaterial. For compound indexes, the selection
   is important. See :ref:`indexing order
   <index-ascending-and-descending>` for more details.

.. _read-operations-query-selectivity:

Query Selectivity
-----------------

Some query operations are not selective. These operations cannot use
indexes effectively or cannot use indexes at all.

The inequality operators :operator:`$nin` and :operator:`$ne` are not
very selective, as they often match a large portion of the index. As a
result, in most cases, a :operator:`$nin` or :operator:`$ne` query with
an index may perform no better than a :operator:`$nin` or
:operator:`$ne` query that must scan all documents in a collection.

Queries that specify regular expressions, with inline JavaScript
regular expressions or :operator:`$regex` operator expressions, cannot
use an index with one exception. Queries that specify regular
expression *with anchors* at the beginning of a string *can* use an
index.

.. _read-operations-covered-query:

Covering a Query
----------------

An index :ref:`covers <indexes-covered-queries>` a query, a *covered
query*, when:

- all the fields in the :ref:`query <read-operations-query-document>`
  are part of that index, **and**

- all the fields returned in the documents that match the query are in
  the same index.

For these queries, MongoDB does not need to inspect documents outside
of the index. This is often more efficient than inspecting entire
documents.

.. example::

   Given a collection ``inventory`` with the following index on the
   ``type`` and ``item`` fields:

   .. code-block:: sh

      { type: 1, item: 1 }

   This index will cover the following query on the ``type`` and ``item``
   fields, which returns only the ``item`` field:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.inventory.find( { type: "food", item:/^c/ },
                         { item: 1, _id: 0 } )

   However, the index will **not** cover the following query, which
   returns the ``item`` field **and** the ``_id`` field:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.inventory.find( { type: "food", item:/^c/ },
                         { item: 1 } )

See :ref:`indexes-covered-queries` for more information on the
behavior and use of covered queries.
