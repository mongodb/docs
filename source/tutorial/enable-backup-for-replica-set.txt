=================================
Activate Backup for a Replica Set
=================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can start, restart, stop, and terminate backups for replica
sets. As appropriate, you also can specify which instance to use for
the initial sync, exclude namespaces, and change the
snapshot schedule and retention.

.. note::

   The replica set must be MongoDB version 2.2.0 or later.

Considerations
--------------

.. include:: /includes/considerations-backup-daemon-enable.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

Before enabling backup, ensure that the following is true for all replica
sets that you back up:

- MMS Monitoring is actively collecting data.

- There is an active :term:`primary`.

- If you explicitly select a sync target, ensure that the sync target is
  accessible on the network and keeping up with replication.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/backup-activate-replica-set.rst

Your Backup Agent will start polling the specified instance for this replica
set.

See :ref:`faq-backup` for more details about backup configuration,
namespaces, and snapshots.
