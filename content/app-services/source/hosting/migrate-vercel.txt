   Always refer to the official documentation of both MongoDB Atlas and Vercel
   for the most up-to-date and accurate information. Specific steps may vary
   depending on the details of your project and the technologies used.

Vercel is well-suited for hosting and web site or application, including static
sites, single-page applications (SPAs), dynamic server-rendered applications,
and more. It is compatible with your App Services application.

Migrating a web application from MongoDB Atlas hosting to Vercel involves a few
key steps. Below is a general guide to help you through the process.

Before You Begin
----------------

- As a precaution, ensure that you have a backup of your application and data
  before making any significant changes.
- Create a Vercel account. To learn how to create deployments on Vercel, visit
  the `official Vercel docs <https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview>`__. We
  will be showing you how to deploy using Git and the Vercel CLI below.
- If your application isn't already in a version control system, consider
  setting it up. Vercel seamlessly integrates with popular version control
  platforms.

Deploy with Git
---------------

Vercel documentation: `Deploy with Git <https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection>`__

#. Push your code to your git repository (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
#. Import your project into Vercel.
#. Optionally configure your project before it's deployed.
#. Select the Deploy button to initiative a deployment.
#. Your application is deployed! (e.g. create-react-template.vercel.app)

Deploy with the Vercel CLI
--------------------------

Vercel documentation: `Deploy from CLI <https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploying-from-cli>`__

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Install Vercel CLI

      Install the Vercel CLI on your local machine. This allows you to deploy
      and manage your projects using the command line.

      .. code-block:: shell
         :copyable: true
      
         npm i -g vercel

      Vercel documentation: https://vercel.com/docs/cli#installing-vercel-cli

   .. step:: Login to Vercel

      Log in to your Vercel account using the CLI

      .. code-block:: shell
         :copyable: true
      
         vercel login

   .. step:: Deploy to Vercel

      Deploy your application to Vercel using the following command:

      .. code-block:: shell
         :copyable: true
      
         vercel deploy

      Follow the prompts to complete the deployment process.

   .. step:: Update DNS records (optional)

      If your domain is currently pointed to MongoDB Atlas and you want to use
      the same domain with Vercel, update your DNS records to point to the
      Vercel domain.
    
   .. step:: Shut Down Atlas App Services Hosting

      Once you have verified that your application deploys successfully to
      Vercel, delete your hosted files from your Atlas App Services app.
      As a reminder, hosting domains on Atlas App Services will no longer run
      starting on September 30, 2025.

When you create a deployment, Vercel automatically adds a new and unique
generated URL. You can visit this URL to preview your changes in a live
environment.

After deploying, your new site will automatically be assigned a .vercel.app
suffixed domain. You can then add a Custom Domain of your choice, either from a
third-party or purchased through Vercel.

Deployment Protection on Vercel
-------------------------------

Vercel documentation: `Deployment Protection <https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection>`__

- `Password Protection <https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection>`__:
  Restricts access to your deployments to only users with the correct password.
  Password Protection is available on the Enterprise plan, or as a paid add-on
  for Pro plans
- `Trusted IPs <https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection>`__:
