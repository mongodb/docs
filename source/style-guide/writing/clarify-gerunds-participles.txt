Clarify Gerunds and Participles
===============================

Participles are verbs that end in *-ed* or *-ing* and act as modifiers.
Gerunds are verbs that end in *-ing* and act as nouns. Both types of
words are useful and acceptable, but they can cause confusion if they
are misplaced in a sentence. For example, the word *meeting* can be a
gerund or a participle (or even a noun) depending on its placement in a
sentence. When you use gerunds and participles, ensure that the meaning
is clear.

   * - When **you use** a load balancer with a public-facing IP
       address, this address becomes the IP address of your website.
     - When **using** a load balancer with a public-facing IP address,
       this address becomes the IP address of your website.

The last example illustrates a :ref:`dangling modifier
<dangling-modifiers>`. In the "Avoid" example, *using* doesn't have a
subject, so the implied subject is *address*, which is incorrect. If
the implied subject isn't correct, you must revise the sentence to
provide a subject for the modifying phrase.

The titles of tutorial or high-level process articles or topics usually
start with a gerund. Titles have less context than sentences, so you
have to be especially careful to ensure that the meaning is clear.
