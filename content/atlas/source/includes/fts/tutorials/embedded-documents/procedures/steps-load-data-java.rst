Create a Sample Collection and Load the Data 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must begin by creating a collection named ``schools`` in an 
existing or new database on your cluster. After creating the 
collection, you must upload the sample data into your collection. To
learn more about the documents in the sample collection, see
:ref:`embedded-documents-tutorial-sample-collection`. 

The steps in this section walk you through creating a new database 
and collection, and loading the sample data into your collection.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Set up your Java project with the MongoDB Java driver.

      .. include:: /includes/fts/field-types/add-java-dependency.rst

      For more detailed installation instructions and version compatibility, see
      the :driver:`MongoDB Java Driver documentation </java/sync/current/get-started/>`.

   .. step:: Create and populate the collections.

      Create and populate the ``schools`` collection:
    
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fts/tutorials/embedded-documents/sample-data.java
         :language: java
         :copyable:
         :linenos:

      .. include:: /includes/search-shared/find-connection-string.rst

   .. step:: Compile and run the file to create the index.

      Compile and run your application in your IDE or your shell. 

      .. io-code-block::
         :copyable: true

         .. input::
            :language: shell

            javac FileName.java
            java FileName

         .. output::
            :visible: false
