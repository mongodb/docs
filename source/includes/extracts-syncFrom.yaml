   Sync Logic
   ~~~~~~~~~~

   .. versionchanged:: 3.4

   If an initial sync operation is in progress when you run
   {{syncfrom}}, {{syncfrom}} stops the in-progress initial sync and
   restarts the sync process with the new target. In previous versions,
   if you run {{syncfrom}} during initial sync, MongoDB produces no
   error messages, but the sync target will not change until after the
   initial sync operation.

   Only modify the default sync logic as needed, and always exercise
   caution. 

   Target
   ~~~~~~

   The member to sync from must be a valid source for data in the set.
   To sync from a member, the member must:

   - Have data. It cannot be an arbiter, in startup or recovering mode, and
     must be able to answer data queries.

   - Be accessible.

   - Be a member of the same set in the replica set configuration.

   - Build indexes with the
     :rsconf:`members[n].buildIndexes` setting.

   - A different member of the set, to prevent syncing from itself.

   If you attempt to replicate from a member that is more than 10 seconds
   behind the current member, :binary:`~bin.mongod` will log a warning but will
   still replicate from the lagging member.

   Persistence
   ~~~~~~~~~~~

   {{syncfrom}} provide a temporary override of default behavior.
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` will revert to the default sync behavior in the
   following situations:

   - The :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance restarts.

   - The connection between the :binary:`~bin.mongod` and the sync target
     closes.

   - If the sync target falls more than 30 seconds behind another
     member of the replica set.
