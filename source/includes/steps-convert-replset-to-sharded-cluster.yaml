     After you convert a replica set to a sharded cluster, you can't 
     convert it again to a replica set.

title: "Select the number of shards from the dropdown."
content: |
  Sharding supports high throughput and large datasets, and you can  
  increase the number of shards as data requirements grow. By default,
  |service| creates two shards.

  It may take some time for |service| to deploy the changes. Please

  the next step.

  If you don't restart the application clients, your data might be 
  inconsistent after |service| begins distributing data across shards. 

  - If you are using a :manual:`DNS Seed List 
    </reference/connection-string/#dns-seed-list-connection-format>`
    connection string, your application automatically connects to the
    :binary:`mongos` for your sharded cluster.
  
  - If you are using a :manual:`standard connection string
    </reference/connection-string/#standard-connection-string-format>`,
    you must update your connection string to reflect your new cluster
    topology.

  - If you are using :doc:`private endpoints 
    </security-private-endpoint>` to connect to your |service| cluster, 
    perform a rolling restart of your applications to connect to the 
    :binary:`mongos` for your sharded cluster without any downtime.
