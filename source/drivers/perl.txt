.. default-domain:: mongodb

Installing
----------

Start a MongoDB server instance (:program:`mongod`) before installing so
that the tests will pass. The :program:`mongod` must be running as a primary
for the tests to pass.


Some tests may be skipped, depending on the version of the database you
are running.

CPAN
~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo cpan MongoDB

The Perl driver is available through CPAN as the package
`MongoDB <https://metacpan.org/module/MongoDB>`_.
It should build cleanly on \*NIX and Windows (via
`Strawberry Perl <http://strawberryperl.com/>`_).
It is also available as an ActivePerl module.

Manual (Non-CPAN) Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to try the latest code or are contributing to the Perl
driver, it is available at `GitHub <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-perl-driver>`_.

The Perl driver requires some libraries available in CPAN. As of September,
2013, these are: 

.. code-block:: sh

   Data::Types
   DateTime
   DateTime::Tiny
   ExtUtils::MakeMaker
   File::Slurp
   File::Temp
   FileHandle
   JSON
   Test::Exception
   Test::Warn
   Tie::IxHash
   Try::Tiny
   boolean
   ExtUtils::MakeMaker
   Class::Method::Modifiers
   DateTime
   Digest::MD5
   Moose
   Tie::IxHash
   XSLoader

In order to install the dependencies, first copy the names of the
packages into a text file, packages.txt. Then run the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo cpan App::cpanminus
   cat packages.txt | sudo cpanm

Before you are able to build the MongoDB module, you'll also need
Dist::Zilla. Get Dist::Zilla and its dependencies with the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo cpan Dist::Zilla
   dzil authordeps | sudo cpanm

Next, use Dist::Zilla to create a copy of the driver module with the
correct version information:

.. code-block:: sh

   dzil build

This will create a new directory named something like MongoDB-0.702.1.
To build and install the driver, change to this directory and run:

.. code-block:: sh

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test # make sure mongod is running, first
   sudo make install

The tests will not pass without a :program:`mongod` process running.

Big-Endian Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver will work on big-endian machines, but the database will not.
The tests assume that :program:`mongod` will be running on localhost
unless ``%ENV{MONGOD}`` is set. So, to run the tests, start the database
on a little-endian machine (at, say, "example.com") and then run the
tests with:

.. code-block:: sh

   MONGOD=example.com make test

A few tests that require a database server on ``localhost`` will be
skipped.

Next Steps
----------

There is a tutorial and API documentation on `CPAN <http://metacpan.org/module/MongoDB/>`_.

MongoDB Perl Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BSON
----

`BSON <https://metacpan.org/module/BSON>`_ is a pure-Perl BSON
implementation. Created by Stefan G.

Entities::Backend::MongoDB
--------------------------

`Entities::Backend::MongoDB <https://metacpan.org/module/Entities::Backend::MongoDB>`_
is a backend for the Entities user management and authorization system. It
stores all entities and relations between them in a MongoDB database. Created by 
Ido Perlmuter.

Mango
-----
`Mango <https://metacpan.org/module/Mango>`_ is a pure-Perl, non-blocking, 
asynchronous driver for MongoDB, designed to work with the Mojolicious web framework. 
Created by Sebastian Riedel.

Meerkat
-------
`Meerkat <https://metacpan.org/module/Meerkat>`_ lets you manage MongoDB documents 
as Moose objects. Your objects represent projections of the document state maintained in the database.
Meerkat is designed for atomic operations that keep client-side objects in sync with 
the database. Created by David Golden.

MojoX::Session::Store::MongoDB
------------------------------
`MojoX::Session::Store::MongoDB <https://metacpan.org/module/MojoX::Session::Store::MongoDB>`_
is a store for `MojoX::Session <https://metacpan.org/module/MojoX::Session>`_
that stores a session in a MongoDB database. Created by Ask Bjørn Hansen.

MongoDB::Admin
--------------

`MongoDB::Admin <https://metacpan.org/module/MongoDB::Admin>`_ is a
collection of MongoDB administrative functions. Created by David Burley.

MongoDB::Simple
---------------
`MongoDB::Simple` <https://metacpan.org/module/MongoDB::Simple>`_ is
a basic object-to-document mapping system with few dependencies. Created
by Ian Kent.

Mongoose
--------
`Mongoose <https://metacpan.org/module/Mongoose>`_ is an attempt to
bring together the full power of Moose with MongoDB. It provides a full suite
of object-to-document mapping facilities. Created by Rodrigo
de Oliveira Gonzalez.

MongoDBI
--------
`MongoDBI <https://metacpan.org/module/MongoDBI>`_ is an
Object-Document-Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB. It allows you to create
Moose-based classes to interact with MongoDB databases.

MongoDBI allows you to easily model classes while leveraging 
the power of MongoDB's schema-less and expeditious document-based design, 
dynamic queries, and atomic modifier operations. Created by Al Newkirk.

MongoDBx::Class
---------------
`MongoDBx::Class <https://metacpan.org/module/MongoDBx::Class>`_ is an
ORM for MongoDB databases. MongoDBx::Class takes advantage of the fact
that Perl's MongoDB driver is Moose-based to extend and tweak the
driver's behavior, instead of wrapping it. This means MongoDBx::Class
does not define its own syntax, so you simply use it exactly as you
would the MongoDB driver directly. Created by Ido Perlmuter. 

MongoDBx::Queue
---------------
`MongoDBx::Queue <https://metacpan.org/module/MongoDBx::Queue>`_ is
a basic message queue system backed by MongoDB. Created by David Golden.

MongoX
------
`MongoX <https://metacpan.org/module/MongoX>`_ is light wrapper for 
MongoDB, providing some nice DSL sugar. Created by Pan Fan.

MooseX::Role::MongoDB
---------------------
`MooseX::Role::MongoDB <https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::Role::MongoDB>`_
is a Moose role which provides connection management and automatic 
fork handling for the MongoDB driver. Created by David Golden.

OOP Perl CMS
------------

`OOP Perl CMS <http://www.waitman.net/mod_perl-mongodb-CMS.html>`_ is
based on Khurt Williams' Object Oriented Perl methodology and can be
used as a basic CMS framework or as a basis for your own CMS system. It
uses Apache & mod_perl with MongoDB backend. Created by Waitman Gobble.
