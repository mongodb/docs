Definition
----------

.. method:: cursor.forEach(function)

   .. include:: /includes/fact-mongosh-shell-method.rst

   Iterates the cursor to apply a JavaScript ``function`` to each
   document from the cursor.

Compatibility
-------------

This method is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The method has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   db.collection.find().forEach( <function> )

Method Fields
-------------

The method accepts the following field:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``function``
     - JavaScript code
     - Function to apply to each document returned from the cursor. The
       function signature includes one field that stores the current
       document that is read from the cursor.

Examples
--------

Create the ``users`` collection:

.. code-block:: none

   db.users.insertMany( [
      { name: "John" },
      { name: "Jane" }
   ] )

The following example uses ``forEach()`` with the
:method:`~db.collection.find()` method to print the user names that are
read from the ``users`` collection. ``myDoc`` stores the current
document.

.. code-block:: none

   db.users.find().forEach( function( myDoc ) {
      print( "User name: " + myDoc.name )
   } )

Example output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   User name: John
   User name: Jane

Starting in :binary:`~bin.mongosh` 2.1.0, you can also use ``for-of``
loops. The following example returns the same results as the previous
example:

.. code-block:: none

   for ( const myDoc of db.users.find() ) {
      print( "User name: " + myDoc.name )
   }
