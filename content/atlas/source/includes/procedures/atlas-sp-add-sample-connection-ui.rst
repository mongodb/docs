   .. step:: Go to the :guilabel:`Connection Registry`.

      a. Locate the overview panel of the {+spw+} you want to 
         modify and click :guilabel:`Configure`. 

      #. Select the :guilabel:`Connection Registry` tab.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`+ Add connection`.

   .. step:: Add a new connection.

      You can use a sample connection built into {+atlas-sp+} to
      develop and test new stream processors. The sample connection
      acts as a source of streaming data, but cannot be used as a 
      sink.

      To create a new connection to the sample stream:

      a. Select a :guilabel:`Sample Stream` connection.

      #. From the dropdown menu, select ``sample_stream_solar``.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Add connection`.
