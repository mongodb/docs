Depending on whether you use a {+shared-cluster+} or a {+dedicated-cluster+}, 
your bill may include different line items and information for you to consider. 

Understanding Shared vs. {+Dedicated-Clusters+}
------------------------------------------------

{+Shared-Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+Shared-clusters+} are ideal for learning and exploring MongoDB in a sandbox 
environment. {+Shared-cluster+} considerations include:

- Multiple {+clusters+} share hardware. The underlying 
  compute is on a large machine that hosts many {+shared-clusters+}, which impacts 
  maximum performance and storage capacity.

- Despite the shared hardware, all data is secure and accessible 
  only by you.

- {+Shared-clusters+} do not have access to advanced features 
  such as query diagnosis tools and horizontal scaling, which makes them a good fit 
  for non-production use cases.

{+Dedicated-Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+Dedicated-clusters+} are designed for more robust workloads, offering greater 
control and guaranteed resources:

- Your {+cluster+}'s hardware is dedicated to your workload. 
  Dedicated hardware provides granularity in the control of hardware specifications 
  like RAM, vCPU, and storage.

- We guarantee the availability of the specified resources, 
  which ensures consistent performance.

- Backup settings are more robust in {+dedicated-clusters+}. 
  You can configure backup settings for {+dedicated-clusters+} with granularity 
  as low as one-second intervals.

- You have access to our premium diagnostic tools such as 
  :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` and `Query Insights <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cloud-manager/query-insights/>`__.

Billing Breakdown for Each Tier
-------------------------------

{+Shared-Cluster+} Billing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Billing for {+shared-clusters+} is straightforward and designed to keep costs low 
and predictable.

{+Shared-clusters+} feature:

- Typically ranges from $0 to $25 per month, depending on 
  the specific tier.

- There are no additional charges for features that are unavailable in this tier, 
  including :ref:`backups <restore-archive-snapshots>`, :ref:`vertical cluster scaling <sizing>`, 
  :manual:`query diagnostics </tutorial/evaluate-operation-performance>`, and 
  :manual:`horizontal scaling (sharding) </sharding>`. Exclusion of these features 
  makes {+shared-clusters+} a good option for experimenting and exploring |service| 
  without worrying about unexpected costs.

{+Dedicated-Cluster+} Billing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Billing for {+dedicated-clusters+} is more complex, which reflects the enhanced 
capabilities and resources:

- Starts at $60 per month, which typically includes compute 
  and included storage costs.

- There may be usage fees for services such as backups 
  (depending on frequency and configuration), storage beyond the default :ref:`cluster 
  tier <create-cluster-instance>` threshold, and data transfers.

- The selected tier impacts the structure of your invoice, 
  with various line items reflecting different aspects of your {+cluster+}'s usage.
