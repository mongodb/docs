The aggregation pipeline is a framework for data aggregation,
modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines.

To learn more about aggregation, see :manual:`Aggregation Pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline/>` in the Server manual.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must set up the following components to run the code examples in
this guide:

- A ``test.restaurants`` collection populated with documents from the
  ``restaurants.json`` file in the `documentation assets GitHub
  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/drivers/restaurants.json>`__.

- The following import statements:

.. code-block:: java

   import com.mongodb.reactivestreams.client.MongoClients;
   import com.mongodb.reactivestreams.client.MongoClient;
   import com.mongodb.reactivestreams.client.MongoCollection;
   import com.mongodb.reactivestreams.client.MongoDatabase;
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Aggregates;
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Accumulators;
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Projections;
   import com.mongodb.client.model.Filters;
         
   import org.bson.Document;

.. important::

   This guide uses the ``Subscriber`` implementations, which are
   described in the :ref:`Quick Start Primer <javars-primer>`.

Connect to a MongoDB Deployment
-------------------------------

First, connect to a MongoDB deployment and declare and define
``MongoDatabase`` and ``MongoCollection`` instances.

The following code connects to a standalone
MongoDB deployment running on ``localhost`` on port ``27017``. Then, it
defines the ``database`` variable to refer to the ``test`` database and
the ``collection`` variable to refer to the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoClient mongoClient = MongoClients.create();
   MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("test");
   MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("restaurants");

To learn more about connecting to MongoDB deployments,
see the :ref:`javars-connect` tutorial.

Perform Aggregation
-------------------

To perform aggregation, pass a list of aggregation stages to the
``MongoCollection.aggregate()`` method. The driver provides the
``Aggregates`` helper class that contains builders for aggregation
stages.

In this example, the aggregation pipeline performs the
following tasks:

- Uses a ``$match`` stage to filter for documents in which the
  ``categories`` array field contains the element ``"Bakery"``. The example
  uses ``Aggregates.match()`` to build the ``$match`` stage.

+ Uses a ``$group`` stage to group the matching documents by
  the ``stars`` field, accumulating a count of documents for each distinct
  value of ``stars``. The example uses ``Aggregates.group()`` to build the
  ``$group`` stage and ``Accumulators.sum()`` to build the accumulator
  expression. For the accumulator expressions for use within the
  ``$group`` stage, the driver provides ``Accumulators`` helper
  class.

.. code-block:: java

   collection.aggregate(
       Arrays.asList(
           Aggregates.match(Filters.eq("categories", "Bakery")),
           Aggregates.group("$stars", Accumulators.sum("count", 1))
       )
   ).subscribe(new PrintDocumentSubscriber());

Use Aggregation Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For ``$group`` accumulator expressions, the driver provides the
``Accumulators`` helper class. For other aggregation expressions,
manually build the expression by using the ``Document`` class.

In the following example, the aggregation pipeline uses a
``$project`` stage to return only the ``name`` field and the calculated
field ``firstCategory`` whose value is the first element in the
``categories`` array. The example uses ``Aggregates.project()`` and
various ``Projections`` class methods to build the ``$project`` stage:

.. code-block:: java

   collection.aggregate(
       Arrays.asList(
           Aggregates.project(
               Projections.fields(
                   Projections.excludeId(),
                   Projections.include("name"),
                   Projections.computed(
                       "firstCategory",
                           new Document("$arrayElemAt", Arrays.asList("$categories", 0))
                   )
               )
           )
       )
   ).subscribe(new PrintDocumentSubscriber());

Explain an Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ``$explain`` an aggregation pipeline, call the
``AggregatePublisher.explain()`` method:

.. code-block:: java

   collection.aggregate(
       Arrays.asList(
           Aggregates.match(Filters.eq("categories", "Bakery")),
           Aggregates.group("$stars", Accumulators.sum("count", 1))))
       .explain()
       .subscribe(new PrintDocumentSubscriber());
