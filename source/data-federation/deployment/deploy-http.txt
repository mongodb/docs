This page describes how to deploy a {+fdi+} for 
accessing data in an |http| data store.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-http-beta-message.rst

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, you will need to:

- Create a `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_atlas>`__ 
  account, if you do not have one already.

- Format your data store using one of the :ref:`supported data formats
  <adf-data-formats>`.

  .. note::
   
     If your file format is ``CSV`` or ``TSV``, you must include a header 
     row in your data. See :ref:`adf-csv-tsv-data` for more 
     information.

- Make your data store accessible over the public internet.

.. important::

    - If your |http| data store is not accessible over |https|, you must
      use the :guilabel:`JSON Editor` to configure your data store.
      In your |json| configuration, you must set the
      :datalakeconf-http:`stores.[n].allowInsecure` setting to ``true``.

    - {+adf+} does not support |http| data store |url|\s that require
      authentication.
