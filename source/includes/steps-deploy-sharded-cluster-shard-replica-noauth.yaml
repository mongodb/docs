  file: steps-deploy-replica-set-with-auth.yaml
  ref: deploy-repset-start-members
pre: |
  Start *each* :program:`mongod` in the replica set using either 
  a configuration file or the command line.
action:
  - pre: |
      **Configuration File**
      
      If using a configuration file, set the :setting:`replication.replSetName`
      to the desired name of the replica set, and the 
      :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` option to ``shardsvr``.
    language: yaml
    code: |
      sharding:
        clusterRole: shardsvr
      replication:
        replSetName: <replSetName>
    post: |
      Include any other options as appropriate for your deployment. See
      :doc:`/reference/configuration-options` for settings available.
  - pre: |
       Start the :program:`mongod` specifying the ``--config`` option
       and the path to the configuration file.
    language: sh
    code: |
       mongod --config <path-to-config-file>
  - pre: |
      **Command Line**
      
      If using the command line option, when starting the component, specify 
      the ``replSet``, and ``--shardsvr`` parameters, as in the
      following example:
    language: sh
    code: |
       mongod --shardsvr --replSet <replSetname>

       Include any other options as appropriate for your deployment.

      The following example initates a three member replica set.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      rs.initiate(
        {
          _id : <replicaSetName>,
          members: [
            { _id : 0, host : "s1-mongo1.example.net:27017" },
            { _id : 1, host : "s1-mongo2.example.net:27017" },
            { _id : 2, host : "s1-mongo3.example.net:27017" }
