.. query:: $geoIntersects

   Selects documents whose geospatial data intersects with a specified
   :ref:`GeoJSON <geospatial-indexes-store-geojson>` object; i.e. where
   the intersection of the data and the specified object is non-empty.

   The :query:`$geoIntersects` operator uses the :query:`$geometry`
   operator to specify the :ref:`GeoJSON
   <geospatial-indexes-store-geojson>` object. To specify a GeoJSON
   polygons or multipolygons using the default coordinate reference
   system (CRS), use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        <location field>: {
           $geoIntersects: {
              $geometry: {
                 type: "<GeoJSON object type>" ,
                 coordinates: [ <coordinates> ]
              }
           }
        }
      }

   For :query:`$geoIntersects` queries that specify GeoJSON geometries
   with areas greater than a single hemisphere, the use of the default
   CRS results in queries for the complementary geometries.

   A complementary geometry is the smaller of two geometries. If a
   specified geometry covers more than a hemisphere, the default CRS
   query returns documents for the complementary geometry.

   For example, if you define a geometry to be an area covering 75% of
   Earth's surface, CRS uses the remaining 25% as the complementary
   area. The query returns results from that smaller complementary 25%
   area instead of the larger 75%.

   The :ref:`geointersects-examples` section on this page shows how to
   specify smaller and larger areas.

   To specify a single-ringed GeoJSON :ref:`polygon
   <geojson-polygon>` with a custom MongoDB CRS, use the following
   prototype that specifies the custom MongoDB CRS in the
   :query:`$geometry` expression:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        <location field>: {
           $geoIntersects: {
              $geometry: {
                 type: "Polygon" ,
                 coordinates: [ <coordinates> ],
                 crs: {
                    type: "name",
                    properties: { name: "urn:x-mongodb:crs:strictwinding:EPSG:4326" }
                 }
              }
           }
        }
      }

   The custom MongoDB CRS uses a counter-clockwise winding order and
   allows :query:`$geoIntersects` to support queries with a
   single-ringed GeoJSON :ref:`polygon <geojson-polygon>` whose area is
   greater than or equal to a single hemisphere. If the specified
   polygon is smaller than a single hemisphere, the behavior of
   :query:`$geoIntersects` with the MongoDB CRS is the same as with the
   default CRS. See also :ref:`geointersects-big-poly`.

Behavior
--------

Geospatial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:query:`$geoIntersects` uses spherical geometry.
:query:`$geoIntersects` does not require a geospatial index. However, a
geospatial index will improve query performance. Only the
:ref:`2dsphere <2dsphere-index>` geospatial index supports
:query:`$geoIntersects`.

Degenerate Geometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:query:`$geoIntersects` does not guarantee that it will consider a
polygon to intersect with its own edges; its own vertices; or another
polygon sharing vertices or edges but no interior space.

"Big" Polygons

Examples
--------

Intersects a Polygon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses :query:`$geoIntersects` to select all
``loc`` data that intersect with the :ref:`geojson-polygon` defined by
the ``coordinates`` array. The area of the polygon is less than the
area of a single hemisphere:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find(
      {
        loc: {
          $geoIntersects: {
             $geometry: {
                type: "Polygon" ,
                coordinates: [
                  [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 3, 6 ], [ 6, 1 ], [ 0, 0 ] ]
                ]
             }
          }
        }
      }
   )

For single-ringed polygons with areas greater than a single hemisphere,
see :ref:`geointersects-big-polygon`.

.. _geointersects-big-polygon:

Intersects a "Big" Polygon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query with a single-ringed GeoJSON polygon whose area is greater
than a single hemisphere, the :query:`$geometry` expression must
specify the custom MongoDB coordinate reference system. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find(
      {
        loc: {
          $geoIntersects: {
             $geometry: {
                type : "Polygon",
                coordinates: [
                  [
                    [ -100, 60 ], [ -100, 0 ], [ -100, -60 ], [ 100, -60 ], [ 100, 60 ], [ -100, 60 ]
                  ]
                ],
                crs: {
                   type: "name",
                   properties: { name: "urn:x-mongodb:crs:strictwinding:EPSG:4326" }
                }
             }
          }
        }
      }
   )
