  Skip this step if you already have an |service| cluster as the destination
  of the live migration process.
  
  Create a new |service| cluster, configuring it as needed. For complete
  documentation on creating an |service| cluster, see 
  :doc:`/create-new-cluster`.
  
  Once |service| has deployed your new cluster, proceed to the next step.

  #. Click the ellipses :guilabel:`...` icon for the destination 
     |service| cluster.
     
  #. Click :guilabel:`Migrate Data to this Cluster`. 
  
  #. |service| displays a walk-through walk-through screen with instructions on
     how to proceed with the live migration. Prepare the information as stated 
     in the walk-through screen, then click :guilabel:`I'm Ready To Migrate`.
  
  #. |service| displays a walk-through screen that collects information 
     required to connect to the source cluster. 
  
     - Enter the hostname and port of the primary member of the source cluster
       into the provided text box. For example,
       ``mongoPrimary.example.net:27017``.
     
     - If the source cluster enforces authentication, enter a username and
       password into the provided text boxes. The username must
       correspond to a MongoDB user on the ``admin`` database with the
       :authrole:`readAnyDatabase` role.
     
     - If the source cluster uses ``TLS/SSL``, toggle the ``SSL`` button.
     
     - If the source replica set uses ``TLS/SSL`` *and* is not using a public
       Certificate Authority (CA), copy the contents of the source cluster's
       :abbr:`CA (Certificate Authority)` file into the provided text box.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Validate` to confirm that |service| can connect to the
     source replica set.
     
     If validation fails, check that:
       
     - You have :ref:`whitelisted <live-import-ip-whitelist>` |service|
       on your source cluster.
       
     - The provided user credentials, if any, exist on the source cluster
       and have the required permissions.
       
     - The :guilabel:`SSL` toggle is enabled only if the source cluster
       requires it.
       
     - The CA file provided, if any, is valid and correct.
     
  #. Click :guilabel:`Start Migration` to start the migration process.
  
     Once the migration process begins, the |service| UI displays the
     :guilabel:`Migrating Data` walk-through screen for the destination
     |service| cluster. This walk-through screen updates as destination
     cluster proceeds through the migration process, as well as the time
     remaining for the destination cluster to sync with the source cluster.
  
  When the migration timer and the :guilabel:`Start Cut Over` button turn
  green, proceed to the next step.

  When |service| detects that the source and destination clusters are nearly
  in sync, it starts an extendable 72 hour timer to begin the cut over
  procedure. If the 72 hour period passes, |service| stops synchronizing with
  the source cluster. You can extend the time remaining by 24 hours by
  clicking the :guilabel:`Extend time` hyperlink below the :guilabel:`<time>
  left to cut over` timer.

  #. Once you are prepared to cut your applications over to the
     destination |service| cluster, click :guilabel:`Start Cut Over`.
     
  #. |service| displays a walk-through screen with instructions 
     on how to proceed with the cut over. 
     
     Perform the steps described in the walk-through screen to cut over your
     applications to the |service| cluster. The walk-through screen provides
     the cluster connection string your applications use for connectivity.
     
  #. Once you have completed the cut over procedure and confirmed 
     your applications are working normally with the |service| cluster, click
     :guilabel:`I'm Done` to complete the migration procedure.
