Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the {+driver-long+}, the
official driver for asynchronous Java applications. Download
the driver by following the :ref:`javars-install` guide, then set up a
runnable project by following one of the tutorials.

- :ref:`javars-install`

- :ref:`javars-get-started`

- :ref:`javars-tutorials`

- :ref:`javars-reference`

- `Driver Source GitHub Repository <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver>`__

- `API Documentation <{+api+}/mongodb-driver-reactivestreams/>`__

If you need to make synchronous calls between your application and MongoDB, use
the :driver:`MongoDB Java Driver </java/sync/current/>` instead of the
{+driver-short+}.
