|service-fullname| provides an easy way to host and manage your data in
the cloud. It includes tools that automate the deployment, scaling, and
maintenance of your {+service+} {+clusters+} to streamline operations,
reduce manual interventions, and ensure consistent, policy-compliant
deployments. These tools offer you the flexibility to work with
|service| through direct scripting (such as scripts that call the
{+atlas-admin-api+}), a Kubernetes-native workflow, or
using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform.    

{+service+} Features and Recommendations for Automation
-------------------------------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

You can automate the management, provisioning, and configuration of
|service| building blocks like database users and roles, |service|
{+clusters+}, projects and organizations. Additionally, you can automate
temporary access list entries that expire after a user-defined period, and
setting up and managing of additional {+clusters+} resources, including
enabling auto-scaling compute and storage, creating and updating
multi-cloud {+clusters+}, monitoring {+cluster+} performance and health,
automating backups and restores, defining backup policies, and many more.

You can align your choice of tools with your preferred workflow to
ensure seamless integration of |service-fullname| into your existing
processes. The following |service-fullname| tools allow you to easily
deploy and manage |service| at scale with repeatable, accurate, and
scalable processes. 

{+atlas-admin-api+} 
`````````````````````````````

The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides a |rest|\ful interface that allows you
to leverage your preferred client such as cURL or Postman to
directly interact with |api| endpoints that correspond to |service|
resources. They can also be directly called in your favorite
programming language or bash script.

To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-admin-api-access`.

GoSDK Client 
````````````

The {+service+} Go SDK client simplifies interaction with the
{+atlas-admin-api+} by providing pre-built functions and full |api|
endpoint coverage. The SDK provides platform-specific and GoLang
language-specific tools, libraries, and documentation to help build
applications quickly and easily.  

To learn more, see :ref:`Atlas Go SDK <atlas-admin-sdk>`.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Integrations 
`````````````````````````````````````````

The integrations with the following :abbr:`IaC (Infrastructure as Code)`
tools automate the deployment of |service| resources.

HashiCorp Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider
##########################################

Provisions |service| resources across cloud providers (|aws|, |azure|,
|gcp|) in the workflow of your choice. It allows you to integrate
|service| into your continuous delivery workflows with the official
plugin.

Alternatively, you can use the :abbr:`CDKTF (Cloud Development Kit for
Terraform)` to deploy |service| in preferred languages such as
JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go. 

To learn more, see :ref:`getting-started-terraform` and the
`MongoDB Atlas Provider Terraform docs <https://registry.terraform.io/providers/mongodb/mongodbatlas/latest/docs>`__. You can also use the Terraform examples in the
{+atlas-arch-center+} such as the :ref:`Org, Project, and
Cluster<arch-center-hierarchy>` examples to get started. 

CloudFormation Resources
########################

Resources to manage |service| include:
      
- :github:`JSON and YAML templates
  <mongodb/mongodbatlas-cloudformation-resources/tree/master/examples>` allow you to leverage
  multiple different types of |service| resources in the |aws|
  CloudFormation Public Registry.   
- `AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) <https://constructs.dev/search?q=&keywords=MongoDB&offset=0&tags=mongodb-published>`__
  defines infrastructure using familiar programming languages such as
  JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go. 

To learn more, see `Deploy MongoDB Atlas with AWS CloudFormation <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/deploy-mongodb-atlas-aws-cloudformation/>`__.
   
{+atlas-cli+} 
`````````````

Enables you to create, manage, and automate tasks related to |service|
resources from a unified command line tool. 

To learn more, see the following resources:

- :ref:`Atlas CLI <atlascli>`
- :ref:`Quick Start <atlas-cli-quick-start>`
- :ref:`atlas-cli-ephemeral-cluster`

You can also use the {+atlas-cli+}
examples in the {+atlas-arch-center+} such as the :ref:`Org, Project,
and Cluster<arch-center-hierarchy>` examples to get started.

|ak8so| 
`````````````````````````

Allows you to deploy and manage |service| resources using you existing
Kubernetes tools. The Operator enables management of |service| through
custom resources applied into Kubernetes, which the Operator uses to
configure |service|.  

To learn more, see :ref:`ak8so-quick-start-ref`. 

Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have an existing tool integrated into your deployment
workflow that you use today, we recommend that you use that tool for
automation. For example, if your developers and operations team are
used to building custom resource definitions for Kubernetes for
deployment, use the |ak8so| and Kubernetes for automation in 
{+service+}.

If you don't already have an existing tool integrated into your development workflow, we recommend an :ref:`IaC tool <arch-center-iac>`
because they provide more robust options for infrastructure provisioning and state management.
If you instead call the {+atlas-admin-api+} directly or use the GoSDK, which wraps the {+atlas-admin-api+}, you might need to recreate your
infrastructure provisioning each time to match your needs across
environments.

You can also use a combination of multiple tools. For example, use IaC
tool for provisioning and state management, and leverage the {+atlas-admin-api+}, GoSDK, and {+atlas-cli+} for quick administrative
tasks that are ephemeral in nature. The {+atlas-cli+} is great for
local development as well as integration into a suite of tests as part
of your CI/CD pipeline for application development because it improves
response times and reduces costs.
