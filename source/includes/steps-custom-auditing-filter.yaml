  .. warning::

     Enabling :guilabel:`Audit authorization successes` can severely 
     impact cluster performance. Enable this option with caution.

  For audit filters specifying the 
  ``authCheck`` :manual:`action type 
  </reference/audit-message/#audit-event-actions-details-and-results>`, 
  by default the
  auditing system logs only authorization
  failures for any specified ``param.command``. Enabling
  :guilabel:`Audit authorization successes` directs the auditing
  system to also log authorization successes. For more information,
  see :manual:`auditAuthorizationSuccess 
  </reference/parameters/#param.auditAuthorizationSuccess>`
