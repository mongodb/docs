   .. important::

      In most cases, multi-document transaction incurs a greater
      performance cost over single document writes, and the
      availability of multi-document transactions should not be a
      replacement for effective schema design. For many scenarios, the
      :ref:`denormalized data model (embedded documents and arrays)
      <data-modeling-embedding>` will continue to be optimal for your
      data and use cases. That is, for many scenarios, modeling your data
      appropriately will minimize the need for multi-document
      transactions. 
      
      For additional transactions usage considerations
      (such as runtime limit and oplog size limit), see also

   For situations that require atomicity of reads and writes to multiple
   documents (in a single or multiple collections), MongoDB supports
   multi-document transactions:

   - **In version 4.0**, MongoDB supports multi-document transactions on
     replica sets.

   - **In version 4.2**, MongoDB introduces distributed transactions,
     which adds support for multi-document transactions on sharded
     clusters and incorporates the existing support for
     multi-document transactions on replica sets.

   For details regarding transactions in MongoDB, see the
   :doc:`/core/transactions` page.

---
ref: transactions-faq
content: |
   Because a single document can contain related data that would otherwise
   be modeled across separate parent-child tables in a relational schema,
   MongoDB's atomic single-document operations already provide transaction
   semantics that meet the data integrity needs of the majority of
   applications. One or more fields may be written in a single operation,
   including updates to multiple sub-documents and elements of an array.
   The guarantees provided by MongoDB ensure complete isolation as a
   document is updated; any errors cause the operation to roll back so
   that clients receive a consistent view of the document.

   However, for situations that require atomicity of reads and writes
   to multiple documents (in a single or multiple collections), MongoDB
   supports multi-document transactions:

   - **In version 4.0**, MongoDB supports multi-document transactions on
     replica sets.

   - **In version 4.2**, MongoDB introduces distributed transactions,
     which adds support for multi-document transactions on sharded
     clusters and incorporates the existing support for
     multi-document transactions on replica sets.

ref: transactions-operations-restrictions
content: |
 
   The following operations are not allowed in transactions:

   - Operations that affect the database catalog, such as creating or
     dropping a collection or an index. For example, a
     transaction cannot include an insert operation that would result
     in the creation of a new collection.

     The :dbcommand:`listCollections` and :dbcommand:`listIndexes`
     commands and their helper methods are also excluded.
 
   - Non-CRUD and non-informational operations, such as
     :dbcommand:`createUser`, :dbcommand:`getParameter`,
     :dbcommand:`count`, etc. and their helpers.

---
ref: transactions-operations-restrictions-info
content: |

   Informational commands, such as :dbcommand:`hello`,
   :dbcommand:`buildInfo`, :dbcommand:`connectionStatus` (and their
   helper methods) are allowed in transactions; however, they cannot be
   the first operation in the transaction.

   - You cannot write to :doc:`capped </core/capped-collections>`
     collections. (Starting in MongoDB 4.2)

   - You cannot read/write to collections in the ``config``, ``admin``,
     or ``local`` databases.

   - You cannot write to ``system.*`` collections.

   - You cannot return the supported operation's query plan (i.e. ``explain``).

     :dbcommand:`distinct` command as well as the aggregation pipeline
     with the :pipeline:`$group` stage.
  
   - For sharded collections, you cannot use the
     :method:`db.collection.distinct()` method or the
     :dbcommand:`distinct` command.
     
     To find the distinct values for a sharded collection, use the
     aggregation pipeline with the :pipeline:`$group` stage instead.
     See :ref:`transactions-operations-distinct` for details.

ref: transactions-operations-write-concern
content: |

   Do not explicitly set the write concern for the operation if run in
   a transaction. To use write concern with transactions, see
   :ref:`transactions-write-concern`.

---
ref: transactions-write-conflict
content: |

   If a transaction is in progress and a write
   outside the transaction modifies a document that an operation in the
   transaction later tries to modify, the transaction aborts because of
   a write conflict.

   If a transaction is in progress and has taken a lock
   to modify a document, when a write outside the transaction tries to
   modify the same document, the write waits until the transaction ends.

---
ref: transactions-stale-reads
content: |

   Read operations inside a transaction can return stale data. That is,
   read operations inside a transaction are not guaranteed to see
   writes performed by other committed transactions or
   non-transactional writes. For
   example, consider the following sequence: 1) a transaction is
   in-progress 2) a write outside the transaction deletes a document 3)
   a read operation inside the transaction is able to read the
   now-deleted document since the operation is using a snapshot from
   before the write.

   To avoid stale reads inside transactions for a single document, you
   can use the :method:`db.collection.findOneAndUpdate()` method. For
   example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      session.startTransaction( { readConcern: { level: "snapshot" }, writeConcern: { w: "majority" } } );

      employeesCollection = session.getDatabase("hr").employees;

      employeeDoc = employeesCollection.findOneAndUpdate( 
         { _id: 1, employee: 1, status: "Active" },
         { $set: { employee: 1 } },
         { returnNewDocument: true }
      );

   - If the employee document has changed outside the transaction, then
     the transaction aborts.

   - If the employee document has not changed, the transaction returns
     the document and locks the document.
---
ref: transactions-read-concern-majority
content: |
   Disabling :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern affects support for
   :doc:`transactions </core/transactions>` on sharded clusters. Specifically:

   - A transaction cannot use read concern :readconcern:`"snapshot"` if
     the transaction involves a shard that has :ref:`disabled read
     concern "majority" <disable-read-concern-majority>`.

   - A transaction that writes to multiple shards errors if any of the
     transaction's read or write operations involves a shard that has
     disabled read concern :readconcern:`"majority"`.

   However, it does not affect :doc:`transactions </core/transactions>`
   on replica sets. For transactions on replica sets, you can specify
   read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` (or :readconcern:`"snapshot"`
   or :readconcern:`"local"` ) for multi-document transactions even if
   read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` is disabled.
   
# This is included in pages talking more about disabling rc majority and its effects.

# Separate includes (see below) for transactions pages where the transactions leads as the subject
---
ref: transactions-read-concern-majority-sharded-clusters
content: |

   On sharded clusters, 
      - If a transaction involves a shard that has :ref:`disabled read
        concern "majority" <disable-read-concern-majority>`, you cannot
        use read concern :readconcern:`"snapshot"` for the transaction.
        You can only use read concern :readconcern:`"local"` or
        :readconcern:`"majority"` for the transaction. If you use read
        concern :readconcern:`"snapshot"`, the transaction errors and
        aborts.

        .. code-block:: none
           :copyable: false

           readConcern level 'snapshot' is not supported in sharded clusters when enableMajorityReadConcern=false.

      - Transactions whose write operations span multiple shards will
        error and abort if any of the transaction's read or write
        operations involves a shard that has disabled read concern
        ``"majority"``.

---
ref: transactions-read-concern-majority-replica-set
content: |  

   On replica set,
      You can specify read concern :readconcern:`"local"` or
      :readconcern:`"majority"` or :readconcern:`"snapshot"` even in
      the replica set has :ref:`disabled read concern "majority"
      <disable-read-concern-majority>`.
   
      However, if you are planning to transition to a sharded cluster with
      disabled read concern majority shards, you may wish to avoid using
      read concern ``"snapshot"``.

---
ref: transactions-chunk-migration
content: |
   :ref:`Chunk migration <chunk-migration-procedure>` acquires
   exclusive collection locks during certain stages.

   If an ongoing transaction has a lock on a collection and a chunk
   migration that involves that collection starts, these migration stages
   must wait for the transaction to release the locks on the collection,
   thereby impacting the performance of chunk migrations.

   If a chunk migration interleaves with a transaction (for instance, if a
   transaction starts while a chunk migration is already in progress and
   the migration completes before the transaction takes a lock on the
   collection), the transaction errors during the commit and aborts.

   Depending on how the two operations interleave, some sample errors
   include (the error messages have been abbreviated):

   - ``an error from cluster data placement change ... migration commit in progress for <namespace>``

   - ``Cannot find shardId the chunk belonged to at cluster time ...``

---
ref: transactions-count
content: |

   To perform a count operation within a transaction, use the
   :pipeline:`$count` aggregation stage or the :pipeline:`$group` (with a
   :group:`$sum` expression) aggregation stage.

   MongoDB drivers compatible with the 4.0 features provide a
   collection-level API ``countDocuments(filter, options)`` as a helper
   method that uses the :pipeline:`$group` with a :group:`$sum` expression
   to perform a count. The 4.0 drivers have deprecated the ``count()`` API.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.0.3, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the
   :method:`db.collection.countDocuments()` helper method that uses the
   :pipeline:`$group` with a :group:`$sum` expression to perform a count.

---
ref: transactions-distinct
content: |

   To perform a distinct operation within a transaction:
      
   - For unsharded collections, you can use the
     :method:`db.collection.distinct()` method/the
     :dbcommand:`distinct` command as well as the aggregation pipeline
     with the :pipeline:`$group` stage.
  
   - For sharded collections, you cannot use the
     :method:`db.collection.distinct()` method or the
     :dbcommand:`distinct` command.

     To find the distinct values for a sharded collection, use the
     aggregation pipeline with the :pipeline:`$group` stage instead.
     For example:

     - Instead of ``db.coll.distinct("x")``, use
     
       .. code-block:: javascript
     
          db.coll.aggregate([ 
             { $group: { _id: null, distinctValues: { $addToSet: "$x" } } }, 
             { $project: { _id: 0 } } 
          ])
     
     - Instead of ``db.coll.distinct("x", { status: "A" })``, use:
     
       .. code-block:: javascript
     
          db.coll.aggregate([ 
             { $match: { status: "A" } },
             { $group: { _id: null, distinctValues: { $addToSet: "$x" } } }, 
             { $project: { _id: 0 } } 
          ])

     The pipeline returns a cursor to a document:

     .. code-block:: javascript
        :copyable: false

        { "distinctValues" : [ 2, 3, 1 ] }

     Iterate the cursor to access the results document.

   in :doc:`transactions </core/transactions>`.

---
ref: transactions-arbiters
content: |

   Transactions whose write operations span multiple shards will error
   and abort if any transaction operation reads from or writes to a
   shard that contains an arbiter.

   See also |disabledrcmaj| for transaction restrictions on shards that
   have disabled read concern majority.
---
ref: transactions-committed-visibility
content: |
   
   Until a transaction commits, the data changes made in the
   transaction are not visible outside the transaction.

   However, when a transaction writes to multiple shards, not all
   outside read operations need to wait for the result of the committed
   transaction to be visible across the shards. For example, if a
   transaction is committed and write 1 is visible on shard A but write
   2 is not yet visible on shard B, an outside read at read concern
   :readconcern:`"local"` can read the results of write 1 without
   seeing write 2.

---
ref: transactions-multi-shard-block-external-reads
content: |
   
   During the commit for a transaction, outside read operations may try
   to read the same documents that will be modified by the transaction.
   If the transaction writes to multiple shards, then during the commit
   attempt across the shards
   
   - Outside reads that use read concern :readconcern:`snapshot` or
     :readconcern:`"linearizable"`, or are part of causally consistent
     sessions (i.e. include :ref:`afterClusterTime <afterClusterTime>`)
     wait for all writes of a transaction to be visible.

   - Outside reads using other read concerns do not wait for all writes
     of a transaction to be visible but instead read the
     before-transaction version of the documents available.
