===============================================
Reconfigure a Replica Set when Members are Down
===============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To reconfigure a :term:`replica set` when only a *minority* of members
are down or unreachable, run the :method:`rs.reconfig()` command on the
current :term:`primary`. For examples of how to reconfigure a replica
set using :method:`rs.reconfig()`, see
:ref:`replica-set-reconfiguration-usage`.

To reconfigure a replica set when a *majority* of the members are down
or unreachable, you must manually change the set configuration as
described in the procedures in this tutorial. Use the procedure
appropriate to your version and situation.

Reconfiguring when a majority of members are down can include
situations where you have a network partition and where neither side of
the partition has a majority. In such cases the two sides of the
partition cannot see each other when determining whether a majority
exists (see :ref:`replica-set-elections-and-network-partitions`). In
these situations, never use scripts to reconfigure but instead
reconfigure manually, as described in the procedures here.

.. index:: replica set; reconfiguration
.. _replica-set-force-reconfiguration:

Reconfigure by Forcing the Reconfiguration
------------------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 2.0

This procedure lets you recover while a majority of :term:`replica set`
members are down or unreachable. You connect to any surviving member and
use :method:`rs.reconfig()`'s ``force`` option to force a
reconfiguration of the replica set.

The ``force`` option manually reconfigures the set. The option is
intended only for serious problems, such as a disaster recovery
failover. Do not use ``force`` for more routine reconfigurations. Also,
do not use ``force`` in any automatic scripts and do not use ``force``
when there is still a primary.

To force reconfiguration:

1. Back up a surviving member.

#. Connect to a surviving member and save the current configuration.
   Consider the following example commands for saving the configuration:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg = rs.config()

      printjson(cfg)

#. On the same member, remove the down and unreachable members of the
   replica set from the :data:`members <rs.conf.members>` array by
   setting the array equal to the surviving members alone. Consider the
   following example, which uses the ``cfg`` variable created in the
   previous step:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cfg.members = [cfg.members[0] , cfg.members[4] , cfg.members[7]]

#. On the same member, reconfigure the set by using the
   :method:`rs.reconfig()` command with the ``force`` option set to
   ``true``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.reconfig(cfg, {force : true})

   The replica set elects a new primary, most likely the member you are
   connected to.

   .. note:: When you use ``force : true``, the version number in the
      replica set configuration increases significantly, by tens or
      hundreds of thousands. This is normal and designed to prevent set
      version collisions if network partitioning ends.

#. If the failure or partition was only temporary, the removed members
   will detect that they have been removed from the set. If any of the
   removed members come back online, there is the chance they will elect
   a new primary, resulting in two primaries. To ensure that the removed
   members do not elect a new primary, shut down or decommission the
   removed members as soon as possible.

Reconfigure by Replacing the Replica Set
----------------------------------------

The procedures here are intended mainly for MongoDB versions *prior to*
version 2.0. For post-2.0 version, the above procedure,
:ref:`replica-set-force-reconfiguration`, is recommended.

These procedures are for situations where a *majority* of the
:term:`replica set` members are down or unreachable. If a majority is
*running*, then skip these procedures and instead use the
:method:`rs.reconfig()` command according to the examples in
:ref:`replica-set-reconfiguration-usage`.

If you run a pre-2.0 version and a majority of your replica set is down,
you have the two options described here. Both involve replacing the
replica set.

Reconfigure by Turning Off Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option replaces the :term:`replica set` with a :term:`standalone` server.

1. Stop the surviving :program:`mongod` instances.

#. Perform a backup.

#. Move each surviving member's data directory to an archive folder. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mv /data/db /data/db-old

   .. optional:: You may remove the data instead.

#. Restart one of the :program:`mongod` instances *without* the
   ``--replSet`` parameter.

   You are back online with a single server that is not a replica set
   member. Clients can use this server for both reads and writes.

Reconfigure by "Breaking the Mirror"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option selects a surviving :term:`replica set` member to be the new
:term:`primary` and to be the "seed" for a new replica set. All other
members must resync from this new primary.

1. Stop the surviving :program:`mongod` instances.

#. Perform a backup.

#. Move each surviving member's data directory to an archive folder. For example:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mv /data/db /data/db-old

   .. optional:: You may remove the data instead.

#. Restart all :program:`mongod` instances with the new replica set name.

#. On the new primary, add the other instances as members of the replica
   set. For more information, see :doc:`/tutorial/expand-replica-set`.
