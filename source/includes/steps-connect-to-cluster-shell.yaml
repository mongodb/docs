  |service| only allows client connections to the cluster from entries in the
  :ref:`project's whitelist <whitelist>`.
  
  |service| displays any entries already on the project whitelist in the
  :guilabel:`Connect` modal under :guilabel:`Check the IP Whitelist`. If you
  do not see the IP address of your client on the list, you can:
    
  * Click :guilabel:`Add Entry` to add a single IP address or a CIDR-notated
    range of addresses. 
    
    For |service| clusters deployed on :ref:`amazon-aws` *and* using :ref:`VPC
    Peering <vpc-peering>`, you can add a Security Group associated with the
    peer :abbr:`VPC (Virtual Private Connection)`.
    
  * Click :guilabel:`Add Current IP Address` to add your current IP address. 
  
  * Click :guilabel:`Allow Access From Anywhere` to allow access from any IP
    address.
    
    .. warning::
       
       Using :guilabel:`Allow Access From Anywhere` results in all clusters in
       the |service| project being publically accessible. Consider the security
       risks of having public-facing MongoDB clusters before using this option.

title: "Select :guilabel:`Connect with the Mongo Shell`."
level: 4
ref: connect-details
content: |

  The :guilabel:`Connect` dialog displays operating system-specific
  instructions for downloading the latest version of the :program:`mongo
  <bin.mongo>` shell for the |service| cluster, as well as the full command
  for connecting to the |service| cluster with the :program:`mongo
  <bin.mongo>` shell.

  a. Follow the instructions in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog to download and
     install the latest version of the :program:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell.

  #. Select the connection string for your :program:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell
     version:

     - For version 3.6 or later, click :guilabel:`I am using shell 3.6 or later`.
     
     - For version 3.4 or earlier, click 
       :guilabel:`I am using shell 3.4 or earlier`.
  
     To check which version of the :program:`mongo <bin.mongo>` shell
     is installed on your system, run the following command from the
     terminal:

     .. code-block:: bash

        mongo --version
  
  #. Copy and paste the connection string into a terminal or command line
     interface. Do not execute the command yet.
  
     The connection string includes the user name of a MongoDB user set up for the
     project for authentication purposes. Replace the ``<PASSWORD>`` placeholder
     with this user's password. Once you have updated the ``PASSWORD``, you
     can execute the command to connect to the |service| cluster.

     To connect with a different MongoDB user, update the ``--username`` and
     ``--password`` parameters with the username and password of a different
     MongoDB user.
