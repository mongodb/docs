.. dbcommand:: cleanupOrphaned

   .. versionadded:: 2.5.3

   :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` is an admin command that incrementally
   deletes :term:`orphaned data <orphaned document>`, or those
   documents on a shard that have shard key values that do not fall
   within the ranges of the :term:`chunks <chunk>` owned by that
   shard. Delete operations use a :term:`write concern` of ``w:
   majority``.

   Run :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` directly on the :program:`mongod`
   instance on the primary replica set member of the shard. Do not
   run :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` from a :program:`mongos` instance.

   :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         cleanupOrphaned: "<database>.<collection>",
         "startingAtKey": <minimumShardKeyValue>,
         "secondaryThrottle": true
      }

   :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` has the following fields:

   .. include:: /reference/command/cleanupOrphaned-field.rst

Required Access
---------------

On systems running with :setting:`auth`, you must have
:authrole:`clusterAdmin` privileges to run
:dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned`.

Behavior
--------

You do not need to disable the balancer before running
:dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned`.

Do not run :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` from :program:`mongos` instances:
instead, run :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` while connected directly to
the :program:`mongod` that is currently the primary replica set member
of the shard.

Output
------

Return Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` command returns a document containing
a subset of the following fields:

.. data:: cleanupOrphaned.ok

   Equal to ``1`` on success.

   A value of ``1`` indicates that :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` scanned
   the specified shard key range, deleted any orphaned documents
   found in that range, and confirmed that all deletes replicated to a
   majority of the members of that shard's replica set. If confirmation
   does not arrive within 1 hour, :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned`
   times out.

   A value of ``0`` could indicate either of two cases:

   - :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` found orphaned documents on the
     shard but could not delete them.

   - :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` found and deleted orphaned
     documents, but could not confirm replication before the 1
     hour timeout. In this case, replication does occur, but only
     after :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` returns.

   .. important::

      Do not use the value of :data:`cleanupOrphaned.ok` as an indicator
      that :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` found or deleted any documents.

.. data:: cleanupOrphaned.startingAtKey

   :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` examines documents from a single
   contiguous range of shard keys that do not correspond to any chunks
   on a given shard, and deletes all documents found within that range.

   :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` selects the next range containing
   the :data:`~cleanupOrphaned.startingAtKey` that is not in the range
   of any chunk on the shard. :data:`~cleanupOrphaned.startingAtKey`
   defaults to ``MinKey``.

.. data:: cleanupOrphaned.stoppedAtKey

   The upper bound of the cleaned range of shard keys. Corresponds to
   the lower bound of the next chunk on the shard. It does not indicate
   that :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` found or deleted any documents.

Interpreting Log Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the :program:`mongod` log file to interpret how many orphaned documents
:dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` deleted. Relevant lines resemble the following:

.. code-block:: none

   m30000| 2013-10-31T15:17:28.972-0400 [conn1] Deleter starting delete for: foo.bar from { _id: -35.0 } -> { _id: -10.0 }, with opId: 128
   m30000| 2013-10-31T15:17:28.972-0400 [conn1] rangeDeleter deleted 0 documents for foo.bar from { _id: -35.0 } -> { _id: -10.0 } { "stoppedAtKey" : { "_id" : -10 }, "ok" : 1 }

Remove Orphaned Ranges from a Shard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the output of the :dbcommand:`cleanupOrphaned` in a loop to
remove orphaned documents from all sharded key index ranges on a shard:

Run the following code in the :program:`mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use admin
   var nextKey = {};
   while (
            nextKey = db.runCommand( { cleanupOrphaned : "admin.user",
                                       startingFromKey : "nextKey" } ).stoppedAtKey
         ) { printjson(nextKey); }

Specify a Different Initial Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``admin`` database, with a sharded ``info`` collection, given
a shard that has only a single chunk, where :method:`sh.status`
reports the following range:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { x : 1 } => { x : 10 }

The shard has two ranges not owned by the chunk:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { x : MinKey } => { x : 1 }

   { x : 10 } => { x : MaxKey }

Use one of the following commands to clean up the first range:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "cleanupOrphaned": admin.info,
      "startingAtKey": { x : 0 },
      "secondaryThrottle": true
   }

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "cleanupOrphaned": admin.info,
      "secondaryThrottle": true
   }

To clean the second range, use one of the following commands:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "cleanupOrphaned": admin.info,
      "startingAtKey": { x : 2 },
      "secondaryThrottle": true
   }

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "cleanupOrphaned": admin.info,
      "startingAtKey": { x : 10 },
      "secondaryThrottle": true
   }
