   Building an index in a rolling fashion reduces the resiliency of your cluster and
   increases index build times. We only recommend using rolling index builds when regular
   index builds do not meet your needs.

   If you decide to continue with a rolling index, consider that they must meet certain
   conditions to succeed. To ensure your index build succeeds, avoid the following design
   patterns that commonly trigger a restart loop:

   - Index key exceeds the :manual:`index key limit 
     </reference/limits/#mongodb-limit-Index-Key-Limit>`
   - :manual:`Index name </indexes/#index-names>` already exists
   - Index on :manual:`more than one array field 
     </core/index-multikey/#compound-multikey-indexes>`
   - Index on collection that has the 
     :manual:`maximum number of text indexes 
     </reference/limits/#mongodb-limit-Number-of-Indexes-per-Collection>`
   - Text index on collection that has the
     :manual:`maximum number of text indexes 
     </core/index-text/#one-text-index-per-collection>`

.. note::

   The {+atlas-ui+} doesn't support building indexes with a rolling build
   for ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and {+Flex-clusters+}. You can't build
   indexes with a rolling build for {+Serverless-instances+}.

For workloads which cannot tolerate performance decrease due to index 
builds, consider building indexes in a rolling fashion.

To maintain {+cluster+} availability:

- |service| removes one node from the {+cluster+} at a time
  starting with a :term:`secondary <secondary>`.

- More than one node can go down at a time, but |service| always keeps 
  a majority of the nodes online.

|service| automatically cancels rolling index builds 
that don't succeed on all nodes. When a rolling index build completes 
on some nodes, but fails on others, |service| cancels the build
and removes the index from any nodes that it was successfully built on. 

In the event of a rolling index build cancellation,
|service| generates an :ref:`activity feed event <view-activity-feed>`
and sends a notification email to the project owner 
with the following information:

- Name of the {+cluster+} on which the rolling index build failed
- Namespace on which the rolling index build failed
- Project that contains the {+cluster+} and namespace
- Organization that contains the project
- Link to the :ref:`activity feed event <view-activity-feed>`

To learn more about rebuilding indexes, see :manual:`Build Indexes on
Replica Sets </tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets>`.

.. note::

   :manual:`Unique 
   </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex#options-for-all-index-types>` 
   :manual:`index options 
   </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/#options>` are 
   incompatible with building indexes in a rolling fashion. If you specify ``unique`` in the :guilabel:`Options`
   pane, |service| rejects your configuration with an error message.
