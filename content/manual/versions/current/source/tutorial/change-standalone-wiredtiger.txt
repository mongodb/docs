Change a Self-Managed Standalone to WiredTiger
==============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. note::

   You must upgrade to WiredTiger. MongoDB removed the deprecated MMAPv1 storage 
   engine in version 4.2. 

Use this tutorial to change the storage engine of a :term:`standalone`
MongoDB instance to :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`.

Considerations
--------------

``mongodump`` and ``mongorestore``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial uses the :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and
:binary:`~bin.mongorestore` utilities to export and import data.

- Ensure that these MongoDB package components are installed and
  updated on your system.

- Make sure you have sufficient drive space available for the
  :binary:`~bin.mongodump` export file and the data files of your new
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance running with WiredTiger.

Default Bind to Localhost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-default-bind-ip-change.rst

The tutorial runs :binary:`~bin.mongodump` and
:binary:`~bin.mongorestore` from the same host as the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` they are connecting to. If run remotely,
:binary:`~bin.mongodump` and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` must specify
the ip address or the associated hostname in order to connect to the
:binary:`~bin.mongod`.

XFS and WiredTiger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the WiredTiger storage engine, using XFS for data bearing nodes is
recommended on Linux. For more information, see
:ref:`prod-notes-linux-file-system`.
