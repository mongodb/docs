This document provides a basic introduction to using the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. See :doc:`/installation` for instructions on
installing MongoDB for your system.

Start the ``mongo`` Shell
-------------------------

To start the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and connect to your :doc:`MongoDB
</reference/mongod>` instance running on **localhost** with **default port**:

#. Go to your ``<mongodb installation dir>``:

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd <mongodb installation dir>

#. Type ``./bin/mongo`` to start :binary:`~bin.mongo`:

   .. code-block:: sh

      ./bin/mongo

   If you have added the ``<mongodb installation dir>/bin`` to the
   ``PATH`` environment variable, you can just type ``mongo`` instead
   of ``./bin/mongo``.

#. To display the database you are using, type ``db``:

   .. code-block:: sh

      db

   The command should return ``test``, which is the default database.
   To switch databases, issue the ``use <db>`` command, as in the
   following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use <database>

   To list the available databases, use the command ``show dbs``. See
   also :ref:`mongo-shell-getSiblingDB` to access a different database
   from the current database without switching your current database
   context (i.e. ``db.``.)

To start the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell with other options, see
:ref:`examples of starting up mongo <mongo-usage-examples>` and
:doc:`mongo reference </reference/mongo>` which provides details on the
available options.

.. note::

   When starting, :binary:`~bin.mongo` checks the user's :envvar:`HOME`
   directory for a JavaScript file named :ref:`.mongorc.js
   <mongo-mongorc-file>`. If found, :binary:`~bin.mongo` interprets the
   content of :file:`.mongorc.js` before displaying the prompt for the
   first time. If you use the shell to evaluate a JavaScript file or
   expression, either by using the :option:`--eval <mongo --eval>` option on the
   command line or by specifying :ref:`a .js file to mongo
   <mongo-shell-file>`, :binary:`~bin.mongo` will read the ``.mongorc.js``
   file *after* the JavaScript has finished processing.

.. _mongo-shell-executing-queries:

Executing Queries
-----------------

From the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, you can use the :doc:`shell methods
</reference/javascript>` to run queries, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.<collection>.find()

- The ``db`` refers to the current database.

- The ``<collection>`` is the name of the collection to query. See
  :ref:`mongo-shell-help-collection` to list the available collections.

  If the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell does not accept the name of the
  collection, for instance if the name contains a space, hyphen, or
  starts with a number, you can use an alternate syntax to refer to
  the collection, as in the following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db["3test"].find()

     db.getCollection("3test").find()

- The :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` method is the JavaScript
  method to retrieve documents from ``<collection>``. The
  :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` method returns a
  :term:`cursor` to the results; however, in the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
  shell, if the returned cursor is not assigned to a variable, then the
  cursor is automatically iterated up to 20 times to print up to the
  first 20 documents that match the query. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
  will prompt ``Type it`` to iterate another 20 times.

  You can set the ``DBQuery.shellBatchSize`` attribute to change the
  number of iteration from the default value ``20``, as in the
  following example which sets it to ``10``:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     DBQuery.shellBatchSize = 10;

  For more information and examples on cursor handling in the
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, see :ref:`read-operations-cursors`.

  See also :ref:`mongo-shell-help-cursor` for list of
  cursor help in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, see:

- :doc:`/applications/read`

- :doc:`/core/read-operations`
- :doc:`/core/write-operations`

.. _mongo-shell-print:

Print
-----

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell automatically prints the results of the
:method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` method if the returned cursor
is not assigned to a variable. To format the result, you can add the
``.pretty()`` to the operation, as in the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.<collection>.find().pretty()

In addition, you can use the following explicit print methods in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

- ``print()`` to print without formatting

- ``print(tojson(<obj>))`` to print with :term:`JSON` formatting and
  equivalent to ``printjson()``

- ``printjson()`` to print with :term:`JSON` formatting and equivalent
  to ``print(tojson(<obj>))``

Use a Custom Prompt
-------------------

You may modify the content of the prompt by creating the variable
``prompt`` in the shell. The prompt variable can hold strings as well
as any arbitrary JavaScript. If ``prompt`` holds a function that returns a
string, :binary:`~bin.mongo` can display dynamic information in each
prompt. Consider the following examples:

.. example::

   Create a prompt with the number of commands issued in the current
   session, define the following variables:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      cmdCount = 1;
      prompt = function() {
                   return (cmdCount++) + "> ";
               }

   The prompt would then resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      1> db.collection.find()
      2> show collections
      3>

.. example::

   To create a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell prompt in the form of
   ``<database>@<hostnane>$`` define the following variables:

   .. code-block:: javascript

       host = db.serverStatus().host;

       prompt = function() {
                    return db+"@"+host+"$ ";
                }

   The prompt would then resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      <database>@<hostname>$ use records
      switched to db records
      records@<hostname>$

.. example::

   To create a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell prompt that contains the system
   up time *and* the number of documents in the current database,
   define the following prompt variable:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      prompt = function() {
                   return "Uptime:"+db.serverStatus().uptime+" Documents:"+db.stats().objects+" > ";
               }

   The prompt would then resemble the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

       Uptime:5897 Documents:6 > db.people.save({name : "James"});
       Uptime:5948 Documents:7 >

Use an External Editor in the ``mongo`` Shell
---------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.2

In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell you can use the ``edit`` operation to
edit a function or variable in an external editor. The ``edit``
operation uses the value of your environments ``EDITOR`` variable.

At your system prompt you can define the ``EDITOR`` variable and start
:binary:`~bin.mongo` with the following two operations:

.. code-block:: bash

   export EDITOR=vim
   mongo

Then, consider the following example shell session:

.. code-block:: javascript

   MongoDB shell version: 2.2.0
   > function f() {}
   > edit f
   > f
   function f() {
       print("this really works");
   }
   > f()
   this really works
   > o = {}
   { }
   > edit o
   > o
   { "soDoes" : "this" }
   >

.. note::

   As :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell interprets code edited in an external
   editor, it may modify code in functions, depending on the
   JavaScript compiler. For :binary:`~bin.mongo` may convert ``1+1`` to
   ``2`` or remove comments. The actual changes affect only the
   appearance of the code and will vary based on the version of
   JavaScript used but will not affect the semantics of the code.

.. _mongo-shell-exit:

Exit the Shell
--------------

To exit the shell, type ``quit()`` or use the ``<Ctrl-c>`` shortcut.
