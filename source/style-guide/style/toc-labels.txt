Table of Contents (TOC) labels refer to the headings or titles used to 
represent the various sections or pages of our documentation in the 
TOC. The TOC provides an organized list of the documentation's 
structure and content.

Each entry in the TOC typically includes a label or heading that 
corresponds to a section or page in the documentation. These labels 
give users a quick overview of the topics covered and help them 
navigate to specific parts of the documentation more efficiently.

When you create a TOC, you can generate these labels automatically 
based on the titles of your pages, or specify labels that differ from 
the page title.

Page titles and Table of Contents (TOC) labels serve distinct purposes. 
We should craft them with different considerations.

TOC labels and page titles can match. However, we should define them 
separately even when they match for added flexibility. This approach 
ensures that we can easily implement any future changes without 
affecting the other element. Separate definitions for TOC labels and 
page titles contribute to organized content management and a seamless 
user experience.

While both page titles and TOC labels contribute to the overall user 
experience, page titles focus more on attracting users and SEO, while 
TOC labels prioritize representing the document's structure and aiding 
in navigation within the document itself.

Page Titles
-----------

- Optimize page titles for search engines. They should include relevant 
  keywords to improve the page's discoverability in search results. To 
  learn more, see :ref:`seo-guidelines`.

- Create succinct, meaningful, descriptive page titles, and place the 
  most important words first. Page titles should have a maximum of 70 
  characters and provide a quick overview of the content. Search 
  results or browser tabs might truncate extra long titles. Avoid 
  excessive or irrelevant words (keyword stuffing).

- While we should craft concise titles, include enough information to 
  confirm to the user that they have landed in the right place. A page 
  title can provide more detail than a TOC label.

- Ensure that each title and heading is unique. Identical titles, even 
  between documentation sets, might compete in search results.

- Don't include "MongoDB" in a title unless the page is a product 
  landing page.

- Aim to attract users and encourage them to click on the link. Include 
  phrases users might search for, or tasks they might want to 
  accomplish.

- Create page titles that are readable and effective on various 
  devices, including mobile. This involves considering character limits 
  and readability on smaller screens.

- Use a consistent grammatical structure, style, and tone across all 
  page titles to maintain a unified and professional appearance. For 
  example, use verbs to indicate procedural content.

TOC Labels
----------

- While the automatic labels make it easier for writers to 
  update the TOC as the content evolves, long titles interfere with 
  efficient navigation. We recommend that you specify TOC labels to 
  enhance the document's accessibility and usability.

- Craft clear and descriptive TOC labels that convey the content of 
  each section or page accurately. Users should understand the context 
  from the TOC label and its placement in the overall TOC hierarchy.

- Ensure your TOC label fits on a single line of text. Let the 
  placement of the TOC label in the overall TOC hierarchy provide 
  context. Avoid redundancy and repetition. The page title itself can 
  provide more detail and confirm to the user that they have landed in 
  the right place. To this end, you can use industry standard 
  abbreviations and the ampersand when needed.

  .. important::

     In favor of brevity, TOC labels do allow for the the ampersand ( & ) symbol.

- Don't stray so far from the original page title that you disorient 
  the user.

- TOC labels should follow a logical order that reflects the 
  documentation's flow. You might include numbering or an order that 
  makes sense for the documentation's purpose.

- TOC labels primarily aid user navigation. Users should be able to 
  quickly locate and go to specific sections of interest.

- In technical documentation, TOC labels may use specialized technical 
  terminology and acronyms to accurately represent the content within 
  each section or page.

- If a tutorial page uses an action-oriented TOC label, and that label fits on one line,
  use the action-oriented label. Note that a child page can "inherit" an action from a 
  parent page; for example, if the parent TOC label is "Query", you can label its child
  pages "Arrays," "Nested Documents," etc., without repeating "Query" in the child labels.
  
  If an action-oriented TOC label doesn't fit on one line, use a shorter,
  non-action-oriented label.

  Don't use action-oriented TOC labels for reference pages.
