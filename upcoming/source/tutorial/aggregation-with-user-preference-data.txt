Data Model
----------

Consider a sports club database with a ``members`` collection that
tracks members' names, join dates, and sport preferences:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.insertMany( [
      {
         _id: "jane",
         joined: ISODate("2011-03-02"),
         likes: ["golf", "racquetball"]
      },
      {
         _id: "joe",
         joined: ISODate("2012-07-02"),
         likes: ["tennis", "golf", "swimming"]
      },
      {
         _id: "ruth",
         joined: ISODate("2012-01-14"),
         likes: ["golf", "racquetball"]
      },
      {
         _id: "harold",
         joined: ISODate("2012-01-21"),
         likes: ["handball", "golf", "racquetball"]
      },
      {
         _id: "kate",
         joined: ISODate("2012-01-14"),
         likes: ["swimming", "tennis"]
      }
   ] )


Return a Single Field
---------------------

The following operation uses :pipeline:`$project` to return only the
``_id`` field for all documents in the ``members`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.aggregate(
      [
         { $project: { _id: 1 } }
      ]
   )

The operation returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
      { _id: 'jane' },
      { _id: 'joe' },
      { _id: 'ruth' },
      { _id: 'harold' },
      { _id: 'kate' }
   ]


For basic query and projection operations, standard queries with the
:method:`find() <db.collection.find()>` method have the best performance. 

Normalize and Sort Documents
----------------------------

The following operation returns member names in upper case and in
alphabetical order. You might do this to normalize member names for
processing.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.aggregate(
     [
       { $project: { name: { $toUpper: "$_id" }, _id: 0 } },
       { $sort: { name: 1 } }
     ]
   )

All documents from the ``members`` collection pass through the
pipeline, which consists of the following operations:

- The :pipeline:`$project` operator:

  - creates a new field called ``name``.

  - converts the value of the ``_id`` to upper case, with the
    :expression:`$toUpper` operator. Then the
    :pipeline:`$project` creates a new field, named ``name``
    to hold this value.

  - suppresses the ``id`` field. :pipeline:`$project` will pass
    the ``_id`` field by default, unless explicitly suppressed.

- The :pipeline:`$sort` operator orders the results by the
  ``name`` field.

The operation returns the following result:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
      { name: 'HAROLD' },
      { name: 'JANE' },
      { name: 'JOE' },
      { name: 'KATE' },
      { name: 'RUTH' }
   ]

Return Usernames Ordered by Join Month
--------------------------------------

The following aggregation operation returns member names sorted by the
month they joined. You might use this aggregation to help generate
membership renewal notices.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.aggregate( [
       { 
         $project: {
            month_joined: { $month: "$joined" },
            name: "$_id",
            _id: 0
          }
       },
       { $sort: { month_joined: 1 } }
   ] )

The pipeline passes all documents in the ``members`` collection through
the following operations:

- The :pipeline:`$project` operator:

  - Creates two new fields: ``month_joined`` and ``name``.

  - Suppresses the ``id`` from the results. The :method:`aggregate()
    <db.collection.aggregate()>` method includes the ``_id``, unless
    explicitly suppressed.

- The :expression:`$month` operator converts the values of the
  ``joined`` field to integer representations of the month. Then the
  :pipeline:`$project` operator assigns those values to the
  ``month_joined`` field.

- The :pipeline:`$sort` operator sorts the results by the
  ``month_joined`` field.

The operation returns the following result: 

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
      { month_joined: 1, name: 'ruth' },
      { month_joined: 1, name: 'harold' },
      { month_joined: 1, name: 'kate' },
      { month_joined: 3, name: 'jane' },
      { month_joined: 7, name: 'joe' }
   ]

Return Total Number of Joins per Month
--------------------------------------

The following operation shows how many people joined each month of the
year. You might use this aggregated data for recruiting and marketing
strategies.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.aggregate( [
      { $project: { month_joined: { $month: "$joined" } } } ,
      { $group: { _id: { month_joined: "$month_joined" } , number: { $sum: 1 } } },
      { $sort: { "_id.month_joined": 1 } }
   ] )

The pipeline passes all documents in the ``members`` collection through
the following operations:

- The :pipeline:`$project` operator creates a new field called
  ``month_joined``.

- The :expression:`$month` operator converts the values of the
  ``joined`` field to integer representations of the month. Then the
  :pipeline:`$project` operator assigns the values to the
  ``month_joined`` field.

- The :pipeline:`$group` operator collects all documents with a
  given ``month_joined`` value and counts how many documents there are
  for that value. Specifically, for each unique value,
  :pipeline:`$group` creates a new "per-month" document with two
  fields:

  - ``_id``, which contains a nested document with the
    ``month_joined`` field and its value.

  - ``number``, which is a generated field. The :group:`$sum`
    operator increments this field by 1 for every document containing
    the given ``month_joined`` value.

- The :pipeline:`$sort` operator sorts the documents created by
  :pipeline:`$group` according to the contents of the
  ``month_joined`` field.

The aggregation operation returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   [
      { _id: { month_joined: 1 }, number: 3 },
      { _id: { month_joined: 3 }, number: 1 },
      { _id: { month_joined: 7 }, number: 1 }
   ]

Return the Five Most Common "Likes"
-----------------------------------

The following aggregation collects the top five most "liked" activities
in the data set. This type of analysis could help inform planning and
future development.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.aggregate(
     [
       { $unwind: "$likes" },
       { $group: { _id: "$likes" , number: { $sum: 1 } } },
       { $sort: { number: -1 } },
       { $limit: 5 }
     ]
   )

The pipeline begins with all documents in the ``members`` collection,
and passes these documents through the following operations:

- The :pipeline:`$unwind` operator separates each value in the
  ``likes`` array, and creates a new version of the source document
  for every element in the array.

  .. example::

     Given the following document from the ``members`` collection:

     .. code-block:: javascript
        :copyable: false

        {
          _id: "jane",
          joined: ISODate("2011-03-02"),
          likes: ["golf", "racquetball"]
        }

     The :pipeline:`$unwind` operator outputs the following
     documents:

     .. code-block:: javascript
        :copyable: false

        {
          _id: "jane",
          joined: ISODate("2011-03-02"),
          likes: "golf"
        }
        {
          _id: "jane",
          joined: ISODate("2011-03-02"),
          likes: "racquetball"
        }

- The :pipeline:`$group` operator collects all documents with the same
  value for the ``likes`` field and counts each grouping. With this
  information, :pipeline:`$group` creates a new document with two
  fields:

  - ``_id``, which contains the ``likes`` value.

  - ``number``, which is a generated field. The :group:`$sum`
    operator increments this field by 1 for every document containing
    the given ``likes`` value.

- The :pipeline:`$sort` operator sorts these documents by the
  ``number`` field in reverse order.

- The :pipeline:`$limit` operator only includes the first 5 result
  documents.

The aggregation operation returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
      { _id: 'golf', number: 4 },
      { _id: 'racquetball', number: 3 },
      { _id: 'tennis', number: 2 },
      { _id: 'swimming', number: 2 },
      { _id: 'handball', number: 1 }
   ]
