MongoDB on Azure brings the power of the leading next-generation
database to Microsoft’s flexible, open, and scalable cloud.

`Microsoft Azure <http://azure.microsoft.com/>`_ is an open and
flexible cloud platform that enables you to quickly build, deploy, and
manage applications across a global network of Microsoft-managed
datacenters. You can build applications using any language, tool, or
framework. You can also integrate your public cloud applications with
your existing IT environment.

Together, MongoDB and Azure provide customers the tools to build
limitlessly scalable applications in the cloud.

Other Deployment Options
------------------------

Users interested in deploying MongoDB directly on Azure can do so
using Azure VM (Azure Infrastructure-as-a-Service) on Linux or
Windows, or Azure Worker Roles (Azure Platform-as-a-Service) on
Windows.

Presentations
-------------

Users deploying MongoDB on Azure may be interested in the following
presentations:

- `MongoDB Paris 2012: MongoDB on Azure <http://www.mongodb.com/presentations/mongodb-paris-2012/mongodb-on-azure>`_
- `MongoNYC 2012: MongoDB on Windows Azure <http://www.mongodb.com/presentations/mongonyc-2012-mongodb-windows-azure>`_
- `Hands-On: Deploying MongoDB on Azure <http://www.mongodb.com/presentations/mongosv-2011/hands-on-deploying-mongodb-on-azure>`_

Deployment Recommendations
--------------------------

For all MongoDB deployments using Azure, you **must** mount volume
that hosts the :program:`mongod` instance's :setting:`~storage.dbPath`
with the *Host Cache Preference* ``READ/WRITE``.

This applies to all Azure deployments, using any guest operating
system.

If your volumes have inappropriate cache settings, MongoDB may
eventually shut down with the following error:

.. code-block:: none

   [DataFileSync] FlushViewOfFile for <data file> failed with error 1 ...
   [DataFileSync] Fatal Assertion 16387

These shut downs do not produce data loss if when
:setting:`storage.journal.enabled` is set to ``true``. You can safely
restart :program:`mongod` at any time following this event.

The performance characteristics of MongoDB may change with
``READ/WRITE`` caching enabled.

The TCP keepalive on the Azure load balancer is 240 seconds by
default, which can cause it to silently drop connections if the TCP
keepalive on your Azure systems is greater than this value.  You
should set ``tcp_keepalive_time`` to 120 to ameliorate this problem.

**On Linux systems**:

- To view the keep alive setting, you can use one of the following
  commands:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time

  Or:

  .. code-block:: sh

     cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time

  The value is measured in seconds.

- To change the ``tcp_keepalive_time`` value, you can use one of the
  following command:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=<value>

  Or:

  .. code-block:: sh

     echo <value> | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time

  These operations do not persist across system reboots. To persist the
  setting, add the following line to ``/etc/sysctl.conf``:

  .. code-block:: sh

     net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = <value>

  On Linux, :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` processes limit the
  keepalive to a maximum of 300 seconds (5 minutes) on their own
  sockets by overriding keepalive values greater than 5 minutes.

**For Windows systems**:

- To view the keep alive setting, issue the following command:

  .. code-block:: powershell

     reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters /v KeepAliveTime

  The registry value is not present by default. The system default,
  used if the value is absent, is 7200000 *milliseconds* or
  ``0x6ddd00`` in hexadecimal.

- To change the ``KeepAliveTime`` value, use the following command in
  an Administrator :guilabel:`Command Prompt`, where ``<value>`` is
  expressed in hexadecimal (e.g. ``0x0124c0`` is 120000):

  .. code-block:: powershell

     reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\ /v KeepAliveTime /d <value>

  Windows users should consider the `Windows Server Technet Article on
  KeepAliveTime
  <https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc957549.aspx>`_ for
  more information on setting keep alive for MongoDB deployments on
  Windows systems.
