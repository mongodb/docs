      The balancer will not activate in the ``stopped`` state.
      To ensure that the  balancer
      is not ``stopped``, use :method:`sh.startBalancer()`,
      as in the following:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sh.startBalancer()
    post: |
      The balancer will not start if you are outside
      of the ``activeWindow`` timeframe.

action:

      Set the ``activeWindow`` using :method:`~db.collection.updateOne()`,
      as in the following:
    language: sh
    code: |
      db.settings.updateOne(
         { _id: "balancer" },
         { $set: { activeWindow : { start : "<start-time>", stop : "<stop-time>" } } },
         { upsert: true }
      )
    post: |
      Replace ``<start-time>`` and ``<end-time>`` with time values using
      two digit hour and minute values (i.e. ``HH:MM``) that specify the
      beginning and end boundaries of the balancing window.

      - For ``HH`` values, use hour values ranging from ``00`` - ``23``.
      - For ``MM`` value, use minute values ranging from ``00`` - ``59``.

      For on-premises or self-managed sharded clusters, MongoDB evaluates the 
      start and stop times relative to the time zone of the primary member in 
      the config server replica set.

      For Atlas clusters, MongoDB evaluates the start and stop times 
      relative to the UTC timezone.

      .. note::

         The balancer window must be sufficient to *complete* the
         migration of all data inserted during the day.

         As data insert rates can change based on activity and usage
         patterns, it is important to ensure that the balancing window
         you select will be sufficient to support the needs of your
         deployment.
