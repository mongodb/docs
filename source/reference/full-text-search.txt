|service-fullname|'s |fts| feature offers fine-grained text indexing to
enable advanced search functionality without any additional management
required. |fts| provides options for several kinds of :ref:`text
analyzers <analyzers-ref>`, score-based results ranking, and a rich
:ref:`query language <query-syntax-ref>`. 

.. note::

   |fts| is available only on |service|. Non-|service| MongoDB
   deployments can use :manual:`text indexing </core/index-text/>`.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with |fts|, you'll need an |service| cluster of size
``M30`` or larger. For complete instructions on setting up a full-text
index, see :ref:`ref-create-index`.

Find out more about:

:ref:`Analyzers <analyzers-ref>`
  Analyzers control the way your full-text index is constructed. You
  can select an analyzer to customize your index to make the best use
  of a particular language's vocabulary and grammar, or to create an
  index which is language-neutral.

:ref:`Index Definition Format<ref-data-types>`
  You can customize your index definition to take advantage of
  :ref:`static and dynamic <static-dynamic-mappings>` field mappings.

:ref:`The $searchBeta Aggregation Pipeline Stage <query-syntax-ref>`
  Construct |fts| queries with the ``$searchBeta``
  :manual:`aggregation pipeline </aggregation>` stage. Find reference
  pages for the ``$searchBeta`` operators with examples here.
