|cloudgov| is a fully-managed cloud database for the U.S. government 
(federal agencies and state, local, and education (SLED) entities),
developed by the same people that build MongoDB.

|cloudgov|, or |cloudgov-short|, supports a subset of the commercial
`MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/>`__ features and some 
unique features. To learn more, see :ref:`<supported-features>`.

Using the |cloudgov-short| Documentation
------------------------------------------

This documentation provides tutorials for common tasks, broad 
comparisons between |cloudgov-short| features and their commercial 
|service| equivalents, and reference material for features unique to 
|cloudgov-short|.

Many procedures and reference materials are identical across 
|cloudgov-short| and commercial |service|. In those cases, this 
documentation provides links to the |service| documentation.
**We recommend opening Atlas links in a new browser tab to save your place in the MongoDB AtlasGov documentation.**

Links to the |service| documentation are presented:

-  At the end of a section to expand on the topic, after highlighting 
   |cloudgov-short| differences you should keep in mind, or

- As :guilabel:`Tips` for optional further reading on a topic.
