M2/M5 Tier Backup Options
-------------------------

Backups are automatically enabled for ``M2`` and ``M5`` shared-tier
clusters and cannot be disabled. For more information, see
:doc:`/backup/m2-m5-snapshots`.

M10+ Tier Backup Options
------------------------

To enable backups for an ``M10+`` |service| cluster, toggle
:guilabel:`Turn on Backup (M10 and up)` to ``Yes``.
If enabled, |service| takes snapshots of your databases at
regular intervals and retains them according to your project's
:ref:`retention policy <retention-policy>`.

|service| provides the following backup options for ``M10+``
clusters:

   * - Backup Option
     - Description

   * - :doc:`/backup/continuous-backups`

     - |service| takes incremental snapshots of data in your cluster
       and allows you to :doc:`restore </restore-cluster>` from stored
       snapshots or from a selected point in time within the last 24
       hours. You can also
       :doc:`query a continuous backup snapshot </query-backup>`.

       Each project has *one* backup data center location dictated by
       the *first* backup-enabled cluster created in that project. See
       :ref:`continuous-snapshot-storage-location` for more
       information.

   * - :doc:`/backup/cloud-provider-snapshots`

     - |service| takes either full copy snapshots (for Azure-backed
       clusters) or incremental snapshots (for AWS and GCP-backed
       clusters) of data in your cluster
       and allows you to restore from those snapshots. |service|
       stores snapshots in the same cloud provider region as the
       replica set member targeted for snapshots.
