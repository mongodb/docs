title: Create or Login To An Atlas User Account
ref: process-mongodb
level: 4
stepnum: 1
content: |
  Atlas is MongoDB's cloud-based, database-as-a-service solution.
  In order to use MongoDB in the cloud, you need to create an Atlas user account.
  
  Go to `cloud.mongodb.com
  <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user#/atlas/login>`_ to create or login to
  your user account.
  
  If you are creating your user account, as part of the process Atlas automatically creates 
  a default :doc:`organization and project
  </organizations-projects>` for you to deploy your first cluster. You
  can add additional :doc:`organizations </tutorial/manage-organizations>` and
  :doc:`projects </tutorial/manage-projects>` later.

  Now it's time to select your cluster tier. In this guide we will be
  setting up a free-tier or ``M0`` cluster.

  Ensure that the ``Cloud Provider and Region`` dropdowns have ``Amazon
  Web Services`` and either ``N. Virginia (us-east-1)`` or ``Frankfurt
  (eu-central-1)`` selected.

     :scale: 20 %

  Scroll down and click on the ``Cluster Tier`` section. For the free
  tier cluster, select the ``M0`` cluster. You can only create one free
  tier (``M0``) cluster per account.

  .. warning::
     The M0 cluster is not recommended for production applications.

title: Create an administrative Username and Password
ref: admin-setup
level: 5
stepnum: 6
content: |
  
  Atlas prompts you to create an administrative MongoDB user as a part
  of deploying the first Atlas cluster in the project. This user has
  administrative access to any MongoDB cluster you deploy in the Atlas
  project.

  Fill in the ``username`` and ``password`` fields. The password should
  be random, long, and complex to ensure system security and to impede
  malicious access.
