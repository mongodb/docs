MongoDB Compatibility
---------------------

{+sink-connector-title}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+sink-connector+} requires MongoDB v3.6 or later.

{+source-connector-title}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+source-connector+} requires MongoDB v3.6 or later.

If you are using MongoDB v3.6, the connector can only listen for
changes on **collections**. If you need the connector to listen for
changes on a **database** or **deployment**, you must use
MongoDB v4.0 or later.

.. note::

   We recommend that you only use the {+mkc+} with an official version
   of the MongoDB server. We cannot guarantee it functions correctly
   with any other version.

Kafka Compatibility
-------------------

The {+mkc+} requires Kafka Connect v2.1.0 or later. It's
tested against Apache Kafka v2.3 and later. You can use the Kafka
Connect service with several Apache Kafka compatible platforms including
the following:

- Confluent Platform v5.3 or later
- Microsoft Azure Event Hubs
- Red Hat AMQ Streams

The {+mkc+} works directly with {+kafka-connect+}. The connector does not
connect directly to a Kafka cluster which means it's compatible with any
Apache Kafka platform that supports {+kafka-connect+}.

If you have any questions about the {+mkc+}, ask them on the 
`MongoDB Community Forums
<https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/c/data/connectors-integrations/>`__.
