To find and return query results, MongoDB uses one of the following
query engines:

- The classic query engine

- The {+sbe+}, which is available for some queries starting in MongoDB
  5.1.

MongoDB automatically selects the engine to execute the query. In
MongoDB versions earlier than 8.0, you cannot manually specify an engine
for a particular query. Starting in MongoDB 8.0, you can use
query settings to specify an engine for queries. For details, see
:dbcommand:`setQuerySettings`.

MongoDB can use the {+sbe+} for a subset of queries provided certain
conditions are met. In most cases, the {+sbe-short+} provides improved
performance and lower CPU and memory costs compared to the classic query
engine.

MongoDB uses the classic engine for queries that are ineligible for the
{+sbe+}.

Eligible Queries for the {+sbe-short-title+}
----------------------------------------------------

MongoDB determines eligibility for using the {+sbe-short+} on a per-query basis, 
and considers support for each operator and expressions present in the query. 
For example, two common pipelines that use {+sbe-short+} are aggregations with 
:pipeline:`$group` or :pipeline:`$lookup` stages. However, support for the 
{+sbe-short+} is version specific and actively changing.

To see whether your query used the {+sbe-short+}, refer to the 
:ref:`sbe-determine-query-engine` section.

Determine which Query Engine was Used
-------------------------------------

There are a few ways to determine whether the classic engine or the
{+sbe-short+} was used to execute a query.

Check Query Explain Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The explain results for a query differ based on
which query engine was used. For example, explain results for queries
executed using the {+sbe-short+} include the 
:data:`explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.slotBasedPlan` field.

For more information about the differences in explain results between
query engines, see :ref:`explain-output-structure`.

Check Slow Query Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/sbe/fact-slow-ops-logs.rst

To see an example log message for a query that used the {+sbe-short+},
see :ref:`log-message-json-examples-slow-op`.
