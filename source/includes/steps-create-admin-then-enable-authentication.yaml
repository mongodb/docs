title: Start MongoDB without access control.
stepnum: 1
level: 4
ref: start-without-auth
pre: |
  For example, the following starts a standalone :program:`mongod` instance
  without access control.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db1
---
stepnum: 2
title: Connect to the instance.
level: 4
ref: connect
pre: |
   For example, connect a :program:`mongo` shell to the instance.
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongo --port 27017 
post: |
   Specify additional command line options as appropriate to connect the
   :program:`mongo` shell to your deployment, such as ``--host``.
---
stepnum: 3
title: Create the user administrator.
level: 4
ref: create-user-admin
pre: |
  In the ``admin`` database, add a user with the
  :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role. For example, the following
  creates the user ``myUserAdmin`` in the ``admin`` database:
action:
  pre: |
    .. note::
       The database where you create the user (in this example,
       ``admin``) is the user's :ref:`authentication database
       <user-authentication-database>`. Although the user would
       authenticate to this database, the user can
       have roles in other databases; i.e. the user's authentication
       database does not limit the user's privileges.
  language: javascript
  code: |
    use admin
    db.createUser(
      {
        user: "myUserAdmin",
        pwd: "abc123",
        roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
      }
    )
post: |
  Disconnect the :program:`mongo` shell.
---
title: Re-start the MongoDB instance with access control.
level: 4
stepnum: 4
ref: restart-with-auth
pre: |
  Re-start the :program:`mongod` instance with the ``--auth`` command
  line option or, if using a configuration file, the
  :setting:`security.authorization` setting.
  
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongod --auth --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db1
post: |
  Clients that connect to this instance must now authenticate
  themselves as a MongoDB user. Clients can only perform actions as
  determined by their assigned roles.
---
title: Connect and authenticate as the user administrator.
level: 4
stepnum: 5
ref: auth-as-admin
action:
  - pre: |
      Using the :program:`mongo` shell, you can:

      - Connect with authentication by passing in user credentials, or

      - Connect first withouth authentication, and then issue the
        :method:`db.auth()` method to authenticate.
  - heading: To authenticate during connection
    pre: |
        Start a :program:`mongo` shell with the ``-u <username>``, ``-p
        <password>``, and the ``--authenticationDatabase <database>``
        command line options:
         
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongo --port 27017 -u "myUserAdmin" -p "abc123" --authenticationDatabase "admin"

  - heading:  To authenticate after connecting
    pre: |
      Connect the :program:`mongo`
      shell to the :program:`mongod`:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongo --port 27017
  - pre: |
      Switch to the authentication database (in this case, ``admin``),
      and use :method:`db.auth(\<username\>, \<pwd\>) <db.auth()>`
      method to authenticate:
    language: javascript
    code: |
         use admin
         db.auth("myUserAdmin", "abc123" )
---
title: Create additional users as needed for your deployment.
level: 4
stepnum: 6
ref: create-additionalusers
pre: |
  Once authenticated as the user administrator, use
  :method:`db.createUser()` to create additional users. You can assign
  any :doc:`built-in roles </core/security-built-in-roles>` or
  :doc:`user-defined roles </core/security-user-defined-roles>` to the
  users.

  The ``myUserAdmin`` user only has privileges to :doc:`manage users
  and roles </tutorial/manage-users-and-roles>`. As ``myUserAdmin``, if
  you attempt to perform any other operations, such as read from a
  ``foo`` collection in the ``test`` database, MongoDB returns an error.

action:
  pre: |
    The following operation adds a user ``myTester`` to the ``test``
    database who has :authrole:`readWrite` role in the ``test``
    database as well as :authrole:`read` role in the ``reporting``
    database.

    .. note::
       The database where you create the user (in this example,
       ``test``) is that user's :ref:`authentication database
       <user-authentication-database>`. Although the user would
       authenticate to this database, the user can have roles in other
       databases; i.e. the user's authentication database does not limit
       the user's privileges.
  language: javascript
  code: |
    use test
    db.createUser(
      {
        user: "myTester",
        pwd: "xyz123",
        roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "test" },
                 { role: "read", db: "reporting" } ]
      }
    )
---
title: Connect and authenticate as ``myTester``.
level: 4
ref: auth-as-mytester
action:
  - heading: To authenticate during connection
    pre: |
        Start a :program:`mongo` shell with the ``-u <username>``, ``-p
        <password>``, and the ``--authenticationDatabase <database>``
        command line options:
         
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongo --port 27017 -u "myTester" -p "xyz123" --authenticationDatabase "test"

  - heading:  To authenticate after connecting
    pre: |
      Connect the :program:`mongo`
      shell to the :program:`mongod`:
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongo --port 27017
  - pre: |
      Switch to the authentication database (in this case, ``test``),
      and use :method:`db.auth(\<username\>, \<pwd\>) <db.auth()>`
      method to authenticate:
    language: javascript
    code: |
         use test
         db.auth("myTester", "xyz123" )
  - heading: Insert into a collection as ``myTester``.
    pre: |
       As ``myTester``, you have privileges to perform read and write
       operations in the ``test`` database (as well as perform read
       operations in the ``reporting`` database). For example, you can
       peform the following insert operation in the ``test`` database:
    language: sh
    code: |
       db.foo.insert( { x: 1, y: 1 } )
...
