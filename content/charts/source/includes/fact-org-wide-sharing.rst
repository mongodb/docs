Organization-wide sharing grants users in your organization, including 
users who are not members of your project, permission to view data in a 
deployment that is used for dashboards shared with your organization.

You can enable organization-wide sharing 
:ref:`for an entire deployment <org-sharing-deployment>` or 
:ref:`for a specific data source <org-sharing-data-source>`.
