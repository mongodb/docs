.. note::

   Although "code example" and "snippet" are often used interchangeably, this
   guidance uses "snippet" specifically to refer to a context-less block of code.
   See :ref:`code-category-snippet` for more information.

We categorize code examples into the following types:

- :ref:`Usage Examples <code-category-usage-example>`: Standalone code blocks
  that show how to perform a task, including the relevant setup and context.
- :ref:`Snippets <code-category-snippet>`: Code that illustrates a specific
  concept or detail within the context of a larger example, tutorial, or reference
  page.
- :ref:`Sample Applications <code-category-sample-app>`: Runnable applications
  demonstrating broader use cases.

.. _code-category-usage-example:

Usage Examples
--------------

Usage examples are self-contained, actionable code blocks that show how to
accomplish a specific task using MongoDB tools, drivers, or APIs. 

Usage examples include enough information to understand, modify, and run the code
contained in the code block. For example, a single code block that contains
declared variables, comments, descriptive placeholders, and other information
necessary to run the code:

.. code-block:: csharp

   using MongoDB.Driver;

   // Replace the following with your MongoDB connection string
   const string connectionUri = "mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>/?connectTimeoutMS=10000";

   var client = new MongoClient(connectionUri);

.. _code-category-snippet:

Snippets
--------

Snippets are narrowly scoped code blocks that help explain a specific concept
or detail. Snippets are typically used as part of a broader explanation or
tutorial, and are often meaningful only within that context.

Snippets are intended to provide information. They are *not* required to be valid
or runnable code. In some cases, snippets may contain intentionally
incomplete or incorrect code for demonstration purposes (for example, a snippet
showing all possible arguments for a command).

Snippets can be one of the following subtypes:

Non-MongoDB Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A command-line (CLI) command for any non-MongoDB tooling (for example, ``mkdir``, 
``cd``, or ``npm``), commonly used in the context of a tutorial.

These are most often used alongside :ref:`usage examples <code-category-usage-example>`
as an intermediary step to complete a task.

.. code-block:: shell
   :caption: Non-MongoDB command

   dotnet run MyCompany.RAG.csproj

Syntax Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of the syntax or structure for an API method, an Atlas CLI command, 
a ``mongosh`` command, or other MongoDB tooling. These are commonly used in
reference pages or sections.

Unlike :ref:`usage examples <code-category-usage-example>`, syntax examples 
are intended for demonstration purposes and are *not* intended to be executed as written.
For example, a snippet showing all possible arguments for a command would be
intentionally non-executable code:

.. code-block:: text
   :caption: Syntax example

   db.collection.createIndex(
   {
      <field>: <sortOrder>
   },
   {
      collation:
         {
            locale : <locale>,
            strength : < 1 | 2 >
         }
      }
   )

.. note:: 

   Syntax examples often include placeholders that users should replace with actual values.    
   For more information on placeholders, see :ref:`code-example-guidelines`.

Example Return Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of an object, such as a JSON blob or sample document, returned after 
executing a corresponding piece of code. 

Example return objects are commonly included as the output of an 
``io-code-block``. To learn how to use an ``io-code-block``, see the 
:ref:`code-block-reference` reference.

.. code-block:: text
   :copyable: false
   :caption: Example return object

    A timeout occurred after 30000ms selecting a server.  
    
    Client view of cluster state is
    {
        ClusterId : "1",
        State : "Disconnected",
        Servers :
        [{
          ServerId: "{ ClusterId : 1, EndPoint : "localhost:27017" }",
          EndPoint: "localhost:27017",
          State: "Disconnected"
        }]
    }

.. note:: 

   Example return objects are usually not meant to be copied and executed. 
   To learn how to make a code block non-copyable, see :ref:`code-example-formatting`.

Configuration Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example of a configuration object, often represented in YAML or JSON, that
enumerates
parameters and their types. These can be part of a larger tutorial or provided as
a reference. For example, a config object that demonstrates a Terraform or Atlas CLI configuration
settings:

.. code-block:: ini
   :copyable: false
   :caption: Example configuration object

    apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
    kind: AtlasDeployment
    metadata:
    name: my-atlas-cluster
    spec:
    backupRef:
        name: atlas-default-backupschedule
        namespace: mongodb-atlas-system

.. note::

   Use your best judgment to determine whether a configuration object is meant
   to be copied and executed.
   To learn how to make a code block non-copyable, see :ref:`code-example-formatting`.

.. _code-category-sample-app:

Sample Applications
-------------------

Sample applications are complete, runnable programs that connect multiple
discrete pieces of code. Sample apps might include error handling, framework
integrations, or frontend UI elements. These are often provided as a companion to
a tutorial or guide, sometimes in a dedicated repository.

Sample apps are intended to be copied, modified, and executed by users, and can demonstrate
a more complex use case than a :ref:`usage example <code-category-usage-example>`.
