=========================
Replica Set Member States
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Each member of a replica set has a state.

States
------

Core States
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. replstate:: PRIMARY

   Members in :replstate:`PRIMARY` state accept write operations. A replica set has at most
   one primary at a time. [#edge-cases-2-primaries]_ A :replstate:`SECONDARY` member becomes primary
   after an :ref:`election <replica-set-elections>`. Members in the :replstate:`PRIMARY`
   state are eligible to vote.

.. replstate:: SECONDARY

   Members in :replstate:`SECONDARY` state replicate the primary's data set
   and can be configured to accept read operations. Secondaries are eligible to vote in
   elections, and may be elected to the :replstate:`PRIMARY` state if the
   primary becomes unavailable.

.. replstate:: ARBITER

   Members in :replstate:`ARBITER` state do not replicate data or accept write operations.
   They are eligible to vote, and exist solely to break a tie during
   elections. Replica sets should only have a member in the :replstate:`ARBITER` state
   if the set would otherwise have an even number of voting members, and could suffer
   from tied elections. There should only be at most one arbiter configured
   in any replica set. For considerations when using an arbiter, see
   :doc:`/core/replica-set-arbiter`.

See :doc:`/core/replica-set-members` for more information on core states.

Other States
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. replstate:: STARTUP

   Each member of a replica set starts up in :replstate:`STARTUP`
   state. :binary:`~bin.mongod` then loads that member's replica set configuration,
   and transitions the member's state to :replstate:`STARTUP2`. Members in
   :replstate:`STARTUP` are not eligible to vote, as they are not yet a recognized member of any replica set.

.. replstate:: STARTUP2

   Each member of a replica set enters the :replstate:`STARTUP2` state as
   soon as :binary:`~bin.mongod` finishes loading that member's
   configuration, at which time it becomes an active member of the replica set and is eligible to vote.
   The member then decides whether or not to undertake an initial sync.
   If a member begins an initial sync, the member remains in :replstate:`STARTUP2` until all
   data is copied and all indexes are built.  Afterwards, the member transitions to
   :replstate:`RECOVERING`.

.. replstate:: RECOVERING

   A member of a replica set enters :replstate:`RECOVERING` state when
   it is not ready to accept reads. The :replstate:`RECOVERING` state
   can occur during normal operation, and doesn't necessarily reflect
   an error condition.  Members in the :replstate:`RECOVERING` state
   are eligible to vote in elections, but are not eligible to enter the
   :replstate:`PRIMARY` state.

   A member transitions from :replstate:`RECOVERING` to :replstate:`SECONDARY`
   after replicating enough data to guarantee a consistent view of the data for
   client reads.  The only difference between :replstate:`RECOVERING`
   and :replstate:`SECONDARY` states is that :replstate:`RECOVERING`
   prohibits client reads and :replstate:`SECONDARY` permits them.
   :replstate:`SECONDARY` state does not guarantee anything about the
   staleness of the data with respect to the primary.

   Due to overload, a :term:`secondary` may fall far enough behind the
   other members of the replica set such that it may need to :doc:`resync
   </tutorial/resync-replica-set-member>` with the
   rest of the set. When this happens, the member enters the
   :replstate:`RECOVERING` state and requires manual intervention.

.. replstate:: ROLLBACK

   Whenever the replica set replaces a :term:`primary` in an
   election, the old primary may contain documents
   that did not replicate to the :term:`secondary`
   members. In this case, the old primary member reverts those writes. During
   :doc:`rollback </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`, the member will have
   :replstate:`ROLLBACK` state. Members in the :replstate:`ROLLBACK` state
   are eligible to vote in elections.

Error States
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Members in any error state can't vote.

.. replstate:: UNKNOWN

   Members that have never communicated status information to the replica
   set are in the :replstate:`UNKNOWN` state.

.. replstate:: DOWN

   Members that lose their connection to the replica set are seen as :replstate:`DOWN` by the remaining members of the set.

.. replstate:: REMOVED

   Members that are removed from the replica set enter the :replstate:`REMOVED`
   state.
   When members enter the :replstate:`REMOVED` state, the logs will
   mark this event with a ``replSet REMOVED`` message entry.
