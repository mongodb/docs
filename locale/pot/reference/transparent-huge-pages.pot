msgid "Transparent Huge Pages (THP) is a Linux memory management kernel module used to reduce the overhead of Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) lookups on machines with large amounts of memory, and therefore a large number of memory pages. In effect, it presents system memory as a smaller number of much larger pages rather than as a larger number of 4096-byte pages."
