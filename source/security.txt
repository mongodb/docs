Security
========

The documents in this section outline basic security practices and
risk management strategies. Additionally, this section includes
:ref:`tutorials` that outline basic network filter and firewall rules
to configure trusted environments for MongoDB.

Additionally, these documents describe the MongoDB role-based
access-control model. MongoDB provides user roles that authorize users
for different levels of access to databases and database
operations. For more information, see the reference pages listed at
the bottom of this page.

If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in MongoDB, please
see :doc:`/tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report`.
