  ``/etc/rc.local`` is a user-configurable script that is run at the end of
  post-boot system initialization. Add the following script lines to the file
  as ``root`` to disable THP upon each boot.
action:
  - language: sh
    code: |
      if test -f /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/defrag; then
        echo 0 > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/defrag
      fi
      if test -f /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag; then
        echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
      fi
      if test -f /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled; then
        echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
      fi

      These lines should immediately precede ``exit 0``, which should
      already be the last line in the file. Note that on Red Hat
      Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and potentially other Red Hat-based
      derivatives, ``transparent_hugepage`` in the paths in the script
      should be replaced by ``redhat_transparent_hugepages``.
