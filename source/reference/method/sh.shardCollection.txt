sh.shardCollection()
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: sh.shardCollection(collection,key,unique)

   :param string collection: The namespace of the collection to shard.

   :param document key: 

      A :term:`document` containing a :term:`shard key` that the
      sharding system uses to :term:`partition` and distribute objects
      among the shards.

   :param boolean unique: 

      When true, the ``unique`` option ensures that the underlying
      index enforces a unique constraint. :term:`Hashed shard keys
      <hashed shard key>` do not support unique constraints.

   Shards the named collection, according to the specified
   :term:`shard key`. Specify shard keys in the form of a :term:`document`.
   Shard keys may refer to a single document field, or more typically
   several document fields to form a "compound shard key."

   .. versionadded:: 2.4
      Use the form ``{field: "hashed"}`` to create a
      :term:`hashed shard key <hashed shard key>`.
      Hashed shard keys may not be compound indexes.
