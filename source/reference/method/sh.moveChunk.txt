.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. method:: sh.moveChunk(namespace, query, destination)

   Moves the chunk containing the document specified by the ``query``
   to the shard described by ``destination``.

   .. include:: /reference/method/sh.moveChunk-param.rst

   This method provides a wrapper around the
   :dbcommand:`moveChunk`. In most circumstances, allow the
   :term:`balancer` to automatically migrate :term:`chunks <chunk>`,
   and avoid calling :method:`sh.moveChunk()` directly.

   .. seealso:: :dbcommand:`moveChunk`, :method:`sh.splitAt()`,
      :method:`sh.splitFind()`, :doc:`/sharding`, and :ref:`chunk
      migration <sharding-chunk-migration>`.

Example
-------

Given the ``people`` collection in the ``records`` database, the
following command finds the chunk that contains the documents with the
``zipcode`` field set to ``53187`` and then moves that chunk to the
shard named ``shard0019``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   sh.moveChunk("records.people", { zipcode: 53187 }, "shard0019")
