Partition-Based Sync - React Native SDK
=======================================

Partition-Based Sync is an older mode for using Atlas Device Sync with the 
Realm React Native SDK. We recommend using 
:ref:`Flexible Sync <react-native-flexible-sync-fundamentals>` 
for new apps. The information on this page is for users who are still 
using Partition-Based Sync.

For more information about Partition-Based Sync and how to configure it
in Atlas App Services, refer to :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>`
in the App Services documentation.

.. _react-native-partition-based-sync-fundamentals:

Partition Value
---------------

When you select :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>` for your 
backend App configuration, your client implementation must include a 
partition value. This is the value of the :ref:`partition key 
<partition-key>` field you select when you configure Partition-Based Sync.

The partition value determines which data the client application can access.

You pass in the partition value when you open a synced realm.

.. _react-native-partition-sync-open-realm:

Configure a Partition-Based Sync Realm
--------------------------------------

To open a Flexible Sync realm, use ``@realm/react``'s ``createRealmContext()`` 
function and its returned ``RealmProvider``.

In a ``RealmProvider`` that's nested in a ``UserProvider``, add a ``sync`` 
property with a :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>` 
object that contains ``flexible: true``.

Note that ``UserProvider`` automatically passes an authenticated user
to ``RealmProvider``.

   :language: javascript

.. _react-native-copy-data-and-open-new-realm:

Copy Data and Open a New Realm
------------------------------

.. versionadded:: ``realm@10.14.0``

To copy data from an existing realm to a new realm with different
configuration options, pass the new configuration the
:js-sdk:`Realm.writeCopyTo() <Realm.html#writeCopyTo>` method.

.. include:: /includes/note-writecopy-same-type-sync-only.rst

In the new realm's configuration, you *must* specify the ``path``. 

If you write the copied realm to a realm file that already exists, the data is written object by object.
The copy operation replaces objects if there already exists objects for given primary keys.
The schemas of the realm you copy and the realm you are writing to must be 
compatible for the copy operation to succeed.
Only objects in the schemas of both configurations are copied over.

The configuration change can include modifications to :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>`: 

- Local realm to synced realm
- Synced Realm to local realm

The configuration change can also include changes to ``encryptionKey`` 
property of the ``Configuration``: 

- Encrypted realm to unencrypted realm
- Unencrypted realm to encrypted realm

You can also combine changes to configuration. For example, you can open a
local encrypted realm as a synced unencrypted realm or a unencrypted synced realm
as an encrypted synced realm.

.. _react-native-migrate-pbs-to-fs:

Migrate from Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync
--------------------------------------------------

You can migrate your App Services Device Sync Mode from Partition-Based Sync 
to Flexible Sync. Migrating is an automatic process that does not require 
any changes to your application code. Automatic migration requires Realm 
Node.js SDK version 11.10.0 or newer. 

Migrating enables you to keep your existing App Services users and 
authentication configuration. Flexible Sync provides more versatile permissions
configuration options and more granular data synchronization.

For more information about how to migrate your App Services App from 
Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync, refer to :ref:`Migrate Device Sync Modes 
<realm-sync-migrate-modes>`.

.. _react-native-update-client-code-after-pbs-to-fs-migration:

Updating Client Code After Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The automatic migration from Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync does not
require any changes to your client code. However, to support this 
functionality, Realm automatically handles the differences between the two 
Sync Modes by:

- Automatically creating Flexible Sync subscriptions for each object type 
  where ``partitionKey == partitionValue``.
- Injecting a ``partitionKey`` field into every object if one does not already 
  exist. This is required for the automatic Flexible Sync subscription.

If you need to make updates to your client code after migration, consider 
updating your client codebase to remove hidden migration functionality.
You might want update your client codebase when:

- You add a new model or change a model in your client codebase
- You add or change functionality that involves reading or writing Realm objects
- You want to implement more fine-grained control over what data you sync

Make these changes to convert your Partition-Based Sync client code to use 
Flexible Sync:

- Add ``flexible:true`` to your 
  :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>` object 
  where you :ref:`open a synced realm <react-native-flexible-sync-open-realm>`.
- Add relevant properties to your object models to use in your Flexible Sync 
  subscriptions. For example, you might add an ``ownerId`` property to enable
  a user to sync only their own data.
- Remove automatic Flexible Sync subscriptions and manually create the 
  relevant subscriptions.

For examples of Flexible Sync permissions strategies, including examples of 
how to model data for these strategies, refer to :ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide`.

Remove and Manually Create Subscriptions
````````````````````````````````````````

When you migrate from Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync, Realm
automatically creates hidden Flexible Sync subscriptions for your app. The 
next time you add or change subscriptions, we recommend that you:

1. :ref:`Remove the automatically-generated subscriptions <react-native-remove-subscription>`. 
2. :ref:`Manually add the relevant subscriptions in your client codebase <react-native-sync-add-subscription>`.

This enables you to see all of your subscription logic together in your 
codebase for future iteration and debugging.

For more information about the automatically-generated Flexible Sync 
subscriptions, refer to :ref:`realm-sync-migrate-client`.
