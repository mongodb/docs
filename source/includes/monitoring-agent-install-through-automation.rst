If you use |mms| :ref:`Automation <automation>`, install or update the
Monitoring Agent through |mms|.

To install the agent, click :guilabel:`Deployment`, then :guilabel:`Servers`,
then click a server's ellipsis icon (:guilabel:`...`) and select
:guilabel:`Install Monitoring Agent`.

To update the agent, click the link |mms| provides when your agent is
out-of-date. When the agent needs updating, |mms| displays a warning on the
:guilabel:`Deployment` page and provides a link to perform the update.
