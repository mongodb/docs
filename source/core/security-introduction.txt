As with all software running in a networked environment, administrators
of MongoDB must consider security and risk exposures for a MongoDB
deployment. There are no magic solutions for risk mitigation, and
maintaining a secure MongoDB deployment is an ongoing process.

Defense in Depth
----------------

The documents in this section takes a *Defense in Depth* approach to
securing MongoDB deployments and addresses a number of different
methods for managing risk and reducing risk exposure.

The intent of a *Defense In Depth* approach is to ensure there are no
exploitable points of failure in your deployment that could allow an
intruder or un-trusted party to access the data stored in the MongoDB
database. The easiest and most effective way to reduce the risk of
exploitation is to run MongoDB in a trusted environment, limit access,
follow a system of least privilege, and follow best development and
deployment practices.

Trusted Environments
--------------------

The most effective way to reduce risk for MongoDB deployments is to
run your entire MongoDB deployment, including all MongoDB components
(i.e. :binary:`~bin.mongod`, :binary:`~bin.mongos` and application instances)
in a *trusted environment*. Trusted environments use the following
strategies to control access:

- Use network filter (e.g. firewall) rules that block all connections
  from unknown systems to MongoDB components.

- Bind :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances to specific
  IP addresses to limit accessibility.

- Limit MongoDB programs to non-public local networks, and virtual
  private networks.

Operational Practices to Reduce Risk
------------------------------------

You may further reduce risk by :doc:`controlling access
</core/access-control>` to the database by employing authentication and
authorization. Require :ref:`authentication <authentication>` for
access to MongoDB instances and require strong, complex, single purpose
authentication credentials. This should be part of your internal
security policy. Employ :ref:`authorization <authorization>` and deploy
a model of least privilege, where all users have *only* the amount of
access they need to accomplish required tasks and no more. See
:doc:`/core/access-control` for more information.

Follow the best application development and deployment practices, which
includes: validating all inputs, managing sessions, and
application-level access control.

Always run the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` process as a
*unique* user with the minimum required permissions and access. Never
run a MongoDB program as a ``root`` or administrative users. The
system users that run the MongoDB processes should have robust
authentication credentials that prevent unauthorized or casual access.

To further limit the environment, you can run the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
:binary:`~bin.mongos` process in a ``chroot`` environment. Both user-based
access restrictions and ``chroot`` configuration follow recommended
conventions for administering all daemon processes on Unix-like
systems.

Data Encryption
---------------

To support audit requirements, you may need to encrypt data stored in
MongoDB. For best results, you can encrypt this data in the application
layer by encrypting the content of fields that hold secure data.

Additional Security Strategies
------------------------------

MongoDB provides various strategies to reduce network risk, such as
configuring MongoDB or configuring firewalls for MongoDB. See
:doc:`/core/security-network` for more information.

In addition, consider the strategies listed in
:doc:`/core/security-interface` to reduce interface-related risks for
the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, HTTP status interface and the REST API.

MongoDB Enterprise supports authentication using Kerberos. See
:doc:`/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication`.
