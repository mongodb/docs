This guide shows you how to configure federated authentication 
using |idp-provider| as your |idp|.

After integrating |idp-provider| and |service|, you can use your 
company's credentials to log in to |service| and other MongoDB cloud 
services.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use |idp-provider| as an |idp| for |service|, you must have:

- A |idp-provider| subscription. To obtain a subscription, visit
  `PingOne <https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/solutions/pingone-for-workforce.html>`__.
- A |idp-provider| user with administrative privileges. To grant a user
  administrative privileges, see 
  `Managing administrators <https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingone/p1_c_manage_administrators>`__.
  Alternatively, you cam use the default administrative user created
  upon activation of your |idp-provider| account.

Procedures

Configure |idp-provider| as an Identity Provider  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the |idp-provider| admin console to configure |idp-provider| as a
|saml| |idp|.

.. include:: /includes/procedures/idp-add-ping-one-as-idp.rst

.. include:: /includes/map-domain.rst

.. include:: /includes/associate-domain-map-org.rst

.. _ping-one-map-org:

(Optional) Map an Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :guilabel:`Federation Management Console` to assign your
domain's users access to specific |service| organizations:

.. include:: /includes/steps/manage-organization-mapping.rst

(Optional) Configure Advanced Federated Authentication Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the following advanced options for federated
authentication for greater control over your federated users and
authentication flow:

- :ref:`bypass-saml`

.. note::

   The following advanced options for federated authentication require
   you to :ref:`map an organization <ping-one-map-org>`.

- :ref:`advanced-option-default-role`
- :ref:`restrict-org-access-by-domain`
- :ref:`restrict-fed-user-membership`

Sign in to |service| Using Your Login URL
-----------------------------------------

All users that you assign to the |idp-provider| application can log in
to |service| using their |idp-provider| credentials on the 
:guilabel:`Login URL`. Users have access to the organizations you 
mapped to your |idp|.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/use-alternate-idp-multiple-mapped-domains.rst

If you select a default organization role, new users who log in to
|service| using the :guilabel:`Login URL` have the role you specify.
