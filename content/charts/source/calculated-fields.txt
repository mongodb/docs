   :description: Create calculated fields in MongoDB Charts by combining data from existing fields using expressions or operators for enhanced data analysis.

You can combine data from one or more fields in your collection into
a single calculated field. For example, you can:

- Convert a field in hours to seconds or in degrees Farenheit to Celsius
- Multiply a price field by a quantity field to create a total
- Combine multiple line items within an array to calculate a total 

Considerations
--------------

- You can only create calculated fields from data within the same
  document.
- You can't :ref:`convert the type <convert-field-data-types>` of a
  calculated field through the |charts| interface. However, you can use
  :manual:`Type Expression Operators
  </meta/aggregation-quick-reference/#type-expression-operators>` in a
  calculated field's definition.
- Once you create a calculated field, you can :ref:`modify
  <edit-calculated-field>` its definition but not its name. However, you
  can :ref:`remove <remove-calculated-field>` and recreate the field if
  you need to rename it.

Create a Calculated Field
-------------------------

You create a calculated field by combining the data of existing fields
through simple expressions or :abbr:`MQL (MongoDB Query Language)`
:ref:`agg-quick-ref-operator-expressions`.

.. note::

   The definition of a calculated field can contain either simple
   expression language or operator expression language. You can't use 
   both simple and operator expression language in the same definition.

To create a calculated field:

1. In the corner of the :guilabel:`Fields` pane, click
   :icon-fa5:`plus`:guilabel:`Add Field`.

#. Select :guilabel:`Calculated`.

#. Enter the :guilabel:`Field Name` of the calculated field you want to
   define. You can specify a nested field by using dot notation. For
   example, ``metadata.target``.

#. Enter the :guilabel:`Value Expression` using :ref:`simple expression
   <calc-field-simple>` language or
   :ref:`agg-quick-ref-operator-expressions`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save Field`.

The calculated field appears in italics in the :guilabel:`Fields` pane.

Simple Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the following simple expression language in a calculated
field.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Expression Language
     - Example

   * - Field names
     - | ``orderTotal``
       | ``'orderTotal'``
       | ``"orderTotal"``
   
   * - Literal numbers
     - | ``2``
       | ``0.5``
   
   * - Mathematical operators
     - | ``+``
       | ``-``
       | ``*``
       | ``/``

   * - Brackets
     - ``( )``

Whitespace that is outside of quoted strings is not included in the 
expression.

   :alt: Click "Add Field", enter a field name and simple expressions definition, then click "Save Field".

.. example::

   The following examples are valid simple expressions to define a
   calculated field.

   Add the ``bathrooms`` field to the ``bedrooms`` field:

   .. code-block:: json

      bathrooms + bedrooms

   Multiply the ``total amount`` field by 1.1:

   .. code-block:: json

      'total amount' * 1.1

   Subtract ``32`` from the ``sensor.temp`` field, then multiply by
   ``5`` and divide by ``9``:

   .. code-block:: json
      
      (sensor.temp - 32)*5/9

Operator Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use :ref:`agg-quick-ref-operator-expressions` to define more
complex calculated fields.

.. example::

   The following examples are valid operator expressions to define a
   calculated field.

   Multiply the ``price`` field by ``0.075``:

   .. code-block:: json

      { $multiply: [ "$price", 0.075 ] }

   Combine multiple line items fields in an array to calculate a 
   total:

   .. code-block:: json

      { $reduce: {
        input: '$items', initialValue: 0,
        in: { $sum : ["$$value",
          { $multiply: ["$$this.price", 
            "$$this.quantity"] }
        ] } } }

.. tip::
   
   You can use a calculated field in the definition of another
   calculated field.

   For example, if you create a ``salesTax`` calculated field with the
   following definition:

   .. code-block:: json
   
      { $multiply: [ "$price", 0.075 ] }

   You can then create a ``totalCost`` calculated field that uses the
   ``salesTax`` field in its definition:

   .. code-block:: json

      { $sum: ["$price", "$salesTax"] }

Literal Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set a calculated field's value to a string using the ``$literal``
operator.

.. example::
   
   The following field definition assigns a value of ``my string``:

   .. code-block:: json

      { $literal: "my string" }

.. _edit-calculated-field:

Edit a Calculated Field
-----------------------

You can modify the definition of a calculated field.

1. In the :guilabel:`Fields` pane, click the :guilabel:`Ellipsis (...)`
   next to the name of the calculated field you want to modify.

#. Select :guilabel:`Modify field`.

#. Update the :guilabel:`Value Expression`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save Field`.

If you are using the calculated field in a chart, the chart refreshes to
reflect the new calculated field definition.

.. figure:: /images/charts/calculated-field-modify.png
   :figwidth: 50%
   :alt: Click the ellipsis next to the field name, then click "Modify field".
   
.. _remove-calculated-field:

Remove a Calculated Field
-------------------------

When you remove a calculated field, |charts| resamples the data source,
updates the :guilabel:`Fields` pane, and refreshes your chart. If the
calculated field was used in encodings or filters, it remains in the
chart even after the field is removed from the :guilabel:`Fields` pane.

To remove a calculated field:

1. In the :guilabel:`Fields` pane, click the :guilabel:`Ellipsis (...)`
   next to the name of the calculated field you want to remove.

#. Select :guilabel:`Remove field`.

.. figure:: /images/charts/calculated-field-remove.png
   :figwidth: 50%
   :alt: Click the ellipsis next to the field name, then click "Remove field".
