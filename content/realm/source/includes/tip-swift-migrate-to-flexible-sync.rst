.. tip:: Migrate to Flexible Sync

   You can automatically migrate your App Services Device Sync Mode from 
   Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync. This enables you to take advantage
   of the more expressive and granular Flexible Sync subscriptions and 
   permissions to manage what synced data your users can read and write.
