===================================
Remove Monitoring Agents from |MMS|
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MMS displays active Monitoring Agents on the :guilabel:`Agents` page in in the
:guilabel:`Administration` tab. The page displays agents that have been active
in the last 24 hours. If an agent fails to report to MMS for more than 24
hours, MMS removes the agent from the :guilabel:`Agents` page.

To remove a Monitoring Agent from MMS, :ref:`stop the agent's process
<stop-monitoring-agent>` and then wait 24 hours.

To delete an agent from a Linux or OSX server, :ref:`first stop the agent's
process <stop-monitoring-agent>`, and then remove the
``mongodb-mms-monitoring-agent`` file from the directory to which it was
installed.

.. Is this necessary to document?:

.. If you delete a Monitoring Agent by removing it from your environment, thus
   removing it from MMS, also delete any alerts for the Monitoring Agent. For
   example, an **Agent Down** alert may trigger if MMS detects 0 Monitoring
   Agents, you have removed your Monitoring Agent, and have an active alert to
   notify you when a Monitoring Agent is down.
