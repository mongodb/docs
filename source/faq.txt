What if I can't connect to a MongoDB instance?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have trouble connecting to a MongoDB deployment, see
the :ref:`Connection Troubleshooting Guide <java-connection-troubleshooting>`
for possible solutions.

Why are there two types of ``MongoClient`` in the Java driver?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two types of ``MongoClient`` because we wanted a cleaner API
for new users that didn't have the confusion of including multiple CRUD
APIs. We wanted to ensure that the new CRUD API was available in a Java
package structure that would work well with Java module support
introduced in Java 9.

Which type of ``MongoClient`` should I use?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New applications generally use the
``com.mongodb.client.MongoClient`` interface, which supports:

- Configuration with ``MongoClientSettings`` and ``ConnectionString``.  You can create instances of this interface via factory methods defined in the ``com.mongodb.client.MongoClients`` class.
- CRUD API using ``MongoDatabase``, and from there, ``MongoCollection``

Use the ``com.mongodb.MongoClient`` class if you require support for the legacy API, which supports:

- Configuration with ``MongoClientOptions`` and ``MongoClientURI``
- CRUD API using ``DB``, and from there, ``DBCollection``.  You can access this API via the ``getDB()`` method.

For applications that require a mix of the new and legacy APIs, ``com.mongodb.MongoClient`` also supports:

- Configuration with ``MongoClientSettings`` and ``ConnectionString``, the only difference being that you create instances via constructors instead of a factory class.
- CRUD API using ``MongoDatabase``, and from there, ``MongoCollection``.  You can access this API via the ``getDatabase()`` method.

How do I use the ``MongoClientSettings`` class?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``MongoClientSettings`` class to specify configurations for
``MongoClient`` instances. To construct ``MongoClientSettings`` instances, use the
``MongoClientSettings.Builder`` class.

Here are the sections of our documentation that show how to perform different
tasks with the ``MongoClientSettings`` class:

- :ref:`Specify Multiple Hosts <mongo-client-settings-multiple-hosts>`
- :ref:`Enable TLS/SSL <tls-enable>`
- :ref:`Authenticate with Credentials <mongo-client-setting-with-mongo-credential-example>`
- :ref:`Enable Compression <enable-compression>`
- :ref:`Add Listeners For Driver and Database Events <listener-mongo-client-settings-example>`
- :ref:`Get the Default Codec Registry <get-default-codec-registry-example>`

For more information about the ``MongoClientSettings`` class, see the
`API Documentation for MongoClientSettings <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoClientSettings.html>`__.

.. _java-faq-connection-pool:

How Does Connection Pooling Work in the Java Driver?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every ``MongoClient`` instance has a built-in connection pool for each server
in your MongoDB topology. Connection pools open sockets on demand to
support concurrent MongoDB operations in your multi-threaded application.

The maximum size of each connection pool is set by the ``maxPoolSize`` option, which
defaults to ``100``. If the number of in-use connections to a server reaches
the value of ``maxPoolSize``, the next request to that server will wait
until a connection becomes available.

Each ``MongoClient`` instance opens two additional sockets per server in your
MongoDB topology for monitoring the server's state.

For example, a client connected to a 3-node replica set opens 6
monitoring sockets. It also opens as many sockets as needed to support
an application's threads on each server, up to
the value of ``maxPoolSize``. If ``maxPoolSize`` is ``100`` and the
application only uses the primary (the default), then only the primary
connection pool grows and there can be at most ``106`` total connections. If the
application uses a :ref:`read preference <java-read-write-pref>` to query the
secondary nodes, their pools also grow and there can be ``306`` total connections.

Additionally, connection pools are rate-limited such that each connection pool
can only create, at maximum, the value of ``maxConnecting`` connections
in parallel at any time. Any additional thread stops waiting in the
following cases:

- One of the existing threads finishes creating a connection, or
  an existing connection is checked back into the pool.
- The driver's ability to reuse existing connections improves due to
  rate-limits on connection creation.

You can set the minimum number of concurrent connections to
each server with the ``minPoolSize`` option, which defaults to ``0``.
The connection pool will be initialized with this number of sockets. If
sockets are closed due to any network errors, causing the total number
of sockets (both in use and idle) to drop below the minimum, more
sockets are opened until the minimum is reached.

You can set the maximum number of milliseconds that a connection can
remain idle in the pool before being removed and replaced with
the ``maxIdleTimeMS`` option, which defaults to ``0`` (no limit).

The following default configuration for a ``MongoClient`` works for most
applications:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoClient client = new MongoClient("<connection string>")

Create a client once for each process, and reuse it for all
operations. It is a common mistake to create a new client for each
request, which is very inefficient.

To support high numbers of concurrent MongoDB operations
within one process, you can increase ``maxPoolSize``. Once the pool
reaches its maximum size, additional threads wait for sockets
to become available.

The driver does not limit the number of threads that
can wait for sockets to become available and it is the application's
responsibility to limit the size of its pool to bound queuing
during a load spike. Threads wait for the amount of time specified in
the ``waitQueueTimeoutMS`` option, which defaults to ``120000``, or 120 seconds.

A thread that waits more than the length of time defined by
``waitQueueTimeoutMS`` for a socket raises a connection error. Use this
option if it is more important to bound the duration of operations
during a load spike than it is to complete every operation.

When ``MongoClient.close()`` is called by any thread, the driver
closes all idle sockets and closes all sockets that are in
use as they are returned to the pool.

How do I prevent the "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/mongodb/MongoClient" error?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might encounter a ``java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError`` exception when your
Java runtime environment cannot locate a class file at runtime. When you
attempt to run application code that uses the {+driver-long+}, you must include
the appropriate driver JAR files on the classpath.

If you receive this error after adding the {+driver-short+} JAR files to
your classpath, check the following items in your environment:

- The JAR files exist in the locations specified by the classpath.
- The classpath syntax is correct.
- If you define the classpath in an environment variable, the Java runtime
  environment uses that variable.
- If you use a dependency manager, it does not report any unresolvable conflicts.

.. tip::

   This error contains the package and class name, which can help you identify
   which driver JAR might be missing from your classpath. To locate the
   driver JAR that the error refers to, check each of the entries in the
   :ref:`API documentation <java-api-landing>`.


How do I prevent the "com.mongodb.MongoSecurityException" error?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your application might throw this exception if you specify invalid or
incorrectly formatted credentials when connecting to a MongoDB deployment.

If you receive this error when you attempt to connect to a MongoDB deployment,
check the following items in your code:

- The connection URI corresponds to the correct MongoDB deployment.
  To learn more about setting your connection URI, see :ref:`connection-uri`.

- The credentials for the authentication mechanism that you specified are
  correct. To learn how to specify your credentials, see the
  :ref:`java-authentication-mechanisms` section.
  
- The name of the authentication database that you specified is correct. To
  learn how to set up the users and roles for your MongoDB deployment, see
  `Manage Users and Roles <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/manage-users-and-roles/>`__
  in the Server documentation.

How do I prevent the "IllegalArgumentException: Invalid BSON field name" error?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your application might throw this exception if you pass an incorrectly formatted
document to an operation and you are using a driver version v4.7 or earlier.

.. note::

   In driver versions v4.8 and later, this error message was replaced by one
   that includes more specific details on what was incorrectly formatted.

For example, the driver throws this error when you call an update operation
and incorrectly omit the update operator as shown in the following code
example:

.. code-block:: java
   :emphasize-lines: 4
   :copyable: false

   // incorrectly formatted update document
   collection.updateOne(
       new Document().append("name", "fizz"),
       new Document().append("name", "buzz")
   );

To avoid this error, use the builder class for the appropriate operation.
The driver offers builder classes to create syntactically correct BSON for
MongoDB operations. The prior example can be correctly expressed using
the builder classes as shown in the following code example:

.. code-block:: java
   :emphasize-lines: 7
   :copyable: false

   // Builder class imports
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.*;
   import static com.mongodb.client.model.Updates.*;

   // ...

   collection.updateOne(eq("name", "fizz"), set("name", "buzz"));

To learn more about the available builders classes, see the :ref:`<java-builders>` documentation.


How do I prevent the "IllegalStateException: state should be: open" error?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might encounter this exception if you call an operation on a ``MongoClient``
instance that closed its connections to MongoDB. Once the ``close()`` method
is called on the ``MongoClient``, any further operation calls on that instance
throw this exception.

To avoid this exception, do not call operations on ``MongoClient`` instance
after any code that calls ``close()`` on it.

.. tip::

   The code that closes the ``MongoClient`` instance might be difficult to
   locate in certain cases. To locate potential sources of this exception,
   search for the following cases:

   - Calls to ``close()`` on a ``MongoClient`` instance
   - Operation calls on a ``MongoClient`` instance that are outside the scope
     of the try-with-resources statement in which the ``MongoClient`` is
     declared

   If your application uses a framework to manage the ``MongoClient``
   such as Spring Boot, check the documentation of the framework to locate the
   best practices for managing the connection behavior.

   To learn more about accessing MongoDB from Spring Boot, see
   `Spring Boot and MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.com/compatibility/spring-boot>`__.


POJOs
-----

Do I have to specify an ID field value myself?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, the ``PojoCodecProvider`` automatically generates an ObjectId.

Can the ID field be a compound key?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. For an example of this, see `our implementation <https://github.com/niccottrell/mongo-java-tests/blob/master/src/test/PojoCompoundIdTest.java>`_

Can I use polymorphism in a POJO accessor?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, by using a discriminator.

What is a discriminator?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A discriminator is a property that identifies a specific document
schema. You can use it for inheritance and storing multiple types of
documents within the same collection or parent document (if you embed
subdocuments).

For example, if you have an ``Event`` class that you extend in Java,
such as ``MachineEvent`` or ``NetworkEvent``, using a discriminator
identifies which class the ``PojoCodecProvider`` must use to
serialize and deserialize the document.

For more information, see the :ref:`POJO Customization guide
<pojo-discriminators>`.

Can I control serialization of ``LocalDate``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, the 3.7 Java driver adds native support for ``JSR-310 Instant``,
``LocalDate`` & ``LocalDateTime``.

Can I serialize a ``java.util.Date`` as a string in format **yyyy-mm-dd**?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, you can build your own codec for this class and add it to the registry.

Add the codec to the first in the list of providers, before the default codec
registry and before the ``PojoCodecProvider``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/faq/code-snippets/FaqExample.java
   :language: java
   :emphasize-lines: 3
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start myDateAsStringCodec
   :end-before: end myDateAsStringCodec

Can I make POJOs read/write directly to the field and not use the getters/setters at all?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the ``PojoCodecProvider`` to use the
``SET_PRIVATE_FIELDS_CONVENTION``, which sets a private field through
reflection if no public setter is available.

Can I mix private, protected, and public setters and getters?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. The native POJO codec assumes that getters/setters have the same
modifiers for each field.

For example, the following methods throws an exception during encoding:

.. code-block:: java

   private String getField();
   public String setField(String x);

How do I fix: "org.bson.codecs.configuration.CodecConfigurationException: Can't find a codec for class X."?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This exception means you must register a codec for the class since
there is none at the moment.

How do I specify the collection name for a particular POJO class? Is there an annotation?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no annotation. We recommend adding a static string in your class as shown:

.. code-block:: java

   public class Person {
      public static final String COLLECTION_NAME = "people";
   }

The following snippet specifies the collection name for a particular
POJO class:

.. code-block:: java

   database.getCollection(Person.COLLECTION_NAME, Person.class);

Legacy API
----------

.. _faq-legacy-connection:

How do I connect to my MongoDB instance with the legacy API?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows how to connect to a MongoDB instance with the
legacy API and the current API.

Imagine we are connecting to a collection that contains only this document:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {"_id": 1, "val": 1}

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Legacy API
      :tabid: legacy

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/LegacyAPI.java
         :language: java
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start legacy-api-example
         :end-before: end legacy-api-example

   .. tab:: Current API
      :tabid: current

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CurrentAPI.java
         :language: java
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start current-api-example
         :end-before: end current-api-example

The output of the preceding code snippet resembles the following:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {"_id": 1, "val": 1}

See the :ref:`Migrate from the Legacy API <java-legacy-api>` page
for a list of differences between the legacy and current API.

How do I use the legacy ``MongoClientOptions`` and ``MongoClientURI`` Classes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is an example showing how to use the legacy ``MongoClientOptions`` and
``MongoClientURI`` classes to set your write concern:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Legacy API
      :tabid: legacy

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/LegacyAPI.java
         :language: java
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start legacy-api-mongoclientoptions-example
         :end-before: end legacy-api-mongoclientoptions-example

   .. tab:: Current API
      :tabid: current

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CurrentAPI.java
         :language: java
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start current-api-mongoclientsettings-example
         :end-before: end current-api-mongoclientsettings-example
