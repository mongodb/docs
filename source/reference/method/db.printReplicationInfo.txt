db.printReplicationInfo()
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: db.printReplicationInfo()

   Prints a formatted report of the status of a :term:`replica set`
   from the perspective of the :term:`primary` set member if run on the
   primary. [#run-on-secondary]_ The displayed report formats the data
   returned by :method:`db.getReplicationInfo()`.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`db.printReplicationInfo()`
   .. |method-alternative| replace:: :method:`db.getReplicationInfo()`

   Use this method to check the size of the oplog for a given
   :term:`replica set` member, connect to the member in a :program:`mongo`
   shell and run the :method:`ds.printReplicationInfo()` method.

   The output displays the size of the oplog and the date ranges of the
   operations contained in the oplog. In the following example, the oplog
   is about 10MB and is able to fit about 26 hours (94400 seconds) of
   operations:

   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      configured oplog size:   10.10546875MB
      log length start to end: 94400 (26.22hrs)
      oplog first event time:  Mon Mar 19 2012 13:50:38 GMT-0400 (EDT)
      oplog last event time:   Wed Oct 03 2012 14:59:10 GMT-0400 (EDT)
      now:                     Wed Oct 03 2012 15:00:21 GMT-0400 (EDT)

   The output of :method:`db.printReplicationInfo()` is identical to
   that of :method:`rs.printReplicationInfo()`.

.. [#run-on-secondary]
   If run on a secondary, the method calls
   :method:`db.printSlaveReplicationInfo()`. See
   :method:`db.printSlaveReplicationInfo()` for details.
