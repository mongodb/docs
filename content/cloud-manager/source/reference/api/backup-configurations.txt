Overview
--------

A backup configuration determines the settings used to back up a sharded
cluster or replica set. The ``backupConfigs`` resource lets you view and
update backup configurations. In certain cases, you can also create 
backup configurations, as described in 
:doc:`/reference/api/backup/update-backup-config`. The 
``backupConfigs`` resource supports only the ``GET`` and ``PATCH``
methods.

To update or create a backup configuration, you must issue the request 
from an IP address on your user account's :ref:`access list
<access-list-for-api-operations>`. The ``backupConfigs`` resource accepts
``PATCH`` requests only from IP addresses in the access list.
