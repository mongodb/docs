Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the helper classes, or **builders**, that
the {+driver-short+} provides to create types used in your operations.
Using builders helps you identify errors at compile time and avoid them
at runtime. This guide provides information on builder classes that you
can use for the following tasks:

- Creating a filter definition
- Creating a projection
- Defining a sort order
- Defining an update operation
- Selecting index keys

.. tip:: {+analyzer+}

   The {+analyzer-short+} is a tool that helps you analyze your
   builders definitions and understand how your {+lang-framework+} code
   translates into the {+query-api+}. For more information and
   installation instructions, see the `{+analyzer-short+} reference page <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-analyzer/current/>`__.

You should read this guide if you want to learn more about how to
construct definitions and build up syntax using builders.

Sample Class
------------

The code examples in this guide demonstrate how you can use builders to
create types to interact with documents in the sample collection ``plants.flowers``.
Documents in this collection are modeled by the following ``Flower`` class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/builders.cs
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-model
   :end-before: end-model

Each builder class takes a generic type parameter
``TDocument`` which represents the type of document that you are working
with. In this guide, the ``Flower`` class is the document type used in
each builder class example.

Construct a Filter
------------------

The ``FilterDefinitionBuilder`` class provides a type-safe interface for
building up queries. Suppose you want to query your collection for
documents matching the following criteria:

- ``Price`` field value less than 20
- ``Category`` field value is "Perennial"

Use builders to create the filter definition with the typed variant:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Filter;
   var filter = builder.Lt(f => f.Price, 20) & builder.Eq(f => f.Category, "Perennial");
   
Using the typed variant form provides compile-time safety. Additionally,
your IDE can provide refactoring support.

Alternatively, you can use string-based field names to contruct the filter:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Filter;
   var filter = builder.Lt("Price", 20) & builder.Eq("Category", "Perennial");

If you are using LINQ, you can also use the ``Inject()`` method to apply the filter
to a LINQ query:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Filter;
   var filter = builder.Lt("Price", 20) & builder.Eq("Category", "Perennial");
   var query = collection.AsQueryable().Where(f => filter.Inject());

Array Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your document has properties or fields that serialize to arrays,
you can use the methods beginning with ``Any``, such as ``AnyEq()`` or
``AnyLt()``, to compare the entire array against a single item.

Use builders to check which documents in the collection have a
``Season`` array that includes "winter":

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Filter;
   var filter = builder.AnyEq(f => f.Season, "winter");

You can also call the ``ElemMatch()`` method to find documents that have an
array field that contains at least one element that matches a specified search
criteria. The following example returns documents that contain the value
``"Summer"`` in their ``Season`` array:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Filter;
   var filter = builder.ElemMatch(f => f.Season, s => s == "Summer");

To learn more about array operators, see the :manual:`Array Query Operators
</reference/operator/query-array/>` guide in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

.. _csharp-builders-projection:

Create a Projection
-------------------

The ``ProjectionDefinitionBuilder`` class provides a type-safe interface for
defining a projection. Suppose you want to create a projection on the
``Name`` and ``Price`` fields, but exclude the ``Id`` field.

Use builders to create the projection definition with the typed variant:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Projection;
   var projection = builder.Include(f => f.Name).Include(f => f.Price).Exclude(f => f.Id);

You can also use string-based field names to define the projection:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Projection;
   var projection = builder.Include("Name").Include("Price").Exclude("Id");

Finally, you can use the ``Expression()`` method to define the
projection:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Projection;
   var projection = builder.Expression(f => new { Name = f.Name, Price = f.Price });

This definition has a return type of ``ProjectionDefinition<TDocument,
TProjection>`` whereas the others return a
``ProjectionDefinition<TDocument>``.

Lambda Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver supports using lambda expressions to render projections. When
you define a ``Find()`` projection with the ``Expression()`` method to
create a lambda expression, the driver inspects the expression
to determine which fields are referenced and automatically constructs a
server-side projection to return only those fields.

You can also use lambda expressions to create new fields by performing
operations on values in your documents. The following example shows how
you can use a lambda expression to project a new ``Profit`` field
using the ``Price`` and ``Stock`` fields:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Projection;
   var projection = builder.Expression(f => new { Profit = f.Price * f.Stock });

.. note:: ``Id`` Field Exclusion

   When you create a projection using a lambda expression, the output
   automatically excludes the ``Id`` field unless you explicitly include
   is as a projection field.

Define a Sort
-------------

The ``SortDefinitionBuilder`` class provides a type-safe interface for
building up sort syntax. Suppose you want to define a sort with the
following order:

- Ascending on ``Price``
- Descending on ``Category``

Use builders to create the sort definition with the typed variant:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Sort;
   var sort = builder.Ascending(f => f.Price).Descending(f => f.Category);

Alternatively, you can use string-based field names to define the sort:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Sort;
   var sort = builder.Ascending("Price").Descending("Category");

Define an Update
----------------

The ``UpdateDefinitionBuilder`` class provides a type-safe interface for
building up an update specification. Suppose you want to create an
update specification with the following criteria:

- Create the new field ``SunRequirement``
- Multiply the ``Price`` field value by 0.9

Use builders to create the update specification with the typed variant:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Update;
   var update = builder.Set(f => f.SunRequirement, "Full sun").Mul(f => f.Price, 0.9);

Alternatively, you can use string-based field names to define the update:
   
.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.Update;
   var update = builder.Set("SunRequirement", "Full sun").Mul("Price", 0.9);

.. _csharp-builders-indexes:

Define Index Keys
-----------------

The ``IndexKeysDefinitionBuilder`` class provides a type-safe interface for
defining index keys. Suppose you want to select ``Category`` as an
ascending index key.

Use builders to select the index key with the typed variant:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<Flower>.IndexKeys;
   var keys = builder.Ascending(f => f.Category);

Alternatively, you can use string-based field names to select the index key:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   var builder = Builders<BsonDocument>.IndexKeys;
   var keys = builder.Ascending("Category");

The ``IndexKeysDefinitionBuilder`` class also provides methods to build
a wildcard index. You can create a wildcard index using ``All field paths`` or ``A
single field path``, in this case using ``Category``:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: ``All field paths``
      :tabid: all-wildcard-index

      .. code-block:: csharp
         :copyable: true

         var builder = Builders<Flower>.IndexKeys;
         var keys = builder.Wildcard();

   .. tab:: ``A single field path``
      :tabid: single-wildcard-index

      .. code-block:: csharp
         :copyable: true

         var builder = Builders<Flower>.IndexKeys;

         // Using the typed variant
         var keys = builder.Wildcard(f => f.Category);

         // Using string-based field names
         var keys = builder.Wildcard("Category");

For more information about how to use wildcard indexes, see 
:manual:`Wildcard Indexes </core/indexes/index-types/index-wildcard>`.

.. _csharp-builders-aggregation:

Build an Aggregation Pipeline
-----------------------------

The ``PipelineDefinitionBuilder`` class provides a type-safe interface for
defining an **aggregation pipeline**. An aggregation pipeline is a series of
stages that are used to transform a document. Suppose you want to create a
pipeline that performs the following operations:

- Matches all documents with "spring" in the ``Season`` field
- Sorts the results by the ``Category`` field
- Groups the documents by category and shows the average price and total
  available for all documents in that category

Use ``PipelineDefinitionBuilder`` classes to build the pipeline:

.. code-block:: csharp

   var sortBuilder = Builders<Flower>.Sort.Ascending(f => f.Category);
   var matchFilter = Builders<Flower>.Filter.AnyEq(f => f.Season, "spring");

   var pipeline = new EmptyPipelineDefinition<Flower>()
       .Match(matchFilter)
       .Sort(sortBuilder)
       .Group(f => f.Category,
              g => new
                 {
                    name = g.Key, 
                    avgPrice = g.Average(f => f.Price), 
                    totalAvailable = g.Sum(f => f.Stock)
                  }
             );   

The preceding example creates the following pipeline:

.. code-block:: json
   
   [{ "$match" : { "season" : "spring" } }, { "$sort" : { "category" : 1 } }, { "$group" : { "_id" : "$category", "avgPrice" : { "$avg" : "$price" }, "totalAvailable" : { "$sum" : "$stock" } } }]

You can add stages to your pipeline that don't have corresponding type-safe
methods in the ``PipelineDefinitionBuilder`` interface by providing your query
as a ``BsonDocument`` to the `AppendStage() method
<{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver/MongoDB.Driver.PipelineDefinitionBuilder.AppendStage.html>`__.

.. code-block:: csharp

   var pipeline = new EmptyPipelineDefinition<BsonDocument>().AppendStage<BsonDocument, BsonDocument, BsonDocument>("{ $set: { field1: '$field2' } }");

.. note:: 

   When using a ``BsonDocument`` to define your pipeline stage, the driver does
   not take into account any ``BsonClassMap``, serialization attributes or
   serialization conventions. The field names used in the ``BsonDocument`` must
   match those stored on the server.

   For more information on providing a query as a ``BsonDocument``, see our
   :ref:`FAQ page <csharp-faq-unsupported-expressions>`.

To learn more about the Aggregation Pipeline, see the
:manual:`Aggregation Pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline/>` server manual page.

.. _csharp-builders-out:

Write Pipeline Results to a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can write the documents returned from an aggregation pipeline to a
collection by creating an ``$out`` stage at the end of your aggregation
pipeline. To create an ``$out`` stage, call the ``Out()`` method on a
``PipelineStageDefinitionBuilder``. The ``Out()`` method requires the name of
the collection you want to write the documents to.

The following example builds an aggregation pipeline that matches all documents
with a ``season`` field value of ``"Spring"`` and outputs them to
a ``springFlowers`` collection:

.. code-block:: csharp

   var outputCollection = database.GetCollection("springFlowers");
   var matchFilter = Builders<Flower>.Filter.AnyEq(f => f.Season, "spring");

   // Creates an aggregation pipeline and outputs resulting documents to a new collection.
   var pipeline = new EmptyPipelineDefinition<Flower>()
       .Match(matchFilter)
       .Out(outputCollection);

You can write the results of an aggregation pipeline to a time series collection
by specifying a ``TimeSeriesOption`` object and passing it as the second
parameter to the ``Out()`` method.

Imagine that the documents in the ``plants.flowers`` collection contain a ``datePlanted`` field that
holds BSON date values. You can store the documents in this collection in a time
series collection by using the ``datePlanted`` field as the time field.

The following example creates a ``TimeSeriesOptions`` object and specifies
``datePlanted`` as the ``timeField``. It then builds an aggregation pipeline that matches all documents
with a ``season`` field value of ``"Spring"`` and outputs them to a
time series collection called ``springFlowerTimes``.

.. code-block:: csharp

   var timeSeriesOptions = new TimeSeriesOptions("datePlanted");
   var collectionName = "springFlowerTimes"
   var matchFilter = Builders<Flower>.Filter.AnyEq(f => f.Season, "spring");

   // Creates an aggregation pipeline and outputs resulting documents to a time series collection.
   var pipeline = new EmptyPipelineDefinition<Flower>()
       .Match(matchFilter)
       .Out(collectionName, timeSeriesOptions);

To learn more about time series collections, see :ref:`csharp-time-series`.

Build an Atlas Search Query
---------------------------

The ``Search`` class provides a type-safe interface for creating a
:manual:`$search </reference/operator/aggregation/search/>` 
pipeline stage. 

To learn how to construct search queries with the ``Search`` class, see
:ref:`csharp-atlas-search`.

Perform an Atlas Vector Search
------------------------------

You can use builders to create a ``$vectorSearch`` aggregation pipeline stage to perform an
approximate nearest neighbor search on a vector in the specified field. Your collection *must*
have a defined Atlas Vector Search index before you can perform a vector search on your data.

.. tip::

   To obtain the sample dataset used in the following example, see :ref:`csharp-quickstart`.
   To create the sample Atlas Vector Search index used in the following example, see
   :atlas:`Create an Atlas Vector Search Index </atlas-vector-search/create-index>` in the
   Atlas manual.

Consider the ``embedded_movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database. You
can use a ``$vectorSearch`` stage to perform a semantic search on the ``plot_embedding``
field of the documents in the collection.

The following example shows how to use builders to generate an aggregation pipeline to
perform the following operations:

- Performs a vector search on the Atlas Vector Search index of the ``plot_embedding`` field using vector embeddings for the string ``"time travel"``
- Fetches the ``Title`` and ``Plot`` fields from documents found in the vector search

.. code-block:: csharp
