How do I get support for my Atlas clusters?
-------------------------------------------

Using the in-app chat or opening a support case, :doc:`request support

performance of the database requires an upgraded support plan.

For more information on support plans or to subscribe to an 
upgraded support plan, you can either:

- Contact |mdb-support|, or

- Navigate to your organization's :guilabel:`Support` tab in the 
  |service| console.
