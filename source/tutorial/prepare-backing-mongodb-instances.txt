Overview
--------

Before you install |onprem| you must install the
:ref:`mms-application-database`, which holds |onprem| operational data.
If you will use the |onprem| Backup feature, you must also install the
Backup Database, which stores oplog data, temporary sync data, and,
depending on your configuration, stores your snapshots.

Both databases run on dedicated MongoDB :term:`replica sets <replica
set>`. If you use multiple Backup Databases, set up separate replica
sets for each database. The replica set for each database is dedicated
to that database only and **must store no other data**.

The application database and the backup database(s) run as separate
replica sets to ensure that the |application| would keep running should
you accidentally fill the Backup Database's volume. If that occurred
and both databases were members of the same replica set, |onprem| would
become inoperable.

.. note::

   You cannot use |onprem| to deploy the backing database. You must
   deploy and manage the backing databases manually.

Replica Set Topology
--------------------

Each replica set usually comprises three data-bearing members to
provide high availability. If you cannot allocate space for three
data-bearing members, the third member can be an arbiter, but keep in
mind that |onprem| uses ``w:2`` :manual:`write concern
</reference/write-concern>`, which reports a write operation as
successful after acknowledgement from the primary and one secondary. If
you use a replica set with only two data-bearing members, and if you
lose one of the data-bearing members, MongoDB blocks write operations.

For the |onprem| Application Database, you can optionally run one member
of the replica set on the same physical server as |onprem|. For *testing
only*, you may use a standalone MongoDB deployment in place of each
replica set.

Replica Sets Requirements
-------------------------

The replica sets that host the |application| Database and Backup
Database(s) must:

- **Dedicated Databases:** The replica sets must store data **only** in
  support of |onprem| operations. They must store **no other data**.

- **MongoDB Version:** The replica sets must run MongoDB 2.6.6 or
  later. If they run a 3.0+ version of MongoDB, the replica sets must
  run MongoDB version 3.0.6 or later.

- **Storage Engine**: Use the storage engine appropriate to your
  workload. In most cases, this is MMAPv1. See the :ref:`storage engine
  considerations <storage-engine-considerations-for-backing-dbs>` below.

- **Settings:**

  - Set the MongoDB :setting:`security.javascriptEnabled` option to
    ``true``, which is the default. The |application| uses the
    :query:`$where` query and requires this setting be enabled on the
    |application| Database.

  - **Do not** run the MongoDB ``notablescan`` option.

- **Credentials:** The replica sets must include user credentials for
  accessing the backing database. When you install |onprem|, you will
  include the user credentials in the :setting:`mongo.mongoUri`
  setting. You will also specify the :parameter:`authentication
  mechanism <authenticationMechanisms>` if the database uses a
  mechanism other than default MongoDB authentication.

Server Prerequisites
--------------------

The servers that run the replica sets must meet the following requirements.

- The hardware requirements described in
  :ref:`mms-application-database-specifications` or
  :ref:`backup-database-specifications`, depending on which database
  the server will host. If a server hosts other |onprem| components in
  addition to the database, you must sum the hardware requirements for
  each component to determine the requirements for the server.

- The system requirements in the :manual:`MongoDB Production Notes
  </administration/production-notes>`. The Production Notes include
  information on ulimits, NUMA, and other configuration options.

- The MongoDB ports requirements described in
  :doc:`/reference/firewall-configuration`. Each server's firewall
  rules must allow access to the required ports.

- **RHEL servers only**:

  For more information, see :manual:`UNIX ulimit Settings
  </reference/ulimit>` in the MongoDB manual.

.. _storage-engine-considerations-for-backing-dbs:

Choosing a Storage Engine for Application and Backup Databases
--------------------------------------------------------------

MongoDB provides both the MMAPv1 and WiredTiger storage engines. The
|application| and Backup Database schemas have been designed to achieve
maximum performance on MMAPv1. Therefore, while WiredTiger outperforms
MMAPv1 on typical workloads, MMAPv1 performs best given the unique |onprem|
workload.

The MMAPv1 engine also minimizes storage in the Backup Database's
blockstore, as all the blocks are already compressed and padding is
disabled. There is typically no further storage benefit to be gained by
taking advantage of WiredTiger compression.

In one case, WiredTiger might be preferable. Backups of insert-only
MongoDB workloads that benefit from high levels of block-level
de-duplication in the blockstore may see a compression-based storage
reduction when running the Backup Database on the WiredTiger storage
engine.

The storage engine used by the Backup Database is independent from the
storage engine chosen to store a deployment's snapshots. If the Backup
Database uses the MMAPv1 storage engine, it can store backup snapshots
for WiredTiger backup jobs in its blockstore.
