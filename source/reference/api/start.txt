Description
-----------

Starts the synchronization between a source and destination cluster.

Requirements
------------

State
~~~~~

To use the ``start`` endpoint, ``mongosync`` must be in the ``IDLE``
state.

Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~

The user specified in the ``mongosync`` connection string must have the
required permissions on the source and destination clusters. Refer to
:ref:`c2c-permissions-and-roles` to ensure that the user has the correct
permissions to start the synchronization.

Multiple ``mongosync`` Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure that you use the configured ``mongosync`` user in the connection 
strings for the :setting:`cluster0` or :setting:`cluster1` settings when
you start ``mongosync``.

Request Body Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 20 13 13 54

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Necessity
     - Description

   * - ``source``
     - string
     - Required
     - Name of the source cluster.
    
   * - ``destination``
     - string
     - Required
     - Name of the destination cluster.

   * - ``buildIndexes``
     - string
     - Optional
     - Configures index builds during sync.

       Supported Options:

       - ``beforeDataCopy`` (the default) causes ``mongosync`` to build indexes
         on the destination cluster. These include both existing indexes and
         any indexes created during migration on the source cluster.

       - ``never`` causes ``mongosync`` to skip building unnecessary indexes
         during sync. This can improve migration performance, especially with
         index heavy workloads.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-verifier-buildIndexes

         :red:`WARNING:` Do **not** manually build indexes while ``mongosync`` is 
         performing a migration.  Wait until the migration is fully 
         committed.

         For more information on the indexes it does build, see 
         :ref:`c2c-required-indexes`.

       ``/start`` returns an error when ``buildIndexes`` is set to ``never``
       and ``reversible`` is set to ``true``.

       If you call ``/start`` without specifying the ``buildIndexes`` option,
       ``mongosync`` builds indexes on the destination cluster.

       .. versionadded:: 1.3.0

   * - ``enableUserWriteBlocking``
     - boolean
     - Optional
     - If set to ``true``, blocks writes on the destination cluster
       while the synchronization is in progress. After the
       synchronization is committed to the destination cluster, the
       original source cluster blocks writes and the destination cluster
       accepts writes.

       :gold:`IMPORTANT:` If you are migrating from a pre-6.0 source cluster, 
       you cannot set ``enableUserWriteBlocking`` to ``true``.

       To reverse sync, the ``enableUserWriteBlocking`` field must be set
       to ``true``. To allow the source cluster to accept writes again,
       for example after running migration tests, run the following
       command: 

       .. code-block:: shell 
          
          db.adminCommand( { setUserWriteBlockMode: 1, global: false } )

       Default value is ``false``.

   * - ``includeNamespaces``
     - array
     - Optional
     - Filters the databases or collections to include in sync. 

       .. include:: /includes/api/facts/namespace-explanation.rst

       .. versionadded:: 1.1

   * - ``excludeNamespaces``
     - array
     - Optional
     - Filters the databases or collections to exclude from sync.

       .. include:: /includes/api/facts/namespace-explanation.rst

       .. versionadded:: 1.6

   * - ``reversible``
     - boolean
     - Optional
     - If set to ``true``, enables the sync operation to be
       reversed.

       To reverse sync, the ``enableUserWriteBlocking`` field must be set
       to ``true``.

       This option is not supported for the following configurations:

       * Sync from a replica set to a sharded cluster

       * Sync sharded clusters that have different numbers of shards

       * Reversible sync when ``buildIndexes`` is set to ``never``.

       * Reversible sync with the embedded verifier. The
         verifier supports the initial forward direction of
         reversible sync. When you call the ``/reverse``
         endpoint it disables the verifier.

       :gold:`IMPORTANT:` If you are migrating from a pre-6.0 source cluster, 
       you cannot set ``reversible`` to ``true``.

       For more information, see the :ref:`reverse <c2c-api-reverse>` endpoint.
       
       Default value is ``false``.

   * - ``sharding``
     - document
     - Optional
     - Configures sync between a replica set and sharded cluster.
       Sync from a replica set to a sharded cluster requires this
       option.

       For more information, see :ref:`c2c-api-start-sharding`. 

       .. versionadded:: 1.1

   * - ``verification``
     - Document 
     - Optional
     - Configures the embedded verifier.

       For more information, see :ref:`c2c-start-verifier`.

       .. versionadded:: 1.9

   * - ``verification.enabled``
     - Bool
     - Optional
     - Enables the embedded verifier. The verifier performs a
       series of verification checks on supported collections on
       the destination cluster to confirm that the migration was
       successful.

       If the verifier finds no errors, ``mongosync``
       transitions to the ``COMMITTED`` state. If it does
       encounter errors, it fails the migration.

       The verifier is enabled by default.

       :red:`WARNING`: The verifier does not check all
       collections or data. For details, see
       :ref:`c2c-verify-embedded-limitations`.

       .. versionadded:: 1.9


.. _c2c-api-start-sharding:

Sharding Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.1

To sync from a replica set to a sharded cluster, set the 
``sharding`` option to shard collections on the destination cluster.

The ``sharding`` option has the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 15 15 70

   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``createSupportingIndexes``
     - boolean
     - Optional. Sets whether sync creates a supporting index
       for the shard key, if none exists. The default is ``false``.

       For more information and limitations, see 
       :ref:`c2c-supporting-index-behavior`.

   * - ``shardingEntries``
     - array of documents
     - Required. Sets the namespace and key of collections to shard
       during sync.

       Collections not included in this array sync to unsharded 
       collections on the destination cluster. If set with an empty
       array, no collections are sharded.

   * - | ``shardingEntries``
       | ``.collection``
     - string
     - Sets the collection to shard. 

   * - | ``shardingEntries``
       | ``.database``
     - string
     - Sets the database of the collection to shard.
 
   * - | ``shardingEntries``
       | ``.shardCollection``
     - document 
     - Sets the shard key to generate on the destination cluster.

   * - | ``shardingEntries``
       | ``.shardCollection``
       | ``.key``
     - array 
     - Sets the fields to use for the shard key.

       For more information, see :ref:`shard-key`.

``mongosync`` throws an error if the ``sharding`` option is not set when
syncing from a replica set to a sharded cluster. ``mongosync`` also
throws an error if the ``sharding`` option is set with any other
configuration.

.. _c2c-disabled-verifier:

Start with the Verifier Disabled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.9, the embedded verifier runs by default when you
start a migration. If you need to disable it, set
``verification.enabled`` to ``false``.

Request:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/start-no-verifier.sh

Response:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/responses/success.json
   :language: json
   :copyable: false

You should verify that a migration was successful before
transferring your application load to the destination cluster.
If you need to disable the verifier for any reason, use an
alternative :ref:`method <c2c-verification>` to verify sync.

Behavior
--------

.. _c2c-start-verifier:

Embedded Verifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 1.9, ``mongosync`` provides an embedded verifier to
determine whether data transfer from the source cluster to the
destination was successful.

When enabled, the verifier performs a series of verification
checks on the destination cluster. If any of these checks return
an error, the verifier fails the migration. If all checks
succeed, ``mongosync`` transitions to the ``COMMITTED`` state.

To disable the verifier, see :ref:`c2c-disabled-verifier`.

The ``/start`` endpoint returns an error if you enable
verification checks that are not supported by the source or
destination cluster or if there is insufficient memory. 

State
~~~~~

If the ``start`` request is successful, ``mongosync`` enters the
``RUNNING`` state.

.. _c2c-shard-replica-sets:

Shard Replica Sets 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sync from a replica set to a sharded cluster requires the 
``sharding`` option. This option configures how ``mongosync`` shards
collections.

The ``sharding.shardingEntries`` array specifies the collections to shard.
Collections that are not listed in this array replicate as unsharded.

For more information, see :ref:`Sharded Cluster Behavior
<c2c-sharded-cluster-behavior>`. 

.. _c2c-supporting-index-behavior:

Supporting Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mongosync`` syncs indexes from the source cluster to the destination
cluster. When syncing from a replica set to a sharded cluster,
``mongosync`` may require an additional index to support the shard key,
which may not exist on the source cluster.

``mongosync`` can create supporting indexes for sharded collections during sync.
This is done by setting the ``sharding.createSupportingIndexes`` option.

When ``sharding.createSupportingIndexes`` is ``false`` (the default): 

* Each shard key you provide for the ``sharding.shardingEntries`` option
  must have an existing index on the source cluster.

* One of the indexes used for the shard key must have simple collation if the 
  collection uses any other collation.

* To use a unique index in the shard key, you must specify its uniqueness when
  you create the index on the source cluster. 

* Unique indexes on the source cluster that are incompatible with the requested
  shard key on the destination cluster, such as a unique index on the source
  that does not contain the requested shard key as a prefix on the destination,
  can cause ``mongosync`` to fail.

When ``sharding.createSupportingIndexes`` is ``true``: 

* If the supporting indexes exist on the source cluster, ``mongosync`` 
  syncs the indexes to the destination cluster and uses them 
  as shard keys. 

* If the supporting indexes don't exist, ``mongosync`` creates them on the
  destination cluster.

The ``sharding.createSupportingIndexes`` option affects all sharded
collections.

.. _rename-during-sync:

Rename During Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collections listed in the ``sharding.shardingEntries`` array 
when synced from a replica set to a sharded cluster 
become sharded collections on the destination cluster.

Renaming a collection (such as with the :dbcommand:`renameCollection` command)
on the source cluster after calling ``start`` but before ``mongosync`` begins 
to copy the collection can block the collection from sharding on the destination.

.. note:: 

   Renaming collections to use a different database while syncing from a
   replica set to a sharded cluster is not supported.
    

To check whether it is safe to rename collections, call the 
:ref:`c2c-api-progress` endpoint and check the value of the 
``collectionCopy.estimatedCopiedBytes`` field in the return document. 

* A value of 0 indicates that ``mongosync`` has not started to copy the
  collection.

  Renaming a collection at this point may result in an unsharded collection 
  on the destination cluster, as the transition to copying can happen before
  the rename takes effect on the source.

* A value greater than 0 indicates that ``mongosync`` has started the copy.
  Renaming the collection from this point on does not block
  its sharding on the destination cluster, even in the event  of a crash.

.. _c2c-required-indexes:

Required Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you call ``/start`` with the ``buildIndexes`` option set to ``never``,
``mongosync`` skips building unnecessary indexes.

Indexes that are always built include:

* ``mongosync`` builds an index on the ``_id`` field of every
  collection it copies.

* ``mongosync`` builds dummy indexes for each sharded collection that 
  does not have an index to support the shard key on the destination 
  cluster. When ``buildIndexes`` is set to ``never``, ``mongosync`` 
  retains this index after commit.
