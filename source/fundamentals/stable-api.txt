.. note::

   The {+stable-api+} feature requires MongoDB Server 5.0 or later.

   You should only use the {+stable-api+} feature if all the MongoDB
   servers you are connecting to support this feature.

Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to specify the **{+stable-api+}** when connecting to
a MongoDB instance or replica set. You can use the {+stable-api+} feature to
force the server to run operations with behavior compatible with the
specified **API version**. An API version defines the expected behavior of the
operations it covers and the format of server responses. If you change to
a different API version, the operations are not guaranteed to be
compatible and the server responses are not guaranteed to be similar.

When you use the {+stable-api+} feature with an official MongoDB driver, you
can update your driver or server without worrying about backward compatibility
issues of the commands covered by the {+stable-api+}.

See the MongoDB reference page on the :manual:`{+stable-api+} </reference/stable-api/>`
for more information including a list of commands it covers.

The following sections describe how you can enable the {+stable-api+} for
your MongoDB client and the options that you can specify.

Enable the {+stable-api+} on a MongoDB Client
---------------------------------------------

To enable the {+stable-api+}, you must specify an API version in the settings
of your MongoDB client. Once you instantiate a ``MongoClient`` instance with
a specified API version, all commands you run with that client use that
version of the {+stable-api+}.

.. tip::

   If you need to run commands using more than one version of the 
   {+stable-api+}, instantiate a separate client with that version.

   If you need to run commands not covered by the {+stable-api+}, make sure the
   "strict" option is disabled. See the section on
   :ref:`{+stable-api+} Options <stable-api-options>` for more information.

The following example shows how you can instantiate a ``MongoClient`` that
sets the {+stable-api+} version and connects to a server by performing the
following operations:

- Construct a ``ServerApi`` instance using the ``ServerApi.Builder``
  helper class.
- Specify a {+stable-api+} version using a constant from the
  ``ServerApiVersion`` class.
- Construct a ``MongoClientSettings`` instance using the
  ``MongoClientSettings.Builder`` class.
- Specify a server to connect to using a ``ServerAddress`` instance.
- Instantiate a ``MongoClient`` using the ``MongoClient.create()`` method
  and pass your ``MongoClientSettings`` instance as a parameter.

.. warning::

   If you specify an API version and connect to a MongoDB server that does
   not support the {+stable-api+}, your application may raise an exception when
   executing a command on your MongoDB server. If you use a ``MongoClient``
   that specifies the API version to query a server that does not support it,
   your query could fail with an exception message that includes the
   following text:

   .. code-block:: none
      :copyable: false

      'Unrecognized field 'apiVersion' on server...

{+stable-api+} Options
--------------------------

You can enable or disable optional behavior related to the {+stable-api+} as
described in the following table.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 25,75

   * - Option Name
     - Description

   * - Strict
     - | **Optional**. When set, if you call a command that is not part of the declared API version, the driver raises an exception.
       |
       | Default: **false**

   * -  DeprecationErrors
     - | **Optional**. When set, if you call a command that is deprecated in the declared API version, the driver raises an exception.
       |
       | Default: **false**

The following example shows how you can set the two options on an instance
of ``ServerApi`` by chaining methods on the ``ServerApi.Builder``:
