Replication
===========

Database replication ensures redundancy, backup, and automatic failover.
Replication occurs through groups of servers known as replica sets.

This page lists the documents, tutorials, and reference pages that
describe replica sets.

For an overview, see :doc:`/core/replication`. To work with members, see
:doc:`administration/replica-sets`. To configure deployment
architecture, see :doc:`administration/replication-architectures`. To
modify read and write operations, see :doc:`applications/replication`.
For procedures for performing certain replication tasks, see the :ref:`Tutorials
<replica-set-tutorials-list>` list.
