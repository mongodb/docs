Delete a Snapshot
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

To delete snapshots for replica sets and sharded clusters, use the |mms| console
to find then select a backup snapshot to delete.

.. important::

   Do not delete a snapshot if you might need it for a point-in-time
   restore. Point-in-time restores apply oplog entries to the last
   snapshot taken before the specified point.
