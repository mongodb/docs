Read Concern ``"local"``

   :description: read concern, local read concern, read isolation, transactions, multi-document transactions
   :keywords: read concern, local read concern, read isolation, transactions, multi-document transactions


A query with read concern ``"local"`` returns the instance's most
recent data. Read concern ``"local"`` provides no guarantee that the
data has been written to a majority of the replica set members (i.e.
may be rolled back).

Read concern ``"local"`` is the default for:

- read operations against primary

- read operations against secondaries if the reads are associated with
  :ref:`causally consistent sessions <sessions>`.

Causally Consistent Sessions
----------------------------

Read concern :readconcern:`local` is available for use with causally
consistent sessions.

Read Concern ``"local"`` and Transactions
--------------------------------------------

In a multi-document transaction, read concern levels
:readconcern:`"local"` and :readconcern:`"snapshot"` are available for
:ref:`read and write operations that support read concern in a
transaction <read-concern-operations>`.

.. note::

   For the operations in a transaction, you set the read concern at the
   transaction level, not at the individual operation level.

.. seealso:: :readconcern:`"snapshot"`

Write Operations and Read Concern ``"local"``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a multi-document transaction, both the read operations and the write
operations can accept the read concern level :readconcern:`"local"`.
The following write operations can accept a read concern level as part
of a transaction:

- :dbcommand:`delete`

- :dbcommand:`findAndModify`

- :dbcommand:`insert`

- :dbcommand:`update`

For a list of all operations that accept read concerns, see
:ref:`read-concern-operations`.

Example
-------

.. include:: /includes/fact-read-concern-write-timeline.rst

Then, the following tables summarizes the state of the data that a read
operation with :readconcern:`"local"` read concern would see at
time ``T``.
