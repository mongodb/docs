      If you'd like to install MongoDB Enterprise packages from a
      particular :ref:`release series <release-version-numbers>`, such as
      2.4 or 2.6, you can specify the release series in the repository
      configuration. For example, to restrict your system to the 2.6
      release series, add the following repository:
    language: sh
    code: |
      echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.com/apt/ubuntu "$(lsb_release -sc)"/mongodb-enterprise/2.6 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-enterprise-2.6.list

      Although you can specify any available version of MongoDB,
      ``apt-get`` will upgrade the packages when a newer version
      becomes available. To prevent unintended upgrades, pin the
      package. To pin the version of MongoDB at the currently
      installed version, issue the following command sequence:
    language: sh
    code: |
      echo "mongodb-enterprise hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
      echo "mongodb-enterprise-server hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
      echo "mongodb-enterprise-shell hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
      echo "mongodb-enterprise-mongos hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
      echo "mongodb-enterprise-tools hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
post: |
  Versions of the MongoDB packages before 2.6 use a different repository
  location. Refer to the version of the documentation appropriate for
  your MongoDB version.
