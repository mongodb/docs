   to every situation.

Without Giza (Recommended)
--------------------------

Adding an SVG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever possible, you should publish diagrams in SVG form. This
provides a crisp image at any screen resolution with a small file
size.

First install `mut <https://github.com/mongodb/mut>`__,
`Inkscape <http://inkscape.org/>`__, and
`svgo <https://github.com/svg/svgo>`__.

Place your SVG in ``source/images/``. If you named your SVG
``foo.svg``, then run the following from within that directory:

.. code-block:: sh

   mut-images foo.svg

This will generate ``foo.bakedsvg.svg``. This *baked* SVG file
contains no text: to prevent users from needing to download any fonts,
``mut-images`` transforms all text elements into paths. It then uses
``svgo`` to minify the resulting SVG file.

Create a ``source/images/foo.rst`` file with contents such as the
following:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. figure:: /images/foo.bakedsvg.svg
      :alt: An example image.
      :figwidth: 500px

Check in and commit all three files.

Adding a PNG
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not all images start their life as an SVG. The process is less refined
for adding these files, but in general keep the resolution under two times
the display width.

For example, if you want to display an image as 500px wide, the image
itself should not be wider than 1000px.

.. note::

   The MongoDB Documentation Project does not currently have a best
   practice for handling very large (>1080p) files or photographic
   content.

   It may make sense to use
   `mozjpeg <https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg>`__ if you need lossy
   compression; `imagemagick <http://imagemagick.org/>`__ to resize images;
   and a `Ninja <http://ninja-build.org/>`__ file to put the pieces
   together.

The default ``libpng`` encoder does not create optimal PNG files, so
install `zopflipng <https://github.com/google/zopfli>`__. To compress a
PNG, use the following template:

.. code-block:: sh

   zopflipng -m <input.png> <output.png>

This may take several minutes, as the ``-m`` option requests a
brute-force search for optimal compression parameters.

Place the output PNG in ``source/images/``, and create a
``source/images/foo.rst`` file with contents such as the following:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. figure:: /images/foo.png
      :alt: An example image.
      :figwidth: 500px

With Giza
---------

Some MongoDB documentation projects use Giza's image generation. This
can be effective when you need images rendered at different sizes
for different output formats.

It has the following disadvantages:

* Giza only accepts SVGs: you must embed raster files inside of an SVG,
* Giza invokes inkscape for each input file, and
* Reliability problems. There was one instance where giza generated
  some images sans any text.

Giza looks for the path listed in ``system.files.data.files`` within
``config/build_conf.yaml`` for a manifest containing image metadata.

The image metadata is a YAML list of documents such as the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: opsmanager-large
   alt: "A highly available deployment uses horizontal scaling of the application database and backup    blockstore database, as well as multiple backup daemons."
   output:
     - type: print
       tag: 'print'
       dpi: 300
       width: 2100
     - type: web
       dpi: 72
       width: 700

From this example, Giza will generate the following files in the build
directory:

* ``/source/images/opsmanager-large.rst``
* ``/source/images/opsmanager-large.png``
* ``/source/images/opsmanager-large-print.png``
