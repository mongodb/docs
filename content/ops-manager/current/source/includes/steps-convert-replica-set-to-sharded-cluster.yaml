  Configure the following settings in the 
  :guilabel:`Provide details for your new sharded cluster`
  modal:

  a. Name your :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>` components:

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 80
        :header-rows: 1
    
        * - Field
          - Action
    
        * - :guilabel:`Cluster Name`
          - Type the name of your new cluster. 
    
        * - :guilabel:`CSRS Name` (MongoDB 3.2 or later)
          - Type the name of the 
            :abbr:`CSRS (Config Server Replica Set)`.    

     .. note::

        You cannot change these values after you click
        :guilabel:`Convert`.

  b. Set the following values for each :binary:`~bin.mongod` process
     in your :guilabel:`Config Servers`. All fields are required.

     .. note::

        You must deploy at least one configuration server.

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 80
        :header-rows: 1
    
        * - Field
          - Action
    
        * - :guilabel:`Host Name`
          - From the menu, select an existing hostname or type a
            hostname in the search box above the list to find a host.

            If you need to add a new host:

            1. Click the :guilabel:`New Server` link.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Next`.
            #. Follow the instructions to install a new
               {+aagent+} on that new host.
            #. Click :guilabel:`Verify Agent`.


        * - :guilabel:`Port`
          - Type the |iana| port number.

        * - :guilabel:`Data Directory`
          - Type the absolute directory path to the database files for
            each :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

            The example path is ``/data``. 

            The :binary:`~bin.mongod`
            must have exclusive use of these paths on the specified
            host. The |mms| {+aagent+} must have file system
            permission to read, write, and execute all files and
            folders in this directory.
    
        * - :guilabel:`Log File`
          - Type the absolute file path for the log file for each
            :binary:`~bin.mongod`. 
 
            The example path is ``/data/mongodb.log``.

            The :binary:`~bin.mongod` must have exclusive use of these
            paths on the specified host. The |mms| {+aagent+}
            must have file system permission to read, write, and
            execute all files and folders in this directory.

     .. note:: Adding or Removing Config Servers

        - To add a new configuration server, click 
          :guilabel:`Add a Config Server`.
        - To remove a config server, click :icon:`trash-alt` to the right
          of the config server you want to remove.

  c. Set the following values for each :guilabel:`MongoS` process in
     your :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`. All fields are required.

     .. note::
     
        You must deploy at least one :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 80
        :header-rows: 1
    
        * - Field

        * - :guilabel:`Log File`
          - Type the abolute file path for the log of each
            :binary:`~bin.mongos` process.
 
            The example path is ``/data/mongodb.log``.

            The :binary:`~bin.mongos` must have exclusive use of these
            paths on the specified host. The |mms| {+aagent+}
            must have file system permission to read, write, and
            execute all files and folders in this directory.
    
     .. note:: Adding or Removing Mongo Shard Routers

        - To add a new :binary:`~bin.mongos`, click 
          :guilabel:`Add a MongoS`.
        - To remove a :binary:`~bin.mongos`, click :icon:`trash-alt`
          to the right of the ``mongos`` you want to remove.

  From the |mms| UI, click the :icon:`ellipsis-h` icon, then
  click :guilabel:`Connect to this instance`. The 
  :guilabel:`Connect to your Deployment` dialog provides the hostname
  and port of a :binary:`~bin.mongos` in the cluster.

  .. note::

     To convert a replica set to a sharded cluster with embedded config servers,
     you must first convert to a sharded cluster with dedicated config servers,
     then modify the cluster to use dedicated config servers.
