.. note:: Required Permissions

   To perform any of the following actions, you must have the
   :authrole:`Organization Owner` role.

You can grant |service| users access to |service| organizations. Assign
:ref:`user roles <user-roles>` to enforce permission levels for
|service| users.
   
It is recommended that you create a minimum of two users with the
:authrole:`Organization Owner` role to ensure that access to an 
organization does not depend on a single user.
