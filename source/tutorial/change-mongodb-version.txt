=============================
Change the Version of MongoDB
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

As MongoDB releases new versions, you can upgrade your deployments. You
can change the version for an entire :term:`sharded cluster` or
:term:`replica set`, or for a single :term:`standalone MongoDB instance
<standalone>` . Optionally, you also can downgrade a deployment to a
previous version.

Considerations
--------------

Before changing a deployment's MongoDB version:

- Consult the following documents for any special considerations or
  compatibility issues:

  - :manual:`The MongoDB Release Notes </release-notes>`

  - The documentation for your driver.

- Plan the version change during a predefined maintenance window.

- Before changing version on a production environment, change versions on
  a *staging* environment that reproduces your production environment to
  ensure your configuration is compatible with all changes.
