.. important:: Cannot Persist Geospatial Data Types

   Currently, you can only persist geospatial data. Geospatial data types *cannot* be persisted directly. For example, you 
   can't declare a property that is of type ``GeoBox``. 
   
   These types can only be used as arguments for geospatial queries.
