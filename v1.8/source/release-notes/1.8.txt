This page describes changes and new features introduced in

Patch Releases
--------------

.. _1.8.1-c2c-release-notes:

1.8.1 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**October 10, 2024**

New Features:

- Support added for OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication with
  the workload (machine) flow. For more information, see
  :ref:`c2c-rn-atlas-workload-identity`.

Issues Fixed:

- Fixed bug introduced in ``mongosync`` 1.8.0 to accommodate a
  server issue where replica sets that fail to set the
  :rsconf:`~settings.replicaSetId` configuration can cause
  ``mongosync`` to crash.

.. _1.8.0-c2c-release-notes:

1.8.0 Release
-------------

**August 6, 2024**


Updates to ``mongosync`` ``/progress`` API endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Returns a top-level boolean ``success`` field.

- Returns a new ``totalEventsApplied`` field.

- Reports per-partition progress tracking

See the :ref:`c2c-api-progress` documentation for more details.

Other Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Optimizations:

- Fixes and enhancements to significantly reduce the time needed to create 
  partitions and adds logging that tracks the partition creation process.

Other Changes:

- ``mongosync`` now performs a round robin assignment of the primary 
  shard for each database if the destination is a sharded cluster.

- ``mongosync`` now errors if it cannot create an index after 10 
  attempts. Previously, the system would attempt to create an index 
  indefinitely.

- ``mongosync`` now sends hostnames as telemetry.

- Improved performance of the initialization process by eliminating 
  the creation of unnecessary dummy indexes. ``mongosync`` now creates 
  dummy indexes for sharded collections only if the destination 
  cluster does not have an index to support the shard key.

Issues Fixed:

- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.0.0 that caused ``mongosync`` to fall 
  off the source cluster's oplog if no writes occurred on the source 
  cluster for an extended period of time.

- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.0.0 that caused ``mongosync`` to write 
  certain logs to a location outside of the specified log directory.

- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.0.0 that caused the ``mongosync`` 
  ``/progress`` endpoint to potentially return incorrect 
  ``totalBytes`` for sharded clusters.
