replacement:
  mechanism: "the authentication mechanism"
pre: |

  If you enable more than one authentication mechanism, you must specify which
  one of the authentication mechanisms the |mms| agents should use to connect
  to your deployment.

  a. Select {{mechanism}} from the :guilabel:`Agent Auth Mechanism` dropdown menu.
content: |

  b. |mms| automatically generates the Agents' usernames and passwords.
  
     |mms| creates users for the agents with the required user roles in the
     admin database for each existing deployment in |mms|. When you add a new
     deployment, |mms| creates the required users in the new deployment. 

  c. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

post: |
  You do not need to configure all of the agents, only the ones you installed.

  .. example::
     If you did not install the Backup agent, you do not need to configure the Backup
     agent.
