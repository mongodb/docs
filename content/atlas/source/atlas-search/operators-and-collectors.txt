Operators
---------

The following table describes the operators that can be used inside of the :pipeline:`$search` and :pipeline:`$searchMeta` aggregation pipeline stages 
to customize the output of your |fts| query. Each operator supports queries over particular |fts| :ref:`field types <bson-data-types>`. 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 50 30

   * - Operator
     - Description
     - Supported |fts| Types

   * - :ref:`autocomplete <autocomplete-ref>`
     - Performs a search-as-you-type query from an incomplete input string.
     - :ref:`autocomplete <bson-data-types-autocomplete>`

   * - :ref:`compound <compound-ref>`
     - Combines other operators into a single query.
     - Field types supported by the operators used inside the
       ``compound`` operator.

   * - :ref:`embeddedDocument <embedded-document-ref>`
     - Queries fields in embedded documents, which are documents that 
       are elements of an array.
     - :ref:`embeddedDocuments <bson-data-types-embedded-documents>` and 
       field types supported by the operators used inside the
       ``embeddedDocument`` operator. 

   * - :ref:`equals <equals-ref>`
     - Checks whether the field contains the specified value, including
       null value.

   * - :ref:`exists <exists-ref>`
     - Tests for the presence of a specified field, regardless of the
       field type.
     - Field type isn't used by the ``exists`` operator.

   * - :ref:`geoShape <geoshape-ref>`
     - Queries for values with specified geo shapes.
     - :ref:`geo <bson-data-types-geo>`

   * - :ref:`geoWithin <geowithin-ref>`
     - Queries for points within specified geographic shapes.
     - :ref:`geo <bson-data-types-geo>`

   * - :ref:`in <in-ref>`
     - Queries both single value and array of values.
     - | :ref:`boolean <boolean-ref>`
       | :ref:`date <bson-data-types-date>`
       | :ref:`objectId <objectId-ref>`

       | :ref:`uuid <bson-data-types-uuid>`

   * - :ref:`knnBeta <knn-beta-ref>` 
     - (Deprecated) Performs semantic search using |hnsw| algorithm.
     - :ref:`knnVector <fts-data-types-knn-vector>`

   * - :ref:`moreLikeThis <more-like-this-ref>`
     - Queries for similar documents.
     - :ref:`string <bson-data-types-string>`

   * - :ref:`near <near-ref>`
     - Queries for values near a specified :ref:`number
       <bson-data-types-number>`, :ref:`date <bson-data-types-date>`, or
       :ref:`geo point <bson-data-types-geo>`.
     - | :ref:`date <bson-data-types-date>`
       | :ref:`geo point <bson-data-types-geo>`
       | :ref:`number <bson-data-types-number>`

   * - :ref:`span <span-ref>` 
     - (Deprecated) Specifies relative positional requirements for query
       predicates within specified regions of a text field.
     - :ref:`string <bson-data-types-string>`

   * - :ref:`text <text-ref>`
     - Performs textual analyzed search.
     - :ref:`string <bson-data-types-string>`

Collectors
----------

The following table describes the collectors that can be used inside of the :pipeline:`$search`
and :pipeline:`$searchMeta` aggregation pipeline stages to return a document representing the 
:ref:`metadata results <fts-metadata-results>` of your |fts| query. This results document
is typically an aggregation over the matching |fts| query results. The
table also shows the |fts| :ref:`field types <bson-data-types>` that the
collector supports.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 50 30

   * - Collector
     - Description
     - Supported Field Types

   * - :ref:`facet <fts-facet-ref>`
     - Groups query results by values or ranges in specified, faceted 
       fields and returns the count for each of those groups.
     - | :ref:`date <bson-data-types-date>`
       | :ref:`number <bson-data-types-number>`
       | :ref:`token <bson-data-types-token>` (string)
