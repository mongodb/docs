The ``hosts`` resource defines the ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` processes
in your deployment. Each process is identified by a unique hostname and
port combination. When you add a ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` to |mms|,
|mms| automatically discovers various valid hostname and port
combinations for the process. DNS records the names you can use to
access a given host. |mms| ranks the hostnames to choose a "primary"
hostname. Hostnames with the most periods rank highest, while the
loopback address (``127.0.0.1``) and ``localhost`` lowest. |mms| treats
the "losing" hostnames as host aliases.

When |mms| receives a ping from the {+magent+}, the algorithm for
assigning a primary hostname repeats. As a result, the primary hostname
may change over time. You can also
:ref:`specify preferred hostnames <group-settings-page>` in |mms|'s
project settings to override the hostname algorithm.
