      * - MongoDB Version
        - Supported on ``M10+``
        - Supported on Free and Shared Tiers (``M0``, ``M2``, ``M5``)

      * - MongoDB 4.0
        - :icon:`check-square`

      * - MongoDB 4.2
        - :icon:`check-square`
        - 

      * - MongoDB 4.4

   availability.

   |service| always upgrades the cluster to the latest stable release
   of the specified version via a rolling process to maintain cluster
   availability.

   You cannot downgrade the cluster to an earlier MongoDB version.

   You can switch from using the :guilabel:`Latest Release` to using a
   specific release only if the latest MongoDB version is a major
   release.
