.. include:: /includes/5.1-fact-sharded-lookup-graphlookup.rst

.. _6.0-rel-notes-change-streams:

Change Streams
--------------

Optimized Change Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |change-streams| replace:: :ref:`change streams <changeStreams>`

.. include:: /includes/change-streams-optimization.rst


``wallTime`` Change Stream Output Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, the :ref:`change stream output
<change-stream-output>` has a new ``wallTime`` field that contains the
server date and time of the database operation.

Change Streams with Document Pre- and Post-Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can use :ref:`change streams
<change-stream-output>` to output the version of a document before and
after changes (the document pre- and post-images). For examples, see
:ref:`db.collection.watch-change-streams-pre-and-post-images-example`.

Change Stream Expanded Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, change streams can show additional
change events for DDL operations, like creating indexes and dropping
collections.

For more information, see :ref:`Expanded Events <change-streams-expanded-events>`.

Cluster Administration
----------------------

Cluster Server Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can use :ref:`<cluster-parameters>` to modify 
and retrieve configuration options for all nodes in a replica set or sharded 
cluster. You can use :dbcommand:`setClusterParameter` to modify cluster-wide 
options and :dbcommand:`getClusterParameter` to retrieve the value of a cluster 
parameter.

Connection Pool Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can use
:parameter:`ShardingTaskExecutorPoolMinSizeForConfigServers` and
:parameter:`ShardingTaskExecutorPoolMaxSizeForConfigServers` to set the
minimum and maximum sharding TaskExecutor connection pool size for
:ref:`configuration servers <sharding-config-server>`.

``changeStreamOptions`` Cluster Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can use :parameter:`changeStreamOptions` to control 
the retention policy of change stream pre- and post-images.

``internalSessionsReapThreshold`` Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can use the new
:parameter:`internalSessionsReapThreshold` parameter to set the session
limit for internal session metadata deletion.

Multiple Arbiters Unsupported
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/support-multiple-arbiters.rst

Clustered Collections
---------------------

.. include:: /includes/clustered-collections-introduction.rst

To learn about the benefits compared to a normal collection, see
:ref:`clustered-collections`.

Indexes
-------

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, you can use the :dbcommand:`collMod` database
command to add the ``expireAfterSeconds`` option to an existing
single-field non-TTL index.

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can use the ``prepareUnique`` and
``unique`` options for the :dbcommand:`collMod` command to convert an
existing standard index to a unique index.

Partial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can use the operators :query:`$in` and :query:`$or` 
to create :ref:`partial indexes <index-type-partial>`. The ``partialFilterExpression`` 
maximum depth is also expanded from 2 to 4. You can now use the operators :query:`$and`
and :query:`$or` at non-top-levels.

Installation
------------

SELinux Policies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, there is a new SE Linux Policy for:

- MongoDB Enterprise Server
- MongoDB Community Edition Server

running on Red Hat Linux. The SELinux policy is for use with default
installations using ``rpm`` installer packages.

Replica Sets
------------

Multiple Arbiters Unsupported
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/support-multiple-arbiters.rst

``initialSyncMethod`` Parameter                                            
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                            

Starting in MongoDB 5.2, the :parameter:`initialSyncMethod` determines  
whether :ref:`initial sync <replica-set-initial-sync>` is a                
:ref:`logical initial sync <replica-set-initial-sync-logical>` or a        
:ref:`file copy based initial sync                                         
<replica-set-initial-sync-file-copy-based>`.

:parameter:`initialSyncMethod` is only available in MongoDB Enterprise  
Server.

Specify Secondary Oplog Batch Delay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can use the
:parameter:`oplogBatchDelayMillis` server parameter to specify a delay
for writes of oplog batches on secondaries. Adding a short oplog batch
delay can reduce :abbr:`IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)` on
secondaries, but adds latency for writes with write concern
:writeconcern:`"majority"`.

For more information, see :parameter:`oplogBatchDelayMillis`.

Security
--------

Audit Log Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.0 Enterprise, you can encrypt the MongoDB audit
log.

To configure the audit log, see
:ref:`security-encryption-at-rest-audit-log`.

Sharding
--------

Default Chunk Size Increased from 64 MB to 128 MB 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.2, the 
:ref:`default chunk size <sharding-chunk-size>` is 128 megabytes. In 
earlier versions of MongoDB, the default chunk size is 64 megabytes.

``enableSharding`` No Longer Required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, the :dbcommand:`enableSharding` command is
no longer required to shard a collection.

Monitor Defragmentation Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/sharding/balancer-status-defrag-release-notes.rst

.. _6.0-rel-notes-sbe:

Slot-Based Query Execution Engine
---------------------------------

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, MongoDB uses a new query execution engine for
eligible queries, called the slot-based query execution engine. If the
slot-based query execution engine is used, new fields are included in
the query explain plan output.

- The new query execution engine is used if possible.

- If the new query execution engine is used, new fields are included in
  the :ref:`query explain plan output <explain-results-5.1-later>`.

|sbe-title| Can Execute ``$group`` and ``$lookup`` Stages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 6.0, MongoDB uses the |sbe| to execute eligible 
:pipeline:`$group` and :pipeline:`$lookup` stages when certain 
conditions are met.

For more information, see :ref:`sbe-pipeline-optimizations`.

Set |sbe-title| Plan Cache Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set the size of the :ref:`plan cache
<read-operations-query-optimization>` for the new query engine with the
:parameter:`planCacheSize` parameter.

.. include:: /includes/fact-sbe-plan-cache-motivation.rst
