  Download the sample app from `github <https://github.com/skerschb/testauth>`_ or clone the repo.

  To clone the repo:

  .. code-block:: sh
     
     git clone git@github.com:skerschb/testauth.git

  Look in the ``src`` folder. In the ``index.js`` toward the top of the file you will see an import
  statement that shows the Stitch package you will need to install to run this application.

  .. literalinclude:: /driver-examples/react_stitch_google.js
     :language: javascript
     :dedent: 2
     :start-after: start stitch import
     :end-before: end stitch import

  Run ``npm install`` to install the module required.

  .. code-block:: sh
     
     npm install mongodb-stitch-browser-sdk

  In ``index.js`` you will also see a method called ``setupStitch()``.
  This method is where the stitch client is initialized or assigned,
  and then checked for auth.

  .. literalinclude:: /driver-examples/react_stitch_google.js
     :language: javascript
     :dedent: 4
     :start-after: start stitch setup
     :end-before: end stitch setup

  Once you have downloaded or cloned the app, use ``npm`` to install
  any remaining dependencies (the Stitch dependency has already been
  installed as part of Step 1).

  .. code-block:: sh
     
     npm install

title: Modify the package.json.
ref: modify-package_json
level: 4
stepnum: 3
content: |
  ``npm`` will install dependencies in the ``node_modules`` directory.

  After the packages are installed, there are a few parameters in the
  package.json you will need to modify in order to deploy the application,
  in particular the ``deploy`` and ``homepage`` attributes.

  Consult the instructions for your deployment environment for the correct
  parameters to add to your package.json. The package.json that is included
  in the sample app uses `Github Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_ .

  Once you have modified your parameters, it's time to deploy your application.

  .. code-block:: sh
     
     npm run deploy

  Once you have deployed your application, check the url for which you have set up
  Google OAuth. You should be directed to a google login page. Once you authenticate,
  the application will render your username on the page.
