Overview
--------

On this page, you can see copyable code examples of common
methods that you can use to write data to MongoDB by using the
{+driver-short+}.

.. tip::

   To learn more about any of the methods shown on this page, see the link
   provided in each section.

To use an example from this page, copy the code example into the
