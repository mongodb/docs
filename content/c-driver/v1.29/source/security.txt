Overview
--------

MongoDB supports multiple mechanisms that you can use to authenticate your application.
This page contains code examples that demonstrate each of these mechanisms.

.. tip::

   To learn more about any of the mechanisms shown on this page, see the link
   provided in each section.

To use an authentication example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <c-auth-sample>` or your own application.
Make sure to replace all placeholders in the code examples, such as ``<hostname>``, with
the relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.

   :emphasize-lines: 14-16

SCRAM-SHA-256
-------------

The following code shows how to authenticate by using the ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
authentication mechanism:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
   :language: c
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: // start-scram-sha-256
   :end-before: // end-scram-sha-256

To learn more about SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication, see :ref:`c-scram-sha-256` in
the Authentication guide.

SCRAM-SHA-1
-----------

The following code shows how to authenticate by using the ``SCRAM-SHA-1``
authentication mechanism:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
   :language: c
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: // start-scram-sha-1
   :end-before: // end-scram-sha-1

To learn more about SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication, see :ref:`c-scram-sha-1` in
the Authentication guide.

MONGODB X.509
-------------

The following code shows how to create a connection URI to authenticate by using
the ``X.509`` authentication mechanism:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
   :language: c
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: // start-x509
   :end-before: // end-x509

To learn more about X.509 authentication, see :ref:`c-mongodb-x509` in
the Authentication guide.

MONGODB-AWS
-----------

The following sections show how to connect to MongoDB by using the ``MONGODB-AWS``
authentication mechanism. When you use the ``MONGODB-AWS`` mechanism, the {+driver-short+}
attempts to retrieve your AWS credentials from the following sources, in the order listed:

1. Named parameters passed to the connection URI
#. Environment variables
#. AWS EKS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity request
#. ECS container metadata
#. EC2 instance metadata
 
Each section shows how to authenticate with ``MONGODB-AWS`` when retrieving your
AWS credentials from a connection URI or the alternative external sources.

To learn more about authenticating with AWS, see :ref:`c-mongodb-aws` in the
Authentication guide.

Connection URI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to pass AWS credentials in a connection URI
to authenticate with ``MONGODB-AWS``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
   :language: c
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: // start-aws-connection-uri
   :end-before: // end-aws-connection-uri

To learn more about authenticating with AWS by retrieving connection URI
credentials, see :ref:`c-mongo-aws-connection-uri` in the Authentication
guide.

External Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to authenticate with ``MONGODB-AWS`` when
obtaining credentials from environment variables, ECS metadata, or EC2
instance metadata:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/security/authentication.c
   :language: c
   :copyable: true
   :start-after: // start-aws-environment
   :end-before: // end-aws-environment

To learn more about authenticating with AWS by obtaining external
credentials, see the following sections in the Authentication guide:

- :ref:`c-mongo-aws-environment`
- :ref:`c-mongo-aws-ecs`
- :ref:`c-mongo-aws-ecs`
