This page guides you through enabling the {+asql+} Interface quickly. 
If you follow the Quick Start steps, it results in an {+asql+}-specific 
{+fdi+} that maps to data on the cluster that you used to enable 
{+asql+}. You cannot modify this {+fdi+}, but you can delete it.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Any |service| cluster running MongoDB version 5.0 or higher and 
  containing data. You can use your own data or import MongoDB 
  :ref:`sample data <sample-data>`.

- A :ref:`MongoDB database user <mongodb-users>` with which 
  to connect.

Enable {+asql+} for Your Cluster Data
--------------------------------------

To enable the {+asql+} Interface with an |service|-managed {+fdi+}:

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. step:: On the deployment you want to query with SQL, connect with :guilabel:`Atlas SQL`.

      Click the :guilabel:`Connect` link at the bottom of your 
      deployment card, under :guilabel:`Atlas SQL`.

      A connection dialog box opens.

   .. step:: Select :guilabel:`Quick Start`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Create` to create an |service| SQL connection for your cluster.
      

      |service| creates and manages a {+fdi+} in the background to 
      support the SQL connection.
         
      To view or delete the {+fdi+} created with 
      :guilabel:`Quick Start`:
         
      .. include:: /includes/nav/list-data-federation.rst
         
         Your {+fdi+} appears under :guilabel:`Quick Start {+asql+} 
         {+fdi+}`. You cannot modify this {+fdi+}.

   .. step:: From the :guilabel:`Select your driver` dropdown, select a driver.

   .. step:: Select a database and copy your connection settings.

      Select a database from the :guilabel:`Database` dropdown.

      Save your connection information. You'll need this 
      in a later step.

Next Steps
----------

You have now successfully enabled {+asql+} on a {+fdi+} that maps data 
on the database in the |service| cluster that you specified.

To connect to this {+fdi+} and query your data with {+asql+}, see 
:ref:`Connect <sql-connect>`.
