      - New Organizations and Projects Hierarchy

          - |service| provides a new :doc:`organizations and projects
            hierarchy <organizations-projects>` to facilitate the
            management of your |service| clusters. Groups are now known
            as Projects. You can put multiple Projects under an
            Organization.

          - :ref:`Teams <manage-teams>`. |service| provides the ability
            to group organization users into :ref:`Teams
            <manage-teams>` to faciliate adding multiple users to
            projects.

      - Support for management of the :doc:`MongoDB Connector for
        Business Intelligence </tutorial/deploy-bi-connector>`.
  
      - :ref:`Real-Time Metrics Tab <real-time-metrics-status-tab>`.

      - :doc:`Queryable Backup </tutorial/query-backup/>`.

      - :doc:`Data Explorer view <data-explorer>` provides the ability to introspect collections.
 
      - New :doc:`Agent API Key Model </tutorial/manage-agent-api-key>`.

      - New MongoDB Backup Restore utility for Point in Time restores.

      - Ability to :doc:`restore </tutorial/nav/backup-restore-deployments>` to
        deployments in a different project.

      - Navigation Enhancements:

        - The :guilabel:`Settings` view in the left-hand navigation bar
          now contains only the group-level settings.

          To access user-specific settings, click on your user name in
          the upper-right hand corner and select :guilabel:`Account`.

        - The :guilabel:`Users` view (i.e. |mms| users who belong
          to the group) is now available directly from the left-hand
          navigation bar.

   For more information, see the :ref:`release notes <opsmgr-server-3.6>`.
