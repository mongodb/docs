Overview
--------

This page describes some popular third-party libraries for working with {+driver-short+}.
With the exception of Motor, all libraries on this page are maintained by the community.
To keep this list current, projects that haven't been updated recently will
occasionally be removed from the list or moved to the end.

.. tip::

   Although these libraries can be helpful, we recommend that new {+driver-short+} users
   begin by working directly with the driver. {+driver-short+} alone will meet most people's
   needs, and working with it is instructive in how MongoDB works.

ORM-like Layers
---------------

ORM-like (object-relational-mapping-like) layers add features like models and validation to
{+driver-short+}.

- `MincePy <https://mincepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ is an
  object-document mapper (ODM) designed to make any Python object storable
  and queryable in a MongoDB database. It was designed with machine learning
  and big-data computational and experimental science applications in mind.
  However, it's entirely general and can be useful to anyone looking to organize,
  share, or process large amounts of data with as little change to their current
  workflow as possible.

- `Ming <https://ming.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ is a
  library that allows you to enforce schemas on a MongoDB database in
  your Python application. It was developed by `SourceForge
  <http://sourceforge.net/>`__ in the course of their migration to
  MongoDB. See the `introductory blog post
  <http://blog.pythonisito.com/2009/12/ming-01-released-python-library-for.html>`__
  for more details.

- `MongoEngine <https://mongoengine-odm.readthedocs.io/>`__ lets you use syntax inspired
  by the Django ORM to define schemas for documents and query collections.
  The code is available on `GitHub
  <http://github.com/mongoengine/mongoengine>`__.

- `MotorEngine <https://motorengine.readthedocs.io/>`__ is a port of
  MongoEngine to Motor, allowing asynchronous access with Tornado.
  It implements the same modeling APIs in a data-portable way, meaning that a
  model defined in MongoEngine can be read in MotorEngine. The source is
  available on `GitHub <http://github.com/heynemann/motorengine>`__.

- `uMongo <https://umongo.readthedocs.io/>`__ is a Python MongoDB ODM that
  was created to meet two needs: the lack of an asynchronous ODM and the
  difficulty of serializing documents with other ODMs.
  uMongo works with multiple drivers: PyMongo, TxMongo, motor_asyncio, and
  mongomock. The source is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/Scille/umongo>`__.

Framework Tools
---------------

This section lists tools and adapters that have been designed to work with
various Python frameworks and libraries.

Django
~~~~~~

Even without a Django backend, you can use MongoDB and {+driver-short+} with most of
what Django provides. Certain features of Django that require
``django.db``, such as admin, authentication, and sessions, will not work
when using only MongoDB.

- `Django MongoDB Engine <https://django-mongodb-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
  is a MongoDB database backend for Django that
  supports Django aggregations, atomic updates, embedded objects, Map/Reduce, and GridFS.
  It allows you to use most of Django's built-in features, including the ORM, admin,
  authentication, site and session frameworks, and caching. For more information, see the
  `Django MongoDB Engine tutorial <https://django-mongodb-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html>`__.

- `Django MongoEngine <https://github.com/MongoEngine/django-mongoengine>`__ is a
  MongoDB backend for
  Django. The repository also includes an `example application <https://github.com/MongoEngine/django-mongoengine/tree/master/example/tumblelog>`__.
  For more information, see the `Django MongoEngine documentation <https://django-mongoengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

- `Djongo <https://www.djongomapper.com/>`__ is a connector for using
  Django with MongoDB as the database backend. With Djongo, you can use the Django Admin
  GUI to add and modify documents in MongoDB.
  The `Djongo source code <https://github.com/doableware/djongo>`__ is hosted on GitHub,
  and the `Djongo package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/djongo>`__ is on PyPI.

- `mango <http://github.com/vpulim/mango>`__ provides MongoDB backends for
  Django sessions and authentication (bypassing ``django.db`` entirely).

Flask
~~~~~

- `Flask-MongoAlchemy <http://github.com/cobrateam/flask-mongoalchemy/>`__ adds
  Flask support for MongoDB with MongoAlchemy.

- `Flask-MongoKit <http://github.com/jarus/flask-mongokit/>`__ is a Flask extension
  to better integrate MongoKit into Flask.

- `Flask-PyMongo <http://github.com/dcrosta/flask-pymongo/>`__ bridges Flask and PyMongo.

Other Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~

- `Full Stack FastAPI App Generator <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/full-stack-fastapi-mongodb>`__
  enables you to quickly spin up a full-stack application
  that integrates FastAPI, React, and MongoDB.

- `Log4Mongo <https://github.com/log4mongo/log4mongo-python>`__ is a flexible
  Python logging handler that can store logs in MongoDB by using normal and capped
  collections.

- `mongobox <http://github.com/theorm/mongobox>`__ is a tool to run a sandboxed
  MongoDB instance from within a Python app.

- `mongodb_beaker <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mongodb_beaker>`__ enables you to use MongoDB
  as a backend for `Beaker's <https://beaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
  caching and session system.
  The source is on `GitHub <http://github.com/bwmcadams/mongodb_beaker>`__.

- `MongoLog <http://github.com/puentesarrin/mongodb-log/>`__ is a Python logging
  handler that stores logs in MongoDB by using a capped collection.

- `rod.recipe.mongodb <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rod.recipe.mongodb/>`__ is a
  `Buildout <https://www.buildout.org/en/latest/contents.html>`__ recipe for downloading
  and installing MongoDB.

Interoperability Tools
----------------------

This section lists tools that support interopability with other tools.

.. _pymongo-gevent:

gevent
~~~~~~

{+driver-short+} uses thread and socket functions from the Python standard library.
By using `gevent <http://www.gevent.org/>`__, {+driver-short+}
can do asynchronous I/O with non-blocking sockets and schedule operations
on `greenlets <https://pypi.org/project/greenlet/>`__ instead of threads.

To use gevent with {+driver-short+}, call gevent's
``monkey.patch_all()`` method *before* loading any other modules, as shown in the following
example:

.. code-block:: python

   # You must call patch_all() *before* importing any other modules
   from gevent import monkey
   _ = monkey.patch_all()
   from pymongo import MongoClient
   client = MongoClient()

.. important:: Close MongoClient to Avoid Blocking

   If you call ``monkey.patch_all()`` when your application launches, ``MongoClient``
   will use greenlets instead of threads to monitor the health of the server.
   When shutting down, if your application calls the ``~gevent.hub.Hub.join()`` method
   without first terminating these greenlets,
   the call to the ``~gevent.hub.Hub.join()`` method blocks indefinitely.
   
   To avoid this, close or dereference any active ``MongoClient`` objects before exiting
   your application. In some application frameworks, you can use a signal handler
   to end background greenlets when your application receives ``SIGHUP``, as shown
   in the following example:

   .. code-block:: python

      import signal

      def graceful_reload(signum, traceback):
           """Explicitly close some global MongoClient object."""
           client.close()

      signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, graceful_reload)

   This issue affects applications using uWSGI versions earlier than 1.9.16
   or newer uWSGI versions with the ``-gevent-wait-for-hub`` option.
   For more information, see
   the `uWSGI changelog <https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Changelog-1.9.16.html#important-change-in-the-gevent-plugin-shutdown-reload-procedure>`__.

.. _pymongo-mod_wsgi:

mod_wsgi
~~~~~~~~

The `mod_wsgi <https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/>`__ package provides an
Apache module that implements a WSGI-compliant interface for hosting Python-based
web applications on top of the Apache web server.

To run your {+driver-short+} application under mod_wsgi, follow these guidelines:

- Use the ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` directive to run mod_wsgi in daemon mode. If your
  mod_wsgi configuration includes only the ``WSGIScriptAlias`` directive,
  it will run in embedded mode.

- Use the ``WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}`` directive to ensure your application runs
  in the daemon's main Python interpreter, rather than a sub-interpreter. This
  avoids a small cost incurred when decoding BSON in a sub-interpreter.

- Use the ``WSGIProcessGroup`` directive to assign each application to a separate daemon.
  This ensures the applications don't affect each other's state.

The following mod_wsgi configuration shows how to use the preceding directives to run your
{+driver-short+} application:

.. code-block:: python

   <VirtualHost *>
       WSGIDaemonProcess my_process
       WSGIScriptAlias /my_app /path/to/app.wsgi
       WSGIProcessGroup my_process
       WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
   </VirtualHost>

If you have multiple {+driver-short+} applications, put each in a separate
daemon in the global application group:

.. code-block:: python

   <VirtualHost *>
       WSGIDaemonProcess my_process
       WSGIScriptAlias /my_app /path/to/app.wsgi
       <Location /my_app>
           WSGIProcessGroup my_process
       </Location>

       WSGIDaemonProcess my_other_process
       WSGIScriptAlias /my_other_app /path/to/other_app.wsgi
       <Location /my_other_app>
           WSGIProcessGroup my_other_process
       </Location>

       WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
   </VirtualHost>

.. note::

   Many Python C extensions have issues when running in multiple
   Python sub-interpreters. These difficulties are explained in the documentation for
   `Py_NewInterpreter <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_NewInterpreter>`__
   and in the `Multiple Python Sub Interpreters <https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/master/user-guides/application-issues.html#multiple-python-sub-interpreters>`__
   section of the mod_wsgi documentation.

Alternative Python Drivers
--------------------------

This section lists alternatives to {+driver-short+}.

- `Motor <https://github.com/mongodb/motor>`__ is a full-featured, non-blocking
  MongoDB driver for Python Tornado applications.

- `TxMongo <https://github.com/twisted/txmongo>`__ is an asynchronous Twisted
  Python driver for MongoDB.

- `MongoMock <https://github.com/mongomock/mongomock>`__ is a small
  library to help test Python code. It uses {+driver-short+} to interact with MongoDB.

.. note:: {+driver-short+} is Incompatible with PythonAnywhere

   {+driver-short+} creates Python threads, which
   `PythonAnywhere <https://www.pythonanywhere.com>`__ does not support.

   For more information, see
   the relevant `Jira ticket. <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-1495>`__
