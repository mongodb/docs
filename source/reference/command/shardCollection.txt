.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: shardCollection

   The :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command marks a collection for sharding and
   will allow data to begin distributing among shards. You must run
   :dbcommand:`enableSharding` on a database before running the
   :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { shardCollection: "<dabase>.<collection>", key: <shardkey> }

   This enables sharding for the collection specified by
   ``<collection>`` in the database named ``<db>``, using the key
   ``<shardkey>`` to distribute documents among the
   shard. ``<shardkey>`` is a document, and takes the same form as an
   :ref:`index specification document <document-index-specification>`.

   :param string shardCollection:

      Specify the namespace of a collection to shard in the form
      ``<database>.<collection>``.

   :param document key:

      Specify the index specification to use as the shard key.  The
      index must exist prior to the :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command
      unless the collection is empty.  If the collection is empty, then
      MongoDB will create the index prior to sharding the collection.

      .. versionadded:: 2.4
         The key may be in the form ``{ field : "hashed" }`` which will
         use the specified field as a hashed shard key.

   :param integer numInitialChunks:

      .. versionadded:: 2.4

      Specify the number of chunks to create upon sharding the
      collection. The collection will then be pre-split and balanced
      across the specified number of chunks.

      You can specify no more than ``8192`` chunks using
      ``numInitialChunks``.

   Choosing the right shard key to effectively distribute load among
   your shards requires some planning. Also review
   :ref:`sharding-shard-key` regarding choosing a shard key.
