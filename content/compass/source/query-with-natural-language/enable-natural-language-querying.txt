be a helpful starting point and assist you in learning to write MongoDB 
queries.

To enable natural language querying in |compass-short|, follow the steps below. 
Alternatively, you can enable natural language querying by clicking the 
:guilabel:`Log in to Atlas to enable` button within the 
:guilabel:`Use natural language to generate queries and pipelines` modal. 
You can display this modal on |compass-short| versions 1.40.0 or later when
you click the :guilabel:`Generate query` or 
:guilabel:`Generate aggregation` button on the query bar.
