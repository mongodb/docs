Download and Install
====================

Complete the following steps to install the {+driver-short+} and
its dependencies in your development environment.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Install the driver dependencies
    
      Before you begin this tutorial, ensure that you install
      the following dependencies:

      - `JDK <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html>`__ 
        version 8 or later 
      - Integrated development environment (IDE), such as `IntelliJ IDEA <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/>`__
        or `Eclipse <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/>`__

      .. note::

         This tutorial shows how to install the {+driver-short+} by using
         Maven or Gradle in an IDE. If you do not use an IDE, visit `Building Maven
         <https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-building-maven.html>`__
         or `Creating New Gradle Builds <https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/>`__
         to learn how to set up your project.

   .. step:: Install the {+driver-short+}

      In your IDE, create a new `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ or `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__
      project. If you use Maven, add the following code to your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:

      .. code-block:: xml

         <dependencies>
             <dependency>
                 <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
                 <artifactId>mongodb-driver-sync</artifactId>
                 <version>{+full-version+}</version>
             </dependency>
         </dependencies>

      If you use Gradle, add the following code to your ``build.gradle`` dependencies list:

      .. code-block:: groovy
        
         dependencies {
           implementation 'org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-sync:{+full-version+}'
         }
      
      After you configure your dependencies, ensure they are available to your
      project by running your dependency manager and refreshing
      the project in your IDE.
      
After you complete these steps, you have a new project 
and the driver dependencies installed.
