You can restore archived data archived to your |service| cluster. 
You must use the :pipeline:`$match` and :adl:`$out 
</reference/pipeline/out>` pipeline stages to get the archived 
data into a temporary collection and use the :pipeline:`$merge` 
to move the data back into the original collection.

This page describes how to restore using :pipeline:`$match`, 
:adl:`$out </reference/pipeline/out>`, and :pipeline:`$merge` 
pipeline stages.
