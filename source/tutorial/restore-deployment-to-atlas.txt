You can automatically restore a backup for a |mms| deployment to a |service|
deployment. |service-short| is a fully-managed cloud database that handles the
complexities of deploying, managing, and healing deployments running on
the AWS, Azure, and Google cloud providers.

Prerequisites
-------------

See :ref:`Prerequisites <prerequisites-automatic-restore>` for a list
of prerequisites required for all automatic restores to |service-short| deployments.
In addition, you must have the following roles to perform this procedure:

* :authrole:`Project Backup Admin` on the source |mms| deployment

* :authrole:`Project Owner` on the target |service-short| deployment

If you have not yet created a destination |service-short| cluster, see
`Create a Cluster <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/create-new-cluster/>`_.

.. note::

   Your |service-short| deployment must use M10 or larger instance nodes. Shared Cluster
   Tier deployments do not support restoring snapshots from |mms| clusters.

   You cannot restore a |mms| backup snapshot to an |service-short| deployment
   with `Encryption at Rest <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security-aws-kms/index.html>`_
   enabled.


Considerations
--------------

Before you restore a snapshot from a |mms| deployment to an 
|service-short| deployment, ensure that the hosts for your |service-short| 
deployment have sufficient storage space for the restored databases, plus 
additional space for dataset growth. Use :manual:`db.stats() </reference/method/db.stats/>`
to find the current database size. 

The MongoDB server version must be one of the following:

* The same on both deployments.

* One version higher on the |service-short| deployment. 

In addition, the instance types of the nodes in the |service-short| deployment 
should have at least as much memory and throughput capacity as the nodes in the 
|mms| deployment.
