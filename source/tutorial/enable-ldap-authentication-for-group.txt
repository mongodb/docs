`MongoDB Enterprise
<http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise?jmp=docs>`_ provides
support for proxy authentication of users. This allows administrators to
configure a MongoDB cluster to authenticate users by proxying
authentication requests to a specified Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol (LDAP) service.

.. next 2 paragraphs stolen from the MongoDB Manual

MongoDB Enterprise for Windows does **not** include LDAP support for
authentication. However, MongoDB Enterprise for Linux supports using
LDAP authentication with an ActiveDirectory server.

MongoDB does not support LDAP authentication in mixed sharded cluster
deployments that contain both version 2.4 and version 2.6 shards.

The :manual:`Authenticate Using SASL and LDAP with ActiveDirectory
</tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-activedirectory/>` and
:manual:`Authenticate Using SASL and LDAP with OpenLDAP
</tutorial/configure-ldap-sasl-openldap>` tutorials in the MongoDB
manual provide more information about setting up LDAP and SASL for
MongoDB. Setting up LDAP and SASL is beyond the scope of this document.
