Threading
=========

Libbson's data structures are *NOT* thread-safe. You are responsible for accessing and mutating these
structures from one thread at a time.

Libbson requires POSIX threads (pthreads) on all UNIX-like platforms. On Windows, the native threading
interface is used. Libbson uses your system's threading library to safely generate unique `ObjectIds
<{+api-libbson+}/bson_oid_t.html>`__, and to provide a fallback implementation for atomic operations on
platforms without built-in atomics.
