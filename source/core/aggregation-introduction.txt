Aggregation Introduction
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. start-primer-excerpt

*Aggregations* are operations that process data records and return
computed results. MongoDB provides a rich set of aggregation
operations that examine and perform calculations on the data sets.
Running data aggregation on the :program:`mongod` instance simplifies
application code and limits resource requirements.

Like queries, aggregation operations in MongoDB use :term:`collections
<collection>` of documents as an input and return results in the form
of one or more documents.

Aggregation Modalities
----------------------

Aggregation Pipelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.2 introduced a new :doc:`aggregation framework
</core/aggregation-pipeline>`, modeled on the concept of data
processing pipelines. Documents enter a multi-stage pipeline that
transforms the documents into an aggregated result.

The most basic pipeline stages provide *filters* that operate like
queries and *document transformations* that modify the form
of the output document.

Other pipeline operations provide tools for grouping and sorting
documents by specific field or fields as well as tools for aggregating
the contents of arrays, including arrays of documents. In addition,
pipeline stages can use :ref:`operators
<aggregation-expression-operators>` for tasks such as calculating the
average or concatenating a string.

The pipeline provides efficient data aggregation using native
operations within MongoDB, and is the preferred method for data
aggregation in MongoDB.

Map-Reduce
~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB also provides :doc:`map-reduce </core/map-reduce>` operations
to perform aggregation. In general, map-reduce operations have two
phases: a *map* stage that processes each document and *emits* one or
more objects for each input document, and *reduce* phase that combines
the output of the map operation. Optionally, map-reduce can have a
*finalize* stage to make final modifications to the result. Like other
aggregation operations, map-reduce can specify a query condition to
select the input documents as well as sort and limit the results.

Map-reduce uses custom JavaScript functions to perform the map and
reduce operations, as well as the optional *finalize* operation. While
the custom JavaScript provide great flexibility compared to the
aggregation pipeline, in general, map-reduce is less efficient and more
complex than the aggregation pipeline.

.. note:: Starting in MongoDB 2.4, certain :program:`mongo` shell
   functions and properties are inaccessible in map-reduce
   operations. MongoDB 2.4 also provides support for multiple
   JavaScript operations to run at the same time. Before MongoDB 2.4,
   JavaScript code executed in a single thread, raising concurrency
   issues for map-reduce.

Single Purpose Aggregation Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a number of common :doc:`single purpose aggregation operations
</core/single-purpose-aggregation>`, MongoDB provides special purpose
database commands. These common
aggregation operations are: returning a count of matching documents,
returning the distinct values for a field, and grouping data based on
the values of a field. All of these operations aggregate documents from a
single collection. While these operations provide simple access to
common aggregation processes, they lack the flexibility and
capabilities of the aggregation pipeline and map-reduce.

Additional Features and Behaviors
---------------------------------

Both the aggregation pipeline and map-reduce can operate on a
:doc:`sharded collection </core/sharding-introduction>`. Map-reduce
operations can also output to a sharded collection. See
:doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline-sharded-collections` and
:doc:`/core/map-reduce-sharded-collections` for details.

The aggregation pipeline can use indexes to improve its performance
during some of its stages. In addition, the aggregation pipeline has an
internal optimization phase. See
:ref:`aggregation-pipeline-operators-and-performance` and
:doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline-optimization` for details.

map-reduce, and the special group functionality, see
