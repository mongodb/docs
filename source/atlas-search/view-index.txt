You can view an |fts| index definition in the :guilabel:`Index 
Overview` page. For each index, the :guilabel:`Index Overview` page 
shows the following: 

- :manual:`Namespace </reference/limits/#std-label-faq-dev-namespace>` 
  for the index.
- Index and search :ref:`analyzers <analyzers-ref>` specified in the 
  index definition.
- :ref:`Dynamic or static <static-dynamic-mappings>` mapping.
- Field mappings in the :ref:`index definition 
  <ref-index-definitions>`, if any, including field name, data type, 
  and whether dynamic mapping is enabled for the individual field.

This page describes how to view your index definition in the 
:guilabel:`Index Overview` page. You can also :ref:`ref-edit-index` 
with the visual or |json| editor in the :guilabel:`Index Overview` 
page.

.. _search-index-node-status:

In the {+atlas-ui+}, the |fts| page displays information about |fts| indexes
for the collections. The page displays the following details for each
index on the {+cluster+}. 

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/atlas-search/search-indexes.rst  

You can sort the indexes by the various columns. By default, |service|
sorts the indexes by first the database name and then the collection
name. To sort by multiple columns, press :kbd:`Shift` and click the
column names in the order in which you want to multi-sort the list of 
indexes. |service| doesn't save your preferred sorting order when you 
leave the page.

.. _search-index-statuses:

Review Index Statuses 
---------------------

For each index, the :guilabel:`Status` column shows the current state of
the index on the primary node of the {+cluster+}. The following table
describes the index statuses.       

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Status
     - Description

   * - Pending 
     - |service| has not yet started building the index.

   * - Building 
     - |service| is building the index or re-building the 
       index after an edit. When the index is in this state:
       
       - For a new index, |fts| doesn't serve queries until the 
         index build is complete. 
       - For an existing index, you can continue to use the old index 
         for existing and new queries until the index rebuild 
         is complete.

   * - Ready
     - Index is ready to use.

   * - Stale
     - Replication encountered an error. This state commonly occurs 
       when the current replication point is no longer available on the 
       |mongod| oplog. You can still query the existing index until it 
       updates and its status changes to :guilabel:`Active`. Use the 
       error in the :guilabel:`View status details` modal window to 
       troubleshoot the issue. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`atlas-search-alerts`.

   * - Failed 
     - |service| could not build the index. Use the error  
       in the :guilabel:`View status details` modal window to 
       troubleshoot the issue. To learn more, see 
       :ref:`atlas-search-alerts`.

   * - Deleting
     - |service| is deleting the index from the {+cluster+} nodes.

   * - Does not Exist
     - Index is invalid because the collection for the index no longer
       exists. You can't run queries on this index because there is no 
       corresponding collection for this index. |service| will
       eventually delete the index.

.. _search-index-details:

View Status Details 
-------------------

The :guilabel:`Status` column shows the current state of the index on
the primary node of the {+cluster+}. You can view detailed status in
one of the following ways:

- Click the :guilabel:`View status details` link below the status in the
  :guilabel:`Status` column.  
- Click the name of the index and then select :guilabel:`Status Details`
  from the menu on the left for the index. 

On this page, you can view the following details about the index:

.. _queryable-index:

Index Serving Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The index that is being used to serve queries. If you have only one
version of the index with this name for the collection, the section
contains a link to the :guilabel:`Index Overview` where you can find the
index definition for the index being used. 

If you had other indexes with the same name on the collection, the
section shows the latest index definition and also shows prior valid
versions of the index in different tabs that you can copy. 

When you update an index, different nodes apply the updates at different
speeds. Therefore, some nodes might use the latest version and some might
use the prior version. |service| displays both versions of the index
until the changes are applied to all the nodes. 

If you update the index and the updates to the index are invalid, the
index build will fail and |service| displays only the previous valid
index definition. 

.. _node-status-ref:

Status Details by Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
The status of the index on each node of the {+cluster+}. You can
see the following details about the index on each node: 

.. list-table:: 
   :stub-columns: 1 
   :widths: 25 75

   * - :guilabel:`Shard` 
     - Shard name. 

   * - :guilabel:`Node` 
     - Node information.
       
   * - :guilabel:`Status` 
     - Status of the index on the node in the shard. 

   * - :guilabel:`Queryable` 
     - Icon that indicates whether the index can serve queries. 

   * - :guilabel:`Message`
     - Reason for the index status. For indexes in ``Stale`` or
       ``Failed`` state, displays the reason why the index is stale or
       why the index build failed. 

   * - :guilabel:`Node Type` 
     - Type of node. Value can be one of the following types: 
       
       - Primary
       - Secondary 
       - Search Node

   * - :guilabel:`Region` 
     - Node region. 

   * - :guilabel:`Size` 
     - Size of the index on the node.

   * - :guilabel:`Documents` 
     - Number and percentage of indexed documents.  
         
   * - :guilabel:`Actions` 
     - Actions you can take on the index in the node. You can click the
       :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` and select one of the following options: 
       
       - :ref:`View metrics <review-atlas-search-metrics>`.
       - Copy the host name of the node. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-shardCollection-fts-indexes.rst

Migration to Search Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The status of the in-progress migration of your |fts| and {+avs+}
indexes to search nodes, if applicable. This is only visible if you are
currently migrating to search nodes.
