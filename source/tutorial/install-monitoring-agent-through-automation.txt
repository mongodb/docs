Collection Interval
+++++++++++++++++++

If a Monitoring Agent is abruptly stopped without using the |mms| interface,
|mms| will wait 5 minutes before redistributing that agentâ€™s monitoring
assignments, which means there can be up to a five-minute delay before another
Monitoring Agent begins collecting data and sending pings to |mms|. During
this interval, the restarted Monitoring Agent will not collect data.

Prerequisite
------------

{+aagent+}
++++++++++++++++

The {+aagent+} must be running on the server where you want to
deploy the Monitoring Agent. To install the {+aagent+}, see
:doc:`/tutorial/nav/automation-agent`.
