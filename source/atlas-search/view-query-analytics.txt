You can view metrics for the |fts| query terms tracked using the
``tracking`` option in the {+atlas-ui+} :guilabel:`Query Analytics` page
for the index that you used to query for the term. To learn how to tag
search terms in your queries, see :ref:`fts-tracking-ref`. 

This page describes the metrics that |service| captures for tracked
queries and how to view the query analytics for an |fts| index in the
{+atlas-ui+}. 

.. note:: 

   You must have an ``M10`` or higher cluster running MongoDB v5.0 or
   higher to view the analytics information for the tracked search terms
   in the {+atlas-ui+}. |fts| doesn't track search terms or display
   analytics for queries on free and shared-tier clusters.

Navigate to the Query Analytics Page 
------------------------------------

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-atlas-search.rst

   .. step:: Click the name of the index. 

      The page displays an overview of this index, including
      :guilabel:`Index Configurations` and :guilabel:`Field Mappings` in
      the index definition. The left-hand side of the page also provides 
      navigation options to the following pages:

      - :ref:`Index Overview <ref-index-definitions>` - View the
        configuration for this index
      - :ref:`Search Tester <searching-ref>` - Search your collection
        using this index
      - :ref:`Query Analytics <fts-tracking-ref>` - View analytics for your
        queries for tracked terms that used this index 
      - :ref:`Quick Start Tutorials <fts-tutorials>` - Access tutorials
        that can help you incorporate popular search features in your
        application

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Query Analytics` to view analytics for tracked queries run using this |fts| index.

      |service| displays query analytics for queries for tracked
      search terms that were run using only the selected index. 

View Query Analytics for Tracked Search Terms
---------------------------------------------

The :guilabel:`Query Analytics` page displays the following for a
predefined date range such as the current day, last 7 days, last 30
days, or last 90 days, or a custom range (in :abbr:`UTC (Coordinated 
Universal Time)`) that you specify, with a per day granularity:

Metrics for All Tracked $search Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section shows the following metrics: 
            
- :guilabel:`Approx # of Tracked $search Queries` - approximate count of 
  :pipeline:`$search` queries that included the ``tracking`` option.
- :guilabel:`Approx % of Top 10 Tracked Queries` - percentage 
  of :pipeline:`$search` queries with the ``tracking`` option that are
  also the top 10 queries.

The section also shows a graph of the number of tracked queries for the
selected date range.  

You can expand :guilabel:`Show Top Search Queries` below the graph to
view the following metrics:  

.. list-table:: 
   :stub-columns: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - :guilabel:`Search Terms` 
     - |fts| query terms (one per row).

   * - :guilabel:`Approx #`
     - Approximate number of all tracked :pipeline:`$search` queries for
       the term (in the same row). 
                 
   * - :guilabel:`Approx %`  
     - Approximate percentage of all tracked :pipeline:`$search` queries
       for the term (in the same row). This is the percentage of queries
       with the query term, out of the total number of queries, only on
       days when |service| captured the query during the selected date
       range. 
       
       For example, if you run a query for ``coffee``, |fts| calculates
       the percentage as follows: 

       - 4 queries for ``coffee`` out of a total of 8 queries on 
         captured days equals 50%.
       - 1 query for ``coffee`` out of a total of 2 queries on
         captured days equals 50%.

   * - :guilabel:`View`
     - Link to view the following metrics over a predefined or custom
       date range for the term (in the same row): 

       - Number of queries and percentage of tracked queries for the
         term in the selected date range.  
       - Graph of the number of tracked queries for the term during the
         selected date range. 

       Click :guilabel:`View factors affecting data` to open a window
       that displays the days when there were no recorded queries for
       the search term and information about factors that affect the
       metrics that |fts| displays on the page. To learn more, see
       :ref:`fts-factors-affecting-analytics-metrics`. You can click
       :guilabel:`Close` to dismiss the window.

       The :guilabel:`Aggregation pipeline Query` section displays the
       following:

       - :guilabel:`Sample aggregation pipeline` dropdown that shows the
         different queries that |service| captured for the term.         
       - :guilabel:`MongoDB API` tab that shows the {+mongosh+} query
         associated with the selected pipeline.
       - :guilabel:`Export to Language` tab that allows you
         to view, copy, and export query syntax in other
         supported MongoDB driver languages. 
       - :guilabel:`Open Aggregation Pipeline` link to open the
         :guilabel:`Aggregation` tab for the collection. To run your

         #. Click :guilabel:`Create New` in the :guilabel:`Aggregation`
            tab. 
         #. Enable :guilabel:`Preview` if it isn't already enabled and

       :guilabel:`Query Analytics` page. 

.. _fts-query-analytics-no-results-queries:

Metrics for Queries with no Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section shows the following metrics for queries for which |service| 
didn't return any results for the whole aggregation pipeline: 
            
- :guilabel:`Approx # of Search Queries With No Results` - approximate
  count of :pipeline:`$search` queries with the ``tracking`` option for
  which |fts| didn't return results. 
- :guilabel:`Approx % of Search Queries With No Results` - approximate
  percentage of :pipeline:`$search` queries with the ``tracking`` option
  for which |fts| didn't return any results.

For the selected date range, the section also shows a graph of the
number of tracked queries for which |fts| didn't return any results.

.. _fts-factors-affecting-analytics-metrics:

Factors That Affect Displayed Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many factors affect the metrics that are displayed on the page. 

|fts| query metrics is based on sampling, which can affect the accuracy
of all the displayed metrics. 
                       
In addition, |service| has a limit on the number of unique search terms
that |service| captures each day from tracked :pipeline:`$search`
queries. Once |service| reaches the limit, it doesn't capture new,
unique search terms. The following might be affected if |service|
reaches the limit:

- The approximate percentage of top 10 tracked queries 
- The order in which |service| displays the top search terms

Individual tracked search term metrics might be affected if |service|
stopped capturing before queries for a search term ran. On those days,
|service| doesn't display the number of searches for that search term,
resulting in a gap. 

To learn more, see :ref:`fts-tracking-behavior`.

Follow along with this video to learn how you can use query analytics to
retrieve metrics on the top 10 query terms and query terms for which
|fts| didn't return any results. Also learn how you can use
:ref:`synonyms <synonyms-ref>` to improve the search for terms for which
|fts| didn't return any results.
