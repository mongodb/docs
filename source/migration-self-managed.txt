You can bring data from existing MongoDB deployments, ``JSON`` or ``CSV`` files
into |service| using one of the following tools that you run outside of
|service|.

   * - Tool
     - Description

   * - |mongosync|

     - The |mongosync| binary is the primary process used in |c2c|.
       Use ``mongosync`` to migrate data from one {+cluster+} to a 
       {+cluster+} in |service|. |service| syncs data from the source to
       the destination {+cluster+} until you cut your applications over
       to the destination |service| {+cluster+}.

   * - :doc:`mongomirror </import/mongomirror>`

     - Migrate from a MongoDB *replica set* into an |service| cluster
       without shutting down your existing replica set or applications.
       :doc:`mongomirror </import/mongomirror>` does not import
       user/role data or copy the ``config`` database.

   * - :doc:`mongorestore </import/mongorestore>`

     - Seed an |service| cluster with a ``BSON`` data backup dump of an
       existing MongoDB deployment. :doc:`mongorestore </import/mongorestore>`
       does not restore ``system.profile`` collection data.

   * - :doc:`mongoimport </import/mongoimport>`

     - Load data from a ``JSON`` or a ``CSV`` file into an |service|
       cluster. :binary:`mongoimport` uses
       :manual:`strict mode representation for certain BSON types </reference/mongodb-extended-json>`.

   * - :compass:`MongoDB Compass </import-export/>`

     - Use a :abbr:`GUI (Graphical User Interface)` to load data
       from a ``JSON`` or a ``CSV`` file into an |service| cluster.

   * - `Relational Migrator <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/relational-migrator/>`__ 
    
     - Use this free tool to migrate from legacy relational databases to MongoDB. 
       Relational Migrator utilizes intelligent algorithms and generative AI 
       to automate solutions to common data modeling, code conversion, and other migration challenges.

You can also restore from an |service| cluster backup data to another
|service| cluster. For information, see :ref:`restore-overview`.
