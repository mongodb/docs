What happens when I reach my Atlas storage limit?
-------------------------------------------------

The result of reaching your |service| storage limit depends on the
|service| cluster you are using.

- For ``M0`` and {+Flex-clusters+}, the maximum storage is
  a hard limit and cannot be exceeded. You can add additional storage
  by upgrading to a dedicated cluster (``M10+``). For details on how
  |service| calculates storage limits for {+Flex-clusters+}, see
  :ref:`this section <faq-caluculate-flex-storage-limit>` of the FAQ.

- By default, ``M10+`` clusters
  :ref:`auto-expand storage <scale-cluster-storage>` based on disk
  usage thresholds. To modify this setting to a fixed storage limit,
  refer to the :ref:`Modify a Cluster <scale-cluster-storage>` page.

If you attempt to write to a {+Flex-cluster+} that does not have space
for the desired write operation, |service| displays an error message
similar to the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   WriteResult({
     "writeError": {
       "code": 8000,
       "errmsg": "you are over your space quota, using 513 MB of 512 MB"
     }
   })

.. seealso::

   To learn about the differences between {+Flex-clusters+} and dedicated
   clusters, see 
   :ref:`{+Atlas-Flex+} Limits <atlas-flex-limitations>`.

.. tip::

   You can configure alerts which trigger once your allocated storage
   reaches a specified threshold. |service| calculates allocated
   storage using metrics returned by the
   :dbcommand:`dbStats` command.

   To learn more about storage alerts, see
   :ref:`DB Storage alert conditions <db-storage-alerts>`.

How does Atlas calculate storage limits for {+Flex-Clusters+}?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| calculates the storage limit for {+Flex-clusters+} based on
data usage, as opposed to the ``storageSize`` metric used by
non-{+Flex-clusters+} (which includes compression). |service| determines
data usage by summing a cluster's ``dataSize`` and ``indexSize``.  You
can issue the :manual:`db.stats() </reference/method/db.stats/>`
method to view the values of these fields.

Without using Provisioned IOPS on MongoDB Atlas on AWS, what kind of IOPS should I expect?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|service| provides an estimate of how many 16K |iops| you can expect,
calculated as the lesser of 3 |iops| per provisioned GB, or the cluster
node's maximum |iops| capacity.

Can I configure a {+cluster+} with more storage than the standard limit for the {+cluster+} tier?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For {+clusters+} that meet specific criteria, yes. To learn which {+clusters+} support extended 
storage and how to enable this for your projects, see :ref:`project-settings`.

How can I reduce storage usage on a cluster?
--------------------------------------------

You can use the ``autoCompact`` command to perform background compaction,
which reduces your storage use. This command automatically iterates through available files
and continuously attempts to release unneeded disk space to the operating
system. To learn more about enabling the ``autoCompact`` privilege action, see
:ref:`atlas-specific-privileges` in the Built-In Roles and Privileges guide.

To run ``autoCompact`` on a cluster, do the following steps:

1. Create a database user and configure the ``autoCompact`` privilege.
#. (*Optional*) If you are connecting to a sharded cluster, retrieve the connection
   string of each node in the sharded cluster. You can use an
   :oas-atlas-op:`{+atlas-admin-api+} endpoint </getCluster>` to retrieve this information.
#. Connect to each node that you want to run ``autoCompact`` on.
#. Run ``autoCompact`` on the ``admin`` database.
