You can integrate {+avs+} with Microsoft `Semantic Kernel 
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/>`__
to build AI applications and implement 
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This tutorial demonstrates
how to start using {+avs+} with Semantic Kernel to perform
semantic search on your data and build a |rag| implementation.
Specifically, you perform the following actions:

#. Set up the environment.
#. Store custom data in MongoDB.
#. Create an {+avs+} index on your data.
#. Run a semantic search query on your data.
#. Implement RAG by using {+avs+} to answer questions on your data.
