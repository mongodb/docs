====================

.. note:: Alternative Installation Methods

   The following guide shows you how to install {+driver-short+} by using
   `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`__. To install 
   {+driver-short+} from source, see `Install from Source <https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#installing-from-source>`__
   in the API Documentation.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Install Dependencies

      Ensure you have the following dependencies installed
      in your development environment:
      
      - `Python3 version 3.8 or later <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__
      - `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`__
      - `dnspython <https://pypi.org/project/dnspython/>`__

   .. step:: Create a Project Directory

      In your shell, run the following command to create a 
      directory called ``pymongo-quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir pymongo-quickstart

      Select the tab corresponding to your operating system and run the following commands
      to create a ``quickstart.py`` application file in the ``pymongo-quickstart`` directory:

      .. tabs::

          .. tab:: macOS / Linux
             :tabid: create-file-mac-linux

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd pymongo-quickstart
                touch quickstart.py

          .. tab:: Windows
             :tabid: create-file-windows

             .. code-block:: bash

                cd pymongo-quickstart
                type nul > quickstart.py

   .. step:: Install {+driver-short+}

      Select the tab corresponding to your operating system and run the following commands
      to create and activate a virtual environment in which to install the driver:

      .. tabs::

          .. tab:: macOS / Linux
             :tabid: venv-mac-linux

             .. code-block:: bash

                python3 -m venv venv
                source venv/bin/activate

          .. tab:: Windows
             :tabid: venv-windows

             .. code-block:: bash

                python3 -m venv venv
                . venv\Scripts\activate
      
      With the virtual environment activated, run the following command to
      install the current version of {+driver-short+}:
      
      .. code-block:: bash

         python3 -m pip install pymongo

After you complete these steps, you have a new project directory
and the driver dependencies installed.
