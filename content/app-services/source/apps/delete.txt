   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

            .. include:: /includes/cli-login.rst

         .. step:: Run the App Delete Command

            The CLI can delete one or more apps with the following command:

            .. code-block:: shell

               {+cli-bin+} apps delete

            If you have more than one App, you will be prompted to select one or
            more apps that you would like to delete from a list of all your Apps.

            If you already know the name or id of the app you would like
            to delete, you can specify it with the ``--app`` flag:

            .. code-block:: shell

               {+cli-bin+} apps delete --app <App ID | App Name>

            .. seealso::

               For more details and additional flags, see the
               CLI documentation for the :ref:`app delete <appservices-apps-delete>` command.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User

            .. include:: /includes/api-authenticate-instructions.rst

         .. step:: Delete the App

            Send a request to the :admin-api-endpoint:`Delete an App
            <operation/adminDeleteApplication>` endpoint.

            Make sure to include your Admin API ``access_token``, the
            ``groupId`` of the Atlas project containing your App, and
            the App's internal ``appId`` hex string:

            .. code-block:: shell

               curl --request DELETE 'https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}' \
                 --header 'Authorization:  Bearer <access_token>' \
                 --header 'Content-Type: application/json'

            If your application deletes successfully, App Services returns a ``204`` response.
