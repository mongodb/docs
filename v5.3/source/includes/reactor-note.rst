.. important:: Project Reactor Library

   This guide uses the {+pr+} library to consume ``Publisher`` instances returned
   by the {+driver-short+} methods. To learn more about the {+pr+} library
   and how to use it, see `Getting Started <https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#getting-started>`__
   in the Reactor documentation. To learn more about how we use {+pr+}
   library methods in this guide, see the :ref:`Write Data to MongoDB
   <write-data-reactor-overview>` guide.
