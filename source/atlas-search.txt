MongoDB's |fts| feature offers fine-grained text indexing to
enable advanced search functionality without any additional management
required. |fts| provides options for several kinds of :ref:`text
analyzers <analyzers-ref>`, score-based results ranking, and a rich
:ref:`query language <query-syntax-ref>`. 

Getting Started
---------------

To get started creating and querying an |fts| index, see the
:ref:`Atlas Search Tutorial <fts-tutorial-ref>`. 

Find out more about:

:ref:`Analyzers <analyzers-ref>`
  Analyzers control the way your |fts| index is constructed. You
  can select an analyzer to customize your index to make the best use
  of a particular language's vocabulary and grammar, or to create an
  index which is language-neutral.

:ref:`Atlas Search Indexes <ref-index-management>`
  Learn how to :ref:`create <ref-create-index>`,
  :ref:`edit <ref-edit-index>`, and :ref:`delete <ref-delete-index>`
  |fts| indexes.

  You can customize your index definition to take advantage of
  :ref:`static and dynamic <static-dynamic-mappings>` field mappings.

:ref:`Atlas Search Queries and Results <searching-ref>`
  Construct |fts| queries with the :ref:`$search <query-syntax-ref>`
  :manual:`aggregation pipeline </aggregation>` stage. Find reference
  pages for the ``$search`` operators with examples here.

  Learn how |fts| :ref:`ranks query results <scoring-ref>`, how to 
  :ref:`return highlighted search results <highlight-ref>`, and how to
  return :ref:`detailed query plan and execution statistics 
  <explain-ref>` for your queries.

:ref:`Performance Considerations <perf-ref>`
  Information about how |fts| affects database performance and how
  to monitor resource usage.

:ref:`Atlas Search Free and Shared Tier Limitations <atlas-fts-shared-tier-limitations>` 
  Information about the |fts| limitations on ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5`` 
  {+shared-clusters+}.
