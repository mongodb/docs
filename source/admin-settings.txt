Monthly Data Transfer
---------------------

The :guilabel:`Data Tranfer by Month` panel of the
:guilabel:`Data Transfer` page shows the data usage of your |charts| 
instance over the current month.

The panel displays the following metrics:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Metric
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Total Data Transfer`
     - Total data usage in ``GB`` that your |charts-short| instance has
       consumed over the current month.

   * - :guilabel:`Free Tier Remaining`
     - Amount of data in ``GB`` that your |charts-short| instance can
       still use this month for free. If you exceed this amount, your
       |charts-short| instance starts
       :ref:`incurring charges <charts-billing>`.

   * - :guilabel:`Days Remaining`
     - Days remaining in the current month, after which the usage cycle
       resets.

MongoDB provides a free ``1 GB`` of data transfers per month. Nearly
all |charts-short| use cases should fall within this ``1 GB`` free
tier. For more information on |charts| pricing and sample pricing
scenarios, see :ref:`charts-billing`.
