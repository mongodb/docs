msgid "In general, the performance gains that indexes provide for *read operations* are worth the insertion penalty. However, in order to optimize write performance when possible, be careful when creating new indexes and evaluate the existing indexes to ensure that your queries actually use these indexes."

msgid "If an update operation causes a document to exceed the currently allocated :term:`record size`, MongoDB relocates the document on disk with enough contiguous space to hold the document. These relocations take longer than in-place updates, particularly if the collection has indexes. If a collection has indexes, MongoDB must update all index entries. Thus, for a collection with many indexes, the move will impact the write throughput."

msgid "Some update operations, such as the :update:`$inc` operation, do not cause an increase in document size. For these update operations, MongoDB can apply the updates in-place. Other update operations, such as the :update:`$push` operation, change the size of the document."

Decreasing the period between journal commits will increase the number of write operations, which can limit MongoDB's capacity for write operations. Increasing the amount of time between commits may decrease the total number of write operation, but also increases the chance that the journal will not record a write operation in the event of a failure."
