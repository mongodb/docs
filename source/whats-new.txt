.. _kafka-connector-whats-new-1.13.1:

What's New in 1.13.1
--------------------
- Fixed a bug where data copies itself again when a task restarts.
  To learn more about this fix, see the 
  `KAFKA-428 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/KAFKA-428>`__ JIRA issue.

.. _kafka-connector-whats-new-1.13:

What's New in 1.13
------------------

- Added a custom authentication provider interface for Source and Sink
  Connectors. This feature enables you to write and use a custom implementation
  class in your connector. To learn more, see the :ref:`kafka-custom-auth` guide.

- Fixed an issue that occurred when validating configuration for Source
  and Sink Connectors if the configuration contained secrets and used
  the ``Provider`` framework. To learn more about this fix, see the
  `KAFKA-414 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/KAFKA-414>`__ JIRA issue.

.. _kafka-connector-whats-new-1.12:

What's New in 1.12
------------------

- Added support for a ``data`` configuration value in the ``mongo.errors.tolerance``
  configuration setting. With ``mongo.errors.tolerance=data``, the sink
  connector tolerates only data errors, and fails for any others.
