MongoDB |service| supports private endpoints on {+dedicated-clusters+}. Select 
your {+database-deployment+} type to learn which cloud providers |service| supports:

- |aws| using the `{+aws-pl+} <https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/>`__ feature.

- |azure| using the `{+az-pl+} <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/private-link/>`__
  feature.

- |gcp| using the `{+gcp-psc+} <https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect>`__
  feature.

You can also set up private endpoints for your Online Archive. To 
learn more, see :ref:`oa-config-private-endpoint`.

      :tabid: {+aws-pl+}

      When you enable PrivateLink in |aws| and private
      endpoints in |service|, |aws| and |service| create the following 
      resources to support secure connections over |vpc|\s:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Private endpoint service
           - |service|
           - A collection of private endpoint resources within
             your |service| |vpc| that places {+database-deployments+} within a region behind a network load balancer. |aws| refers to the endpoint
             service as the :guilabel:`VPC endpoint service`.

         * - Interface endpoint
           - |aws|
           - |aws| |vpc| endpoint with a private IP address
             that sends traffic to the private endpoint service over |aws| PrivateLink. |aws| refers to the 
             interface endpoint as the :guilabel:`VPC endpoint`.

           - |aws| and |service| together
           - A generic term for the private
             connection established
             between |service| and your cloud provider. For 
             |aws|, that connection is established using PrivateLink.

      When you enable this feature, |azure| and |service| create
      the following resources to support secure connections over 
      VNets:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Private endpoint service
           - |service|
           - A collection of private endpoint resources within
             your |service| VNet that places
             {+database-deployments+} within a region behind a
             network load balancer.

         * - Private endpoint
           - |azure| and |service| together

             |azure|, that connection is established using Private Link.
               
      |service| creates a Private 
      Link service and places clusters within a region behind a 
      load balancer in the |service| VNet.

      Then you create resources that establish a one-way 
      connection from your VNet to the :azure:`Private Link 
      service </private-link/private-link-service-overview>` in 
      the |service| VNet using a private endpoint. The Private 
      Link service routes traffic to the load balancer that 
      fronts the clusters in the |service| VNet.

   .. tab:: {+gcp-psc+}
      :tabid: {+gcp-psc+}

      When you enable this feature, |gcp| and |service| create
      the following resources to support secure connections over 
      |vpc|\s:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 20 40 40

         * - Private endpoint service
           - |service|
           - A collection of private endpoint resources within
             your |service| |vpc| that places
             {+database-deployments+} within a region behind
             network load balancers.

         * - Private endpoints
           - |gcp| and |service| together
           - A generic term for the private
             connections established
             between |service| and your cloud provider. For 
             |gcp|, those connections are established using
             Private Service Connect.

      When you enable {+gcp-psc+} in |gcp|, |service|
      creates a private endpoint service using :gcp:`service attachments 
      </vpc/docs/private-service-connect#service-attachments>`
      and load balancers.

      Next, you create resources that establish a one-way 
      connection from your |vpc| to the private endpoint service 
      in |service| using a private endpoint. The private endpoint 
      service routes traffic to the load balancers for the 
      {+clusters+} in the |service| |vpc|.

      To ensure the availability of resources for both current 
      and future {+clusters+}, |service| performs the following 
      actions when you enable this feature:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: One Cluster, One Region

            The following diagram shows how {+gcp-psc+}
            establishes connections when you have one {+cluster+}
            in one region.

            .. figure:: /images/google-psc-diagram.svg

                     connections from your application VPC to
                     resources in the |service| VPC when you have
                     one cluster in one region. Lighter colored
                     lines represent potential connections to
                     addresses that |service| reserves.

            The following diagram shows how {+gcp-psc+}
            establishes connections when you have two 
            {+clusters+} in one region.

                     connections from your application VPC to
                     resources in the |service| VPC when you have
                     two clusters in one region. Lighter colored
                     lines represent potential connections to
                     addresses that |service| reserves.

            :tabid: gcp-psc-one-cluster-multiple-regions

            The following diagram shows how {+gcp-psc+}
            establishes connections when you have one {+cluster+}
            in multiple regions.

                     one cluster in multiple regions. Lighter colored
                     lines represent potential connections to
                     addresses that |service| reserves.
         

      Connections to |service| clusters using private endpoints 
      offer the following advantages over other network access 
      management options:

      - Connections to private endpoints are one-way. |service| 
         |vpc|\s can't initiate connections back to your |gcp| 
         |vpc|\s. This ensures your perceived network trust 
         boundary is not extended. 
      - You can connect to private endpoints within your |vpc| 
         transitively from an on-premises data center connected 
         with Google Cloud VPN to the private endpoint-connected 
         |vpc|. This enables you to connect to |service| directly 
         from your on-premises data center without adding public IP
         addresses to the |service| access list.

You can also set up private endpoints for your Online Archive. To 
learn more, see :ref:`oa-config-private-endpoint`.

Required Access
---------------

To set up a private endpoint, you must have
:authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner` access to
the project.

Considerations

High Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      :tabid: {+gcp-psc+}

      You don't need to take additional actions to ensure that 
      |gcp| private endpoint connections to |service| can 
      withstand an availability zone outage.

      Multi-Region Support
      ````````````````````
      
      {+gcp-psc+} now provides multi-region support for your 
      |service| {+database-deployments+}. You can configure :gcp:`global access 
      </vpc/docs/about-accessing-vpc-hosted-services-endpoints#global-access>`
      to connect to private endpoints from a different |gcp| region. 
      By using global access, you can ensure high availability for 
      your multi-region {+database-deployments+}, single-region deployments 
      hosted in a different region than your own, and |gcp| nodes in your 
      multi-cloud deployments. 
      
      To learn more, see 
      `Introducing PSC Interconnect and Global Access for MongoDB Atlas 
      <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/psc-interconnect-and-global-access/>`__.

   .. tab:: {+aws-pl+}
      :tabid: {+aws-pl+}

      Max Incoming Connections
      `````````````````````````

      |service| sets the :setting:`limits for concurrent incoming connections
      <net.maxIncomingConnections>` based on the {+cluster+} tier and
      :ref:`class<storage-class-ui>`. |service| connection limits apply per node. For
      :manual:`sharded {+clusters+} </sharding/>`, |service| connection limits apply per
      :manual:`mongos </core/sharded-cluster-query-router/>` router. The number of
      :manual:`mongos </core/sharded-cluster-query-router/>` routers is equal to
      the number of replica set nodes across all shards. 

      Your :manual:`read preference </core/read-preference/>` also contributes to the
      total number of connections |service| can allocate for a given query.

      .. example::
        Your ``M10`` cluster has three nodes with a 1500 connection limit per node.
        |service| reserves 10 connections per node. If you set your :manual:`read preference
        </core/read-preference/>` to :manual:`secondary
        </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-secondary>`, |service| can read from
        the two secondary nodes for a combined 2980 connection limit.

      To learn more about connection limits and increasing your limits, see :ref:`connection-limits`.

   .. tab:: {+gcp-psc+}
      :tabid: {+gcp-psc+}

      |service| services are accessed through 
      {+gcp-psc+} endpoints on ports 27015 through 27017. The 
      ports can change under specific circumstances, including 
      (but not limited to) cluster changes.

      .. important::
         MongoDB strongly recommends using the DNS seedlist 
         private endpoint-aware connection string, so that DNS 
         automatically updates the ports that {+gcp-psc+} uses if
         they change. For the same reason, MongoDB also strongly 
         recommends allow-listing the entire port range, instead
         of specific ports.

(Optional) Optimize Connection to Sharded {+Clusters+} Behind a Private Endpoint 
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-optimized-connection-strings-intro.rst

|service| doesn't support optimized connection strings for 
{+clusters+} that run on |gcp| or |azure|. To learn more about optimized 
connection strings for sharded {+clusters+} behind a private 
endpoint, see :ref:`optimized-connection-strings`. 

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Connect to Atlas using a Private Endpoint <connect-private-endpoint>`

.. _private-endpoint-access-lists:

IP Access Lists and Network Peering Connections with Private Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you enable private endpoints, you can still enable access to 
your |service| {+database-deployments+} using other methods, such 
as adding public IPs to :doc:`IP access lists 
</security/ip-access-list>` and :doc:`network peering 
</security-vpc-peering>`.

Clients connecting to |service| {+database-deployments+} using 
other methods use standard connection strings. Your clients might 
have to identify when to use private endpoint-aware connection 
strings and standard connection strings.

Multi-Cloud Deployment Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you use a private endpoint to connect to a multi-cloud deployment,
you can access only the nodes hosted in the cloud service provider and region
that you're connecting from. To access all nodes in your multi-cloud deployment,
use alternative connection methods described in the :ref:`Connections to Multi-Cloud Deployments
<multi-cloud-limitation>` section in the "Configure High Availability and Workload Isolation"
topic.

.. _atlas_regionalized-pl:

(Optional) Regionalized Private Endpoints for Multi-Region Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For global sharded clusters that you deploy in multiple regions, if you need
to connect to |service| using a private endpoint from networks that can't
be peered with one another, you can deploy multiple private endpoints to a region.

You can deploy any number of private endpoints to regions that you
deployed your {+database-deployment+} to. Each regional private
endpoint connects to the |mongos| instances in that region.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/warnings/regionalized-pls-change-connection-strings.rst

.. include:: /includes/enable-regionalized-privatelink.rst

To use this feature, you must enable the regionalized private 
endpoint setting.

To enable or disable the regionalized private endpoint setting:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli 

      Enable Regionalized Private Endpoints
      `````````````````````````````````````

Connecting to Multi-Region {+Clusters+} Without Regionalized Private Endpoints 
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If you use {+aws-pl+} and have applications that connect to multi-region {+clusters+}
that have endpoints in different regions but are not using :ref:`regionalized private endpoints
<atlas_regionalized-pl>`, ensure that those applications can reach endpoints 
in the other regions. For example, to do this with |aws|, 
you can :ref:`peer <vpc-peering>` the |vpc|\s that 
contain the endpoints on their side.

.. _atlas-pl-limitations:

Limitations
-----------

- ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and {+Flex-clusters+} do  **not**  support connecting through a
  private endpoint. 

.. tabs::

         .. tab:: {+aws-pl+}
            :tabid: {+aws-pl+}

            - {+aws-pl+} must be active in all regions into which you 
              deploy a multi-region {+cluster+}. You will receive an 
              error if {+aws-pl+} is active in some, but not all, 
              targeted regions. If you have a multi-cloud {+cluster+} 
              in |aws| or |azure|, you must provision an endpoint in 
              each provider or region and set up site-to-site VPN.

            - You can do only one of the following:

              - Deploy nodes in more than one region, and have one
                private endpoint per region.
              - Have multiple private endpoints in one region, and no
                other private endpoints. 

                .. important::

                   This limitation applies across cloud providers. For
                   example, if you create more than one private endpoint
                   in a single region in |aws|, you can't create
                   private endpoints in |azure| or any other |aws|
                   region.

                See :ref:`atlas_regionalized-pl` for an exception for
                multi-region and global sharded clusters.

            .. include:: /includes/fact-private-endpoint-limits-aws.rst

            - You can use {+aws-pl+} in |service| projects with up to 50
              addressable targets **per region**. If you need more than 
              50 addressable targets in a region:

              - Contact :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>`, or 
              - Use additional projects or regions to connect to 
                addressable targets beyond this limit.
            
              Addressable targets include:

              - Each |mongod| instance in a replica set deployment 
                (sharded clusters excluded).
              - Each sharded cluster deployment that use

            - {+az-pl+} must be active in all regions into which you 
              deploy a multi-region cluster. You will receive an error 
              if {+az-pl+} is active in some, but not all, targeted 
              regions. If you have a multi-cloud cluster in |aws| or 
              |azure|, you must provision an 
              endpoint in each provider or region and set up 
              site-to-site VPN.

            - You can do only one of the following:

              - Deploy nodes in more than one region, and have one
                private endpoint per region.
              - Have multiple private endpoints in one region, and no
                other private endpoints. 

                .. important::

                   This limitation applies across cloud providers. For
                   example, if you create more than one private endpoint
                   in a single region in |azure|, you can't create
                   private endpoints in |aws| or any other |azure|
                   region.

              See :ref:`atlas_regionalized-pl` for an exception for
              multi-region and global sharded clusters.

            - To connect to |service| clusters using {+az-pl+} from 
              regions in which you haven't deployed a private endpoint 
              connection, you must peer VNets in those regions to VNets 
              in a region in which you have deployed a private endpoint 
              connection.

              To learn about Global VNet peering, see the
              :azure:`Azure documentation </virtual-network/virtual-networks-faq#can-i-create-a-peering-connection-to-a-vnet-in-a-different-region>`.

            - You can use {+az-pl+} in |service| projects with up to 150
              addressable targets **per region**. If you need more than 
              150 addressable targets in a region:

              - Contact :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>`, or 
              - Use additional projects or regions to connect to 
                addressable targets beyond this limit.

              Addressable targets include:

              - Each |mongod| instance in a replica set deployment 
                (sharded clusters excluded).
              - Each |mongos| instance in a sharded cluster deployment.
              - Each |bic| instance across all dedicated clusters in the
                project.

            - {+az-pl+} does not allow more than 64k |tcp| connections
              per target, which might be lower than the maximum number of
              connections that a {+cluster+} can sustain.

                   example, if you create more than one private endpoint
                   in a single region in |gcp|, you can't create
                   private endpoints in |aws| or any other |gcp|
                   region.

            - |service| creates 50 service attachments, each with a
              subnet mask value of 27. You can change the number of
              service attachments and the subnet masks that |service|
              creates by setting the following limits with the 
              :oas-atlas-op:`Set One Project Limit </setProjectLimit>` 
              {+atlas-admin-api+} endpoint:

              - Set the 
                ``atlas.project.deployment.privateServiceConnectionsPerRegionGroup`` limit to
                change the number of service attachments.
              - Set the ``atlas.project.deployment.privateServiceConnectionsSubnetMask``
                limit to change the subnet mask for each service
                attachment.

              To learn more, see :oas-atlas-op:`Set One Project Limit 
              </setProjectLimit>`.

            - You can have up to 50 nodes when you create |service| projects 
              that use {+gcp-psc+} in a **single region**. If you need
              to change the number of nodes, perform one of the
              following actions:

              - Remove existing private endpoints and then
                change the limit using the :oas-atlas-op:`Set One
                Project Limit </setProjectLimit>` {+atlas-admin-api+}
                endpoint.
              - Contact :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>`.
              - Use additional projects or regions to connect to nodes 
                beyond this limit.

            - Each private endpoint in |gcp| reserves an IP address 
              within your |gcp| |vpc| and forwards traffic from the 
              endpoints' IP addresses to the 
              :gcp:`service attachments </vpc/docs/private-service-connect#service-attachments>`.
              You must create an equal number of private endpoints 
              to the number of service attachments. The number of 
              service attachments defaults to 50.

              Addressable targets include:

              - Each |mongod| instance in a replica set deployment 
                (sharded clusters excluded).
              - Each |mongos| instance in a sharded cluster deployment.
              - Each |bic| instance across all dedicated clusters in the
                project.

            - If you configure dedicated :ref:`Search Nodes <configure-search-nodes>` 
              for ``M10+`` {+clusters+} in any |gcp| region, |service| doesn't count 
              these nodes in the total count of addressable targets.
            
            - To request a one-time increase to use {+gcp-psc+} with up to 100 nodes per 
              |service| project, contact :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>`.

            - You can have up to 40 nodes when you create |service| projects 
              that use {+gcp-psc+} across **multiple regions**. This total 
              excludes the following instances:

              - |gcp| regions communicating with each other
              - {+Free-clusters+} or {+Flex-clusters+}
           
            - |gcp| {+google-psc+} supports up to 1024 outgoing 
              connections per virtual machine. As a result, you can't 
              have more than 1024 connections from a single |gcp| 
              virtual machine to an |service| cluster.

              To learn more, see the |gcp|
              :gcp:`cloud NAT documentation 
              </nat/docs/ports-and-addresses>`.

            - |gcp| {+google-psc+} is region-specific. However, you
              can configure :gcp:`global access 
              </vpc/docs/about-accessing-vpc-hosted-services-endpoints#global-access>`
              to access private endpoints from a different region.
              
              To learn more, see :ref:`Multi-Region Support <private-endpoint-ha>`.

              .. note:: 

                 You can't use |vpc| peering to access private endpoints 
                 from a different region. 

            -  When you use {+google-psc+} to connect to multi-region
               {+clusters+}, you can connect only to {+cluster+} nodes 
               that are in the same region as the private endpoint. If 
               the endpoint and the primary node are in different 
               regions, you must:

               1. Set your application's
                  :manual:`read preference </core/read-preference/>`
                  to allow connections from a secondary node.

                  For example, you can set your application's read 
                  preference to :manual:`secondaryPreferred </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-secondaryPreferred>`.

               2. Ensure at least one secondary node is in the same 
                  region as the endpoint.

      - Before you can deploy a private endpoint to a region, 
        you must first resume any paused {+database-deployments+} 
        in your project with nodes deployed to that region.

            - Have either the :authrole:`Project Owner` or
              :authrole:`Organization Owner` role in |service|. 

            - Have a |gcp| user account with an |iam| user policy and a
              :gcp:`Compute Network Admin </iam/docs/understanding-roles#compute.networkAdmin>`
              role that grants permissions to create, modify, and delete

            - :gcp:`Install gcloud CLI </sdk/docs/install>`.

            - If you have not already done so, create your |vpc| and
              Compute instances in |gcp|. See the :gcp:`GCP
              documentation </vpc/docs/using-vpc.html>` for guidance. 

            - Make sure egress firewall rules permit traffic to the
              internal IP address of the {+gcp-psc+} endpoint. 
         
            - (Optional) If you enforce a security perimeter with |vpc|
              service controls (VPC-SC), you must create ingress and
              egress rules to establish the connection between the
              {+gcp-psc+} endpoint and |service| {+clusters+}. See the
              :gcp:`GCP documentation
