Overview
--------

On this page, you can learn how to upgrade your driver to a new version. This page also 
includes the changes you must make to your application to upgrade your driver 
without losing functionality, if applicable.

How to Upgrade
--------------

Before you upgrade, perform the following actions:

- Ensure the new driver version is compatible with the {+mdb-server+} version
  your application connects to and the version of Node.js that your
  application runs on. See the :ref:`<node-compatibility>`
  page for this information.
- Address any breaking changes between the version of the driver
  your application uses now and your planned upgrade version in the
  :ref:`<node-breaking-changes>` section of this guide. To learn
  more about the {+mdb-server+} release compatibility changes, see the 
  :ref:`<node-server-support-changes>` section.

.. tip::

   You can minimize the amount of changes that you must make to your
   application when upgrading driver versions by using the
   :ref:`{+stable-api+} <nodejs-stable-api>`.

To upgrade your driver version, run the following command in your application's 
directory:

.. code-block:: bash
   
    npm install mongodb@{+version+}

To upgrade to a different version of the driver, replace the information after the
``@`` symbol with your preferred version number. For more information about the
``npm install`` command, see the `npm-install <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-install?v=true>`__ 
npm documentation.

Breaking Changes
----------------

A breaking change is a modification in a convention or behavior in
a specific version of the driver that may prevent your application from
working as expected.

The breaking changes in this section are categorized by the major
version releases that introduced them. When upgrading driver versions,
address all the breaking changes between your current version and the
planned upgrade version. For example, if you are upgrading the driver
from v3.x to v5.x, address all breaking changes listed under v4.0 and
v5.0.

.. _node-breaking-changes-v6.x:
.. _node-breaking-changes-v6.0:

Version 6.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Version 6.0 of the {+driver-short+} requires Node.js v16.20.1 or later.
- The driver removes support for the ``addUser()`` helper command. Use the
  :manual:`createUser </reference/command/createUser>` MongoDB Shell command instead.
- The driver removes support for the ``collStats`` operation. Use the
  :manual:`$collStats </reference/operator/aggregation/collStats>` aggregation operator
  instead.
- The driver removes all the deprecated ``ssl``-prefixed options and the
  ``tlsCertificateFile`` option in the ``MongoClientOptions`` type.
  Create a ``SecureContext`` object or set the ``tls``-prefixed options
  in your ``MongoClientOptions`` instance instead.
- The driver reads files set in the ``tlsCAFile`` and
  ``tlsCertificateKeyFile`` connection options when you call the
  ``MongoClient.connect()`` method, not when you create the
  ``MongoClient`` instance.
- The driver removes the ``keepAlive`` and ``keepAliveInitialDelay`` connection
  options. The value of ``keepAlive`` is permanently set to ``true`` and the
  value of ``keepAliveInitialDelay`` is set to 300000 milliseconds (300
  seconds).
- The ``Db.command()`` method accepts only options that are not related
  to a specific command. To learn more about these options, see the  
  :ref:`Command Options <node-command-options>` section of the Run a
  Command guide.
- If you add ``mongodb-client-encryption`` as a dependency,
  the major version number must match that of the {+driver-short+}. For example,
  {+driver-short+} v6.x.x requires ``mongodb-client-encryption`` v6.x.x.
- Automatic Encryption methods are now in the {+driver-short+}. You must
  import these methods from the driver instead of from
  ``mongodb-client-encryption``.
- Removed the ``ObjectId`` constructor that accepted a 12-character string.
- Modified ``abortTransaction()`` and ``commitTransaction()`` methods to return
  ``null`` instead of the raw command results.
- Removed connection option helpers that accepted values other than ``true``
  or  ``false`` as booleans. You must provide either ``true`` or ``false`` values in
  the connection string or to the MongoClient constructor.
- Removed the ``Binary`` BSON type constructor that accepted a string.
- The ``Binary.write()`` method no longer accepts a string to write to the binary
  BSON object.
- The ClientEncryption API returns promises instead of callbacks.
- The ``socks`` package, which enables SOCKS5 proxy support, is a
  peer-optional dependency. You must install the package to enable
  SOCKS5 in your application. To learn more, see :ref:`node-connect-socks`.
- If you start a session on a client, then pass that session to a
  different client, the driver throws an error when you
  perform any operations in the session.
- The ``includeResultMetadata`` option for compound operation methods is
  ``false`` by default. See the :ref:`Built-in Methods <node-compound-operations-builtin>` 
  section of the Compound Operations guide for more information.
- The ``withSession()`` method returns the value that the provided
  function returns. In previous driver versions, this method returns
  ``undefined``. The ``withTransaction()`` method returns the value that the
  callback returns. In previous driver versions, this method
  returns the server command response, which varies depending on the MongoDB
  Server version or type that the driver connects to. To learn more
  about transactions, see the :ref:`node-usage-txns` usage
  examples and the :ref:`nodejs-transactions` guide.
- Raised the optional ``kerberos`` dependency minimum version to 2.0.1 and
  removed support for version 1.x.
- Raised the optional ``zstd`` dependency minimum version to 1.1.0.

.. _node-breaking-changes-v5.x:
.. _node-breaking-changes-v5.0:

Version 5.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The driver is no longer compatible with Node.js v12 or earlier. If you want to use
  this version of the driver, you must use Node.js v14.20.1 or greater.

- The driver removes support for callbacks in favor of a promise-based API.
  The following list provides some strategies for callback users to adopt this
  version:

  - Migrate to the promise-based API (recommended)
  - Use the promise-based API and ``util.callbackify``
  - Add ``mongodb-legacy`` to continue using callbacks

  For more information about these strategies, see
  `the v5.0 changelog <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/main/etc/notes/CHANGES_5.0.0.md#optional-callback-support-migrated-to-mongodb-legacy>`__.

- The driver removes support for the ``Collection.insert()``,
  ``Collection.update()``, and ``Collection.remove()`` helper methods.
  The following list provides instructions on how to replace the
  functionality of the removed methods:

  - Migrate from ``Collection.insert()`` to ``insertOne()`` or ``insertMany()``
  - Migrate from ``Collection.update()`` to ``updateOne()`` or ``updateMany()``
  - Migrate from ``Collection.remove()`` to ``deleteOne()`` or ``deleteMany()``

- The driver no longer includes AWS SDK modules by default.

- The driver no longer automatically imports the ``bson-ext`` package.

- The driver removes support for custom ``Promise`` libraries. The driver no
  longer supports the ``promiseLibrary`` option of ``MongoClient`` and the ``Promise.set``
  export that allows specifying a custom ``Promise`` library.

- The driver removes support for the ``Collection.mapReduce()`` helper.

- The ``BulkWriteResult`` type no longer has the publicly enumerable
  ``result`` property.

- The following types, options, and methods have been removed:

  - ``BulkResult.lastOp()`` method
  - ``opTime`` property of ``BulkResult``
  - ``BulkWriteOptions.keepGoing`` option
  - ``WriteConcernError.err()`` method
  - ``AddUserOptions.digestPassword`` option
  - Kerberos ``gssapiCanonicalizeHostName`` option
  - ``slaveOk`` options and method removed in favor of ``secondaryOk``
  - ``ObjectID`` type removed in favor of ``ObjectId``
  - ``AsyncIterator`` interface removed in favor of ``AsyncGenerator``

.. _node-breaking-changes-v4.x:
.. _node-breaking-changes-v4.0:

Version 4.0 Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The driver is no longer compatible with Node.js v12.8 or earlier. If you
  want to use this version of the driver, you must use Node.js v12.9 or greater.

- ``Cursor`` types no longer extend ``Readable`` directly.

- You cannot use a ``ChangeStream`` instance as an iterator after using
  it as an ``EventEmitter``. You also cannot do the reverse—using an
  ``EventEmitter`` instance as an iterator after using it as a ``ChangeStream``.

- The following methods no longer accept a callback parameter:

  - ``Collection.find()``
  - ``Collection.aggregate()``
  - ``Db.aggregate()``

- The default value of the ``maxPoolSize`` connection option is now
  ``100``.

- The driver no longer supports the ``gssapiServiceName`` Kerberos
  option. Use ``authMechanismProperties.SERVICE_NAME`` instead.

- The driver no longer accepts non-boolean types, such as ``0`` or
  ``1``, for boolean options.

- The ``db.collection`` type no longer accepts a callback.

- The ``Db`` type is no longer an ``EventEmitter``. You can listen to
  any events directly from the ``MongoClient`` instance.

- The driver removes support for the ``Collection.group()`` helper.

- The driver no longer includes the deprecated ``GridStore`` API.

For more information about these changes, see
`the v4.0 changelog <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/main/etc/notes/CHANGES_4.0.0.md>`__.

.. _node-server-support-changes:

Server Release Compatibility Changes
------------------------------------

A server release compatibility change is a modification
to the driver that discontinues support for a set of
{+mdb-server+} versions.

The driver discontinues support for a {+mdb-server+} version after it reaches
end-of-life (EOL).

To learn more about the MongoDB support for EOL products,
see the `Legacy Support Policy <https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy/legacy>`__.

Version 4.2 Server Release Support Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The v4.2 driver drops support for {+mdb-server+} v3.4 and earlier.
  To use the v4.2 driver, your {+mdb-server+} must be v3.6 or later. To learn
  how to upgrade your {+mdb-server+} deployment, see :manual:`Release
  Notes </release-notes>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
