   :description: Find support for MongoDB Node.js Driver issues through community forums, report bugs or request features in JIRA, and create pull requests to contribute.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Our developer community is vibrant and highly engaged, with extensive experience using Node.js with MongoDB.

Often, the quickest way to get support for general questions is through the
`MongoDB Community Forums <https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums>`__.

Refer to our :manual:`support channels </support>` documentation for more information.

Bugs / Feature Requests
-----------------------

To report a bug or to request a new feature in the Node.js driver,
please open a case in our issue management tool, JIRA:


* `Create an account and login <https://jira.mongodb.org>`_.
* Navigate to `the NODE project <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE>`_.
* Click **Create Issue**. Please provide as much information as possible about the
  issue and the steps to reproduce it.

Bug reports in JIRA for the Node.js driver and the Core Server (SERVER) project are **public**.

If you’ve identified a security vulnerability in a driver or any other
MongoDB project, please report it according to the instructions found in
the :manual:`Create a Vulnerability Report </tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report>`.

Pull Requests
-------------

We are happy to accept contributions to help improve the driver. We will review user
contributions to ensure they meet the standards of the codebase. Pull requests must pass
the ``travis.ci`` checks, include documentation, and include tests.

To get started check out the source and work on a branch:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native.git
   cd node-mongodb-native
   npm install
   git checkout -b myNewFeature

To run the test suite, you must have a server topology running and provide the URI to the command.
For example, if you have a single server running at ``"mongodb://localhost:27017"``, you can run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017" npm test

Note that the tests run on your feature are different depending on the type of topology
that you are running, such as for a standalone instance or replica set.

.. note::

   There are many tools that can help you with setting up different topologies for local testing.
   Some examples are `mtools <https://pypi.org/project/mtools/>`_ and `mongo-orchestration <https://pypi.org/project/mongo-orchestration/>`_.
