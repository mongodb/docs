"Delayed members contain copies of a :term:`replica set's <replica set>` "
"data set. However, a delayed member's data set reflects an earlier, or "
"delayed, state of the set. For example, if the current time is 09:52 and "
"a member has a delay of an hour, the delayed member has no operation more"
" recent than 08:52."

"Because delayed members are a \"rolling backup\" or a running "
"\"historical\" snapshot of the data set, they may help you recover from "
"various kinds of human error. For example, a delayed member can make it "
"possible to recover from unsuccessful application upgrades and operator "
"errors including dropped databases and collections."
