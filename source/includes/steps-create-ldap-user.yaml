  .. example::

     For the LDAP user named myUser in the project named projectName,
     enter the following:

     ``cn=myUser,ou=projectName,dc=com``

  If you enable LDAP authorization, you can create LDAP users, but they
  can't access your {+clusters+}. Add an LDAP group to access
  {+clusters+} with LDAP authorization enabled.

  a. Toggle :guilabel:`Temporary User` or :guilabel:`Temporary Group`
     to :guilabel:`On`.
  b. Choose a time after which |service| can delete the
     user or group from the :guilabel:`Temporary User Duration` or
     :guilabel:`Temporary Group Duration` dropdown. You can select one
     of the following time periods for the user or group to exist:

     - 6 hours
     - 1 day
     - 1 week

  In the :guilabel:`Database Users` tab, temporary users and groups
  display the time remaining until |service| will delete the user or
  group. Once |service| deletes the user or group, any client or
  application that uses the temporary user's or group's credentials
  loses access to the cluster.
