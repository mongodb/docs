   with the ``--keyFile`` command-line option or the

      If using a configuration file, set

      - :setting:`security.keyFile` to the keyfile's path, and

ref: deploy-repset-connect-to-member
pre: |
  Connect :binary:`~bin.mongosh` to one of the 
  {{program}} instances over the :ref:`localhost
  interface<localhost-exception>`. You must run :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
  on the same physical machine as the {{program}} instance.

  The :ref:`localhost interface<localhost-exception>` is only available
  since no users have been created for the deployment. The
  :ref:`localhost interface<localhost-exception>` closes after the
  creation of the first user.

  :method:`rs.initiate()` triggers an :term:`election` and
  elects one of the members to be the :term:`primary`.

  Connect to the primary before continuing. Use :method:`rs.status()` to
  locate the primary member.

title: Create the user administrator.
level: 4
ref: deploy-repset-user-admin
pre: |

  .. important::

     After you create the first user, the :ref:`localhost exception
     <localhost-exception>` is no longer available.

     The first user must have privileges to create other users, such
     as a user with the :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`. This ensures
     that you can create additional users after the :ref:`localhost-exception`
     closes.

     If at least one user does *not* have privileges to create users,
     once the localhost exception closes you may be unable to create
     or modify users with new privileges, and therefore unable to
     access necessary operations.

  Add a user using the :method:`db.createUser()` method. The user should
  have at minimum the :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role on the
  ``admin`` database.

  You must be connected to the :term:`primary` to create users.

  The following example creates the user ``fred`` with the
  :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role on the ``admin`` database.

  .. important::

     Passwords should be random, long, and complex to ensure system security
     and to prevent or delay malicious access.

        roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]

action:

      administrator ``fred``:

      .. tip::

    language: javascript
    code: |
      db.getSiblingDB("admin").auth("fred", passwordPrompt()) // or cleartext password
  - pre: |
      Alternatively, connect a new :binary:`~bin.mongosh` instance to
      the primary replica set member using the ``-u <username>``,
      ``-p <password>``, and the ``--authenticationDatabase``
      parameters.
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongosh -u "fred" -p  --authenticationDatabase "admin"
    post: |
      If you do not specify the password to the :option:`-p <mongosh -p>`
      command-line option, :binary:`~bin.mongosh` prompts for the
      password.
