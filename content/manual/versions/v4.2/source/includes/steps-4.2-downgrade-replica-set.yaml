  Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the latest
  release in the |oldversion| series. If using a package manager, add a new
  repository for the |oldversion| binaries, then perform the actual downgrade
  process.

title: "Downgrade secondary members of the replica set."
level: 4
ref: downgrade-secondaries
content: |

  Downgrade each :term:`secondary` member of the replica set, one at a
  time:

  a. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod`. See
     :ref:`terminate-mongod-processes` for additional ways to safely
     terminate :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

  #. Replace the |newversion| binary with the |oldversion| binary and        restart.

     .. note::

        .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-downgrade-command-line-options.rst

  #. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state. To check
     the member's state, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the
     member and run :method:`rs.status()` method.

  #. Once the member is in ``SECONDARY`` stage, downgrade the next
     secondary.

title: "Downgrade arbiter replica set member, if any."
level: 4
ref: downgrade-arbiters
content: |

  Skip this step if the replica set does not include an arbiter.
  
  Downgrade the :ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiter-configuration>` member of
  the replica set:

  a. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod`. See
     :ref:`terminate-mongod-processes` for additional ways to safely
     terminate :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

  #. Delete the arbiter data directory. The 
     :setting:`storage.dbPath` configuration setting or 
     :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` command line option specify the
     data directory of the arbiter :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

     .. code-block:: shell

        rm -rf /path/to/mongodb/datafiles

  #. Replace the |newversion| binary with the |oldversion| binary and restart.

     .. note::

        .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-downgrade-command-line-options.rst

  #. Wait for the member to recover to ``ARBITER`` state. To check
     the member's state, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the
     member and run :method:`rs.status()` method.

title: Step down the primary.
level: 4
ref: step-down-primary
pre: |
  Use :method:`rs.stepDown()` in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to
  step down the :term:`primary` and force the normal :ref:`failover
  <replica-set-failover>` procedure.
action:
  language: javascript
  code:
    rs.stepDown()
post: |
  :method:`rs.stepDown()` expedites the failover procedure and is
  preferable to shutting down the primary directly.
---
title: "Replace and restart the former primary."
level: 4
ref: downgrade-primary
content: |
  When :method:`rs.status()` shows that the primary has stepped down
  and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state:

  a. Shut down the previous primary.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

  b. Replace the :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with
     the |oldversion| binary and restart.
