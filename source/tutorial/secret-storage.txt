You can choose the |secret-store| for |k8s-op-short|. The secret
storage tool is a secure place to store sensitive information for the components
that |k8s-op-short| manages. This includes secrets for MongoDB databases, |onprem|, and AppDB.

Once you configure secret storage, |k8s-op-short| accesses the tool, retrieves
the secrets, and uses them to establish connections securely.

Supported Secret Storage Tools
------------------------------

|k8s-op-short| supports the following |secret-stores|:

- |k8s|: store sensitive information as |k8s-secrets| (the built-in secret
  storage for |k8s|). |k8s| |k8s-secrets|
  store authentication credentials so that only |k8s| can access them.
- |hashicorp-vault|: store sensitive information in |vault-short|, a third
  party service for secret management.
  
Secrets You Can Store
---------------------

You can use any supported |secret-store| for any secret in the |k8s-op|
documentation except those listed in the :ref:`limitations
<k8s-secret-storage-tool-limits>`. 

.. important::

   After configuration, |k8s-op-short| uses your selected |secret-store|
   for **all** secrets except those listed in the :ref:`limitations <k8s-secret-storage-tool-limits>`.
   You can't mix and match |secret-stores|.

.. _k8s-secret-storage-tool-limits:

Limitations
-----------

The following limitations exist for the supported |secret-stores|:

- Some registries, such as OpenShift, require :ref:`imagePullSecrets <imagePullSecrets>`
  to pull images from the repository. The |k8s-op-short| can't provide imagePullSecrets from
  |hashicorp-vault|. You can :k8sdocs:`specify a kubelet image credential provider </tasks/kubelet-credential-provider/kubelet-credential-provider/>`
  to retrieve credentials for a container image registry using |k8s| instead.

Set the Secret Storage Tool
---------------------------

To set the |secret-store|, select one of the following options:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Kubernetes Secret Storage
      :tabid: usek8s

      All tutorials in this |k8s-op| documentation use |k8s| |k8s-secrets| by default.
      To use |k8s| |k8s-secrets| to store secrets for the |k8s-op-short|, proceed with
      installation of the |k8s-op-short| and follow the steps in the tutorials.

   .. tab:: HashiCorp Vault
      :tabid: usevault

      To use |hashicorp-vault| to store secrets for the
      |k8s-op-short|, complete the following procedure.

      Prerequisites
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Before you begin, you must:

      - Set up a |vault-short| instance. The |k8s| cluster where the
        |k8s-op-short| is running must have access to the |vault-short|
        instance.

        .. note::
           Ensure that |vault-short| is **not** running in `dev mode <https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/dev-server>`__ 
           and that your |vault-short| installation follows any applicable
           `configuration recommendations <https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/production-hardening>`__.
      - Enable `Kubernetes Authentication <https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/kubernetes>`__
        for the |vault-short| instance. This allows you to authenticate with
        |vault-short|.
      - `Deploy the Vault Agent sidecar injector <https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/kubernetes-sidecar>`__
        in the |k8s| cluster. This allows you to inject secrets from
        |vault-short| into your |k8s| Pods.
      - Download the four `Vault policy files <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes/tree/master/vault_policies>`__
        for the |k8s-op-short|, MongoDB database, |onprem|, and AppDB.

Next Steps
----------

After you configure the |secret-store| for the |k8s-op-full|, you can:

- Read the :ref:`Considerations <k8s-considerations>`.
- Complete the :ref:`Prerequisites <k8s-prerequisites>`.
- :ref:`Install the Kubernetes Operator <install-k8s-operator>`.
