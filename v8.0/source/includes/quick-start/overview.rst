This guide shows you how to create a .NET application that uses the {+provider-short+}
to connect to a **MongoDB Atlas cluster**. If you prefer to connect to MongoDB
using another programming language, see our
:driver:`list of official MongoDB drivers <>`.

The {+provider-short+} simplifies operations on data in MongoDB clusters by mapping the 
data to .NET objects. 

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that hosts your data
on MongoDB clusters. In this guide, we show you how to get started with your
own free (no credit card required) cluster.

Follow the steps below to connect your {+provider-short+} application to a MongoDB Atlas
cluster.
