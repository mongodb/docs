.. default-domain:: mongodb

|service-fullname|'s |fts| feature offers fine-grained text indexing to
enable advanced search functionality without any additional management
required. |fts| provides options for several kinds of :ref:`text
analyzers <analyzers-ref>`, score-based results ranking, and a rich
:ref:`query language <query-syntax-ref>`. 

.. admonition:: Beta
   :class: note

   |fts| beta is available only on |service| ``M30`` clusters running
   MongoDB 4.2. Non-|service| MongoDB
   deployments can use :manual:`text indexing </core/index-text/>`.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started creating and querying a full-text index, see the
:ref:`Full Text Search Tutorial <fts-tutorial-ref>`.

Find out more about:

:ref:`Analyzers <analyzers-ref>`
  Analyzers control the way your full-text index is constructed. You
  can select an analyzer to customize your index to make the best use
  of a particular language's vocabulary and grammar, or to create an
  index which is language-neutral.

:ref:`Index Definition Format <ref-index-definitions>`
  You can customize your index definition to take advantage of
  :ref:`static and dynamic <static-dynamic-mappings>` field mappings.

:ref:`Index Management <ref-index-management>`
  Learn how to :ref:`create <ref-create-index>`,
  :ref:`edit <ref-edit-index>`, and :ref:`delete <ref-delete-index>`
  |fts| indexes in |service|.

:ref:`The $searchBeta Aggregation Pipeline Stage <query-syntax-ref>`
  Construct |fts| queries with the ``$searchBeta``
  :manual:`aggregation pipeline </aggregation>` stage. Find reference
  pages for the ``$searchBeta`` operators with examples here.

:ref:`Performance Considerations <perf-ref>`
  Information about how |fts| affects database performance and how
  to monitor resource usage.

:ref:`Scoring <scoring-ref>`
  Information about how |fts| ranks query results.

:ref:`Highlighting <highlight-ref>`
  Information about how to return highlighted |fts| search results.
