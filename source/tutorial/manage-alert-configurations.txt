Manage Alert Configurations
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

An alert configuration defines the conditions that trigger an alert and
defines how notifications are sent. You can access and manage alert
configurations through the :guilabel:`Activity` tab.

|mms| creates the following alert configurations automatically when you create a
new group:

- Users awaiting approval to join group

- Host is exposed to the public internet

- User added to group

- Monitoring Agent is down

If you enable Backup, |mms| creates the following alert configurations for the
group if they do not already exist:

- Oplog Behind

- Resync Required

- Cluster Mongos Is Missing

.. include:: /includes/steps/view-alert-configurations.rst

Create or Clone an Alert Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create or clone an alert configuration, see
:doc:`/tutorial/create-alert`.

Modify an Alert Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each alert configuration has a distribution list, a frequency for sending
the alert, and a waiting period after an alert state triggers before
sending the first alert. The minimum frequency for sending an alert is 5
minutes.

.. include:: /includes/steps/alert-configuration-edit.rst

Delete an Alert Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you delete an alert configuration that has open alerts, |mms| cancels
the open alerts whether or not they have been acknowledged and sends no
further notifications.

.. include:: /includes/steps/alert-configuration-delete.rst

Disable or Enable an Alert Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you disable an alert configuration, |mms| cancels active alerts
related to the disabled configuration. The configuration remains visible
in a grayed-out state and can be later re-enabled.
