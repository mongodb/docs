You incur {+atlas-sp+} costs for the following items: 

- Stream Processing Instance (SPI)
- Data Transfer

.. note:: Limited Cloud Provider and Regional Availability

   As of Public Preview, {+atlas-sp+} is only available in the 
   |AWS| ``us-east-1`` region.

Stream Processing Instance (SPI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges per hour per {+SPI+} worker, where the worker resources and the 
hourly rate are determined by the {+SPI+} tier. You are billed when there is 
at least one stream processor running in your {+SPI+} tier. A {+SPI+} worker can 
run up to 4 stream processors. The 5th stream processor will spin up a new worker 
for which you will be charged an additional {+SPI+} worker. Billing is recorded in 
one-second increments.

|service| charges prices of $0.19 per hour for an ``SP10`` worker and $0.39 per hour for an 
``SP30`` worker. Each ``SP10`` worker provides 1 vCPU and 2 GB of RAM, and each ``SP30`` 
worker provides 2 vCPU and 8 GB of RAM.

.. note:: Exceptions to Stream Processing Instance Cost

   |service| doesn't charge for storage.

.. note:: Upcoming {+SPI+} Tiers
   
   The upcoming ``SP50`` worker tier for {+atlas-sp+} provides 8 vCPU and 32 GB of RAM 
   at a price of $1.56 per hour.
