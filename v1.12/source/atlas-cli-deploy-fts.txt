This tutorial shows you how to use the ``atlas deployments`` 
command to create an |fts| index, run a query, and work with
{+avs+}.

Complete the Prerequisites
--------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-deploy-tutorial-prereqs.rst

- Create an |service| deployment.

  **Example:**

  .. code-block:: sh
            
     atlas deployments setup

  To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-cli-deploy-local`.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-avs-mdb-version.rst

- Download and load the sample data.

  **Example:**

  a. Run the following command to download the sample data:

     .. code-block:: sh
            
        curl  https://atlas-education.s3.amazonaws.com/sampledata.archive -o sampledata.archive

  #. Copy and paste the following command into your terminal and 
     replace ``{port-number}`` with the port for your 
     deployment:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongorestore --archive=sampledata.archive --port={port-number}

.. _atlas-cli-fts-index-query:

Create an Atlas Search Index and Run a Query
--------------------------------------------

Use the ``atlas deployments`` command to work with |fts|. To learn 
more, see :atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>`.

You can run this command in the following ways: 
      
- **Interactive Mode**: the command prompts you for the 
  |fts| settings.

  .. note::

     **Interactive Mode** allows you to create a basic |fts| index with 
     default settings.

- **Non-Interactive Mode (Flags)**: you run the command 
  with the specified options. The command does not prompt you to 
  provide further values.
- **Non-Interactive Mode (Configuration File)**: you run the command 
  with the specified settings in the configuration file. The command 
  does not prompt you to provide further values.

Click one of the following tabs to see the command for your preferred 
mode.
