ref: deploy-sharded-cluster-name
content: |
  - :guilabel:`Cluster Name`
  - Specify the name of your sharded cluster deployment. You cannot 
    change this once set. 
---
ref: deploy-sharded-csrs-name
content: |
  - :guilabel:`Config Server Replica Set Name`
  - Specify the name of your :manual:`Config Server Replica Set 
    </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers/>`. You cannot
    change this once set. This setting corresponds to the 
    :rsconf:`_id <rsconf._id>` replica configuration option.

    |mms| only displays this option if you selected
    MongoDB 3.2 or later as the :guilabel:`Version` of your
    configuration servers.

---
ref: deploy-sharded-shard-name
content: |
  - :guilabel:`Shard Name Prefix`
  - Specify the prefix of each :term:`shard` in the cluster. |mms| 
    names each shard in the cluster using the ``<prefix_n>`` format, 
    where ``n`` is a 0-indexed, monotonically increasing integer.
---
ref: deploy-sharded-process-name
content: |

  - :guilabel:`Process Name`
  - Hostname and port of a :binary:`~bin.mongod` or 
    :binary:`~bin.mongos` associated to the sharded cluster.

    |mms| groups :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes under their parent
    replica set name, and :binary:`~bin.mongos` processes under
    :guilabel:`mongoses`. |mms| then groups all the cluster components
    under the cluster name. Click the :icon:`caret-right` to the left 
    of a grouping to list its sub-groups or processes. Modifying any of 
    the available settings for a grouping changes the corresponding 
    value in its sub-groups and processes.

    .. note::

       For clusters running MongoDB 3.0 or earlier, |mms| groups
       the config server :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes under
       :guilabel:`configServers`.
