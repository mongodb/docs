.. note::

   To reference variables in :ref:`pipeline <lookup-join-pipeline>`
   stages, use the ``"$$<variable>"`` syntax.

   The :ref:`let <lookup-join-let>` variables can be accessed by the
   stages in the :ref:`pipeline <lookup-join-pipeline>`, including
   additional :pipeline:`$lookup` stages nested in the ``pipeline``.
   
   - A :pipeline:`$match` stage requires the use of an
     :query:`$expr` operator to access the variables. The :query:`$expr`
     operator allows the use of aggregation expressions inside of the
     :pipeline:`$match` syntax.

     .. include:: /includes/expr-operators-and-indexes.rst

   - Other (non-:pipeline:`$match`) stages in the :ref:`pipeline
     <lookup-join-pipeline>` do not
     require an :query:`$expr` operator to access the variables.
