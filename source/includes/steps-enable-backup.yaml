          Using a secondary is preferred because it minimizes

        - - :guilabel:`MongoDB Memory Mapped Files` or

          - :guilabel:`WiredTiger`.

            If you select this option, |mms| limits backups to
            deployments with fewer than 100,000 files. Files includes
            collections and indexes.

          See the considerations in :ref:`Storage Engines
          <considerations-backup-storage-engine>`.

        - Same storage engine as the primary node of the database being
          backed up.
