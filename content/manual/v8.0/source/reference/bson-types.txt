:term:`BSON` is a binary serialization format used to store documents
and make remote procedure calls in MongoDB. The BSON specification is
located at `bsonspec.org <http://bsonspec.org/>`_.

Each BSON type has both integer and string identifiers as listed in the
following table:

.. include:: /includes/fact-bson-types.rst

- The :query:`$type` operator supports using these values to query
  fields by their BSON type. :query:`$type` also supports the 
  ``number`` alias, which matches the integer, decimal, double, and
  long BSON types.

- The :expression:`$type` aggregation operator returns the BSON type of
  its argument.
  
- The :expression:`$isNumber` aggregation operator
  returns ``true`` if its argument is a BSON integer, decimal, double,
  or long.

To determine a field's type, see :ref:`check-types-in-shell`.

If you convert BSON to JSON, see
the :ref:`Extended JSON <mongodb-extended-json-v2>` reference.

The following sections describe special considerations for particular
BSON types.

.. _document-bson-type-binary-data:

Binary Data
-----------

A BSON binary ``binData`` value is a byte array. A ``binData`` value
has a subtype that indicates how to interpret the binary data. The
following table shows the subtypes:

.. include:: /includes/binary-subtypes.rst

.. _document-bson-type-object-id:
.. _objectid:

ObjectId
--------

ObjectIds are small, likely unique, fast to generate, and ordered.
ObjectId values are 12 bytes in length, consisting of:

.. include:: /includes/fact-ObjectId-construct.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-id-field.rst

MongoDB clients should add an ``_id`` field with a unique ObjectId.
Using ObjectIds for the ``_id`` field provides the following additional
benefits:

- You can access ``ObjectId`` creation time in :binary:`~bin.mongosh` 
  using the :method:`ObjectId.getTimestamp()` method.

- ObjectIds are approximately ordered by creation time, but are not 
  perfectly ordered. Sorting a collection on an ``_id`` field 
  containing ``ObjectId`` values is roughly equivalent to sorting by 
  creation time. 

  .. important::

     .. include:: /includes/fact-ObjectId-timestamp-order.rst

Use the :method:`ObjectId()` methods to set and retrieve ObjectId
values.

.. include:: /includes/reference/fact-objectid-and-mongosh.rst


.. _document-bson-type-string:

String
------

BSON strings are UTF-8. In general, drivers for each programming
language convert from the language's string format to UTF-8 when
serializing and deserializing BSON. This makes it possible to store
most international characters in BSON strings with ease.
[#sort-string-internationalization]_ In addition, MongoDB
:query:`$regex` queries support UTF-8 in the regex string.

.. [#sort-string-internationalization] Given strings using UTF-8
   character sets, using :method:`sort() <cursor.sort()>` on strings
   will be reasonably correct. However, because internally
   :method:`sort() <cursor.sort()>` uses the C++ ``strcmp`` api, the
   sort order may handle some characters incorrectly.

.. _document-bson-type-timestamp:

Timestamps
----------

BSON has a special timestamp type for *internal* MongoDB use and is
**not** associated with the regular :ref:`document-bson-type-date`
type. This internal timestamp type is a 64 bit value where:

- the most significant 32 bits are a ``time_t`` value (seconds since
  the Unix epoch)

- the least significant 32 bits are an incrementing ``ordinal`` for
  operations within a given second.

While the BSON format is little-endian, and therefore stores the least
significant bits first, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance
always compares the ``time_t`` value before
the ``ordinal`` value on all platforms, regardless of
endianness.

In replication, the :term:`oplog` has a ``ts`` field. The values in
this field reflect the operation time, which uses a BSON timestamp
value.

Within a single :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, timestamp values in the
:term:`oplog` are always unique.

.. note::

   The BSON timestamp type is for *internal* MongoDB use. For most
   cases, in application development, you will want to use the BSON
   date type. See :ref:`document-bson-type-date` for more
   information.

.. _document-bson-type-date:

Date
----

BSON Date is a 64-bit integer that represents the number of
milliseconds since the Unix epoch (Jan 1, 1970). This results in a
representable date range of about 290 million years into the past and
future.

The `official BSON specification <http://bsonspec.org/#/specification>`_
refers to the BSON Date type as the *UTC datetime*.

BSON Date type is signed. [#unsigned-date]_ Negative values represent
dates before 1970.

To construct a ``Date`` in :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, you can use the 
``new Date()`` or ``ISODate()`` constructor. 

Construct a Date With the New Date() Constructor 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To construct a ``Date`` with the ``new Date()`` constructor, run the following 
command: 

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   var mydate1 = new Date()
   
The ``mydate1`` variable outputs a date and time wrapped as an ISODate: 

.. io-code-block:: 

   .. input:: 
      :language: javascript
      
      mydate1
      
   .. output:: 
      :language: javascript 
      
      ISODate("2020-05-11T20:14:14.796Z")
   
Construct a Date With the ISODate() Constructor 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To construct a ``Date`` using the ``ISODate()`` constructor, run the following 
command:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   var mydate2 = ISODate()

The ``mydate2`` variable stores a date and time wrapped as an ISODate: 

.. io-code-block:: 

   .. input:: 
      :language: javascript 
      
      mydate2
      
   .. output:: 
      :language: javascript 
      
      ISODate("2020-05-11T20:14:14.796Z")

Convert a Date to a String 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

To print the ``Date`` in a ``string`` format, use the ``toString()`` method:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: javascript

      mydate1.toString()

   .. output:: 
      :language: javascript 

      Mon May 11 2020 13:14:14 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)

Return the Month Portion of a Date 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also return the month portion of the ``Date`` value. Months are 
zero-indexed, so that January is month ``0``. 

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: 
      :language: javascript

      mydate1.getMonth()

   .. output:: 
      :language: javascript

      4

.. [#unsigned-date] Prior to version 2.0, ``Date`` values were
   incorrectly interpreted as *unsigned* integers, which affected
   sorts, range queries, and indexes on ``Date`` fields. Because
   indexes are not recreated when upgrading, please re-index if you
   created an index on ``Date`` values with an earlier version, and
   dates before 1970 are relevant to your application.

``decimal128`` BSON Data Type 
-----------------------------

``decimal128`` is a 128-bit decimal representation for storing very 
large or very precise numbers, whenever rounding decimals is important. 
It was created in August 2009 as part of the 
`IEEE 754-2008 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008_revision>`__ 
revision of floating points. When you need high precision when 
working with BSON data types, you should use ``decimal128``.

``decimal128`` supports 34 decimal digits of precision, or 
`significand <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significand>`__ along with 
an exponent range of -6143 to +6144. The significand is not normalized
in the ``decimal128`` standard, allowing for multiple possible representations: 
``10 x 10^-1 = 1 x 10^0 = .1 x 10^1 = .01 x 10^2``, etc. Having the 
ability to store maximum and minimum values in the order of ``10^6144`` 
and ``10^-6143``, respectively, allows for a lot of precision.

Use ``decimal128`` With the ``Decimal128()`` Constructor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In MongoDB, you can store data in ``decimal128`` format using the
``Decimal128()`` constructor. If you pass in the decimal value 
as a string, MongoDB stores the value in the database as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true 

   Decimal128("9823.1297")

You can also pass in the decimal value as a ``double``:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true 

   Decimal128.fromStringWithRounding("1234.99999999999")

You should also consider the usage and support your programming 
language has for ``decimal128``. The following languages don’t 
natively support this feature and require a plugin 
or additional package to get the functionality:

- **Python:** The `decimal.Decimal <https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html>`__ 
  module can be used for floating-point arithmetic.
- **Java:** The `Java BigDecimal <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html>`__ 
  class provides support for ``decimal128`` numbers.
- **Node.js:**  There are several packages that provide support, 
  such as `js-big-decimal <https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-big-decimal>`__ 
  or `node.js bigdecimal <https://www.npmjs.com/package/bigdecimal>`__
  available on `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/>`__.

Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~

When you perfom mathematical calculations programmatically, you can sometimes 
receive unexpected results. The following example in Node.js yields incorrect results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   > 0.1
   0.1
   > 0.2
   0.2
   > 0.1 * 0.2
   0.020000000000000004
   > 0.1 + 0.1
   0.010000000000000002

Similarly, the following example in Java produces incorrect output: 

.. io-code-block:: 
   :copyable: true 

   .. input:: 
      :language: java 
      :linenos: 

      class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("0.1 * 0.2:");
            System.out.println(0.1 * 0.2);
         }
      }

   .. output::
      :language: javascript
      :linenos: 

      0.1 * 0.2:
      0.020000000000000004

The same computations in Python, Ruby, Rust, and other languages
produce the same results. This happens because binary floating-point 
numbers do not represent base 10 values well. 

For example, the ``0.1`` used in the above examples is represented 
in binary as ``0.0001100110011001101``. Most of the time, this 
does not cause any significant issues. However, in applications 
such as finance or banking where precision is important, 
use ``decimal128`` as your data type.
