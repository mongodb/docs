A landing zone is a framework for establishing a well-architected and
pre-configured cloud environment. A MongoDB {+service+} landing zone
defines organization-specific requirements for operational efficiency,
security, reliability, performance, and cost, as well as the tools,
procedures, and {+service+} configurations that teams must use to meet
these requirements. We recommend that all enterprise customers design a
landing zone before moving workloads to {+service+}.

Designing and implementing a landing zone can help you avoid expensive
efforts to redesign initial setups later. For example, in recent
discussions to move their workloads to {+service+}, one longtime MongoDB
enterprise customer cited concerns about peer financial services
companies struggling with user data leaks and runaway cloud costs due to
inconsistent encryption policies and redundant servers across business
units. To avoid these risks, this enterprise customer worked with our
`Professional Services <https://www.mongodb.com/services/consulting>`__
team to design a landing zone that aligned all of their teams and
stakeholders on company requirements, including encryption-at-rest with
{+byok+} and FinOps integrations to tag and track spending.

You can use this Architecture Center content as a starting point for you
to build your own well-architected {+service+} environment. We recommend
that you compile the following resources in a document and customize
them to meet your organization's goals. {+ps+} can help you adjust your
landing zone design to best fit your enterprise's requirements.

What Are Some Landing Zone Considerations?
------------------------------------------

As you create your landing zone, define requirements for the following considerations: 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80 

   * - Consideration
     - Description
   * - System Hierarchy
     - Choose a deployment hierarchy that groups your {+service+}
       organizations, projects, and clusters to promote isolation and
       separation of responsibilities between business units,
       environments, and billable groups as needed. For example, you can
       group business units into individual organizations to ensure that
       Sales credentials cannot authenticate to Product resources. We
       also recommend that you separate your development and production
       environments into individual projects or organizations to meet
       different security and resiliency requirements for each
       environment.
       
       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see
       :ref:`arch-center-hierarchy`.

   * - Security
     - By default, {+service+} blocks all access to your clusters,
       enforces |tls-ssl| encryption for all connections to your
       databases, and encrypts data at rest using :ref:`cloud provider
       disk encryption <security-kms-encryption>`. You must define the
       following security requirements to enable secure access to your
       clusters: 


       - Network security configurations such as IP access list
         restrictions, or required private endpoints and |vpc|
         connections to limit the extension of your network trust
         boundary
       - Mechanisms for how to authenticate users and authorize their
         access to the |service| control plane ({atlas-ui+} and
         {+atlas-admin-api+}), database resources, and database
         operations
       - Additional data encryption requirements for data in transit, at
         rest, and in use

       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see the following pages:

       - :ref:`arch-center-network-security`
       - :ref:`arch-center-auth`
       - :ref:`arch-center-data-encryption`
       - :ref:`arch-center-auditing-logging`

   * - Compliance
     - Consider how your deployment's data residency determines data
       sovereignty and therefore which laws apply to your data. Identify
       and account for any specific legal and regulatory requirements
       not clearly articulated within other categories of requirements. 

       Your data residency depends on which regions and geographies you
       choose to deploy to in your deployment paradigm, and whether you
       choose to partition your data between geographies.  

       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see the
       following pages:

       - :ref:`arch-center-compliance`
       - :ref:`arch-center-paradigms`

   * - Reliability and Resiliency
     - Define and record standards for reliability and resiliency that
       can be achieved through a disaster recovery plan and high
       availability architecture: 

       - To begin, define an optimal {+rpo+} and {+rto+} for your
         organization based on app criticality levels.
         
         - If your RTO and RPO are near-zero, then define a **high
           availability architecture** to ensure near-continuous
           operation during outages. This may involve requiring
           additional nodes, regions, or cloud providers in your
           deployment paradigm to increase redundancy and support
           automatic failover, and scheduling maintenance windows to
           ensure that primary node restarts occur outside of
           business-critical hours. To learn more, see
           :ref:`arch-center-high-availability` and
           :ref:`arch-center-paradigms`.
         
         - If your RTO or RPO allow for longer periods of outage or data
           loss, define a **disaster recovery plan** to ensure that your
           application is prepared to recover from an outage. To learn
           more, see :ref:`arch-center-dr` and
           :ref:`arch-center-backups`.

           A thorough disaster recovery plan does the following:

           - Documents and tests recovery procedures such as shifting
             workloads between regions or cloud providers or performing
             snapshot restores to previous versions to recover from
             possible disaster scenarios such as zonal, regional, or
             cloud-provider outages, resource failures, and data
             corruption events.
           - Defines a backup snapshot schedule and requirements for
             snapshot retention and multi-region distribution to satisfy
             your {+rpo+} and {+rto+}.

   * - Billing
     - Identify any specific requirements for billing, such as
       integrations with FinOps tools for reporting and charge-back.
       You can build these requirements into the automation and
       provisioning process for {+service+} clusters to facilitate
       this integration.

       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see
       :ref:`arch-center-billing-data`.

   * - Data Retention
     - Identify and record your data retention policies. This may
       require creating a data classification framework that integrates
       with automation to archive or purge data according to its nature
       and purpose, such as financial records, customer data, or
       employee information that entail different legal and regulatory
       requirements. Identify performance characteristics for the
       retrieval of archived records.

       To get recommendations and learn more about this topic, see the following pages:
       
       - :ref:`arch-center-backups`
       - :ref:`arch-center-automation`

   * - Monitoring and Observability
     - Set standards for observability that define which logs and
       metrics you will monitor and how you will monitor them. For
       example, set up external system integrations that ingest
       {+service+} log files, audit logs, or activity feed data, or
       configure alerts and reporting guidelines for certain event
       types.

       the following pages:
       
       - :ref:`arch-center-monitoring-alerts`.
       - :ref:`arch-center-auditing-logging`.

   * - Auditing and Change Control
     - Define any auditing or change control requirements. This can
       include change approval processes and tools, along with reporting
       guidelines and integration into third-party systems for retention
       and analysis. These requirements may differ between your
       production and non-production environments.

Design Your Landing Zone
------------------------

{+ps+} team partners with enterprise
customers to create custom landing zones for {+service+}. If you're
working with {+ps+}, the resources on this
page can also help you plan for those discussions.

Use the following resources as a starting point for your {+service+}
landing zone. Designing a landing zone is an iterative process that
involves reviewing and realigning standards across teams. We recommend
that you compile all diagrams, recommendations, and examples on this
page in a document and adjust them to meet your organization's
requirements.

Example Landing Zone Diagram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example diagram unifies many of the architectural diagrams
across the {+atlas-arch-center+} in one image to visualize your landing
zone. You can adjust it as needed to customize it for your organization.

See the following landing zone guidance for more example setups with
different cloud providers: 

- `GCP's FAST MongoDB Atlas Configuration
  <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-fabric/tree/master/fast/project-templates/data-mongodb>`__
  is a project template that creates and configures a managed {+service+}
  cluster and connects it to a local {+vpc+} network via Private Endpoints.

- The `AWS and MongoDB {+service+} Landing Zone
  <https://github.com/mongodb-partners/AWS-MongoDB-Atlas-Landing-Zone>`__
  is a Terraform script that automates the setup of an {+service+}
  project, cluster, and private endpoint alongside an {+aws+} {+vpc+}
  with subnets and NAT gateways in multiple Availability Zones. This
  landing zone setup provides a starting point for enterprises to adopt
  MongoDB {+service+} services as part of a secure cloud storage
  solution.

Information In The {+atlas-arch-center+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To begin, copy the relevant guidance and examples in
:ref:`arch-center-hierarchy`, which helps you create your first
foundational components in {+service+}.

Then, review the guidance and examples for each of the pages nested
under each {+waf+} pillar in the {+atlas-arch-center+}. Copy the
diagrams, recommendations, tools, and examples that are relevant for
your organization.

The {+atlas-arch-center+} pages include:

- Operational Efficiency

  - :ref:`arch-center-automation`
  - :ref:`arch-center-monitoring-alerts`
  
- Security

  - :ref:`arch-center-network-security`
  - :ref:`arch-center-auth`
  - :ref:`arch-center-data-encryption`
  - :ref:`arch-center-compliance`
  - :ref:`arch-center-auditing-logging`

- Reliability

Your Organization's Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adjust the example landing zone diagram, recommendations, and examples
that you copied from the {+atlas-arch-center+} to fit your
organization's specific requirements. For example, if you use only 
{+gcp+} as a cloud provider, your landing zone should specify that
requirement and you should exclude any recommendations and examples
applicable only to |aws| and |azure|.

To identify more considerations and requirements specific to your
organization, see the previous section on
:ref:`Landing Zone Considerations <landing-zone-considerations>`.
