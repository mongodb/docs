Installing / Upgrading
======================
.. highlight:: bash

**PyMongo** is in the `Python Package Index
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/>`_.

.. warning:: **Do not install the "bson" package from pypi.** PyMongo comes
   with its own bson package; doing "pip install bson" or "easy_install bson"
   installs a third-party package that is incompatible with PyMongo.

Installing with pip
-------------------

We recommend using `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_
to install pymongo on all platforms:

.. code-block:: python

  $ python3 -m pip install pymongo

To get a specific version of pymongo:

.. code-block:: python

  $ python3 -m pip install pymongo==3.5.1

To upgrade using pip:

.. code-block:: python

  $ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pymongo

Dependencies
------------

PyMongo supports CPython 3.7+ and PyPy3.7+.

Required dependencies
.....................

Support for mongodb+srv:// URIs requires `dnspython
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dnspython>`_

.. _optional-deps:

Optional dependencies
.....................

GSSAPI authentication requires `pykerberos
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pykerberos>`_ on Unix or `WinKerberos
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/winkerberos>`_ on Windows. The correct
dependency can be installed automatically along with PyMongo:

.. code-block:: python

  $ python3 -m pip install "pymongo[gssapi]"

:ref:`MONGODB-AWS` authentication requires `pymongo-auth-aws
<https://pypi.org/project/pymongo-auth-aws/>`_:

.. code-block:: python

  $ python3 -m pip install "pymongo[aws]"



:ref:`OCSP` requires `PyOpenSSL
<https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/>`_, `requests
<https://pypi.org/project/requests/>`_ and `service_identity
<https://pypi.org/project/service_identity/>`_:

.. code-block:: python

  $ python3 -m pip install "pymongo[ocsp]"

Wire protocol compression with snappy requires `python-snappy
<https://pypi.org/project/python-snappy>`_:

.. code-block:: python

  $ python3 -m pip install "pymongo[snappy]"

Wire protocol compression with zstandard requires `zstandard
<https://pypi.org/project/zstandard>`_:

.. code-block:: python

  $ python3 -m pip install "pymongo[zstd]"

:ref:`Client-Side Field Level Encryption` requires `pymongocrypt
<https://pypi.org/project/pymongocrypt/>`_ and
`pymongo-auth-aws <https://pypi.org/project/pymongo-auth-aws/>`_:

.. code-block:: python

  $ python3 -m pip install "pymongo[encryption]"

You can install all dependencies automatically with the following
command:

.. code-block:: python

  $ python3 -m pip install "pymongo[gssapi,aws,ocsp,snappy,zstd,encryption]"

Installing from source
----------------------

If you'd rather install directly from the source (i.e. to stay on the
bleeding edge), install the C extension dependencies then check out the
latest source from GitHub and install the driver from the resulting tree:

.. code-block:: python

  $ git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver.git pymongo
  $ cd pymongo/
  $ pip install .

Installing from source on Unix
..............................

To build the optional C extensions on Linux or another non-macOS Unix you must
have the GNU C compiler (gcc) installed. Depending on your flavor of Unix
(or Linux distribution) you may also need a python development package that
provides the necessary header files for your version of Python. The package
name may vary from distro to distro.

Debian and Ubuntu users should issue the following command:

.. code-block:: python

  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev

Users of Red Hat based distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Amazon Linux, Oracle Linux,
Fedora, etc.) should issue the following command:

.. code-block:: python

  $ sudo yum install gcc python-devel

Installing from source on macOS / OSX
.....................................

If you want to install PyMongo with C extensions from source you will need
the command line developer tools. On modern versions of macOS they can be
installed by running the following in Terminal (found in
/Applications/Utilities/):

.. code-block:: python

  xcode-select --install

For older versions of OSX you may need Xcode. See the notes below for various
OSX and Xcode versions.

**Snow Leopard (10.6)** - Xcode 3 with 'UNIX Development Support'.

**Snow Leopard Xcode 4**: The Python versions shipped with OSX 10.6.x
are universal binaries. They support i386, PPC, and x86_64. Xcode 4 removed
support for PPC, causing the distutils version shipped with Apple's builds of
Python to fail to build the C extensions if you have Xcode 4 installed. There
is a workaround:

.. code-block:: python

  # For some Python builds from python.org
  $ env ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386 -arch x86_64' python -m easy_install pymongo

See `http://bugs.python.org/issue11623 <http://bugs.python.org/issue11623>`_
for a more detailed explanation.

**Lion (10.7) and newer** - PyMongo's C extensions can be built against
versions of Python 3.7+ downloaded from python.org. In all cases Xcode must be
installed with 'UNIX Development Support'.

**Xcode 5.1**: Starting with version 5.1 the version of clang that ships with
Xcode throws an error when it encounters compiler flags it doesn't recognize.
This may cause C extension builds to fail with an error similar to:

.. code-block:: python

  clang: error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]

There are workarounds:

.. code-block:: python

  # Apple specified workaround for Xcode 5.1
  # easy_install
  $ ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future easy_install pymongo
  # or pip
  $ ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future pip install pymongo

  # Alternative workaround using CFLAGS
  # easy_install
  $ CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments easy_install pymongo
  # or pip
  $ CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments pip install pymongo


Installing from source on Windows
.................................

If you want to install PyMongo with C extensions from source the following
requirements apply to both CPython and ActiveState's ActivePython:

Windows
~~~~~~~

Install Visual Studio 2015+.

.. _install-no-c:

Installing Without C Extensions
-------------------------------

By default, the driver attempts to build and install optional C
extensions (used for increasing performance) when it is installed. If
any extension fails to build the driver will be installed anyway but a
warning will be printed.

If you wish to install PyMongo without the C extensions, even if the
extensions build properly, it can be done using a command line option to
*pip install*:

.. code-block:: python

  $ NO_EXT=1 python -m pip install .

Installing a beta or release candidate
--------------------------------------

MongoDB, Inc. may occasionally tag a beta or release candidate for testing by
the community before final release. These releases will not be uploaded to pypi
but can be found on the
`GitHub tags page <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver/tags>`_.
They can be installed by passing the full URL for the tag to pip:

.. code-block:: python

  $ python3 -m pip install https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver/archive/4.4.0b0.tar.gz

Using PyMongo with MongoDB Atlas
================================

`Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud>`_ is MongoDB, Inc.'s hosted MongoDB as a
service offering. To connect to Atlas, pass the connection string provided by
Atlas to :py:class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient`:

.. code-block:: python

  client = pymongo.MongoClient(<Atlas connection string>)

Connections to Atlas require TLS/SSL.

.. warning:: Industry best practices recommend, and some regulations require,
  the use of TLS 1.1 or newer. Though no application changes are required for
  PyMongo to make use of the newest protocols, some operating systems or
  versions may not provide an OpenSSL version new enough to support them.

  Users of macOS older than 10.13 (High Sierra) will need to install Python
  from `python.org`_, `homebrew`_, `macports`_, or another similar source.

  Users of Linux or other non-macOS Unix can check their OpenSSL version like
  this:

.. code-block:: python

    $ openssl version

  If the version number is less than 1.0.1 support for TLS 1.1 or newer is not
  available. Contact your operating system vendor for a solution or upgrade to
  a newer distribution.

  You can check your Python interpreter by installing the `requests`_ module
  and executing the following command:

.. code-block:: python

    python -c "import requests; print(requests.get('https://www.howsmyssl.com/a/check', verify=False).json()['tls_version'])"

  You should see "TLS 1.X" where X is >= 1.

  You can read more about TLS versions and their security implications here:

Quick Start
===========

.. code-block:: python

  from pymongo import MongoClient

  client = MongoClient()
  client.drop_database("test-database")

This tutorial is intended as an introduction to working with
**MongoDB** and **PyMongo**.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before we start, make sure that you have the **PyMongo** distribution
installed. In the Python shell, the following
should run without raising an exception:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import pymongo

This tutorial also assumes that a MongoDB instance is running on the
default host and port. Assuming you have `downloaded and installed
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/>`_ MongoDB, you
can start it like so:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mongod

Making a Connection with MongoClient
------------------------------------
The first step when working with **PyMongo** is to create a
:py:class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient` to the running **mongod**
instance. Doing so is easy:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> from pymongo import MongoClient
  >>> client = MongoClient()

The above code will connect on the default host and port. We can also
specify the host and port explicitly, as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> client = MongoClient("localhost", 27017)

Or use the MongoDB URI format:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")

Getting a Database
------------------
A single instance of MongoDB can support multiple independent
`databases <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/databases-and-collections>`_. When
working with PyMongo you access databases using attribute style access
on :py:class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient` instances:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> db = client.test_database

If your database name is such that using attribute style access won't
work (like ``test-database``), you can use dictionary style access
instead:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> db = client["test-database"]

Getting a Collection
--------------------
A `collection <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/databases-and-collections>`_ is a
group of documents stored in MongoDB, and can be thought of as roughly
the equivalent of a table in a relational database. Getting a
collection in PyMongo works the same as getting a database:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> collection = db.test_collection

or (using dictionary style access):

.. code-block:: python

  >>> collection = db["test-collection"]

An important note about collections (and databases) in MongoDB is that
they are created lazily - none of the above commands have actually
performed any operations on the MongoDB server. Collections and
databases are created when the first document is inserted into them.

Documents
---------
Data in MongoDB is represented (and stored) using JSON-style
documents. In PyMongo we use dictionaries to represent documents. As
an example, the following dictionary might be used to represent a blog
post:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import datetime
  >>> post = {
  ...     "author": "Mike",
  ...     "text": "My first blog post!",
  ...     "tags": ["mongodb", "python", "pymongo"],
  ...     "date": datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.timezone.utc),
  ... }

Note that documents can contain native Python types (like
:py:class:`datetime.datetime` instances) which will be automatically
converted to and from the appropriate `BSON
<https://bsonspec.org/>`_ types.

.. todo:: link to table of Python <-> BSON types

Inserting a Document
--------------------
To insert a document into a collection we can use the
:py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert_one` method:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> posts = db.posts
  >>> post_id = posts.insert_one(post).inserted_id
  >>> post_id
  ObjectId('...')

When a document is inserted a special key, ``"_id"``, is automatically
added if the document doesn't already contain an ``"_id"`` key. The value
of ``"_id"`` must be unique across the
collection. :py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert_one` returns an
instance of :py:class:`~pymongo.results.InsertOneResult`. For more information
on ``"_id"``, see the `documentation on _id
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/>`_.

After inserting the first document, the *posts* collection has
actually been created on the server. We can verify this by listing all
of the collections in our database:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> db.list_collection_names()
  ['posts']

Getting a Single Document With :py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one`
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most basic type of query that can be performed in MongoDB is
:py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one`. This method returns a
single document matching a query (or ``None`` if there are no
matches). It is useful when you know there is only one matching
document, or are only interested in the first match. Here we use
:py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one` to get the first
document from the posts collection:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> import pprint
  >>> pprint.pprint(posts.find_one())
  {'_id': ObjectId('...'),
   'author': 'Mike',
   'date': datetime.datetime(...),
   'tags': ['mongodb', 'python', 'pymongo'],
   'text': 'My first blog post!'}

The result is a dictionary matching the one that we inserted previously.

.. note:: The returned document contains an ``"_id"``, which was
   automatically added on insert.

:py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one` also supports querying
on specific elements that the resulting document must match. To limit
our results to a document with author "Mike" we do:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> pprint.pprint(posts.find_one({"author": "Mike"}))
  {'_id': ObjectId('...'),
   'author': 'Mike',
   'date': datetime.datetime(...),
   'tags': ['mongodb', 'python', 'pymongo'],
   'text': 'My first blog post!'}

If we try with a different author, like "Eliot", we'll get no result:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> posts.find_one({"author": "Eliot"})
  >>>

.. _querying-by-objectid:

Querying By ObjectId
--------------------
We can also find a post by its ``_id``, which in our example is an ObjectId:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> post_id
  ObjectId(...)
  >>> pprint.pprint(posts.find_one({"_id": post_id}))
  {'_id': ObjectId('...'),
   'author': 'Mike',
   'date': datetime.datetime(...),
   'tags': ['mongodb', 'python', 'pymongo'],
   'text': 'My first blog post!'}

Note that an ObjectId is not the same as its string representation:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> post_id_as_str = str(post_id)
  >>> posts.find_one({"_id": post_id_as_str})  # No result
  >>>

A common task in web applications is to get an ObjectId from the
request URL and find the matching document. It's necessary in this
case to **convert the ObjectId from a string** before passing it to
``find_one``:

.. code-block:: python

  from bson.objectid import ObjectId

  # The web framework gets post_id from the URL and passes it as a string
  def get(post_id):
      # Convert from string to ObjectId:
      document = client.db.collection.find_one({'_id': ObjectId(post_id)})

.. seealso:: :ref:`web-application-querying-by-objectid`

Bulk Inserts
------------
In order to make querying a little more interesting, let's insert a
few more documents. In addition to inserting a single document, we can
also perform *bulk insert* operations, by passing a list as the
first argument to :py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert_many`.
This will insert each document in the list, sending only a single
command to the server:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> new_posts = [
  ...     {
  ...         "author": "Mike",
  ...         "text": "Another post!",
  ...         "tags": ["bulk", "insert"],
  ...         "date": datetime.datetime(2009, 11, 12, 11, 14),
  ...     },
  ...     {
  ...         "author": "Eliot",
  ...         "title": "MongoDB is fun",
  ...         "text": "and pretty easy too!",
  ...         "date": datetime.datetime(2009, 11, 10, 10, 45),
  ...     },
  ... ]
  >>> result = posts.insert_many(new_posts)
  >>> result.inserted_ids
  [ObjectId('...'), ObjectId('...')]

There are a couple of interesting things to note about this example:

- The result from :py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert_many` now
  returns two :py:class:`~bson.objectid.ObjectId` instances, one for
  each inserted document.
- ``new_posts[1]`` has a different "shape" than the other posts -
  there is no ``"tags"`` field and we've added a new field,
  ``"title"``. This is what we mean when we say that MongoDB is
  *schema-free*.

Querying for More Than One Document
-----------------------------------
To get more than a single document as the result of a query we use the
:py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find`
method. :py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find` returns a
:py:class:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor` instance, which allows us to iterate
over all matching documents. For example, we can iterate over every
document in the ``posts`` collection:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> for post in posts.find():
  ...     pprint.pprint(post)
  ...
  {'_id': ObjectId('...'),
   'author': 'Mike',
   'date': datetime.datetime(...),
   'tags': ['mongodb', 'python', 'pymongo'],
   'text': 'My first blog post!'}
  {'_id': ObjectId('...'),
   'author': 'Mike',
   'date': datetime.datetime(...),
   'tags': ['bulk', 'insert'],
   'text': 'Another post!'}
  {'_id': ObjectId('...'),
   'author': 'Eliot',
   'date': datetime.datetime(...),
   'text': 'and pretty easy too!',
   'title': 'MongoDB is fun'}

Just like we did with :py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one`,
we can pass a document to :py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find`
to limit the returned results. Here, we get only those documents whose
author is "Mike":

.. code-block:: python

  >>> for post in posts.find({"author": "Mike"}):
  ...     pprint.pprint(post)
  ...
  {'_id': ObjectId('...'),
   'author': 'Mike',
   'date': datetime.datetime(...),
   'tags': ['mongodb', 'python', 'pymongo'],
   'text': 'My first blog post!'}
  {'_id': ObjectId('...'),
   'author': 'Mike',
   'date': datetime.datetime(...),
   'tags': ['bulk', 'insert'],
   'text': 'Another post!'}

Counting
--------
If we just want to know how many documents match a query we can
perform a :py:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.count_documents` operation
instead of a full query. We can get a count of all of the documents
in a collection:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> posts.count_documents({})
  3

or just of those documents that match a specific query:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> posts.count_documents({"author": "Mike"})
  2

Range Queries
-------------
MongoDB supports many different types of `advanced queries
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/>`_. As an
example, lets perform a query where we limit results to posts older
than a certain date, but also sort the results by author:

.. code-block:: python

  >>> d = datetime.datetime(2009, 11, 12, 12)
  >>> for post in posts.find({"date": {"$lt": d}}).sort("author"):
  ...     pprint.pprint(post)
  ...
  {'_id': ObjectId('...'),
   'author': 'Eliot',
   'date': datetime.datetime(...),
   'text': 'and pretty easy too!',
   'title': 'MongoDB is fun'}
  {'_id': ObjectId('...'),
   'author': 'Mike',
   'date': datetime.datetime(...),
   'tags': ['bulk', 'insert'],
   'text': 'Another post!'}

Here we use the special ``"$lt"`` operator to do a range query, and
also call :py:meth:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.sort` to sort the results
by author.

Indexing
--------

Adding indexes can help accelerate certain queries and can also add additional
functionality to querying and storing documents. In this example, we'll
demonstrate how to create a `unique index
<http://mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-unique/>`_ on a key that rejects
documents whose value for that key already exists in the index.

First, we'll need to create the index:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> result = db.profiles.create_index([("user_id", pymongo.ASCENDING)], unique=True)
   >>> sorted(list(db.profiles.index_information()))
   ['_id_', 'user_id_1']

Notice that we have two indexes now: one is the index on ``_id`` that MongoDB
creates automatically, and the other is the index on ``user_id`` we just
created.

Now let's set up some user profiles:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> user_profiles = [{"user_id": 211, "name": "Luke"}, {"user_id": 212, "name": "Ziltoid"}]
   >>> result = db.profiles.insert_many(user_profiles)

The index prevents us from inserting a document whose ``user_id`` is already in
the collection:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> new_profile = {"user_id": 213, "name": "Drew"}
   >>> duplicate_profile = {"user_id": 212, "name": "Tommy"}
   >>> result = db.profiles.insert_one(new_profile)  # This is fine.
   >>> result = db.profiles.insert_one(duplicate_profile)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   DuplicateKeyError: E11000 duplicate key error index: test_database.profiles.$user_id_1 dup key: { : 212 }

.. seealso:: The MongoDB documentation on `indexes <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/>`_
