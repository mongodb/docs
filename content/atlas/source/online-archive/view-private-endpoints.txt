:oas-bump-atlas-op:`privateNetworkSettings/endpointIds/ 
<getgroupprivatenetworksettingendpointid>` endpoint with 
the ID of the private endpoint to retrieve. To learn more about the

Edit the Private Endpoint for Online Archives 
---------------------------------------------

MongoDB supports |aws| and |azure| private endpoints for your 
{+Online-Archive+}\s. You can edit the details associated with a private endpoint 
for {+Online-Archive+}\s from the {+atlas-ui+} and {+atlas-admin-api+}.

.. tabs::
 
   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: api

      To edit a private endpoint for an online archive through the {+atlas-admin-api+}, 
      send a ``POST`` request to the :oas-bump-atlas-op:`privateNetworkSettings 
      <createdatafederationprivateendpoint>` endpoint with 
      the unique ID of the private endpoint to edit. If you change the 
      comment associated with the specified endpoint, |service| makes no 
      change to the endpoint ID list. If you change the comment 
      associated with the specified endpoint, |service| updates the 
      ``comment`` value only in the endpoint ID list.

      To learn more about the syntax and options, see the :oas-bump-atlas-op:`{+atlas-admin-api+} documentation
      <createdatafederationprivateendpoint>`.
