This page lists the Global Access List Entries configured for the
|onprem| instance. Each entry represents a host IP or |cidr| block from
which |onprem| accepts incoming |api| requests. You can search for a
access list entry, add access list entries, and edit or delete existing
access list entries.

.. note::

   |mms| limits all actions in this section to users or Global |api|
   Keys that were granted the :authrole:`Global Owner` role.

.. _add-global-access-list-entry:

Add an Access List Entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Click :guilabel:`Add Access List Entry` to open the
   :guilabel:`Add Global Access List Entry` modal.

#. Set all values in the access list form:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 80
      :stub-columns: 1

      * - Access List Entry
        - Type the |ipv4| address, |ipv6| address, or |cidr| block that
          you want to allow to use the |onprem| |api|.

          .. note::

             You can click :guilabel:`Use Current IP Address` to add
             the public IP address of the host you are using to access
             |onprem|.

      * - Description
        - Type the purpose this IP address serves.

#. Click :guilabel:`Add Entry` if this global access list entry is
   correct. Click :guilabel:`Cancel` to close the modal without adding
   a new access list entry.

.. _edit-global-access-list-entry:

Edit an Access List Entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Once saved, any changes to this value impact applications that
   require the previous access list entry.

1. To the right of the access list entry that you want to edit, click
   :icon-mms:`ellipsis` then select :guilabel:`Edit Access List Entry` to
   open the :guilabel:`Edit Global Access List Entry` modal. |mms|
   displays the |ipv4| address, |ipv6| address, or |cidr| block for
   this access list entry in the modal.

#. Change the values in the access list form as needed:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 80
      :stub-columns: 1

      * - Access List Entry
        - Type the  |ipv4| address, |ipv6| address, or |cidr| block
          that you want to allow to use the |onprem| |api|.

          .. note::
            
             You can click :guilabel:`Use Current IP Address` to add
             the public IP address of the host you are using to access
             |onprem|.

      * - Description
        - Type the purpose this IP address serves.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save Entry` if you made changes to your global
   access list entry. Click :guilabel:`Cancel` to close the modal without
   editing the access list entry.

   It might take up to an hour for the changes to take effect. |onprem|
   returns an error if you send an |api| request before the changes take 
   effect. 

.. _delete-global-access-list-entry:

Delete an Access List Entry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Deleting a Global Access List Entry impacts applications that require
   that access list entry, unless another access list entry includes that
   address. If no entries cover the application address, the
   application cannot access the |api|.

1. To the right of the access list entry that you want to delete, click
   :icon-mms:`ellipsis` then select :guilabel:`Delete Access List Entry`.

   The :guilabel:`Delete Global Access List Entry` modal displays.

#. Type the entry's  |ipv4| address, |ipv6| address, or |cidr| block in
   the box to confirm that you want to delete this entry.

#. Click :guilabel:`Delete` if you want to delete your global
   access list entry. Click :guilabel:`Cancel` to close the modal without
   deleting the access list entry.
