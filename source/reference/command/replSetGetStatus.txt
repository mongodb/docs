Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: replSetGetStatus

   The ``replSetGetStatus`` command returns the status of the replica
   set from the point of view of the current server. You must run the
   command against the :term:`admin database`. The command has the
   following prototype format:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetGetStatus: 1 }

   The value specified does not affect the output of the command. Data
   provided by this command derives from data included in heartbeats
   sent to the current instance by other members of the replica set.
   Because of the frequency of heartbeats, these data can be several
   seconds out of date.

   You can also access this functionality through the
   :method:`rs.status()` helper in the :program:`mongo` shell.

   The :program:`mongod` must have replication enabled and be a member
   of a replica set for the for :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` to return
   successfully.

Output
------

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.set

   The ``set`` value is the name of the replica set, configured in the
   :setting:`replSet` setting. This is the same value as
   :data:`~local.system.replset._id` in :method:`rs.conf()`.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.date

   The value of the ``date`` field is an :term:`ISODate` of the
   current time, according to the current server. Compare this to the
   value of the :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.lastHeartbeat` to find the
   operational lag between the current host and the other hosts in the
   set.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.myState

   The value of
   :data:`~replSetGetStatus.myState` is an integer between ``0`` and
   ``10`` that represents the :doc:`replica state </reference/replica-states>` of the current member.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.members

   The ``members`` field holds an array that contains a document for
   every member in the replica set.

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.name

      The ``name`` field holds the name of the server.

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.self

      The ``self`` field is only included in the document for the
      current ``mongod`` instance in the members array. It's value is
      ``true``.

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.health

      The ``health`` value is only present for the other members of the
      replica set (i.e. not the member that returns
      :method:`rs.status`.) This field conveys if the member is up (i.e.
      ``1``) or down (i.e. ``0``.)

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.state

      The value of :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.state` is an
      integer between ``0`` and ``10`` that represents the
      :doc:`replica state </reference/replica-states>` of the member.

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.stateStr

      A string that describes :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.state`.

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.uptime

      The :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.uptime` field holds a value
      that reflects the number of seconds that this member has been
      online.

      This value does not appear for the member that returns the
      :method:`rs.status()` data.

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.optime

      A document that contains information regarding the last operation
      from the operation log that this member has applied.

      .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.optime.t

         A 32-bit timestamp of the last operation applied to this member
         of the replica set from the :term:`oplog`.

      .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.optime.i

         An incremented field, which reflects the number of operations
         in since the last time stamp. This value only increases if
         there is more than one operation per second.

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.optimeDate

      An :term:`ISODate` formatted date string that reflects the last
      entry from the :term:`oplog` that this member applied. If this
      differs significantly from
      :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.lastHeartbeat` this member is
      either experiencing "replication lag" *or* there have not been any
      new operations since the last update. Compare
      ``members.optimeDate`` between all of the members of the set.

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.lastHeartbeat

      The ``lastHeartbeat`` value provides an :term:`ISODate` formatted
      date and time of the transmission time of last heartbeat
      received from this member. Compare this value to the value of the
      :data:`~replSetGetStatus.date` and
      :data:`~replSetGetStatus.lastHeartBeatRecv` field to track
      latency between these members.

      This value does not appear for the member that returns the
      :method:`rs.status()` data.

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.lastHeartbeatRecv

      The ``lastHeartbeat`` value provides an :term:`ISODate` formatted
      date and time that the last heartbeat was received from this
      member. Compare this value to the value of the
      :data:`~replSetGetStatus.date` and
      :data:`~replSetGetStatus.lastHeartBeat` field to track
      latency between these members.

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.lastHeartbeatMessage

      When the last heartbeat included an extra message, the
      :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.lastHeartbeatMessage` contains
      a string representation of that message.

   .. data:: replSetGetStatus.members.pingMs

      The ``pingMs`` represents the number of milliseconds (ms) that a
      round-trip packet takes to travel between the remote member and
      the local instance.

      This value does not appear for the member that returns the
      :method:`rs.status()` data.

.. data:: replSetGetStatus.syncingTo

   The ``syncingTo`` field is only present on the output of
   :method:`rs.status()` on :term:`secondary` and recovering members,
   and holds the hostname of the member from which this instance is
   syncing.
