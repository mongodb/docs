You can bring data from existing MongoDB deployments, ``JSON``, or ``CSV``
files into deployments in |service| using either:

- live migration where |service| assists you, or
- tools for a self-guided migration of data from your existing deployments
  into |service|.

List of  Tools for Migrating to |service|
-----------------------------------------

The following table discusses how to choose between different tools for
data migration and import for common cluster configurations.

   * - Source Cluster Configuration
     - Import Strategy

   * - A :term:`replica set`, :term:`sharded cluster`, or standalone
       MongoDB node that are managed by |com|.
       
     - Use live migration where |com| **pushes** data to |service|
       using a secure :term:`link-token` without requiring access to the
       source cluster through the cluster's firewall. To locate push type
       migration in the |service| user interface, in the left-side panel
       of your organization's page, go to :guilabel:`Live Migration to Atlas`
       and select :guilabel:`Migrate from Ops Manager or Cloud Manager`.
     
       - Replica Set: :doc:`Live migrate (push) a replica set from Cloud Manager or Ops Manager to Atlas </import/migrate-from-com-rs>`.

       - Sharded Cluster: :doc:`Live migrate (push) a sharded cluster from Cloud Manager or Ops Manager to Atlas </import/migrate-from-com-sharded>`.

       - Standalone MongoDB node: :opsmgr:`Convert the standalone to a replica set in Ops Manager </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/>`
         or :cloudmgr:`convert the standalone to a replica set in Cloud Manager </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/>`
         and then :doc:`live migrate (push) <import/migrate-from-com-rs>`
         it to |service|.

   * - A :term:`replica set`, :term:`sharded cluster`, or standalone
       MongoDB node deployment that are not managed by |com|.

     - Use live migration where |com| **pulls** data from the source
       deployment and requires access to the source deployment through
       the deployment's firewall. To locate pull type live migration in
       the |service| user interface, in the left-side panel of your
       organization's page, go to :guilabel:`Live Migration to Atlas` and select :guilabel:`General Live Migration`.

       - Replica Set that is not managed by |com|: :doc:`Live migrate (pull) a replica set into Atlas </import/live-import>`.
       - Sharded Cluster that is not managed by |com|: If the application
         can tolerate a short period of downtime, :doc:`live migrate (pull) a sharded cluster into Atlas </import/live-import-sharded>`.

         If the application can tolerate a longer downtime, or if your
         cluster runs a MongoDB version that is no longer supported, use
         use :doc:`mongorestore </import/mongorestore>` and
         :manual:`back up the cluster with database dumps </tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-dumps>`.

         If the application requires a near-continuous uptime, contact
         MongoDB Support and share your uptime requirements and cluster
         configuration.

       - Standalone MongoDB deployment that is not managed by |com|: If
         you can :manual:`convert </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set>`
         the standalone to a single-node replica set, :doc:`live migrate (pull) a replica set into Atlas </import/live-import>`.
         |service| requires access to the source deployment through the
         deployment's firewall. If you can't convert the standalone to a
         replica set, use :doc:`mongorestore </import/mongorestore>`.

   * - A shared multi-tenant cluster, or a cluster where you have no
       access to the oplog.

     - Use :doc:`mongorestore </import/mongorestore>`.

   * - A standard "single :term:`shard`" :term:`sharded cluster` MongoDB
       deployment in Compose.

     - `Migrate from Compose to MongoDB Atlas <https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/cloud/migrate-from-compose/>`__.
