     * - Field
       - Necessity
       - Action
       - Default

     * - Identity Provider URI
       - Required
       - Type the |uri| for your |idp| you use to coordinate your
         Single Sign-On.

         This |uri| is the :guilabel:`IdP Entity ID or Issuer` from the
         |saml| |idp|.

         This |uri| must be the same as the ``Issuer URI`` in the SAML 
         response.

       - None

     * - SSO Endpoint URL
       - Required
       - Type the Single-Sign On |url| for your |idp|.

         This |url| is the :guilabel:`SAML Login URL` from your |idp|.

       - None

     * - SLO Endpoint URL
       - Optional
       - Type the |saml| |idp| |url| to be called if you want the
         |mms| user to log out of their |idp| when the |mms| user logs
         out of |mms|.

         This is the :guilabel:`SAML Logout URL` from your |idp|.

       - None

     * - Identity Provider X509 Certificate
       - Required
       - Paste your |idp|'s X.509 Certificate in this field. The |idp|

         include the entire certificate content including and starting
         with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and including and ending
         with `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`. |mms| uses this certificate
         to verify itself with the |idp|.

         This is the :guilabel:`X.509 Certificate` from your
         |idp|.

         This must be the same :guilabel:`X.509 Certificate` that you
         use to sign SAML Responses and Assertions.
         
       - None

     * - Identity Provider Signature Algorithm
       - Required
       - Select the algorithm used to encrypt the signature sent to and

         - ``rsa-sha256``
         - ``rsa-sha384``
         - ``rsa-sha512``

         This is the :guilabel:`Signature Algorithm` from your
         |idp|.
