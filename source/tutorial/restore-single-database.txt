.. COMMENT: Can we still restore a single database? Could we ever?

Overview
--------

Backup snapshots contain a complete copy of your :program:`mongod` data
directory. In MongoDB 2.6 and earlier, you can restore a portion of
your data, such as a single database or collection, from a backup with
the :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore` tools and the
:option:`--dbpath` option.

.. important::

   MongoDB 3.0 introduced major changes to the MongoDB tools in order
   to support additional storage engines such as WiredTiger. In MongoDB
   3.0, :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore` do not support
   the :option:`--dbpath` option. As such, you cannot use this
   procedure for a partial data restore on a :program:`mongod` running
   MongoDB 3.0.
   
   If you anticipate you will want to restore a single database,
   :doc:`create a backup for just that database
   </tutorial/enable-backup>` by excluding the databases or collections
   that you do not want to back up using the :guilabel:`Blacklist`
   field in the :guilabel:`Advanced Settings`.
