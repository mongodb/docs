title: Run the Windows Installer from the Windows Command Interpreter.
stepnum: 2
level: 4
ref: install
pre: |

  .. important::

     You must open the command interpreter as an
     :guilabel:`Administrator`.

          
  Use the ``.msi`` installer to install all MongoDB binaries, including
  `MongoDB Compass <https:///www.mongodb.com/products/compass>`__.

  From the Command Interpreter, go to the directory containing the
  ``.msi`` installation binary and run:

  .. include:: {{release_specification_default}}

  The operation installs the binaries to the default directory 
  ``C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin``.

  To specify a different installation location for the executables, 
  add the ``INSTALLLOCATION`` value.

  .. include:: {{release_specification_addlocation}}
  
  To suppress the installation of :ref:`MongoDB
  Compass <compass-index>`, you must explicitly include the
  ``SHOULD_INSTALL_COMPASS="0"`` argument.

  .. include:: {{release_specification_nocompass}}

  To install specific MongoDB component sets, you can specify them in
  the ``ADDLOCAL`` argument using a comma-separated list including one
  or more of the following component sets:

  .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 80

      * - Component Set Name
        - Binaries Included in the Component Set

      * - ``ServerNoService``
        - :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe`

      * - ``ServerService``
        - Set up :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` as a Windows service.

      * - ``Router``
        - :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe`
      * - ``Client``
        - :binary:`mongo.exe <bin.mongo>`
      * - ``MonitoringTools``
        - :binary:`mongostat.exe <bin.mongostat>`,
          :binary:`mongotop.exe <bin.mongotop>`
      * - ``ImportExportTools``
        - :binary:`mongodump.exe <bin.mongodump>`,
          :binary:`mongorestore.exe <bin.mongorestore>`,
          :binary:`mongoexport.exe <bin.mongoexport>`,
          :binary:`mongoimport.exe <bin.mongoimport>`
      * - ``MiscellaneousTools``
        - :binary:`bsondump.exe <bin.bsondump>`,
          :binary:`mongofiles.exe <bin.mongofiles>`

  For example, to install just the MongoDB server
  (:binary:`~bin.mongod.exe`) and the :binary:`mongo.exe <bin.mongo>`
  shell as well as set up the MongoDB server as a Windows service, run:

  .. include:: {{release_specification_service}}

  To include Compass in the installs, remove ``SHOULD_INSTALL_COMPASS="0"``.
