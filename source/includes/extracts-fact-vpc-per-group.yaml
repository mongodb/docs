   When |service| deploys an |service| group's first ``M10+`` paid cluster,
   |service| also creates a :abbr:`VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)` specific to
   the selected cloud service provider and region selected for the cluster.
   |service| associates all additional clusters deployed in the group to this
   :abbr:`VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)`, locking them to the cloud service
   provider and region. |service| also sets a default :abbr:`VPC (Virtual
   Private Cloud)` :abbr:`CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)` block address
   for the group.
   
   For clusters deployed on :ref:`amazon-aws`, |service| supports creating
   :doc:`VPC peering connections </security-vpc-peering>` between your
   |service| clusters and your other :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)`
   services. If you need a specific |service| VPC :abbr:`CIDR (Classless
   Inter-Domain Routing)` block address, configure a :doc:`VPC peering
   connection </security-vpc-peering>` before creating your first ``M10+``
   cluster.
   
   For |service| clusters deployed on :ref:`google-gcp` or
   :ref:`microsoft-azure`, add the IP addresses of your :abbr:`GCP (Google
   Cloud Platform)` or :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)` services to |service|
   :doc:`group IP whitelist </security-whitelist>` to grant those services
   access to the cluster.
