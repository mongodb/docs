   to build the :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

.. data:: buildInfo.versionArray

   An array that conveys version information about the

   more readable version of this string.

.. data:: buildInfo.version

   A string that conveys version information about the

   :binary:`~bin.mongod` server.

.. data:: buildInfo.javascriptEngine

   A string that reports the JavaScript engine used in the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance. By default, this is ``mozjs``.

.. data:: buildInfo.bits

   A number that reflects the target processor architecture of the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary.

.. data:: buildInfo.debug

   A boolean. ``true`` when built with debugging options.

.. data:: buildInfo.maxBsonObjectSize

   A number that reports the :limit:`Maximum BSON Document Size
   <BSON Document Size>`.

.. data:: buildInfo.openssl

   An embedded document describing the version of the TLS/SSL library
   that :binary:`~bin.mongod` was built with and is currently using.

.. data:: buildInfo.modules

   A list of add-on modules that :binary:`~bin.mongod` was built with. Possible
   values currently include "enterprise" and "rocksdb".

Unstable
~~~~~~~~

   The memory allocator that :binary:`~bin.mongod` uses. By default
   this is ``tcmalloc``.

.. data:: buildInfo.buildEnvironment

   An embedded document containing various debugging information about the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` build environment.
