Count Documents Method Example
==============================

You can get an approximation on the number of documents in a
collection by using the ``EstimatedDocumentCount()`` method and an exact
number of documents in a collection by using the ``CountDocuments()``
method.

Example
-------

.. include:: /includes/usage-examples/run-example-tip.rst

The following example performs the following on the ``movies``
collection:

- Approximates the number of documents in the collection
- Counts the number of documents in which the ``countries`` contains "China"

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/count.go
   :start-after: begin countDocuments
   :end-before: end countDocuments
   :emphasize-lines: 8, 15
   :language: go
   :dedent:

View a `fully runnable example <{+example+}/count.go>`__

Expected Result
---------------

After you run the full example, you should see the following:

- There are about ``23541`` documents in the ``movies`` collection
- There are ``303`` documents in the ``movies`` collection that contain "China" in the ``countries`` field

.. note::

    The exact number of documents may vary depending on your data set.
