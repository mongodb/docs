  Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the latest
  release in the |oldversion| series. If using a package manager, add a new
  repository for the |oldversion| binaries, then perform the actual downgrade
  process.

title: Disable the Balancer.
level: 4
ref: disable-balancer
content: |
  Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance in
  the sharded cluster, and run :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` to
  disable the balancer:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     sh.stopBalancer()

  .. note::

     If a migration is in progress, the system will complete the
     in-progress migration before stopping the balancer. You can run
     :method:`sh.isBalancerRunning()` to check the balancer's current
     state.

  To verify that the balancer is disabled, run
  :method:`sh.getBalancerState()`, which returns false if the balancer
  is disabled:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     sh.getBalancerState()

  For more information on disabling the balancer, see
  :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily`.

   Downgrade the shards one at a time.
   
   A. Downgrade the shard's :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>`
      members one at a time:

      a. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

         .. code-block:: javascript

            db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

      #. Replace the |newversion|
         binary with the |oldversion| binary and restart.

      #. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before
         downgrading the next secondary member. To check
         the member's state, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the shard
         and run :method:`rs.status()` method.

         Repeat to downgrade for each secondary member.

   #. Downgrade the shard :ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiter-configuration>`, if any.

      Skip this step if the replica set does not include an arbiter.

      a. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod`. See
         :ref:`terminate-mongod-processes` for additional ways to safely
         terminate :binary:`~bin.mongod` processes.

         .. code-block:: javascript

            db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

      #. Delete the contents of the arbiter data directory. The 
         :setting:`storage.dbPath` configuration setting or 
         :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>` command line option specify the
         data directory of the arbiter :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

         .. code-block:: shell

            rm -rf /path/to/mongodb/datafiles/*

      #. Replace the |newversion| binary with the |oldversion| binary and restart.

      #. Wait for the member to recover to ``ARBITER`` state. To check
         the member's state, connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the
         member and run :method:`rs.status()` method.

   #. Downgrade the shard's primary.

      a. Step down the replica set primary. Connect a
         :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary and use
         :method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and force an
         election of a new primary:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            rs.stepDown()

      #. Run :method:`rs.status()`.

         .. code-block:: javascript

            rs.status()

         When the status shows that the primary has stepped down and
         another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, proceed.

      #. Shut down the stepped-down primary.

         .. code-block:: javascript

            db.adminCommand( { shutdown: 1 } )

      #. Replace the |newversion|
         binary with the |oldversion| binary and restart.

   Repeat for the remaining shards.

   A. Downgrade the :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>`
      members of the config servers replica set (CSRS) one at a time:

      a. Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

         .. code-block:: javascript

         and run :method:`rs.status()` method.

         Repeat to downgrade for each secondary member.

   #. Step down the config server primary.

      a. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary and use

      #. Shut down the stepped-down primary.

  Once the downgrade of sharded cluster components is complete, connect
  a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` and
  :ref:`re-enable the balancer <sharding-balancing-enable>`.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     sh.startBalancer()

  The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method :method:`sh.startBalancer()`
  also enables auto-splitting for the sharded cluster.
