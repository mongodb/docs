The Realm C++ SDK currently supports these property types.

Optionals use the class template 
`std::optional <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional>`__.

Property Cheat Sheet

You can use the following types to define your object model
properties.

Supported Type Implementation Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some of the supported types above are aliases for:

- ``mixed``: A union-like object that can represent a value any of the 
  supported types. It is implemented using the class template 
  `std::variant <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant>`__.
  This implementation means that a ``mixed`` property holds a value of 
  one of its alternative types, or in the case of error - no value.
- For dates, use the `chrono library 
  <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono>`__
  to store a ``time_point`` relative to the ``system_clock``: 
  ``<std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock>>``

.. _cpp-map:

Map/Dictionary
--------------

The 
:cpp-sdk:`Map <structrealm_1_1managed_3_01std_1_1map_3_01std_1_1string_00_01T_01_4_00_01void_01_4.html>` 
is an associative array that contains key-value pairs with unique keys.

You can declare a Map as a property of an object:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.dog-map-model.cpp
   :language: cpp

String is the only supported type for a map key, but map values can be:

- Required versions of any of the SDK's supported data types
- Optional user-defined object links
- Optional embedded objects

.. include:: /includes/map-key-string-limitations.rst

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.percent-encode-disallowed-characters.cpp
   :language: cpp

.. _cpp-collection-types:

Collection Types
----------------

Realm has several types to represent groups of objects,
which we call **collections**. A collection is an object that contains
zero or more instances of one :ref:`Realm type
<cpp-realm-objects>`. Realm collections are **homogenous**:
all objects in a collection are of the same type.

You can filter and sort any collection using Realm's
:ref:`query engine <cpp-client-query-engine>`. Collections are
:ref:`live <cpp-live-object>`, so they always reflect the current state
of the realm instance on the current thread. You can also
listen for changes in the collection by subscribing to :ref:`collection
notifications <cpp-register-a-collection-change-listener>`.

.. _cpp-results-collections:

Results
~~~~~~~

The C++ SDK :cpp-sdk:`Results <structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1results.html>` 
collection is a type representing objects retrieved from queries. A 
``Results`` collection represents the lazily-evaluated results of a 
query operation. Results are immutable: you cannot add or remove elements 
to or from the results collection. Results have an associated query that 
determines their contents.

For more information, refer to :ref:`the Read documentation <cpp-crud-read>`.

.. _cpp-set-collections:

Set
~~~

The C++ SDK set collection represents a 
:ref:`to-many relationship <cpp-to-many-relationship>` containing 
distinct values. A C++ SDK set supports the following types (and their 
optional versions):

- Binary Data
- Bool
- Double
- Date
- Int64
- Mixed
- ObjectId
- Object
- String
- UUID

Like the C++ `std::set <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/set>`__,
the C++ SDK set is a generic type that is parameterized on the type it stores.

You can only call set mutation methods during a write transaction. You can 
register a change listener on a mutable set.

Collections as Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The C++ SDK also offers several collection types you can use as properties 
in your data model:

#. :cpp-sdk:`List 
   <structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1list.html>`, a type representing 
   :ref:`to-many relationships <cpp-list-collections>` in models.
#. :cpp-sdk:`Set 
   <structrealm_1_1managed_3_01std_1_1set_3_01T_01_5_01_4_01_4.html>`, 
   a type representing :ref:`to-many relationships <cpp-to-many-relationship>`
   in models where values are unique.
#. :cpp-sdk:`linking_objects 
   <structrealm_1_1linking__objects.html>`, a type 
   representing :ref:`inverse relationships 
   <cpp-define-an-inverse-relationship-property>` in models.
#. :cpp-sdk:`Map <structrealm_1_1managed_3_01std_1_1map_3_01std_1_1string_00_01T_01_4_00_01void_01_4.html>`, 
   a type representing an associative array of key-value pairs with unique keys.

.. _cpp-live-collections:

Collections are Live
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like :ref:`live objects <cpp-live-object>`, Realm collections
are usually **live**:

- Live results collections always reflect the current results of the associated query.
- Live lists always reflect the current state of the relationship on the realm instance.

The one case when a collection is **not** live is when the collection is 
unmanaged. For example, a List property of a Realm object that has not 
been added to a realm yet or that has been moved from a realm is not live.

Combined with :ref:`collection notifications
<cpp-register-a-collection-change-listener>`, live collections enable
clean, reactive code. For example, suppose your view displays the
results of a query. You can keep a reference to the results collection
in your view code, then read the results collection as needed without
having to refresh it or validate that it is up-to-date.

.. important:: Results indexes may change

   Since results update themselves automatically, do not
   store the positional index of an object in the collection
   or the count of objects in a collection. The stored index
   or count value could be outdated by the time you use
   it.
