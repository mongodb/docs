After connecting to a supported relational database, run Pre-Migration 
Analysis to identify potential data and configuration risks before attempting
data migration. The resulting report summarizes necessary actions to take
before migrating your data.

.. important::

   Relational Migrator supports Pre-Migration Analysis for Microsoft SQL
   Server, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. Pre-Migration Analysis isn't
   supported for databases connected through a JDBC driver. For more
   information on supported databases and versions, see 
   :ref:`supported-databases`.

Types of Risks
--------------

Pre-Migration Analysis groups potential risks into the following types:

- Unsupported source database features
- Data type incompatibilities
- Schema mapping risks
- Migration performance risks

After :ref:`running analysis <rm-run-app-analysis>`, the report lists each
identified risk, its severity, and suggested remediation actions.

For a list of all risks Relational Migrator reports on, see the
:ref:`Migration Risk Reference <rm-app-analysis-risk-reference>`.
