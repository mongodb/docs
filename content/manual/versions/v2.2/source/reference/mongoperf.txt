Synopsis
--------

:binary:`~bin.mongoperf` is a utility to check disk I/O performance
independently of MongoDB.

It times tests of random disk I/O and presents the results. You can
use :binary:`~bin.mongoperf` for any case apart from MongoDB. The
:setting:`~mongoperf.mmf` ``true`` mode is completely generic. In
that mode it is somewhat analogous to tools such as `bonnie++
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/bonnie/>`_ (albeit mongoperf is
simpler).

Specify options to :binary:`~bin.mongoperf` using a JavaScript document.

Options
-------

.. binary:: mongoperf

.. program:: mongoperf

.. option:: --help

   Displays the options to :binary:`~bin.mongoperf`.  Specify options to
   :binary:`~bin.mongoperf` with a JSON document described in the
   :ref:`mongoperf-fields` section.

.. option:: <jsonconfig>

   :binary:`~bin.mongoperf` accepts configuration options in the form of a
   file that holds a :term:`JSON` document. You must stream the
   content of this file into :binary:`~bin.mongoperf`, as in the following
   operation:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongoperf < config

   In this example ``config`` is the name of a file that holds a JSON
   document that resembles the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       nThreads:<n>,
       fileSizeMB:<n>,
       sleepMicros:<n>,
       mmf:<bool>,
       r:<bool>,
       w:<bool>,
       recSizeKB:<n>,
       syncDelay:<n>
     }

   See the :ref:`mongoperf-fields` section for documentation of each
   of these fields.

.. _mongoperf-fields:

Configuration Fields
--------------------

.. setting:: mongoperf.nThreads

   *Type:* Integer.

   *Default:* 1

   Defines the number of threads :binary:`~bin.mongoperf` will use in the
   test. To saturate your system's storage system you will need
   multiple threads. Consider setting :setting:`~mongoperf.nThreads` to ``16``.

.. setting:: mongoperf.fileSizeMB

   *Type:* Integer.

   *Default:* 1 megabyte (i.e. 1024\ :sup:`2` bytes)

   Test file size.

.. setting:: mongoperf.sleepMicros

   *Type:* Integer.

   *Default:* 0

   :binary:`~bin.mongoperf` will pause for the number of specified
   :setting:`~mongoperf.sleepMicros` divided by the
   :setting:`~mongoperf.nThreads` between each operation.

.. setting:: mongoperf.mmf

   *Type:* Boolean.

   *Default:* ``false``

   Set :setting:`~mongoperf.mmf` to ``true`` to use memory mapped
   files for the tests.

   Generally:

   - when :setting:`~mongoperf.mmf` is ``false``, :binary:`~bin.mongoperf`
     tests direct, physical, I/O, without caching. Use a large file
     size to test heavy random I/O load and to avoid I/O coalescing.

   - when :setting:`mongoperf.mmf` is ``true``, :binary:`~bin.mongoperf`
     runs tests of the caching system, and can use normal file system
     cache. Use :binary:`~bin.mmf` in this mode to test file system cache
     behavior with memory mapped files.

.. setting:: mongoperf.r

   *Type:* Boolean.

   *Default:* ``false``

   Set :setting:`~mongoperf.r` to ``true`` to perform reads as part of
   the tests.

   Either :setting:`~mongoperf.r` or :setting:`~mongoperf.w` must be ``true``.

.. setting:: mongoperf.w

   *Type:* Boolean.

   *Default:* ``false``

   Set :setting:`~mongoperf.w` to ``true`` to perform writes as part of
   the tests.

   Either :setting:`~mongoperf.r` or :setting:`~mongoperf.w` must be ``true``.

.. setting:: mongoperf.syncDelay

   *Type:* Integer.

   *Default:* 0

   Seconds between disk flushes. :setting:`mongoperf.syncDelay` is
   similar to :option:`--syncdelay <mongod --syncdelay>` for :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

   The :setting:`~mongoperf.syncDelay` controls how frequently
   :binary:`~bin.mongoperf` performs an asynchronous disk flush of the memory
   mapped file used for testing. By default, :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   performs this operation every 60 seconds. Use
   :setting:`~mongoperf.syncDelay` to test basic system performance of
   this type of operation.

   Only use :setting:`~mongoperf.syncDelay` in conjunction with
   :setting:`~mongoperf.mmf` set to ``true``.

   The default value of ``0`` disables this.

Use
---

.. code-block:: javascript

   mongoperf < jsonconfigfile

Replace ``jsonconfigfile`` with the path to the :binary:`~bin.mongoperf`
configuration. You may also invoke :binary:`~bin.mongoperf` in the
following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   echo "{nThreads:16,fileSizeMB:1000,r:true}" | ./mongoperf

In this operation:

- :binary:`~bin.mongoperf` tests direct physical random read io's, using
  16 concurrent reader threads.

- :binary:`~bin.mongoperf`  uses a 1 gigabyte test file.

Consider using ``iostat``, as invoked in the following example to
monitor I/O performance during the test.

.. code-block:: sh

   iostat -xm 2
