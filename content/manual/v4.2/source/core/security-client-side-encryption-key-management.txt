Supported Key Management Services
---------------------------------

Client-side field level encryption requires a Key Management Service
(KMS) for accessing a Customer Master Key (CMK). MongoDB automatically
encrypts data encryption keys using the specified CMK during 
:doc:`data encryption key creation 
</reference/method/KeyVault.createKey>`. 

Deleting the CMK renders all data encryption keys encrypted with that
CMK as permanently unreadable, which in turn renders all values
encrypted with those data encryption keys as permanently unreadable.

Client-side field level encryption supports the following KMS providers:

- :ref:`Amazon Web Services KMS <field-level-encryption-aws-kms>`
- :ref:`Locally Managed Keyfile <field-level-encryption-local-kms>`

.. _field-level-encryption-aws-kms:

Amazon Web Services KMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/csfle-aws-kms-4.2.0-4.2.1-broken.rst

MongoDB client-side encryption supports using the 
`Amazon Web Services Key Management Service 
<https://aws.amazon.com/kms>`__ for encrypting
and decrypting data encryption keys. Specifically, MongoDB securely
transmits the data encryption key to AWS KMS for encrypting or
decrypting using the specified Customer Master Key (CMK). The CMK never
leaves the AWS KMS. 

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell supports two methods for configuring 
access to an AWS KMS:

- Use the client-side field level encryption :ref:`command-line options 
  <mongo-client-side-field-level-encryption-options>`,

  *or*

- Use the :method:`Mongo()` constructor to create a database connection
  with the required AWS :ref:`KMS configuration options
  <ClientSideFieldLevelEncryptionOptions>`.

Configuring access to an AWS KMS requires at minimum an AWS access key
and its corresponding secret key. The IAM user associated to the access
key *must* have at least one policy with the following actions:

- ``kms:Decrypt`` 
  `(reference) 
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Decrypt.html>`__ 

- ``kms:Encrypt`` 
  `(reference) 
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_Encrypt.html>`__ 

.. admonition:: Implement Seperation of Least Privilege for KMS Access
   :class: note

   Consider configuring IAM user roles such that MongoDB has only the 
   access to the actions and resources required to function. 

   For example, the following policy JSON scopes the required actions to
   a single CMK:

   .. code-block:: json

      {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "kms:Decrypt",
                      "kms:Encrypt"
                  ],
                  "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:region:account:key/12a345b6-cd7e-8f9g-0h1i-jk23l45mn6o7"
              }
          ]
      }

For complete documentation on data encryption key management using AWS KMS, see 
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-client-side-encryption-data-keys`.

.. _field-level-encryption-local-kms:

Locally Managed Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell supports specifying a locally managed key
as a KMS using the :method:`Mongo()` constructor. The local key *must*
be a 96-byte long string.

For complete documentation on data encryption key management using a
locally managed key, see
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-client-side-encryption-data-keys`.

.. _field-level-encryption-keyvault:

Encryption Key Vault
--------------------

The key vault is a collection that stores data encryption keys for use
with client-side field level encryption. Data encryption keys are
encrypted using a Customer Master Key (CMK) managed through a supported
:ref:`Key Management System (KMS) <field-level-encryption-kms>`.

The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides helper methods for data
encryption key management:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 40

   * - Retrieving data encryption keys
     -
       - :method:`KeyVault.getKey()`
       - :method:`KeyVault.getKeys()`
       - :method:`KeyVault.getKeyByAltName()`

   * - Creating or Modifying data encryption keys
     -
      - :method:`KeyVault.createKey()`
      - :method:`KeyVault.addKeyAlternateName()`
      - :method:`KeyVault.removeKeyAlternateName()`

   * - Removing data encryption keys
       
       .. important::
          
          Removing a data encryption key renders all fields encrypted
          using that data encryption key as permanently unreadable.

     - 
      - :method:`KeyVault.deleteKey()`

Applications with :authrole:`read` access to the key vault collection
can retrieve data encryption keys by querying the collection. However,
only applications with access to the CMK used to encrypt a data
encryption key can use that key for encryption or decryption.

By default MongoDB stores the key vault collection on the connected
cluster. MongoDB also supports specifying a remote cluster as the key
vault. Applications must have access to both the remote key vault
cluster and the connection cluster to perform client-side field level
encryption operations.

Data encryption keys have the following structure:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "_id" : UUID("<string>"),
     "keyMaterial" : BinData(0,"<encrypted binary data string>"),
   	 "creationDate" : ISODate("2019-08-20T15:45:02.575Z"),
   	 "updateDate" : ISODate("2019-08-20T15:45:02.575Z"),
   	 "status" : <int>,
   	 "version" : NumberLong(0),
   	 "masterKey" : {
   	   "provider" : "<string>",
   	   "key" : "<string>",
   	   "region" : "<string>",
   	   "endpoint" : "<string>"
   	 },
   	 "keyAltNames" : [
       "<string>"
     ]
   }

Client-side field level encryption depends on uniqueness of
``keyAltNames`` values. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
:method:`KeyVault.createKey()` method creates a :ref:`unique index
<index-type-unique>` on ``keyAltNames`` if one does not exist.
Applications can use the :dbcommand:`listIndexes` command against the
key vault collection to check if the unique index exists. If the unique
index does not exist, applications *must* create it prior to performing
data encryption key management.

:doc:`/tutorial/manage-client-side-encryption-data-keys`.
