  document that represents the operation you want to resume after.

  ``resumeAfter`` is mutually exclusive with ``startAfter`` and
  ``startAtOperationTime``.

  By default, :method:`db.watch()` returns the delta of
  those fields modified by an update operation, instead of the entire
  updated document.

  Set ``fullDocument`` to ``"updateLookup"`` to direct
  :method:`db.watch()` to look up the most current 
  majority-committed version of the updated document.
  :method:`db.watch()` returns a ``fullDocument`` field with
  the document lookup in addition to the ``updateDescription`` delta.
