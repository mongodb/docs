  Running a :binary:`~bin.mongod` with the ``keyFile`` parameter enforces both 
  :doc:`/core/security-internal-authentication` and 
  :doc:`/core/authorization`.

  Start *each* :binary:`~bin.mongod` in the replica set using either 
  a configuration file or the command line.

  - pre: |
      **Configuration File**
      
      If using a configuration file, set the :setting:`security.keyFile` option
      to the keyfile's path, the :setting:`replication.replSetName` to the 
      desired name of the replica set, and the :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` 
      option to ``shardsvr``.

       Start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` specifying the ``--config`` option
       and the path to the configuration file.

    code: |
       mongod --config <path-to-config-file>
  - pre: |
      **Command Line**
      
      If using the command line option, when starting the component, specify 
      the ``--keyFile``, ``replSet``, and ``--shardsvr`` parameters, as in the
      following example:
    language: sh
    code: |
       mongod --keyFile <path-to-keyfile> --shardsvr --replSet <replSetName>  --dbpath <path>

  The shard-local cluster administrator user has the
  :authrole:`clusterAdmin` role, which provides privileges that allow
  access to replication operations.
