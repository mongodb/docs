Overview
--------

This tutorial explains how to add an additional member to an
existing replica set.

Before adding a new member, see the
:ref:`replica-set-admin-procedure-add-member`
topic in the :doc:`/administration/replica-sets` document.

For background on replication deployment patterns, see the
:doc:`/administration/replica-set-architectures` document.

Requirements
------------

#. An active replica set.

#. A new MongoDB system capable of supporting your dataset, accessible by
   the active replica set through the network.

If neither of these conditions are satisfied, please use the MongoDB
:ref:`installation tutorial <tutorials-installation>` and the
:doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set` tutorial instead.

Procedures
----------

.. _procedure-assumption-add-member-rs:

The examples in this procedure use the following
configuration:

- The active replica set is ``rs0``.

- The new member to be added is ``mongodb3.example.net``.

- The :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance default port is ``27017``.

- The ``mongodb.conf`` configuration file exists in the ``/etc``
  directory and contains the following replica set information:

.. code-block:: cfg

   port = 27017

   bind_ip = 10.8.0.10

   dbpath = /srv/mongodb/db0

   logpath = /var/log/mongodb.log

   fork = true

   replSet = rs0

For more information on configuration options, see
:doc:`/reference/configuration-options`.

.. _replica-set-add-member:

Add a Member to an Existing Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure uses the above :ref:`example configuration <procedure-assumption-add-member-rs>`.

1. Deploy a new :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, specifying the name of the
   replica set. You can do this one of two ways:

   - Using the ``mongodb.conf`` file. On the :term:`primary`, issue a
     command that resembles the following:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf

   - Using command line arguments. On the :term:`primary`, issue command
     that resembles the following:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongod --dbpath /srv/mongodb/db0 --replSet rs0

   Replace ``/srv/mongodb/db0`` with the path of your
   :setting:`dbpath`.

   Take note of the host name and port information for the new
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

#. Open a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected to the replica set's primary:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo

   .. note::

      The primary is the only member that can add or remove members from
      the replica set. If you do not know which member is the primary,
      log into any member of the replica set using :binary:`~bin.mongo` and
      issue the :method:`db.isMaster()` command to determine which
      member is in the :data:`isMaster.primary` field. For example, on
      the system shell:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo mongodb0.example.net

      Then in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.isMaster()

      If you are not connected to the primary, disconnect from the
      current client and reconnect to the primary.

#. In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, issue the following command to add
   the new member to the replica set.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.add("mongodb3.example.net")

   .. note::

      You can also include the port number, depending on your setup:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.add("mongodb3.example.net:27017")

#. Verify that the member is now part of the replica set by
   calling the :method:`rs.conf()` method,
   which displays the :doc:`replica set configuration </reference/replica-configuration>`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.conf()

   You can use the :method:`rs.status()` function to provide an
   overview of :doc:`replica set status </reference/replica-status>`.

.. _replica-set-add-member-alternate-procedure:

Add a Member to an Existing Replica Set (Alternate Procedure)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternately, you can add a member to a replica set by specifying an
entire configuration document with some or all of the fields in a
:data:`~local.system.replset.members` sub-documents. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.add({_id: 1, host: "mongodb3.example.net:27017", priority: 0, hidden: true})

This configures a :term:`hidden member` that is accessible at
``mongodb3.example.net:27017``. See :data:`host
<local.system.replset.members[n].host>`, :data:`priority
<local.system.replset.members[n].priority>`, and :data:`hidden
<local.system.replset.members[n].hidden>` for more information about
these settings. When you specify a full configuration object with
:method:`rs.add()`, you must declare the ``_id`` field, which is not
automatically populated in this case.

Production Notes
----------------

- In production deployments you likely want to use and configure a
  :term:`control script` to manage this process based on this command.

- A member can be removed from a set and re-added later. If the
  removed member's data is still relatively fresh, it can recover and
  catch up from its old data set. See the :method:`rs.add()` and
  :method:`rs.remove()` helpers.

- If you have a backup or snapshot of an existing member, you can move
  the data files (i.e. ``/data/db`` or :setting:`dbpath`) to a new
  system and use them to quickly initiate a new member. These files
  must be:

  - clean: the existing dataset must be from a consistent copy of the
    database from a member of the same replica set. See the
    :doc:`/administration/backups` document for more information.

  - recent: the copy must more recent than the oldest operation in the
    :term:`primary` member's :term:`oplog`. The new secondary must be
    able to become current using operations from the primary's oplog.

- There is a maximum of seven :ref:`voting members
  <replica-set-election-internals>` in any replica set. When adding
  more members to a replica set that already has seven votes, you must
  either:

  - add the new member as a :ref:`non-voting members
    <replica-set-non-voting-members>` or,

  - remove votes from an :data:`existing member <local.system.replset.members[n].votes>`.
