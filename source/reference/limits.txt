=============================
MongoDB Limits and Thresholds
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

This document provides a collection of hard and soft limitations of
the MongoDB system.

Limits
------

BSON Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _limit-bson-document-size:
.. limit:: BSON Document Size

   .. include:: /includes/fact-document-max-size.rst

.. _limit-nested-depth:
.. limit:: Nested Depth for BSON Documents

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2

   MongoDB supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for :term:`BSON
   documents <document>`.

Namespaces
~~~~~~~~~~

.. _limit-namespace-length:
.. limit:: Namespace Length

   Each namespace, including database and collection name, must be
   shorter than 123 bytes.

   .. fix when we know what the actual limit is.

.. _limit-number-of-namespaces:
.. limit:: Number of Namespaces

   The limitation on the number of namespaces is the size of the
   namespace file divided by 628.

   A 16 megabyte namespace file can support approximately 24,000
   namespaces. Each index also counts as a namespace.

.. _limit-size-of-namespace-file:
.. limit:: Size of Namespace File

   Namespace files can be no larger than 2047 megabytes.

   By default namespace files are 16 megabytes. You can configure the
   size using the :setting:`nssize` option.

Indexes
~~~~~~~

.. _limit-index-size:
.. limit:: Index Size

   The total size of an indexed value must be *less than* 1024
   bytes. MongoDB will not add that value to an index if it is longer
   than 1024 bytes.

.. _limit-number-of-indexes-per-collection:
.. limit:: Number of Indexes per Collection

   A single collection can have *no more* than 64 indexes.

.. _limit-index-name-length:
.. limit:: Index Name Length

   The names of indexes, including their namespace (i.e database and
   collection name) cannot be longer than 128 characters. The default
   index name is the concatenation of the field names and index
   directions.

   You can explicitly specify an index name to the
   :method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` helper if the default index
   name is too long.

.. _limit-sharding-unique-indexes:
.. limit:: Unique Indexes in Sharded Collections

   MongoDB does not support unique indexes across shards, except when
   the unique index contains the full shard key as a prefix of the
   index. In these situations MongoDB will enforce uniqueness across
   the full key, not a single field.

   .. see:: :doc:`/tutorial/enforce-unique-keys-for-sharded-collections`
      for an alternate approach.

.. limit:: Number of Indexed Fields in a Compound Index

   There can be no more than 31 fields in a compound index.

Capped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. limit:: Maximum Number of Documents in a Capped Collection

   .. versionchanged:: 2.4

   If you specify a maximum number of documents for a capped
   collection using the ``max`` parameter to
   :dbcommand:`create`, the limit must be less than 2\ :sup:`32`
   documents. If you do not specify a maximum number of documents when
   creating a capped collection, there is no limit on the number of
   documents.

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. limit:: Number of Members of a Replica Set

   Replica sets can have no more than 12 members.

.. limit:: Number of Voting Members of a Replica Set

   Only 7 members of a replica set can have votes at any given
   time. See can vote :ref:`replica-set-non-voting-members` for more information

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _limit-sharding-limitations:
.. limit:: Operations Unavailable in Sharded Environments

   The :dbcommand:`group` does not work with sharding. Use
   :dbcommand:`mapReduce` or :dbcommand:`aggregate` instead.

   :method:`db.eval()` is incompatible with sharded collections. You may
   use :method:`db.eval()` with un-sharded collections in a shard
   cluster.

   :operator:`$where` does not permit references to the ``db`` object
   from the :operator:`$where` function. This is uncommon in
   un-sharded collections.

   The :operator:`$isolated` update modifier does not work in sharded
   environments.

   :operator:`$snapshot` queries do not work in sharded environments.

.. limit:: Sharding Existing Collection Data Size

   When enabling sharding on an existing collection, MongoDB imposes a
   maximum size on those collections to ensure that its possible to
   create chunks. The precise size of the limitation is a function of
   the chunk size and the data size: *MongoDB supports sharding all
   collections smaller than 256 gigabytes.* You may be able to enable
   sharding for existing collections between 256 and 400 gigabytes in
   size, depending on the distribution of document sizes.

   .. note::

      This limitation *only* applies to sharding collections that have
      existing data sets, and is *not* a limit on the size of a
      sharded collection.

.. seealso:: :limit:`Unique Indexes in Sharded Collections`

Operations
~~~~~~~~~~

.. _limit-sort:
.. limit:: Sorted Documents

   MongoDB will only return sorted results on fields without an index
   *if* the sort operation uses less than 32 megabytes of memory.

.. _limit-agg-sort:

.. limit:: Aggregation Sort Operation

   .. include:: /includes/fact-agg-sort-limit.rst
      :start-after: agg-sort-in-memory-limit

.. limit:: 2d Geospatial queries cannot use the $or operator

   .. see:: :operator:`$or` and :doc:`/core/geospatial-indexes`.

.. limit:: Spherical Polygons must fit within a hemisphere.

   .. |geo-operator-method| replace:: :operator:`$geoIntersects` or :operator:`$geoWithin`

   .. include:: /includes/fact-geometry-hemisphere-limitation.rst

.. _limit-multiple-in:
.. limit:: Combination Limit with Multiple $in Expressions

   .. include:: /includes/fact-limits-multiple-in-expressions.rst

Naming Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. limit:: Restrictions on Database Names

   The dot (i.e. ``.``) character is not permissible in database
   names.

   Database names are case sensitive even if the underlying file
   system is case insensitive.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      For MongoDB instances running on Windows.

      In 2.2 the following characters are not permissible in database names:

      .. code-block:: none

         /\. "*<>:|?

      See :ref:`rn-2.2-database-name-restriction-windows` for more
      information on this change

.. limit:: Restriction on Collection Names

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   Collection names should begin with an underscore or a letter
   character, and *cannot*:

   - contain the ``$``.

   - be an empty string (e.g. ``""``).

   - contain the null character.

   - begin with the ``system.`` prefix. (Reserved for internal use.)

.. _limit-restrictions-on-field-names:

.. limit:: Restrictions on Field Names

   Field names cannot contain dots (i.e. ``.``), dollar signs
   (i.e. ``$``), or null characters. See
   :ref:`faq-dollar-sign-escaping` for an alternate approach.
