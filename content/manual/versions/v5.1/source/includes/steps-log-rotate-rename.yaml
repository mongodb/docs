action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongod -v --logpath /var/log/mongodb/server1.log

  You can also explicitly specify :option:`--logRotate rename
  <mongod --logRotate>`.

stepnum: 2
title: List the log files
ref: list-logfiles
pre: |
  In a separate terminal, list the matching files:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
     ls /var/log/mongodb/server1.log*
post: |
  The results should include one log file, ``server1.log``.
---
stepnum: 3
ref: rotate-log
title: Rotate the log file.
pre: |
  Rotate the log file by issuing the :dbcommand:`logRotate` command
  from the ``admin`` database in :binary:`~bin.mongosh`:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    db.adminCommand( { logRotate : server } )
post: |
  If :doc:`auditing </core/auditing>` is enabled, you can specify ``1``
  to ``logRotate`` (instead of  ``server``) to rotate both the server
  and audit logs at the same time, if desired. The audit log will be
  rotated in the same fashion as the server log, according to the
  :option:`--logRotate <mongod --logRotate>` setting.
---
stepnum: 4
ref: list-new-logfiles
title: 'View the new log files'
pre: |
  List the new log files to view the newly-created log:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    ls /var/log/mongodb/server1.log*
post: |
  There should be two log files listed: ``server1.log``, which is the
  log file that :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` made when it 
  reopened  the log file, and ``server1.log.<timestamp>``, the renamed
  original log file.
  
  Rotating log files does not modify the "old" rotated log files. When
  you rotate a log, you rename the ``server1.log`` file to include
  the timestamp, and a new, empty ``server1.log`` file receives all
  new log input.
