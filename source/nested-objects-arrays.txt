MongoDB Charts can directly access fields in nested objects and can
process array fields flexibly according to your use case.

Nested Objects
--------------

Nested objects in the :guilabel:`Fields` section of the Chart Builder
are indicated by curly brackets (``{}``) next to their name. To expand
an object field, click the arrow to the left of the field name. You can
drag nested object fields onto the desired
:ref:`encoding channels <encoding-channels>` just like any other field
to visualize those fields in your chart.

.. example::

   The ``video.movieDetails`` data source in the following example
   contains nested objects named ``awards`` and ``imdb``. We expand the
   objects by clicking the arrows to the left of their names, then in
   the bar chart we compare the
   mean ``imdb.rating`` in the :guilabel:`Y-axis` with
   ``awards.wins`` in the :guilabel:`X-axis`.

      :alt: Create chart nested object

   .. note::

      Notice the :guilabel:`filter` provided above the chart of
      ``{'awards.wins': {$gt: 0}}``, meaning only movies which have won
      at least one award are included in the visualization. For more
      information on filtering documents in MongoDB Charts, see the
      :ref:`Filter Documents <charts-filter-documents>` page.

Array Fields
------------

Array fields in the :guilabel:`Fields` section of the Chart Builder
page are indicated by square brackets (``[]``) next to their name. When
adding an array field to an :ref:`encoding channel
<encoding-channels>`, select an :guilabel:`array reduction` option to
process the data in the best way for your visualization. The following
array reduction options are available:

General Array Reduction Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can apply these array reduction options to any array:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Array Reduction Option
     - Description

   * - Unwind array
     - Deconstructs the array field from the input documents to
       output a document for *each* element. Each output document is
       a copy of the input document with the value of the array field
       replaced by the element.

   * - Array length
     - Counts and returns the total number of items in the array.

   * - Array element by index
     - Returns the array element at the specified zero-based index position.

String Accumulates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can apply these accumulates to arrays of String values:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Accumulate
     - Description

   * - concat
     - Concatenates the values of the array into a a single string.

   * - min length
     - Returns the length of the shortest string in the array.

   * - max length
     - Returns the length of the longest string in the array.

   * - longest
     - Returns the longest string in the array.

   * - shortest
     - Returns the shortest string in the array.

   * - existence of value
     - Returns ``true`` if the specified string exists in the array,
       and ``false`` if the string does not exist in the array.

   * - count of occurrences
     - Returns the number of times the specified string occurs in the
       array.

Numeric Accumulates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can apply these accumulates to arrays of Numeric values:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Accumulate
     - Description

   * - min
     - Returns the minimum value in the array.

   * - max
     - Returns the maximum value in the array.

   * - mean
     - Returns the mean of all values in the array.

   * - sum
     - Returns the sum of all values in the array.

.. note::

   MongoDB Charts only displays accumulate options which match the data
   type of the field used in the visualization (i.e., only showing
   string accumulate options for string data and numeric accumulate
   options for numeric data).

Fields within an Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with array-valued fields, :ref:`encoding channels
<encoding-channels>` require an array reduction option to be specified
when handling fields *within* an array. In this case, the selected
reduction is applied to the array containing the target field.
Additionally, in the case of nested arrays, you must select a reduction
option for the top-level array and all sub-arrays. Note that different
reduction options may be used for each nested array.
