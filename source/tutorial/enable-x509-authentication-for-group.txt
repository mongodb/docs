Overview

.. next paragraph stolenish from the MongoDB Manual

MongoDB supports x.509 client and member certificate authentication for use
with a secure :doc:`TLS/SSL connection </tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment>`. 
The x.509 authentication allows users and other members to authenticate to
servers with certificates rather than with a username and password.

.. note::
   As of |mms| 2.0, using x.509 certificates for membership authentication is supported.

Procedures
----------

These procedures describe how to configure and enable x.509 authentication
when using Automation. If |mms| does *not* manage your Monitoring or Backup
agents, you must manually configure them to use x.509 authentication.

.. note::
   See 
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-x509` and
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-x509` for instructions.

Prepare an Existing Deployment for x.509 Certificate Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::
   X.509 Client Certificate authentication requires SSL. If |mms| manages 
   one or more existing deployments, SSL must be enabled on each process in 
   the MongoDB deployment before enabling x.509 authentication.

.. note::
   If SSL is already enabled, you may skip this procedure.

Configure an Existing Deployment for x.509 Member Certificate Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
   This procedure is optional. It enables members of a replica set or sharded cluster to also use x.509 certificates to authenticate each other. If it is not configured, replica set and sharded cluster members can still authenticate with each other using `keyFile` authentication.

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-members-for-x509.rst


When you have configured the SSL options for each deployed process, you can
proceed to enable x.509 authentication for your |mms| group.
