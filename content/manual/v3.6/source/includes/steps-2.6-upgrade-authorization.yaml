      character: "'"
    pre: |
      For a sharded cluster, :dbcommand:`authSchemaUpgrade` will
      upgrade the authorization data of the shards as well and the
      upgrade is complete. You can,  however, override this behavior by
      including ``upgradeShards: false`` in the command, as in the
      following example:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      db.adminCommand({authSchemaUpgrade: 1,
      upgradeShards: false });
    post: |
      If you override the behavior, after running
      :dbcommand:`authSchemaUpgrade` on a :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance,
      you will need to connect to the primary for each shard and
      repeat the upgrade process after upgrading on the
      :binary:`~bin.mongos`.
