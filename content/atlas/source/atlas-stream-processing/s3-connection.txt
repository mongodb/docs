Add an {+aws+} S3 Connection
--------------------------------------------------------------

To add an S3 connection to your {+spi+}'s connection registry:

.. composable-tutorial::
   :options: interface
   :defaults: atlas-ui

   .. selected-content::
      :selections: atlas-cli

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

	 .. step:: Set up Unified AWS Access.

	    Follow the procedure described in `Set Up Unified AWS
	    Access
	    <https://docs.mongodb.com/atlas/security/set-up-unified-aws-access/?interface=atlas-admin-api>`__.

	    Ensure that you grant your IAM role ``ListAllMyBuckets`` and
	    ``PutObject`` permissions.

	    Note the ARN value in ``Statement.Principal.AWS`` for later in this
	    procedure.

	 .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-project-access-manager

	 .. step:: Create an API key.

	    The :oas-atlas-tag:`Create One Connection
	    </Streams/operation/createStreamConnection>` API endpoint
	    requires digest authorization when creating an S3 Connection. To
	    support this, you must create an API Key.

	    a. In the :guilabel:`Project Access Manager`, select the
	       :guilabel:`Applications` tab, then click :guilabel:`API Keys`.

	    b. Click :guilabel:`Create API Key`. Provide a short description
	       for the key.

	    c. In the :guilabel:`Project Permissions` dropdown menu,
	       select both the :guilabel:`Project Stream Processing Owner` and
	       :guilabel:`Project Owner` roles. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

	    d. Save both the public and private keys for later in this procedure.

         .. step:: Create the S3 connection.

            .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-streams-connections-create.rst

            In your configuration file, set the following key-value pairs:

	    .. list-table::
	       :widths: 35 65
	       :header-rows: 1

	       * - Key
		 - Value

	       * - ``type``
		 - ``"S3"``

	       * - ``aws.roleArn``
		 - Value of the ARN noted in an earlier step.

	    Ensure that you grant your IAM role ``ListAllMyBuckets`` and

	    d. Save both the public and private keys for later in this procedure.

	 .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-stream-processing.rst  

	 .. step:: Go to the :guilabel:`Connection Registry`.  

	    a. Locate the overview panel of the {+spi+} you want to  
	       modify and click :guilabel:`Configure`.  

	    #. Select the :guilabel:`Connection Registry` tab.  

	 .. step:: Click :guilabel:`+ Add connection`.  

	 .. step:: Add a new connection.  

	    a. Select an :guilabel:`S3` connection.  

	    #. Provide a :guilabel:`Connection Name`. Each connection
	       name must be unique within a {+spi+}.  This is the name
	       used to reference the connection in {+atlas-sp+}
	       :ref:`aggregations <stream-aggregation>`.

            #. From the :guilabel:`AWS IAM Role ARN` drodpwon, select
               the ARN of the unified access role you authorized in a
               prior step.

            #. Click :guilabel:`Add connection`.

   .. selected-content::

	    Follow the procedure described in `Set Up Unified AWS
	    Access
	    <https://docs.mongodb.com/atlas/security/set-up-unified-aws-access/?interface=atlas-admin-api>`__.

	    Ensure that you grant your IAM role ``ListAllMyBuckets`` and

	    d. Save both the public and private keys for later in this procedure.

	 .. step:: Create the S3 Connection.

	    The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides an endpoint to
	    :oas-atlas-tag:`Create One Connection
	    </Streams/operation/createStreamConnection>`. You must send this
	    request using digest authorization.

	    In your HTTP request interface, enable digest authorization. For
	    the ``username``, provide the public key you generated
	    previously. For the ``password``, provide the private key you
	    generated previously.

	    For an {+aws+} |s3| connection, set the following key-value pairs:

	    .. list-table::
	       :widths: 35 65
	       :header-rows: 1

	       * - Key
		 - Value

	       * - ``type``
		 - ``"S3"``

	       * - ``aws.roleArn``
		 - Value of the ARN noted in an earlier step.

Supported Aggregation Behavior
------------------------------

{+aws+} |s3| sink connections support only the ``$emit`` stage, not
the ``$merge`` stage. For more information, see :ref:`$emit
<atlas-sp-agg-emit>`.
