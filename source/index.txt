The {+intellij-full+} is designed to improve the development experience 
for Java developers working with IntelliJ IDEA. The {+intellij-short+} builds on 
the existing IntelliJ Database Explorer to streamline the process of writing 
and managing MongoDB queries directly within the IDE. The {+intellij-short+} 
supports the :driver:`MongoDB Java driver </java/>` and `Spring Data MongoDB 
<https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/reference/index.html>`_.

You can use the {+intellij-short+} to:

- Connect to your MongoDB instance and interact with your data. 

- Write, test, and iterate Java queries faster.  

- Identify query and data modeling anti-patterns in your application code.

Features 
--------

The {+intellij-short+} currently supports the following features:

- :ref:`Autocomplete <intellij-autocomplete>` for database, collection, and 
  document field names. 
- :ref:`Database reference validation <intellij-db-reference-validation>`.
- :ref:`Type validation <intellij-type-validation>` of document fields.
- :ref:`Missing index warnings <intellij-index-warning>` for Java queries.
- :ref:`Run Java Queries <intellij-run-java-queries>` directly in the
  Database Explorer Playgrounds.
