Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) Changes
--------------------------------------------

|sca| is a new European regulatory requirement to reduce fraud and make
online payments more secure. All payment service providers are required
to build additional authentication into their checkout flow once |sca|
goes into effect. Customers in European Economic Area (EEA) may be
required to authenticate their credit cards depending on the card's
issuer, starting September 14, 2019. If your credit card issuer
requires authentication, review the following :ref:`sca-auth-process` to
continue paying for |service-fullname| seamlessly with a credit card.

Marketing emails will be sent out to affected customers announcing the
policy change and the steps necessary to comply with |sca|.

.. _sca-auth-process:

Authentication Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections cover different ways to authenticate your credit
card to comply with Strong Customer Authentication.

Build a Paid Cluster as a New User
``````````````````````````````````

New |service| users who do not have a payment method saved can
authenticate a new credit card when paying for a cluster on the
:guilabel:`Create a Cluster` page. To learn more, see
:ref:`Create a New Cluster <create-new-cluster>`.

Edit Payment Method
```````````````````

Existing users can edit their :guilabel:`Payment Method` to authenticate
a new credit card or reauthenticate an existing credit card to
comply with |sca|:

1. Select the desired organization from the :guilabel:`Context`
   dropdown.

#. From the left-hand navigation pane, click :guilabel:`Billing`.

#. Locate the :guilabel:`Payment Method` section on the right-hand side,
   then click the :guilabel:`Edit`.

#. Update the :guilabel:`Billing Address` associated with the credit
   card and enter the :guilabel:`Credit Card` information.

Once you update your credit card information and authenticate, you will
be automatically charged for all existing failed payments.

Failed Payment Email
````````````````````

|service| sends an email after a payment failure with a link to your
invoices. Existing users can authenticate a credit card when retrying a
failed payment. To retry the failed payment from the failed payment
email:

1. Follow the link in the failed payment email.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Invoice Date` of the failed invoice.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Payments` section, click :guilabel:`Retry` next
   to the failed payment.

Retry Failed Payment
`````````````````````

Existing users can authenticate a credit card when retrying a failed
payment. To retry the failed payment from within |service|:

1. Select the desired organization from the :guilabel:`Context`
   dropdown.

#. From the left-hand navigation pane, click :guilabel:`Billing`.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Usage History` tab.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Invoice Date` of the failed invoice.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Payments` section, click :guilabel:`Retry` next
   to the failed payment.

.. _vat-id-number:

VAT ID Number
-------------

If your organization's billing or invoice address is in a country that
is a member of the European Union, add your :abbr:`VAT (Value Added
Tax)` ID number on the :guilabel:`Payment Method` or the
:guilabel:`Billing Profile` dialog.

|service| displays the VAT field only if you select a country other than
the United States.
