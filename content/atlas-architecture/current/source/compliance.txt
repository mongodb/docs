Certifications and Compliance with Regulations
----------------------------------------------

To help you address security and privacy requirements, MongoDB {+service+}
aims to deliver the highest levels of standards conformance and regulatory
compliance.

{+service+} data platform undergoes rigorous independent audits to verify
its security, privacy, and organizational controls. These audits help ensure
that the platform  meets compliance and regulatory requirements, including
those specific to highly-regulated industries.

{+service+} has ISO/IEC 27001 and 9001, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP, and
several other certifications. The full list of certifications is included
in this section.

These certifications mean you can configure {+service+} to comply with a 
particular standard. Be sure to follow the recommended settings for the 
standard to ensure compliance.

{+service+} maintains the following certifications:

- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**: Global standard for information security management systems.
- **ISO/IEC 27017:2015**: Global standard for cloud-specific security controls.
- **ISO/IEC 27018:2019**: Global standard for protecting sensitive data (PII) on the cloud.
- **ISO 9001:2015**: Globally recognized standard for Quality Management.
- **PCI DSS**: Requirements for processing and accessing credit card data.
- **HIPAA**: U.S. privacy regulation safeguarding health information.
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation in the EU and EEA.
- **IRAP**: Australian government cybersecurity assessment framework.
- **TX-RAMP**: Texas Risk and Authorization Management Program.
- **TISAX**: Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange for automotive industries.
- **HDS**: French standard for hosting health data (Hébergeur de Données de Santé).

.. _arch-center-compliance-encryption:

Encryption
----------

You can implement encryption to ensure data security and compliance across all
stages of data handling. Encryption is one of the most common requirements for 
ensuring compliance with certain standards and {+service+} offers a robust set 
of encryption options to satisfy the requirements.

- By default, |service| encrypts data in transit. To ensure data privacy and
  regulatory compliance, |service| requires |tls-ssl| to encrypt the connections
  to your databases.

- By default, |service| encrypts all data at rest using 
  `cloud provider disk encryption <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-kms-encryption/>`__. When using {+service+} cloud backups,
  |service| uses |AES-256|
  encryption to encrypt all data stored in |s3| buckets in your |service|
  {+database-deployments+}.
  In addition, |service| supports using |aws| |kms|, |akv|, and |gcp| to
  encrypt storage engines and cloud provider backups. To learn more, see
  :atlas:`Encryption at Rest using your Key Management 
  <security-kms-encryption>`. 

- You can use :manual:`Queryable Encryption </core/queryable-encryption/>`
  to secure queries on encrypted data on select, sensitive fields 
  in a document stored on MongoDB. With Queryable Encryption, sensitive
  information remains protected even when users run queries on data.

  Use  well-researched non-deterministic encryption schemes to maintain
  a balance between security and functionality.

  With {+qe+}, you can perform the following tasks:

  - Encrypt sensitive data fields from the client-side.
  - Store sensitive data fields as fully randomized encrypted data on the database 
    {+cluster+}-side, run with {+service+}.
  - Run expressive queries on the encrypted data.

  MongoDB completes these tasks without the server having knowledge of the data
  it's processing.

  When using Queryable Encryption, sensitive data is encrypted throughout its 
  lifecycle: in transit, at rest, in use,
  in logs, and backups. The data is only ever decrypted on the client-side,
  since only you have access to the encryption keys.

  You can set up {+qe+} using the following mechanisms:

  - :manual:`Automatic Encryption </core/queryable-encryption/>`
    enables you to perform encrypted read and write operations without
    having to add explicit calls to encrypt and decrypt fields. We recommend automatic encryption in most situations, as it streamlines the process of writing your client application. With automatic encryption, MongoDB automatically encrypts and decrypts fields in read and write operations.
  - :manual:`Explicit Encryption </core/queryable-encryption/fundamentals/manual-encryption/>` enables
    you to perform encrypted read and write operations through your MongoDB
    driver's encryption library. You must specify the logic for encryption
    with this library throughout your application. Explicit encryption provides fine-grained control over security, at the cost of increased complexity when configuring collections and writing code for MongoDB Drivers. With explicit encryption, you specify how to encrypt fields in your document for each operation you perform on the database, and you include this logic throughout your application.

    To learn more, see :manual:`Use Explicit Encryption </core/queryable-encryption/tutorials/explicit-encryption/>`.

.. _arch-center-compliance-data-sovereignty:

Data Sovereignty
----------------

{+service+} supports over 110+ regions across |aws|, |azure|, and |gcp|. 
This global distribution of supported locations ensures that you can 
provision clusters and store data that complies with your data sovereignty 
and compliance requirements. Understanding the data sovereignty requirements 
for any application being built on {+service+} is necessary to ensure you 
stay compliant with proper governance. Additionally, {+service+} simplifies 
data sovereignty compliance through global {+clusters+} with zoned sharding.

You can use global {+clusters+} to control data storage locations. You can
partition and store data in your database into distinct zones, each situated
in a different geographical location. For example, you can store European
customer data in Europe, while storing U.S. customer data in the U.S.
This allows you to comply with data sovereignty regulations and reduces
latency for users accessing data from their respective regions. To learn
more, see :atlas:`Global Clusters </global-clusters>`.

.. _arch-center-compliance-backup-distribution:

Backup Snapshot Distribution
----------------------------

You can distribute backup snapshots and oplog data across multiple regions.
For example, you can satisfy compliance requirements and store backups in
different geographical locations to ensure disaster recovery
in case of regional outages. To learn more, see :atlas:`Snapshot Distribution </backup/cloud-backup/snapshot-distribution/>`.

.. _arch-center-compliance-backup-compliance-policy:

Backup Compliance Policy
------------------------

You can use |bcp| in {+service+} to secure business-critical data. You can prevent
all backup snapshots and oplog data stored in {+service+} from being modified
or deleted for a predefined retention period by any user, regardless of their
{+service+} role.

This guarantees that your backups are fully WORM (Write Once Read Many)-compliant.
Only a designated, authorized
user can turn off this protection after completing a verification
process with MongoDB support and legal. This adds a mandatory manual 
delay and cooldown period so that an attacker cannot change the backup 
policy and export the data. To learn more, see :atlas:`Configure a Backup Compliance Policy </backup/cloud-backup/backup-compliance-policy/>`.
