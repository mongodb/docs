The |k8s-op| provides a container image for the {+mdbagent+} in |onprem|. This
allows you to manage and deploy MongoDB database clusters with full monitoring,
backups, and automation provided by |onprem|.

The |k8s| container serves as a host on which |onprem| orchestrates the
installation of |mongod| processes and deploys the cluster configuration.

As part of deployment, the |k8s-op-short| creates |k8s-pvs| for
the |onprem| StatefulSets. The |k8s| container uses |k8s-pvs| to maintain the cluster state
between restarts.

The |k8s-op-short| architecture consists of:

- **An Ops Manager custom resource**. Through this resource, the |k8s-op-short|
  deploys |onprem| components: the application database, the |onprem|
  application, and the Backup Daemon in the |k8s| containers. After the deployment
  is operational, the |onprem| components reconcile updates that you make to
  the MongoDB cluster configuration. To learn more, see :ref:`meko-om-arch`.
  
- **MongoDB database custom resources**. The |k8s-op-short| deploys the ``MongoDB``
  database and the ``MongoDBUser`` |k8s-custom-resources|. After the deployment is
  operational, these resources reconcile updates that you make to the
  user or the MongoDB cluster configuration. To learn more, see :ref:`mdb-resources-arch`.
