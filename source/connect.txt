This page outlines how to use |vcse| to connect to a
MongoDB host. You can connect to a standalone, replica set,
or sharded cluster host.

.. admonition:: MongoDB Atlas
   :class: note

   If you need to create a MongoDB host, consider using 
   `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_vsce>`__.
   Atlas is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service which requires no 
   installation, offers a free tier to get started, and provides a 
   copyable URI to easily connect |vsce| to your deployment.

If you need to install |vsce|, see :ref:`vsce-install` for instructions.

Considerations
--------------

- When connecting |vsce| to a replica set, use either the
  replica set :guilabel:`SRV record` or :guilabel:`Replica Set Name`
  when filling in your connection information. It is not recommended to
  connect directly to an individual replica set member.

  - If the member to which you are connected switches from a
    :manual:`primary </core/replica-set-primary/>` member to a
    :manual:`secondary </core/replica-set-secondary/>` or vice versa as
    the result of an election, |vsce| may either forcibly close
    the connection or display stale data.

- You can't connect |vsce| directly to an :atlas:`analytics node 
  <faq/#what-are-analytics-nodes>`.

- |vsce| appends the ``appName`` connection string option with a value
  of ``mongodb-vscode <version>`` for all deployment connections.

.. - If you are using Kerberos as your authentication mechanism, do not 
..  specify the :guilabel:`Password` in the connection form.

.. _vsce-connect-task:

Create a Connection to a Deployment
-----------------------------------

|vsce| provides two methods to create a connection to a deployment. You 
can: 

- Provide a deployment connection string, or 
- Fill in a deployment information in specific fields.

Providing a connection string is faster and easier than filling in a 
deployment's details. Use this option if |service| hosts your 
deployment or if you have a connection string for a deployment 
available.

Define how your connection is saved with the
:guilabel:`Default Connection Saving Location`
:ref:`setting <vsce-settings>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40

   * - Setting
     - Description

   * - ``Global``
     - Save your connection globally in VS Code, so it can be accessed
       from any workspace.

   * - ``Workspace``
     - Save your connection in your workspace. You cannot
       access the connection from a different workspace.

   * - ``Session``
     - Save the connection for only this VS Code session. The connection
       is lost when you close VS Code.

   .. tab:: Paste Connection String
      :tabid: paste-connection-string

      When you provide a connection string, |vsce| supports
      most :manual:`Connection String Options
      </reference/connection-string/#connection-string-options>`
      supported by MongoDB.

.. _vsce-activate-connection:

Activate a Connection 
---------------------

You can connect |vsce| to only one deployment at a time. To change the
active connection to a different deployment, or to connect to a 
deployment from which you were disconnected:

.. include:: /includes/steps/activate-connection.rst

.. _vsce-disconnect-task:

Disconnect from a Deployment
----------------------------

|vsce| provides two methods to disconnect from a deployment. You can:

- Disconnect with the Command Palette, or
- Disconnect from the :guilabel:`MongoDB` view in the 
  :guilabel:`Activity Bar`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Disconnect with the Command Palette
      :tabid: command-palette

      .. include:: /includes/steps/disconnect-command-palette.rst

   .. tab:: Disconnect from the MongoDB View
      :tabid: mdb-view

      .. include:: /includes/steps/disconnect-mongodb-view.rst

Disconnecting from a MongoDB instance closes the |vsce| connection to 
the active instance. You must :ref:`reconnect <vsce-connect-task>` to 
interact with data in your deployment again.

Remove a Connection
-------------------

|vsce| provides two methods to remove a connection to a deployment from
|vscode-short|. You can:

- Remove a connection with the Command Palette, or
- Remove a connection from the :guilabel:`MongoDB` view in the 
  :guilabel:`Activity Bar`.

.. important::

   Removing a connection from |vscode-short| removes it both from the 
   current workspace and from |vscode-short| globally.
