Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
of this document.

Downgrade Path
--------------

.. include:: /includes/3.4-downgrade-path.rst

Create Backup
-------------

*Optional but Recommended.*  Create a backup of your database.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before downgrading the binaries, you must downgrade the feature
compatibility version and remove any :ref:`3.4 features incompatible
<3.4-compatibility-enabled>` with 3.2 or earlier versions as generally
outlined below. These steps are necessary only if
``featureCompatibilityVersion`` has ever been set  to ``"3.4"``.

.. |fcv| replace:: :ref:`Feature Compatibility Version to "3.2"
   <3.4-downgrade-feature-compatibility-rs>`
   
.. |target| replace:: primary

.. _3.4-downgrade-feature-compatibility-rs:

1. Downgrade Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary.

#. .. include:: /includes/extracts/3.4-downgrade-feature-compatibility.rst

2. Remove Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have defined any views, drop the views before downgrading
MongoDB 3.4 to 3.2.

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary.

#. .. include:: /includes/extracts/3.4-downgrade-views.rst

3. Remove Collation Option from Collections and Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have defined any non-"simple" collation for a collection or an
index, remove the collection or index before downgrading MongoDB 3.4 to
3.2.

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary.

#. .. include:: /includes/extracts/3.4-downgrade-collation-collections.rst

#. .. include:: /includes/extracts/3.4-downgrade-collation-indexes.rst

4. Convert Data of Type Decimal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary.

#. .. include:: /includes/extracts/3.4-downgrade-decimal.rst

5. Downgrade Index Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have ``v: 2`` indexes (i.e. the default version for indexes
created in MongoDB 3.4 if ``featureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4"``),
:method:`reindex the collection <db.collection.reIndex()>` to recreate
all indexes on the collection as ``v: 1`` before downgrading MongoDB.

#. Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary.

#. .. include:: /includes/extracts/3.4-downgrade-v2-indexes.rst

Repeat the process on secondary members of the replica set as the
reindex operation does not propagate to the secondaries.

.. tip::

   If connecting a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to a secondary member, set
   :method:`rs.slaveOk()`.
