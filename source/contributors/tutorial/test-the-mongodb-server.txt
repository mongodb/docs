As you work, you should periodically run the existing test suites to
ensure that you have not unintentionally broken anything. If you intend
to make a change that will break an existing test, update the test
appropriately.

We have three main "categories" of tests [#style-checking]_: 

- JavaScript tests for `integration
  testing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing>`_.
   
- (new-style) C++ unit tests for `unit tests
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing>`_.

- (old-style) C++ dbtests for `unit tests
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing>`_. Avoid writing new
  dbtests whenever possible as we are moving towards deprecating and
  deleting all dbtests in favor of unit tests.

When changing a component of the codebase, you will likely want to run
a combination of the C++ and JavaScript tests.

For more information on writing your own tests, refer to
:ref:`writing-tests-for-server-code`.

We suggest that you test your changes on whatever operating systems you
have access to, as we will test your patch on multiple systems before
accepting it.

.. [#style-checking] We use ``cpplint`` to perform some basic style-checking.

Running JavaScript Tests
------------------------

All JavaScript tests are in `the jstests directory
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/master/jstests>`_. These tests
exist to test the binaries as-is, rather than building new "test"
binaries. In the ``jstests`` directory, subdirectories exist for the
different test suites, grouped roughly by what they test. The
``jstests/core`` directory is the "default" directory for
general-purpose tests.

Test Using ``mongo`` Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Execute the JavaScript tests using the :program:`mongo` shell, as in:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo jstests/core/basic1.js
   mongo jstests/core/count.js

Different tests assume different environments. For instance, some tests
may require authentication and access control; others may require SSL
encrypted connections.

The :program:`mongo` shell has helpers to spawn new processes. For
example, certain JavaScript tests set up a sharded and/or replicated
environment or run other MongoDB binaries. For details, see
:ref:`writing-tests-for-server-code`.

During development, you may wish to run a small selection of tests
instead of the full suite. Often, the names of the test files can help
you determine which tests to run as the names of these files can often
indicate what they test. Alternatively, to get a targeted subset of
test files to run, you can run the following operation in the
``jstests`` directory; the ``<command>`` is the shell helper
corresponding to the code path you're changing:

.. code-block:: sh

   git grep -l <command>

.. _test-using-resmoke:

Test Using ``resmoke.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``buildscripts`` directory contains the file :file:`resmoke.py`.
With :file:`resmoke.py`, you can run a subset of the tests in
:file:`jstests/`.

For most test suites, :file:`resmoke.py` starts up an instance of
:program:`mongod`, runs the tests, and then shuts down the
:program:`mongod`. You can run :file:`resmoke.py` while running other
instances of :program:`mongod` on the same machine; :file:`resmoke.py`
will use ports in a configurable range for any :program:`mongod` instances it
starts and provide them with their own data directories.

.. note::

   - By default, :file:`resmoke.py` will use ports in the 20000+ range. If you
     have other programs running in that port range, the starting port is
     configurable via the ``--basePort`` option to :file:`resmoke.py`

   - By default, :file:`resmoke.py` will use a subdirectory of
     :file:`/data/db` for the dbpath of any :program:`mongod` processes
     it starts; this may interfere with other MongoDB instances you are
     running. To change the directory in which :file:`resmoke.py` will
     create databases, use ``--dbpathPrefix=/some/other/path``.

You must run :file:`resmoke.py` from the top-level directory of a
MongoDB source repository. At minimum, this directory must contain the
:program:`mongo` and :program:`mongod` binaries. For certain tests, you
will also need to build the tools (see
:doc:`/contributors/tutorial/build-tools-from-source`) and the
:program:`mongos` binary, and put them in this directory as well.

To run :file:`resmoke.py`, you need a recent version of `PyMongo
<http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/installation.html>`_ and `PyYaml
<http://pyyaml.org>`_.

To see the possible options for :file:`resmoke.py`, run:

.. code-block:: sh

   python buildscripts/resmoke.py --help

To run specific tests, simply list them:

.. code-block:: sh

   python buildscripts/resmoke.py jstests/core/find1.js jstests/core/explain*.js

You can specify as many files as you want.

We have also defined test suite configurations in the
:file:`buildscripts/resmokeconfig/suites` directory. To see which
suites are available, run:

.. code-block:: sh

    python buildscripts/resmoke.py --listSuites

To run a specific suite, use:

.. code-block:: sh

    python buildscripts/resmoke.py --suites=<SUITE>

You can also run multiple suites by specifying a comma-separated list:

.. code-block:: sh

    python buildscripts/resmoke.py --suites=<SUITE1>,<SUITE2>

To run specific tests from a suite, include the ``--executor`` option in order
to use the suite's configuration:

.. code-block:: sh

    python buildscripts/resmoke.py --executor=<SUITE> path/to/tests/*.js

To run the tests in parallel, specify the number of jobs using the ``--jobs``
option:

.. code-block:: sh

    python buildscripts/resmoke.py --suites=<SUITE> --jobs=<N>

.. note::

    Although running the tests in parallel can, in some cases,
    significantly decrease execution time, use with caution. When
    :file:`resmoke.py` needs to start a :program:`mongod` or any other
    MongoDB deployment, it will set up one per job, which can be
    resource intensive.

Running dbtests
---------------


All dbtests are in the `dbtests directory
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/master/src/mongo/dbtests>`_.
These tests are "heavy": they link against a large portion of the kernel
code. In this sense, the old-style "unit tests" are closer to
integration tests than to true unit tests. Running a dbtest requires a
great deal of setup; for example, initializing the global authorization
manager and creating at least one thread.

Compile C++ dbtests by calling from the root directory:

.. code-block:: sh

   scons dbtest

This compiles the source for all dbtests into a single executable called
``dbtest``. You can run all the dbtests in parallel by using :file:`resmoke.py`:

.. code-block:: sh

   python buildscripts/resmoke.py --suites=dbtest --jobs=<N>

To list the available dbtests, call:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./dbtest --list

To run a specific dbtest, call:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./dbtest <testname>

.. _run-unit-tests:

Running C++ Unit Tests
----------------------

New-style unit tests are in the same directory as the files they test.
The test files take their name from the files that they test but
include ``_test``; e.g. ``foo_test.cpp`` to test ``foo.cpp``.

Unlike dbtests, the new-style tests are standalone: each one is an
independent SCons target. These tests are enumerated in
``build/unittests.txt``, which is generated by SCons upon building the
unittests target.

To run all new-style C++ unit tests:

#. Build the tests:

   .. code-block:: sh

      scons unittests

#. Use :file:`resmoke.py` to run all of them. To decrease the execution
   time, specify multiple jobs:

   .. code-block:: sh

      python buildscripts/resmoke.py --suites=unittests --jobs=<N>

In some cases, you may just want to run one or two of the unit tests.
For example, the following explicitly builds and runs a single C++ unit
test ``mutable_bson_test``:

.. code-block:: sh

   scons ./build/unittests/mutable_bson_test
   ./build/unittests/mutable_bson_test
