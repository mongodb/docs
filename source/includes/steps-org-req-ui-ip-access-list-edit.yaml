  a. In :guilabel:`Organization Settings`, navigate to :guilabel:`Define IP Access List for the Atlas User Interface`.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Configure`.
     The :guilabel:`IP Access List for the Atlas UI` page opens where you
     can make changes to the IP access list for the {+atlas-ui+} for your organization.

  a. Click :guilabel:`Edit`.
     The IP list table opens that allows you to add additional IP addresses
     or CIDR block ranges.

     You can:

     - Add IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, such as ``1.1.1.2``, for IPv4, and
       ``3ffe:1900:fe21:4545:0000:0000:0000:0000``, for IPv6, or CIDR block
       ranges, such as ``2.1.1.1/16``, and their descriptions to the list.

     - Click :icon-fa5:`trash-alt` to delete an entered address or range
       and enter a new one instead.

     |service| validates IP addresses and CIDR blocks that you enter and flags
     invalid entries.

     You can't:

     - Delete all addresses or your own IP address from the list. If you
       attempt to delete these addresses, |service| prevents you from saving changes.
     - Add invalid IP addresses, such as malformed or out of range addresses
       for the entered CIDR ranges.
     - Add duplicate addresses. You can, however, add a CIDR range that contains
       a particular IP address and also enter that IP address itself.
     - Edit addresses or CIDR blocks in the table. To edit an entry,
       delete it and add a new entry.

  #. Add an optional description.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Add Entry` to add an IP address or a CIDR range, or
     click :guilabel:`Add my Current IP Address`.

  |service| disables the :guilabel:`Save` button in the upper-right corner
  if you delete your own IP address or a CIDR block with your IP address
  from the list.

  To activate the :guilabel:`Save` button, add a CIDR block with your
  current IP address (or your IP address) to the list, in addition to any
  other addresses or CIDR ranges that you or other organization owners
  have already added.

  Click :guilabel:`Save.`

  |service| shows a confirmation message that it successfully saved changes.

  API keys that inherit from this IP access list use the list for IP access
  restrictions.
