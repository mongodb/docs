ref: 4.2-downgrade-fcv-index-key
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, for ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV)
   set to ``"4.2"`` or greater, MongoDB removes the Index Key
   Limit. For fCV set to ``"4.0"``, the limit still applies.

   If you have an index with keys that exceed the :limit:`Index Key
   Limit` once fCV is set to ``"4.0"``,
   consider changing the index to a hashed index or to indexing a
   computed value. You can also **temporarily** use
   ``failIndexKeyTooLong`` set to ``false`` before resolving
   the problem. However, with ``failIndexKeyTooLong`` set to
   ``false``, queries that use these indexes can return incomplete
   results.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.2, for ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV)
   set to ``"4.2"`` or greater, MongoDB removes the :limit:`Index Name
   Length`. For fCV set to ``"4.0"``, the limit still applies.

   If you have an index with a name that exceeds the :limit:`Index Name
   Length` once fCV is set to ``"4.0"``,
   drop and recreate the index with a shorter name.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.dropIndex( <name | index specification> )

      db.collection.createIndex(
         { <index specification> },

ref: 4.2-downgrade-fcv-unique-index
content: |

   With ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV) ``"4.2"``, MongoDB uses a
   new internal format for unique indexes that is incompatible with
   MongoDB 4.0. The new internal format applies to both existing unique
   indexes as well as newly created/rebuilt unique indexes.
   
   If fCV has ever been set to ``"4.2"``, use the following script to
   drop and recreate all unique indexes.

      db.adminCommand("listDatabases").databases.forEach(function(d){

                  if (res.ok !== 1)
                     assert.commandWorked(res);

ref: 4.2-downgrade-fcv-system-unique-index
content: |

   In addition, if you have enabled :doc:`access control
   </tutorial/enable-authentication>`, you must also remove the system
   unique index ``user_1_db_1`` on the ``admin.system.users``
   collection.

   If fCV has ever been set to ``"4.2"``, use the following command to
   drop the ``user_1_db_1`` system unique index:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("admin").getCollection("system.users").dropIndex("user_1_db_1")

   The ``user_1_db_1`` index will automatically be rebuilt when starting
   the server with the 4.0 binary in the procedure below.

ref: 4.2-downgrade-fcv-unique-index-access-control-sharded-cluster
content: |

      If your sharded cluster has access control enabled, your
      downgrade user privileges must include additional privileges to
      manage indexes on the ``config`` database.

      .. code-block:: javascript
      
         db.getSiblingDB("admin").createRole({
              role: "configIndexRole",
              privileges: [
                 {
                   resource: { db: "config", collection: "" },
                   actions: [ "find", "dropIndex", "createIndex", "listIndexes" ]
                 }
              ],
              roles: [  ]
         });

      Add the newly created role to your downgrade user. For example,
      if you have a user ``myDowngradeUser`` in the ``admin`` database
      that already has the :authrole:`root` role, use
      :method:`db.grantRolesToUser()` to grant the additional role:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.getSiblingDB("admin").grantRolesToUser( "myDowngradeUser", 
            [ { role: "configIndexRole", db: "admin" } ], 
            {  w: "majority", wtimeout: 4000 }
         );

ref: 4.2-downgrade-fcv-unique-index-script-local-users

   After you have run the script on :binary:`~bin.mongos`, you need to
   check individual shards if you have created :ref:`shard local
   users<shard-local-users>`. That is, if you created maintenance users
   directly on the shards instead of through :binary:`~bin.mongos`, run
   the script on the primary member of the shard.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      // A script to rebuild unique indexes after downgrading fcv 4.2 to 4.0.
      // Run this script on shards to drop and recreate unique indexes 
      // for backwards compatibility with 4.0.
      
      let mdb = db.getSiblingDB('admin');
      
      mdb.getCollectionInfos( { type: "collection" } ).forEach(function(c){
         let currentCollection = mdb.getCollection(c.name);
   
         currentCollection.getIndexes().forEach(function(idx){
            if (idx.unique){
               print("Dropping and recreating the following index:" + tojson(idx))

               assert.commandWorked(mdb.runCommand({dropIndexes: c.name, index: idx.name}));

               let res = mdb.runCommand({ createIndexes: c.name, indexes: [idx] });
               if (res.ok !== 1)
                  assert.commandWorked(res);

ref: 4.2-downgrade-fcv-wildcard-index
content: |
   
   For ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fCV) set to ``"4.2"``, MongoDB
   supports creating :ref:`wildcard-index-core`. You must drop all
   wildcard indexes before downgrading to fCV ``"4.0"``. 

   Use the following script to drop and recreate all wildcard indexes:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      // A script to drop wildcard indexes before downgrading fcv 4.2 to 4.0.
      // Run this script to drop wildcard indexes 
      // for backwards compatibility with 4.0.
      
      db.adminCommand("listDatabases").databases.forEach(function(d){
         let mdb = db.getSiblingDB(d.name);
         mdb.getCollectionInfos({ type: "collection" }).forEach(function(c){
            let currentCollection = mdb.getCollection(c.name);
            currentCollection.getIndexes().forEach(function(idx){
               
               var key = Object.keys(idx.key);
               if (key[0].includes("$**")) {

                 print("Dropping index: " + idx.name + " from " + idx.ns);

                 let res = mdb.runCommand({dropIndexes: currentCollection, index: idx.name});
                 assert.commandWorked(res);

               }

            });
         });
      });

   .. important::

      Downgrading to fCV ``"4.0"`` during an in-progress wildcard index
      build does *not* automatically drop or kill the index build. The
      index build can complete after downgrading to fcv ``"4.0"``,
      resulting in a valid wildcard index on the collection. Starting
      the 4.0 binary against against that data directory will result in
      startup failures.

      Use :method:`db.currentOp()` to check for any in-progress wildcard
      index builds. Once any in-progress wildcard index builds complete,
      run the script to drop them *before* downgrading to 
      fCV ``"4.0"``.
