Embedded Data Versus References

Effective data models support your application's needs. One key decision
for your schema design is whether to :ref:`embed data
<data-modeling-embedding>` or :ref:`use references
<data-modeling-referencing>`.

Embedded Data Models
--------------------

You can embed related data in a single document. In the following
example, the ``contact`` and ``access`` fields are embedded documents:

.. include:: /images/data-model-denormalized.rst

Embedded data models are often **denormalized**, because
frequently-accessed data is duplicated in multiple collections.

Embedded data models let applications query related pieces of
information in the same database record. As a result, applications
require fewer queries and updates to complete common operations.

Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~

Use embedded data models in the following scenarios:

- You have "contains" relationships between entities. For example, a
  ``contacts`` document that contains an ``address``. See
  :ref:`data-modeling-example-one-to-one`.

- You have one-to-many relationships between entities. In these
  relationships, the "many" or child documents are viewed in the context
  of the "one" or parent documents. See
  :ref:`data-modeling-example-one-to-many`.

Embedding provides the following benefits:

- Better performance for read operations

- The ability to retrieve related data in a single database operation

- The ability to to update related data in a single atomic write
  operation

Query Embedded Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query data within embedded documents, use :term:`dot notation`. For
examples of querying data in arrays and embedded documents, see:

- :ref:`read-operations-arrays`

- :ref:`read-operations-embedded-documents`

.. note:: Document Size Limit

   Documents in MongoDB must be smaller than 16 mebibytes.

   For large binary data, consider :ref:`GridFS <gridfs>`.

.. _data-modeling-referencing:

References
----------

References store relationships between data by including links, called
**references**, from one document to another. In the following example,
the ``contact`` and ``access`` documents contain a reference to the
``user`` document.

.. include:: /images/data-model-normalized.rst

References result in **normalized** data models because data is divided
into multiple collections and not duplicated.

Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~

Use references to link related data in the following scenarios:

- Embedding would result in duplication of data but would not
  provide sufficient read performance advantages to outweigh the
  implications of the duplication. For example, when the embedded data
  frequently changes. 

- You need to represent complex many-to-many relationships or large
  hierarchical data sets.

- The related entity is frequently queried on its own. For example, if
  you have ``employee`` and ``department`` data, you may consider
  embedding department information in the ``employee`` documents.
  However, if you often query for a list of departments, your
  application will perform best with a separate ``department``
  collection that is linked to the ``employee`` collection with a
  reference.

Query Normalized Data Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query normalized data in multiple collections, MongoDB provides the
following aggregation stages:

- :pipeline:`$lookup`

- :pipeline:`$graphLookup`

For an example of normalized data models, see
:ref:`data-modeling-publisher-and-books`.

For examples of various tree models, see
:ref:`data-model-tree-structure`.
