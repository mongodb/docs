Self-managed X.509 certificates provide database users access to the 
{+database-deployments+} in your project. Database users are separate from |service| 
users. Database users have access to MongoDB databases, while |service| 
users have access to the |service| application itself.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to use self-managed X.509 certificates, you must have a
Public Key Infrastructure to integrate with |service-fullname|.
