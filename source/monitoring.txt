Overview
--------

Learn how to observe the behavior of your {+source-connector+} or
{+sink-connector+} through **monitoring**.
Monitoring is the process of getting information about the
activities a running program performs for use in an application
or an application performance management library.

To learn how monitoring works in the connector and how to use
it, see the :ref:`<kafka-monitoring-information>` section.

To view an example that shows how to monitor a running connector,
see the :ref:`<kafka-monitoring-example>` section. 

To view a list of all metrics produced by MongoDB source and sink
connectors, see the :ref:`<kafka-monitoring-all-attributes>` section.

Use Cases
---------

This section describes use cases for monitoring MongoDB source and sink
connectors, and how you can use the metrics your connector provides
to satisfy those use cases.

.. tip:: Computed Values

   To learn what types of metrics the connector provides and when
   to implement logic to compute a value, see
   :ref:`<kafka-monitoring-types-of-metrics>`.

Sink Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes some use cases for monitoring the MongoDB
sink connector and the metrics the sink connector provides
to satisfy those use cases:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Use Case
     - Metrics to Use

   * - You want to know if a component of your pipeline is falling behind.
     - Use the ``latest-kafka-time-difference-ms``
       metric. This metric indicates the interval of time between
       when a record arrived in a Kafka topic and when your connector
       received that record. If the value of this metric is increasing,
       it signals that there may be a problem with {+kafka+} or MongoDB. 

   * - You want to know the total number of records your connector
       wrote to MongoDB.
     - Use the ``records`` metric.

   * - You want to know the total number of write errors your connector
       encountered when attempting to write to MongoDB.
     - Use the ``batch-writes-failed`` metric.

   * - You want to know if your MongoDB performance is getting slower
       over time.
     - Use the ``in-task-put-duration-ms`` metric to initially diagnose
       a slowdown.

       Use the following metrics to further diagnose any issues:
     
       - ``batch-writes-successful-duration-over-<number>-ms``
       - ``batch-writes-failed-duration-over-<number>-ms``
       - ``processing-phase-duration-over-<number>-ms``
 
   * - You want to find the time {+kafka-connect+} and the MongoDB sink
       connector spend writing records to MongoDB.
     - Compare the values of the following metrics:
     
       - ``in-task-put-duration-ms``
       - ``in-connect-framework-duration-ms``

You can find descriptions of all MongoDB sink connector metrics in the
:ref:`<kafka-monitoring-sink-attributes>` section.

Source Connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes some use cases for monitoring the MongoDB
source connector and the metrics the source connector provides
to satisfy those use cases:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Use Case
     - Metrics to Use

   * - You want to know if a component of your pipeline is falling behind.
     - Use the ``latest-mongodb-time-difference-secs``
       metric. This metric indicates how old the most recent change
       stream event your connector processed is. If this metric is increasing,
       it signals that there may be a problem with {+kafka+} or MongoDB. 

   * - You want to know the total number of change stream events your source connector
       has processed. 
     - Use the ``records`` metric.

   * - You want to know the percentage of records your connector
       received but failed to write to {+kafka+}.
     - Perform the following calculation with the ``records``,
       ``records-filtered``, and ``records-acknowledged`` metrics:

       .. code-block:: text
      
          (records - (records-acknowledged + records-filtered)) / records

   * - You want to know the average size of the documents your connector
       has processed.
     - Perform the following calculation with the ``mongodb-bytes-read`` and
       ``records`` metrics:

       .. code-block:: text

          mongodb-bytes-read / records
      
       To learn how to calculate the average size of records over a span of
       time, see :ref:`mongodb-bytes-read <kafka-monitoring-averge-record-size-span>`.

   * - You want to find the time {+kafka-connect+} and the MongoDB
       source connector spend writing records to {+kafka+}.
     - Compare the values of the following metrics:
     
       - ``in-task-poll-duration-ms``
       - ``in-connect-framework-duration-ms``

   * - You want to know if your MongoDB performance is getting slower
       over time.
     - Use the ``in-task-poll-duration-ms`` metric to initially diagnose
       a slowdown.
     
       Use the following metrics to further diagnose any issues:
     
       - ``initial-commands-successful-duration-over-<number>-ms``
       - ``initial-commands-failed-duration-over-<number>-ms``
       - ``getmore-commands-successful-duration-over-<number>-ms``
       - ``getmore-commands-failed-duration-over-<number>-ms``

You can find descriptions of all MongoDB source connector metrics in the
:ref:`<kafka-monitoring-source-attributes>` section.

Monitor the Connector
---------------------

The {+connector+} uses **{+jmx-long+} (JMX)** to enable monitoring.
JMX is a technology included in the {+java-se+} that provides
tools to monitor applications and devices. You can view the
metrics produced by the connector with any JMX console, such
as {+jconsole+}.

The {+connector+} provides metrics for individual **tasks**.
Tasks are classes instantiated by {+kafka-connect+} that copy
data to and from datastores and {+kafka+}. The names and
responsibilities of the two types of tasks in {+kafka-connect+} are as
follows:

- A source task copies data from a data store to {+kafka+}.
- A sink task copies data from {+kafka+} to a data store.

A sink connector configures one or more sink tasks.
A source connector configures one or more source tasks.

To learn more about JMX, see the following resources from Oracle:

- `Java Management Extensions Guide <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/jmx/introduction-jmx-technology.html>`__
- `Using {+jconsole+} <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/management/using-jconsole.html>`__

To learn more about tasks and connectors in {+kafka-connect+}, see the following resources:

- `Kafka Connect Concepts from Confluent <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/concepts.html#tasks>`__
- `{+kafka-connect+} API documentation for the Task interface <{+kafka_api_docs_base+}javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/connect/connector/Task.html>`__
- `{+kafka-connect+} API documentation for the Connector abstract class <{+kafka_api_docs_base+}javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/connector/Connector.html>`__

Enable Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+connector+} uses {+kafka-connect+}'s metrics infrastructure to
serve metrics. To read the metrics produced by your connector,
enable JMX in your {+kafka-connect+} deployment.

To learn how to enable JMX for a {+kafka-connect+} instance
running on your host machine, see the
`Official Kafka Documentation <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#monitoring>`__.

To learn how to enable JMX for a containerized {+kafka-connect+}
deployment, see
`Kafka Monitoring and Metrics Using JMX with Docker <https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/docker/operations/monitoring.html>`__.

.. _kafka-monitoring-types-of-metrics:

Types of Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The connector provides metrics related to the following
types of quantities:

- The number of times an event has occurred in total for a connector task
- The value related to the most recent occurrence of an event

For some use cases, you must perform extra computations with the
metrics the connector provides. For example, you can compute the
following values from provided metrics:

- The rate of change of a metric
- The value of a metric over a span of time
- The difference between one metric and another metric    

To view some examples of computed metrics, see the
:ref:`<kafka-monitoring-use-cases>` section.

JMX Paths
~~~~~~~~~

The {+connector+} and {+kafka-connect+} both produce metrics for MongoDB connector
tasks.

Both sets of metrics provide information about how your tasks
interact with {+kafka-connect+}, but only the {+connector+}
metrics provide information about how your tasks interact with
MongoDB.

The {+connector+} produces metrics under the following JMX
paths:

- ``{+metrics-path+}.sink-task-metrics.sink-task-<monitonically increasing number>``
- ``{+metrics-path+}.source-task-metrics.source-task-<monitonically increasing number>``
- ``{+metrics-path+}.source-task-metrics.source-task-change-stream-<monitonically increasing number>``
- ``{+metrics-path+}.source-task-metrics.source-task-copy-existing-<monitonically increasing number>``

{+kafka-connect+} produces metrics under the following JMX paths:

- ``kafka.connect.sink-task-metrics.<connector-name>``
- ``kafka.connect.source-task-metrics.<connector-name>``
- ``kafka.connect.connector-task-metrics.<connector-name>``

To relate {+kafka-connect+} metrics to {+connector+} metrics, you must remember the
order in which you added your connectors to {+kafka-connect+}.

.. note:: Naming Conflicts

   If the {+connector+} ever encounters a naming conflict when it attempts
   to register an ``MBean`` on a JMX path, the {+connector+} adds a version suffix
   to the ``MBean``.

   For example, if the connector tries to register an ``MBean`` under the path 
   ``{+metrics-path+}.sink-task-metrics.sink-task-0`` and is unable to do
   so, it attempts to register the ``MBean`` under
   ``{+metrics-path+}.sink-task-metrics.sink-task-0-v1``. 


Example
```````

Assume you add a single MongoDB source connector
named ``my-source-connector`` to your deployment.

The MongoDB source connector writes metrics to the following
JMX path:  

- ``{+metrics-path+}.sink-task-metrics.sink-task-0``

{+kafka-connect+} writes metrics for this task under the following
path:

- ``kafka.connect.sink-task-metrics.my-source-connector``

.. _kafka-monitoring-example:

Example - Monitor the Quick Start
---------------------------------

The sample environment provided in the Quick Start exposes metrics
on your host machine at the URI ``localhost:{+jmx-port-mapping+}``.

To view these metrics with {+jconsole+}, perform the following actions:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Download {+jconsole+}.

      {+jconsole+} is part of the {+java-se+}. To download {+jconsole+}, download the
      `Java SE Development Kit <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/>`__
      from Oracle.

   .. step:: Start the Quick Start pipeline and add connectors.

      Follow the Quick Start until the :ref:`<kafka-quick-start-send-a-document>`
      step.

   .. step:: Start {+jconsole+}.

      Run the following command from your command line to start {+jconsole+}:

      .. code-block:: shell

         {+jconsole_command+}

   .. step:: Connect to the {+kafka-connect+} JMX server.

      a. Enter your JMX Server URI ``localhost:{+jmx-port-mapping+}``
         into the
         :guilabel:`Remote Process` text input box in the {+jconsole+}
         interface.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Connect`.

      #. In the dialog box, click :guilabel:`Insecure Connection`.

   .. step:: Explore your connectors' metrics.

      a. Navigate to the :guilabel:`MBeans` tab in {+jconsole+}.

      #. Inspect connector metrics. Notice that the 
         ``{+metrics-path+}.sink-task-metrics.sink-task-0.records``
         attribute has a value of ``0``. This
         value indicates that your sink task has not received any
         records from {+kafka+}.

      #. Continue the Quick Start until, but not through, the
         :ref:`<kafka-quickstart-remove-the-sandbox>` step.

      #. Navigate back to the :guilabel:`MBeans` tab in {+jconsole+}.
         The ``{+metrics-path+}.sink-task-metrics.sink-task-0.records``
         attribute should now have a value of ``1``.

   .. step:: Stop and remove the Quick Start environment.

      To stop and remove the Quick Start environment, follow the
      :ref:`<kafka-quickstart-remove-the-sandbox>` step of the Quick Start.
 
.. _kafka-monitoring-all-attributes:

Available Metrics
-----------------

Use the attributes in the tables in this section to monitor the behavior of your source and
sink connectors through {+jmx-long+} (JMX).

.. tip:: JMX Attributes

   {+jmx-hover+} represents an individual metric as an attribute of an ``MBean``.
   To learn more about attributes and ``MBeans``, see the
   `Standard MBeans Tutorial <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jmx/mbeans/standard.html>`__
   from Oracle.

.. note:: Poll and Put Methods

   A MongoDB source connector task has a ``poll()`` method to retrieve
   documents from MongoDB and send them to {+kafka+}. A MongoDB sink
   connector task has a ``put()`` method to retrieve documents from {+kafka+}
   and send them to MongoDB.

   To learn more about ``poll()`` and ``put()`` methods, see the following
   resources:

   - `{+kafka-connect+} API documentation for SourceTask interface <{+kafka_api_docs_base+}javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/source/SourceTask.html>`__
   - `{+kafka-connect+} API documentation for SinkTask interface <{+kafka_api_docs_base+}javadoc/org/apache/kafka/connect/sink/SinkTask.html>`__

Source Connector JMX Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Initial Commands and ``getMore`` Commands

   Some metrics for source connector tasks distinguish between
   **initial commands** and ``getMore`` commands. An initial
   command is a ``find`` or ``aggregate`` command sent to a MongoDB
   instance that retrieves the first set of documents in a client-side
   MongoDB cursor. The ``getMore`` command is the MongoDB command that fetches
   the subsequent sets of documents in a cursor.

   To learn more about ``getMore`` commands, see the
   :manual:`getMore </reference/command/getMore>` page.
