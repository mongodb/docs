You can perform a transaction to run a series of operations that do not
change any data until the entire transaction is committed. This usage
example uses the **Convenient Transaction API** to perform a transaction.

   To learn more about the performing transactions in the
   {+driver-short+}, see the :ref:`nodejs-transactions` guide.

   The {+driver-short+} also provides the Core API to perform
   transactions. To learn more about the Core API, see the
   :ref:`node-usage-core-txn` usage example.

Example
-------

Consider a situation in which a customer purchases items from your shop.
To record the purchase, your application must update
your inventory and record the order information.

The following table describes the collections that store purchase data
and how a purchase changes the data in each collection.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Collection
     - Operation
     - Description of the Change

   * - ``orders``
     - insert
     - Inserts a document that describes the order

   * - ``inventory``
     - update
     - Updates the quantities of items available after a purchase

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``inventory`` collection contains the
following documents:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/transactions/txn-convenient.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent:
   :copyable: false
   :start-after: start-inventory
   :end-before: end-inventory

You store purchase records in the ``orders`` collection of the
``testdb`` database. This collection is empty, as there have been no
purchases.

Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code example in this section demonstrates how to use the Convenient
Transaction API to perform a multi-document transaction in a session. In
this example, the transaction makes the changes needed when a
customer purchases items from your shop.

This example code performs a transaction through the following actions:

1. Calls the ``withSession()`` method on the client to implicitly create
   the session and run the callback passed to it within the session.

#. Calls the ``withTransaction()`` method on the session to create a
   transaction, run the callback passed to it, and commit the
   transaction. If the transaction fails, this method ends the
   transaction and returns an error message.

#. Performs the following operations within the transaction:

   * Updates the ``inventory`` and ``orders`` collections if there is
     sufficient inventory to fulfill the purchase
   * Ends the transaction and throws an exception if there isn't
     sufficient inventory for any item in the order
   * Returns a message acknowledging that the transaction
     committed successfully with a copy of the purchase record

#. Prints the return type of ``withSession()``, which is either the
   error message or the acknowledgment that the transaction completed.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/transactions/txn-convenient.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-transaction
   :end-before: end-transaction

Sample Orders and Transaction Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the results of the transactions performed for two
sample orders.

Sufficient inventory exists for the following order, so the transaction
successfully completes:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/transactions/txn-convenient.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent:
   :copyable: false
   :start-after: start-order-successful
   :end-before: end-order-successful

After passing this order to the example transaction code, the code
outputs the following result:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false
   
   Order successfully completed and recorded!
   Receipt:
   {
     "date": "2023-08-25T20:06:52.564Z",
     "items": [
       { "item": "sunblock", "qty": 3 },
       { "item": "beach chair", "qty": 1 }
     ],
     "total": 43,
     "_id": "..."
   }

In the ``inventory`` collection, the quantity of
``"sunblock"`` is now ``82`` and the quantity of ``"beach chair"``
is ``29``. The ``orders`` collection contains the record of the
purchase.

There is not sufficient inventory for the following order, so the
driver ends the transaction:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/transactions/txn-convenient.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent:
   :copyable: false
   :start-after: start-order-fail
   :end-before: end-order-fail

After passing this order to the example transaction code, the code
outputs the following result:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false
   
   Item not found or insufficient quantity.

Since the driver ends the transaction, there are no changes to
the ``inventory`` and ``orders`` collections.
