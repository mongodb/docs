Enforce Data Consistency with Transactions

You can use :ref:`transactions <transactions>` to enforce consistency
between collections that contain duplicated data. Transactions update
multiple collections in a single atomic operation.

Use transactions to enforce consistency if your application must always
return up-to-date data and can tolerate potential negative performance
impact during periods of heavy reads.

Transactions might not be as performant as other methods of enforcing
data consistency. Read performance might be negatively impacted while a
transaction is open. However, transactions ensure that the data read by
the client is always current.

About this Task
---------------

To use transactions, you must connect to a replica set or sharded
cluster. You cannot use transactions on standalone deployments.

Steps
-----

The following example enforces data consistency in an e-commerce
application. The example schema duplicates product information in the
``products`` and ``sellers`` collections. This schema design optimizes
queries for both products and sellers.

When a product is updated, such as when its price changes, it is
critical that the price is consistent in the ``products`` and
``sellers`` collections. Therefore, transactions are a reasonable method
to enforce data consistency in this application.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create the products collection

      .. code-block:: javascript

         use test
         
         db.products.insertMany(
            [
               {
                  sellerId: 456,
                  name: "sweater",
                  price: 30,         
                  rating: 4.9
               },
               {
                  sellerId: 456,
                  name: "t-shirt",
                  price: 10,         
                  rating: 4.2
               },
               {
                  sellerId: 456,
                  name: "vest",
                  price: 20,         
                  rating: 4.7
               }
            ]
         )

   .. step:: Create the sellers collection

      .. code-block:: javascript

          use test
          
          db.sellers.insertOne(
             {
                id: 456,
                name: "Cool Clothes Co",
                location: {
                   address: "21643 Andreane Shores",
                   state: "Ohio",
                   country: "United States"
                },
                phone: "567-555-0105",
                products: [
                   {
                      name: "sweater",
                      price: 30
                   },
                   {
                      name: "t-shirt",
                      price: 10
                   },
                   {
                      name: "vest",
                      price: 20
                   }
                ]
             }
          )

   .. step:: Configure a transaction to handle updates

      .. note::

         The following example uses a transaction in :binary:`mongosh`. To see
         transaction examples for MongoDB drivers, see :ref:`transactions`.

      The following example uses a transaction to update the price of
      the ``vest`` in both the ``products`` and ``sellers`` collections:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         // Start a session
         session = db.getMongo().startSession( { readPreference: { mode: "primary" } } );
         productsCollection = session.getDatabase("test").products;
         sellersCollection = session.getDatabase("test").sellers;

         // Start a transaction
         session.startTransaction( { readConcern: { level: "local" }, writeConcern: { w: "majority" } } );
         
         // Operations inside the transaction
         try {
            productsCollection.updateOne(
               { sellerId: 456, name: "vest" },
               { $set: { price: 25 } }
            );
            sellersCollection.updateOne(
               { },
               { $set: { "products.$[element].price": 25 } },
               { arrayFilters: [ { "element.name": "vest" } ] }
            );
         } catch (error) {
            // Cancel transaction on error
            session.abortTransaction();
            throw error;
         }
         // Commit the transaction using write concern set at transaction start
         session.commitTransaction();
         session.endSession();

Results
-------

To confirm that the price was updated and that the data is consistent,
query the ``products`` and ``sellers`` collections.

Query the Products Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript
   
   db.products.find( { sellerId: 456, name: "vest" } )

Output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   [
      {
        _id: ObjectId("64d506c3ddebf45734d06c58"),
        sellerId: 456,
        name: 'vest',
        price: 25,
        rating: 4.7
      } 
   ]

Query the Sellers Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.sellers.find( { id: 456, "products.name": "vest" } )

Output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 15

   [
      {
        _id: ObjectId("64d516d9ddebf45734d06c5a"),
        id: 456,
        name: 'Cool Clothes Co',
        location: {
          address: '21643 Andreane Shores',
          state: 'Ohio',
          country: 'United States'
        },
        phone: '567-555-0105',
        products: [
          { name: 'sweater', price: 30 },
          { name: 't-shirt', price: 10 },
          { name: 'vest', price: 25 }
        ]
      }
   ]
