     questions, discussions, or general technical support

Connection Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following error message indicates that the driver cannot connect to a server
on the specified hostname or port. Multiple situations can generate this error
message. In this sample error message, the hostname is ``127.0.0.1`` and the
port is ``27017``:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017

The following sections describe actions you can take to potentially resolve the
issue.

.. _node-troubleshooting-connection-string-port:

Check Your Connection String
----------------------------

Verify that the hostname and port number in the connection string are both
accurate. The default port value for a MongoDB instance is
``27017``, but you can configure MongoDB to communicate on another port.

.. _node-troubleshooting-connection-firewall:

Configure Your Firewall
-----------------------

Verify that the ports your MongoDB deployment listens on are not blocked by a
firewall on the same network. MongoDB uses port ``27017`` by default. To learn
more about the default ports MongoDB uses and how to change them, see
:manual:`Default MongoDB Port </reference/default-mongodb-port/>`.

.. warning::

   Do not open a port in your firewall unless you are sure it's the port
   used by your MongoDB deployment.

ECONNREFUSED Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the connection is refused when the driver attempts to connect to the MongoDB
instance, it generates this error message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   MongoServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED <IPv6 address>:<port>

The following sections describe actions you can take to potentially resolve the
issue.

Ensure MongoDB and Your Client Use the Same Protocol
----------------------------------------------------

In Node.js v17 and later, the DNS resolver uses ``IPv6`` by default when both
the client and host support both. For example, if MongoDB uses IPv4 and your
client uses IPv6, the driver returns the previous error message.

You can configure your MongoDB deployment to use ``IPv6`` mode when starting
with ``mongod`` or ``mongos``. For more information about how to specify
``IPv6`` mode, see
:manual:`IP Binding </core/security-mongodb-configuration/>` in the server
manual.

As an alternative, you can explicitly use ``IPv4`` with your client by
specifying ``family: 4`` as an
`option to your MongoClient <{+api+}/interfaces/MongoClientOptions.html#family>`__.

.. code-block:: js

   const client = new MongoClient(uri, {
     family: 4,
   });

ECONNRESET Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the connection is reset when the driver calls ``client.connect()``, it
generates this error message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   MongoServerSelectionError: connect ECONNRESET ::<IP address>:<port>

The following section describes a method that may help resolve the issue.

Control the Number of File Descriptors
--------------------------------------

A file descriptor is a unique identifier associated with an open process. In most
operating systems, each open connection from the driver is associated with a
file descriptor. Operating systems typically have a limit on the number of file
descriptors used by a single process. An ``ECONNRESET`` error can occur
if the number of connections exceeds this limit.

You can set the maximum number of connections by setting ``maxPoolSize``. To
resolve this error, you can decrease the number of maximum allowed connections
by setting the value of ``maxPoolSize``. Alternatively, you could increase the
file descriptor limit in your operating system.

.. warning::

   Always be cautious when changing the configuration of your operating system.

Authentication Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+driver-short+} can fail to connect to a MongoDB instance if
the authorization is not configured correctly. If you are using ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
for authentication and the driver fails to connect, the driver might raise an
error message similar to one of the following messages:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Command failed with error 18 (AuthenticationFailed): 'Authentication
   failed.' on server <hostname>:<port>.

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   connection() error occurred during connection handshake: auth error:
   sasl conversation error: unable to authenticate using mechanism
   "SCRAM-SHA-256": (AuthenticationFailed) Authentication failed.

The following sections describe actions you can take to potentially resolve the
issue.

.. _node-troubleshooting-connection-string-auth:

Check Your Connection String
----------------------------

An invalid connection string is the most common cause of authentication
issues when attempting to connect to MongoDB using ``SCRAM-SHA-256``.

.. tip::

   For more information about connection strings,
   see :ref:`Connection URI <node-connection-uri>` in the Connection Guide.

If your connection string contains a username and password, ensure that they
are in the correct format. If the username or password includes any of the
following characters, they must be
`percent encoded <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1>`__:

.. code-block:: none

    : / ? # [ ] @

The following example shows how to percent encode "#MyP@assword?":

.. code-block:: javascript

   console.log(encodeURIComponent('#MyP@assword?'));

This results in the following output:

.. code-block:: none

   "%23MyP%40assword%3F"

.. _node-troubleshooting-connection-admin:

Verify the User Is in the Authentication Database
-------------------------------------------------

To successfully authenticate a connection by using a username and password with
``SCRAM-SHA-256``, the username must be defined in the authentication database.
The default authentication database is the ``admin`` database. To use a different
database for authentication, specify the ``authSource`` in the connection string.
The following example instructs the driver to use ``users`` as the authentication
database:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");
   const uri = "mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>/?authSource=users";
   const client = new MongoClient(uri);

You can check if this is the issue by attempting to connect to a MongoDB
instance hosted on the local machine with the same code. A deployment on
the same machine doesn't require any authorization to connect.

Error Sending Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the driver fails to send a command after you make a request,
it may display the following error message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   com.mongodb.MongoSocketWriteException: Exception sending message

The following sections describe actions you can take to potentially resolve the
issue.

Check the User Permissions
--------------------------

Verify that you've accessed the MongoDB deployment with the correct user. The
term "message" in the error can be a command sent by the driver.
If you are using a user that doesn't have permissions to send the command, the
driver could generate this error.

Also ensure that the user has the appropriate permissions for the message you
are sending. MongoDB uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to control access
to a MongoDB deployment. For more information about how to configure RBAC in MongoDB,
see :manual:`Default MongoDB Port </core/authorization/>`.

Configure Your Firewall
-----------------------

The firewall needs to have an open port for communicating with the MongoDB
instance. For more information about configuring the firewall, see
:ref:`Configure Your Firewall <node-troubleshooting-connection-firewall>` in
the Connection Error section.

.. _node-troubleshooting-connection-number-connections:

Check the Number of Connections
-------------------------------

Each ``MongoClient`` instance supports a maximum number of concurrent open
connections in its connection pool. You can configure the parameter ``maxPoolSize``
which defines this limit. The default value is ``100``. If there are already a
number of open connections equal to ``maxPoolSize``, the server waits until
a connection becomes available. If this wait time exceeds the ``maxIdleTimeMS``
value, the driver responds with an error.

For more information about how connection pooling works, see
:ref:`How Does Connection Pooling Work in the Node Driver? <node-faq-connection-pool>`
in the FAQ.

Too Many Open Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver creates the following error message when it attempts to open a
connection, but it's reached the maximum number of connections:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   connection refused because too many open connections

The following section describes a method that may help resolve the issue.

Check the Number of Connections
-------------------------------

To create more open connections, increase the value of ``maxPoolSize``. For more
information about checking the number of connections, see
:ref:`Check the Number of Connections <node-troubleshooting-connection-number-connections>`
in the Error Sending Message section.

Timeout Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the network is not able to deliver a request from the driver to the server
quickly enough, it can time out. When this happens, you might receive an error message
similar to the following message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   timed out while checking out a connection from connection pool: context canceled

If you receive this error, try the following action to resolve the
issue.

Set connectTimeoutMS
--------------------

The driver may hang when it's unable to establish a connection because it
takes too long attempting to reach unreachable replica set nodes. You can limit the
time the driver spends attempting to establish the connection by using the
``connectTimeMS`` setting. To learn more about this setting, see the
:manual:`Timeout Options </reference/connection-string/#timeout-options>` in
the Server manual.

Ensure the ``connectTimeoutMS`` setting is not lower than
the highest network latency you have for a member of the set. If one of the
secondary members has a latency of 10000 milliseconds, setting the
``connectTimeoutMS`` to 9000 prevents the driver from ever connecting to that
member.

The following example sets ``connectTimeoutMS`` to 10000 milliseconds.

.. code-block:: javascript

   const client = new MongoClient(uri, {
     connectTimeoutMS: 10000,
   });

Check the Number of Connections
-------------------------------

The number of connections to the server may exceed ``maxPoolSize``. For more
information about checking the number of connections, see
:ref:`Check the Number of Connections <node-troubleshooting-connection-number-connections>`
in the Error Sending Message section.
