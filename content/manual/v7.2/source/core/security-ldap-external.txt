`MongoDB Enterprise
<http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server>`_ supports
querying an LDAP server for the LDAP groups to which the authenticated user
belongs. MongoDB maps the distinguished names (DN) of each returned group
to :ref:`roles <roles>` on the ``admin`` database. MongoDB authorizes the
user based on the mapped roles and their associated privileges. See
:ref:`LDAP Authorization <security-ldap-external>` for more information.

The LDAP Authorization process is summarized below:

#. A client connects to MongoDB and performs authentication with any
   :ref:`authentication <authentication>` mechanism that
   :ref:`supports external authentication
   <security-ldap-external-compatibility>`.
   
   .. include:: /includes/extracts/sessions-external-username-limit.rst

#. MongoDB binds to the LDAP server specified with :setting:`security.ldap.servers`
   using the credentials specified with :setting:`security.ldap.bind.queryUser` and
   :setting:`security.ldap.bind.queryPassword`.

   MongoDB uses simple binding by default, but can use ``sasl`` binding
   instead if configured in :setting:`security.ldap.bind.method` and
   :setting:`security.ldap.bind.saslMechanisms`.

#. MongoDB constructs an LDAP query using the
   :setting:`security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate` and queries the LDAP server for
   the authenticated user's group membership.

   MongoDB can use the :setting:`security.ldap.userToDNMapping` option to
   transform the username for supporting the query template.

#. The LDAP server evaluates the query and returns the list of
   groups to which the authenticated user belongs.

#. MongoDB authorizes the user to perform actions on the server by mapping
   each returned group's Distinguished Name (DN) into a :ref:`role
   <authorization>` on the ``admin`` database. If a returned group DN exactly
   matches the name of an existing role on the ``admin`` database, MongoDB
   grants the user the roles and privileges assigned to that role. See
   :ref:`security-ldap-external-roles` for more information.

#. The client can perform actions on the MongoDB server which require the roles
   or privileges granted to the authenticated user.

#. At an interval defined by :parameter:`ldapUserCacheInvalidationInterval`,
   MongoDB flushes the ``$external`` cache. Prior to executing
   subsequent operations performed by externally authorized users, MongoDB
   re-acquires their group membership from the LDAP server.

Considerations
--------------

A full description of LDAP is beyond the scope of this documentation. This
page assumes prior knowledge of LDAP.

This documentation only describes MongoDB LDAP authorization, and does not
replace other resources on LDAP. We encourage you to thoroughly familiarize
yourself with LDAP and its related subject matter before configuring LDAP
authentication.

MongoDB can provide `professional services
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/consulting?tck=docs_server>`_ for optimal
configuration of LDAP authorization for your MongoDB deployment.

.. _security-ldap-external-compatibility:

Compatible Authentication Mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports LDAP authorization with the following authentication methods:

- :ref:`security-ldap`
- :ref:`security-kerberos`
- :ref:`security-auth-x509`

With this configuration, MongoDB uses LDAP, X.509, or Kerberos 
authorization to authenticate client connections.

.. _ldap-connection-pool-behavior:

Connection Pool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.2.0, when connecting to the LDAP server for
authentication/authorization, MongoDB, by default:

- Uses connection pooling if run:

  - on Windows or

  - on Linux where MongoDB Enterprise binaries are linked against
    :ref:`libldap_r <libldap-vs-libldap_r>`.

- Does not use connection pooling if run:

  - on Linux where MongoDB Enterprise binaries are linked against
    :ref:`libldap <libldap-vs-libldap_r>`.

To change the connection pooling behavior, update the
:parameter:`ldapUseConnectionPool` parameter.

``libldap`` and ``libldap_r``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-libldap.rst

User Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With LDAP authorization, user creation and management occurs on the LDAP
server. MongoDB requires creation of :ref:`roles <roles>` on the ``admin``
database, with the name of each role exactly matching a LDAP group
Distinguished Name (DN). This is in contrast to MongoDB managed authorization,
which requires creating users on the ``$external`` database.

To manage roles on the MongoDB server, authenticate as a user whose group
membership corresponds to a ``admin`` database role with role administration
privileges, such as those provided by :authrole:`userAdmin`. Create or update
roles corresponding to LDAP group DNs such that users with membership in that
group receive the appropriate roles and privileges.

For example, an LDAP group for database administrators might have a role with
administrative roles and privileges. An LDAP group for marketing or analytics
users may have a role with only have read privileges on certain databases.

.. important::

   When configuring a role for a corresponding LDAP Group, remember that *all*
   users with membership in that group can receive the configured roles and
   privileges. Consider applying the principle of least privilege when
   configuring MongoDB roles, LDAP groups, or group membership.

If no role with role administration privileges exists *AND* no
non-``$external`` user with these privileges exists, you effectively cannot
perform user management, as no new or existing roles can be altered to reflect
additions or changes to groups or group membership on the LDAP server.

To remedy a scenario where you cannot manage roles on the MongoDB server,
perform the following procedure:

#. Restart the MongoDB server without authentication and LDAP authorization

#. Create a role on the ``admin`` database whose name corresponds to the
   appropriate LDAP group Distinguished Name. When choosing a group DN,
   consider which group is most appropriate for database administration.

#. Restart the MongoDB server with authentication and LDAP authorization

#. Authenticate as a user with membership in the group corresponding to the
   created administrative role.

Existing Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A MongoDB server using LDAP for authorization makes any existing users on the
``$external`` database inaccessible. If there are existing users in
``$external`` database, you must meet the following requirements for each user
on the ``$external`` database to ensure continued access:

- User has a corresponding user object on the LDAP server

- User object has membership in the appropriate LDAP groups

- MongoDB has roles on the ``admin`` database named for the user's LDAP
  groups, such that the granted roles and privileges are identical to those
  granted to the non-``$external`` user.

If you want to continue allowing access by users *not* on the
``$external`` database, ensure the
:parameter:`authenticationMechanisms` parameter includes
``SCRAM-SHA-1`` and/or ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` as appropriate. Alternatively,
apply the requirements listed above for transitioning those users to
LDAP authorization.

Replica Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For :term:`replica sets <replica set>`, configure LDAP authorization on the
:term:`secondary` and :term:`arbiter` members first before configuring the
:term:`primary`. This also applies to :ref:`shard replica sets
<shards-concepts>`, or :ref:`config server replica sets <csrs>`.
Configure one replica set member at a time to maintain a majority of members
for write availability.

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`, you must configure LDAP
authorization on the :term:`config servers <config server>` for cluster-level
users. You can optionally configure LDAP authorization on each
:term:`shard` for shard-local users.

Configuration
-------------

You must configure the following settings to use LDAP Authorization:

To use LDAP for authorization via operating system libraries, specify the
following settings as a part of your :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`
configuration file:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 60 10

   * - Option
     - Description
     - Required

   * - :setting:`security.ldap.servers`
     - Quote-enclosed comma-separated list of LDAP servers in ``host[:port]``
       format.

       You can prefix LDAP servers with ``srv:`` and ``srv_raw:``.

       .. |ldap-binary| replace:: :binary:`mongod`

       .. include:: /includes/ldap-srv-details.rst

     - **YES**

   * - :setting:`security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate`

     - An `RFC4515 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4515>`_ and `RFC4516
       <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4516>`_ LDAP formatted query URL
       template executed by MongoDB to obtain the LDAP groups to
       which the user belongs to. The query is relative to the host or hosts
       specified in :setting:`~security.ldap.servers`.

       You can use the following tokens in the template:

       - ``{USER}`` 
             Substitutes the authenticated username, or the
             :setting:`transformed <security.ldap.userToDNMapping>`
             username, into the LDAP query.

       - ``{PROVIDED_USER}``
             Substitutes the supplied username, i.e. before either
             authentication or LDAP transformation, into the LDAP query.
             (*Available starting in version 4.2*)
          
       Only :binary:`~bin.mongod` supports this parameter. :binary:`~bin.mongos`
       defers to this setting as configured on its :term:`config servers
       <config server>`

     - **YES**

   * - :setting:`security.ldap.bind.queryUser`

     - The identity the MongoDB server binds as when connecting to and
       executing operations and queries on an LDAP server.

       Use with :setting:`~security.ldap.bind.queryPassword`.

       The user specified must have the appropriate privileges to support the
       LDAP queries generated from the configured
       :setting:`~security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate`.

     - **YES**

   * - :setting:`security.ldap.bind.queryPassword`

     - The password used to bind to an LDAP server when using
       :setting:`~security.ldap.bind.queryUser`.

     - **YES**

   * - :setting:`security.ldap.bind.method`

     - Used to specify the method the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`
       uses to authenticate, or bind, to the LDAP server. Specify ``sasl`` to
       use one of the SASL protocols defined in
       :setting:`security.ldap.bind.saslMechanisms`.

       Defaults to ``simple``.

     - **NO**, unless using ``sasl`` for binding to the LDAP server.

   * - :setting:`security.ldap.bind.saslMechanisms`

     - Used to specify the SASL mechanisms :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
       :binary:`~bin.mongos` can use when authenticating or binding to the LDAP
       server. MongoDB and the LDAP server must agree on at least one SASL
       mechanism.

       Defaults to ``DIGEST-MD5``.

     - **NO**, unless setting :setting:`~security.ldap.bind.method` to
       ``sasl``, and you need different or additional SASL mechanisms.

   * - :setting:`security.ldap.bind.useOSDefaults`

     - Windows MongoDB deployments can use the operating system credentials in
       place of :setting:`~security.ldap.bind.queryUser` and
       :setting:`~security.ldap.bind.queryPassword` for authenticating or binding
       as when connecting to the LDAP server.

     - **NO**, unless replacing :setting:`~security.ldap.bind.queryUser` and
       :setting:`~security.ldap.bind.queryPassword`.

   * - :setting:`security.ldap.userToDNMapping`

     - Depending on your :setting:`~security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate`,
       the authenticated client username may require transformation to
       support the LDAP query URL.
       :setting:`~security.ldap.userToDNMapping` allows MongoDB to
       transform incoming usernames.

     - **NO**, unless client usernames require transformation into LDAP DNs.

When you have configured LDAP authorization, restart :program:`mongod` or 
:program:`mongos`. The server now uses LDAP authorization with 
X.509, Kerberos, or LDAP to authenticate client connections.

LDAP Query Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB uses the :setting:`security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate` to create an
`RFC4516 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4516>`_ formatted LDAP query URL. In
the template, you can use either:

- ``{USER}`` placeholder to substitute the authenticated username into
  the LDAP query URL. If MongoDB transformed the username using
  :setting:`~security.ldap.userToDNMapping`, MongoDB replaces the
  ``{USER}`` token with the transformed username when constructing the
  LDAP query URL.

- ``{PROVIDED_USER}`` placeholder to substitute the supplied username,
  i.e. before either authentication or LDAP transformation, into the
  LDAP query.

Design the query template to retrieve the user's groups. 

.. example::

   The following query template returns any groups listed in the
   LDAP user object's ``memberOf`` attribute. This query assumes the ``memberOf``
   attribute exists - your specific LDAP deployment may use a different attribute
   or methodology for tracking group membership. This query also assumes
   the user authenticates using their full LDAP DN as their username.

   .. code-block:: bash

      "{USER}?memberOf?base"

The LDAP query URL must conform to the format defined in `RFC4516
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4516>`_:

.. code-block:: text

   [ dn  [ ? [attributes] [ ? [scope] [ ? [filter] [ ? [Extensions] ] ] ] ] ]

Consider the definition of each component, as quoted from RFC4516:

.. blockquote::

   The ``dn`` is an LDAP Distinguished Name using the string format described
   in `RFC4514 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4514>`_. It identifies the base
   object of the LDAP search or the target of a non-search operation.

   The ``attributes`` construct is used to indicate which attributes should be
   returned from the entry or entries.

   The ``scope`` construct is used to specify the scope of the search to perform
   in the given LDAP server. The allowable scopes are "base" for a base object
   search, "one" for a one-level search, or "sub" for a subtree search.

   The ``filter`` is used to specify the search filter to apply to entries
   within the specified scope during the search. It has the format specified
   in [RFC4515].

   The ``extensions`` construct provides the LDAP URL with an extensibility
   mechanism, allowing the capabilities of the URL to be extended in the
   future.

If the query includes an ``attribute``, MongoDB assumes the query retrieves a
the DNs which this entity is member of.

If the query does not include an attribute, MongoDB assumes the query
retrieves all entities for which the user is member of.

MongoDB currently ignores any extensions specified in the LDAP query.

.. important::

   A full description of RFC4516 or LDAP query URL construction is out of
   scope for this documentation.

Tutorials
---------

The following tutorials contain procedures for connecting to an LDAP server
via the Operating System LDAP libraries:

- :doc:`/tutorial/authenticate-nativeldap-activedirectory`
- :doc:`/tutorial/kerberos-auth-activedirectory-authz`

Connecting to a MongoDB server using LDAP Authorization
-------------------------------------------------------

When using LDAP for authorization, users connecting via
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` must:

- set :option:`--authenticationDatabase <mongosh --authenticationDatabase>` to ``$external``.

- set :option:`--authenticationMechanism <mongosh --authenticationMechanism>` to the appropriate authentication
  mechanism.

  If using :ref:`LDAP authentication <security-ldap>`, set this to ``PLAIN``.

  If using :ref:`Kerberos authentication <security-kerberos>`, set this to
  ``GSSAPI``.

  If using :ref:`x.509 <security-auth-x509>`, set this to ``MONGODB-X.509``.

- set :option:`--username <mongosh --username>` to a username that respects the
  :setting:`security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate`, or any configured
  :setting:`security.ldap.userToDNMapping` template.

- set :option:`--password <mongosh --password>` to the appropriate password.

Include the :option:`--host <mongosh --host>` and :option:`--port <mongosh --port>` of the MongoDB server,
along with any other options relevant to your deployment.

For example, the following operation authenticates to a MongoDB server running
with LDAP authentication and authorization:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongosh --username alice@dba.example.com --password  --authenticationDatabase '$external' --authenticationMechanism "PLAIN"  --host "mongodb.example.com" --port 27017

If you do not specify the password to the :option:`--password <mongosh
--password>` command-line option, :binary:`~bin.mongosh`
prompts for the password.

.. important::

   The ``$external`` argument must be placed in single quotes, not
   double quotes, to prevent the shell from interpreting ``$external``
   as a variable.

.. _security-ldap-external-roles:

MongoDB Roles for LDAP Authorization
------------------------------------

MongoDB maps each returned group distinguished name (DN) returned by
the LDAP :setting:`query <security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate>` to a
:ref:`role <authorization>` on the ``admin`` database.

If MongoDB acquires a group whose DN **exactly** matches the name of an
existing role, MongoDB grants the authenticated user roles and
:ref:`privileges <privileges>` associated with that role. If MongoDB
cannot map any of the returned groups to a role, MongoDB grants no
privileges to the user.

.. note::

   :ref:`LDAP <security-ldap>` and :ref:`kerberos <security-kerberos>`
   authentication normally require creating users in the ``$external``
   database. If you also use LDAP for authorization, you do *not* need to
   create users in the ``$external`` database. You only need to create the
   appropriate roles in the ``admin`` database. Users still authenticate
   against the ``$external`` database.

.. important::

   If you are using LDAP for authorization and your LDAP group DNs
   contain `RFC4514 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4514>`_ escaped
   sequences, the roles you create in the ``admin`` database must also
   be escaped following RFC4514.

.. example::

   A database has the following roles configured on the ``admin`` database:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
          role: "CN=dba,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com",
          privileges: [],
          roles: [ "dbAdminAnyDatabase", "clusterAdmin" ]
      }
      {
         role: "CN=analytics,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com"
         privileges: [],
         roles: [
               { role : "read", db : "web_statistics" },
               { role : "read", db : "user_statistics" }
             ]
      }

   After authenticating a user ``alice@dba.example.com`` against the
   ``$external`` database, the MongoDB server performs a query derived from
   the configured :setting:`query template
   <security.ldap.authz.queryTemplate>` to retrieve the groups which include
   the authenticated user as a member. In this example, the MongoDB server
   retrieves the following group DNs for the user:

   .. code-block:: text

      dn:CN=dba,CN=Users,dc=example,dc=com
      dn:CN=admin,CN=Users,dc=example,dc=com

   MongoDB maps these group DNs to roles on the ``admin`` database. The first
   group DN matches the first role, and MongoDB grants the authenticated user
   its roles and privileges. The second group DN does not match to any role on
   the server, so MongoDB grants no additional permissions.

   A new user ``bob@analytics.example.com`` authenticates against the
   ``$external`` database. The MongoDB server repeats the query process, using
   the provided username in the query template. In this example, the MongoDB
   server retrieves the following group DNs for the user:

   .. code-block:: text

      dn:cn=analytics,CN=Users,dc=example,dc=com

   MongoDB maps these group DNs to roles on the ``admin`` database and grants
   the authenticated user the roles and privileges of the second role.

   A new user ``workstation@guest.example.com`` authenticates against the
   ``$external`` database. The MongoDB server repeats the query process, using
   the provided username in the query template. In this example, the MongoDB
   server retrieves the following group DNs for the user:

   .. code-block:: text

      dn:cn=guest,CN=Users,dc=example,dc=com

   MongoDB maps the group to a role on the ``admin`` database and, because no
   matching roles exist, grants the user no additional permissions.
