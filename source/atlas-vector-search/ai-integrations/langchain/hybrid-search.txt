You can integrate {+avs+} with LangChain
to perform :ref:`hybrid search <as_hybrid-search>`. 
In this tutorial, you complete the following steps:

#. Set up the environment.
#. Use |service| as a vector store.
#. Create an {+avs+} and |fts| index on your data.
#. Run hybrid search queries.
#. Pass the query results into your |rag| pipeline.

   Work with a runnable version of this tutorial as a :github:`Python notebook <mongodb/docs-notebooks/blob/main/ai-integrations/langchain-hybrid-search.ipynb?tck=docs>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial, you must have the following:

.. include:: /includes/avs-python-openai-prerequisites.rst

Set Up the Environment
----------------------

.. include:: /includes/set-up-python-notebook-environment.rst

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/set-up-environment-hybrid-search.rst

Use |service| as a Vector Store
-------------------------------

You must use |service| as a vector store for your data. 
You can instantiate a vector store by using an 
existing collection in |service|.

.. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/create-vector-store-hybrid-search.rst

.. tip::

   `MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch API Reference <https://langchain-mongodb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/langchain_mongodb/vectorstores/langchain_mongodb.vectorstores.MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch.html>`__

Create the Indexes
------------------

.. note:: 

   To create {+avs+} or |fts| indexes, you must have :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` 
   or higher access to the |service| project.

To enable hybrid search queries on your vector store,
create an {+avs+} and |fts| index on the collection.
You can create the indexes by using either the 
LangChain helper methods or the 
:driver:`PyMongo Driver </pymongo/>` method:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: LangChain
      :tabid: langchain

      .. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/create-indexes-hybrid-search-langchain.rst

   .. tab:: PyMongo
      :tabid: pymongo
            
      .. include:: /includes/ai-integrations/langchain/create-indexes-hybrid-search-pymongo.rst
         
.. include:: /includes/fact-indexes-build-initial-sync.rst

Run a Hybrid Search Query
--------------------------

Once |service| builds your indexes, you can run hybrid search queries on your data. 
The following code uses the ``MongoDBAtlasHybridSearchRetriever`` `retriever 
<https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#retrievers>`__ to perform a hybrid search 
for the string ``time travel``. It also 
specifies the following parameters:

- ``vectorstore``: The name of the vector store instance.
- ``search_index_name``: The name of the Atlas Search index.
- ``top_k``: The number of documents to return.
- ``fulltext_penalty``: The penalty for full-text search. 

  The lower the penalty, the higher the full-text search score.
- ``vector_penalty``: The penalty for vector search. 
  
  The lower the penalty, the higher the vector search score.

The retriever returns a list of documents sorted by the sum of the 
full-text search score and the vector search score. The final output
of the code example includes the title, plot, and the 
different scores for each document.

To learn more about hybrid search query results,

Pass Results to a RAG Pipeline
------------------------------

You can pass your hybrid search results
into your |rag| pipeline to generate responses 
on the retrieved documents. The sample code 
does the following: 

- Defines a LangChain `prompt template 
  <https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#prompt-templates>`__
  to instruct the |llm| to use 
  the retrieved documents as context for your query.
  LangChain passes these documents to the ``{context}`` input
  variable and your query to the ``{query}`` variable.

- Constructs a `chain 
  <https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language-lcel>`__
  that specifies the following:

  - The hybrid search retriever you defined to 
    retrieve relevant documents.
    
  - The prompt template that you defined.

  - An |llm| from OpenAI to generate a 
    context-aware response. By default, this is the 
    ``gpt-3.5-turbo`` model.

- Prompts the chain with a sample query and returns the response.
  The generated response might vary.

      2. "The Time Traveler's Wife" (2009) - A romantic drama about a man with the ability to time travel involuntarily and the impact it has on his relationship with his wife.
      3. "Thrill Seekers" (1999) - A movie about two reporters trying to prevent disasters by tracking down a time traveler witnessing major catastrophes.
      4. "About Time" (2013) - A film about a man who discovers he can travel through time and uses this ability to improve his life and relationships.
      5. "My iz budushchego" (2008) - A Russian movie where four treasure seekers from the 21st century are transported back to a WWII battle, exploring themes of action, drama, fantasy, and romance.

      These movies offer a variety of perspectives on time travel and its impact on individuals and society.
