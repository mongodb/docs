   :description: Configure connection string schemes and hostnames to connect to MongoDB deployments using the General connection tab in Compass.

The :guilabel:`General` connection tab allows you to select a 
:guilabel:`Connection String Scheme` and configure the hostname or hosts 
used to connect to your MongoDB deployment. 

.. note::

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`New Connection` modal.

      .. include:: /includes/open-new-connection.rst

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Advanced Connection Options`.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`General` tab.

      a) Select a connection string scheme.

         You can select one of the following options:

         .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1
            :class: border-table

            * - Connection String Scheme
              - Definition

            * - mongodb
              - :manual:`Standard Connection String Format </reference/connection-string/>`. 
                The standard format of the MongoDB connection URI is used to 
                connect to a MongoDB deployment by specifying its hosts
                directly.
                
                Use this option to connect to standalone, replica set,
                or a sharded cluster

                If you use the standard connection string format to
                connect to an `Atlas
                <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__ deployment,
                you must turn on TLS/SSL in the
                :guilabel:`TLS/SSL` tab of the :guilabel:`New
                Connection` modal. 

            * - mongodb+srv 
              - :manual:`DNS Seed List Connection Format 
                </reference/connection-string/#dns-seed-list-connection-format>`. 
                The ``+srv`` indicates to |compass| that the hostname that follows 
                corresponds to a DNS SRV record.

                The ``+srv`` automatically enables TLS/SSL.

      b) Enter a Hostname.

         In the :guilabel:`Host` field, enter the hosts or hostname of the server 
         where the deployment is running.

         If you are running your deployment locally, this value is ``localhost``. 
         If you are connecting to an Atlas cluster, see 
         :atlas:`Connect to Database Deployment </connect-to-database-deployment/>` 
         for Atlas-specific guidance on how to connect with |compass-short|.

         If you are not sure of your hostname, contact your Database 
         Administrator for information.

      c) (Optional) Enable Direct Connection. 

         When you use the ``mongodb`` Connection String Scheme, you have the 
         option to enable a :driver:`Direct Connection 
         </node/current/fundamentals/connection/#direct-connection>`. When you 
         enable this setting, |compass-short| runs all operations on the specified 
         host.

         .. important::
            When you specify ``directConnection`` and connect to a secondary member 
            of a replica set, your write operations fail because it is not the 
            primary member.

   .. step:: (Optional) For advanced connection configuration options, click the :ref:`Advanced <advanced-connection-tab>` tab.

   .. step:: Click Connect.

   To disconnect from your deployment, see :ref:`<disconnect-tab>`. 

Example
-------

The following example specifies a connection with :manual:`SCRAM-SHA-256
</core/security-scram/>` in the :guilabel:`General` tab. Since the
connection uses the ``mongodb`` connection string scheme to connect to
an Atlas cluster, the connection also enables TLS/SSL.
