This page lets you manage Backup jobs and Backup resources for
each project. The top part of the page displays :guilabel:`Active Jobs`
and the bottom part displays :guilabel:`Stopped Jobs`. The following
fields on the page have a yellow background if delayed:

- :guilabel:`Last Agent Conf`, if older than 1 hour.

- :guilabel:`Last Oplog`, if older than 1 hour before the
  :guilabel:`Last Agent Conf`.

- :guilabel:`Head Time`, if older than 1 hour before
  :guilabel:`Last Oplog`.

- :guilabel:`Last Snapshot`, if older than the snapshot interval
  multiplied by 1.5.

Manage Backup Jobs
------------------

From the :guilabel:`Jobs` page, you can do the following:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Task

     - Procedure

   * - Assign a project to particular set of
       :opsmgr:`Backup Daemons </reference/glossary/#std-term-Backup-Daemon>` or
       :opsmgr:`blockstores </reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-blockstore-database>`.

     - Click the project, select the Daemons or :term:`blockstores
       <blockstore>`, and select :guilabel:`Save Changes`.

   * - View a job's log.

     - Click the name of the job and then click the :guilabel:`Logs`
       link. Contact MongoDB Support if you need help interpreting the
       error message.

   * - View information about a job.

     - Click the job. From the job's page you can access logs, conf
       calls, and other information, and you can download diagnostics.

   * - Move a job to a new Backup Daemon.

     - Click the job. On the job's page, click the
       :guilabel:`Move head` link, select the new
       :opsmgr:`head </reference/glossary/#std-term-head-database>`, and click the
       :guilabel:`Move Head` button.

       .. include:: /includes/head-database-backup-deprecated.rst

   * - Filter the page to display the jobs assigned to a particular
       Daemon or blockstore.

     - Click the name of the Daemon or blockstore.

   * - Toggle whether a job :term:`journals <journal>` its
       :opsmgr:`head database </reference/glossary/#std-term-head-database>`.

     - Select or clear :guilabel:`Journal Head` to turn on or off
       journaling for your head database.

       Changing this setting at the job level overrides the
       deployment-wide setting.

       See :setting:`mms.backup.journal.heads` for how to enable or
       disable journaling for all head databases in your project.

.. _admin-manage-backup-resources:

Manage Backup Resources
-----------------------

From the :guilabel:`Jobs` page, you can assign Backup resources to a
particular :opsmgr:`project </reference/glossary/#std-term-project>`.

You can make these changes for existing Backups, but only new
:term:`backup jobs <backup job>` will follow the new rules. Making
these changes does not affect existing deployments. For additional
procedural information, see
:doc:`/tutorial/move-jobs-to-new-backup-daemon`.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Task
     - Procedure

   * - Assign a project to particular :opsmgr:`Daemons </reference/glossary/#std-term-Backup-Daemon>`,
       :opsmgr:`blockstores </reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-blockstore-database>`
       or :opsmgr:`oplog stores  </reference/glossary/#std-term-Oplog-Store-Database>`.

     - Click the project to open the project's assignment page; make the
       assignments; select :guilabel:`Save Changes`.

   * - Assign a project to a labelled set of resources.

     - Assign the desired label on the Admin page for each resource. For more information, see
       :ref:`daemons-interface`, :ref:`blockstores <blockstores-page>`,
       and :ref:`oplog-stores-page`.

       Then, on the :guilabel:`Jobs` page:

       1. Click the project name to open the project's assignment page.

       2. In the :guilabel:`Assignment Labels` list box, click
          :guilabel:`Select Labels`.

       3. Select the label. Each selected label must exist on at least
          one Daemon, one blockstore, and one oplog store. If you
          select multiple labels, the resource must meet all selected
          labels.

          Keep in mind that the resource must also meet any other
          selected criteria on this page.

          For example: for a Daemon to match, it must also meet any
          selections you have made in the :guilabel:`Backup Daemon`
          field.

       4. Click :guilabel:`Save Changes`.
        
       Some label changes do not require stopping and restarting backups: 
       
       - Changes that only affect Oplogs only require stopping and restarting running jobs.
       - Changes that only affect Daemons only need a :doc:`move head </tutorial/move-jobs-to-new-backup-daemon>` to move the existing data.
       - Changes that only affect blockstores only need an :ref:`inter groom job <inter-blockstore-groom-job>`.

       :red:`WARNING:` After you change the labels applied to this backup job,
       :ref:`stop and then restart backups <restart-backup>` for this
       deployment. Once Backup restarts, |onprem| changes the
       :opsmgr:`oplog store  </reference/glossary/#std-term-Oplog-Store-Database>` assigned to this
       Backup job. The oplog store matches the job's assigned
       labels to an oplog store with the same
       :ref:`assigned labels <edit-oplogstore>`. This change halts
       new and removes existing
       :opsmgr:`point-in-time restores </reference/glossary/#std-term-point-in-time-restore>` until
       |onprem| takes the next snapshot after reassigning the oplog
       store.

   * - :ref:`Configure a project to use KMIP <configure-group-kmip>`.
     - Specify the |kmip| fields and click :guilabel:`Save Changes`.

.. _transition-s3:

Transition an S3-Compatible Snapshot Store
------------------------------------------

From the :guilabel:`Jobs` page, you can transition between 
S3-compatible snapshot stores without terminating the backup.

After you transition to another S3-compatible snapshot store, the 
existing snapshots remain in the previous store until they expire and 
the :ref:`groom job <grooms-page>` removes them. All new snapshots are 
stored on the newly selected store, starting with a full snapshot. If a 
snapshot is in progress at the time of transition, it will complete on 
the current store, and the transition will take effect with the next 
scheduled snapshot.
