Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to retrieve the
distinct values of a specified field across a collection.

Within a collection, different documents might contain different values for a
single field. For example, one document in a ``restaurants`` collection has a
``borough`` value of ``"Manhattan"``, and another has a ``borough`` value of
``"Queens"``. By using the {+driver-short+}, you can retrieve all the unique values
that a field contains across multiple documents in a collection.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this collection
from your Scala application, create a ``MongoClient`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following values to your ``database`` and ``collection`` variables:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/distinct.scala
    :language: scala
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-db-coll
    :end-before: end-db-coll

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Retrieve Distinct Values
------------------------

To retrieve the distinct values for a specified field, call the ``distinct()``
method and pass the name of the field you want to find distinct values for.

Retrieve Values Across a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example retrieves the distinct values of the ``borough`` field in
the ``restaurants`` collection:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/read/distinct.scala
      :start-after: start-distinct
      :end-before: end-distinct
      :language: scala
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      Bronx
      Brooklyn
      Manhattan
      Missing
      Queens
      Staten Island

The operation returns an instance of the ``DistinctObservable`` class, which
you can iterate through to access each distinct ``borough`` field value. Although
several documents have the same value in the ``borough`` field, each value appears
in the results only once.

Retrieve Values Across Specified Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide a **query filter** to the ``distinct()`` method to find distinct
field values within a subset of documents in a collection. A query filter is an expression
that specifies search criteria used to match documents in an operation. For more information
about creating a query filter, see the :ref:`scala-specify-query` guide.

The following example retrieves the distinct values of the ``borough`` field for
all documents that have a ``cuisine`` field value of ``"Italian"``:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/read/distinct.scala
      :start-after: start-distinct-with-query
      :end-before: end-distinct-with-query
      :language: scala
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :visible: false

      Bronx
      Brooklyn
      Manhattan
      Queens
      Staten Island

Modify Distinct Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify the behavior of the ``distinct()`` method by chaining
methods provided by the ``DistinctObservable`` class. The following
table describes some of these methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``collation()`` 
     - | Sets the collation to use for the operation.
       | **Parameter Type**: ``Collation``

   * - ``comment()`` 
     - | Attaches a comment to the operation.
       | **Parameter Type**: ``BsonValue`` or ``String``

   * - ``first()``
     - | Retrieves only the first distinct field value.

The following example retrieves the distinct values of the ``name`` field for
all documents that have a ``borough`` field value of ``"Bronx"`` and a
``cuisine`` field value of ``"Pizza"``. Then, it chains the ``comment()``
method to ``distinct()`` to add a comment to the operation:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable:

   .. input:: /includes/read/distinct.scala
      :start-after: start-distinct-with-comment
      :end-before: end-distinct-with-comment
      :language: scala
      :dedent:

   .. output:: 
      :visible: false

      $1.25 Pizza
      18 East Gunhill Pizza
      2 Bros
      Aenos Pizza
      Alitalia Pizza Restaurant
      Amici Pizza And Pasta
      Angie'S Cafe Pizza
      ...
