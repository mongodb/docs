     - writable by the ``mongodb-mms`` user.

        Once the connection string is saved, any change to the string requires
        you to restart all |onprem| instances, including those running
        enabled Backup Daemons. Making the change and clicking
        :guilabel:`Save` is not sufficient. |onprem| will continue to use the
        previous string until you restart the instances.

     .. list-table::

        * - :guilabel:`Use SSL`

          - Check this if the database uses SSL. If you select this, you
