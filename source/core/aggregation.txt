Aggregation Concepts
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB provides the three approaches to aggregation described here,
each with its own strengths and purposes for a given situation. This
section describes these approaches and also describes behaviors and
limitation specific to the pipeline. See also the :doc:`chart
</reference/aggregation-commands-comparison>` that compares the
approaches

   Aggregation Pipeline
   --------------------

.. only:: website

   .. class:: toc

      :doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline`
         Describes the :ref:`aggregation pipeline
         <aggregation-pipeline>` and the :ref:`expressions
         <aggregation-expressions>` that calculate values within the
         pipeline.
