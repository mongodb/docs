You can enable autocomplete for {+mcli+} commands to see available
commands and their syntax directly in your shell.

Enable Autocomplete
-------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Homebrew Installation 
      :tabid: Homebrew

      If you installed the {+mcli+} with Homebrew, autocomplete
      functionality is included with the installation. You must
      configure your shell to enable its completion support. To enable
      autocomplete for your shell, refer to the
      `Homebrew Documentation
      <https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion>`__.

   .. tab:: Other Installation
      :tabid: non-Homebrew

      If you did not install the {+mcli+} with Homebrew, the procedure
      to enable autocomplete depends on the shell in which you
      run the {+mcli+}.
      
      Z Shell
      ~~~~~~~

      If you use ``zsh`` to run the {+mcli+}, run the following command
      to enable autocomplete in your current shell:
       
      .. code-block:: sh
         
         % echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

      To enable autocomplete for all future shell sessions:
      
      1. 
         
         - If you use MacOS, run the following command:
            
           .. code-block:: sh
           
              % mongocli completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_mongocli
  
         - If you use Linux, run the following command:
         
           .. code-block:: sh
         
              % mongocli completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_mongocli"
         
      #. Start a new shell for the setup to take effect.
       
      Bash
      ~~~~

      If you use Bash to run the {+mcli+}, install the ``bash-completion`` 
      package via your OS's package manager. Then,
      run the following command to enable autocomplete in your current shell:
      
      .. code-block:: sh
         
         $ source <(mongocli completion bash) 

      To enable autocomplete for all future shell sessions:   

      1. 
      
         - If you use MacOS, run the following command:
         
           .. code-block:: sh
            
              $ mongocli completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/mongocli
      
         - If you use Linux, run the following command:
         
           .. code-block:: sh
         
              $ mongocli completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/mongocli
         
      #. Start a new shell for the setup to take effect.
    
      Fish
      ~~~~
      
      If you use ``fish`` to run the {+mcli+}, run the following command 
      to enable autocomplete in your current shell:

      .. code-block:: sh
            
         > mongocli completion fish | source

      To enable autocomplete for all future shell sessions: 

      1. Run the following command:    
         
         .. code-block:: sh
            
            > mongocli completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/mongocli.fish

      #. Start a new shell for the setup to take effect.
          
      PowerShell
      ~~~~~~~~~~

      If you use PowerShell to run the {+mcli+}, run the following command
      to enable autocomplete in your current shell:

      .. code-block:: sh

         PS C:\> mongocli completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

      To enable autocomplete for all future shells, add the output 
      of the above command to your PowerShell profile. To learn how 
      to edit a PowerShell profile, see `Windows Documentation 
      <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/ise/how-to-use-profiles-in-windows-powershell-ise?view=powershell-7.1>`__.
 
Use ``Tab`` to Autocomplete Commands
------------------------------------

Once you have autocomplete configured, you can autocomplete commands by
typing ``mongocli`` in your shell and pressing the :kbd:`Tab` key. Press
:kbd:`Tab` multiple times to cycle through available autocompletion
options.

You can press :kbd:`Tab` at any stage of writing your command to see
available autocomplete options.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

When you type ``mongocli`` in your shell and press :kbd:`Tab`, the
output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   atlas          -- Atlas operations.
   cloud-manager  -- Cloud Manager operations.
   completion     -- Generate shell completion scripts
   config         -- Configure a profile to store access settings for your MongoDB deployment.
   help           -- Help about any command
   iam            -- Organization and projects operations.
   ops-manager    -- Ops Manager operations.

If you type a specific property such as ``atlas`` as part of your
command, you can see autocompletion options for your selected
property.

For example, when you type ``mongocli atlas`` in your shell and press
:kbd:`Tab`, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   accessLists  -- Manage the IP access list for your project.
   accessLogs   -- Manage the access logs of a cluster.
   alerts       -- Manage alerts for your project.
   backups      -- Manage backups for your project.
   clusters     -- Manage clusters for your project.
   dbusers      -- Manage database users for your project.
   events       -- Manage events for your project.
   logs         -- Download host logs for your project.
   metrics      -- Get measurements on the state of the MongoDB process.
   processes    -- Manage MongoDB processes for your project.
