Overview
--------

Data in MongoDB has a flexible schema. :term:`Collections <collection>`
do not enforce a rigidly-defined :term:`document` structure and the
schema of a collection is not defined or available for inspection within
the database. MongoDB's flexible schema and rich document structure make
developers more productive, but they also make it difficult to explore
and understand the underlying data and its structure without first
executing queries in the shell against the database.

MongoDB Compass is a tool designed to allow users to easily analyze and
understand their schema within MongoDB without having to connect to a
shell or be familiar with the query syntax. It provides users with a
graphical view of their MongoDB schema by randomly sampling a subset of
documents from the entire collection. By sampling a subset of documents,
MongoDB Compass has minimal impact on the performance of the database
and can produce results to the user very quickly. For more information
on sampling, see the :ref:`compass-faq` section.

Getting Started
---------------

MongoDB Compass currently runs on Mac OS X and Windows. Software
requirements to run Compass are listed below:

.. include:: /includes/fact-compass-platforms.rst

On Windows, Compass also requires .NET 4.5+.

To download Compass, see the `downloads page
<https://www.mongodb.com/download-center>`_.

Installing on OS X
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Compass package is downloaded as a .dmg disk image. After the
download, open the disk image and drag the Compass application to the
Applications folder.

.. figure:: /images/compass/osx-install-dialog.png

The installation is now complete and the disk image can be safely
unmounted. Compass can be launched from the Applications directory.

Installing on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Compass setup application is downloaded as a .exe executable file.
Run the program to begin the setup process, which will automatically
install Compass.

Compass requires the **Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5 or later**.
If it is not already installed on the system, the setup program will
prompt to automatically install .NET.

Starting Compass

Data Types
----------

Types and Missing Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compass displays the data types of fields in a collection's schema. The
example below reports that there are documents in the collection that
contain a field ``last_login`` with the type ``date``:

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-example.png
   :figwidth: 330px

Compass also displays a percentage breakdown for fields with varying
data types across documents. In this example, 81% of documents store
``phone_no`` as a ``string``, and the remaining 19% store it as a
``number``:

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-percentage-breakdown.png
   :figwidth: 330px

For sparse fields, where some documents omit a value, Compass displays
the percentage of missing values as ``undefined``. Here, the ``age``
field is missing in 40% of the sampled documents.

.. figure:: /images/compass/field-sparsity.png
   :figwidth: 330px

Understanding Charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compass displays different charts for data fields depending on their :term:`BSON
type <bson types>`.

Strings
*******

:term:`Strings <bson types>` can be displayed in three different ways.
If all the documents in the collection have unique strings for a given
field, Compass will display a random selection of string values. Click
on the refresh icon to generate a new set of random strings sampled from
the values for that field.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-random-sample.png

If there are only a handful of unique string values, Compass will show the
strings in a single graded bar, indicating the percentage breakdown of string
values.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-percentage-breakdown.png

When there are many different string values with some duplication,
Compass displays a histogram indicating the frequency of each string
found for that field. Hover the mouse on each histogram bar to see a
tool tip indicating the value of the string.

.. figure:: /images/compass/string-histogram.png

Numbers
*******

:term:`Numbers <bson types>` are displayed in a similar manner to strings. A
randomly-sampled subset of data is shown for an entirely unique data set.

.. figure:: /images/compass/number-random-sample.png

For a data set of numbers containing duplicates, a histogram is shown to
indicate frequency.

.. figure:: /images/compass/number-histogram.png

Sub-documents
*************

:term:`Sub-document <document>` fields are displayed with a small
triangle next to the field name, along with some additional data.

.. figure:: /images/compass/subdocument.png

Click on the triangle to expand the field and view the sub-documents contained
within.

.. figure:: /images/compass/subdocument-expanded.png

Arrays
******

Fields containing an :term:`array <bson types>` are displayed with the
type distribution of the array's elements. A second type distribution
bar is displayed beneath the ``array`` type.

.. figure:: /images/compass/array-subtypes-array.png

Click on an array sub-type to view a chart of the data for that specific
type.

.. figure:: /images/compass/array-subtypes-boolean.png

Dates and ObjectIDs
*******************

Bar charts are used to represent :term:`dates <bson types>`. They are also used
for fields containing an :term:`ObjectID <objectid>`, from which a date can be
extracted.

The two charts on the top row visualize the date's data: the first is the day of
the week of the timestamp, and the second is the hour of day. The third chart in
the bottom row displays the range of timestamps: the earliest date, the most
recent date and the distribution of all timestamps in between.

.. figure:: /images/compass/dates-chart.png

Coordinates
***********

When Compass detects values that look like geographical coordinates, it
displays the data in a scatter plot. Both :term:`GeoJSON` documents and
:term:`legacy coordinate pairs` are supported.

Hover over points in the scatter plot with the mouse cursor to see a
tooltip displaying latitude and longitude coordinates.

.. figure:: /images/compass/coordinate-scatter-plot.png

Mixed Types
***********

When a field has mixed types throughout a collection, the type of chart
displayed can be changed by clicking on a specific data type underneath
the field name.

As an example, this ``phone_no`` field is a mix of strings and numbers.
The chart displayed shows the values that are strings.

.. figure:: /images/compass/mixed-types-string.png

Click on the ``number`` data type to view the values that are numbers
instead.

.. figure:: /images/compass/mixed-types-number.png

Building Queries
----------------

There are two methods of building queries in Compass: automatic
generation with the query builder, or manual entry in the query bar.

Using the Query Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/steps/compass-query-builder.rst

Manual Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the automatic query builder, queries can be manually
entered into the query bar. It is also possible to manually edit queries
built from the automatic query builder for further refining.

.. include:: /includes/steps/compass-manual-queries.rst

Query Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The query is executed on the full collection. If the result set is
larger than the ``sampleSize`` threshold (100 documents), then a random
subset of ``sampleSize`` documents is chosen from the result set and
displayed in the UI.

Viewing Documents
-----------------

Documents can be examined in the document viewing pane. This can be
expanded by clicking on the Document Viewer icon on the right-hand side
of the page.

.. figure:: /images/compass/document-viewer-icon.png

By default, the pane displays all of the documents sampled by Compass.
If a query is specified in the query bar, only documents that match the
query are shown.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

What is the performance impact of running this tool?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing has shown that Compass has minimal impact in prototype
deployments, though additional performance testing and monitoring is in
progress.

For best results, use MongoDB 3.2, which includes the
:pipeline:`$sample` operator for efficient sampling on a collection. On
older versions of MongoDB, Compass falls back on a :ref:`less efficient
sampling method <compass_fallback_sampling>`.

It is recommended to only execute queries that are appropriately indexed
in the database to avoid scanning the entire collection.

What is sampling and why is it used?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sampling in Compass is the procedure of selecting a subset of data from
a particular collection and analyzing the documents within the sample
set.

Sampling is a common technique in statistical analysis because analyzing
a subset of the data gives similar results to analyzing all of it. In
addition, sampling allows results to be generated quickly rather than
performing a computationally-expensive collection scan.

How does sampling work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compass employs two distinct sampling mechanisms.

In MongoDB 3.2, collections are sampled with the :pipeline:`$sample`
operator via the :doc:`/core/aggregation-pipeline`. This provides
efficient random sampling without replacement over the entire
collection, or over the subset of documents specified by a query.

.. _compass_fallback_sampling:

In MongoDB 3.0 and 2.6, collections are sampled via a
backwards-compatible algorithm executed entirely within Compass. It
takes place in three stages:

1. Compass opens a cursor on the desired collection, limited to at most
   10000 documents sorted in descending order of the ``_id`` field.
2. ``sampleSize`` documents are randomly selected from the stream. To
   do this efficiently, Compass employs `reservoir sampling
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling>`_.
3. Compass performs a query to select the chosen documents directly via
   ``_id``.

``sampleSize`` is set to 100 documents.

Note that the choice of sampling method is done transparently in the
background, with no changes required by the user.

Won't sampling miss documents?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sampling is chosen for its efficiency: the amount of time required to
perform a sample is minimal, on the order of a few seconds. Increasing
the sample confidence will demand more processing power and time.
Furthermore, sophisticated outlier detection requires an inspection of
every document in a MongoDB deployment, which would be unfeasible for
large data sets. The MongoDB team is in the process of conducting user
tests on large data sets to find a reasonable balance.
