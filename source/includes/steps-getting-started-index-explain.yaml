   The :data:`~explain.cursor` value of ``"BasicCursor"`` indicates
   that the server had to perform a :term:`collection scan`.

   The :data:`~explain.n` indicates that ``4`` documents that match the
   query.

   Because MongoDB performed a collection scan, the
   :data:`~explain.nscannedObjects` value indicates the number of
   documents read from the collection.

   The :data:`~explain.nscanned` indicates the number of documents
   scanned from the collection.

   So, without an index to support the query, the query plan indicates
   that ``15`` documents were read to return ``4`` matching documents.

   For more information on the fields in the returned document, see the
   :manual:`Explain Output Reference
   </reference/method/cursor.explain/#explain-output-fields>`.

   The :data:`~explain.cursor` value of ``"BtreeCursor
   items.sku_1_status_1"`` indicates that to fulfill the query, the
   server used an index, specifically an index named
   ``items.sku_1_status_1``.

   Because MongoDB used an index, the :data:`~explain.nscannedObjects`
   indicate the number of index entries read.

   As before, :data:`~explain.n` indicates that number of documents
   that match the query, and :data:`~explain.nscanned` indicates the
   number of documents scanned from the collection.

   This query plan indicates that the server read ``4``
   index entries and the associated ``4`` documents from the collection
   to return ``4`` matching documents. With the index, the server needs
   to scan fewer documents to fulfill the query.
