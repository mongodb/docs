You can configure |service| to send metric data about your
project to your |datadog| dashboards.

.. note::

   If you configure your |service| project to send alerts and events
   to Datadog, you do not need to follow this procedure. |service|
   sends project metrics to Datadog through the same integration used
   to send :ref:`alerts and events <notification-options>`.

You can also configure |datadog| to receive |service| alerts. To learn
more, see :ref:`notification-options`.

Required Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To integrate |service| with Datadog, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` access
to the project. Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must add 
themselves to the project as a ``Project Owner``.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|datadog| integration is available only on ``M10+`` clusters.

To integrate |service| with Datadog, you must have a Datadog account
and a Datadog |api| key. Datadog grants you an |api| key when you first
create a Datadog account.

If you do not have an existing Datadog account, you can sign up at
`<https://app.datadoghq.com/signup>`__.

Performance Metrics Available to Datadog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|datadog| tracks the following metric data for your |service|
cluster. The metric names in parentheses are the names used in
the Datadog :abbr:`UI (User Interface)`.

.. important::

   By default, |datadog| does not track high cardinality metric data.
   To enable tracking for these metrics, you must specify the following settings:

   - ``sendDatabaseMetrics``: Tracks database metrics, including
     database names, collection numbers, storage size, and index size.
     These metrics have names prefixed with ``mongodb.atlas.dbstats``.

   - ``sendCollectionLatencyMetrics``: Tracks collection latency metrics,
     including database names, collection names, and latency information about
     commands, operations, and transactions. These metrics have names
     prefixed with ``mongodb.atlas.latencyStats``.

   Enable these settings by using an :oas-atlas-tag:`{+atlas-admin-api+} endpoint
   </Third-Party-Integrations/operation/createThirdPartyIntegration>` or through
   the :ref:`Atlas UI <datadog-procedure>`.

.. include:: /includes/list-table-datadog-metrics.rst

Tags Available to Datadog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The integration creates the following 
`Datadog tags <https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/>`__
on certain metrics:

.. include:: /includes/list-table-datadog-tags.rst

In addition, {+service+} sends user-defined :ref:`custom tags
<configure-resource-tags>` to Datadog. Tags apply only to metrics, not 
alerts.

.. note::

   Sending custom tags to Datadog metrics is an opt-in feature that you 
   enable through the UI or the API. See 
   `Datadog integrations <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/tutorial/datadog-integration/#procedure>`__ 
   to learn more about each procedure.

Datadog Features for Tracking Your |Service| Integration Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|datadog| provides the following features that you can set up to track 
the status of your |service| integration:

No-data Alert
`````````````
`No data alerts in Datadog <https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/configuration/?tab=thresholdalert#no-data>`__
notify you when a metric is not reporting data under normal 
circumstances. This feature helps you identify issues with your
|service| integration such as changes in performance, API Key issues, or broken connections.



Service Checks
``````````````
`Service Checks in Datadog <https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/service_checks/#overview>`__ 
monitor the status of your |service| integration with |datadog|.
This feature monitors whether a consistent cadence metric is unavailable for a 
specified number of consecutive times. If the Service Check sends an alert, 
your |service| integration has an issue.
