============================
Enable Client Authentication
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Enabling authentication on a MongoDB instance restricts access to the
instance by requiring that users identify themselves when connecting. In
this procedure, you enable authentication and then create the instance's
first user, which must be a user administrator. The user administrator
grants further access to the instance by creating additional users.

When you enable authentication prior to creating a user, you can access
the instance only through the :ref:`localhost exception
<localhost-exception>`, which allows access only through a local client.
MongoDB disables this access after you create the user administrator.

Considerations
--------------

If you create the user administrator before enabling authentication,
MongoDB disables the :ref:`localhost exception <localhost-exception>`.
In that case, you must instead enable authentication through the following procedure:
:doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication-without-bypass`.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-authentication.rst

Next Steps
----------

If you need to disable authentication for any reason, restart the process
without the :setting:`auth` or :setting:`keyFile` option.
