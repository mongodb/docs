Introduction
------------

|service| provides several ways to monitor your cluster's performance:
performance metrics, alerts, and MongoDB logs.

Performance Metrics
-------------------

|service| collects metric data on the performance of your databases and your
MongoDB processes and displays the information in diagnostic charts. Use this
data to monitor the health of your system and make changes when you have
reached capacity.

See :doc:`monitor-cluster-metrics`.

Alerts
------

|service| issues alerts when collected metrics reach thresholds that could
affect your cluster's performance. |service| sends alerts on certain metrics
by default, but you can create additional alert configurations according to
your needs. See:

- :doc:`/respond-to-alerts`

- :doc:`/configure-alerts`

.. _mongodb-logs:

MongoDB Logs
------------

Each of your cluster's MongoDB processes reports a live account of its
activity to a log file. |service| collects real-time log information from each
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` process.

To view logs, click :guilabel:`Clusters`, then click the :guilabel:`MongoDB
Logs` tab. Refresh the browser window to view updated entries. For information
on log messages, see :manual:`Log Messages </reference/log-messages>` in the
MongoDB manual.

You can optionally disable log collection for the group. |service| continues
to display previously collected log entries. To disable log collection for the
group, click :guilabel:`Settings`, then :guilabel:`Group Settings`." Then set
the :guilabel:`Collect Logs For All Hosts` option to :guilabel:`Off`.
