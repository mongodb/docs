Normally, MongoDB splits a :term:`chunk` after an insert if the chunk
exceeds the maximum :ref:`chunk size <sharding-chunk-size>`. However,
you may want to split chunks manually if:

- you have a large amount of data in your cluster and very few
  :term:`chunks <chunk>`, as is the case after deploying a cluster using
  existing data.

- you expect to add a large amount of data that would initially reside
  in a single chunk or shard. For example, you plan to insert a large
  amount of data with :term:`shard key` values between ``300`` and
  ``400``, *but* all values of your shard keys are between ``250`` and
  ``500`` are in a single chunk.

.. note::

   MongoDB provides the :dbcommand:`mergeChunks` command
   to combine contiguous chunk ranges into a single chunk. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/merge-chunks-in-sharded-cluster` for more
   information.

The :term:`balancer` may migrate recently split chunks to a new shard
immediately if the move benefits future insertions. The balancer does
not distinguish between chunks split manually and those split
automatically by the system.

.. include:: /includes/warning-splitting-chunks.rst

Use :method:`sh.status()` to determine the current chunk ranges across
the cluster.

To split chunks manually, use the :dbcommand:`split` command with either
fields ``middle`` or ``find``. The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell provides the
helper methods :method:`sh.splitFind()` and :method:`sh.splitAt()`.

:method:`~sh.splitFind()` splits the chunk that contains the *first*
document returned that matches this query into two equally sized chunks.
You must specify the full namespace (i.e. "``<database>.<collection>``")
of the sharded collection to :method:`~sh.splitFind()`. The query in
:method:`~sh.splitFind()` does not need to use the shard key, though it
nearly always makes sense to do so.

.. example::

   The following command splits the chunk that contains the value of
   ``63109`` for the ``zipcode`` field in the ``people`` collection of
   the ``records`` database:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.splitFind( "records.people", { "zipcode": "63109" } )

Use :method:`~sh.splitAt()` to split a chunk in two, using the queried
document as the lower bound in the new chunk:

.. example::

   The following command splits the chunk that contains the value of
   ``63109`` for the ``zipcode`` field in the ``people`` collection of
   the ``records`` database.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      sh.splitAt( "records.people", { "zipcode": "63109" } )

.. note:: :method:`~sh.splitAt()` does not necessarily split the chunk
   into two equally sized chunks. The split occurs at the location of
   the document matching the query, regardless of where that document is
   in the chunk.
