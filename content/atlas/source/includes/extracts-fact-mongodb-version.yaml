   The following table lists the versions of MongoDB that are available
   for each cluster type.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      
      * - MongoDB Version
        - Available on ``M10+``
        - Available on ``M0`` and Flex Clusters

      * - MongoDB 7.0
        - :icon:`check-square`
        - 

      * - MongoDB 8.0
        - :icon:`check-square`
        - :icon:`check-square`

      * - Latest Release (auto-upgrades)
        - :icon:`check-square`
        - 

   .. important::
    
      If your cluster runs a release candidate of MongoDB, 
      |service| will upgrade the cluster to the stable release 
      version when it is generally available.

   To use a :manual:`rapid release </reference/versioning/>` 
   MongoDB version, you must select :guilabel:`Latest Release` for 
   auto-upgrades. You can't select a specific rapid release version.

   As new patch releases become available, |service| upgrades to
   these releases via a rolling process to maintain cluster
   availability. During the upgrade to the next rapid release version, 
   the {+cluster+} card in the |service| UI :guilabel:`Database 
   Deployments` page might show the |fcv-link| of your {+cluster+} 
   instead of the MongoDB version to reflect the features that are 
   currently available on your {+cluster+}.

   To learn more about how |service| handles end of life of major
   MongoDB versions, see :ref:`atlas-eol-upgrade`

   |service| always upgrades the cluster to the latest patch release of
   the specified major version. The upgrade uses a rolling update
   process to maintain cluster availability.
   
   You can't downgrade the cluster to an earlier MongoDB version unless 
   you pinned the cluster's |fcv| before upgrading.

   You can switch from using the :guilabel:`Latest Release` to using a
   specific release only if the latest MongoDB version is a major
   release.
