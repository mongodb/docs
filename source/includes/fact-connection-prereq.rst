TLS/SSL 
   Clients must have support for TLS/SSL to connect to an |service| cluster.

   Clients must have support for the `SNI
   <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066#section-3>`_ TLS extension to connect
   to an |service| ``M0`` Free Tier or ``M2/M5`` shared starter cluster.
 
Whitelist
   To access a cluster, you must connect from an IP address on the |service|
   project's IP whitelist. If you need to add an IP address to the whitelist,
   you can do so in the :guilabel:`Connect` dialog. You can also add the IP
   address from the :ref:`Security tab <add-to-whitelist>`.
