Overview 
--------

|service| moves infrequently accessed data from your |service| cluster
to a MongoDB-managed read-only :ref:`Federated Database Instance 
<atlas-data-federation>` on a cloud object storage. Once |service| 
archives the data, you have a unified view of your |service| and 
{+Online-Archive+} data through a read-only {+fdi+}.

|service| archives data based on the criteria you specify in an
archiving rule. The criteria varies based on the type of collection 
you want to archive:  

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Standard Collection
      :tabid: standard

      For standard collections, the criteria can be one of the 
      following:

      - A combination of a date field to archive data and number of 
        days to keep data on the |service| cluster. When the current 
        date exceeds the value of the specified date field, |service| 
        subtracts the number of days from the current time and then 
        archives data after the time.
      - A custom query. |service| runs the query specified in the 
        archiving rule to select the documents to archive.

   .. tab:: Time Series Collection 
      :tabid: timeseries 

      .. include:: /includes/fact-oa-timeseries-preview.rst

      For :manual:`time series </core/timeseries-collections/>` 
      collections, the criteria is a combination of a time field and 
      number of days to keep data on the |service| cluster. When the 
      current time exceeds the value of the specified time field, 
      |service| subtracts the number of days from the current time and 
      then archives data after that many days, hours, and minutes.

When you configure an {+Online-Archive+} on your {+cluster+}, |service|
creates 2 {+fdi+}\s: 

- {+FDI+} for your archive that allows you to query data on your
  archive only. 
- {+FDI+} for your {+cluster+} and archive that allows you to query both
  your {+cluster+} and archived data.

.. _online-archive-cluster-reqs:

Cluster Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*{+Online-Archive+}*  in |service| is available only on ``M10`` and
greater clusters.

.. _online-archive-permissions:

Required Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create or delete an {+Online-Archive+}, you must have one of these
roles:

- :authrole:`Project Data Access Admin` role
- :authrole:`Project Cluster Manager` role
- :authrole:`Project Owner` role

.. _online-archive-job:

How |service| Archives Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To archive data:

1. For each archive, |service| runs a query in the archive's namespace to
   identify the documents that match the criteria for archiving.
   |service| refers to this query on a particular archive's namespace as
   a *job*. 
   
   By default, |service| runs the job every five minutes. If the size of
   documents to archive doesn't meet the threshold, |service| expands
   the job interval by five minutes, up to a maximum of four hours. If
   the job interval reaches the maximum or if the size of documents to
   archive reaches the threshold, |service| runs the job again and
   resets the job interval to five minutes. The threshold is 2GB per
   job. 
   
   |service| might initiate the job from any node in the
   {+cluster+}. However, since the job might need to perform 
   delete operations, it always connects to the :term:`primary` 
   member.

   If you specify a time window when you want to run the job, 
   |service| runs the job continuously during that time window. If 
   a running job doesn't complete during the time window, |service| 
   continues to run the job until it completes. If all archiving jobs 
   reach the maximum threshold for either the size or number of 
   documents to archive during three consecutive archive windows, we 
   recommend that you increase the frequency.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-online-archive-index-sufficiency-warning.rst

2. For documents that match the archival criteria, |service|:

   a. Writes to up to a maximum of 10,000 partitions per data archiving 
      job.

   b. Writes up to 2GB of document data to partitions on the cloud 
      object storage for each unique combination of query field values 
      except dates, which are grouped during each run to reduce the 
      number of partitions.

   c. Writes each subsequent quantity of document data (up to 2 GB)
      with each query run. 

.. note:: 

   The interval between each archival job is five minutes. |service|
   runs the next archival job five minutes after the currently running
   job completes. The time it takes to complete an archival job depends
   on a number of factors including the {+cluster+} resources.  

{+Online-Archive+} runs on your |service| {+cluster+} and uses the
same underlying resources, such as |iops|. The default limit of 2GB per
job prevents the operation from using too many resources. If your 
{+cluster+} is currently satisfying workloads at the edge of its
resource limits, you could push it past its capacity by activating 
{+Online-Archive+}. Ensure that your |service| {+cluster+} has excess 
resources before activating {+Online-Archive+}.

If you activate {+Online-Archive+}, you can select one of the following
regions to store your archived data.  

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: AWS 
      :tabid: aws

      .. include:: /includes/list-table-adf-supported-aws-regions.rst

   .. tab:: Azure 
      :tabid: azure

      .. include:: /includes/list-table-adf-supported-azure-regions.rst

.. important::

   |service| encrypts your archived data using `Amazon's server-side
   encryption S3-managed keys (SSE-S3)
   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`__
   for archived data. It can't use any encryption-at-rest encryption 
   keys you might have used on your {+cluster+} data. 

When you archive data, |service| first copies the data to the cloud 
object storage and then deletes the data from your |service| {+cluster+}. 
During archival, for a brief period of time, you might see duplicate
documents on your |service| {+cluster+} and the {+Online-Archive+}. But 
after the archival and when your {+Online-Archive+} state is ``idle``,
the already archived documents won't be present in your |service|
{+cluster+}.  

:manual:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger/>` doesn't release the
storage blocks of the deleted data back to the OS for performance
reasons. However, |service| eventually automatically reuses these
storage blocks for new data. This helps the |service| {+cluster+} to avoid
fragmentation. To learn more, see :manual:`How do I reclaim disk space in WiredTiger? 
</faq/storage/#how-do-i-reclaim-disk-space-in-wiredtiger>`.

Your {+Online-Archive+} is read-only. |service| doesn't *update*
archived data. You can configure deletion of archived data after a
certain period of time. To purge archived data, configure the
:guilabel:`Deletion Age Limit` setting for your {+Online-Archive+} when
you :ref:`create <config-online-archive>` or :ref:`modify
<edit-online-archive>` the {+Online-Archive+}. |service| doesn't sync
your {+Online-Archive+} with the |service| {+cluster+} to maintain
consistency after the data is archived. 

|service| provides a unified endpoint. You can use it to query all
databases and collections on your live {+cluster+} and archived data using
the same database and collection name that you use in your |service|
cluster. You can't use the unified endpoint over a 
:doc:`Network Peering Connection </security-vpc-peering>`, but you can 
:ref:`set up a private endpoint <oa-config-private-endpoint>` or use a
standard internet connection over |tls|.

.. note:: 

   Configuring an {+Online-Archive+} doesn't eliminate the need for a 
   backup policy. We recommend that you configure a backup policy that
   meets your requirements. To learn more about configuring a backup
   policy, see :ref:`backup-cloud-provider`.

.. _adf-online-archive:

{+adf+} for {+Online-Archive+}
----------------------------------------

When you configure your ``M10`` or greater |service| {+cluster+} for
{+Online-Archive+}, |service| creates a read-only :ref:`Federated 
Database Instance <atlas-data-federation>`, one per cluster, for your 
archived data.

.. _adf-oa-limitations:

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

{+Online-Archive+} doesn't support the following:

- Writing to the {+Online-Archive+}.
- :ref:`Configuring <config-adf>` or
  :ref:`administering <adf-cli>` the {+Online-Archive+} {+fdi+} through
  the |service| console, {+adf+} :ref:`CLI <adf-cli>`, or {+adf+} API.
- Archiving a capped collection.
- Archiving data below the size of 5 MiB after 7 days. To learn more, see 
  :ref:`Limitations <config-online-archive-limitations>`.
- :ref:`GridFS <gridfs>`.
  
.. _online-archive-view:

Viewing the {+Online-Archive+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view your {+fdi+} for the {+Online-Archive+}:

1. Log in to the |service| console.

2. Click :guilabel:`Data Federation` from the left navigation in your
   :guilabel:`Project` page.

.. _query-online-archive:

Querying the {+Online-Archive+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query your {+Online-Archive+} data, use the connection string
through the {+Online-Archive+} or {+fdi+} :guilabel:`Connect` button to 
connect to the {+fdi+}.

You can also query your {+Online-Archive+} data with :abbr:`SQL 
(Structured Query Language)`. To learn more, see 
:ref:`query-with-sql`.

.. _query-limits-for-online-archive:

Managing Query Limits for {+Online-Archive+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure limits on the amount of data that is processed for
your queries against archived data to control the data processing
costs for your {+Online-Archive+}. When the amount of processed data
reaches any applicable configured limit, |service| won't execute any new
queries and returns an error to the client application that a limit has
been reached. You can also optionally configure query termination to
terminate queries that exceed the limit. To learn more,
see :ref:`adf-manage-query-limits`.

.. _online-archive-edit:

Editing {+Online-Archive+}s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once |service| creates the {+Online-Archive+}, you can't change the 
archiving criteria from :guilabel:`Date Match` to :guilabel:`Custom 
Filter`, or vice versa.

.. _online-archive-deletion:

Deleting {+Online-Archive+}s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you delete all the {+Online-Archive+}s, |service| deletes the
{+fdi+}s. After deleting all the {+Online-Archive+}s, if you create
an {+Online-Archive+} with the same settings as a deleted
{+Online-Archive+}, |service| creates a new {+fdi+} for the new
{+Online-Archive+}.

.. _online-archive-pricing:

{+Online-Archive+} Costs
------------------------

{+Online-Archive+} stores infrequently accessed data to lower the data 
storage costs on your |service| cluster. However, you incur costs for 
amount of data that you transfer and query. To learn more,
see :ref:`atlas-online-archive-billing`.

.. _online-archive-mgmt:

Manage Your {+Online-Archive+}
------------------------------

You can configure an {+Online-Archive+} for a collection on your
{+cluster+} through your |service| console and |api|. Once you create an
{+Online-Archive+}, you can: 

- :ref:`View the list of Online Archives <view-online-archive>`.
- :doc:`Configure the connection method, standard or private endpoint, 
  for your Online Archive </online-archive/connect-to-online-archive>`
- :ref:`Edit an archiving rule <edit-online-archive>`.
