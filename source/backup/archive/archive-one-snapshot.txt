|service| provides a mechanism for downloading cloud provider,
{+old-backup+}, and M2/M5 snapshots as compressed files.

The downloaded files consist of the raw files copied from the data 
directory. ``mongorestore`` is incompatible with these files. To access 
the data files, use the following procedure to start a 
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and point it to the extract directory.
