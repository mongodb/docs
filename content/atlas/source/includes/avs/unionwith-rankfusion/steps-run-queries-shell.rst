                   embeddings by using the  ``COMEDY_INVOLVING_GHOSTS``
                   variable.

                   the ``HUMOR_INVOLVING_PARANORMAL`` variable.

               - Limits the returned results to 20 documents.

         {+avs+} merges the results for both the queries into a single
         result set. In the results:
         
         - The ``scoreDetails.value`` shows the raw score from that
           pipeline before it is weighted and combined by using
           reciprocal rank fusion.  
         - The ``score.details.rank`` shows the rank of the document in
           the results of the pipeline. 
         - The ``scoreDetails.details.value`` contains the weighted
           reciprocal rank score. 
           
         You can do the following: 
         
         - Adjust the weights assigned to each pipeline in the query to
           further refine the results. 
         - Increase the number of documents in the results if you see
           disjoint results.

         For example, the first and second documents in the results
         suggest a significant match for the term in the ``title``
         field. You can do the following: 
         
         - Adjust the weights assigned to each pipeline in the query to
