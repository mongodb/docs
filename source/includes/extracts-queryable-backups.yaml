   |mms| provisions these queryable snapshots as *read-only* MongoDB
   instances. Specifically, |mms| spins up a :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` with
   data from the selected snapshot store.

   .. important::

      By default, these instances are available for up to 24 hours. You
      can configure the duration using
      :setting:`Expiration (Hours) <Expiration (Hours)>`.
      For other queryable backup settings, see
      :ref:`queryable-snapshot-settings`.

  To query a snapshot of a :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`, the
  :opsmgr:`Backup Daemon </reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-daemon>` requires at least one worker for the
  :manual:`config server</core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`, one
  worker for each :manual:`shard </reference/glossary/#std-term-shard>`, and one worker for the
  :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

  To query a snapshot of a :manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`, the Backup Daemon
  requires at least one worker for the replica set.

  .. example::

     If you restore a queryable backup from a 3-shard cluster with
     1 shard router (:manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>`), you would need this value to
     be at least ``5``:

     - 1 per shard (``3``) +
     - 1 for the config server (``1``) +
     - 1 for the :binary:`~bin.mongos`

     When the queryable backup begins, the Backup Daemon spins
     up 5 or more workers to manage these components.

ref: queryable-backup-pem-restriction
content: |

   :setting:`Proxy Server PEM File` has the following restrictions:

   - The PEM should use a key length greater than 512-bit. Using a
     2048-bit RSA key is recommended.

   - The PEM should use a message digest stronger than ``sha1``, such as ``sha256``.

ref: queryable-backup-certificate-duration
content: |

   The client X.509 certificate is valid for the same length of time as
   the queryable instance :setting:`Expiration (Hours)`,
   which is 24 hours by default.
