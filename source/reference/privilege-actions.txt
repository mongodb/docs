Privilege Actions
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. Commenting out for now. seems like an inversion of the last sentence
   of the following paragraph and raises questions about privileges and roles
   But agree in principle that we could add a
   first sentence that packs more punch and directly state what these
   actions are. 
   Privilege actions, or simply "actions," are used to define
   the privileges found in roles.

MongoDB uses role-based authorization to give users access to data and
commands. Roles provide privileges to users, where privileges specify
the actions permitted on a :ref:`resource <resource-document>`. This
page lists the actions available for defining
:data:`~admin.system.roles.privileges`.

Actions For User and Role Management Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.5.3

MongoDB provides :ref:`user and role management commands
<user-management-commands>`, which require proper authorization to use
in order to prevent privilege escalation attacks. 

.. TODO rewrite following sentence which is currently a placeholder to
   make some distinction between these actions and the list at the end.

The following actions relate to privileges needed to perform :ref:`user
and role management commands <user-management-commands>`:

.. authaction:: createUser

   The user can create new users in the given database.

.. authaction:: createRole

   The user can create new roles in the given database.

.. authaction:: dropUser

   The user can remove any user from the given database.

.. authaction:: dropRole

   The user can delete any role from the given database.

.. authaction:: grantRole

   The user can grant any role in the database to any user from any
   database in the system.

.. authaction:: revokeRole

   The user can remove any role from any user from any database in the
   system.

.. authaction:: changeOwnPassword

   Users with this action can change their own passwords.
   Grant :authaction:`changeOwnPassword` on the ``cluster`` resource.

.. authaction:: changeAnyPassword

   The user can change the password of any user in the given database.

.. authaction:: changeOwnCustomData

   Users with this action can change their own custom information, as
   stored in the ``customData`` field of documents in the :data:`admin.system.users`
   collection. Grant :authaction:`changeOwnCustomData` on the ``cluster``
   resource.

.. authaction:: changeAnyCustomData

   The user can change the custom information of any user in the given
   database. MongoDB stores custom information in the ``customData`` field of
   the documents in :data:`admin.system.users` collection.

.. authaction:: viewUser

   The user can view the information of any user in the given database.

.. authaction:: viewRole

   The user can view information about any role in the given database.

Actions For Database Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO FOR 2.6 - Update the actions the final 2.6 code, which is expected to have
   fewer actions than those listed here. For each action, indicate the types of
   resources it acts on. -BG

.. TODO rewrite the following placeholder. Also, not only should these
   actions

The following actions relate to privileges needed to perform various
database operations:
