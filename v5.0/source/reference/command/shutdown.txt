.. dbcommand:: shutdown

   The :dbcommand:`shutdown` command cleans up all database resources
   and then terminates the process.  You must issue
   the :dbcommand:`shutdown` command against the :term:`admin database`.

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-no-free-or-m10.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({ 
      shutdown: 1,
      force: <boolean>
      timeoutSecs: <int>,
      comment: <any>
   })

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes these fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80
 
   * - Field
     - Description
 
   * - :ref:`shutdown <shutdown-cmd-shutdown>`
 
     - .. _shutdown-cmd-shutdown:
       
       Specify ``1``.
 
   * - :ref:`force <shutdown-cmd-force>`
     - .. _shutdown-cmd-force:
     
       Optional. Specify ``true`` to force the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
       or :binary:`~bin.mongos` to shut down. Force shutdown
       interrupts any ongoing operations on the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
       or :binary:`~bin.mongos` and may result in unexpected
       behavior.

       You can pause and resume in-progress index builds using 
       ``force``. See :ref:`cmd-shutdown-replica-set` for more 
       information.
 
   * - :ref:`timeoutSecs <shutdown-cmd-timeoutSecs>`
     - .. _shutdown-cmd-timeoutSecs:
     
       Optional.
       
       .. _shutdown-cmd-quiesce-period:
 
       .. |force| replace:: :ref:`force <shutdown-cmd-force>`
       .. |timeout| replace:: :ref:`timeoutSecs <shutdown-cmd-timeoutSecs>`

   :method:`db.shutdownServer()`


Behavior
--------

For a :binary:`~bin.mongod` started *with* :ref:`authentication`, 
you must run :dbcommand:`shutdown` over an authenticated connection. 
See :ref:`cmd-shutdown-access-control` for more information.

For a :binary:`~bin.mongod` started *without* :ref:`authentication`,
you must run :dbcommand:`shutdown` from a client connected to the 
localhost interface. For example, run :binary:`~bin.mongosh` with 
the :option:`--host "127.0.0.1" <mongosh --host>` option on the
same host machine as the :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

.. _cmd-shutdown-replica-set:

``shutdown`` on Replica Set Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:dbcommand:`shutdown` fails if the replica set member is running
certain operations such as :ref:`index builds
<index-operations-replicated-build>`. You can specify 
:ref:`force: true <shutdown-cmd-force>` to force the member 
to save index build progress to disk. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` 
recovers the index build when it restarts and continues from the 
saved checkpoint.

Shutting Down the Replica Set Primary, Secondary, or ``mongos``
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/quiesce-period.rst

.. warning::

   Force shutdown of the primary can result in the 
   :ref:`rollback <replica-set-rollback>` of any writes not 
   yet replicated to a secondary. 

.. _cmd-shutdown-access-control:

Access Control
--------------

To run :dbcommand:`shutdown` on a :binary:`~bin.mongod` enforcing 
:ref:`authentication`, the authenticated user *must* have the 
:authaction:`shutdown` privilege. For example, a user with the 
built-in role :authrole:`hostManager` has the appropriate permissions.

Examples
--------

Shut down a ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({ "shutdown" : 1 })

Force Shut Down a ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({ "shutdown" : 1, "force" : true })

Shut Down a Primary ``mongod`` With Longer Timeout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({ "shutdown" : 1, timeoutSecs: 60 })
