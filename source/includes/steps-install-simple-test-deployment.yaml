ref: set-up-server
content: |

  **15 GB memory and 50 GB disk space**:
  The server must have 15 GB of memory and 50 GB of disk space for the
  root partition. You can meet the size requirements by using an Amazon
  Web Services EC2 ``m3.xlarge`` instance and changing the size of the
  root partition to 50 GB. When you log into the instance,
  execute ``df -h`` to verify the root partition has 50 GB of space.

  **Root access**: You must have root access to the server.

ref: application-package-download
content: |
  a. In a browser, go to `http://www.mongodb.com/download
     <http://www.mongodb.com/download>`_.

  b. On the :guilabel:`MongoDB Ops Manager Downloads` page, copy the link
     address of the :guilabel:`RPM` link.

  c. Open a system prompt.

  d. Download the |onprem| package by issuing a ``curl`` command that uses
     the copied link address:

     .. code-block:: sh

        curl -OL <link-address-for-ops-manager-rpm>

     The downloaded package is named ``mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.rpm``,
     where ``<version>`` is the version number.

  The install creates the following:

  - The base directory for the |onprem| software, which is:

    ``/opt/mongodb/mms/``

  - A new system user, ``mongodb-mms``, under which the server runs.

  - The ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties`` file, which contains the connection string to access the Application Database. The default is ``locahost``, port ``27017``, so no changes are necessary.

  a. Create the following directory to store the :term:`head databases
     <head database>`. Do not use this directory for any other purpose:

  b. Issue the following to make the directory writable by the ``mongodb-mms`` user:

     .. code-block:: sh

        sudo chown mongodb-mms:mongodb-mms /data/backupDaemon

  c. In |onprem|, while logged in as the user you registered during installation,
     click the :guilabel:`Admin` link at the top right of the page.

  d. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

  e. Follow the prompts to configure the Backup Daemon and Backup storage.
     |onprem| walks you through the configuration. For :term:`snapshot
     storage <snapshot>`, select either the local filesystem or the Backup
     Database. Whichever choice you make, |onprem| still uses the Backup
     Database for :term:`oplog storage <Oplog Store Database>`. At the
     prompt to configure the connection string to the Backup Database,
     enter the following:
