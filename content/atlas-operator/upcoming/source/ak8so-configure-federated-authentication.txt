Leverage Federated Authentication from Kubernetes

   :description: Configure federated authentication in Atlas Kubernetes Operator by updating the `AtlasFederatedAuth` Custom Resource to manage role mappings and organization settings.

|ak8so| supports using :ref:`federated authentication
<atlas-federated-authentication>` for your |service| organization. 

.. note:: 

   You can't use |ak8so| to set up an |idp|. To set up an |idp|, see
   :atlas:`Configure Database Deployment Authentication and
   Authorization </security/config-db-auth>`.  
   
   Once you set up your |idp|, you can manage the role mappings that
   authenticate users to use your |idp|.

To configure federated authentication through the |ak8so|, you must 
specify and update the :ref:`atlasfederatedauth-custom-resource`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-federated-auth.rst

The :ref:`atlasfederatedauth-custom-resource` is **not** required to 
map database users to an |idp|, both any existing authentication |idp| or 
workload and workforce |idp|. You can use the :ref:`AtlasDatabaseUser <atlasdatabaseuser-custom-resource>` 
custom resource to manage database users, in which you specify the 
authentication method used for a given database user. The 
:ref:`AtlasDatabaseUser <atlasdatabaseuser-custom-resource>` custom 
resource must be configured in conjunction with :ref:`federated authentication
<atlas-federated-authentication>` to associate users and roles in the 
|idp| with users and groups in MongoDB. 

The :ref:`atlasfederatedauth-custom-resource` 
is optional to use any :ref:`federated authentication
<atlas-federated-authentication>`, provided that you have configured it 
elsewhere in {+service+}.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can use |ak8so| to configure federated authentication,
you must have:

- An existing identity provider (|idp|) linked to |service|. 
  To learn how to link an |idp| to |service|, see 
  :ref:`atlas-manage-fed-auth`.
  
- A |k8s-secret| with :ref:`API keys <about-org-api-keys>` that 
  |ak8so| can use to :ref:`connect <ak8so-access-to-atlas-ref>` to |service|. 
  The API keys must have the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role.

- At least one :ref:`role <user-roles>` within an active |service| organization 
  or the projects in the organization.

Update an Organization Configuration
------------------------------------

To configure federated authentication through the |ak8so|,
update the organization configuration for your federation
by specifying the :ref:`atlasfederatedauth-custom-resource`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-atlasfederatedauth-example.rst

To learn more, see :ref:`atlasfederatedauth-parameters`.

.. note:: 

   The :ref:`spec.roleMappings.roleAssignments 
   <atlasfederatedauth-roleAssignments>` 
   parameter must include at least one organization role
   within the current organization or the projects in 
   the organization.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: sh

   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
   kind: AtlasFederatedAuth
   metadata:
     name: atlas-default-federated-auth
     namespace: mongodb-atlas-system
   spec:
     enabled: true
     dataAccessIdentityProviders:
       - 32b6e34b3d91647abb20e7b8
       - 42d8v92k5a34184rnv93f0c1
     connectionSecretRef:
       name: my-org-secret
       namespace: mongodb-atlas-system
     domainAllowList:
       - my-org-domain.com
     domainRestrictionEnabled: true
     ssoDebugEnabled: false
     postAuthRoleGrants:
       - ORG_MEMBER
     roleMappings:
       - externalGroupName: org-admin
         roleAssignments:
           - role: ORG_OWNER
       - externalGroupName: dev-team
         roleAssignments:
           - role: ORG_GROUP_CREATOR
           - projectName: dev-project
             role: GROUP_OWNER 

   EOF

To check on the status of the update process,
run the following command:

.. code-block::

   kubectl get atlasfederatedauth -o yaml

|ak8so| returns the custom resource and includes a
status section that resembles the following example:

.. code-block::
   :copyable: false

   status:
     conditions:
       - type: Ready
         status: True
       - type: RolesReady
         status: True
       - type: UsersReady
         status: True

To learn about the available parameters for this resource, 
see :ref:`atlasfederatedauth-custom-resource`.
