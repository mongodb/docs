Overview
--------

|mms| sends an alert when a specified :doc:`alert condition
</reference/alerts>` occurs, such as an unresponsive host or an outdated
agent. |mms| defines alert conditions and their notification methods in
":doc:`alert configurations </tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`". You
can view your alerts through the :guilabel:`Activity` tab, as well as through
the alert notification.

When a condition triggers an alert, you receive the alert at regular
intervals until the alert resolves or |mms| cancels it. 
You can acknowledge an
alert for a period of time, but if the alert condition persists, you will again
receive notifications once the acknowledgment period ends.

Alerts resolve when the alert condition no longer applies. For example,
if a replica set's :term:`primary` goes down, |mms| issues an alert that 
the replica set does not have a primary. When a new primary is
elected, the alert condition no longer applies, and the alert will resolve.
|mms| sends a notification of the alert's resolution.

|mms| cancels an alert if the alert configuration that triggered the alert
is deleted, disabled, or edited, or if the open alert becomes invalid.
Some examples of an alert becoming invalid are:

- There is an open "Host Down" alert, and then you delete the target host.

- There is an open "Replication Lag" alert, and the target host becomes the
  primary.

- There is an open "Replica Set Has No Primary" alert for a replica set whose
  name is "rs0," and the target replica set is renamed to "rs1."

When an alert is canceled, |mms| does **not** send a notification and does
not record an entry in the :guilabel:`Activity` tab.

Download the Activity Feed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download the activity feed as a CSV file with comma-separated
values. You can filter the events before downloading. |mms| limits the
number of events returned to 10,000.

Acknowledge an Alert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you acknowledge the alert, |mms| sends no further notifications to the
alert's distribution list until the acknowledgement period has passed or
until the you resolve the alert. The distribution list receives *no*
notification of the acknowledgment.

If the alert condition ends during the acknowledgment period, |mms| sends
a notification of the resolution.

If you configure an alert with PagerDuty, a third-party incident
management service, you can only acknowledge the alert on your PagerDuty
dashboard.
