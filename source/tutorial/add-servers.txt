==================
Add Servers to MMS
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Before you can deploy and manage MongoDB instances through MMS, you must
add the servers on which MongoDB will run. You can do this in three ways:

- Provision the machines through Amazon Web Services (AWS). MMS provides
  integration with AWS and lets you deploy new EC2 instances directly from
  the MMS interface. To use EC2 instances for your deployments, you must
  do the following:

  - :doc:`/tutorial/configure-aws-settings`

  - :doc:`/tutorial/provision-aws-servers`

- Use existing systems and infrastructure. MMS can deploy and manage
  MongoDB on your existing servers. To use your existing hardware, you
  must deploy the Automation Agent to each server on which MMS will deploy
  MongoDB. See :doc:`/tutorial/add-existing-hardware`.

- Use your localhost. MMS can deploy MongoDB to your localhost for testing
  purposes. Do not use localhost for production. To deploy to your local
  machine, see :doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-automation-agent`.
