   |service| supports :guilabel:`Real Time` metrics for
   ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` processes and replica
   set clusters. For sharded clusters, you can view 
   :guilabel:`Real Time` metrics for each shard replica set.

   You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner <Project Owner>`
   |service| user role to access the :guilabel:`Real Time` tab.
 
To view Real Time metrics for a specific |service| cluster in a 
:ref:`project <projects>`, click the :guilabel:`Metrics` button 
for that cluster. Alternatively, click on the name of the cluster
to open the cluster overview, then click the 
:guilabel:`Metrics` tab. From the :guilabel:`Metrics` tab,
click :guilabel:`Real Time` to open the 
:doc:`Real-Time Performance Panel 
</real-time-performance-panel>`.

For complete documentation on the |service| real time metrics, 
see :doc:`Real-Time Performance Panel
