Overview
--------

This page contains code examples that show how to connect your PHP application
to MongoDB with various settings.

.. tip::

  To learn more about the connection options on this page, see the link
  provided in each section.

To use a connection example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <php-connect-sample>` or your own application.
Make sure to replace all placeholders in the code examples, such as
``<hostname>``, with the relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.

.. _php-connect-sample:

.. include:: /includes/usage-examples/sample-app-intro.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-sample-app.php
   :language: php
   :copyable: true
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 5-7

.. important:: Percent-Encoding

   You must :wikipedia:`percent-encode <Percent-encoding>` a username and password before
   you include them in a MongoDB URI. You can use the ``rawurlencode()`` method to encode 
   these values according to the URI syntax specified in `RFC 3986 <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3986.html>`__.
   Don't percent-encode the username or password when passing them in an options array
   parameter to the ``MongoDB\Client`` constructor.

Connection
----------

Atlas
~~~~~

The following code shows how to connect to a MongoDB Atlas deployment:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
    :language: php
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-atlas
    :end-before: end-atlas

To learn more about connecting to an Atlas deployment, see :ref:`php-connection-atlas`
in the Connection Targets guide.

Local Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to connect to a local MongoDB deployment:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
    :language: php
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-local
    :end-before: end-local

.. note::

   If you don't specify the ``$uri`` parameter, the connection URI defaults to
   ``'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017'``.

To learn more about connecting to a local deployment, see :ref:`php-connection-local`
in the Connection Targets guide.

Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code shows how to connect to a replica set deployment:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-replica-set-client
         :end-before: end-replica-set-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-replica-set-uri
         :end-before: end-replica-set-uri

.. tip::

   To maintain your connection to a replica set deployment when one
   host is down, you can provide multiple replica set members in the
   connection URI.

To learn more about connecting to a replica set, see :ref:`php-connection-replica-set`
in the Connection Targets guide.

{+stable-api+}
--------------

The following code shows how to enable the {+stable-api+} for the
connection to your MongoDB instance:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
    :language: php
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-stable-api
    :end-before: end-stable-api

To learn more about the {+stable-api+}, see the :ref:`php-stable-api` guide.

Network Compression
-------------------

The following code shows how to specify the Snappy, Zlib, and Zstandard
compression algorithms for a connection:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB\\Client
      :tabid: Client

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-compression-client
         :end-before: end-compression-client

   .. tab:: Connection URI
      :tabid: connectionstring

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/connect-code-examples.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:
         :start-after: start-compression-uri
         :end-before: end-compression-uri

To learn more about network compression, see the :ref:`php-network-compression` guide.
