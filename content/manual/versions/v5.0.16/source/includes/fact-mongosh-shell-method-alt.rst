.. important:: ``mongosh`` Method

   This page documents a :binary:`~bin.mongosh` method. This is *not*
   the documentation for database commands or language-specific drivers,
   such as Node.js. 
   
   For the database command, see the |dbcommand|.

   For MongoDB API drivers, refer to the language-specific
   :driver:`MongoDB driver documentation </>`.

   For the legacy ``mongo`` shell documentation, refer to the
   documentation for the corresponding MongoDB Server release:

   - :v4.4:`mongo shell v4.4 </mongo>`
   - :v4.2:`mongo shell v4.2 </mongo>`
