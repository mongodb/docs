Overview
--------

When you deploy MongoDB as a :term:`replica set` or :term:`sharded
cluster` to a group of servers, |mms| selects one server to run the
Monitoring Agent. If you enable |mms| Backup, |mms| also selects a server to
run the Backup Agent.

You can move the Monitoring and Backup Agents to different servers in the
deployment. You might choose to do this, for example, if you are
terminating a server.

You can add additional Monitoring Agents to distribute monitoring assignments
and to provide failover. |mms| assigns different MongoDB processes to
different Monitoring Agents.

You can add additional Backup Agents as hot standbys for
high availability. However, this is not standard practice. A single
Backup Agent is sufficient and strongly
recommended. If you run multiple Backup Agents, only one
Backup Agent per group or environment is the primary agent and
performs backups. Any other agents are standbys.

Move a Monitoring or Backup Agent to a Different Server
-------------------------------------------------------

To move an agent to a new server, you install a new instance of the agent
on the target server, and then remove the agent from its original server.

Install an Additional Monitoring Agent
--------------------------------------

To use multiple Monitoring Agents to distribute monitoring assignments, you
must run Monitoring Agent version 5.0.0 or higher. For more information, see
:ref:`multiple-monitoring-agents`.

Install an Additional Backup Agent

Using multiple Backup Agents is not standard practice. A single Backup Agent
