You can delete an existing calculated field and remove the field from
your mapping rule. Deleted calculated fields do not update in future
migration job runs.

Steps
-----

#. From the :guilabel:`Mapping` screen, click a table or collection name
   on the :guilabel:`Schema Model` pane or diagram view.

#. Click the pencil icon next to the mapping rule that contains the
   calculated field you want to delete.

#. Click the vertical :guilabel:`...` icon next to the calculated field you want
   to delete.

#. Click :guilabel:`Delete calculated field`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Delete` to confirm you want to delete the field.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save and close`.

The next time that you run a migration job, the deleted field is not updated
in the MongoDB collection.
