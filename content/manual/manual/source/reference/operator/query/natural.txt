.. operator:: $natural

The ``$natural`` operator controls the order in which documents are
returned from a collection. ``$natural`` orders documents based on their
physical order on disk rather than the order defined by an
index.

The natural order typically uses the order in which MongoDB inserts
documents into the database. The order is not guaranteed because of
potential document relocations.

Use in conjunction with :method:`cursor.hint()` to perform a
collection scan to return documents in :term:`natural order`.

For usage, see :ref:`hint-collection-scans` example in the
:method:`cursor.hint()` reference page.

``$natural`` provides access to the underlying document order on disk.
However, you should typically use explicit field sorting.
