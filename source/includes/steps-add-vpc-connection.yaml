   To create the VPC Peering connection, fill in the requested
   information:
      
   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 35 65
      
      * - Field
        - Notes

      * - :guilabel:`AWS Account ID`

        - AWS Account ID of the owner of the peer VPC. Refer to the
          dialog for instructions on finding your :guilabel:`AWS
          Account ID`.

      * - :guilabel:`VPC ID`

        - The ID of the peer VPC. Refer to the dialog
          for instructions on finding your :guilabel:`VPC ID`.
          
          The VPC must be in the same region as the |service| VPC.

      * - :guilabel:`Region`

        - Region for the |service| VPC and peer VPC.
          
          If a :ref:`region-specific VPC <security-vpc>` exists for
          |service|, you cannot modify this value, and the VPC
          associated with the :guilabel:`VPC ID` must be in the same
          region as the |service| VPC.

          Otherwise, select the region for the |service| VPC and the
          peer VPC. A VPC will be created for the |service| group in
          this region, and all clusters for the |service| group will be
          deployed inside this VPC.

      * - :guilabel:`VPC CIDR`

        - The peer VPC CIDR block or subset. Must not overlap with your
          |service| VPC CIDR block or any other peering connection
          :guilabel:`VPC CIDR`.

          The peer CIDR block must be in one of the following private
          networks:

          - ``10.0.0.0/8``

          - ``172.16.0.0/12``

          - ``192.168.0.0/16``
            
          You can choose to add the VPC CIDR block address (or a
          subset) to the whitelist. For VPC peering connections, you
          can also add the Security Group associated with the peer VPC
          instead of the CIDR block. See :ref:`add-to-whitelist`.

      * - :guilabel:`Atlas CIDR Block`

        - The |service| VPC CIDR block. Must not overlap with the
          :guilabel:`VPC CIDR` block.
