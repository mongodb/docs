- An organization with an existing subscription that includes support can only join 
  a paying organization with the same level of support.

- An organization without a subscription can join a paying organization with 
  a :ref:`subscription <subscription-types>` of any type.

- You can link a paying organization to a maximum of 250 other organizations, 
  either manually through the {+atlas-ui+} or :oas-bump-atlas-op:`programatically
  <createorganization>` via the |service| Admin API. 
  To link more than 250 organizations, :ref:`contact support <request-support>`.  

- A paying organization can't already be a linked organization.

- Paying and linked organizations in a cross-org billing configuration:

  - Can't activate self-serve support plans.
  - Can't configure a self-serve marketplace subscription.
  - Share a single support plan (if active).
