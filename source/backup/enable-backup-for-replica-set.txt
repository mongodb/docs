Enable Backup for Specific Replica Set
======================================

.. start-content
   
To backup a replica set, you need to enable the replica set for backup.

.. note::
   The replica set must be MongoDB version 2.0 or later.

To enable the replica set,

#. Go to :guilabel:`Backups`.

#. Click on the :guilabel:`Replica Set` tab to see the list of your
   replica sets and their backup details.

#. For the replica set to enable, select :guilabel:`Enabled` in the
   :guilabel:`Status` column.

#. Specify which instance to use for the initial sync. To
   minimize the impact on the primary, sync off a secondary.

#. Enter authentication code.

Your MongoDB Backup Service Agent will start polling the the specified
instance for this replica set.
