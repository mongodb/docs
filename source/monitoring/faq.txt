Host Configuration
------------------

How do I add a new host or server?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click on the plus icon on the top of the `hosts page
<https://mms.mongodb.com/host/list>`_.

Can I monitor Kerberos-enabled nodes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. |monitoring| does support monitoring for
Kerberos-enabled MongoDB instances. See
:doc:`/monitoring/tutorial/connect-to-hosts-with-kerberos-authentication`
for more information.

.. _db-stats-warning:

How does MMS gather database statistics?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In most instances, |monitoring| will scale its request cycle to limit
more expensive statistics gathering. The information on the DB Stats
tab updates every 10 minutes, and the agent will throttle the frequency
to reduce the impact on the database. [#dbstats-tab]_ Even so, the "DB
stats" operation impacts the performance of your database, as is
possible when installations have a large number of databases and
collections.

If the collection of database statistics impacts database performance, disable
database stats collection. See the "DB Stats" section on the "Settings" page in
the MMS Console before starting your agent.

.. [#dbstats-tab] The DB Stats tab will not appear until 30 minutes
   after you add the host to |monitoring|

|monitoring| Agent
------------------

Do I need a monitoring agent for every MongoDB?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. A single monitoring agent can be used to connect to all MongoDB databases
in your deployment. We strongly recommend you complete your initial monitoring
agent setup with a single monitoring agent.

For redundancy, you may wish to run a second monitoring agent. See the
:ref:`monitoring-architecture` for more information.

Can I use two Monitoring Agents to connect MongoDBs in different data centers?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No. The monitoring agent must connect to every server in your MongoDB
deployment. Configure firewalls to allow the monitoring agent to connect across
data centers and servers.

Use multiple monitoring agents *only* to provide redundancy. Each agent
must be able to connect to every monitored MongoDB. We strongly recommend you
complete your initial monitoring agent setup with a single agent.

What happens if a Monitoring Agent becomes unavailable? How can I ensure my MongoDBs are always monitored?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The monitoring agent is fairly robust, and MMS automatically sends an *Agent
Down* alert when a monitoring agent becomes unavailable. However, once you have
completed your initial MMS setup, a second monitoring agent can be added. If
one monitoring agent fails, the other can continue monitoring.

Please note the second agent has connectivity requirements the same as the
first agent. To support failover from one agent to the next, the second agent
also must connect to every monitored host. If you made firewall adjustments to
allow the first monitoring agent to connect successfully, make the same
adjustments for the second monitoring agent.

See the :ref:`monitoring-architecture` for more information.

Where should I run the Monitoring Agent?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The amount of resources the monitoring agent requires varies depending on
infrastructure size, the number of nodes and the databases it's monitoring. Run
the agent on an existing machine with additional capacity that *does not* run a
:program:`mongod` instance. You may also run the monitoring agent or
on a smaller dedicated instance.

Can I run the Monitoring agent on an AWS micro instances?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you monitor five or fewer ``mongod`` instances, you can use
a AWS micro instance.

Why can't the Monitoring agent connect to my host?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most common problem is that the agent is unable to resolve the
hostname of the server. Check DNS and the ``/etc/hosts`` file.

The second most common problem is that there are firewall rules in
place that prohibit access to the server from the agent.

To test the connection, login to the server running the agent and run:
``mongo hostname:port/test`` If you are unable to connect, the agent
will not be able to connect.

In addition, |monitoring| does currently support monitoring for
Kerberos-enabled nodes: if your host is using Kerberos for
authentication, the |monitoring| Agent will not be able to connect to
it.

How do I download the preconfigured agent?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download a preconfigured agent from the "Agent" section on the MMS
`settings page`_.

.. _`settings page`: https://mms.mongodb.com/settings

How do I setup and configure the agent?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the ``README`` file included in the agent download.

   Can I run the Backup and Monitoring Agents on a Single System?
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. include:: /includes/faq-backup-and-monitoring-agent-on-one-server.rst

Data Presentation
-----------------

What are all those vertical bars in my charts?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *red bar* indicates a server restart.

A *purple bar* indicates the server is now a primary.

A *yellow bar* indicates the server is now a secondary.

How do I magnify dashboard chart data?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click and drag on a dashboard chart, horizontally or vertically, to zoom and
isolate a specific data region. Other charts will automatically zoom to the
same region. Double click on a chart to reset zoom level.

Why is my hostname displayed in orange?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your server either has startup warnings or a `very low ulimit set
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/ulimit/>`_. This can
introduce problems. If your startup warning is about NUMA, see the
`MongoDB documentation <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/>`_. If you have
a ulimit of 1024 or less, see the instructions for `increasing your
ulimit <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/ulimit/>`_.

Why is my Monitoring agent highlighted in red on the Agents tab?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your agent is out of date. For instructions on updating the agent, see:
:doc:`/monitoring/tutorial/update-mms`.

Data Retention
--------------

What is the data retention policy for |MMS|?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data retention policies, as defined in the `Terms of Service`_ are
always subject to change. Currently, |MMS| preserves 3 days of
minute-level data is retained, 94 days of hour data, and unlimited
day-level data.
