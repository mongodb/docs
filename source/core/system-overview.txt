|onprem| Architecture
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

An |onprem| installation includes hosts running |onprem| and hosts
serving and storing application data and snapshots.

.. include:: /images/opsmanager-network-diagram.rst

The |application| requires a dedicated :term:`Application Database` and,
if you enabled backups, :term:`Snapshot Stores <snapshot store>`.

.. _mms-http-service:
.. _application:
.. _mms-application-package:

|application|
-------------

The |application| provides the user interface and the :abbr:`HTTP
(HyperText Transport Protocol)` services the Agents use to transmit data
to and from |onprem|. These are all stateless and start automatically
when the |application| starts. Multiple instances of the |application|
can run if each instance uses the same configuration and application
database. Users and agents can interact with any instance.

By default, the |application| runs on port ``8080`` and contains the web
interface for managing |onprem| users, monitoring of MongoDB hosts, and
managing host backups.

For a list of |onprem|'s default ports and health-check endpoints, see
:doc:`/reference/firewall-configuration`.

.. _backup-daemon:

Backup Daemon Service
---------------------

You can configure any |onprem| instance to run the :term:`Backup Daemon`
service to back up MongoDB databases. The Backup Daemon service manages
the local copies of the backed-up databases and snapshots for each
database. The daemon does scheduled work based on data coming into the
|onprem| from its :term:`Backup Agents <Backup Agent>`. No client
applications can talk directly to the daemon. Its state and job queues
come from the :ref:`mms-application-database`.

The local backup copy of a deployment is called the :term:`head
database`. The :term:`Backup Daemon` stores all its head databases in
its :term:`head directory` path. To create each head database, the
daemon's host acts as an "invisible" :term:`secondary` for each
:term:`replica set` designated for backup.

The daemon takes scheduled snapshots and stores these snapshots in a
:term:`snapshot store`. The daemon retrieves data from the snapshot
store when it receives a restore request. It then delivers the snapshot
to the requested destination.

:ref:`Multiple Backup Daemons <multiple-backup-daemons>` can scale 
horizontally to increase your storage and can provide *manual* 
failover.

If you run multiple Backup Daemons, |onprem| selects the Backup Daemon
to use when a user enables backup for a deployment. The 
:term:`head database` resides with the daemon's host.

Dedicated Storage for Operational Data
--------------------------------------

.. _mms-application-database:

|application| Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|onprem| uses a dedicated MongoDB database to store the |onprem|\'s
operational data. The :term:`application database` runs as a 
:term:`replica set` to ensure redundancy and high availability. This 
replica set hosts *only* |onprem| data. Before installing |onprem|, 
you must :doc:`provision the application database </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>`.
This database contains :ref:`application` metadata:

- Monitoring data collected from Monitoring Agents.

- Metadata for |onprem| users, projects, hosts, monitoring data, and  
  backup state.

For topology and specifications, see 
:ref:`mms-application-database-specifications`.

.. _mms-backup-blockstore-database:

Snapshot Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| creates snapshots of deployments to back up data. You can have
|mms| store these snapshots in 
:term:`snapshot stores <snapshot store>`. Snapshot stores can be local 
databases, local file systems, or cloud-based data stores. There can be
more than one snapshot store per project. |onprem| writes the recent
history of the deployment database to a separate database regardless of
where the snapshots are written.

The components of snapshot storage include:

Snapshot Stores
+++++++++++++++

Snapshots can be written to one of three target storage systems:

- A :term:`Blockstore <Backup Blockstore Database>`: a MongoDB 
  database stored in a local host. To learn about the requirements 
  and procedures for Blockstores, see 
  :doc:`/tutorial/manage-blockstore-storage`.

- An :term:`S3 Snapshot Store`: a cloud data store in 
  :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)` 
  :abbr:`S3 (Simple Storage Service)`. To learn about the 
  requirements and procedures for S3 Snapshot Stores, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/manage-s3-blockstore-storage`.

- A :term:`File System Store <File System Store>`: a local file 
  system in the directory of your choosing. To learn about the 
  requirements and procedures for File System Stores, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/manage-filestore-storage`.

:term:`Oplog Store <Oplog Store Database>`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This store retains :term:`oplog` entries the :term:`Backup Daemon`
applies to its local copies of your backed-up deployments. To learn
about the requirements and procedures for Oplog Stores, see
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-oplog-storage`.
