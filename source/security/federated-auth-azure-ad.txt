This guide shows you how to configure federated authentication 
using |idp-provider| as your |idp|.

After integrating |idp-provider| and |service|, you can use your 
company's credentials to log in to |service| and other MongoDB cloud 
services.

Limitations
-----------

|service| doesn't support single sign-on integration for database users.
To configure |service| to authenticate and authorize database users from
|idp-provider| using |ldap|, see |idp-ldap-link|.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use |idp-provider| as an |idp| for |service|, you must have:

- An |azure| subscription. To obtain a subscription, visit the 
  `Microsoft Azure portal <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/>`__.
- An |idp-provider| tenant associated with your subscription. For 
  information about setting up an |idp-provider| tenant, see the 
  :azure:`Azure AD Documentation </active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant>`.
- A ``Premium P2`` license for |idp-provider|.
- ``Global Administrator`` privileges in your Azure AD tenant.
- A custom, routable domain name.

Procedures
----------

Add Domain users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you haven't already, use the |azure| console to add your custom 
domain name to |idp-provider| and create users:

.. include:: /includes/steps/idp-add-azure-ad-users.rst

Configure |idp-provider| as an Identity Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the |azure| console to configure |idp-provider| as a |saml| |idp|. 
You can either add the MongoDB Cloud app from the Gallery or configure
an application manually.

   tabs:
     - id: integrated
       name: Use the MongoDB Cloud Gallery App

         .. include:: /includes/steps/idp-add-azure-ad-as-idp-gallery.rst

     - id: manual
       name: Configure an App Manually
       content: |

         .. include:: /includes/steps/idp-add-azure-ad-as-idp-manual.rst

Add |idp-provider| as an Identity Provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :guilabel:`Federation Management Console` and the |azure| 
console to add |idp-provider| as an |idp|:

.. include:: /includes/steps/idp-add-azure-ad-to-fmc.rst

.. include:: /includes/map-domain.rst

.. _azure-ad-idp-map-org:

.. include:: /includes/associate-domain-map-org.rst

.. _fed-auth-azure-select-role:

.. include:: /includes/default-org-user-role.rst

Sign in to |service| Using Your Login URL
-----------------------------------------

All users you assigned to the |azure| application can log in to 
|service| using their |idp-provider| credentials on the 
:guilabel:`Login URL`. Users have access to the organizations you 
mapped to your |idp|. 

If you selected a default organization role, new users who log in to
|service| using the :guilabel:`Login URL` have the role you specified.
