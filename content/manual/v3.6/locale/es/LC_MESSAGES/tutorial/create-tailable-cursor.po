"By default, MongoDB will automatically close a cursor when the client has"
" exhausted all results in the cursor. However, for :doc:`capped "
"collections </core/capped-collections>` you may use a *Tailable Cursor* "
"that remains open after the client exhausts the results in the initial "
"cursor. Tailable cursors are conceptually equivalent to the ``tail`` Unix"
" command with the ``-f`` option (i.e. with \"follow\" mode). After "
"clients insert new additional documents into a capped collection, the "
"tailable cursor will continue to retrieve documents."
