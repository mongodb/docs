About this Task
---------------

Dropping an `unnecessary index 
<http://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/schema-design-anti-pattern-unnecessary-indexes/>`_ 
can speed up CRUD operations. Each CRUD operation has to update all the 
indexes related to a document. Removing one index can increase the 
speed of all CRUD operations.  

.. important::

   You should only drop a hashed shard key index from a collection 
   if a supporting non-hashed index on the shard key exists. If a 
   supporting non-hashed index does not exist on the shard key, queries 
   filtering by the shard key perform a :term:`collection scan`.
   To see what indexes exist on a collection, use 
   :method:`db.collection.getIndexes()`.

Considerations
--------------

When dropping a hashed shard key index, consider the following:

- The server disables balancing for your collection and excludes 
  the collection from future balancing rounds. To include 
  the collection in future balancing rounds, recreate 
  the shard key index.
- When you drop the shard key index, the range deleter does not clean up 
  any remaining orphans in your collection. You must confirm that no orphaned
  documents exist in your collection before dropping the hashed shard key index.
  See the below procedure for how to confirm that there are no orphaned documents
  in your collection.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Stop the balancer
  
      Run the following command to stop the balancer:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.stopBalancer()

      You can only run ``sh.stopBalancer()`` on ``mongos``. 
      ``sh.stopBalancer()`` produces an error if run on ``mongod``.

   .. step:: Confirm there are no orphaned documents in your collection

      Starting in MongoDB 6.0.3, you can run an aggregation using the 
      :pipeline:`$shardedDataDistribution` stage to confirm no orphaned 
      documents remain:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.aggregate([ 
            { $shardedDataDistribution: {} },
            { $match: { "ns": "<database>.<collection>" } }
         ])

      ``$shardedDataDistribution`` has output similar to the following:

      .. include:: /includes/shardedDataDistribution-output-example.rst

      Ensure that ``"numOrphanedDocs"`` is ``0`` for each shard in the
      cluster.

   .. step:: Drop the hashed shard key index 

      Run the following command to drop the index:
 
      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.collection.dropIndex("<index name>")

   .. step:: Restart the balancer

      Run the following command to restart the balancer on the cluster:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.startBalancer()
