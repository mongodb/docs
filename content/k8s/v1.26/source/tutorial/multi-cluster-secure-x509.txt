.. _multi-cluster-x509-overview:

You can configure the |k8s-op-short| to use X.509 certificates to authenticate
your client applications in a |multi-cluster|.

To secure your |multi-cluster| with X.509 certificates, you run all actions on
the :ref:`central cluster <central-and-member-clusters>`.
The |k8s-op-short| propagates the X.509 configuration to each member cluster
and updates the |k8s-op-short| configuration on each member cluster.

.. _multi-cluster-x509-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you secure your |multi-cluster| using |tls| encryption, complete the following tasks:

- Follow the steps in the :ref:`Multi-Cluster Quick Start Prerequisites <multi-cluster-prereqs>`.
- Deploy a :ref:`TLS-encrypted multi-cluster <multi-cluster-quick-start-ref>`.
- :ref:`Create credentials for the Kubernetes Operator <create-k8s-credentials>` for the |k8s-op-short|.
