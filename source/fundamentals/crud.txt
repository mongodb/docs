CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations enable you to work with
data stored in MongoDB.

- :doc:`Read Operations </fundamentals/crud/read-operations>` find and return
  documents stored in your database.
- :doc:`Write Operations </fundamentals/crud/write-operations>` insert, modify,
  or delete documents in your database.

..
  Some operations combine aspects of read and write operations. See our
  guide on :doc:`compound operations </fundamentals/crud/compound-operations>`
  to learn more about these hybrid methods.
