   * - Take snapshots every ... hours and save for ... days

     - Sets how frequently, in hours, |mms| takes a base snapshot of
       the deployment and the number of days |mms| retains base
       snapshots.

   * - Store daily snapshots for

     - Sets the number of days that |mms| retains daily snapshots.

   * - Store weekly snapshots for

     - Sets the number of weeks that |mms| retains weekly snapshots.

   * - Store monthly snapshots for

     - Sets the number of months that |mms| retains monthly snapshots.
       
       .. note:: 
          
          |onprem| takes monthly snapshots every 28 days, not by calendar month.
     
   * - Day of Week for Full Snapshot

     - Sets the day of the week when |mms| takes a full snapshot. This
       ensures a recent complete backup.

       |onprem| sets the default value to :guilabel:`Sunday`.

   * - Allow point-in-time restores going back

     - Sets the number of days that |mms| retains oplogs alongside
       snapshots. To learn how snapshots and point-in-time restores work,
       see :ref:`restore-overview`.

   * - Reference Time of Day (UTC)

     - Sets the time of day at
       `UTC <https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html>`_ from
       which the snapshot schedule starts. When you change the value in
       :guilabel:`Reference Time of Day`, snapshots that are in progress
       or that are already scheduled remain unaffected. Only snapshots
       taken after you change the reference time follow the updated schedule.

       The following statements describe how |mms| behaves in relation
       to the value you specify in :guilabel:`Reference Time of Day`:

       - This value acts as a timer that |mms| uses for scheduling and then
         taking the next snapshot. This value isn't the same as the time
         when |mms| takes the next snapshot, but it is close to it. This
         value differs from the actual time that |mms| uses to take a
         snapshot by a small interval. You can't control this interval.
       - If you leave this value blank, |mms| interprets it as ``null``,
         starts the timer for scheduling the next snapshot, and then takes
         the next snapshot after a short interval from the time when it
         took the previous snapshot.
  
       - If you change the time value in this field, |mms| uses the new
         time value as the starting time for scheduling the snapshot that
         will occur *after the currently scheduled snapshot*.
         In other words, for each snapshot that is already scheduled, |mms| uses
         the time it already established: either based on the ``null`` value
         plus a short interval, or based on the custom reference time value
         plus a short interval. If you change the reference time value in
         this field, the next scheduled snapshot will not happen sooner
         than the snapshot that is already scheduled.
