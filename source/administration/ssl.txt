================================
Use MongoDB with SSL Connections
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This document outlines the use and operation of MongoDB's SSL
support. SSL allows MongoDB clients to support encrypted connections
to :program:`mongod` instances.

.. note:: The `default distribution of MongoDB`_ does **not** contain
   support for SSL.

   As of the current release, to use SSL you must either: build
   MongoDB locally passing the "``--ssl``" option to ``scons``, or use
   the `MongoDB subscriber build`_.

These instructions outline the process for getting started with SSL
and assume that you have already installed a build of MongoDB that
includes SSL support and that your client driver supports SSL.

.. _`default distribution of MongoDB`: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads
.. _`MongoDB subscriber build`: http://www.10gen.com/mongodb-subscriber-edition-download

``mongod`` and ``mongos`` SSL Configuration
-------------------------------------------

Add the following command line options to your :program:`mongod` invocation:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --sslOnNormalPorts --sslPEMKeyFile <pem> --sslPEMKeyPassword <pass>

Replace "``<pem>``" with the path to your SSL certificate ``.pem``
file, and "``<pass>``" with the password you used to encrypt the
``.pem`` file.

You may also specify these options in your "``mongodb.conf``" file, as in
the following:

.. code-block:: ini

   sslOnNormalPorts = true
   sslPEMKeyFile = /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
   sslPEMKeyPassword = pass

Modify these values to reflect the location of your actual ``.pem``
file and its password.

You can specify these configuration options in a configuration file
for :program:`mongos`, or start :program:`mongos` with the following
invocation:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongos --sslOnNormalPorts --sslPEMKeyFile <pem> --sslPEMKeyPassword <pass>

You can use any existing SSL certificate, or you can generate your own
SSL certificate using a command that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd /etc/ssl/
   openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out mongodb-cert.pem -keyout mongodb-cert.key

To create the combined ``.pem`` file that contains the ``.key`` file
and the ``.pem`` certificate, use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   cat mongodb-cert.key mongodb-cert.pem > mongodb.pem

Clients
-------

Clients must have support for SSL to work with a :program:`mongod`
instance that has SSL support enabled. The current versions of the
Python, Java, Ruby, Node.js, and .NET drivers have support for SSL, with
full support coming in future releases of other drivers.

``mongo``
~~~~~~~~~

The :program:`mongo` shell built with ssl support distributed with the
subscriber build also supports SSL. Use the "``--ssl``" flag as
follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --ssl --host <host>

MMS
~~~

The MMS agent will also have to connect via SSL in order to gather its
stats.  Because the agent already utilizes SSL for its communications
to the MMS servers, this is just a matter of enabling SSL support in
MMS itself on a per host basis.

Use the "Edit" host button (i.e. the pencil) on the Hosts page in the
MMS console and is currently enabled on a group by group basis by
10gen.

Please see the `MMS Manual <http://mms.10gen.com/help>`_ for more
information about MMS configuration.

PyMongo
~~~~~~~

Add the "``ssl=True``" parameter to a PyMongo
:py:class:`MongoClient <pymongo:pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient>`
to create a MongoDB connection to an SSL MongoDB instance:

.. code-block:: python

   from pymongo import MongoClient
   c = MongoClient(host="mongodb.example.net", port=27017, ssl=True)

To connect to a replica set, use the following operation:

.. code-block:: python

   from pymongo import MongoReplicaSetClient
   c = MongoReplicaSetClient("mongodb.example.net:27017",
                             replicaSet="mysetname", ssl=True)

PyMongo also supports an "``ssl=true``" option for the MongoDB URI:

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://mongodb.example.net:27017/?ssl=true

Java
~~~~

Consider the following example "``SSLApp.java``" class file:

.. code-block:: java

    import com.mongodb.*;
    import javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory;

    public class SSLApp {

        public static void main(String args[])  throws Exception {

            MongoClientOptions o = new MongoClientOptions.Builder()
                    .socketFactory(SSLSocketFactory.getDefault())
                    .build();

            MongoClient m = new MongoClient("localhost", o);

            DB db = m.getDB( "test" );
            DBCollection c = db.getCollection( "foo" );

            System.out.println( c.findOne() );
        }
    }

Ruby
~~~~

The recent versions of the Ruby driver have support for connections
to SSL servers. Install the latest version of the driver with the
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   gem install mongo

Then connect to a standalone instance, using the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   require 'rubygems'
   require 'mongo'

   connection = Mongo::Connection.new('localhost', 27017, :ssl => true)

Replace ``connection`` with the following if you're connecting to a
replica set:

.. code-block:: ruby

   connection = Mongo::ReplSetConnection.new(['localhost:27017'],
                                             ['localhost:27018'],
                                             :ssl => true)

Here, :program:`mongod` instance run on "``localhost:27017``" and
"``localhost:27018``".

Node.JS (``node-mongodb-native``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the `node-mongodb-native`_ driver, use the following invocation to
connect to a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance via SSL:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var db1 = new Db(MONGODB, new Server("127.0.0.1", 27017,
                                        { auto_reconnect: false, poolSize:4, ssl:ssl } );

To connect to a replica set via SSL, use the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var replSet = new ReplSetServers( [
       new Server( RS.host, RS.ports[1], { auto_reconnect: true } ),
       new Server( RS.host, RS.ports[0], { auto_reconnect: true } ),
       ],
     {rs_name:RS.name, ssl:ssl}
   );

.NET
~~~~

As of release 1.6, the .NET driver supports SSL connections with
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances. To connect using
SSL, you must add an option to the connection string, specifying
``ssl=true`` as follows:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var connectionString = "mongodb://localhost/?ssl=true";
    var server = MongoServer.Create(connectionString);

The .NET driver will validate the certificate against the local
trusted certificate store, in addition to providing encryption of the
server. This behavior may produce issues during testing, if the server
uses a self-signed certificate. If you encounter this issue, add the
``sslverifycertificate=false`` option to the connection string to
prevent the .NET driver from validating the certificate, as follows:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var connectionString = "mongodb://localhost/?ssl=true&sslverifycertificate=false";
    var server = MongoServer.Create(connectionString);
