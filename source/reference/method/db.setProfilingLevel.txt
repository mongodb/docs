.. method:: db.setProfilingLevel(level, slowms)

   Modifies the current :term:`database profiler` level used by the
   database profiling system to capture data about performance. The
   method provides a wrapper around the :term:`database command`
   :dbcommand:`profile`.

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-db.setProfilingLevel-param.rst

   The level chosen can affect performance. It also can allow the
   server to write the contents of queries to the log, which might have
   information security implications for your deployment.

   Configure the :setting:`~operationProfiling.slowOpThresholdMs` option to set the threshold
   for the profiler to consider a query "slow." Specify this value in
   milliseconds to override the default, 100 ms.

   :program:`mongod` writes the output of the database profiler to the
   ``system.profile`` collection.

   :program:`mongod` prints information about queries that take longer than
   the :setting:`~operationProfiling.slowOpThresholdMs` to the log even when the database profiler is
   not active.
