Install MongoDB on Red Hat Enterprise, CentOS, or Fedora Linux
==============================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

This tutorial outlines the basic installation process for deploying
:term:`MongoDB` on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS Linux, Fedora
Linux and related systems. This procedure uses ``.rpm`` packages as
the basis of the installation. 10gen publishes packages of the MongoDB
releases as ``.rpm`` packages for easy installation and management for
users of CentOS, Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems. While
some of these distributions include their own MongoDB packages, the
10gen packages are generally more up to date.

This tutorial includes: an overview of the available packages,
instructions for configuring the package manager, the process install
packages from the 10gen repository, and preliminary MongoDB
configuration and operation.

Package Options
---------------

The 10gen repository contains two packages:

- ``mongo-10gen-server``

  This package contains the :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
  daemons from the latest **stable** release and associated
  configuration and init scripts. Additionally, you can use this
  package to :ref:`install daemons from a previous release
  <install-rhel-version-pinning>` of MongoDB.

- ``mongo-10gen``

  This package contains all MongoDB tools from the latest **stable** 
  release. Additionally, you can use this package to :ref:`install tools from a previous 
  release <install-rhel-version-pinning>` of MongoDB. 
  Install this package on all production MongoDB hosts and
  optionally on other systems from which you may need to administer
  MongoDB systems.


Install MongoDB
---------------

Configure Package Management System (YUM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a ``/etc/yum.repos.d/10gen.repo`` file to hold information
about your repository. If you are running a 64-bit system
(recommended,) place the following configuration in
``/etc/yum.repos.d/10gen.repo`` file:

.. code-block:: cfg

   [10gen]
   name=10gen Repository
   baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/x86_64
   gpgcheck=0
   enabled=1

If you are running a 32-bit system, which isn't recommended for
production deployments, place the following configuration in
``/etc/yum.repos.d/10gen.repo`` file:

.. code-block:: cfg

   [10gen]
   name=10gen Repository
   baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/i686
   gpgcheck=0
   enabled=1

Install Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the following command (as ``root`` or with ``sudo``) to install
the latest stable version of MongoDB and the associated tools:

.. code-block:: sh

   yum install mongo-10gen mongo-10gen-server

When this command completes, you have successfully installed MongoDB!

.. _install-rhel-version-pinning:

Manage Installed Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``mongo-10gen`` and ``mongo-10gen-server`` packages to
install previous releases of MongoDB. To install a specific release, append the
version number, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   yum install mongo-10gen-2.2.3 mongo-10gen-server-2.2.3

This installs the ``mongo-10gen`` and ``mongo-10gen-server`` packages
with the ``2.2.3`` release. You can specify any available version of
MongoDB; however ``yum`` **will** upgrade the ``mongo-10gen`` and
``mongo-10gen-server`` packages when a newer version becomes
available. Use the following *pinning* procedure to prevent unintended
upgrades.

To pin a package, add the following line to your ``/etc/yum.conf``
file:

.. code-block:: ini

   exclude=mongo-10gen,mongo-10gen-server

Configure MongoDB
-----------------

These packages configure MongoDB using the ``/etc/mongod.conf`` file
in conjunction with the :term:`control script`.  You can find the init
script at ``/etc/rc.d/init.d/mongod``.

This MongoDB instance will store its data files in the
``/var/lib/mongo`` and its log files in ``/var/log/mongo``, and
run using the ``mongod`` user account.

.. note::

   If you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you will need
   to modify the access control rights to the ``/var/lib/mongo`` and
   ``/var/log/mongo`` directories.

Control MongoDB
---------------

.. warning::

   With the introduction of ``systemd`` in Fedora 15, the control
   scripts included in the packages available in the 10gen repository
   are not compatible with Fedora systems. A correction is
   forthcoming, see :issue:`SERVER-7285` for more information, and in
   the mean time use your own control scripts *or* install using the
   procedure outlined in :doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-linux`.

Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the following command
(as root, or with ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: sh

   service mongod start

You can verify that the :program:`mongod` process has started
successfully by checking the contents of the log file at
``/var/log/mongo/mongod.log``.

You may optionally, ensure that MongoDB will start following a system
reboot, by issuing the following command (with root privileges:)

.. code-block:: sh

   chkconfig mongod on

Stop MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stop the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the following command
(as root, or with ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: sh

   service mongod stop

Restart MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can restart the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the following
command (as root, or with ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: sh

   service mongod restart

Follow the state of this process by watching the output in the
``/var/log/mongo/mongod.log`` file to watch for errors or important
messages from the server.

Control :program:`mongos`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of the current release, there are no :term:`control scripts
<control script>` for :program:`mongos`. :program:`mongos` is only
used in sharding deployments and typically do not run on the same
systems where :program:`mongod` runs. You can use the ``mongodb``
script referenced above to derive your own :program:`mongos` control
script.

SELinux Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must SELinux to allow MongoDB to start on Fedora
systems. Administrators have two options:

- enable access to the relevant ports (e.g. 27017) for SELinux. See
  :ref:`security-port-numbers` for more information on MongoDB's
  default ports.

- disable SELinux entirely. This requires a system reboot and may have
  larger implications for your deployment.

Using MongoDB
-------------

Among the tools included in the ``mongo-10gen`` package, is the
:program:`mongo` shell. You can connect to your MongoDB instance by
issuing the following command at the system prompt:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo

This will connect to the database running on the localhost interface
by default. At the :program:`mongo` prompt, issue the following two
commands to insert a record in the "test" :term:`collection` of the
(default) "test" database and then retrieve that document.

.. code-block:: javascript

   > db.test.save( { a: 1 } )
   > db.test.find()

.. seealso:: ":program:`mongo`" and ":doc:`/reference/method`"
