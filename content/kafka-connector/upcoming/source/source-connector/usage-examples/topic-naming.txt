Overview
--------

The examples on this page show how to configure your {+source-connector+}
to customize the name of the topic to which it publishes records.

By default, the MongoDB Kafka source connector publishes change event data
to a Kafka topic with the same name as the MongoDB **namespace** from which
the change events originated. A namespace is a string that's composed of the
database and collection name concatenated with a dot (``.``) character.

The following sections show different ways that you can customize the
Kafka topics to which the connector publishes change event data:

- :ref:`Topic Prefix <topic-naming-prefix-example>`
- :ref:`Topic Suffix <topic-naming-suffix-example>`
- :ref:`Topic Namespace Map <topic-naming-namespace-map>`

.. _topic-naming-prefix-example:

Topic Prefix
------------

You can configure your source connector to prepend a string to the
namespace of the change event data, and publish records to that Kafka
topic. This setting automatically concatenates your prefix with your
namespace with the "." character.

To specify the topic prefix, use the ``topic.prefix`` configuration
setting as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: ini
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   topic.prefix=myPrefix
   database=test
   collection=data

Once set, your connector publishes any changes to the ``data`` collection
in the ``test`` database to the Kafka topic named ``myPrefix.test.data``.

.. _topic-naming-suffix-example:

Topic Suffix
------------

You can configure your source connector to append a string to the
namespace of the change event data, and publish records to that Kafka
topic. This setting automatically concatenates your namespace with your
suffix with the "." character.

To specify the topic suffix, use the ``topic.suffix`` configuration
setting as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: ini
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   topic.suffix=mySuffix
   database=test
   collection=data

Once set, your connector publishes any changes to the ``data`` collection
in the ``test`` database to the Kafka topic named ``test.data.mySuffix``.

.. _topic-naming-namespace-map:

Topic Namespace Map
-------------------

You can configure your source connector to map namespace values to Kafka
topic names for incoming change event data. Topic namespace maps contain
**pairs** that are made up of a namespace pattern and a destination
topic name template.

The following sections describe how the connector interprets namespaces
and maps them to Kafka topics. In addition to directly mapping databases
and collections to Kafka topics, the connector supports the use of regex
and wildcard pairs in topic namespace maps.

The order of the pairs in your namespace map can affect how the
connector writes events to your topics. The connector matches namespaces
in the following order:

1. Pairs with database and collection names in the namespace pattern. To
   learn more about this namespace pattern, see the :ref:`Database and
   Collection Names <topic-naming-namespace-map-example>` example.
#. Pairs with only a database name in the namespace pattern. To
   learn more about this namespace pattern, see the :ref:`Database and
   Collection Names <topic-naming-namespace-map-example>` example.
#. Regex pairs in order. To learn more about this namespace pattern, see
   the :ref:`Regular Expressions <topic-naming-namespace-map-regex-example>` example.
#. The wildcard pair. To learn more about this namespace pattern, see
   the :ref:`Wildcard <topic-naming-namespace-map-wildcard-example>` example.

.. _topic-naming-namespace-map-example:

Database and Collection Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify the names of specific databases and collections within a
topic namespace map to write change events from these sources to Kafka
topics.

If the database name or namespace of the change event matches one of the
fields in the map, the connector computes the destination topic name
based on the topic name template that corresponds to that mapping and
publishes the event to this topic.

If the database name or namespace of the change event does not match any
mapping, the connector publishes the record using the default topic naming
scheme unless otherwise specified by a different topic naming setting.

.. important::
   
   Because the ``/`` character denotes that the namespace is a
   regex pattern, the connector raises a ``ConnectConfigException``
   if the namespace includes this character in a non-regex context.

Any mapping that includes both database and collection takes precedence
over mappings that only specify the source database name.

.. important::

   The namespace map matching occurs before the connector applies any other
   topic naming setting. If defined, the connector applies the
   ``topic.prefix`` and the ``topic.suffix`` settings to the topic name
   after the mapping.

The following example shows how to specify the ``topic.namespace.map``
setting to define a topic namespace mappings from the ``carDb`` database
to the ``automobiles`` topic name template and the ``carDb.ev``
namespace to the ``electricVehicles`` topic name template:

.. code-block:: ini

   topic.namespace.map={"carDb": "automobiles", "carDb.ev": "electricVehicles"}

Since the ``carDb.ev`` namespace mapping takes precedence over the ``carDb``
mapping, the connector performs the following actions:

- If the change event came from the database ``carDb`` and collection ``ev``,
  the connector sets the destination to the  ``electricVehicles`` topic.
- If the change event came from the database ``carDb`` and a collection
  other than ``ev``, the connector sets the destination to the
  ``automobiles.<collection name>`` topic.
- If the change document came from any database other than ``carDb``, the
  connector sets the destination topic to the default namespace naming
  scheme.
- If you define the ``topic.prefix`` and ``topic.suffix`` settings, the
  connector applies their values to the destination topic name after it
  performs the namespace mapping.

.. _topic-naming-namespace-map-regex-example:

Regular Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use a regular expression (regex) within a
topic namespace map. To use a regular expression, start the namespace
pattern with the forward slash (``/``) character. Create the regular
expression following the syntax and behavior specified by the
``java.util.regex.Pattern`` class.

The connector computes the topic name by doing variable expansion on the
topic name template. The connector supports the following variables: 
 
- ``db``: The database name from the matching namespace.
- ``sep``: The value of the ``topic.separator`` configuration property.
  To learn more about this property, see :ref:`source-configuration-kafka-topic`.
- ``coll``: The collection name from the matching namespace, or an empty
  string if there is no collection name.
- ``sep_coll``: The value of the ``coll`` variable prefixed with the value
  of the ``sep`` variable, or an empty string if the value of ``coll`` is empty.
- ``coll_sep``: The value of the ``coll`` variable suffixed with the
  value of the ``sep`` variable, or an empty string if the value of ``coll`` is empty.
- ``sep_coll_sep``: The value of the ``coll`` variable prefixed and
  suffixed with the value of the ``sep`` variable, or an empty string if
  the value of ``coll`` is empty.
 
If you use any of the previous variables in your topic name template,
you must enclose them in curly brackets (``{}``) for the connector to
expand them. You can't use curly brackets in the topic name template for
any other purpose.

.. note:: Escaping Characters

   When you create a namespace pattern, ensure that you properly handle
   characters that need escaping. For example, to match
   ``.``, the regex syntax requires that you escape it as ``\.``
   However, you must escape the backslash ``\`` character as ``\\``
   according to the JSON syntax. Then, to match ``.`` in your namespace
   pattern, you must write it as ``\\.``.

This example shows how to specify the ``topic.namespace.map``
setting so that the connector performs the following mapping:

- Writes events from databases that match a regular expression to a
  topic computed from the ``industrial{sep_coll}`` topic name template.
  The regex pattern matches any namespace with the ``vertical`` database
  name.

- Writes events from the ``vertical.health`` namespace to the
  ``healthcare`` topic name. In this case, the topic name template and the
  computed topic name are the same.

.. code-block:: ini

   topic.namespace.map={"/vertical(?:\\..*)?": "industrial{sep_coll}", "vertical.health": "healthcare"}

.. note::
   
   In this example, the ``topic.separator`` configuration property is
   ``"."``, the default value.

Because the ``vertical.health`` namespace mapping takes precedence over
the regular expression namespace mapping, the connector performs the
following actions:

- If the change event comes from the ``health`` collection of the
  ``vertical`` database, the connector sets the destination to the
  ``healthcare`` topic.

- If the change event comes from any other namespaces with the ``vertical``
  database name, the connector computes the destination topic based on
  the ``industrial{sep_coll}`` topic name template. The following examples
  demonstrate this mapping:

  - If the change event comes from the ``vertical.wasteManagement``
    namespace, the connector writes to the
    ``industrial.wasteManagement`` topic.
  
  - If the change event comes from the ``vertical``
    database but no specific collection, the connector writes to the
    ``industrial`` topic.

- If the change document comes from any database that doesn't match the
  regex pattern, the connector sets the destination topic to the default
  namespace naming scheme.

- If you define the ``topic.prefix`` and ``topic.suffix`` settings, the
  connector applies their values to the destination topic name after it
  performs the namespace mapping.

.. _topic-naming-namespace-map-wildcard-example:

Wildcard
~~~~~~~~

In addition to specifying database name and namespace in your topic
namespace map as shown in :ref:`<topic-naming-namespace-map-example>`,
you can use a wildcard ``*`` to match change events from all databases and
namespaces without mappings.

.. code-block:: ini

   topic.namespace.map={"carDb": "automobiles", "carDb.ev": "electricVehicles", "*": "otherVehicles"}

In the preceding wildcard example, the connector publishes change documents
that originated from all databases other than ``carDb`` to the
``otherVehicles`` topic.
