   Create a new symmetric key by following the official AWS
   documentation on
   `Creating symmetric KMS keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html#create-symmetric-cmk>`__.      
   The key you create is your {+cmk-long+}.
   Choose a name and description that helps you identify it;
   these fields do not affect the functionality or configuration of your {+cmk-abbr+}.

   In the :guilabel:`Usage Permissions` step of the key generation
   process, apply the following default key policy that enables
   Identity and Access Management ({+aws-iam-abbr+}) policies to
   grant access to your {+cmk-long+}:

   .. literalinclude:: /includes/tutorials/automatic/aws/key-policy-default.json
      :language: json

   .. important:: 

      Record the Amazon Resource Name ({+aws-arn-abbr+}) and Region of
      your {+cmk-long+}. You will use these in later steps of this guide.
