You can configure a local deployment with the 
{+atlas-cli+}. You can use this non-production environment for 
noncritical applications, environments that are not responsible for 
revenue and are not customer-facing, and for development and testing 
purposes.

Use Case for Local Deployments
------------------------------

A local deployment may be best for you if you want to 
develop and test on local {+clusters+}, which reduces costs when 
compared to cloud-hosted development.

If this is your use case, we recommend that you deploy locally 
by using the :atlascli:`{+atlas-cli+} </atlas-cli-deploy-local>`.


Considerations for Local Deployments
------------------------------------

You can use the {+atlas-cli+} only to create cloud deployments
(|service| clusters) and local deployments. Local deployments are 
always a single node.
