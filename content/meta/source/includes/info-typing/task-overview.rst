A task page instructs a user on how to accomplish a particular goal. A
task page can be written for users with any level of experience with
MongoDB. Users might approach a task for the first time, have limited
experience, or need a refresher. A task page should contain all the
necessary information for someone to complete the task, any necessary
conceptual information, prerequisites, steps, and expected results.
