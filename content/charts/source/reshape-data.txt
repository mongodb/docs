Refer to the following pages for ways to reshape your original
data into a form that works best for your charts:

:ref:`calculated-fields`
  Combine data from one or more fields in your collection into
  a single calculated field.

:ref:`convert-field-data-types`
  Convert the data type of the fields in your collection to a different
  type. For example, convert numbers stored as strings to the number
  data type.

:ref:`add-lookup-field`
  Use :manual:`$lookup </reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/>` functionality
  to add a field based on a query across multiple data sources.

  Transform your collection's documents with an aggregation
  pipeline.

:doc:`query-library`
