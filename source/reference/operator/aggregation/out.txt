==================
$out (aggregation)
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 2.6

Definition
----------

.. pipeline:: $out

   Takes the documents returned by the aggregation pipeline and writes
   them to a specified collection. The :pipeline:`$out` operator lets
   the aggregation framework return result sets of any size. The
   :pipeline:`$out` operator must be *the last stage* in the pipeline.

   The command has the following syntax, where ``<output-collection>`` is
   collection that will hold the output of the aggregation
   operation. :pipeline:`$out` is only permissible at the end of the
   pipeline:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.<collection>.aggregate( [
           { <operation> },
           { <operation> },
           ...,
           { $out : "<output-collection>" }
      ] )

   .. important::

      - You cannot specify a sharded collection as the output collection.
        The input collection for a pipeline can be sharded.

      - The :pipeline:`$out` operator cannot write results to a
        :doc:`capped collection </core/capped-collections>`.

Behaviors
---------

Create New Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$out` operation creates a new collection in the current
database if one does not already exist. The collection is not visible
until the aggregation completes. If the aggregation fails, MongoDB does
not create the collection.

Replace Existing Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the collection specified by the :pipeline:`$out` operation already
exists, then upon completion of the aggregation, the :pipeline:`$out`
stage atomically replaces the existing collection with the new
results collection. The :pipeline:`$out` operation does not change any
indexes that existed on the previous collection. If the aggregation
fails, the :pipeline:`$out` operation makes no changes to the pre-existing
collection.

Index Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pipeline will fail to complete if the documents produced by the
pipeline would violate any unique indexes, including the index on the
``_id`` field of the original output collection.

Example
-------

A collection ``books`` contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 8751, "title" : "The Banquet", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 2 }
   { "_id" : 8752, "title" : "Divine Comedy", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 1 }
   { "_id" : 8645, "title" : "Eclogues", "author" : "Dante", "copies" : 2 }
   { "_id" : 7000, "title" : "The Odyssey", "author" : "Homer", "copies" : 10 }
   { "_id" : 7020, "title" : "Iliad", "author" : "Homer", "copies" : 10 }

The following aggregation operation pivots the data in the ``books``
collection to have titles grouped by authors and then writes
the results to the ``authors`` collection.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.books.aggregate( [
                         { $group : { _id : "$author", books: { $push: "$title" } } },
                         { $out : "authors" }
                     ] )

After the operation, the ``authors`` collection contains the following
documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : "Homer", "books" : [ "The Odyssey", "Iliad" ] }
   { "_id" : "Dante", "books" : [ "The Banquet", "Divine Comedy", "Eclogues" ] }
