   Using :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, connect to your primary
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` or, in a sharded cluster, connect to your
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` and authenticate as a user administrator or a
   user with the :ref:`required privileges <add-user-prereq>`:

              :option:`--authenticationDatabase \<database\> <mongosh
              --authenticationDatabase>` command line options:

              Using :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, connect to your database
              deployment:

              .. code-block:: bash

                 mongosh --port 27017

              In :binary:`~bin.mongosh`, switch to the
              authentication database (in this case, ``admin``), and
              use the :method:`db.auth(\<username\>, \<pwd\>)
              <db.auth()>` method to authenticate:

              .. code-block:: javascript

                 use admin
                 db.auth("myUserAdmin", passwordPrompt()) // or cleartext password

title: Create additional users for your deployment
level: 4
stepnum: 2
ref: create-additionalusers
pre: |

  .. note::

     The following step uses :ref:`authentication-scram` authentication.
     For additional information on other authentication mechanisms, see
     :ref:`create-users-examples`.

  After authenticating as the user administrator, use the
  :method:`db.createUser()` method to create additional users. You can assign
  any :ref:`built-in roles <built-in-roles>` or
  :ref:`user-defined roles <user-defined-roles>` to the
  users.

action:
  pre: |
    The following operation adds a user ``myTester`` to the ``test``
    database who has the :authrole:`readWrite` role in the ``test``
    database as well as the :authrole:`read` role in the ``reporting``
    database.

  language: javascript
  code: |
    use test
    db.createUser(
      {
        user: "myTester",
        pwd:  passwordPrompt(),   // or cleartext password
        roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "test" },
                 { role: "read", db: "reporting" } ]
      }
    )

   .. tip::

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/mongosh-password-prompt.rst

   The database where you create the user (in this example, ``test``) is
   that user's :ref:`authentication database
   <user-authentication-database>`. Although the user authenticates to
   this database, the user can have roles in other databases. The
   user's authentication database does not limit the user's privileges.

   After creating the additional users, exit :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

title: Connect to the instance and authenticate as ``myTester``
level: 4
ref: auth-as-mytester
content: |

   .. important::

      It is not possible to switch between users in the same
      :binary:`~bin.mongosh` session. Authenticating as a different user
      means the session has the privileges of **both** authenticated
      users. To switch between users exit and relaunch
      :binary:`~bin.mongosh`.

   After exiting :binary:`~bin.mongosh` as ``myUserAdmin``, reconnect as
   ``myTester``:

              :option:`--authenticationDatabase \<database\> <mongosh
              --authenticationDatabase>` command line options:

                 mongosh --port 27017 -u "myTester" \
                     --authenticationDatabase "test" -p

              Enter the password for the user when prompted.

title: Insert a document as ``myTester``
level: 4
ref: insert-as-mytester
content: |

   As the user ``myTester``, you have privileges to perform read and
   write operations in the ``test`` database (as well as perform read
   operations in the ``reporting`` database). Once authenticated as
   ``myTester``, insert a document into a collection in the ``test``
   database. For example, you can perform the following insert
   operation in the ``test`` database:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.foo.insertOne( { x: 1, y: 1 } )
...
