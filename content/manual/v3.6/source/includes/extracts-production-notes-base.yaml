  MongoDB is compatible with {{software}}.

  {{software}} supports *memory overcommitment*, where you can assign more memory
  to your virtual machines than the physical machine has available. When
  memory is overcommitted, the hypervisor reallocates memory between the
  virtual machines. {{software}}'s balloon driver {{balloonDriverLiteral}} reclaims the
  pages that are considered least valuable.

  The balloon driver resides inside the guest operating system. When the balloon driver expands,
  it may induce the guest operating system to reclaim memory from guest
  applications, which can interfere with MongoDB's memory management and
  affect MongoDB's performance.

  Do not disable the balloon driver and memory
  overcommitment features. This can cause the hypervisor to use its swap which
  will affect performance. Instead, map and reserve the full amount of
  memory for the virtual machine running MongoDB. This ensures that the balloon
  will not be inflated in the local operating system if there is memory
  pressure in the hypervisor due to an overcommitted configuration.
