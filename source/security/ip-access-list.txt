|service| only allows client connections to the {+database-deployment+} from entries in
the project's IP access list. Each entry is either a single IP address
or a |cidr|\-notated range of addresses. For |aws| {+clusters+} with one or
more :ref:`VPC Peering <vpc-peering>` connections to the same |aws|
region, you can specify a Security Group associated with a peered
|vpc|.

For |service| {+clusters+} deployed on :ref:`google-gcp` or
:ref:`microsoft-azure`, add the IP addresses of your |gcp| or |azure|
services to |service| project IP access list to grant those services
access to the {+cluster+}.

The IP access list applies to all {+database-deployment+}s in the project and can have
up to 200 IP access list entries, with the following exception:
projects with an existing sharded {+cluster+} created *before* August 25,
2017 can have up to 100 IP access list entries.

|service| supports creating temporary IP access list entries that
expire within a user-configurable 7-day period.
