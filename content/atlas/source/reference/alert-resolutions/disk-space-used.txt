``Disk Space % Used`` alerts indicate the percentage of used disk space
on a partition reaches a specified threshold.

.. note::

   The UI displays :guilabel:`GB`, but all disk space metrics are in
   gibibytes (GiB).


Alert Conditions Configured by Default
---------------------------------------

|service| configures the following alert conditions by default to help you
ensure dedicated cluster availability and prevent the cluster from going down due
to disk exhaustion on the primary node and to maintain read availability.

- :alert:`Writes have been blocked on your cluster due to critically low disk space <Writes have been blocked on your cluster due to critically low disk space>`
  occurs when the percentage of used disk has exceeded :ref:`write-blocking-thresholds <write-blocking-thresholds>`,
  and |service| has :ref:`blocked writes <cluster-blocking-writes>` to maintain read availability.

  You can view disk metrics through :ref:`Real-Time Performance Panel <real-time-metrics-status-tab>`
  and review :ref:`MongoDB process metrics <review-mongodb-process-metrics>`.

- :alert:`Writes have been unblocked on your cluster <Writes have been unblocked on your cluster>`
  occurs when the percentage of used disk on the primary node has fallen below the
  :ref:`unblocking thresholds <write-blocking-thresholds>`, and |service|
  automatically unblocks writes to the cluster. See also :ref:`Unblocking Writes <unblocking-writes>`.

  This is an information-only alert that doesn't require any action on your part.
  To prevent future write-blocking events, we recommend that you monitor your
  cluster's disk usage. To learn more, see :ref:`Preventing Write-Blocking <write-blocking-prevention>`.

Alert Conditions You Can Configure
----------------------------------

You can configure the following alert condition in the project-level 
:ref:`alert settings <configure-alerts>` page to trigger alerts.

:alert:`Disk space % used on Data Partition
<Disk space % used on Data Partition is>` occurs when the
percentage of disk space used on any partition that contains the
MongoDB collection data meets or exceeds a certain threshold.
:ref:`By default <default-alert-settings>`, the threshold is 90
percent of the cluster's :ref:`configured storage size <scale-cluster>`.

Common Triggers
---------------

The following common events can trigger ``Disk Space % Used`` alerts:

- The percentage of used disk has exceeded :ref:`write-blocking-thresholds <write-blocking-thresholds>`,
  and |service| has :ref:`blocked writes <cluster-blocking-writes>`
  to maintain read availability.

- The disk is full and :ref:`Auto-Expand Storage
  <scale-cluster-storage>` is not enabled.

- Auto-Expand Storage is enabled, but the disk filled too quickly
  for |service| to expand the cluster's storage space. This
  can happen during data migration.

- Auto-Expand Storage is enabled, but |service| cannot expand the
  cluster's storage space because it has reached the maximum storage
  capacity for this cluster. For more information on cluster tier
  limits, see the :ref:`Amazon Web Services <amazon-aws-configuration-options>`,
  :ref:`Google Cloud Platform <google-gcp-configuration-options>`, and
  :ref:`Microsoft Azure <microsoft-azure-configuration-options>`
  instance configuration options.

Fix the Immediate Problem
-------------------------

Consider the following actions to help resolve ``Disk Space % Used``
alerts through the {+atlas-ui+} or API.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Atlas UI
      :tabid: atlas-ui

      - :ref:`Enable Auto-Expand Storage <scale-cluster-storage>`.

        .. note::

    		   If the disk fills too quickly, |service| might not be
    		   able to expand the cluster's storage space in time,
    		   even if Auto-Expand Storage is enabled.

      - Manually increase the :guilabel:`Storage` of this cluster
        in the :guilabel:`Cluster Tier` section of the
        :ref:`configuration page <scale-cluster-storage>`.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: atlas-api

      - :oas-bump-atlas-op:`Enable Auto-Expand Storage
        <updategroupcluster>` using the
        ``autoScaling.diskGBEnabled`` parameter.

        .. note::

    		   If the disk fills too quickly, |service| might not be
    		   able to expand the cluster's storage space in time,
    		   even if Auto-Expand Storage is enabled.

      - :oas-bump-atlas-op:`Increase the storage of this cluster
        <updategroupcluster>` using the
        ``diskSizeGB`` parameter.

        .. note::

           For :guilabel:`Low CPU` and :guilabel:`General` clusters, the 
           UI displays :guilabel:`GB`, but the ``diskSizeGB`` parameter
           value is in gibibytes (GiB).

Implement a Long-Term Solution
------------------------------

Consider the following long-term solutions to help resolve 
``Disk Space % Used`` alerts through the {+atlas-ui+} or API.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Atlas UI
      :tabid: atlas-ui

      If you have reached the maximum storage capacity for this
      cluster, upgrade to a larger cluster tier in the
      :guilabel:`Cluster Tier` section of the 
      :ref:`configuration page <scale-cluster-instance>`.

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: atlas-api

      If you have reached the maximum storage capacity for this
      cluster, :oas-bump-atlas-op:`specify a larger cluster tier
      <updategroupcluster>` using the
      ``replicationSpecs[n].regionConfigs[m].electableSpecs.instanceSize``
      parameter.

Monitor Your Progress
---------------------

You can observe a high percentage of used disk space in the following
ways:

- In the cluster :ref:`metrics <monitor-cluster-metrics>`, the
  :guilabel:`Disk Usage` graph displays the used disk space in
  yellow. This indicates that the used disk space is approximately
  70 percent of the |service| cluster's :ref:`configured storage
  size <scale-cluster-instance>`.

- |service| nodes are unhealthy, because the
  used disk space reached the cluster's
  :ref:`configured storage size <scale-cluster-instance>`.

- The cluster :ref:`blocks writes <cluster-blocking-writes>` and connections from the client.
