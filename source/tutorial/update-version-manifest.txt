You can use Automation to install and upgrade MongoDB instances in your
deployment. You need to give |onprem| a list of which versions can be
installed. The complete list of all possible MongoDB editions and
versions is called the :opsmgr:`version manifest
</reference/glossary/#std-term-version-manifest>`. Ensure that the
MongoDB versions in the version manifest are :ref:`supported
<backup-compatibility>` by the |onprem| version that you are using. You
can't use a version manifest that has newer or older MongoDB versions
than what your |onprem| version supports. 

If you configure the {+mdbagent+} to use remote or hybrid downloads,
|onprem| updates the version manifest automatically.

If you configure the {+mdbagent+} to use local downloads, you must 
update the version manifest manually.

To learn more about **Remote Mode**, **Hybrid Mode**, and **Local 
Mode**, see :ref:`om-modes`.
