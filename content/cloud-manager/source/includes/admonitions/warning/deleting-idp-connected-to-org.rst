.. warning::

   You can still deactivate or delete an |idp| even if it is connected to an
   organization, so long as you are an :authrole:`Organization Owner` in 
   all organizations connected to the |idp|.
   
   Use caution when you deactivate or delete an identity provider that is still
   connected to organizations, as users who rely on that |idp| can immediately
   lose access to those organizations and their projects.
