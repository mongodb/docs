The MongoDB query optimizer processes queries and chooses the most
efficient query plan for a query given the available indexes. The
query system then uses this query plan each time the query runs. The
query optimizer occasionally reevaluates query plans as the content of
the collection changes to ensure optimal query plans.

You can use the :method:`~cursor.explain()` method to view statistics
about the query plan for a given query. This information can help as you
develop :doc:`indexing strategies </applications/indexes>`.

Query Optimization
------------------

To create a new query plan, the query optimizer:

1. runs the query against several candidate indexes in parallel.

#. records the matches in a common results buffer
   or buffers.

   - If the candidate plans include only :term:`ordered query plans
     <ordered query plan>`, there is a single common results buffer.

   - If the candidate plans include only :term:`unordered query plans
     <unordered query plan>`, there is a single common results buffer.

   - If the candidate plans include *both* :term:`ordered query plans
     <ordered query plan>` and :term:`unordered query plans
     <unordered query plan>`, there are two common results buffers, one
     for the ordered plans and the other for the unordered plans.

   If an index returns a result already returned by another index, the
   optimizer skips the duplicate match. In the case of the two buffers,
   both buffers are de-duped.

#. stops the testing of candidate plans and selects an index when one of
   the following events occur:

   - An :term:`unordered query plan` has returned all the matching results; *or*

   - An :term:`ordered query plan` has returned all the matching results; *or*

   - An :term:`ordered query plan` has returned a threshold number of
     matching results:

     - Version 2.0: Threshold is the query batch size. The default
       batch size is 101.

     - Version 2.2: Threshold is 101.

The selected index becomes the index specified in the query plan;
future iterations of this query or queries with the same query
pattern will use this index. Query pattern refers to query select
conditions that differ only in the values, as in the following two
queries with the same query pattern:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find( { type: 'food' } )
   db.inventory.find( { type: 'utensil' } )

Query Plan Revision
-------------------

As collections change over time, the query optimizer deletes the query
plan and re-evaluates after any of the following events:

- The collection receives 1,000 write operations.

- The :dbcommand:`reIndex` rebuilds the index.

- You add or drop an index.

- The :binary:`~bin.mongod` process restarts.

- You run a query with :method:`~cursor.explain()`.
