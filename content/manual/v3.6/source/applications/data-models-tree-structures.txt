MongoDB allows various ways to use tree data structures to model large
hierarchical or nested data relationships.

   :doc:`/tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-parent-references`
      Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
      structure by storing :ref:`references <data-modeling-referencing>`
      to "parent" nodes in "child" nodes.

   :doc:`/tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-child-references`
      Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
      structure by storing :ref:`references <data-modeling-referencing>`
      to "child" nodes in "parent" nodes.

   :doc:`/tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-ancestors-array`
      Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
      structure by storing :ref:`references <data-modeling-referencing>`
      to "parent" nodes and an array that stores all ancestors.

   :doc:`/tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-materialized-paths`
      Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
      structure by storing full relationship paths between documents. In
      addition to the tree node, each document stores the ``_id`` of the
      nodes ancestors or path as a string.

   :doc:`/tutorial/model-tree-structures-with-nested-sets`
      Presents a data model that organizes documents in a tree-like
      structure using the *Nested Sets* pattern. This optimizes
      discovering subtrees at the expense of tree mutability.
