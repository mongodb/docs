To terminate an |service| {+Flex-cluster+} using the 
{+atlas-ui+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps-terminate-flex-cluster.rst

.. warning::

   If you terminate a {+Flex-cluster+} with associated 
   :ref:`tags <configure-resource-tags>` that don't apply to any other 
   {+database-deployment+}, |service| deletes the tags. You can't 
   restore these deleted tags.

|service| terminates the {+Flex-cluster+} after completing any 
in-progress deployment changes.

|service| bills for the operations performed while the 
{+Flex-cluster+} is active. To learn more about |service|
billing, see :ref:`billing`.
