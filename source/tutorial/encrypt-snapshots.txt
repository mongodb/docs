Encrypted Backup Snapshots

Snapshot encryption depends upon which
:manual:`version of MongoDB your database is compatible </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`.
This Feature Compatibility Version ranges from the current version
to one version earlier. For MongoDB 4.4, the FCV can be ``4.2`` or
``4.4``. You can only create encrypted snapshots from encrypted 
clusters.

|mms| doesn't encrypt backup snapshots for clusters running MongoDB 4.2
or later because you can create encrypted snapshots only from encrypted
clusters.

   The :opsmgr:`Backup Daemon
   </reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-daemon>` requires a connection
   to the |kmip| host to process a :doc:`queryable restore job
   </tutorial/query-backup>` of an encrypted backup.

   :manual:`MongoDB Encryption at Rest </core/security-encryption-at-rest/>`

Prerequisites
-------------

A host running |kmip|-compliant key management to generate and store
encryption keys.

.. important::

   Clusters must use |kmip| servers. These clusters don't support local
   key management using files.

.. important::

   You must maintain all keys, even rotated keys, in the |kmip| host.

   All deployments in the project use the same |kmip| client
   certificate file to authenticate.

Encrypt Your Backup Job
-----------------------

You can create encrypted snapshots only from encrypted clusters. If you
enable MongoDB Encryption at Rest for the host you are backing up, the
bytes that |mms| copies to the snapshot store are already encrypted.
