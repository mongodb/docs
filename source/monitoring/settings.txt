Settings
========

The "Settings" section of the MMS console enables users to personalize
their console and activate or deactivate a variety of features.


Personalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Personalization page allows users to configure the console 
to suit their needs and preferences. 

- **Chart Refresh**: sets the rate at which the data displayed in the
  charts on your dashboards or on the "Hosts Statistics" page refreshes.

- **Default Chart Display Type**: sets the default metric that will
  appear in your charts. You can choose from the average per second, or
  the total. This determines what "display" is selected by default on
  the "Hosts Statistics" and "Dashboard" pages.

- **Default Chart Epoch Type**: sets the scale for the chart data, 
  either 1 day, 1 hour, 5 minutes, or 1 minute. This determines what
  "resolution" is selected by default on the "Host Statistics" and 
  "Dashboard" pages.

- **Default Chart Window**: sets the time period displayed by default 
  in the charts on the "Hosts Statistics" and "Dashboard" pages.

- **Default Dashboard**: sets which dashboard will be displayed by
  default on the "Dashboard" page. You can select from a list of all of
  your dashboards.

- **Homepage**: sets which page of the MMS console you will see when
  you log into MMS. You can choose from the "Hosts" page, or the
  "Dashboard" page.

- **Separate Opcounter Charts**: allows you to control the presentation
  of Opcounter Charts. If enabled, each opcounter type is charted
  separately. Otherwise, each opcounter type is overlaid together in a
  single chart.

- **Group Change**: sets which page of the MMS console you will see when
  you select a different group. You can choose to be directed to the
  "Hosts" page, the "Dashboard" page, or you can select "Current" to
  remain on the the page that you were viewing when you selected a
  different group.

- **Display Chart Annotations**: toggles the display of chart
  annotations. Chart annotations are information about significant
  events, such as when a mongo instance was restarted, that is
  overlaid on the charts.

- **User Time Zone**: sets your local time zone.

- **Log Data Collection For All Hosts**: activates or deactivates
  the collection of log data for all hosts. This will overwrite the
  statuses set on the individual hosts. Log data is displayed
  in the "Logs" tab of the "Host Statistics" page.

- **User Language**: allows you to select the language the MMS Console 
  will display in.

- **User Date Format**: allows you to select your preferred
  date format.

- **Group Time Zone**: sets your group's time zone. 

MMS Agent

MMS Agent provides links for downloading the pre-configured
MMS agent in both .zip and tar.gz formats. It also provides links
to download the unconfigured agent for :ref:`automated agent 
installation <automated-agent-installation>`.

Backup Agent

Backup Agent provides links for downloading the pre-configured Backup
agent in both .zip and tar.gz formats, on a variety of platforms. This

Preferred Hostnames

Preferred Hostnames allows you to specify which hostname to use
for servers with multiple aliases. This prevents servers from
appearing multiple times under different names.

For more information, see ":ref:`How does MMS gather database
statistics? <db-stats-warning>`".

Exposed DB Host Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Exposed DB Host Check is enabled, 10gen will periodically try
to connect to your Mongo instance. If your configuration is secure, this
should fail. If the attempt is successful, we will send you an alert.

Duplicate Hostnames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Duplicate Hostnames enables you to reset/remove all detected
duplicates. This is useful if your server environment has drastically
changed and you believe a host is incorrectly marked as a duplicate.

10gen's e-mail newsletters about MMS.

Backup and Restore Public Key

Backup and Restore Private Key enables users who have signed up for the
`MongoDB Backup and Restore Service
<http://www.10gen.com/products/mongodb-backup-service>`_ to generate a
new public key that 10gen will use to connect via SSH and transmit
a snapshot of your data.

Two-Factor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two-Factor Authentication is only used with `MongoDB Backup and Restore Service
<http://www.10gen.com/products/mongodb-backup-service>`_. Two-Factor
Authentication enables you to configure the service to require two-factor
authentication. To enable two-factor authentication, click on "Set", and
then input your mobile phone number. You will receive an SMS text
message with an authentication code that you will be prompted to input
to complete the setup.
