Overview
--------

Read this guide to learn how to perform **transactions** in MongoDB using the
Node.js driver. A transaction is a unit of work, composed of a series of
operations that you want either to succeed together, or fail together when one
or more of the operations fail. This behavior is called **atomicity**.
Atomicity is a property in which transactions composed of one or more
operations occur all at once, such that no other client can observe them as
separate operations, and that it leaves no changes if one of the operations
fails.

Since all write operations on a single document in MongoDB are atomic, you
may benefit most from transactions when you must make an atomic change that
modifies multiple documents, which is called a multi-document transaction.
Similar to write operations on a single document, multi-document transactions
are **ACID compliant**, which means MongoDB guarantees the data involved
in your transaction operations remains consistent, even if it encounters
unexpected errors. Learn more from this MongoDB article on
`ACID transactions <https://www.mongodb.com/basics/acid-transactions>`__.

You can use the driver to perform multi-document transactions.

.. note::

   To run multi-document transactions, you must use MongoDB version 4.0 or
   later.

   For a detailed list of limitations, see the :manual:`Transactions and
   Operations </core/transactions/#transactions-and-operations>` section in
   the server manual.

In MongoDB, multi-document transactions run within a **client session**.
A client session is a grouping of related read or write operations that
you want to ensure run sequentially. When combined with majority read and
write concerns, the driver can guarantee causal consistency between the
operations. See the server manual guide on
:manual:`Client Sessions and Causal Consistency Guarantees </core/read-isolation-consistency-recency/#std-label-sessions>`
for more information.

Learn more about how to use the driver to run multi-document transactions on
MongoDB in the following sections of this guide:

- :ref:`Transaction Settings <nodejs-transaction-settings>`
- :ref:`Core API Examples <nodejs-transaction-examples>`

.. _nodejs-transaction-apis:

Transaction APIs
----------------

To implement a transaction with the driver, you can use either the
**Core API** or the **Callback API**. To use the Core API, you declare the
start and commit points of the transaction. To use the Callback API, you pass
a callback function that contains the logic you want to run as a transaction.

Core API
~~~~~~~~

The Core API features methods to start, cancel, or commit a transaction.
When you commit the transaction, you send a request to the server to make the
changes from your operations atomically. When using this API, you must handle
certain transaction errors returned by the server manually.

See
:manual:`TransientTransactionError </core/transactions-in-applications/#std-label-transient-transaction-error>`
and
:manual:`UnknownTransactionCommitResult </core/transactions-in-applications/#-unknowntransactioncommitresult->`
for more information on these errors.

To start, cancel, or commit your transaction, you can call the corresponding
method on the ``Session`` object:

- ``startTransaction()``
- ``commitTransaction()``
- ``abortTransaction()``

See the :ref:`Core API example <nodejs-transaction-core-api-example>` for
a sample transaction implementation.

Callback API
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   The Callback API is deprecated in {+driver-short+} version 4.10 and will
   be removed in a future release. We recommend that you use the
   :ref:`Core API <nodejs-transaction-core-api-example>`.

The Callback API enables you to run a transaction by passing a callback
function that encapsulates the series of operations that make up the
transaction. This API automatically handles certain transaction errors
returned by the server.

See
:manual:`TransientTransactionError </core/transactions-in-applications/#std-label-transient-transaction-error>`
and
:manual:`UnknownTransactionCommitResult </core/transactions-in-applications/#-unknowntransactioncommitresult->`
for more information on these errors.

To create a transaction, pass a callback function that encapsulates your
transaction logic to the ``withTransaction()`` method on a ``Session``
object. The driver automatically retries the transaction when it encounters
certain errors reported by the server.

See the :ref:`Callback API example <nodejs-transaction-callback-api-example>`
for a sample transaction implementation.

.. _nodejs-transaction-settings:

Transaction Settings
--------------------

When you instantiate a transaction, you can specify the following options to
set the default behavior for that transaction:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description

   * - ``readConcern``
     - Specifies how to check for the consistency of the data that the
       read operations retrieve from replica sets.

       See :manual:`Read Concern </reference/read-concern/>` in the server
       manual for more information.

   * - ``writeConcern``
     - Specifies conditions in which to acknowledge the write.
       See :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>` in the
       server manual for more information.

   * - ``readPreference``
     - See :manual:`Read Preference </core/read-preference/#read-preference>`
       in the server manual for more information.

   * - ``maxCommitTimeMS``
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time to allow a commit action on a
       transaction to run in milliseconds.

If you do not provide values, the driver uses the client settings.

You can specify the transaction options in the Core API using code that
resembles the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const transactionOptions = {
     readPreference: 'primary',
     readConcern: { level: 'local' },
     writeConcern: { w: 'majority' },
     maxCommitTimeMS: 1000
   };
   session.startTransaction(transactionOptions);

You can specify the transaction options in the Callback API using code that
resembles the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const transactionOptions = {
     readPreference: 'primary',
     readConcern: { level: 'local' },
     writeConcern: { w: 'majority' },
     maxCommitTimeMS: 1000
   };
   await session.withTransaction(
     async (session) => { /* your transaction here */ },
     transactionOptions);

.. _nodejs-transaction-examples:

Examples
--------

Consider a scenario in which a customer purchases items from your online
store. To record the purchase, your application needs to update
information related to inventory, the customer's orders, and register the
order details. Suppose you organize the data updates as follows:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Collection
     - Operation
     - Description of the Change

   * - ``orders``
     - insert
     - Record the purchase information

   * - ``customers``
     - update
     - Append the order id to associate it with the customer

   * - ``inventory``
     - update
     - Subtract quantity of ordered items

A purchase can fail several ways such as if there's insufficient quantity of
the item in inventory, if the order couldn't be completed, or if your
payment system is offline.

If the payment fails, you can use a transaction to make sure that you
avoid exposing any partial updates that might cause data consistency issues
for other operations that depend on that data.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The code examples require the following sample data in the ``testdb``
database to run the multi-document payment transaction:

- A document in the ``customers`` collection that describes a customer and
  their orders.
- Documents in the ``inventory`` collection that each track quantity and
  description of an item.

The document in the ``customers`` collection in this example contains the
following:

.. code-block:: json

   { _id: 98765, orders: [] }

The documents in the ``inventory`` collection in this example contain the
following:

.. code-block:: json

   [
    { name: "sunblock", sku: 5432, qty: 85 },
    { name: "beach towel", sku: 7865, qty: 41 }
   ]

The code examples also perform operations on the ``orders`` collection, but
do not require any prior sample documents.

The code examples use the ``cart`` and ``payment`` variables to represent
a sample list of items purchased and the order payment details as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const cart = [
     { name: 'sunblock', sku: 5432, qty: 1, price: 5.19 },
     { name: 'beach towel', sku: 7865, qty: 2, price: 15.99 }
   ];
   const payment = { customer: 98765, total: 37.17 };

.. important::

   The examples in the following sections require that you create the
   collections outside of the transaction or that you are using MongoDB 4.4 or
   later. For more information on creating collections inside a transaction,
   see the
   :manual:`Create Collections and Indexes in a Transaction </core/transactions/#std-label-transactions-create-collections-indexes>`
   server guide.

.. _nodejs-transaction-core-api-example:

Core API Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code example in this section demonstrates how you can use the Core API to
run the multi-document payment transaction in a session. This function
shows how you can perform the following:

1. Start a session
#. Start a transaction, specifying transaction options
#. Perform data operations in the same session
#. Commit a transaction, or cancel it if the driver encounters an error
#. End a session

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/transactions/txn-core.js
   :language: javascript
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 2-6,8,10,19,32,41,49,51,55-59,63,65
   :start-after: start placeOrder
   :end-before: end placeOrder

Note that you must pass the session object to each CRUD operation that
you want to run on that session.

The code and comments in the ``catch`` block demonstrate how you can identify
the server transaction errors and where you can place your logic to handle
them. Make sure to include the ``MongoError`` type from the driver in your
code as shown in the following sample import statement:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const { MongoError, MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

See the :ref:`Payment Transaction Result <nodejs-transaction-example-payment-result>`
section to see what your collections should contain after you run the
transaction.

.. _nodejs-transaction-callback-api-example:

Callback API Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   The Callback API is deprecated in {+driver-short+} version 4.10 and will
   be removed in a future release. We recommend that you use the
   :ref:`Core API <nodejs-transaction-core-api-example>`.

The code examples in this section show how you can use the Callback API to
run the multi-document payment transaction in a session.

The following code example shows how you can start the session and pass an
anonymous callback function that contains the operations you want to run
as a transaction.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/transactions/txn-callback.js
   :language: javascript
   :linenos:
   :dedent:
   :emphasize-lines: 1-6,8,10-12,16
   :start-after: start session
   :end-before: end session

Rather than pass an anonymous callback function, you can pass a named
function that returns a Promise. See the following ``placeOrder()``
example callback function that you can pass to ``withTransaction()`` to run
as a transaction:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/transactions/txn-callback.js
   :language: javascript
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 9,22,33,41
   :start-after: start callback
   :end-before: end callback

See the :ref:`Payment Transaction Result <nodejs-transaction-example-payment-result>`
section to see what your collections should contain after you run the
transaction.

.. _nodejs-transaction-example-payment-result:

Payment Transaction Result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your application completes the payment transaction, your
database should contain all the updates, and if an exception interrupted your
transaction, none of the changes should exist in your database.

The ``customers`` collection should contain the customer document with an
order id appended to the orders field:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     "_id": 98765,
     "orders": [
       "61dc..."
     ]
   }

The ``inventory`` collection should contain updated quantities for the
items "sunblock" and "beach towel":

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   [
     {
       "_id": ...,
       "name": "sunblock",
       "sku": 5432,
       "qty": 84
     },
     {
       "_id": ...,
       "name": "beach towel",
       "sku": 7865,
       "qty": 39
     }
   ]

The ``orders`` collection should contain the order and payment
information:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   [
     {
       "_id": "...",
       "customer": 98765,
       "items": [
         {
           "name": "sunblock",
           "sku": 5432,
           "qty": 1,
           "price": 5.19
         },
         {
           "name": "beach towel",
           "sku": 7865,
           "qty": 2,
           "price": 15.99
         }
       ],
       "total": 37.17
     }
   ]
