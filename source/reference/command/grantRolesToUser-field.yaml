  The additional roles to grant to the user. You can specify both

  strings. Specify a role as a document if the role exists in another
  database. Specify the role as a string name if it exists in the
  current database. To create a user without roles, specify an empty
  ``roles`` array. For more information on specifying a role, see
  the :data:`~admin.system.users.roles` array.
