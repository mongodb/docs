title: Extract the files from the downloaded archive.

pre: |

   Using an archive manager program or the ``tar`` command, extract the
   files.

   For example, to extract from the terminal shell, you can use the
   following ``tar`` command:
      
   .. tip::

      If you downloaded a different MongoDB {+version+} point release,
      be sure to modify the command to reflect the correct ``.tgz``
      file name.

   .. code-block:: sh

      tar -zxvf mongodb-linux-*-{+release+}.tgz

title: Optional. Ensure the binaries are in a directory listed in your ``PATH`` environment variable.

   The MongoDB binaries are in the ``<mongodb-install-directory>/bin/``
   directory. To avoid having to specify the path to the MongoDB
   binaries, you can modify your user's ``PATH`` environment variable
   to include this directory. For example, you can add the following
   line to your shell's initialization script (e.g. {{bashrc}}):

   .. code-block:: none

      export PATH=<mongodb-install-directory>/bin:$PATH

   Replace ``<mongodb-install-directory>`` with the path to the
   extracted MongoDB archive.

   Alternatively, you can:

   - Copy these binaries into a directory listed in your ``PATH``
     variable such as ``/usr/local/bin``, or

   - Create symbolic links to each of these binaries from a directory
     listed in your ``PATH`` variable.

replacement:
  bashrc: "``~/.bashrc``"
...
