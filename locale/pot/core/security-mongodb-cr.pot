msgid "``MONGODB-CR`` is a challenge-response mechanism that authenticates users through passwords. ``MONGODB-CR`` verifies supplied user credentials against the user's :data:`name <admin.system.users.user>`, :data:`password <admin.system.users.credentials>` and :data:`authentication database <admin.system.users.db>`. The authentication database is the database where the user was created, and the user's database and the user's name together serve to identify the user."

msgid "For drivers that support MongoDB 3.0+ features (see :ref:`compatibility-driver-versions`), you can explicitly specify ``MONGODB-CR`` as the authentication mechanism to use ``MONGODB-CR``. Otherwise, the credentials are temporarily converted to use SCRAM during authentication to provide improved protection from passive eavesdroppers; this temporary conversion does not affect how the credentials are stored."
