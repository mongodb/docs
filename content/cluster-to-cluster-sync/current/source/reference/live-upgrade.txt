Starting in ``mongosync`` 1.7.0, you can live upgrade ``mongosync`` without
restarting data synchronization operations from the beginning.

After the live upgrade, ``mongosync`` continues operations that were in
progress before the upgrade.

To live upgrade ``mongosync``, perform these steps:

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: (Optional) Pause the ``mongosync`` processes

      To pause ``mongosync``, run :ref:`c2c-api-pause` on each running
      ``mongosync`` process.

      You can resume the ``mongosync`` processes later from the paused
      state, as shown in the final step.

      .. tip::

         If you don't want to immediately resume data synchronization
         operations after live upgrade, consider pausing the
         ``mongosync`` processes. This is useful if you're coordinating
         operations from multiple ``mongosync`` processes.

   .. step:: Stop the ``mongosync`` processes

      Use your operating system to stop each running ``mongosync``
      process. To stop a process, see your operating system
      documentation for the specific steps.

   .. step:: Download and install the new ``mongosync`` binaries

      To download and install the new ``mongosync`` binaries, see
      :ref:`download and install mongosync <c2c-install>`.

   .. step:: Initialize the ``mongosync`` processes

      To initialize the ``mongosync`` processes, see 
      :ref:`Quickstart <c2c-quickstart>`. During initialization after a
      live upgrade, ``mongosync`` updates the persistent metadata.

   .. step:: Resume the ``mongosync`` processes

      If you paused any ``mongosync`` processes earlier in the optional
      first step, run :ref:`c2c-api-resume` on all ``mongosync``
      processes.

If a data synchronization operation was already in progress before the
live upgrade, new features added in the latest ``mongosync`` version may
not all be supported after the live upgrade. Performance improvements
and bug fixes are always supported after the live upgrade. For more
information on the new features that might be supported after a live
upgrade, see the :ref:`1.7.0-c2c-release-notes`.
