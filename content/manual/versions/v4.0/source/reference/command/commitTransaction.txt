.. dbcommand:: commitTransaction

   .. versionadded:: 4.0

   Saves the changes made by the operations in the :doc:`multi-document
   transaction </core/transactions>` and ends the transaction. Until
   the commit, none of the data changes made from within the
   transaction are visible outside the transaction.

   To run the :dbcommand:`commitTransaction`, the command must be run
   against the ``admin`` database and run within a
   :method:`Session`. Rather than run the :dbcommand:`commitTransaction`
   command directly, most users should use the driver method or the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell :method:`Session.commitTransaction()`
   helper.

   The command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        commitTransaction: 1, 
        txnNumber: <long>,
        writeConcern: <document>,
        autocommit: false
       }

Behavior
--------

Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When committing the transaction, the session uses the write concern
specified at the transaction start. See
:method:`Session.startTransaction()`.

If you commit using :writeconcern:`"w: 1" <\<number\>>` write concern,
your transaction can be :doc:`rolled back if there is a failover.
</core/replica-set-rollbacks>`.

Atomicity
~~~~~~~~~

When a transaction commits, all data changes made in the transaction
are saved and visible outside the transaction.
