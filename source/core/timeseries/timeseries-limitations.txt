Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~

The maximum size of a measurement document is 4 MB.

.. _timeseries-limitations-updates-deletes:

Updates and Deletes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, you can perform some delete and update
operations.

Delete commands must meet the following requirements:

- The query may only match on ``metaField`` field values.
- The delete command may not limit the number of documents to be
  deleted. You must use a delete command with ``justOne: false`` or the
  :method:`~db.collection.deleteMany()` method.

Update commands must meet the following requirements:

- The query may only match on ``metaField`` field values.
- The update command may only modify the ``metaField`` field value.
- The update must be performed with an update document that contains
  only :ref:`update operator <update-operators>` expressions.
- The update command may not limit the number of documents to be
  updated. You must use an update command with ``multi: true`` or the
  :method:`~db.collection.updateMany()` method.
- The update command may not set :ref:`upsert: true <update-upsert>`.

In MongoDB 5.0, :ref:`Time series collections
<manual-timeseries-collection>` only support insert operations and read
queries. Updates and manual delete operations result in an error.

To automatically delete old data, :ref:`set up automatic removal (TTL)
<set-up-automatic-removal>`.

To remove all documents from a collection, use the
:method:`~db.collection.drop()` method to drop the collection.

.. _timeseries-limitations-secondary-indexes:

Secondary Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add :term:`secondary indexes <secondary index>` on the fields
specified as the ``timeField`` and the ``metaField``. If the field value
for the ``metaField`` field is a document, you can also create secondary
indexes on fields inside that document.

In MongoDB 5.1, the ``metaField`` doesn't support :doc:`text
</core/index-text>` indexes.

In MongoDB 5.0, the ``metaField`` doesn't support the following index
types:

- :doc:`2d </core/2d>`
- :doc:`2dsphere </core/2dsphere>`
- :doc:`text </core/index-text>`

Secondary indexes don't support the following index properties:

- :doc:`TTL </core/index-ttl>`
- :doc:`Unique </core/index-unique>`
- :doc:`Partial </core/index-partial>`

``reIndex``
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :dbcommand:`reIndex` command is not supported for :ref:`time series
collections <manual-timeseries-collection>`.

Capped Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A time series collection can't be created as a :ref:`capped collection
<manual-capped-collection>`.

Modification of Collection Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection's type can only be set when creating the collection:

- An existing collection can't be converted into a :ref:`time series
  collection <manual-capped-collection>`.
- A :ref:`time series collection <manual-capped-collection>` can't be
  converted into a different collection type.

To move data from an existing collection to a time series collection,
:ref:`migrate data into a time series collection
<migrate-data-into-a-timeseries-collection>`.

Modification of ``timeField`` and ``metaField``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only set a collection's ``timeField`` and ``metaField``
parameters when creating the collection. After creation these parameters
can't be modified.

.. _timeseries-limitations-granularity:

Modification of ``granularity``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the ``granularity`` is set it can only be increased by one level at
a time. From ``"seconds"`` to ``"minutes"`` or from ``"minutes"`` to
``"hours"``. Other changes are not allowed. If you need to change the
``granularity`` from ``"seconds"`` to ``"hours"``, first increase the
``granularity`` to ``"minutes"`` and then to ``"hours"``.

Schema Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot specify :doc:`validation rules </core/schema-validation>` for
:ref:`time series collections <manual-timeseries-collection>`.

Client-Side Field Level Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Client-side field level encryption
</core/security-client-side-encryption>` is not supported for
:ref:`time series collections <manual-timeseries-collection>`.

.. _time-series-limitations-sharding:

Sharding
~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, sharded time series collections are supported.
When using sharded time series collections, you cannot:

- Modify the ``granularity`` of a sharded time series
  collection.

- Run sharding administration commands, including:

  - :dbcommand:`moveChunk`
  - :dbcommand:`splitChunk`

Aggregation $out and $merge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aggregation pipeline stages :pipeline:`$out` and :pipeline:`$merge`
can't output to :ref:`time series collections
<manual-timeseries-collection>`.

Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can't write to :ref:`time series collections
<manual-timeseries-collection>` in :doc:`transactions
</core/transactions>`.

.. note::

  Reads from time series collections are supported in transactions.

Change Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:doc:`Change streams </changeStreams>` are not supported for
:ref:`time series collections <manual-timeseries-collection>`.

Database Triggers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:realm:`Database Triggers </triggers/database-triggers>` are not
supported for :ref:`time series collections
<manual-timeseries-collection>`.

GraphQL API
~~~~~~~~~~~

:realm:`GraphQL API </graphql>` is not supported for :ref:`time series
collections <manual-timeseries-collection>`.

Atlas Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>` is not supported for :ref:`time
series collections <manual-timeseries-collection>`.

Realm Sync
~~~~~~~~~~

:realm:`Realm Sync </sync>` is not supported for :ref:`time series
collections <manual-timeseries-collection>`.
