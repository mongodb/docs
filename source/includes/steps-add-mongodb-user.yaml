  Together, the database and username uniquely identify the user. Though
  the user has just one authentication database, the user can have
  privileges on other database. You grant privileges when assigning the
  user roles.

  You can add users to the ``$external`` database, much as you would to
  any other database. The ``$external`` database allows MongoDB
  instances to consult an external source, such as Kerberos or an LDAP
  server, to authenticate. As such, you do not need to specify a
  password for the users that you add to ``$external``.
