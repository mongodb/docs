  a. Click :guilabel:`Azure Key Vault` if the :guilabel:`Azure Key Vault` 
     selector is not already active.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Encryption Key` if the :guilabel:`Encryption Key` 
     selector is not already active.
    

  #. Enter the Azure Key Identifier in the :guilabel:`Key Identifier` 
     field.

     Include the full |url| to the new encryption key identifier. For 
     example:

     .. code-block:: http

        https://mykeyvault.vault.azure.net/keys/AtlasKMSKey/a241124e3d364e9eb99fbd3e11124b23

     .. important::

        The encryption key **must** belong to the Key Vault configured 
        for the project. Click the :guilabel:`Key Vault` section to view 
        the currently configured Key Vault for the project.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Update Credentials`.

  |service| displays a banner in the |service| UI during the 
  Key Identifier rotation process. Do **not**
  delete or disable the original Key Identifier until your
  changes have deployed.

  If the cluster uses :ref:`backup-cloud-provider`, do **not** delete
  or disable the original Key Identifier until you
  validate that no snapshots used that key for encryption.
