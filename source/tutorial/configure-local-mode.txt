In a default configuration, the {+mdbagent+}s and Backup Daemons
access MongoDB binaries over the internet from |company|

If your environment prevents granting all hosts in your MongoDB
deployment access to the internet, you have two options:

Only Ops Manager Has Internet Access
   Configure |onprem| to download installers from the internet. Backup
   Daemons and managed MongoDB hosts can then download installers from
   |onprem|.

No Hosts Have Internet Access
   Configure Backup Daemons and managed MongoDB hosts to download
   installers only from |onprem|. The installers need to uploaded to
   |onprem| separately.

        To manage MongoDB hosts without internet access, you must
        specify that:

        - :guilabel:`Agents get the installers from:` the
          :guilabel:`Ops Manager Application Server`, and

        - :guilabel:`Ops Manager gets installers from:` a
          :guilabel:`Direct connection to MongoDB`.

        |onprem| hosts download
        MongoDB installer binaries from the internet. MongoDB hosts
        with {+mdbagent+}s download these installers from the
        |onprem| hosts and then install or upgrade MongoDB deployments.

        The following tutorial outlines the steps to run |onprem| with
        internet access when MongoDB hosts do not.

        To manage MongoDB hosts and run |onprem| without internet
        access, you must specify that:

        - :guilabel:`Agents get the installers from:`
          :guilabel:`Ops Manager Application Server`, and

        - :guilabel:`Ops Manager gets installers from:`
          :guilabel:`Ops Manager Application Server Hard Drive`.

        For Backup Daemons or {+mdbagent+}s to install or
        upgrade MongoDB deployments, you must:

        - Download the MongoDB installer binaries for each edition,
          version, and platform you need to support from another
          internet-connected device.
        - Load the MongoDB installer binaries to each |onprem| host.
        - Update the :term:`version manifest`.

        The following tutorial outlines the steps to run |onprem|
        without internet access.

Considerations
--------------

MongoDB Community for Windows with |tls| Incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|onprem| supports MongoDB Community Edition for Microsoft Windows with
|tls| in the following versions:

- MongoDB versions 3.2.12 or later
- MongoDB versions 3.4.1 or later
- MongoDB release series 3.6 and 4.0

To use earlier versions, you must download them from the
:dl:`MongoDB Download Center <community>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Install MongoDB Enterprise Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you plan on running
:product:`MongoDB Enterprise <mongodb-enterprise-advanced>` on Linux
hosts, then you must manually install a set of dependencies to each
host *before installing MongoDB*. The MongoDB manual provides the
appropriate command to install the dependencies. Refer to the
instructions for the appropriate host platform:

        Required User Role to Change Mode
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        To configure internet access for |onprem| and {+mdbagent+}s,
        you must have :ref:`Global Owner <global-owner-role>` access to
        |onprem|.

        Required User Role to Change Mode
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        To configure internet access for |onprem| and {+mdbagent+}s,
        you must have :ref:`Global Owner <global-owner-role>` access to
        |onprem|.

        .. _local-mode-determine-versions:

        Determine which Binaries to Store Locally and Download
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        MongoDB Community and Enterprise installation binaries are
        available for all
        :ref:`supported platforms <ops-manager-operating-system>` and
        MongoDB versions.

        Download binaries associated to each combination
        of MongoDB version, platform, and edition that you
        want to support in your current and prospective
        |onprem|\-managed deployments, including one for:

        - Each platform and version that your current and planned
          MongoDB deployments run.

        - Each platform and version along the
          :doc:`upgrade path </tutorial/upgrade-ops-manager>` of
          any existing MongoDB deployments you want to upgrade.

          .. example::

             If you import an existing deployment of MongoDB 3.4
             Community on Ubuntu 14.04 and want to upgrade it to
             MongoDB 4.0 Enterprise on Ubuntu 14.04, you must
             download and store all archived binaries for:

             - MongoDB 3.4 Community Edition
             - MongoDB 3.6 Community Edition
             - MongoDB 4.0 Community Edition
             - MongoDB 4.0 Enterprise Edition

        - If you are running backups, you need the MongoDB binary for
          the platform on which the |onprem| :term:`Backup Daemon`
          runs.

          .. example::

             If you are running a MongoDB replica set on MongoDB 3.6.8
             on a set of Ubuntu hosts and running |onprem| on Windows,
             you must have archived binaries of MongoDB 3.6.8 for
             Ubuntu and for Windows.

        - If you are running
          :doc:`queryable backups </tutorial/query-backup>`,
          you need the Enterprise edition of the MongoDB version that
          your deployment runs.

          .. example::

             If you are running a MongoDB replica set on MongoDB 3.6.8
             on a set of Ubuntu hosts and want to query backups from
             an |onprem| install on Windows, you must have archived
             binaries of MongoDB Community 3.6.8 for Ubuntu and
             MongoDB Enterprise 3.6.8 Windows.
