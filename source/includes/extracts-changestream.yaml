   Unlike the MongoDB :ecosystem:`drivers </drivers>`, the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell does not automatically attempt to resume a
   change stream cursor after an error. The MongoDB drivers make *one*
   attempt to automatically resume a change stream cursor after certain
   errors.


   |watchmethod| uses information stored in the oplog to produce the
   change event description and generate a resume token associated to
   that operation. If the operation identified by the resume token
   passed to the ``resumeAfter`` or ``startAfter`` option has already
   dropped off the :term:`oplog`, |watchmethod| cannot resume the
   change stream.

   See :ref:`change-stream-resume` for more information on
   resuming a change stream.

ref: changestream-full-document-lookup
content: |
   By default, the :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` returns
   specific field changes/deltas for update operations. You can also
   configure the change stream to look up and return the current
   majority-committed version of the changed document. Depending on other
   write operations that may have occurred between the update and the
   lookup, the returned document may differ significantly from the
   document at the time of the update.

   Depending on the number of changes applied during the update operation
   and the size of the full document, there is a risk that the size of the
   change event document for an update operation is greater than the 16MB
   BSON document limit. If this occurs, the server closes the change stream
   cursor and returns an error.

ref: changestream-remove-shard

   If the deployment is a sharded cluster, a shard removal may cause an
   open change stream cursor to close, and the closed change stream cursor may
   not be fully resumable.

   A shard removal may cause an open :doc:`change stream cursor
   </changeStreams>` to close, and the closed change stream cursor may
   not fully resumable.

ref: changestream-invalid-events
content: |

  You cannot use ``resumeAfter`` to resume a change stream after an
  :ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>` (for example, a collection
  drop or rename) closes the stream. Starting in MongoDB 4.2, you can use
  :ref:`startAfter <change-stream-start-after>` to start a new change
  stream after an :ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>`.

---
ref: changestream-cursor-open
content: |

   The :ref:`change stream cursor <changeStreams>` remains open until
   one of the following occurs:

   - The cursor is explicitly closed.

   - An :ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>` occurs; for
     example, a collection drop or rename.

   - The connection to the MongoDB deployment is closed.

ref: changestream-resume-token-change
content: |

   If the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` (fcv) is set to ``"4.0"`` or
   greater, newly opened change streams return a hex-encoded string for
   the resume token data, i.e. the ``_id._data`` value. This change
   allows for the ability to compare and sort the resume tokens. If the
   fcv is ``3.6``, newly opened change streams return a BinData for the
   resume token data.

   .. important::

      The fcv value at the time of the cursor's opening determine the
      resume token data type. That is, the modification of the fcv does
      not affect the resume tokens for change streams already opened
      before the fcv change.
   
   Regardless of the fcv value, a 4.0 replica set or a sharded cluster can
   resume a change stream using either the BinData or string resume token.

   As such, a 4.0 deployment can use a resume token from a change stream
   opened on a collection from a 3.6 deployment.
---
ref: changestream-resume-token-downgrade
content: |

   A 3.6 deployment can use the BinData resume token returned from a
   change stream opened against a collection from a deployment with fcv
   ``3.6``. However, a 3.6 deployment cannot use a string resume token
   returned from a change stream opened against a collection from a
   deployment with fcv ``4.0``.
