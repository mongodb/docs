Definition
~~~~~~~~~~

The :pipeline:`$sessionWindow` stage specifies a session window for aggregation of 
data. Session windows allow you to run a pipeline on each "session" of activity in an 
input stream. Two documents are in the same session if they have the same partition, and 
the difference of their timestamps is less than the session gap. When a window is closed, 
its results are released to the next stage. 

A session window closes when the watermark advances a duration of the ``gap`` value plus the ``allowedLateness``  
value beyond the maximum document timestamp in the session. A closed session window's start time 
is the timestamp of the first event in the session, and the end time is the timestamp 
of the last event in the session, plus the gap. Session window end time adds the gap 
to the maximum timestamp in the session. The window results are the output of 
``$sessionWindow.pipeline`` on the documents that fit in the window.

.. pipeline:: $sessionWindow

   A ``$sessionWindow`` pipeline stage has the following prototype 
   form:

   .. code-block:: json

      { 
        $sessionWindow: {
            partitionBy: "$userId",
            gap: {unit: "minute", size: 5},
            pipeline: [{$match: {ad: true}}, {$group: { _id: null, total: {$sum: "$value"}}}], 
            boundary: "eventTime",
            allowedLateness: {unit: "second", size: 5}
        }
      }

Syntax
~~~~~~

The ``$sessionWindow`` stage takes a document with the following 
fields: 

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 15 15 50

   * - Field 
     - Type 
     - Necessity 
     - Description
   
   * - ``partitionBy``
     - expression
     - Required
     - Fields to partition the ``$sessionWindow``. MongoDB processes 
       incoming documents that share the same ``partitionBy`` fields together.

       ``partitionBy`` only supports single-field or simple expressions. It does not
       support multi-key embedded documents.

   * - ``gap``
     - document
     - Required
     - Document that defines the amount of time as a combination of a ``size`` and a ``unit`` to wait for 
       additional records that share ``partitionBy`` values before closing the session, where:

       - The value of ``size`` must be a non-zero positive integer.
       - The value of ``unit`` must be one of the following:

         - ``"ms"`` (millisecond)
         - ``"second"``
         - ``"minute"``
         - ``"hour"``
         - ``"day"``

       For example, with a ``size`` of "1" and a ``unit`` of "minute",
       this stage waits one minute for additional records with the same
       ``partitionBy`` values before closing the session window.

   * - ``boundary``
     - string
     - Optional
     - String specifying whether window boundaries are determined 
       by event time or processing time. Value can be either ``eventTime`` 
       or ``processingTime``. See :ref:`stream processing timing <atlas-sp-timing>` 
       to learn more. If omitted, this field defaults to ``eventTime``.

       You can't set the ``allowedLateness`` field when 
       ``boundary`` is set to ``processingTime``. 

   * - ``pipeline``
     - array
     - Required
     - Nested aggregation pipeline evaluated against the messages
       within the window.

   * - ``allowedLateness``
     - duration
     - Optional
     - Document that specifies the amount of time as a combination of a ``size`` and a ``unit`` to keep 
       :ref:`windows <atlas-sp-windows>` generated from the source open to accept late-arriving data after processing
       documents for window end time, where:

       - The value of ``size`` must be a non-zero positive integer.
       - The value of ``unit`` must be one of the following:

         - ``"ms"`` (millisecond)
         - ``"second"``
         - ``"minute"``
         - ``"hour"``
         - ``"day"``

       For example, a ``size`` of "3" and a ``unit`` of "second" waits 3 seconds after the gap for 
       late-arriving records before moving records to the next stage.
       
       If omitted, defaults to 3 seconds.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

Each input document that reaches the ``$sessionWindow`` stage is assigned a partition 
from the ``partitionBy`` expression. Each document is assigned to a session window 
based on its partition and timestamp. This might be a new or an existing session window. 
When a window is closed, its results are released to the next stage. The window results 
are the output of the pipeline on the documents in the window. 

A session window is closed when the watermark advances the gap and the ``allowedLateness`` 
values beyond the maximum document timestamp in the session. A closed session window's 
start time is the timestamp of the first event in the session. A closed session window's end 
time is the timestamp of the last event in the session, plus the gap. The session window end 
time adds the gap to the maximum timestamp in the session. 

.. note::
   
   Suppose there is a session window for partition A, with a maximum timestamp of 
   ``2024-01-01 00:40:00``. With a 1 hour gap, if no later documents arrive for partition A, 
   the session window is closed when the watermark reaches ``2024-01-01 01:40:00``.

If the ``partitionBy`` expression fails for an input document, the document is sent to the DLQ. 
When processing out-of-order data, a document can arrive with a timestamp within the gap of 
existing session windows of the same partition. This will merge the session windows. 

If a document arrives at the ``$sessionWindow`` stage with a timestamp that is less than the value 
of the most recent watermark from the source, and there is no open session for that document, the 
document is sent to the DLQ. When a document reaches the ``$sessionWindow`` stage, its stream 
meta ``window.partition``, ``window.start``, and ``window.end`` fields are set.

Events can arrive out of order. Two events that have the same ``partitionBy`` value might arrive, 
and their timestamps might be separated by more than the gap. Initially, these events will be placed 
in separate session windows. Later, another event could arrive that merges the two session windows.
