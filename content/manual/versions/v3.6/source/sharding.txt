:term:`Sharding<sharding>` is a method for distributing data across multiple
machines. MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large data
sets and high throughput operations.

Database systems with large data sets or high throughput applications can
challenge the capacity of a single server. For example, high query rates can
exhaust the CPU capacity of the server. Working set sizes larger than the
system's RAM stress the I/O capacity of disk drives.

There are two methods for addressing system growth: vertical and horizontal
scaling.

*Vertical Scaling* involves increasing the capacity of a single server, such
as using a more powerful CPU, adding more RAM, or increasing the amount of
storage space. Limitations in available technology may restrict a single
machine from being sufficiently powerful for a given workload. Additionally,
Cloud-based providers have hard ceilings based on available hardware
configurations. As a result, there is a practical maximum for vertical scaling.

*Horizontal Scaling* involves dividing the system dataset and load over
multiple servers, adding additional servers to increase capacity as required.
While the overall speed or capacity of a single machine may not be high, each
machine handles a subset of the overall workload, potentially providing better
efficiency than a single high-speed high-capacity server. Expanding the
capacity of the deployment only requires adding additional servers as needed,
which can be a lower overall cost than high-end hardware for a single machine.
The trade off is increased complexity in infrastructure and maintenance for
the deployment.

MongoDB supports *horizontal scaling* through :term:`sharding`.

Sharded Cluster
---------------

A MongoDB :term:`sharded cluster` consists of the following components:

* :doc:`shard </core/sharded-cluster-shards>`: Each shard contains a
  subset of the sharded data. Each shard can be deployed as a :term:`replica
  set`.

* :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-query-router`: The ``mongos`` acts as a
  query router, providing an interface between client applications and the
  sharded cluster.

* :doc:`config servers </core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>`: Config
  servers store metadata and configuration settings for the cluster. As
  of MongoDB 3.4, config servers must be deployed as a replica set (CSRS).

The following graphic describes the interaction of components within a
sharded cluster:

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-production-architecture.rst

MongoDB shards data at the :term:`collection` level, distributing the
collection data across the shards in the cluster.

Shard Keys
----------

To distribute the documents in a collection, MongoDB :term:`partitions <data
partition>` the collection using the :term:`shard key`. The :term:`shard key`
consists of an immutable field or fields that exist in every document in the
target collection.

You choose the shard key when sharding a collection. The choice of shard key
cannot be changed after sharding. A sharded collection can have only *one*
shard key. See :ref:`sharding-shard-key-creation`.

To shard a non-empty collection, the collection must have an :term:`index`
that starts with the shard key. For empty collections, MongoDB creates the
index if the collection does not already have an appropriate index for the
specified shard key. See :ref:`sharding-shard-key-indexes`.

The choice of shard key affects the performance, efficiency, and scalability
of a sharded cluster. A cluster with the best possible hardware and
infrastructure can be bottlenecked by the choice of shard key. The choice of
shard key and its backing index can also affect the :ref:`sharding strategy
<sharding-strategy>` that your cluster can use.

See the :doc:`shard key</core/sharding-shard-key>`
documentation for more information.

Chunks
------

MongoDB partitions sharded data into :term:`chunks<chunk>`. Each
chunk has an inclusive lower and exclusive upper range based on the
:term:`shard key`.

MongoDB migrates :term:`chunks<chunk>` across the :term:`shards<shard>` in the
:term:`sharded cluster` using the :doc:`sharded cluster balancer
</core/sharding-balancer-administration>`. The balancer attempts to achieve an
even balance of chunks across all shards in the cluster.

See :doc:`/core/sharding-data-partitioning` for more information.

Advantages of Sharding
----------------------

.. _sharding-shard-key-write-scaling:

Reads / Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB distributes the read and write workload across the
:term:`shards <shard>` in the :term:`sharded cluster`, allowing each shard to
process a subset of cluster operations. Both read and write workloads can be
scaled horizontally across the cluster by adding more shards.

For queries that include the shard key or the prefix of a :term:`compound
<compound index>` shard key, :binary:`~bin.mongos` can target the query at a
specific shard or set of shards. These :ref:`targeted
operations<sharding-mongos-targeted>` are generally more efficient than
:ref:`broadcasting <sharding-mongos-broadcast>` to every shard in the cluster.

Storage Capacity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Sharding` distributes data across the :term:`shards <shard>` in the
cluster, allowing each shard to contain a subset of the total cluster data. As
the data set grows, additional shards increase the storage capacity of the
cluster.

.. _sharding-availability:

High Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :term:`sharded cluster` can continue to perform partial read / write
operations even if one or more shards are unavailable. While the subset of
data on the unavailable shards cannot be accessed during the downtime, reads
or writes directed at the available shards can still succeed.

Starting in MongoDB 3.2, you can deploy :term:`config servers <config
server>` as :term:`replica sets <replica set>`. A sharded cluster with
a Config Server Replica Set (CSRS) can continue to process reads and
writes as long as a majority of the replica set is available. 

In version 3.4, MongoDB :ref:`removes support for SCCC config servers
<3.4-compat-remove-sccc>`.

In production environments, individual shards should be deployed as
:term:`replica sets <replica set>`, providing increased redundancy and
availability.

Considerations Before Sharding
------------------------------

Sharded cluster infrastructure requirements and complexity require
careful planning, execution, and maintenance. 

Careful consideration in choosing the shard key is necessary for
ensuring cluster performance and efficiency. You cannot change the
shard key after sharding, nor can you unshard a sharded collection. See
:ref:`sharding-internals-operations-and-reliability`.

Sharding has certain :ref:`operational requirements and
restrictions <sharding-operational-restrictions>`. See
:doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-requirements` for more information.

If queries do *not* include the shard key or the prefix of a
:term:`compound <compound index>` shard key, :binary:`~bin.mongos` performs
a :ref:`broadcast operation <sharding-mongos-broadcast>`, querying
*all* shards in the sharded cluster. These scatter/gather queries can
be long running operations.

.. note::

   If you have an active support contract with MongoDB, consider contacting
   your account representative for assistance with sharded cluster
   planning and deployment.

.. _sharded-vs-non-sharded-collections:

Sharded and Non-Sharded Collections
-----------------------------------

A database can have a mixture of sharded and unsharded collections. Sharded
collections are :term:`partitioned<data partition>` and distributed across the
:term:`shards<shard>` in the cluster. Unsharded collections are stored on a
:term:`primary shard`. Each database has its own primary shard.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-primary-shard.rst

Connecting to a Sharded Cluster
-------------------------------

You must connect to a :term:`mongos` router to interact with any collection in
the :term:`sharded cluster`. This includes sharded *and* unsharded
collections. Clients should *never* connect to a single shard in order to
perform read or write operations.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-mixed.rst

You can connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` the same way you connect to a
:binary:`~bin.mongod`, such as via the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell or a MongoDB
:ecosystem:`driver </drivers?jump=docs>`.

.. _sharding-strategy:

Sharding Strategy
-----------------

MongoDB supports two sharding strategies for distributing data
across :term:`sharded clusters<sharded cluster>`.

Hashed Sharding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hashed Sharding involves computing a hash of the shard key field's
value. Each :term:`chunk` is then assigned a range based on the
hashed shard key values.

.. include:: /includes/tip-applications-do-not-need-to-compute-hashes.rst

.. include:: /images/sharding-hash-based.rst

While a range of shard keys may be "close", their hashed values are unlikely
to be on the same :term:`chunk`. Data distribution based on hashed values
facilitates more even data distribution, especially in data sets where the
shard key changes :ref:`monotonically<shard-key-monotonic>`.

However, hashed distribution means that range-based queries on the shard key
are less likely to target a single shard, resulting in more cluster wide
:ref:`broadcast operations<sharding-mongos-broadcast>`

See :doc:`/core/hashed-sharding` for more information.

Ranged Sharding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ranged sharding involves dividing data into ranges based on the
shard key values. Each :term:`chunk` is then assigned a range based on the
shard key values.

.. include:: /images/sharding-range-based.rst

A range of shard keys whose values are "close" are more likely to reside on
the same :term:`chunk`. This allows for :ref:`targeted
operations<sharding-mongos-targeted>` as a :binary:`~bin.mongos` can route the
operations to only the shards that contain the required data.

The efficiency of ranged sharding depends on the shard key chosen. Poorly
considered shard keys can result in uneven distribution of data, which can
negate some benefits of sharding or can cause performance bottlenecks. See
:ref:`shard key selection<sharding-ranged-shard-key>` for ranged sharding.

See :doc:`/core/ranged-sharding` for more information.

.. _sharding-zone-sharding:

Zones in Sharded Clusters
-------------------------

.. include:: /includes/intro-zone-sharding.rst

Each zone covers one or more ranges of :term:`shard key` values. Each range a
zone covers is always inclusive of its lower boundary and exclusive of its
upper boundary.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-zones.rst

You must use fields contained in the :term:`shard key` when defining a new
range for a zone to cover. If using a :term:`compound <compound index>` shard
key, the range must include the prefix of the shard key. See :ref:`shard keys
in zones <zone-sharding-shard-key>` for more information.

When choosing a shard key, carefully consider the possibility of using zone
sharding in the future, as you cannot change the shard key after
sharding the collection.

Most commonly, zones serve to improve the locality of data for
sharded clusters that span multiple data centers.

See :ref:`zones <zone-sharding>` for more information.

Collations in Sharding
----------------------

Use the :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command with the ``collation :
{ locale : "simple" }`` option to shard a collection which has a
:doc:`default collation </reference/collation>`. Successful 
sharding requires that:

- The collection must have an index whose prefix is the shard key
- The index must have the collation ``{ locale: "simple" }``

When creating new collections with a collation, ensure these conditions
are met prior to sharding the collection.

.. include:: /includes/note-sharding-collation.rst

See :dbcommand:`shardCollection` for more information about sharding
and collation.
