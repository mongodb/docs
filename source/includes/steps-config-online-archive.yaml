content: |

  a. Specify the collection namespace, which includes the database 
     name, the dot (``.``) separator, and the collection name (that is, 
     ``<database>.<collection>``), in the :guilabel:`Namespace` field. 

     You can't modify the :manual:`namespace 
     </reference/limits/#faq-dev-namespace>` once the online archive is 
     created. 

  #. Specify the criteria for selecting documents to archive under the 
     :guilabel:`Date Match` or :guilabel:`Custom Query` tab. 

     .. list-table:: 
        :widths: 20 80 

        * - :guilabel:`Date Match`
          - To select documents from the collection using a combination 
            of a date field and number of days:
            
            - Specify an already indexed date field from the documents 
              in the collection. To specify a nested field, use the 
              :manual:`dot notation 
              </core/document/#embedded-documents>`. You can't modify 
              the date field once the online archive is created.
            - Specify the number of days to keep the data in the 
              |service| cluster.
            - Choose the date format of the specified date field. 
            
            You can't modify the date field once the online archive is 
            created.

        * - :guilabel:`Custom Query`
          - To select documents from the collection using a custom 
            query, specify the |json| query to run. |service| uses the specified query with the :manual:`db.collection.find(query) 
            </reference/method/db.collection.find/>` command. The empty 
            document (``{}``) to return all documents is not supported.

title: "(Optional) Specify the two most frequently queried fields in 
       your collection to create partitions in your online archive."   
ref: oa-config-additional-fields  
content: |
  Enter up to two most commonly queried fields from the collection in 
  the :guilabel:`Second most commonly queried field` and 
  :guilabel:`Third most commonly queried field` fields respectively. To 
  specify nested fields, use the :manual:`dot notation 
  </core/document/#embedded-documents>`.

  The specified fields are used to partition your archived data. 
  Partitions are similar to folders. The date field is in the first 
  position of the partition by default. You can move another field 
  to the first position of the partition if you frequently query by 
  that field. 

  The order of fields listed in the path is important in the same way 
  as it is in :manual:`Compound Indexes </core/index-compound/>`. 
  Data in the specified path is partitioned first by the value of the 
  first field, and then by the value of the next field, and so on. 
  |service| supports queries on the specified fields using the 
  partitions. 
  
  For example, suppose you are configuring the online archive for the 
  ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database. If your 
  archived field is the ``released`` date field, which you moved to the 
  third position, your first queried field is ``title``, and your 
  second queried field is ``plot``, your partition will look similar to 
  the following: 

  .. code-block:: sh 
     :copyable: false 

     /title/plot/released

  |service| creates partitions first for the ``title`` field, followed 
  by  the ``plot`` field, and then the ``released`` field. |service| 
  uses the partitions for queries on the following fields:

  - the ``title`` field,
  - the ``title`` field and the ``plot`` field,
  - the ``title`` field and the ``plot`` field and the ``released`` 
    field.

  |service| can also use the partitions to support a query on the
  ``title`` and ``released`` fields. However, in this case, |service| 
  would not be as efficient in supporting the query as it would be if 
  the query were on the ``title`` and ``plot`` fields only. Partitions 
  are parsed in order; if a query omits a particular partition, 
  |service| is less efficient in making use of any partitions that 
  follow that. Since a query on ``title`` and ``released`` omits 
  ``plot``, |service| uses the ``title`` partition more efficiently 
  than the ``released`` partition to support this query. 
  
  |service| can't use the partitions to support queries on fields not 
  specified here. Also, |service| can't use the partitions to support 
  queries that include the following fields without the ``title`` field:

  - the ``plot`` field,
  - the ``released`` field, or
  - the ``plot`` and ``released`` fields.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-online-archive-partition-field-length.rst

  - Choose fields that do not contain polymorphic data. |service| 
    determines the data type of a partition field by sampling 10 
    documents from the collection. |service| will not archive a 
    document if the specified field value in a document does not match 
    values in other documents in the same collection. 
  - Choose query fields that do not have a large number of possible 
    values unless you always use those fields in your queries. Query 
    fields, such as ``_id``, with possibly large number of values can 
    cause operations such as ``count`` to open all partitions resulting 
    in high latency.
  - Choose fields that you query frequently and order them from the 
    most frequently queried in the first position to the least queried 
    field in the last position. For example, if you frequently query on 
    the date field, then leave the date field in the first position. 
    But if you frequently query on another field, then that field 
    should be in the first position. 

  |service| supports the following partition attribute types: 

  - ``date`` 
  - ``int``
  - ``long``
  - ``objectId``
  - ``string`` 
  - ``uuid``

    .. note:: 
  
       Partition fields of type `UUID 
       <http://bsonspec.org/spec.html>`__ must be of binary subtype 4. 
       |service| skips partition fields of type UUID with subtype 3. 
  
  To learn more about the supported partition attribute types, see 
  :adl:`Partition Attribute Types 
  </supported-unsupported/supported-partition-attributes>`.

  While partitions improve query performance, queries that don't 
  contain these fields require a full collection scan of all archived 
  documents, which will take longer and increase your costs. To learn 
  more about how partitions improve your query performance in Data 
  Lake, see `Data Structure in S3 <https://docs.mongodb.com/datalake/admin/optimize-query-performance#data-structure-in-s3>`__.

  To determine an approximate number of partitions that can be created 
  for the specified fields, connect to your cluster and run the 
  following query on the collection for which you are configuring the 
  online archive: 

  .. code-block:: json 
     :emphasize-lines: 1, 5-6
     
     db.<COLLECTION_NAME>.aggregate([
       {
         $group: { 
           _id:"uniqueValues", 
           uniqueValues1: {$addToSet:"$<QUERY_FIELD_1>"},
           uniqueValues2: {$addToSet:"$<QUERY_FIELD_2>"}
         }
       },
       { 
         $project: { 
           uniqueValue1Count: {$size:"$uniqueValues1"},
           uniqueValue2Count: {$size:"$uniqueValues2"},
           numberOfPartitions: { 
             $multiply: [ 
               {$size:"$uniqueValues1"}, 
               {$size:"$uniqueValues2"}
             ] 
           }
         }
       }
     ])
  
  Replace: 

  - ``<COLLECTION_NAME>`` with your collection name.
  - ``<QUERY_FIELD_[n]>`` with the name of your query field.

  For example, when using the ``movies`` collection  as the 
  ``<COLLECTION_NAME>``, ``released`` as ``<QUERY_FIELD_1>``, and 
  ``title`` as ``<QUERY_FIELD_2>``, the preceding query returns the 
  following output: 

  .. code-block:: sh 
     :copyable: false 

     { "_id" : "uniqueValues", "uniqueValue1Count" : 9448, "uniqueValue2Count" : 21641, "numberOfPartitions" : 204464168 }

  The total number of partitions is based on how frequently data is 
  archived, especially for date partitions, and the value of the fields 
  in the documents that qualify for archiving.
