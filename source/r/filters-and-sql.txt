Filters
-------

.. note::

   When using filters with DataFrames or the R API, the
   underlying Mongo Connector code constructs an :manual:`aggregation
   pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline/>` to filter the data in
   MongoDB before sending it to Spark.

Use ``filter()`` to read a subset of data from your MongoDB collection.

.. include:: /includes/example-load-dataframe.rst

First, set up a dataframe to connect with your default MongoDB data
source:

.. code-block:: none

   df <- read.df("", source = "com.mongodb.spark.sql.DefaultSource")

.. include:: /includes/data-source.rst

The following operation filters the data and includes records where the
``qty`` field is greater than or equal to ``10``:

.. code-block:: none

   head(filter(df, df$qty >= 10))

The operation prints the following output:

.. code-block:: none

   _id qty   type
   1   2  10 orange
   2   3  15 banana

SQL
---

Before running SQL queries on your dataset, you must register a
temporary view for the dataset.

The following example registers a temporary table called ``temp``,
then uses SQL to query for records in which the ``type`` field
contains the letter ``e``:

.. code-block:: python

   createOrReplaceTempView(df, "temp")
   some_fruit <- sql("SELECT type, qty FROM temp WHERE type LIKE '%e%'")
   head(some_fruit)

In the ``sparkR`` shell, the operation prints the following output:

.. code-block:: none

   type qty
   1  apple   5
   2 orange  10
