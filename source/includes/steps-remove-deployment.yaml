  .. list-table::

     * - :guilabel:`Unmanage this item but continue to monitor`

       - Removes the process from management only. You can no longer
         control the process through |mms|, but |mms| continues to
         display its status and track its metrics.

     * - :guilabel:`Completely remove`

       - Removes the processes from both management and monitoring.
         |mms| no longer displays the process.

         Before you can completely remove a managed deployment, you
         must :ref:`terminate the deployment's backups <terminate-backup>`.
