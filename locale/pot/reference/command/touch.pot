msgid "The :dbcommand:`touch` command loads data from the data storage layer into memory. :dbcommand:`touch` can load the data (i.e. documents) indexes or both documents and indexes. Use this command to ensure that a collection, and/or its indexes, are in memory before another operation. By loading the collection or indexes into memory, :program:`mongod` will ideally be able to perform subsequent operations more efficiently. The :dbcommand:`touch` command has the following prototypical form:"

When :dbcommand:`touch` finishes the secondary will automatically return to ``SECONDARY`` state.  See :data:`~replSetGetStatus.members.state` for more information on replica set member states."
