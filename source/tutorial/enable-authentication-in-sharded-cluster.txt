==========================================
Enable Authentication in a Sharded Cluster
==========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 2.0
   Support for authentication with sharded clusters.

Overview
--------

When authentication is enabled on a sharded cluster every client that
accesses the cluster must provide credentials. This includes MongoDB
instances that access each other within the cluster.

To enable authentication on a sharded cluster, you must enable
authentication individually on each component of the cluster. This means
enabling authentication on each :program:`mongos` and each
:program:`mongod`, including each config server and shard, and each member
of a shard's replica set.

Authentication requires an authentication mechanism and, in most cases, a
:setting:`key file <keyFile>`. The content of the key file must be the
same on all cluster members.
