msgid "Use the :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` administrative command to change the size of a replica set member's oplog. :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` enables you to resize the oplog dynamically without restarting the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process."

msgid "You must run this command against the ``admin`` database."

msgid "The command has the following form:"

#: ../source/reference/command/replSetResizeOplog.txt:49
msgid "Changing the oplog size of a given replica set member with :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` does not change the oplog size of any other member in the replica set. You must run :dbcommand:`replSetResizeOplog` on each replica set member in your cluster to change the oplog size for all members."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/reference/command/replSetResizeOplog.txt:55
msgid "Reducing the oplog size does *not* reclaim that disk space automatically. You must run :dbcommand:`compact` against the ``oplog.rs`` collection in the ``local`` database. ``compact`` blocks all operations on the database it runs against. Running ``compact`` against ``oplog.rs`` therefore prevents oplog synchronization. For a procedure on resizing the oplog and compacting ``oplog.rs``, see :doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size`."
