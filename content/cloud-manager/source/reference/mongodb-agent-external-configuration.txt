   :description: Configure MongoDB Agent to manage config files and passwords securely by storing configurations in memory and using shell command flags for passwords.

To meet advanced auditing or compliance needs, you may need to do one
or both of the following actions:

- Store the |mongod| or |mongos| (collectively, the MongoDB process)
  configuration in memory to avoid writing passwords to disk.
- Remove {+mdbagent+} passwords from the {+mdbagent+} configuration
  file and read the passwords passed in the shell command.

.. _mdbagent-config-inmem:

Store MongoDB Process Configuration Files in Memory
---------------------------------------------------

MongoDB :manual:`configuration files </reference/configuration-options>` 
may contain credentials such as:

- :setting:`net.tls.certificateKeyFilePassword`
- :setting:`net.tls.clusterPassword`
- :setting:`security.kmip.clientCertificatePassword`
- :setting:`security.ldap.bind.queryPassword`

By default, the {+mdbagent+} writes MongoDB process configuration files
to disk. However, you can store the configuration files in memory 
by setting :setting:`enableLocalConfigurationServer` to ``true`` 
in your 
:ref:`{+mdbagent+} configuration file <mongodb-agent-config-file-location>`. 
Changing this setting results in the following actions:

- The {+mdbagent+} caches your MongoDB process configuration in memory.
- The MongoDB configuration file on disk contains only a
  :configexpansion:`directive <__rest>` that points to the full
  configuration file.

When the {+mdbagent+} uses an in-memory MongoDB configuration, the MongoDB 
process requests the full configuration file from its local 
{+mdbagent+}. The Agent requests the configuration file using the |url| 
in the :configexpansion:`__rest` expansion directive.

.. warning::
  
   If you use |onprem| version 4.2 or versions 4.4.0 - 4.4.6, you may encounter
   errors when setting :setting:`enableLocalConfigurationServer` to ``true``. 
   To avoid this, see :ref:`store-conf-in-memory`.

Limits Importing Existing MongoDB Deployments
`````````````````````````````````````````````

You can't :doc:`import </tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes>`
MongoDB processes that store configuration files in memory. When the
{+mdbagent+} stores its configuration in memory, MongoDB
redacts any credentials after it starts. Therefore, MongoDB
can't retrieve the credentials needed to import the process.

.. _mdbagent-config-nopass:

Remove Passwords from the MongoDB Agent Configuration File
----------------------------------------------------------

You can set the {+mdbagent+} to read its passwords as shell command
flags rather than read from its configuration file. To use this
feature, add the following settings to the {+mdbagent+}\'s
configuration file:

- :setting:`mmsApiKeyExec`
