Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to
run a database command. You can use database commands to perform a
variety of administrative and diagnostic tasks, such as fetching server
statistics, initializing a replica set, or running an aggregation pipeline.

.. important:: Prefer Driver Methods to Database Commands

   The driver provides wrapper methods for many database commands.
   If possible, we recommend using these methods instead of executing
   database commands.
   
   To perform administrative tasks, use the :mongosh:`MongoDB Shell </>`
   instead of the {+driver-short+}. The shell provides helper methods
   that might not be available in the driver.
   
   If there are no available helpers in the driver or the shell, you
   can use the ``db.runCommand()`` shell method or the driver's
   ``runCommand()`` method, which is described in this
   guide.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants`` database
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To access this database
from your Scala application, create a ``MongoClient`` that connects to an Atlas cluster
and assign the following value to your ``database`` variable:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/run-command.scala
    :language: scala
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-db
    :end-before: end-db

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

.. _scala-execute-command:

Execute a Command
-----------------

To run a database command, create a ``Document`` object that specifies
the command and pass it as a parameter to the ``runCommand()`` method.
This method returns a ``SingleObservable`` instance, and you can subscribe
to this observable to execute the command and access the command result.

The following example calls the ``runCommand()`` method on a database
to run the ``hello`` command, which returns information about the server:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/run-command.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-hello
   :end-before: end-hello

.. tip::

   To view a full list of database commands and their corresponding
   parameters, see :manual:`Database Commands </reference/command/>` in 
   the {+mdb-server+} manual.

.. _scala-command-read-pref:

Set a Read Preference
----------------------

The ``runCommand()`` method does not inherit the read preference you might
have set on your ``MongoDatabase`` instance. By default, ``runCommand()``
uses the ``primary`` read preference.

You can set a read preference for the command execution by passing a
``ReadPreference`` instance as a parameter to ``runCommand()``, as
shown in the following code:
   
.. literalinclude:: /includes/run-command.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-readpref
   :end-before: end-readpref

.. tip::

   To learn more about read preference options, see :manual:`Read
   Preference </core/read-preference/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

.. _scala-command-response:

Response
--------

The ``runCommand()`` method returns a ``SingleObservable`` that contains
the response from the database for the given command. You can call the
``subscribe()`` method on the observable to run the command and access
the response as a document.

The raw command response document contains the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``<command result>``
     - Fields specific to the database command. For example,
       the ``hello`` command returns the ``topologyVersion`` field.

   * - ``ok``
     - Indicates whether the command has succeeded (``1.0``) or failed (``0.0``). The
       driver raises a ``MongoCommandException`` if the ``ok``
       value is ``0.0``.

   * - ``$clusterTime``
     - A document that contains the signed cluster time. Cluster time is a
       logical time used for the ordering of operations. This field only
       applies to commands run on replica sets or sharded cluster.

   * - ``operationTime``
     - The logical time of the operation execution. This field only
       applies to commands run on replica sets or sharded cluster.

.. tip::

   To learn more about logical time, see the Wikipedia entry on
   the :wikipedia:`logical clock <w/index.php?title=Logical_clock&oldid=1072010149>`.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example runs the ``dbStats`` command to retrieve
storage statistics for the ``sample_restaurants`` database, then prints the
command results:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/run-command.scala
   :language: scala
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start-print-command
   :end-before: end-print-command

The output of this command includes information about the data stored in
the database, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   {"db": "sample_restaurants", "collections": 4, "views": 0, "objects":
   18767, "avgObjSize": 596.1911866574306, "dataSize": 11188720,
   "storageSize": 7528448, "totalFreeStorageSize": 0, "numExtents": 0,
   "indexes": 6, "indexSize": 1519616, "indexFreeStorageSize": 0,
   "fileSize": 0, "nsSizeMB": 0, "ok": 1}
