On Windows Server systems, the ``netsh`` program provides
methods for managing the :guilabel:`Windows Firewall`. These firewall rules make it possible
for administrators to control what hosts can connect to the system,
and limit risk exposure by limiting the hosts that can connect to a
system.

This document outlines basic :guilabel:`Windows Firewall` configurations.
Use these approaches as a starting point for your
larger networking organization.
For a detailed over view of security
practices and risk management for MongoDB, see
:doc:`/security`.

.. seealso:: `Windows Firewall <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/network/bb545423.aspx>`_
   documentation from Microsoft.

Overview
--------

:guilabel:`Windows Firewall` processes rules in an ordered determined
by rule type, and parsed in the following order:

#. ``Windows Service Hardening``
#. ``Connection security rules``
#. ``Authenticated Bypass Rules``
#. ``Block Rules``
#. ``Allow Rules``
#. ``Default Rules``

By default, the policy in :guilabel:`Windows Firewall` allows all outbound connections
and blocks all incoming connections.

Given the :doc:`default ports </reference/default-mongodb-port>` of all
MongoDB processes, you must configure networking rules that permit *only*
required communication between your application and the appropriate
:binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` and :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` instances.

The configuration changes outlined in this document will create rules
which explicitly allow traffic from specific addresses and on specific
ports, using a default policy that drops all traffic that is not
explicitly allowed.

You can configure the :guilabel:`Windows Firewall` with using the ``netsh`` command line
tool or through a windows application.  On Windows Server 2008 this
application is :guilabel:`Windows Firewall With Advanced Security` in :guilabel:`Administrative Tools`.
On previous versions of Windows Server, access the
:guilabel:`Windows Firewall` application in the :guilabel:`System and Security` control panel.

The procedures in this document use the ``netsh`` command line tool.

Patterns
--------

This section contains a number of patterns and examples for
configuring :guilabel:`Windows Firewall` for use with MongoDB deployments.
If you have configured different ports using the :setting:`~net.port` configuration
setting, you will need to modify the rules accordingly.

.. _wfirewall-basic-rule-set:

Traffic to and from ``mongod.exe`` Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This pattern is applicable to all :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` instances running
as standalone instances or as part of a :term:`replica set`.
The goal of this pattern is to explicitly allow traffic to the
:binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` instance from the application server.

.. code-block:: bat

   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open mongod port 27017" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=27017

This rule allows all incoming traffic to port ``27017``, which
allows the application server to connect to the
:binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` instance.

:guilabel:`Windows Firewall` also allows enabling network access for
an entire application rather than to a specific port, as in the
following example:

.. code-block:: bat

   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allowing mongod" dir=in action=allow program=" C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe"

You can allow all access for a :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` server, with the
following invocation:

.. code-block:: bat

   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allowing mongos" dir=in action=allow program=" C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongos.exe"

Traffic to and from ``mongos.exe`` Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` instances provide query routing for
:term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`. Clients connect to :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe`
instances, which behave from the client's perspective as
:binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` instances. In turn, the :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe`
connects to all :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` instances that are components of
the sharded cluster.

Use the same :guilabel:`Windows Firewall` command to allow traffic to
and from these instances as you would from the :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe`
instances that are members of the replica set.

.. code-block:: bat

   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open mongod shard port 27018" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=27018

Traffic to and from a MongoDB Config Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuration servers, host the :term:`config database` that stores metadata
for sharded clusters. Each production cluster has three configuration
servers, initiated using the :option:`mongod --configsvr`
option. [#config-option]_ Configuration servers listen for connections on port
``27019``. As a result, add the following :guilabel:`Windows Firewall` rules to the
config server to allow incoming and outgoing connection on port
``27019``, for connection to the other config servers.

.. code-block:: bat

   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open mongod config svr port 27019" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=27019

Additionally, config servers need to allow incoming connections from
all of the :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` instances in the cluster *and* all
:binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` instances in the cluster. Add rules that
resemble the following:

.. code-block:: bat

   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open mongod config svr inbound" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP remoteip=<ip-address> localport=27019

Replace ``<ip-address>`` with the addresses of the
:binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` instances and the shard :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe`
instances.

.. [#config-option] You also can run a config server by using the
   ``configsvr`` value for the :setting:`~sharding.clusterRole` setting in a
   configuration file.

Traffic to and from a MongoDB Shard Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For shard servers, running as :option:`mongod --shardsvr`
[#shard-option]_ Because the default port number is ``27018`` when running 
with the ``shardsvr`` value for the :setting:`~sharding.clusterRole` setting, 
you must configure the following :guilabel:`Windows Firewall` rules to allow 
traffic to and from each shard:

.. code-block:: bat

   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open mongod shardsvr inbound" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP remoteip=<ip-address> localport=27018
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open mongod shardsvr outbound" dir=out action=allow protocol=TCP remoteip=<ip-address> localport=27018

Replace the ``<ip-address>`` specification with the IP address of all
:binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` instances. This allows you to permit incoming
and outgoing traffic between all shards including constituent replica
set members to:

- all :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` instances in the shard's replica sets.

- all :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` instances in other shards. [#migrations]_

Furthermore, shards need to be able make outgoing connections to:

- all :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` instances.

- all :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` instances in the config servers.

Create a rule that resembles the following, and replace the
``<ip-address>`` with the address of the config servers and the
:binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` instances:

.. code-block:: bat

   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open mongod config svr outbound" dir=out action=allow protocol=TCP remoteip=<ip-address> localport=27018

.. [#shard-option] You can also specify the shard server option with the ``shardsvr`` value
   for the :setting:`~sharding.clusterRole` setting in the configuration file. Shard
   members are also often conventional replica sets using the default
   port.

.. [#migrations] All shards in a cluster need to be able to
   communicate with all other shards to facilitate :term:`chunk` and
   balancing operations.

Provide Access For Monitoring Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :binary:`~bin.mongostat` diagnostic tool, when running with the
:option:`--discover <mongostat --discover>` needs to be able to reach
all components of a cluster, including the config servers, the shard
servers, and the :binary:`~bin.mongos.exe` instances.

Manage and Maintain *Windows Firewall* Configurations
-----------------------------------------------------

This section contains a number of basic operations for managing and
using ``netsh``. While you can use the GUI front ends to manage the
:guilabel:`Windows Firewall`, all core functionality is accessible is
accessible from ``netsh``.

Delete all *Windows Firewall* Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete the firewall rule allowing :binary:`~bin.mongod.exe` traffic:

.. code-block:: bat

   netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Open mongod port 27017" protocol=tcp localport=27017

   netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Open mongod shard port 27018" protocol=tcp localport=27018

List All *Windows Firewall* Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To return a list of all :guilabel:`Windows Firewall` rules:

.. code-block:: bat

   netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all

Reset *Windows Firewall*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To reset the :guilabel:`Windows Firewall` rules:

.. code-block:: bat

   netsh advfirewall reset

Backup and Restore *Windows Firewall* Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To simplify administration of larger collection of systems, you can export or
import firewall systems from different servers) rules very easily on Windows:

Export all firewall rules with the following command:

.. code-block:: bat

   netsh advfirewall export "C:\temp\MongoDBfw.wfw"

Replace ``"C:\temp\MongoDBfw.wfw"`` with a path of your choosing. You
can use a command in the following form to import a file created using
this operation:

.. code-block:: bat

   netsh advfirewall import "C:\temp\MongoDBfw.wfw"
