Hosts
~~~~~

.. This "Hosts" section is referring to what are now called "deployments." This section
   also needs updating per the new UI.

Hosts are not Visible
+++++++++++++++++++++

Problems with the Monitoring Agent detecting hosts can be caused by a few
factors.

**Host not added to |mms|**: In |mms|, select the :guilabel:`Deployment` tab, then
the :guilabel:`Deployment` page, and then click
the :guilabel:`Add Host` button. In the :guilabel:`New Host` window, specify
the host type, internal hostname, and port. If appropriate, add the database
username and password and whether or not |mms| should use SSL to connect with
your Monitoring Agent. Note it is not necessary to restart your Monitoring
Agent when adding (or removing) a host.

**Accidental duplicate mongods** If you add the host after a crash and restart
the Monitoring Agent, you might not see the hostname on the |mms|
:guilabel:`Deployment` page. |mms| detects the host as a duplicate and suppresses its
data. To reset, select the :guilabel:`Administration` tab, then :guilabel:`Group Settings`,
and then the :guilabel:`Reset Duplicates` button.

**Too many Monitoring Agents installed**: Only one Monitoring Agent is needed
to monitor all hosts within a single network. You can use a single Monitoring
Agent if your hosts exist across multiple data centers and can be discovered by
a single agent. Check you have only one Monitoring Agent and remove old agents
after upgrading the Monitoring Agent.

A second Monitoring Agent can be set up for redundancy. However, the |mms|
Monitoring Agent is robust. |mms| sends an *Agent Down* alert only when there are
no available Monitoring Agents available. See :ref:`Monitoring FAQ
<faq-monitoring>` and :doc:`Monitoring Architecture
</tutorial/add-hosts-to-monitoring>` for more information.

Cannot Delete a Host
++++++++++++++++++++

In rare cases, the :program:`mongod` is brought down and the replica set is
reconfigured. The down host cannot be deleted and returns an error message,
"This host cannot be deleted because it is enabled for backup." `Contact |mms|
Support <https://cloud.mongodb.com/links/support>`_ for help in deleting these
hosts.
