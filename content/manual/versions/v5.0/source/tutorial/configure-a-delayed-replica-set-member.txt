To configure a delayed secondary member, set its
:rsconf:`members[n].priority` value to ``0``, its
:rsconf:`members[n].hidden` value to ``true``, and
its :rsconf:`members[n].secondaryDelaySecs` value to the
number of seconds to delay.

.. important::

   The length of the secondary
   :rsconf:`members[n].secondaryDelaySecs` must
   fit within the window of the oplog. If the oplog is shorter than
   the :rsconf:`members[n].secondaryDelaySecs`
   window, the delayed member cannot successfully replicate
   operations.

When you configure a delayed member, the delay
applies both to replication and to the member's :term:`oplog`. For
details on delayed members and their uses, see
:doc:`/core/replica-set-delayed-member`.

Example
-------

The following example sets a 1-hour delay on a secondary member
currently at the index ``0`` in the
:rsconf:`members` array. To set the delay, issue
the following sequence of operations in a :binary:`~bin.mongosh` session
that is connected to the primary:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cfg = rs.conf()
   cfg.members[0].priority = 0
   cfg.members[0].hidden = true
   cfg.members[0].secondaryDelaySecs = 3600
   rs.reconfig(cfg)

After the replica set reconfigures, the delayed secondary member cannot
become :term:`primary` and is hidden from applications. The
:rsconf:`members[n].secondaryDelaySecs` value delays both
replication and the member's :term:`oplog` by 3600 seconds (1 hour).
