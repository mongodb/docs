Procedure

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Select a version

      Different versions of Realm Studio are compatible with different Realm file
      versions. To find out which version of Realm Studio is compatible with 
      the Realm files that your Realm SDK version uses, refer to the 
      release notes for your SDK:

      - `Realm C++ SDK <https://github.com/realm/realm-cpp/releases>`__
      - `Realm .NET SDK <https://github.com/realm/realm-dotnet/releases>`__
      - `Realm Flutter SDK <https://github.com/realm/realm-dart/releases>`__
      - `Realm Java SDK <https://github.com/realm/realm-java/blob/releases/CHANGELOG.md>`__
      - `Realm Kotlin SDK <https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/blob/releases/CHANGELOG.md>`__
      - `Realm Node.js SDK <https://github.com/realm/realm-js/releases>`__
      - `Realm React Native SDK <https://github.com/realm/realm-js/releases>`__
      - `Realm Swift SDK <https://github.com/realm/realm-swift/releases>`__

      If you open an older version of a realm file in a newer Realm Studio
      version, you may see a prompt to upgrade your realm file. Once
      upgraded, you cannot revert to the older file version. You may also
      need to upgrade your SDK to a version that supports the newer file format.

      Once you have identified the version of Realm Studio that is compatible
      with your SDK version, you can download the correct binary.

   .. step:: Download the binary

      Download and extract the correct binary for your operating system.
      You can find all of the binaries for a build by visiting either of
      these pages:
      
      - `Realm Studio Releases <https://studio-releases.realm.io/>`_ page: 
        click into the release version to see all the binaries.
      - :github:`Releases on GitHub <realm/realm-studio/releases/latest>`:
        the binaries are listed as **Assets** on the build version.

   .. step:: Run the executable file

      Run the executable file. Follow installer instructions.
