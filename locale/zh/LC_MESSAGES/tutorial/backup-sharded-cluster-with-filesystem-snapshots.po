"This document describes a procedure for taking a backup of all components of "

"copy of the :program:`mongod` instance. An alternate procedure uses :program:"
"`mongodump` to create binary database dumps when file-system snapshots are "
"not available. See :doc:`/tutorial/backup-sharded-cluster-with-database-"
