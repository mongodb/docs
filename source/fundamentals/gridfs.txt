Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to store and retrieve large files in
MongoDB using **GridFS**. GridFS is a specification implemented by the
driver that describes how to split files into chunks when storing them
and reassemble them when retrieving them. The driver implementation of
GridFS is an abstraction that manages the operations and organization of
the file storage. 

You should use GridFS if the size of your files exceed the BSON document
size limit of 16MB. For more detailed information on whether GridFS is
suitable for your use case, see the :manual:`GridFS server manual page </core/gridfs>`.

See the following sections that describe GridFS operations and how to
perform them:

- :ref:`Create a GridFS bucket <gridfs-create-bucket>`
- :ref:`Store Files <gridfs-store-files>`
- :ref:`Retrieve File Information <gridfs-retrieve-file-info>`
- :ref:`Download Files <gridfs-download-files>`
- :ref:`Rename Files <gridfs-rename-files>`
- :ref:`Delete Files <gridfs-delete-files>`
- :ref:`Delete a GridFS bucket <gridfs-delete-bucket>`

How GridFS Works
----------------

GridFS organizes files in a **bucket**, a group of MongoDB collections
that contain the chunks of files and information describing them. The
bucket contains the following collections, named using the convention
defined in the GridFS specification:

- The ``chunks`` collection stores the binary file chunks.
- The ``files`` collection stores the file metadata.

When you create a new GridFS bucket, the driver creates the preceding 
collections, prefixed with the default bucket name ``fs``, unless
you specify a different name. The driver also creates an index on each
collection to ensure efficient retrieval of the files and related
metadata. The driver only creates the GridFS bucket on the first write
operation if it does not already exist. The driver only creates indexes if
they do not exist and when the bucket is empty. For more information about
GridFS indexes, see the server manual page on :manual:`GridFS Indexes </core/gridfs/#gridfs-indexes>`.

When storing files with GridFS, the driver splits the files into smaller
chunks, each represented by a separate document in the ``chunks`` collection.
It also creates a document in the ``files`` collection that contains
a file id, file name, and other file metadata. You can upload the file from
memory or from a stream. See the following diagram to see how GridFS splits
the files when uploaded to a bucket.

.. figure:: /includes/figures/GridFS-upload.png
   :alt: A diagram that shows how GridFS uploads a file to a bucket

When retrieving files, GridFS fetches the metadata from the ``files``
collection in the specified bucket and uses the information to reconstruct
the file from documents in the ``chunks`` collection. You can read the file
into memory or output it to a stream.

.. _gridfs-create-bucket:

Create a GridFS Bucket
----------------------

To store or retrieve files from GridFS, create a bucket or get a reference
to an existing one on a MongoDB database. Call the ``GridFSBuckets.create()``
helper method with a ``MongoDatabase`` instance as the parameter to
instantiate a ``GridFSBucket``. You can use the ``GridFSBucket`` instance to
call read and write operations on the files in your bucket.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start createGridFSBucket
   :end-before: end createGridFSBucket

.. _gridfs-create-custom-bucket:

To create or reference a bucket with a custom name other than the default name
``fs``, pass your bucket name as the second parameter to the ``create()``
method as shown below:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start createCustomGridFSBucket
   :end-before: end createCustomGridFSBucket

.. note::

   When you call ``create()``, MongoDB does not create the bucket if it
   does not exist. Instead, MongoDB creates the bucket as necessary such
   as when you upload your first file.

For more information about the classes and methods mentioned in this section,
see the following API Documentation:

- `GridFSBuckets <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/gridfs/GridFSBuckets.html>`__
- `GridFSBucket <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/gridfs/GridFSBucket.html>`__

.. _gridfs-store-files:

Store Files
-----------

To store a file in a GridFS bucket, you can either upload it from an instance
of ``InputStream`` or write its data to a ``GridFSUploadStream``.

For either upload process, you can specify configuration information such
as file chunk size and other field/value pairs to store as metadata. Set
this information on an instance of ``GridFSUploadOptions`` as shown in the
following code snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start uploadOptions
   :end-before: end uploadOptions

See the `GridFSUploadOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/gridfs/model/GridFSUploadOptions.html>`__
API Documentation for more information.

.. important:: Use a ``MAJORITY`` Write Concern

   When storing files in a GridFS bucket, ensure that you use the ``WriteConcern.MAJORITY``
   write concern. If you specify a different write concern, replica set elections that occur
   during a GridFS file upload might interrupt the upload process and cause some file chunks
   to be lost.
   
   For more information about write concerns, see the :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>`
   page in the Server manual.

Upload a File Using an Input Stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section shows you how to upload a file to a GridFS bucket using an input
stream. The following code example shows how you can use a ``FileInputStream`` to
read data from a file in your filesystem and upload it to GridFS by performing
the following operations:

- Read from the filesystem using a ``FileInputStream``.
- Set the chunk size using ``GridFSUploadOptions``.
- Set a custom metadata field called ``type`` to the value "zip archive".
- Upload a file called ``project.zip``, specifying the GridFS file name as "myProject.zip".

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start uploadFromInputStream
   :end-before: end uploadFromInputStream

This code example prints the file id of the uploaded file after it is
successfully saved in GridFS.

For more information, see the API Documentation on
`uploadFromStream() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/gridfs/GridFSBucket.html#uploadFromStream(java.lang.String,java.io.InputStream,com.mongodb.client.gridfs.model.GridFSUploadOptions)>`__.

Upload a File Using an Output Stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section shows you how to upload a file to a GridFS bucket by writing to
an output stream. The following code example shows how you can write to a
``GridFSUploadStream`` to send data to GridFS by performing the following
operations:

- Read a file named "project.zip" from the filesystem into a byte array.
- Set the chunk size using ``GridFSUploadOptions``.
- Set a custom metadata field called ``type`` to the value "zip archive".
- Write the bytes to a ``GridFSUploadStream``, assigning the file name
  "myProject.zip". The stream reads data into a buffer until it reaches the
  limit specified in the ``chunkSize`` setting, and inserts it as a new chunk
  in the ``chunks`` collection.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start uploadFromOutputStream
   :end-before: end uploadFromOutputStream

This code example prints the file id of the uploaded file after it is
successfully saved in GridFS.

.. note::

   If your file upload is not successful, the operation throws an exception
   and any uploaded chunks become orphaned chunks. An **orphaned chunk** is a
   document in a GridFS ``chunks`` collection that does not reference any file id
   in the GridFS ``files`` collection. File chunks can become orphaned chunks
   when an upload or delete operation is interrupted. To remove orphaned
   chunks, you must identify them using read operations and remove them using
   write operations.

For more information, see the API Documentation on
`GridFSUploadStream <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/gridfs/GridFSUploadStream.html>`__.

.. _gridfs-retrieve-file-info:

Retrieve File Information
-------------------------

In this section, you can learn how to retrieve file metadata stored in the
``files`` collection of the GridFS bucket. The metadata contains information
about the file it refers to, including:

- The id of the file
- The name of the file
- The length/size of the file
- The upload date and time
- A ``metadata`` document in which you can store any other information

To retrieve files from a GridFS bucket, call the ``find()`` method on
the ``GridFSBucket`` instance. The method returns a ``GridFSFindIterable``
from which you can access the results.

The following code example shows you how to retrieve and print file metadata
from all your files in a GridFS bucket. Among the different ways that you can
traverse the retrieved results from the ``GridFSFindIterable``, the example
uses a ``Consumer`` functional interface to print the following results:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start findAllFiles
   :end-before: end findAllFiles

The next code example shows you how to retrieve and print the file names
for all files that match the fields specified in the query filter. The example
also calls ``sort()`` and ``limit()`` on the returned ``GridFSFindIterable``
to specify the order and maximum number of results:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start findMatchingFiles
   :end-before: end findMatchingFiles

Since ``metadata`` is an embedded document, the query filter specifies the
``type`` field within the document using dot notation. See the server manual
guide on how to :manual:`Query on Embedded/Nested Documents </tutorial/query-embedded-documents/>`
for more information.

- :doc:`Limit the Number of Returned Results </crud/read-operations/limit>`

.. _gridfs-download-files:

Download Files
--------------

You can download a file from GridFS directly to a stream or you can save it
to memory from a stream. You can specify the file to retrieve using either
the file id or file name.

File Revisions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When your bucket contains multiple files that share the same file name,
GridFS chooses the latest uploaded version of the file by default. To
differentiate between each file that shares the same name, GridFS assigns
files that share the same filename a revision number, ordered by upload time.

The original file revision number is "0" and the next most recent file
revision number is "1". You can also specify negative values which
correspond to the recency of the revision. The revision value "-1"
references the most recent revision and "-2" references the next most
recent revision.

The following code snippet shows how you can specify the second revision
of a file in an instance of ``GridFSDownloadOptions``:

.. code-block:: java

   GridFSDownloadOptions downloadOptions = new GridFSDownloadOptions().revision(1);

For more information about the enumeration of revisions, see the API
documentation for `GridFSDownloadOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/gridfs/model/GridFSDownloadOptions.html>`__.

Download a File to an Output Stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download a file in a GridFS bucket to an output stream. The following
code example shows you how you can call the ``downloadToStream()`` method to
download the first revision of the file named "myProject.zip" to an
``OutputStream``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start downloadToStream
   :end-before: end downloadToStream

For more information about this method, see the
`downloadToStream() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/gridfs/GridFSBucket.html#downloadToStream(java.lang.String,java.io.OutputStream,com.mongodb.client.gridfs.model.GridFSDownloadOptions)>`__
API Documentation.

Download a File to an Input Stream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download a file in a GridFS bucket to memory by using an input
stream. You can call the ``openDownloadStream()`` method on the GridFS
bucket to open a ``GridFSDownloadStream``, an input stream from which you
can read the file.

The following code example shows you how to download a file referenced by
the ``fileId`` variable into memory and print its contents as a string:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start downloadToMemory
   :end-before: end downloadToMemory

For more information about this method, see the
`openDownloadStream()
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/gridfs/GridFSBucket.html#openDownloadStream(java.lang.String,com.mongodb.client.gridfs.model.GridFSDownloadOptions)>`__.
API Documentation.

.. _gridfs-rename-files:

Rename Files
------------

You can update the name of a GridFS file in your bucket by calling the
``rename()`` method. You must specify the file to rename by its file id
rather than its file name.

.. note::

   The ``rename()`` method only supports updating the name of one file at
   a time. To rename multiple files, retrieve a list of files matching the
   file name from the bucket, extract the file id values from the files you
   want to rename, and pass each file id in separate calls to the ``rename()``
   method.

The following code example shows you how to update the name of the file referenced
by the ``fileId`` variable to "mongodbTutorial.zip":

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start renameFile
   :end-before: end renameFile

For more information about this method, see the
`rename() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/gridfs/GridFSBucket.html#rename(org.bson.types.ObjectId,java.lang.String)>`__
API Documentation.

.. _gridfs-delete-files:

Delete Files
------------

You can remove a file from your GridFS bucket by calling the ``delete()``
method. You must specify the file by its file id rather than its file name.

.. note::

   The ``delete()`` method only supports deleting one file at a time. To
   delete multiple files, retrieve the files from the bucket, extract
   the file id values from the files you want to delete, and pass each file id
   in separate calls to the ``delete()`` method.

The following code example shows you how to delete the file referenced by the
``fileId`` variable:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start deleteFile
   :end-before: end deleteFile

For more information about this method, see the
`delete() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/gridfs/GridFSBucket.html#delete(org.bson.types.ObjectId)>`__
API Documentation.

.. _gridfs-delete-bucket:

Delete a GridFS Bucket
----------------------

The following code example shows you how to delete the default GridFS bucket
on the database named "mydb". To reference a custom-named bucket,
see the section of this guide on
:ref:`how to create a custom bucket <gridfs-create-custom-bucket>`.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/GridFSOperations.java
   :language: java
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start dropBucket
   :end-before: end dropBucket

For more information about this method, see the
`drop() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/gridfs/GridFSBucket.html#drop()>`__
API Documentation.
