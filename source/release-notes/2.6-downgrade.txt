==========================
Downgrade MongoDB from 2.6
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
of this document, particularly the :ref:`2.6-downgrade-considerations`
and the procedure for :ref:`downgrading sharded clusters
<2.6-downgrade-cluster>`.

.. _2.6-downgrade-considerations:

Downgrade Recommendations and Checklist
---------------------------------------

When downgrading, consider the following:

Downgrade Path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once upgraded to MongoDB 2.6, you **cannot** downgrade to **any** version
earlier than MongoDB 2.4. If you created ``text`` or ``2dsphere``
indexes while running 2.6, you can only downgrade to MongoDB 2.4.10 or
later.

Preparedness
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :ref:`Remove or downgrade version 2 text indexes
  <downgrade-text-index>` before downgrading MongoDB 2.6 to 2.4.

- :ref:`Remove or downgrade version 2 2dsphere indexes
  <downgrade-2dsphere-index>` before downgrading MongoDB 2.6 to 2.4.

- :ref:`downgrade-user-auth-model`. If you have upgraded to the 2.6
  user authorization model, you must downgrade the user model to 2.4
  before downgrading MongoDB 2.6 to 2.4.

Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the downgrade procedures:

- To downgrade sharded clusters, see :ref:`2.6-downgrade-cluster`.

- To downgrade replica sets, see :ref:`2.6-downgrade-replica-set`.

- To downgrade a standalone MongoDB instance, see :ref:`2.6-downgrade-standalone`.

.. _downgrade-user-auth-model:

Downgrade 2.6 User Authorization Model
--------------------------------------

If you have upgraded to the 2.6 user authorization
model, you **must first** downgrade the user authorization model to
2.4 **before** before downgrading MongoDB 2.6 to 2.4.

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- For a replica set, it is only necessary to run the downgrade process
  on the :term:`primary` as the changes will automatically replicate to
  the secondaries.

- For sharded clusters, although the procedure lists the downgrade of
  the cluster's authorization data first, you may downgrade the
  authorization data of the cluster or shards first.

- You *must* have the ``admin.system.backup_users`` and
  ``admin.system.new_users`` collections created during the upgrade
  process.

- **Important**. The downgrade process returns the user data to its
  state prior to upgrading to 2.6 authorization model. Any changes
  made to the user/role data using the 2.6 users model will be lost.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

The following downgrade procedure requires ``<database>.system.users``
collections used in version 2.4. to be intact for non-``admin``
databases:

#. Connect and authenticate to the :program:`mongod` instance for a
   single deployment or a :program:`mongos` for a sharded cluster as a
   user with the following privileges:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { resource: { db: "admin", collection: "system.new_users" }, actions: [ "find", "insert", "update" ] }
      { resource: { db: "admin", collection: "system.backup_users" }, actions: [  "find" ] }
      { resource: { db: "admin", collection: "system.users" }, actions: [ "find", "remove", "insert"] }
      { resource: { db: "admin", collection: "system.version" }, actions: [ "find", "update" ] }

#. Copy content of ``admin.system.users`` to ``admin.system.new_users``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("admin").system.users.find().forEach( function(userDoc) {
         db.getSiblingDB("admin").system.new_users.save( userDoc );
      } )

#. Update the version document for the ``authSchema``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("admin").system.version.update(
         { _id: "authSchema" },
         { $set: { currentVersion: 2 } }
      )

#. Remove content from ``admin.system.users`` collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("admin").system.users.remove( {} )

#. Copy content from ``admin.system.backup_users``, created during the
   2.6 upgrade, to ``admin.system.users``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("admin").system.backup_users.find().forEach(
         function (userDoc) {
            db.getSiblingDB("admin").system.users.insert( userDoc );
         }
      );

#. Update the version document for  the ``authSchema``:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getSiblingDB("admin").system.version.update(
         { _id: "authSchema" },
         { $set: { currentVersion: 1 } }
     )

For a sharded cluster, repeat the downgrade process by connecting to
the :term:`primary` replica set member for each shard.

Result
~~~~~~

The downgrade process returns the user data to its state prior to
upgrading to 2.6 authorization model. Any changes made to the
user/role data using the 2.6 users model will be lost.

Downgrade Updated Indexes
-------------------------

.. _downgrade-text-index:

Text Index Version Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have *version 2* text indexes (i.e. the default version for text
indexes in MongoDB 2.6), drop the *version 2* text indexes before
downgrading MongoDB. After the downgrade, enable text search and
recreate the dropped text indexes.

To determine the version of your ``text`` indexes, run
:method:`db.collection.getIndexes()` to view index specifications. For
text indexes, the method returns the version information in the field
``textIndexVersion``. For example, the following shows that the
``text`` index on the ``quotes`` collection is version 2.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 15

   {
      "v" : 1,
      "key" : {
         "_fts" : "text",
         "_ftsx" : 1
      },
      "name" : "quote_text_translation.quote_text",
      "ns" : "test.quotes",
      "weights" : {
         "quote" : 1,
         "translation.quote" : 1
      },
      "default_language" : "english",
      "language_override" : "language",
      "textIndexVersion" : 2
   }

.. _downgrade-2dsphere-index:

``2dsphere`` Index Version Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have *version 2* ``2dsphere`` indexes (i.e. the default version
for ``2dsphere`` indexes in MongoDB 2.6), drop the *version 2*
``2dsphere`` indexes before downgrading MongoDB. After the downgrade,
recreate the ``2dsphere`` indexes.

To determine the version of your ``2dsphere`` indexes, run
:method:`db.collection.getIndexes()` to view index specifications. For
``2dsphere`` indexes, the method returns the version information in the field
``2dsphereIndexVersion``. For example, the following shows that the
``2dsphere`` index on the ``locations`` collection is version 2.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 15

   {
      "v" : 1,
      "key" : {
         "geo" : "2dsphere"
      },
      "name" : "geo_2dsphere",
      "ns" : "test.locations",
      "sparse" : true,
      "2dsphereIndexVersion" : 2
   }

Downgrade MongoDB Processes
---------------------------

.. _2.6-downgrade-standalone:

Downgrade 2.6 Standalone ``mongod`` Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps outline the procedure to downgrade a standalone
:program:`mongod` from version 2.6 to 2.4.

#. Download binaries of the latest release in the 2.6 series from the
   `MongoDB Download Page`_. See :doc:`/installation` for more
   information.

#. Shut down your :program:`mongod` instance. Replace the existing
   binary with the 2.4 :program:`mongod` binary and restart
   :program:`mongod`.

.. _`MongoDB Download Page`: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

.. _2.6-downgrade-replica-set:

Downgrade a 2.6 Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps outline a "rolling" downgrade process for the
replica set. The "rolling" downgrade process minimizes downtime by
downgrading the members individually while the other members are
available:

.. include:: /includes/steps/2.6-downgrade-replica-set.rst

Replica set failover is not instant but will the set unavailable to
writes, and interrupt reads until the failover process
completes. Typically this takes 10 seconds or more. You may wish to
plan the downgrade during a predetermined maintenance window.

.. _2.6-downgrade-cluster:

Downgrade a 2.6 Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requirements
````````````

While the downgrade is in progress, you cannot make changes to the
collection meta-data. For example, during the downgrade, do
**not** do any of the following:

- :method:`sh.enableSharding()`

- :method:`sh.shardCollection()`

- :method:`sh.addShard()`

- :method:`db.createCollection()`

- :method:`db.collection.drop()`

- :method:`db.dropDatabase()`

- any operation that creates a database

- any other operation that modifies the cluster meta-data in any
  way. See :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list of
  sharding commands. Note, however, that not all commands on the
  :doc:`/reference/sharding` page modifies the cluster meta-data.

Procedure
`````````

The downgrade procedure for a sharded cluster reverses the order of
the upgrade procedure.

#. Turn off the :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing-internals>` in the
   sharded cluster, as described in
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily`.

#. Downgrade each shard, one at a time. For each shard,

   a. Downgrade the :program:`mongod` secondaries *before* downgrading
      the primary.

   #. To downgrade the primary, run :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` and
      downgrade.

#. Downgrade all 3 :program:`mongod` config server instances, leaving
   the *first* system in the :option:`mongos --configdb` argument to
   downgrade *last*.

#. Downgrade and restart each :program:`mongos`, one at a time. The
   downgrade process is a binary drop-in replacement.

#. Turn on the balancer, as described in
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-enable`.
