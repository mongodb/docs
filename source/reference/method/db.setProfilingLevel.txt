db.setProfilingLevel()
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: db.setProfilingLevel(level, [slowms])

   :param level: Specifies a profiling level, see list of possible
                 values below.

   :param slowms: Optionally modify the threshold for the profile to
                  consider a query or operation "slow."

   Modifies the current :term:`database profiler` level. This allows
   administrators to capture data regarding performance. The database
   profiling system can impact performance and can allow the server to
   write the contents of queries to the log, which might have information
   security implications for your deployment.

   The following profiling levels are available:

   =========  ==================================
   **Level**  **Setting**
   ---------  ----------------------------------
      0       Off. No profiling.
      1       On. Only includes slow operations.
      2       On. Includes all operations.
   =========  ==================================

   Also configure the :setting:`slowms` option to set the threshold
   for the profiler to consider a query "slow." Specify this value in
   milliseconds to override the default.

   This command provides a wrapper around the :term:`database command`
   :dbcommand:`profile`.

   :program:`mongod` writes the output of the database profiler to the
   ``system.profile`` collection.

   :program:`mongod` prints information about queries that take longer than
   the :setting:`slowms` to the log even when the database profiler is
   not active.
