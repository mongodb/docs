The following page outlines the system requirements for using Relational 
Migrator. For additional details on where to run {+rel-mig+}, see 
:ref:`rm-deployment-considerations`.

You can run {+rel-mig+} in multiple ways:

- Computer (can be a local desktop/labtop)
- Remote server (EC2, Azure VM, or Google compute engine instance)

.. note:

   To use {+rel-mig+}, you must access the application through a web
   browser, this requires:

   - Loading a browser on the machine running RM 
     (locally or using Windows RDP or similar).
   - Accessing remotely, which requires configuring RM in 
     Unattended mode.

The machine running the {+rel-mig+} application requires a 
minimum of 8GB of RAM. For best performance, we recommend having 16GB 
of RAM or more.
