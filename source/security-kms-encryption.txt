Configuring Encryption at Rest using your Key Management incurs
additional charges for the |service| project. To learn more, see
:ref:`advanced-security`.

You can
use one or more of the following customer key management providers
when configuring Encryption at Rest for the |service| project:

- :ref:`Amazon Web Services Key Management Service <security-aws-kms>`
- :ref:`Azure Key Vault <security-azure-kms>`
- :ref:`Google Cloud Platform Key Management Service <security-gcp-kms>`

After configuring at least one key management provider for the
|service| project, you can
enable customer key management for each |service| cluster for which
they require encryption. The key management provider does not have to
match the cluster cloud service provider.

|service| cannot rotate customer-managed encryption keys. Refer to your
key management providerâ€™s documentation for guidance on key rotation.
When you set customer key management in a project, |service| creates a
:ref:`90-day key rotation alert <alert-conditions-encryption-at-rest>`.

If your |kms| provider becomes unavailable, this doesn't disable your
cluster while it still runs. If you decide to restart your cluster, the
lack of a |kms| provider disables your cluster.

Required Access
---------------

To configure Encryption at Rest, you must have
:authrole:`Organization Owner` or :authrole:`Project Owner` access to |service|.

.. _atlas-configure-kms:

Configure |service| with Customer Key Management
------------------------------------------------

Encryption at Rest using Key Management requires valid key management
provider credentials and an encryption key. To provide these details
and enable Customer Key Management:

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-encryption-for-project.rst

.. _atlas-enable-cluster-encryption-at-rest:

Enable Customer Key Management for an |service| Cluster
-------------------------------------------------------

After you :ref:`atlas-configure-kms`, you must enable customer key
management for each |service| cluster that contains data that you want
to encrypt.

.. note::

   You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner <Project Owner>` role to
   enable customer key management for clusters in that project.

For new clusters, toggle the
:ref:`Manage your own encryption keys 
<create-cluster-enable-encryption>`
setting to :guilabel:`Yes` when you create the cluster. 

For existing clusters:

.. include:: /includes/steps/cluster-customer-key-management.rst

Validate your KMS Configuration
-------------------------------

|service| validates your |kms| configuration:

- When you add or update credentials.

- Every 15 minutes.

- On-demand with the :oas-atlas-op:`Encryption at Rest API endpoint 
  </returnOneConfigurationForEncryptionAtRestUsingCustomer-ManagedKeysForOneProject>`.

|service| shuts down all |mongod| and |mongos| processes on the next
scheduled validity check if one of the following conditions exist:

- your key management provider credentials become invalid
- someone deletes or disables your encryption key

If |service| *can't connect* to your key management provider, |service|
doesn't shut down your processes.

If |service| shuts down your clusters, the following events occur:

- |service| sends an email to the :authrole:`Project Owner` listing all
  affected clusters.

- The :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` page reflects that |service|
  disabled your clusters due to invalid Encryption at Rest settings.

You can't read or write data on disabled clusters. You *can* submit
updates to disabled clusters, such as disk and instance size changes.
|service| processes these changes once someone restores your encryption
key. |service| continues to perform maintenance and apply security
patches. Disabled clusters retain all your data, so billing continues.

.. note:: Virtual Machine Power

   While a cluster is disabled, |service| does not stop the Virtual 
   Machine (VM) the cluster is running on. |service| may perform 
   patches that reboot the server, but VM power is not cycled.

To regain access to your data:

- :ref:`Update your credentials <atlas-configure-kms>` if they have 
  changed since configuring |service| with Customer Key Management.

- :ref:`Restore your key <atlas-restore-deleted-kms-key>` if it has 
  been disabled or deleted.

.. figure:: /images/encryptionatrest-try-again.png
   :alt: The Try Again button is to the right of the Customer Master Key ID field in Atlas Advanced Security settings
   :figwidth: 50%

After updating your configuration, click :guilabel:`Try Again` to 
validate it. If you don't, |service| validates on its next scheduled 
check. All ``mongod`` and ``mongos`` processes restart after |service| 
determines your configuration to be valid.

.. warning::
   If your key was deleted, restore that key to regain access to your 
   clusters. You cannot change a key or disable Encryption at Rest 
   using Customer Key Management without a valid key.

.. _atlas-restore-deleted-kms-key:

Restore a Deleted Key
---------------------

To restore a deleted key, see your key management provider's 
documentation:

- **AWS KMS:** :aws:`Deleting Customer Master Keys </kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html>`

- **Azure Key Vault:** `Recover Deleted Key <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/keyvault/keys/recover-deleted-key/recover-deleted-key>`_

- **GCP KMS:** :gcp:`Destroying and restoring key versions </kms/docs/destroy-restore>`

Encrypted Backups
-----------------

Atlas encrypts all snapshot volumes. This secures your cluster data on
disk. Using your cloud provider's |kms|, you can:

- Encrypt your snapshot storage volumes where you store your backups.
- Encrypt the data files in your snapshots.
- Restore snapshots with the key that was active at the time the 
  snapshot was taken.
- Encrypt |pit| restore :term:`oplog` data.

You cannot restore snapshots encrypted with keys that have become 
invalid.

You cannot enable :ref:`legacy-backup` on clusters encrypted with
keys that you manage. You *can* specify a
:ref:`base snapshot schedule <retention-policy>` that backs up
every 6 hours.

To learn more about customer key management and {+Cloud-Backup+}s, see :ref:`encrypted-cloud-provider-snapshot` and
:ref:`restore-from-ear`.
