This document addresses common questions about |mms| and its use.

.. _faq-automation:

Automation FAQs
---------------

|mms| can automate management operations for your monitored MongoDB
processes, allowing you to reconfigure, stop, and restart MongoDB
through the |mms| interface.

|mms| Automation can run only on 64-bit architectures.

Can |mms| Manage an Existing MongoDB Deployment?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. See :doc:`/tutorial/nav/manage-hosts`. The deployments must run on
64-bit architectures.

How does |mms| Manage MongoDB deployments?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you provision servers in |mms| or deploy the Automation Agent in
the environment of the MongoDB deployment, each agent periodically
communicates with |mms| and performs any required the work.

Agents constantly reassess their environment to adapt their work as
necessary. If an agent encounters an issue, such as
network connectivity problems, |mms| failure, or server failure, the agents adjust
their work to compensate and safely arrive at their goal state.

Agents create plans to move from their current state to a goal state. Plans
execute in steps, where each step is autonomous and independent of
other steps.

For example, for an installation, the plan involves downloading
MongoDB, starting the process with the appropriate command line
options, initializing the replica set, waiting for a healthy
majority. The configuration reaches goal state when the replica set is
active and has a healthy majority.

What versions of MongoDB can |mms| Manage?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automation supports all versions of MongoDB after 2.4.

How many Automation Agents do I need?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use Automation, you must have an agent running on every host where
a managed MongoDB instance runs.

Is any MongoDB data transferred by the Automation Agent?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Agents do *not* transmit any data from a MongoDB deployment. The
agents only communicate deployment configuration information.

Will |mms| handle failures during an upgrade, such as |mms| going down or a network partition?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally speaking, yes. The design of the management and automation
components of |mms| do not account for *all* possible failures; however
the architecture of the system can work around many types of failures.

What types of deployment can I create in |mms|?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure all MongoDB deployment types, including standalones,
replica sets, and sharded clusters. You can also configure replica
set-member types, such as arbiter, hidden, and delayed secondary, and can
configure replica set options, such as priority level.

Monitoring FAQs
---------------

Host Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How do I add a new host or server?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

See :doc:`/tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes`.

.. "Can Ops Manager monitor itself":

.. include:: /includes/extracts/faq-monitor-backing-dbs.rst

Can I monitor Kerberos-enabled instances?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Yes. |mms| does support monitoring for
Kerberos-enabled MongoDB instances. See
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-kerberos`
for more information.

.. _db-stats-warning:

How does |mms| gather database statistics?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In most instances, |mms| will scale its request cycle to limit more
expensive statistics gathering. The DB Stats information updates every 10
minutes, and the agent will throttle the frequency to reduce the impact on
the database. [#dbstats]_ Even so, the "DB stats" operation impacts the
performance of your database, as is possible when installations have a
large number of databases and collections.

If the collection of database statistics impacts database performance,
disable database stats collection before starting your agent. Select the
:guilabel:`Settings` tab, then the :guilabel:`Group Settings` page,
and then set :guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics` to ``NO``.

.. [#dbstats] DB Stats will not appear until 30 minutes
   after you add the host to |mms|.

.. "Monitoring Agent":

.. include:: /includes/faq-agents.rst

Data Presentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What are all those vertical bars in my charts?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A *red bar* indicates a server restart.

A *orange bar* indicates the server is now a primary.

A *brown bar* indicates the server is now a secondary.

Why is my Monitoring Agent highlighted in red?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Your agent is out of date.

You can update the Monitoring Agent from the :guilabel:`Agents` page of
the :guilabel:`Settings` tab.

Data Retention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is the data retention policy for |mms|?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

|mms| retains two distinct types of data: metrics, which describe usage;
and snapshots, which back up your data.

Data-retention policies, as defined in the `Terms of Service`_, are always
subject to change.

As of this writing, |mms| preserves:

- Minute-level metrics for 48 hours.

- Hourly metrics for 64 days.

- Snapshots according to their :ref:`retention policy
  <snapshot-frequency-and-retention>`.

.. _`Terms of Service`: https://cloud.mongodb.com/links/terms-of-service

.. _faq-backup:

Backup FAQs
-----------

|mms| creates backups of MongoDB replica sets and sharded
clusters. After an initial sync to MongoDB's data centers, |mms|
tails the operation log (:manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>`)
to provide a continuous backup with point-in-time recovery of replica
sets and consistent snapshots of sharded clusters. For more
information, please review these frequently asked questions.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

What version of MongoDB does the Backup feature require?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For information on compatibility, see :doc:`/reference/mongodb-compatibility`.

What MongoDB permissions does the Backup Agent require?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you are backing up a MongoDB instance that has authentication enabled,
the Backup Agent requires elevated privileges, as described in
:ref:`required-permissions-mms-backup`.

.. seealso:: :manual:`User Privilege Roles in MongoDB </reference/user-privileges/>`.

Are there any limits to the types of deployments the Backup feature supports?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Yes. Backup does not currently support standalone deployments.
Backup has full support for replica sets and sharded clusters.

Why doesn't the Backup feature support standalone deployments?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

After an initial sync of your data, |mms| copies
data from the :term:`oplog` to provide a continuous backup with
point-in-time recovery. |mms| does not support backup of standalone servers,
which do not have an oplog. To support backup with a single
:program:`mongod` instance, you can run a one-member
replica set.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set`

How Does |mms| Measure Data Size?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

|mms| uses the following conversions to measure snapshot size and to measure
how much oplog data has been processed:

- 1 MB = 1024\ :sup:`2` bytes

- 1 GB = 1024\ :sup:`3` bytes

- 1 TB = 1024\ :sup:`4` bytes

Interface
~~~~~~~~~

How can I verify that I'm running the latest version of the Backup Agent?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If your Backup Agent is out of date, it will be highlighted in red on
the :guilabel:`Agents` page of the :guilabel:`Settings` tab.

Why is my Backup Agent highlighted in red?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If your agent is highlighted in red on the :guilabel:`Agents` page of
the :guilabel:`Settings` tab, your agent is out of date. For instructions on
updating the agent, see :doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-backup-agent`.

Operations
~~~~~~~~~~

How does the Backup Feature work?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You install the Backup Agent on a server in the same deployment with
your MongoDB infrastructure. The agent conducts an initial sync of
your data to |mms|. After the initial sync, the agent tails the
:manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>` to provide a
continuous backup of your deployment.

Where should I run the Backup Agent?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Backup Agent can run anywhere in your infrastructure that has access
to your ``mongod`` instances. To avoid contention for network and CPU
resources, *do not* run the Backup Agent on the same hosts that provide
your ``mongod`` instances.

The Backup Agent has the same performance profile impact as a secondary.
For the initial backup, the load scales with the size of your data set.
Once an initial backup exists, the load scales with oplog gigabytes used
per hour.

Can I run the Backup and Monitoring Agents on a Single System?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There is no technical restriction that prevents the Backup Agent and
the Monitoring Agent from running on a single system or host. However,
both agents have resource requirements, and running both on a single
system can affect the ability of these agents support your deployment
in |mms|.

The resources required by the Backup Agent depend on rate and size
of new oplog entries (i.e. total oplog gigabyte/per-hour produced.)
The resources required by the Monitoring Agent depend on the number of
monitored :program:`mongod` instances and the total number of
:term:`databases <database>` provided by the :program:`mongod` instances.

Can I run multiple Backup Agents to achieve high availability?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can run multiple Backup Agents for high availability. If you do, the
Backup Agents must run on different hosts.

When you run multiple Backup Agents, only one agent per group or
environment is the **primary agent**. The primary agent performs the
backups. The remaining agents are completely idle, except to log their
status as standbys and to periodically ask |mms| whether they should
become the primary.

Does the Backup Agent modify my database?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Backup Agent writes a small token called a “checkpoint" into the oplog
of the source database at a regular interval. These tokens provide a
heartbeat for backups and have no effect on the source deployment. Each
token is less than 100 bytes. See: :ref:`checkpoint` for more about
checkpoints.

Will Backup impact my production databases?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Backup feature will typically have minimal impact on
production MongoDB deployments. This impact will be similar to that of
adding a new :term:`secondary` to a :term:`replica set`.

By default, the Backup Agent will perform its initial sync,
the most resource intensive operation for backups, against
a secondary member of the replica set to limit its impact.
You may optionally configure the Backup Agent to
perform the initial sync against the replica set's :term:`primary`,
although this will increase the impact of the initial sync operation.

.. "Is my data safe":

.. include:: /includes/extracts/faq-data-security.rst

.. "Is there a limit to Backup size":

.. include:: /includes/extracts/faq-backup-size-limit.rst

What is the load on the database during the initial Backup sync?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The impact of the initial backup synchronization should be similar to
syncing a new secondary replica set member. The Backup Agent does not
throttle its activity, and attempts to perform the sync as quickly as
possible.

How do I perform maintenance on a Replica Set with Backup enabled?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Most operations in a replica set are replicated via the oplog and are
thus captured by the backup process. Some operations, however, make
changes that are *not* replicated: for these operations you *must*
have |mms| :doc:`resync from your current replica set
</tutorial/resync-backup>` to include the changes.

The following operations are not replicated and therefore require
resync:

- Renaming or deleting a database by deleting the data files in the data
  directory. As an alternative, remove databases using an operation
  that MongoDB will replicate, such as :method:`db.dropDatabase()` from
  the :program:`mongo` shell.

- Changing any data while the instance is running as a :term:`standalone`.

- Using :dbcommand:`compact` or :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` to reclaim a
  significant amount of space. This is not strictly necessary but will
  ensure that the |mms| copy of the data is resized, which means quicker
  restores and lower costs.

.. seealso:: :manual:`Maintenance Operations for Replica Set Members </tutorial/perform-maintence-on-replica-set-members>`.

.. "Does the Backup Agent Support SSL":

.. include:: /includes/extracts/faq-backup-agent-and-ssl.rst

How Do I Delete a Backup Snapshot?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can delete replica set backup snapshots and snapshots for replica sets in a
sharded cluster set if the snapshots are not needed for point-in-time restores.
See :doc:`/tutorial/delete-backup-snapshots` for details.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How can I prevent |mms| from backing up a collection?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

|mms| provides a :ref:`namespaces filter <namespaces-filter>` that
allows you to specify which collections or databases to back up.

How can I change which namespaces are backed up?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To edit the filter, see :doc:`/tutorial/edit-backup`. Changing the
:ref:`namespaces filter <namespaces-filter>` might necessitate a resync.
If so, |mms| handles the resync.

Restoration
~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| produces a copy of your data files that you can use to seed a
new deployment.

How does |mms| provide point-in-time restores?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

|mms| first creates a local restore of a snapshot preceding the point
in time and then applies the stored oplog entries to reach the
specified point-in-time.

.. only:: onprem

   The ability of |mms| to provide a given point-in-time restore
   depends on the retention policy of the snapshots and the configured
   point in time window.

   For information on retention policy and the point in time window,
   see :ref:`edit-snapshot-schedule`.

.. only:: cloud

   |mms| can build a restore to any point in time within a 24-hour
   period by replaying the oplog to the desired time.

   For procedures on restoring replica sets and sharded clusters, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/nav/backup-restore-deployments`

Can I take snapshots more frequently than every 6 hours?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

No, |mms| does not support a snapshot schedule more frequent than every 6
hours. For more information, see :ref:`snapshot-frequency-and-retention`.

Can I set my own snapshot retention policy?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Yes. You can change the schedule through the :guilabel:`Edit Snapshot
Schedule` menu option for a backed-up deployment.
Administrators can change the :ref:`snapshot frequency and retention
policy <snapshot-frequency-and-retention>` through the
:doc:`snapshotSchedule resource </reference/api/snapshot-schedule>` in the API.

For example, you may choose to capture more frequent snapshots for the
most mission critical data, and capture snapshots less frequently for less
critical data.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/faq-backup-costs.rst

.. "How many copies of my data does Cloud Manager store":

.. include:: /includes/extracts/faq-copies-of-data.rst

How long does it take to create a restore?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

|mms| transmits all backups in a compressed form from the |mms| server
to your infrastructure.

.. only:: cloud

   Within the US, |mms| sends snapshots at 50-100 Mbps. Assuming a
   compression factor of 4x and transmission speeds of 50 Mbps, a 250 GB
   snapshot will take 2.5 hours.

In addition, point-in-time restores that require creating a new
snapshot take additional time, which depends on the size of the
scheduled snapshot and the amount the oplog entries that |mms| must
apply to the preceding snapshot to roll forward to the requested
point-in-time of the backup.

Does the Backup feature perform any data validation?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Backup conducts basic corruption checks and provides an alert if any
component (e.g., the agent) is down or broken, but does not perform
explicit data validation. When it detects corruption, |mms| errs on
the side of caution and invalidates the current backup and sends an
alert.

How do I restore? What do I get when I restore?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can request a restore via |mms|, where you can then choose which
snapshot to restore and how you want |mms| to deliver the
restore. All restores require
2-factor authentication. |mms| will send an authorization code via SMS
code to your administrator. You must enter the authorization code into
the backup interface to begin the restore process.

.. include:: /includes/fact-two-factor-auth-India-limit.rst

|mms| delivers restores as ``tar.gz`` archives of
MongoDB data files.

Restore delivery options are:

- **SCP to your Infrastructure**: |mms| will transmit the
  backup to your infrastructure over a secure channel.  You must
  provide connection information for a host in your deployment.

- **Download**: |mms| will make your restore data
  available using a custom, one-time-use URL.

.. _backup-faq-scp-validation:

How do I know an SCP restore push has completed and is correct?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you receive restoration files through an SCP push, |mms| sends SHA-1
hash files, also called checksum files, along with the restore files. The
hash files have the ``.sha1`` extension,

To ensure the restore files are complete and correct, use the Unix shasum
utility:

.. code-block:: sh

   shasum -c <checksum file>

What is the SCP public key for |mms|?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

|mms| generates an SSH public key on a per user basis to
use when delivering backups via SCP. To generate a public key, select the
:guilabel:`Settings` tab and then the :guilabel:`Group Settings`
page. In the :guilabel:`Public Key for SCP Restores` section, type in a
:guilabel:`Passphrase` and click :guilabel:`GENERATE A NEW PUBLIC KEY`.
The public key will generate an SSH key and display it. Add this key
to your authorized hosts file.

See the :guilabel:`Public Key for SCP Restores` setting on the
:ref:`Group Settings page <group-settings-page>`
for more information about granting access via SSH public key.

How does |mms| handle a rollback of backed-up data?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If your MongoDB deployment experiences a :manual:`rollback
</core/replica-set-rollbacks>`, then |mms| also rolls back
the backed-up data.

|mms| detects the rollback when a :term:`tailing cursor <tailable
cursor>` finds a mismatch in timestamps or hashes of write operations.
|mms| enters a rollback state and tests three points in the oplog of your
replica set's :term:`primary` to locate a common point in history. |mms| rollback differs
from MongoDB :term:`secondary` rollback in that the common point does not
necessarily have to be the most *recent* common point.

When |mms| finds a common point, the service invalidates oplog entries
and snapshots beyond that point and rolls back to the most recent snapshot
before the common point. |mms| then resumes normal backup operations.

If |mms| cannot find a common point, a :doc:`resync
</tutorial/resync-backup>` is required.

What conditions will require a resync?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If the Backup Agent's :term:`tailing cursor <tailable cursor>` cannot keep up
with your deployment's :term:`oplog`, then you must :doc:`resync your backups
</tutorial/resync-backup>`.

This scenario might occur, for example, if:

- Your application periodically generates a lot of data, shrinking the
  primary's oplog window to the point that data is written to the oplog faster
  than |mms| can consume it.

- If the Backup Agent is running on an under-provisioned or over-used machine
  and cannot keep up with the oplog activity.

- If the Backup Agent is down for a period of time longer than the oplog size
  allows. If you bring down your agents, such as for maintenance, restart them
  in a timely manner. For more information on oplog size, see :manual:`Replica
  Set Oplog </core/replica-set-oplog>` in the MongoDB manual.

- If all you delete all replica set data and deploy a new replica set with the
  same name, as might happen in a test environment where deployments are
  regularly torn down and rebuilt.

- If there is a rollback, and |mms| cannot find a common point in the oplog.

- If an oplog event tries to update a document that does not exist in the
  backup of the replica set, as might happen if syncing from a secondary that has
  inconsistent data with respect to the primary.

Do Web or Database Hosting Companies Integrate with |mms|?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Web hosting companies can offer the ability to use |mms| with their hosted
MongoDB databases, for example, to set up software agents to monitor and backup
databases hosted on their servers. MongoDB has confirmed compatability with
MongoHQ, MongoLab, and Heroku. Implementation details depend on each
hosting company.

`MongoHQ`_ offers |mms| upon request as part of their Database as a Service
(DaaS) business.

`MongoLab`_ offers |mms| as part of their Database as a Service (DaaS) business.
MongoLab offers the service on their dedicated plans and shared replica set
plan. They also provide `instructions to tune MongoDB performance`_ with |mms| on
their servers.

MongoHQ and MongoLab are MongoDB Advanced Partners.

`Heroku`_ offers web hosting with a `MongoHQ add-on`_ and `MongoLab add-on`_ to
use MongoDB databases from these database hosting companies. Heroku also offers
|mms| monitoring of those databases with `detailed setup instructions`_.
