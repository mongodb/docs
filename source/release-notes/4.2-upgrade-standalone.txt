Prerequisites
-------------

MMAPv1 to WiredTiger Storage Engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.2 removes support for the deprecated MMAPv1 storage engine.

If your 4.0 deployment uses MMAPv1, you must change the 4.0 deployment
to :doc:`/core/wiredtiger` before upgrading to MongoDB 4.2. For details,
see :doc:`/tutorial/change-standalone-wiredtiger`.

Review Current Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With MongoDB 4.2, the :binary:`mongod <bin.mongod>` and
:binary:`mongos <bin.mongos>` processes will not start with
:ref:`4.2-mmapv1-conf-options`. Previous versions of MongoDB running
WiredTiger ignored MMAPv1 configurations options if they were specified.
With MongoDB 4.2, you must remove these from your configuration.

Feature Compatibility Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |oldversion| instance must have ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set
to ``4.0``. To check ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

The operation should return a result that includes
``"featureCompatibilityVersion" : { "version" : "4.0" }``.

To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the following
command:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.0" } )

For more information, see :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Via Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Manually
~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?tck=docs_server>`_.

See |installationdoc| for more information.
