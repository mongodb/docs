*Collations are available in MongoDB 3.4 and later.*

--------
Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to use **collations**, a set of sorting rules, to
run operations using string ordering for specific languages and locales (a
community or region that shares common language idioms).

MongoDB sorts strings using *binary collation* by default. This collation
method uses the `ASCII standard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII>`_
character values to compare and order strings. Languages and locales
have specific character ordering conventions that differ from the ASCII
standard.

For example, in Canadian French, the right-most accented character determines
the ordering for strings when the other characters are the same. Consider the
following French words: **cote**, **coté**, **côte**, and **côté**.

MongoDB sorts them in the following order using the default binary collation:

.. code-block:: none

   cote
   coté
   côte
   côté

MongoDB sorts them in the following order using the Canadian French collation:

.. code-block:: none

   cote
   côte
   coté
   côté

-----
Usage
-----

You can specify a collation when you create a new collection or new index. You
can also specify a collation for :doc:`CRUD operations </fundamentals/crud>`
and aggregations.

When you create a new collection with a collation, you define the default
collation for any of the :manual:`operations that support collation
</reference/collation/#operations-that-support-collation>` called on that
collection. You can override the collation for an operation by specifying a
different one.

.. note::

   Currently, you cannot create a collation on an existing collection. To use
   collations with an existing collection, create an index with the collation
   and specify the same collation in your operations on it.

When you create an index with a collation, you specify the sort order for
operations that use that index. To use the collation in the index, you
must provide a matching collation in the operation, and the operation must
use the index. While most index types support collation, the following
types support only binary comparison:

- :manual:`text </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/#options-for-text-indexes>`
- :manual:`2d </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/#options-for-2dsphere-indexes>`
- :manual:`geoHaystack </reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/#options-for-geohaystack-indexes>`

Collation Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The collation object contains the following parameters:

.. code-block:: javascript

   collation: {
     locale: <string>,
     caseLevel: <bool>,
     caseFirst: <string>,
     strength: <int>,
     numericOrdering: <bool>,
     alternate: <string>,
     maxVariable: <string>,
     backwards: <bool>
   }

You must specify the ``locale`` field in the collation; all other fields
are optional. For a complete list of supported locales and the default values
for the ``locale`` fields, see :manual:`Supported Languages and Locales
</reference/collation-locales-defaults/#supported-languages-and-locales>`.
For descriptions of each field, see the :manual:`Collation Document MongoDB
manual entry </reference/collation/#collation-document>`.

Collation Examples
------------------

Set a Default Collation on a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following example, we create a new collection called ``souvenirs`` and
assign a default collation with the "``fr_CA``" locale. The collation applies
to all :manual:`operations that support collation
</reference/collation/#operations-that-support-collation>` performed on that
collection.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/collation/collection-collation.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start create collection with collation
   :end-before: end create collection with collation

Any of the operations that support collations automatically apply the collation
defined on the collection. The query below searches the ``souvenirs``
collection and applies the "``fr_CA``" locale collation:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/collation/collection-collation.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start collection query without collation
   :end-before: end collection query without collation

You can specify a different collation as a parameter in an operation that
supports collations. The following query specifies the "``is``" Iceland locale
and ``caseFirst`` optional parameter with the value "``upper``":

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/collation/collection-collation.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start collection query with collation
   :end-before: end collection query with collation

Assign a Collation to an Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following example, we create a new index on the ``title`` field of
a collection with a collation set to the "``en_US``" locale.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/collation/index-collation.js
   :language: javascript

The following query uses the index we created:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/collation/query-index-collation.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start query index collation
   :end-before: end query index collation

The following queries **do not** use the index that we created.  The first
query does not include a collation and the second contains a different
strength value than the collation on the index.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/collation/query-index-collation.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start query without index collation
   :end-before: end query without index collation

Collation Query Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operations that read, update, and delete documents from a collection can use
collations. This section includes examples of a selection of these. See the
MongoDB manual for a full list of :manual:`operations that support collation
</reference/collation/#operations-that-support-collation>`.

find() and sort() Example
`````````````````````````

The following example calls both ``find()`` and ``sort()`` on a collection
that uses the default binary collation. We use the German collation by
setting the value of the ``locale`` parameter to ``de``.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/collation/find-sort-collation.js
   :language: javascript

findOneAndUpdate() Example
``````````````````````````

The following example calls the ``findOneAndUpdate()`` operation on a
collection that uses the default binary collation. The collection contains the
following documents:

.. code-block:: none

  { "_id" : 1, "first_name" : "Hans" }
  { "_id" : 2, "first_name" : "Gunter" }
  { "_id" : 3, "first_name" : "Günter" }
  { "_id" : 4, "first_name" : "Jürgen" }

Consider the following ``findOneAndUpdate()`` operation on this collection
which **does not** specify a collation:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/collation/findOneAndUpdate-collation.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start findOneAndUpdate without collation
   :end-before: end findOneAndUpdate without collation

Since "Gunter" is the first sorted result when using a binary collation, none
of the documents come lexically before and match the ``$lt`` comparison
operator in the query document. As a result, the operation does not update any
documents.

Consider the same operation with a collation specified with the locale set to
``de@collation=phonebook``. This locale specifies the ``collation=phonebook``
option which contains rules for prioritizing proper nouns, identified by
capitalization of the first letter. The ``de@collation=phonebook`` locale and
option sorts characters with umlauts before the same characters without
umlauts.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/collation/findOneAndUpdate-collation.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start findOneAndUpdate with collation
   :end-before: end findOneAndUpdate with collation

Since "Günter" lexically comes before "Gunter" using the
``de@collation=phonebook`` collation specified in ``findOneAndUpdate()``,
the operation returns the following updated document:

.. code-block:: none

  { lastErrorObject: { updatedExisting: true, n: 1 },
    value: { _id: 3, first_name: 'Günter' },
    ok: 1 }

findOneAndDelete() Example
``````````````````````````

The following example calls the ``findOneAndDelete()`` operation on a
collection that uses the default binary collation and contains the following
documents:

.. code-block:: none

  { "_id" : 1, "a" : "16" }
  { "_id" : 2, "a" : "84" }
  { "_id" : 3, "a" : "179" }

In this example, we set the ``numericOrdering`` collation parameter to ``true``
to sort numeric strings based on their numerical order instead of their
lexical order.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/collation/findOneAndDelete-collation.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start findOneAndDelete example with collation
   :end-before: end findOneAndDelete example with collation

After you run the operation above, the collection contains the following
documents:

.. code-block:: none

  { "_id" : 1, "a" : "16" }
  { "_id" : 2, "a" : "84" }

If you perform the same operation without collation on the original
collection of three documents, it matches documents based on the lexical value
of the strings ("``16``", "``84``", and "``179``"), and deletes the first
document it finds that matches the query criteria.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/collation/findOneAndDelete-collation.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start findOneAndDelete example without collation
   :end-before: end findOneAndDelete example without collation

Since all the documents contain lexical values in the ``a`` field that
match the criteria (greater than the lexical value of "``100``"), the operation
removes the first result. After you run the operation above, the collection
contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: none

   { "_id" : 2, "a" : "84" }
   { "_id" : 3, "a" : "179" }

Aggregation Example
```````````````````

To use collation with the :node-api:`aggregate </Collection.html#aggregate>`
operation, pass the collation document in the options field, after the
array of pipeline stages.

The following example shows an aggregation pipeline on a collection that uses
the default binary collation. The aggregation groups the ``first_name`` field,
counts the total number of results in each group, and sorts the results by
the German phonebook (``de@collation=phonebook`` locale) order.

.. note::

   You can specify only one collation on an aggregation.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/collation/aggregation-collation.js
   :language: javascript
