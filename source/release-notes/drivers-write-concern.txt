These release notes outline a change to all driver interfaces released
in November 2012. See release notes for specific drivers for
additional information.

Changes
-------

As of the releases listed below, there are two major changes to all
drivers:

#. All drivers will add a new top-level connection class that will
   increase consistency for all MongoDB client interfaces.

   This change is non-backward breaking: existing connection classes
   will remain in all drivers for a time, and will continue to operate
   as expected. However, those previous connection classes are now
   deprecated as of these releases, and will eventually be removed
   from the driver interfaces.

   The new top-level connection class is named ``MongoClient``, or
   similar depending on how host languages handle namespacing.

#. The default write concern on the new ``MongoClient`` class will be
   to acknowledge all write operations [#without-arguments]_. This
   will allow your application to receive acknowledgement of all write
   operations.

   See the documentation of :ref:`Write Concern <write-concern>` for
   more information about write concern in MongoDB.

   Please migrate to the new ``MongoClient`` class expeditiously.

.. [#without-arguments] The drivers will call
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` without arguments, which is logically
   equivalent to the ``w: 1`` option; however, this operation allows
   :term:`replica set` users to override the default write concern
   with the
   :rsconf:`settings.getLastErrorDefaults`
   setting in the
   :doc:`/reference/replica-configuration`.
