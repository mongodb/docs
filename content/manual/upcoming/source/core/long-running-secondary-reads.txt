   :description: Monitor automatic termination for long-running secondary reads in sharded clusters. Implement resume mechanisms to handle QueryPlanKilled errors.

Starting in MongoDB 8.2, secondary reads in sharded clusters 
might automatically terminate if there is a risk of missing documents 
due to :ref:`chunk migrations<sharding-chunk-migration>`. 


To support this new behavior, MongoDB 8.2 introduces the following changes:

- Adds :parameter:`terminateSecondaryReadsOnOrphanCleanup` parameter (default: ``true``)
  
  .. note::

     If ``terminateSecondaryReadsOnOrphanCleanup`` is set to ``false``, the server 
     does not terminate reads and might miss documents in sharded collections due to 
     chunk migrations. This is the default behavior in MongoDB 8.1 or earlier.  
     To learn more, see :ref:`secondary-reads-disable-termination`.

- Increases :parameter:`orphanCleanupDelaySecs` default value from ``900`` seconds 
  to ``3600`` seconds (1 hour)

Behavior
--------

By default, a sharded cluster performs the following operations when a 
chunk migration commits:

1. The source shard initiates an orphan cleanup process to delete documents that migrated to a different
   shard.

   a. The shard waits for any pre-existing reads on the primary to complete.
   
   b. The shard waits an additional ``orphanCleanupDelaySecs`` seconds (default: 1 hour).

   c. The shard deletes :term:`orphaned documents <orphaned document>`.

#. Secondaries terminate reads that started before the migration completed.

#. Secondaries replicate orphaned document deletions.

.. include:: images/long-running-secondary-reads.rst

Terminating secondary reads before deleting orphaned documents ensures that long-running 
secondary reads do not miss any documents deleted by the cleanup process.

.. _secondary-reads-error-monitoring:

Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~

You can monitor terminated secondary reads due to orphan cleanup in the 
following ways:

- Check the server status of your secondary node with the following 
  :binary:`~bin.mongosh` command:
  
  ``db.serverStatus().metrics.operation.killedDueToRangeDeletion``

- Review your ``mongod`` logs. Each termination results in a log 
  entry like the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "t": {
            "$date": "2025-06-11T12:11:43.361+02:00"
      },
      "s": "I",
      "c": "SHARDING",
      "id": 10016300,
      "svc": "S",
      "ctx": "conn93",
      "msg": "Read has been terminated due to orphan range cleanup",
      "attr": {
            "type": "command",
            ...
            "workingMillis": 0,
            "durationMillis": 0,
            "orphanCleanupDelaySecs": 3600
      }
   }


Managing Long-Running Secondary Reads
-------------------------------------

If your application performs secondary reads that exceed 1 hour 
on sharded clusters that perform chunk migrations, you might encounter ``QueryPlanKilled`` 
errors (error code :error:`175`) due to terminated reads.

The recommended method to manage long-running secondary reads is to 
:ref:`implement a resume mechanism <secondary-reads-resume-mechanism>` in your 
application.

You can also manage long-running secondary reads with the following alternative 
strategies:

- :ref:`secondary-reads-cleanup-delay`
- :ref:`secondary-reads-disable-termination`
- :ref:`secondary-reads-disable-balancer`

.. _secondary-reads-resume-mechanism:

Implement Resume Mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A resume mechanism allows your application to create a new read operation that starts 
where your previous read operation terminates.

To implement an effective resume mechanism, your application must use a consistent 
sort order for your query results. Consider the following factors when selecting 
a sort order for your resume mechanism:

- The sort operation should utilize an indexed field for efficient query execution.

- The sort field should contain unique values.
  
  - If the sort field values are not unique, your application must implement additional 
    logic to handle documents that share the same sort value.

Example
```````

Consider a ``cities`` database containing a ``zipcodes`` collection with the following 
structure:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
	   "state": "NY",
	   "city": "NEW YORK",
	   "zipcode": "00501"
   }

For this example, assume the ``zipcode`` field values are unique.

The following JavaScript code performs a secondary read operation to retrieve all documents 
where the ``state`` is ``NY`` and implements a resume mechanism to handle ``QueryPlanKilled``
errors:

.. code-block:: javascript

   let readDoc;
   let latestZip;

   let cursor = db.getSiblingDB("cities").zipcodes.find({
      state: "NY"
   })
   .sort({zipcode: 1})
   .readPref("secondary");

   while(cursor.hasNext()) {
      try {
         readDoc = cursor.next();
         // process `readDoc` here
         latestZip = readDoc.zipcode;
      } catch (err) {
         if (err.code === 175 &&
            err.errmsg.includes("Read has been terminated due to orphan range cleanup")) {
            console.log("Query terminated, resuming from zipcode:", latestZip);
            
            cursor = db.getSiblingDB("cities").zipcodes.find({
                  state: "NY",
                  zipcode: {$gt: latestZip}
            })
            .sort({zipcode: 1})
            .readPref("secondary");
         } else {
            throw err; // Rethrow non-termination errors
         }
      }
   }

When reviewing the example database and application logic, consider the following:

- The example code handles ``QueryPlanKilled`` errors with a resume mechanism that sorts 
  by ``zipcode``. Sorting on the ``zipcode`` field ensures a consistent order and a unique 
  sort value for each document. This allows the application to resume the read operation 
  precisely where it was terminated.

- The ``cities.zipcodes`` collection implements a ``{state: 1, zipcode: 1}`` compound index 
  to ensure the efficiency of the resume mechanism queries. Implementing this compound index 
  prevents both collection scans and in-memory sorts, and supports filter and sort operations.
  To learn more about creating effective indexes, see :ref:`esr-indexing-guideline`.

- The ``QueryPlanKilled`` error (error code ``175``) can occur for reasons other than 
  terminated secondary reads. To accurately handle ``QueryPlanKilled`` errors, you must parse 
  the ``errmsg`` field. MongoDB returns the following error message when it terminates a secondary 
  read:
  
.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      code: 175, 
      name: QueryPlanKilled, 
      categories: [CursorInvalidatedError], 
      errmsg: "Read has been terminated due to orphan range cleanup"
   }

- When the application encounters a ``QueryPlanKilled`` error due to orphan range cleanup, it uses 
  the last successfully processed zipcode as a starting point for the resumed query. The 
  :expression:`$gt` operator ensures the application does not process duplicate documents.

Test your resume mechanisms in a test environment and monitor your production cluster
to understand how often secondary reads are terminated. If terminations occur frequently, you might 
need to adjust your query patterns, or consider alternative data access approaches. To learn how to 
monitor your cluster for these errors, see :ref:`secondary-reads-error-monitoring`.


.. _secondary-reads-cleanup-delay:

Increase orphanCleanupDelaySecs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :parameter:`orphanCleanupDelaySecs` server parameter controls the time 
MongoDB waits before deleting a migrated chunk from the source shard.

Increasing ``orphanCleanupDelaySecs`` allows secondary read operations to
run for a longer period of time. You can set the ``orphanCleanupDelaySecs``
at both startup and runtime.

The following command sets ``orphanCleanupDelaySecs`` to 2 hours:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({
	   setParameter: 1,
	   orphanCleanupDelaySecs: 7200
   })

.. important::

   Increasing ``orphanCleanupDelaySecs`` means that orphaned documents 
   remain on nodes for a longer period of time. If you increase this value,
   executing a query that uses an index but does not include the shard key 
   might result in degraded performance as the query must filter more 
   orphaned documents before returning results.

.. _secondary-reads-disable-termination:

Disable Secondary Read Termination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   In MongoDB 8.1 or earlier, sharded clusters do not automatically
   terminate long-running secondary reads. To match this behavior in 
   MongoDB 8.2 or later, disable secondary read termination.

The :parameter:`terminateSecondaryReadsOnOrphanCleanup` server parameter 
controls whether long-running secondary reads automatically terminate 
before orphaned document deletion.

You can disable secondary read termination by setting ``terminateSecondaryReadsOnOrphanCleanup``
to ``false``. You can set this parameter at startup or runtime.

The following command sets ``terminateSecondaryReadsOnOrphanCleanup`` to ``false``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({
	   setParameter: 1,
	   terminateSecondaryReadsOnOrphanCleanup: false
   })

.. warning::

   If this feature is disabled and chunk migrations affect the targeted collection, 
   your secondary reads might fail to return all documents.

.. _secondary-reads-disable-balancer:

Disable the Balancer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can avoid automatically terminating long-running secondary reads by 
disabling the balancer and not performing any 
:ref:`manual migrations <migrate-ranges-sharded-cluster>`.

To disable the balancer for specific collections, use the 
:dbcommand:`configureCollectionBalancing` command's ``enableBalancing`` field.

To restrict balancer operations to specific times, see :ref:`sharding-schedule-balancing-window`.

.. warning::

   Disabling the balancer for extended periods of time can lead to unbalanced shards 
   which degrade cluster performance. Only disable the balancer if it is necessary 
   for your use case.
