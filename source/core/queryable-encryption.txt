Introduction
------------

{+qe+} gives you the ability to perform the following tasks: 

- Encrypt sensitive data fields from the client-side.
- Store sensitive data fields as fully randomized encrypted data on the database 
  server-side. 
- Run expressive queries on the encrypted data.

These tasks are all completed without the server having knowledge of the data 
it's processing.

Sensitive data is encrypted throughout its lifecycle - in-transit, at-rest, in-use, 
in logs, and backups - and only ever decrypted on the client-side, since only you 
have access to the encryption keys.

{+qe+} introduces an industry-first fast, searchable encryption 
scheme developed by the pioneers in encrypted search. The feature supports equality 
searches, with additional query types such as range, prefix, suffix, and substring 
planned for future releases.

.. _manual-qe-mechanisms:

You can set up {+qe+} using the following mechanisms:

- Automatic Encryption: Enables you to perform encrypted read and
  write operations without you having to write code to specify how to
  encrypt fields.
- {+manual-enc-title+}: Enables you to perform encrypted read and write
  operations through your MongoDB driver's encryption library. You must
  specify the logic for encryption with this library throughout your
  application.

The following table shows which MongoDB server products support which {+qe+}
mechanisms:
