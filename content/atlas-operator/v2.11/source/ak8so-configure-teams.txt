|ak8so| supports :ref:`teams <manage-teams>` for controlling access to 
your |service| projects. 

.. include:: /includes/teams-overview.rst

To manage teams with |ak8so|, specify and 
update the following custom resources:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Custom Resource
     - Purpose

   * - :ref:`atlasteam-custom-resource` 
     - Defines the team name and the users who belong to it.

   * - :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`
     - Defines the team's access roles for this project. You
       must set the :setting:`spec.teams.teamRef.name` field to match the 
       ``metadata.name`` of the :ref:`atlasteam-custom-resource` to assign 
       the team to this project.

Each time you change any of the supported custom resources, such as updating or 
removing a team, |ak8so|
:ref:`creates or updates <ak8so-create-update-process>` the 
corresponding |service| configuration.

Limitations
-----------

You must assign the team to a project by configuring both the 
:ref:`atlasteam-custom-resource` and the :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource` for 
the team to appear in the |service| UI.

For other limitations that apply to teams, see 
:ref:`<manage-teams>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

To enable teams for your |ak8so|-managed 
{+cluster+}, you must: 

- Have a running |k8s| cluster with 
  |ak8so| :ref:`deployed <ak8so-quick-start-ref>`.
- Ensure your |ipaddr| address is in the organization's |api| 
  :ref:`access list <access-list>`.

Procedure
---------

Follow these steps to enable teams for your |ak8so|-managed 
projects:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create the team.

     Create an :ref:`atlasteam-custom-resource` for each team using the following 
     example. Specify a ``metadata.name`` so that you can reference this 
     file from the :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource` and a ``spec.name`` so you 
     can differentiate this team from other teams in your organization.
     
     Add only users who are part of the organization.

     To learn more about the parameters for a team, see
     the :ref:`atlasteam-custom-resource`.

     **Example:**

     .. code-block:: sh

        cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
        apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
        kind: AtlasTeam    
        metadata:
          name: green-leaf-team
        spec:  
          name: "greenLeafTeam"               
          usernames:
            - "atlas.user1@example.com"
            - "atlas.user2@example.com"
            - "atlas.user3@example.com"
            - "atlas.user4@example.com"   
         EOF

   .. step:: Grant the team access to a project.

      To assign this team to a project, set the :setting:`spec.teams.teamRef.name` 
      field in the :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource` to match the 
      ``metadata.name`` from the previous step.

      In the :setting:`spec.teams.teamRef.roles` field, specify the team's 
      :ref:`user-roles` for this project.

      You can add more than one team. The following example shows two teams with 
      different access roles for the same project.

      To learn about the other parameters for a team,
      see :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`.

      **Example:**

      .. code-block:: sh

         cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
         apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
         kind: AtlasProject   
         metadata:
           name: my-project      
         spec:
           name: Test project
           teams:
             - teamRef:
                 name: green-leaf-team
               roles:
               - GROUP_OWNER
             - teamRef:
                 name: no-leaf-team
               roles:
               - GROUP_CLUSTER_MANAGER
               - GROUP_DATA_ACCESS_ADMIN
              
         EOF
