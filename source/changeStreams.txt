Change streams allow applications to access real-time data changes
without the complexity and risk of tailing the :term:`oplog`.
Applications can use change streams to subscribe to all data changes on
a single collection, a database, or an entire deployment, and
immediately react to them. Because change streams use the aggregation
framework, applications can also filter for specific changes or
transform the notifications at will.

Availability
------------

Change streams are available for :doc:`replica sets <replication>` and
:doc:`sharded clusters </sharding>`:

- **Storage Engine.** 

  The replica sets and sharded clusters must use the :ref:`WiredTiger
  <storage-wiredtiger>` storage engine. Change streams can also be used
  on deployments that employ MongoDB's
  :ref:`encryption-at-rest<encrypted-storage-engine>` feature.
  
- **Replica Set Protocol Version.** 

  The replica sets and sharded clusters must use replica set protocol
  version 1 (:rsconf:`pv1 <protocolVersion>`).

- **Read Concern "majority" Enablement.**

Watch Collection/Database/Deployment
------------------------------------

You can open change streams against:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - Target
     - Description

   * - A collection

     - You can open a change stream cursor for a single collection
       (except ``system`` collections, or any collections in the
       ``admin``, ``local``, and ``config`` databases).

       The examples on this page use the MongoDB drivers to open and
       work with a change stream cursor for a single collection. See
       also the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
       :method:`db.collection.watch()`.

   * - A database

     - Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can open a change stream cursor for
       a single database (excluding ``admin``, ``local``, and
       ``config`` database) to watch for changes to all its non-system
       collections.

       For the MongoDB driver method, refer to your driver
       documentation. See also the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
       :method:`db.watch()`.


   * - A deployment

     - Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can open a change stream cursor for
       a deployment (either a replica set or a sharded cluster) to
       watch for changes to all non-system collections across all
       databases except for ``admin``, ``local``, and ``config``.

       For the MongoDB driver method, refer to your driver
       documentation. See also the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
       :method:`Mongo.watch()`.

.. note:: Change Stream Examples


   The examples on this page use the MongoDB drivers to illustrate how
   to open a change stream cursor for a collection and work with the
   change stream cursor.

.. _open-change-stream:

Open A Change Stream
--------------------

To open a change stream:

- For a replica set, you can issue the open change stream operation
  from any of the data-bearing members.

- For a sharded cluster, you must issue the open change stream
  operation from the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

The following example opens a change stream for a collection and
iterates over the cursor to retrieve the change stream documents.

To retrieve the :ref:`data change event <change-stream-output>` from
the cursor, iterate the change stream cursor. For information on the
change stream event, see :ref:`change-stream-output`.

While the connection to the MongoDB deployment remains
open, the cursor remains open until one of the following occurs:

- The cursor is explicitly closed.

- An :ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>` occurs.

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/changestream-remove-shard.rst

.. note::

   The lifecycle of an unclosed cursor is language-dependent.

.. [#start-time]

   Starting in MongoDB 4.0, you can specify a ``startAtOperationTime``
   to open the cursor at a particular point in time. If the specified
   starting point is in the past, it must be in the time range of the
   oplog.

      ChangeStreamOptions(fullDocument: .updateLookup)`` to the
      ``watch()`` method.

.. note::

   If there are one or more majority-committed operations that modified
   the updated document *after* the update operation but *before* the
   lookup, the full document returned may differ significantly from the
   document at the time of the update operation.

   However, the deltas included in the change stream document always
   correctly describe the watched collection changes that applied to
   that change stream event.

   See :ref:`change-stream-output` for more information on the change
   stream response document format.

Resume a Change Stream
----------------------

Change streams are resumable by specifying a resume token to either
:ref:`resumeAfter <change-stream-resume-after>` or
:ref:`startAfter <change-stream-start-after>` when opening the cursor.

.. _change-stream-resume-after:

``resumeAfter`` for Change Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can resume a change stream after a specific event by passing a resume token
to ``resumeAfter`` when opening the cursor. For the resume token, use the
``_id`` value of the :ref:`change stream event document <change-stream-output>`.
See :ref:`change-stream-resume-token` for more information on the resume token.

.. important::

   - The oplog must have enough history to locate the operation
      associated with the token or the timestamp, if the timestamp is in
      the past.

      In the example below, the ``resumeToken`` is retrieved from the last change stream document
      and passed to the ``Watch()`` method as an option. Passing the ``resumeToken``
      to the ``Watch()`` method directs
      the change stream to attempt to resume notifications starting after the
      operation specified in the resume token.

``startAfter`` for Change Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 4.2

You can start a new change stream after a specific event by passing a resume
token to ``startAfter`` when opening the cursor. Unlike
:ref:`resumeAfter <change-stream-resume-after>`, ``startAfter`` can
resume notifications after an :ref:`invalidate event <change-event-invalidate>`
by creating a new change stream. For the resume token, use the ``_id`` value of
the :ref:`change stream event document <change-stream-output>`. See
:ref:`change-stream-resume-token` for more information on the resume token.

   - The oplog must have enough history to locate the operation
     associated with the token or the timestamp, if the timestamp is in
     the past.

Use Cases
---------

Change streams can benefit architectures with reliant business systems,
informing downstream systems once data changes are durable. For example,
change streams can save time for developers when implementing Extract,
Transform, and Load (ETL) services, cross-platform synchronization,
collaboration functionality, and notification services.

Access Control
--------------

For deployments enforcing :ref:`authentication` and :ref:`authorization
<authorization>`:

- To open a change stream against specific collection, applications
  must have privileges that grant :authaction:`changeStream` and
  :authaction:`find` actions on the corresponding collection.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { resource: { db: <dbname>, collection: <collection> }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }

- To open a change stream on a single databases, applications must have
  privileges that grant :authaction:`changeStream` and
  :authaction:`find` actions on all non-``system`` collections in a
  database.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { resource: { db: <dbname>, collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }

- To open a change stream on an entire deployment, applications must
  have privileges that grant :authaction:`changeStream` and
  :authaction:`find` actions on all non-``system`` collections for all
  databases in the deployment.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { resource: { db: "", collection: "" }, actions: [ "find", "changeStream" ] }

Event Notification
------------------

Change streams only notify on data changes that have persisted to a majority
of data-bearing members in the replica set. This ensures that notifications are
triggered only by majority-committed changes that are durable in failure
scenarios.

For example, consider a 3-member :term:`replica set` with a change stream
cursor opened against the :term:`primary`. If a client issues an insert
operation, the change stream only notifies the application of the data change
once that insert has persisted to a majority of data-bearing members.

If an operation is associated with a :doc:`transaction
</core/transactions>`, the change event document includes the
``txnNumber`` and the ``lsid``.

Collation
---------

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, change streams use ``simple`` binary
comparisons unless an explicit collation is provided. In earlier
versions, change streams opened on a single collection
(:method:`db.collection.watch()`) would inherit that collection's
default collation.
