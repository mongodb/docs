  Upgrade the :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>`
  members of the replica set one at a time:

  - Shut down the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and replace the |oldversion|
    binary with the |newversion| binary.

  - Restart the member and wait for the member to recover to
    ``SECONDARY`` state before upgrading the next secondary member.
    To check the member's state, issue :method:`rs.status()` in the
    :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

title: Upgrade the primary.
level: 5
ref: 3.4-upgrade-rs-primary
content: |
   When :method:`rs.status()`
   shows that the primary has stepped down and another member
   has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, upgrade the stepped-down primary: 

   - Shut down the stepped-down primary and replace the
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with the |newversion| binary.

   - Restart.

      On the primary, run the ``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`` command in the ``admin`` database:
   language: javascript
   code: |
      db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4" } )
   post: |
      This command must perform writes to an internal system
      collection. If for any reason the command does not complete
      successfully, you can safely retry the command on the primary as
      the operation is idempotent.
