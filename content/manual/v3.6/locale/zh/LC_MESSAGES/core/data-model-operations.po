"Modeling application data for MongoDB depends on both the data itself, as"
" well as the characteristics of MongoDB itself. For example, different "
"data models may allow applications to use more efficient queries, "
"increase the throughput of insert and update operations, or distribute "
"activity to a sharded cluster more effectively."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/data-model-operations.txt:19
msgid ""
"These factors are *operational* or address requirements that arise "
"outside of the application but impact the performance of MongoDB based "
"applications. When developing a data model, analyze all of your "
"application's :doc:`read and write operations </crud>` in conjunction "
"with the following considerations."

msgid ""
"When using the MMAPv1 storage engine, document growth can be a "
"consideration for your data model. For MMAPv1, if the document size "
"exceeds the allocated space for that document, MongoDB will relocate the "
"document on disk. With MongoDB 3.0.0, however, the default use of the "
":ref:`power-of-2-allocation` minimizes the occurrences of such re-"
"allocations as well as allows for the effective reuse of the freed record"
" space."

"When using MMAPv1, if your applications require updates that will "

msgid ""
"In MongoDB, operations are atomic at the :term:`document` level. No "
"**single** write operation can change more than one document. Operations "
"that modify more than a single document in a collection still operate on "
"one document at a time. [#record-atomicity]_ Ensure that your application"

msgid ""
"A data model that embeds related data in a single document facilitates "

"MongoDB uses :term:`sharding` to provide horizontal scaling. These "

"To distribute data and application traffic in a sharded collection, "
"MongoDB uses the :ref:`shard key <shard-key>`. Selecting the proper "

msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/data-model-operations.txt:211
msgid ""
"\"Rolling up\" these small documents into logical groupings means that "
"queries to retrieve a group of documents involve sequential reads and "

msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/data-model-operations.txt:245
msgid ""
"To optimize storage use, users can specify a value for the ``_id`` field "
"explicitly when inserting documents into the collection. This strategy "

msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/data-model-operations.txt:250
msgid ""
"You can store any value in the ``_id`` field, but because this value "

#: ../source/core/data-model-operations.txt:260

"Shortening field names reduces expressiveness and does not provide "
