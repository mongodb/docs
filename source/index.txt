|service| provides a cloud solution that simplifies deployment of MongoDB
databases by providing and maintaining the dedicated servers that MongoDB runs
on. You can focus on implementing and integrating MongoDB into your
application stack while |service| transparently handles the servers running
your databases. You deploy MongoDB without having to touch the hardware layer.

You an deploy multiple MongoDB clusters, each of which is a MongoDB
:term:`sharded cluster` or :term:`replica set`. You monitor, manage, and
reconfigure your clusters through the |service| interface.

|service| uses MongoDB 3.2 with the WiredTiger storage engine. |service| does
not support MongoDB Enterprise. You cannot bring an existing MongoDB
deployment into |service|.
