.. _multi-cluster-limitations:

Limitations
-----------

The following limitations exist for |multi-clusters|:

- Deploy only replica sets of |mongodb-multis|. Sharded cluster deployments aren't supported.
- Use |onprem| versions later than 5.0.7.
- Use only |k8s| |k8s-secrets| for your secret storage tool. The |hashicorp-vault| 
  secret storage tool isn't supported.
- For deployments where the same |k8s-op-short| instance is not managing both the
  :ref:`MongoDBOpsManager <k8s-om-specification>` and 
  :ref:`MongoDB <k8s-specification>` custom resources, 
  you must manually configure |kmip| backup encryption client settings in |onprem|. 
  To learn more, see :ref:`kmip-manual-procedure`.   
- Don't add a :github:`ServiceMonitor<prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/developer/getting-started.md>`
  to your |mongodb-multis|. The |k8s-op-short| doesn't support integration with Prometheus.

.. _multi-cluster-capabilities:

Multi-Cluster Deployment Capabilities
---------------------------------------------------------

This section describes the |multi-cluster| capabilities that you can
configure using the same procedures as the procedures for single clusters
of MongoDB resources deployed with the |k8s-op-short|. Other |multi-cluster|
capabilities have their own documentation in this guide.

- :ref:`multi-cluster-connection-string`
- :ref:`multi-cluster-security-db-users`
- :ref:`multi-cluster-queryable-backups-for-om`

.. _multi-cluster-connection-string:

Connect with |dns-srv| Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect to the |multi-cluster| database as a user, you can use
the ``connectionString.standardSrv``: :manual:`DNS seed list connection string </reference/connection-string/#dns-seed-list-connection-format>`.
This string is included in the secret that the |k8s-op-short| creates for your |multi-cluster|.
Use the same procedure for connecting to the |multi-cluster| as for single
clusters deployed with |k8s-op-short|. See :ref:`Connect to a MongoDB Database Resource from Inside Kubernetes <connect-from-inside-k8s>`
and select the tab :guilabel:`Using the Kubernetes Secret`.

.. _multi-cluster-security-db-users:

Manage Security for Database Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use these methods to manage security for database users:

- :ref:`LDAP authentication <k8s-manage-db-users-ldap>`
- :ref:`SCRAM authentication <k8s-manage-db-users-scram>`
- :ref:`TLS and X.509 for internal cluster authentication <k8s-manage-db-users-x509>`

These procedures are the same as the procedures for single clusters deployed
with the |k8s-op-short|, with the following exceptions:

- The procedures apply to replica sets only. |Multi-clusters| :ref:`don't support creating sharded clusters <multi-cluster-limitations>`.
- In the ``mongodbResourceRef``, specify the name of the |multi-cluster|
  replica set: ``name: "<my-multi-cluster-replica-set>"``.

.. _multi-cluster-queryable-backups-for-om:

Set up Queryable Backups for Single-Cluster |onprem| Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you deploy an |onprem| instance on a single |k8s| cluster with the |k8s-op-short|,
the operator-hosting cluster may also host |onprem|. In this case, you can
:ref:`configure queryable backups <configure-om-queryable-backups>`
for |onprem| resources. Queryable backups aren't supported in deployments
of |onprem| resources on multiple |k8s| clusters.

.. _multi-cluster-diagram:

Deployment Architecture and Diagrams
-------------------------------------

You can create |multi-clusters| with or without relying on a service mesh.
To learn more, see :ref:`mc_plan_external_connectivity`

In both the following diagrams, the |k8s-op-full| performs these actions:

- Watches for the |mongodb-multi| spec creation in the central cluster.
- Uses the mounted ``kubeconfig`` file to communicate with member clusters.
- Creates the necessary resources, such as ConfigMaps, Secrets, Services
  and StatefulSet |k8s| objects in each member cluster corresponding to
  the number of replica set members in the MongoDB cluster.
- Identifies the cluster for deploying each MongoDB replica set using
  the corresponding |mongodb-multi| spec, and deploys the MongoDB replica sets.
- Watches for the ``CentralCluster`` and ``MemberCluster`` events.
- Reconciles the resources it created to confirm that the |multi-cluster|
  is in the desired state.

.. include:: /includes/facts/fact-central-member-clusters.rst

Note that if the central cluster (also known as the operator cluster) fails,
you can't use the |k8s-op-short|
to change your deployment until you restore access to this cluster or
until you redeploy the |k8s-op-short| to another available |k8s| cluster.
To learn more, see :ref:`disaster-recovery-ref`.

.. _multi-cluster-diagram-with-service-mesh:

Diagram: Multi-Kubernetes Cluster Deployment with a Service Mesh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of a |multi-cluster|
across regions and availability zones. This deployment uses a service mesh,
such as Istio. The service mesh:

- Manages the discovery of MongoDB nodes deployed in different |k8s| member clusters.
- Handles communication between replica set members.

You can host your application on any of the member clusters inside the
service mesh, such as:

- On |k8s| clusters outside of the ones that you deploy with the |k8s-op-short|, or
- On the member clusters in a |multi-cluster|.

.. _multi-cluster-diagram-no-service-mesh:

Diagram: Multi-Kubernetes Cluster Deployment without a Service Mesh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of a |multi-cluster|
across regions and availability zones. This deployment doesn't rely on a
service mesh for connectivity between the |k8s| clusters hosting Pods
with MongoDB instances.

To handle external communication between MongoDB replica set members hosted
on Pods in distinct |k8s| clusters, :ref:`use external domains and DNS zones <dns-and-external-domain>`.

         deployment across regions and availability zones using the
         MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator, and without a service mesh
   :figwidth: 600px

You can host your application on any of the member clusters.
