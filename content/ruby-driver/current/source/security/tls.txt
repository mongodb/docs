Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
protocol to secure your connection to a MongoDB deployment.

To connect to a MongoDB deployment using TLS, you must perform the following steps:

- Enable a TLS connection in ``Mongo::Client``.
- Specify the client TLS certificate.
- Specify the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate to verify the server's TLS certificate.

To learn how to configure your MongoDB deployment for TLS, see the
:manual:`TLS configuration guide </tutorial/configure-ssl/>` in the
{+mdb-server+} manual.

.. note::

   This page assumes prior knowledge of TLS/SSL and access to valid certificates.
   A full description of TLS/SSL, PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) certificates, and
   CAs is beyond the scope of this documentation. To learn more about TLS, see the 
   Wikipedia entry for :wikipedia:`Transport Layer Security <Transport_Layer_Security>`.

Enable TLS
----------

You can enable TLS for the connection to your MongoDB deployment in the following ways:

- Set the ``ssl`` option to ``true`` in a new ``Mongo:Client`` object.
- Set the ``tls`` option to ``true`` in your connection string.

.. note:: SSL Naming Convention

   All {+mdb-server+} versions supported by the {+driver-short+} v2.6 and later
   implement only TLS. 2.6 and do not use SSL.
    
   For historical reasons, the Ruby driver prefixes TLS options with ``ssl`` 
   instead of ``tls``. {+driver-short+} version 3.0 and later will use the 
   ``tls`` prefix for Ruby option names.

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Mongo::Client
        :tabid: mongoclient

        To configure certificates, you must specify the following options:

        - ``ssl_cert``: The certificate file used to verify the connection to 
          a MongoDB deployment.
        - ``ssl_key``: The private keyfile used to verify the connection to 
          a MongoDB deployment.
        - ``ssl_ca_cert``: The file containing the concatenated CA certificates 
          used to validate certificates passed from the MongoDB deployment to the 
          client. If you don't specify a value for this option, the driver uses 
          the default system root certificate store as the trust anchor. 

        In the following example, the TLS certificate and corresponding private key 
        are provided in separate files:

        .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.rb
            :language: ruby
            :dedent:
            :start-after: start-enable-tls-settings
            :end-before: end-enable-tls-settings
        
        You can specify both the TLS certificate and private key in a single file, but 
        both the certificate and private key options must still be specified. In the 
        following example, the TLS certificate and the private key are both defined 
        in the same ``client.pem`` file:

        .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.rb
            :language: ruby
            :dedent:
            :start-after: start-enable-tls-settings-same-file
            :end-before: end-enable-tls-settings-same-file

    .. tab:: Connection String
        :tabid: uri

        To configure certificates, you must specify the following URI options:
        
        - ``tlsCertificateKeyFile``: The file that contains the certificate and keyfile
          used to verify the connection to a MongoDB deployment.
        - ``tlsCAFile``: The file containing the concatenated CA certificates 
          used to validate certificates passed from the MongoDB deployment to the 
          client. If you don't specify a value for this option, the driver uses 
          the default system root certificate store as the trust anchor.

        .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.rb
            :language: ruby
            :dedent:
            :start-after: start-enable-tls-uri
            :end-before: end-enable-tls-uri
        
        The file containing the certificate and key usually has a``.crt`` or ``.pem`` 
        extension.

        URI option values must be percent-encoded. This applies, for example, 
        to slashes (/) in the paths, which are encoded as ``%2f``.

Specify Client TLS Certificates
-------------------------------

The {+driver-short+} provides multiple options for you to specify
the TLS certificate, key, and CA certificate with different data or object types.

TLS Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide one of the following options to specify the TLS certificate:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 30 50

   * - Option Name
     - Data/Object Type Accepted
     - Description
   * - ``:ssl_cert``
     - ``String``
     - The certificate file path used to verify the connection to a MongoDB 
       deployment.
   * - ``:ssl_cert_object``
     - ``OpenSSL::X509::Certificate``
     - The certificate object used to verify the connection to a MongoDB 
       deployment. 
   * - ``:ssl_cert_string``
     - ``String``
     - A string containing the PEM-encoded certificate used to verify the connection to 
       a MongoDB deployment.

TLS Private Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide one of the following options to specify the TLS private key:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 30 50

   * - Option Name
     - Data/Object Type Accepted
     - Description
   * - ``:ssl_key``
     - ``String``
     - The private keyfile path used to verify the connection to a MongoDB 
       deployment.
   * - ``:ssl_key_object``
     - ``OpenSSL::PKey``
     - The private key object used to verify the connection to a MongoDB 
       deployment.
   * - ``:ssl_key_pass_phrase``
     - ``String``
     - A passphrase for the private key.
   * - ``:ssl_key_string``
     - ``String``
     - A string containing the PEM-encoded private key used to verify the 
       connection to a MongoDB deployment.

TLS CA Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provide one of the following options to specify the TLS CA certificate:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 30 50

   * - Option Name
     - Data/Object Type Accepted
     - Description
   * - ``:ssl_ca_cert``
     - ``String``
     - The file path containing concatenated CA certificates used to validate certificates 
       passed from the MongoDB deployment to the client.
   * - ``:ssl_ca_cert_object``
     - ``Array<OpenSSL::X509::Certificate>``
     - An array of objects representing the CA certificates used 
       to validate certificates passed from the MongoDB deployment to the client.
   * - ``:ssl_ca_cert_string``
     - ``String``
     - A string containing one PEM-encoded CA certificate used to validate certificates 
       passed from the MongoDB deployment to the client.

Modify the TLS Context
----------------------

If your TLS configuration requires customization, you can set TLS context hooks
by adding a native Ruby ``Proc`` object to the ``Mongo.tls_context_hooks`` 
array. Add the ``Proc`` object to the array before you create any ``Mongo::Client`` 
instances. 

The following code example enables the AES256-SHA cipher as the only cipher 
to be used for TLS:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.rb
    :language: ruby
    :dedent:
    :start-after: start-modify-context
    :end-before: end-modify-context

The {+driver-short+} TLS context options are based on native Ruby handling of SSL. To 
learn more about the TLS context options available, see the Ruby
documentation for 
`SSLContext <https://ruby-doc.org/3.2.6/exts/openssl/OpenSSL/SSL/SSLContext.html>`__.

OCSP Verification
-----------------

If the certificate provided by the server contains an OCSP endpoint URI,
the driver issues an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) request to 
the specified endpoint by default to verify the validity of the certificate.

To disable the OCSP endpoint check, set the ``:ssl_verify_ocsp_endpoint`` 
Ruby option to ``false`` or set the ``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` URI option
to ``true`` when creating a client.

.. note:: JRuby Does Not Support OCSP Verification

   Because JRuby does not correctly expose OCSP endpoint URIs,
   the driver does not check OCSP endpoints when the underlying
   application runs on JRuby.

Allow Insecure TLS
------------------

When TLS is enabled, the {+driver-short+} automatically verifies the certificate that
the server presents. When testing your code, you can disable this verification.
This is known as **insecure TLS**.

When insecure TLS is enabled, the driver requires only that the server present an
X.509 certificate. The driver accepts a certificate even if any of the following are
true: 

- The hostname of the server and the subject name (or subject alternative name) 
  on the certificate don't match.
- The certificate is expired or not yet valid. 
- The certificate doesn't have a trusted root certificate in the chain. 
- The certificate purpose isn't valid for server identification.

.. note::

   Even when insecure TLS is enabled, communication between the client and server
   is encrypted with TLS.

To enable insecure TLS, set the ``sslVerify`` client option or the ``tlsInsecure``
URI option to ``true``:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Mongo::Client
        :tabid: mongoclient

        .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.rb
            :language: ruby
            :dedent:
            :start-after: start-ssl-verify
            :end-before: end-ssl-verify

    .. tab:: Connection String
        :tabid: uri

        .. literalinclude:: /includes/connect/tls.rb
            :language: ruby
            :dedent:
            :start-after: start-tls-insecure
            :end-before: end-tls-insecure

You can similarly set the following options to disable verification for the 
certificate or hostname:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Mongo::Client
        :tabid: mongoclient

        - ``ssl_verify_certificate``: Disable certificate validation by setting the 
          option to ``false``.
        - ``ssl_verify_hostname``: Disable hostname verification by setting the option 
          to ``false``.

    .. tab:: Connection String
        :tabid: uri

        - ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates``: Disable certificate validation by setting
          the option to ``true``.
        - ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames``: Disable hostname validation by setting
          the option to ``true``.

.. warning:: Don't Use Insecure TLS in Production

   Always disable insecure TLS in production.
   
   Enabling insecure TLS in a production environment makes your application 
   insecure and potentially vulnerable to expired certificates and foreign 
   processes posing as valid client instances.
