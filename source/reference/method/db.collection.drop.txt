Definition
----------

.. method:: db.collection.drop()

   Removes a collection or :doc:`view </core/views>` from the database.
   The method also removes any indexes associated with the dropped
   collection. The method provides a wrapper around the
   :dbcommand:`drop` command.

   .. note::

      For a sharded cluster, if you use :method:`db.collection.drop()`
      and then create a new collection with the same name, you must
      either:
   
      - Flush the cached routing table on every :binary:`~bin.mongos`
        using :dbcommand:`flushRouterConfig`.
      - Use :method:`db.collection.remove()` to remove the existing
        documents and reuse the collection. Use this approach to avoid
        flushing the cache.

   :method:`db.collection.drop()` has the form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.drop()

   :method:`db.collection.drop()` takes no arguments and will produce
   an error if called with any arguments.

   :returns:
     - ``true`` when successfully drops a collection.
     - ``false`` when collection to drop does not exist.

Behavior
--------

This method obtains a write lock on the affected database and
will block other operations until it has completed.

Example
-------

The following operation drops the ``students`` collection in the
current database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.students.drop()
