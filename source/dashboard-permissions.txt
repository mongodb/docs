Dashboard permissions dictate which |charts| users have access to the
dashboard and the actions they can perform on the dashboard. The
following dashboard permissions are available:

.. _dashboard-roles:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Permission
     - Description

   * - Viewer
     - Can open a dashboard and view charts provided they have
       (at minimum) the :manual:`read
       </reference/built-in-roles/#read>` role on the data source used
       by the charts on the dashboard. If the user does not have the
       ``read`` role on a chart's corresponding data source, the
       chart will not render in the dashboard.

       ``Viewers`` cannot make any modifications to the dashboard.

   * - Author
     - Can add, modify, or delete charts, change dashboard layout, and
       rename the dashboard.

   * - Owner
     - Has all privileges of ``Author`` and can also
       :ref:`manage permissions <dashboard-permissions>` on the
       dasbhoard and :ref:`delete the dashboard
       <dashboard-delete>`.

       The creator of the dashboard automatically has the
       ``Owner`` permission. The creator cannot be removed from the
       list of dashboard users and their ``Owner`` permission cannot be
       modified.

.. note::

   It is also possible to have no permissions on a dashboard, meaning
   it will not appear on your :ref:`dashboards tab <dashboards-tab>`.
   Newly-created dashboards are not shared by default, so no one except
   the dashboard ``Owner`` can view the dashboard until more
   user permissions are added.

View Dashboard Permissions
--------------------------

To view permissions for a specific dashboard, hover over the icon
next to the dashboard's :guilabel:`Access` button. A tooltip appears
describing what permission you have on the dashboard, who the owner
of the dashboard is, and who else has access to the dashboard.

The following table lists the possible icons and their associated
permissions:

.. _dashboard-permission-icons:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Icon
     - Description

   * - :icon:`eye` Eye Icon
     - You have ``Viewer`` permission.

   * - :icon:`globe` Globe Icon
     - You have either ``Author`` or ``Owner`` permission and
       :ref:`Everyone <dashboard-access-everyone>` has some level
       of access to the dashboard.

   * - :icon:`users` Group Icon
     - You have either ``Author`` or ``Owner`` permission and
       :ref:`additional users <dashboard-specific-access>` have
       some level of access to the dashboard.

   * - :icon:`lock` Lock Icon
     - You have ``Owner`` permission and no other user has
       access.

Modify Dashboard Permissions
----------------------------

.. important::

   To modify a dashboard's :ref:`permissions <dashboard-roles>`, you
   must have the ``Owner`` role on that dashboard.

To modify dashboard permissions, either click the click the
:ref:`permission icon <dashboard-permission-icons>` at the top-right of
the dashboard from the :guilabel:`Dashboards` tab:

.. figure:: /images/charts/dashboard-permission-icon.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Dashboard permission icon

Or click the :guilabel:`Access` button at the top-right of the
dashboard within the specific dashboard view:

.. figure:: /images/charts/dashboard-access-button.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Dashboard access button

With the :guilabel:`Dashboard Permissions` dialog open, refer to the
following sections for instructions on granting a
:ref:`specific user <dashboard-specific-access>` permissions on a
dashboard and granting
:ref:`all users on your MongoDB Charts deployment
<dashboard-access-everyone>` permissions on a dashboard:

.. _dashboard-specific-access:

Specific User Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To give specific users permissions on the dashboard:

1. Search for the desired user using the search bar directly above
   where the dashboard users are listed. You can search for users
   by their username or email address.

#. Click the desired user to add them to the permissions list.

#. Use the dropdown to the right of the user's name to assign the
   appropriate :ref:`permission <dashboard-roles>`.

#. Repeat steps 1-3 for each user you would like to provide dashboard
   permissions for.

#. Click :guilabel:`Apply Changes`.

To remove permissions for a user, click the trash can icon to the right
of the user's name.

.. _dashboard-access-everyone:

Access for All Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To allow access to the dashboard for all users on your |charts|
deployment:

1. Toggle the switch on the right-side of the :guilabel:`Everyone` user
   to ``On``.

#. Select the :ref:`permission <dashboard-roles>` to apply to all |charts|
   users.

   .. note::

      If permissions are assigned to both :guilabel:`Everyone` and a
      specific user, the user's specific permissions take precedence
      over the permissions set to :guilabel:`Everyone`.

      For example, if :guilabel:`Everyone` has the ``Author``
      permission and a specific user Alice has the ``Viewer``
      permission, Alice's effective permission is ``Viewer``.

#. Click :guilabel:`Apply Changes`.
