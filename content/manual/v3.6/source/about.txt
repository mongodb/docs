About the Documentation Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB Manual uses `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org//>`_, a
sophisticated documentation engine built upon `Python Docutils
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_. The original `reStructured Text
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ files, as well as all
necessary Sphinx extensions and build tools, are available in the same
repository as the documentation.

For more information on the MongoDB documentation process, see the
`Meta Documentation <https://docs.mongodb.com/meta/>`__.

If you have any questions, please feel free to open a :issue:`Jira Case
<DOCS>`.
