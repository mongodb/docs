Overview
--------

.. only:: saas

   |MMS| provides configurable encryption, authentication, and
   authorization to ensure the security of your |MMS| agents and
   MongoDB deployments. |MMS| supports:ref:`security-ssl`,
   :ref:`security-mongodb-cr`, :ref:`security-ldap`, and
   :ref:`security-kerberos`.

.. only:: hosted

   |MMS| provides configurable encryption, authentication, and
   authorization to ensure the security of your |MMS| agents, |MMS|
   deployments, and MongoDB deployments. |MMS| supports
   :ref:`security-ssl`, :ref:`security-mongodb-cr`,
   :ref:`security-ldap`, and :ref:`security-kerberos`.

Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~

|MMS| uses :ref:`security-ssl` for encrypting communications for the
following Monitoring Agent and Backup Agent connections:

- Connections to MongoDB instances

- Connections to |MMS| servers

For information regarding |MMS| and SSL, see :ref:`security-ssl`. 

.. _security-access-control-authentication:

Access Control and Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to determine access to a
MongoDB system. When run with access control, MongoDB requires users to
authenticate themselves to determine their access.

.. only:: hosted

   If the Backing instance runs with access control, |mms| Application
   Server must authenticate to its Backing instances as a user with
   :ref:`appropriate access <server-mongodb-user-access>`.

If a MongoDB deployment runs with access control, |MMS| agents must
authenticate to the deployment as a MongoDB user with appropriate
MongoDB user roles [#roles-disambiguation]_.  

- :doc:`/reference/required-access-monitoring-agent`
- :doc:`/reference/required-access-backup-agent`

For an overview on authenticating with the supported mechanisms, see
:ref:`security-mongodb-cr`, :ref:`security-ldap`, and
:ref:`security-kerberos`.

.. _security-ssl:

SSL
---

SSL encrypts the connections made by Monitoring Agents and Backup Agents
to both MongoDB instances and to |MMS| servers. SSL encryption ensures
communications are readable only by the intended parties.

.. only:: saas

   Agents always use SSL when communicating with the |MMS| servers. You
   can also apply SSL to agent communications with your MongoDB
   deployments.

.. only:: hosted

   Agents can use SSL when communicating with the |MMS| servers and
   when communicating with the MongoDB deployment. 

   Connections to |MMS| Servers
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To ensure that the agents use SSL when connecting to the |MMS|
   servers, use an HTTPS proxy in front of |MMS|.

   You can optionally configure a Jetty instance to use HTTPS for
   connections between the |mms| application and agents. To do so, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-jetty-https`.
   
   Connections to MongoDB Deployments
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the MongoDB deployment uses SSL, you must configure the |mms| agents
as well as specify the host's :guilabel:`Use SSL` settings.

To configure the agent, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-ssl` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-ssl`.

You can specify the host's SSL settings when :doc:`adding the host
</tutorial/add-hosts-to-monitoring>` or you can :doc:`edit the
SSL setting </tutorial/edit-host-ssl-use>` for an exiting host.

.. _security-mongodb-cr:

``MONGODB-CR``
--------------

.. only:: saas

   |MMS| can use the MongoDB Challenge-Response, i.e. ``MONGODB-CR``,
   authentication mechanism to authenticate to a MongoDB deployment.

.. only:: hosted

   Application Configuration Settings
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The |mms| Application can use MongoDB Challenge-Response, i.e.
   ``MONGODB-CR``, to authenticate to the backing MongoDB instances.
   See :setting:`mongo.mongoUri` and
   :ref:`on-prem-authentication-configuration` for more information.

   Agent Configuration
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your MongoDB deployment uses ``MONGODB-CR`` for authentication, you
must create a MongoDB user for the |mms| agents as well as specify the
host's authentication settings.

To create a MongoDB user, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-cr` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-cr`.

You can specify the host's authentication settings when :doc:`adding the host
</tutorial/add-hosts-to-monitoring>`, or you can :doc:`edit
the settings </tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials>` for an
existing host.

.. _security-ldap:

LDAP
----

.. only:: saas

   |mms| agents can use the LDAP authentication mechanism to
   authenticate to the MongoDB deployment.

.. only:: hosted

   |mms| agents can use the LDAP authentication mechanism to connect
   to the MongoDB deployment. Additionally, and independently, the
   |mms| Application Server can use LDAP authentication to its Backing
   MongoDB instances.

   Application Configuration Settings
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To configure LDAP authentication between the |mms| application and
   the backing MongoDB instances, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-for-ldap-authentication`,
   :setting:`mongo.mongoUri`, :ref:`ldap-settings`, and
   :ref:`on-prem-authentication-configuration`.

   Agent Configuration
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your MongoDB deployment uses LDAP for authentication, you must
create a MongoDB user for the |mms| agents as well as specify the
host's authentication settings.

To create a MongoDB user for the agents, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-ldap` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-ldap`.

You can specify the host's authentication settings when :doc:`adding the host
</tutorial/add-hosts-to-monitoring>`, or you can :doc:`edit
the settings </tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials>` for an
existing host.

.. _security-kerberos:

Kerberos
--------

.. only:: hosted

   Application Configuration Settings
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   To enable Kerberos authentication between the MMS application and
   its :doc:`backing database
   </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>`, see
   :ref:`configuration-kerberos-settings`, :setting:`mongo.mongoUri`,
   and :ref:`on-prem-authentication-configuration`.

   Agent Configuration
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your MongoDB deployment uses Kerberos for authentication, you must
create the Kerberos Principal for the |mms| agents, create a MongoDB
user for that Kerberos Principal, edit the agent's configuration file,
and specify the host's authentication settings.

If you are running both the Monitoring Agent and the Backup Agent on
the same server, then both agents must connect as the same Kerberos
Principal. 

To create a Kerberos Principal and the associated MongoDB user as well
as edit the configuration file, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-agent-for-kerberos` and
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-backup-agent-for-kerberos`.

You can specify the host's authentication settings when :doc:`adding
the host </tutorial/add-hosts-to-monitoring>`, or you can :doc:`edit
the settings </tutorial/edit-host-authentication-credentials>` for an
existing host.

Two-Factor Authentication
-------------------------

.. only:: saas

   To activate two-factor authentication, which users and
   administrators use to authenticate to the MMS interface see:
   :doc:`/core/two-factor-authentication`.

.. only:: hosted

   To activate and manage two-factor authentication, which users and
   administrators use to authenticate to the MMS interface see:
   :doc:`/core/two-factor-authentication` and
   :doc:`/tutorial/manage-two-factor-authentication`.

.. [#roles-disambiguation]
   MongoDB user roles are separate from |MMS| :doc:`user roles
   </reference/user-roles>`.
