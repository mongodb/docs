Solution Overview
------------------
Fraud and anti-money laundering (AML) are major concerns for both businesses and
consumers, impacting financial services institutions across commercial banking and capital
markets. The volume and complexity of transactions across all areas of banking make it
easier for cyber criminals to hide fraud and commit money laundering. Traditional methods
of tackling these issues, including rule-based systems and machine learning methods, are
limited by feature engineering overhead to keep the models relevant. This results in
obsolete updates and delayed enhancements.

{+avs+} can potentially improve `fraud detection
<https://www.mongodb.com/solutions/industries/financial-services/fraud-prevention>`__ and
AML efforts by addressing these limitations, representing the next step in the evolution
of machine learning for combating fraud. Any organization that is already benefiting from
real-time analytics will find that this breakthrough in anomaly detection takes fraud
detection and AML accuracy to the next level.

This solution will look at how the convergence of real-time analytics `using MongoDB Atlas
Vector Search <https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search>`__ presents
a compelling synergy, enabling organizations to uncover deeply hidden insights before
fraud occurs. This solution leverages real-time data feeds and continuous monitoring to
detect emerging threats and adapt to evolving risk landscapes.

Building the Solution and Reference Architectures
-------------------------------------------------

How {+avs+} Can Help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A vector database like |service-fullname| makes it easier to find similarities and
relationships between different types of data. Rather than using a standalone or bolt-on
vector database, MongoDB’s modern, multi-cloud database platform empowers users to store
their operational data, metadata, and vector embeddings on `MongoDB Atlas
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database>`__ and seamlessly use `Atlas
Vector Search <https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search>`__ to index
and retrieve data for gen AI applications.

The combination of real-time analytics and {+avs+} offers a powerful synergy that
enables organizations to discover insights that are otherwise elusive with traditional
methods. MongoDB facilitates this through {+avs+} integrated with
OpenAI-generated embeddings as illustrated in Figure 1 below.

How Are Vector Embeddings for Fraud Detection and AML Created?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this solution, the fraud embedding is based on a combination of text, transactions, and
counterparty data. The AML embedding is created based on transactions, relationships
between counterparties, and their risk profiles.

The choice of data sources, including the use of unstructured data, and the creation of
one or more vector embeddings can be configured to meet your specific needs. This solution
uses OpenAI to generate vector embeddings, but you can use your preferred embedding model
as well.

Historical Vector Embeddings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The demo database is pre-populated with synthetically generated test data for both fraud
and AML embeddings. In real-world scenarios, you can generate embeddings by encoding
historical transaction data and customer profiles as vectors.

One intuitive approach is to unite the data in a data store such as MongoDB. This provides
the flexibility necessary to capture a wide variety of data types and vectorize the
relevant data fields.

In this demo, we enable meaningful `semantic search
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/semantic-search>`__ using vector embeddings to
simulate how human analysts or investigators would evaluate the transaction(s) or
suspicious cases in question.

Typically, a human analyst or investigator would first collect the relevant data (sourced
from internet or internally), synthesize the relevant structured data (date, transactions
type, amount) and unstructured or semi-structured data (transaction description, job or
business description of the person or company, relationship with the recipient, etc.) and
create a written report to provide contextual for the transactions being examined.

An anti-fraud/AML application that leverages {+avs+} can perform a similar action
easily by consolidating the data (quantitative and qualitative) to construct a textual
narrative (that can also be supplemented with `LLMs
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/artificial-intelligence/large-language-models>`__).
The constructed narrative can then be used for the vector embedding and subsequently
perform the semantic search (via {+avs+}) for similar transactions or cases.

Fraud Detection and AML Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As shown in Figure 1, incoming transaction fraud and AML aggregated text are used to
generate embeddings using an embedding model (OpenAI) first and then analyzed using
{+avs+} based on the percentage of previous transactions with similar
characteristics that were flagged for suspicious activity.

Outcome of Transaction Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **If flagged as fraudulent/suspicious:** The transaction request is declined.
- **If not flagged:** The transaction is completed successfully, and a confirmation
  message is shown.

For rejected transactions, users can contact case management services with the transaction
reference number for details. No action is needed for successful transactions.

Combining {+avs+} for Fraud Detection and AML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With the use of {+avs+} and the relevant embeddings, organizations can:

1. **Improve fraud detection accuracy:** {+avs+} captures complex,
   high-dimensional patterns that rule-based and ML models often overlook, leading to more
   precise fraud detection. By analyzing the full context of transactions, {+avs+}
   can also better uncover subtle fraud signals, improving the detection of sophisticated
   schemes that simpler models might miss.

2. **Detect new fraud schemes faster:** With real-time anomaly detection, Atlas Vector
   Search can help identify novel fraud or money laundering tactics more quickly, reducing
   the risk of emerging threats without the need for constant model retraining.

3. **Scale and adapt effortlessly:** MongoDB’s multi-model operational data store allows
   organizations to leverage structured and especially unstructured data such as text and
   images in a single operational and AI data store for fraud detection and AML, revealing
   hidden patterns that traditional systems can't process, all without adding multiple
   niche data stores and vector stores. With a highly scalable architecture combined with
   the option to deploy `dedicated search node(s)
   <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/search-nodes-now-public-preview-performance-scale-dedicated-infrastructure>`__
   for workload isolation, MongoDB helps organizations scale effortlessly with growing
   datasets and adapt dynamically to new fraud or money laundering patterns, providing a
   more flexible and future-proof anti-financial crime framework.

Why MongoDB for AML and Fraud Prevention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fraud detection and AML require a holistic platform approach as they involve diverse data
sets that are constantly evolving. Customers choose MongoDB because it is a unified data
platform that eliminates the need for niche technologies, such as a dedicated vector
database. MongoDB’s document data model incorporates any kind of data–any structure
(structured, semi-structured, and unstructured), any format, any source–no matter how
often it changes, allowing you to create a holistic picture of customers to better predict
transaction anomalies in real-time.

By incorporating {+avs+}, institutions can: 

- Build intelligent applications powered by semantic search and generative AI over any
  type of data. 

- Store vector embeddings right next to source data and metadata–vectors inserted or
  updated in the database are automatically synchronized to the vector index. 

- Optimize resource consumption, improve performance, and enhance availability with
  `Search Nodes
  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/atlas-search-overview/>`__. 

- Remove operational heavy lifting with the battle-tested, fully managed
  |service-fullname| modern, multi-cloud database platform.

Given the broad and evolving nature of fraud and AML, these areas typically require
multiple methods and a multi-modal approach. As such, a unified risk data platform offers
several advantages for organizations aiming to build effective solutions.

This `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/AML-Fraud-prevention-Demo>`__ presents a
demo where a customer accesses a bank's website to perform transactions. It focuses on the
clearing stage of the transaction, where the bank goes through a series of verifications
to combat fraud and uphold sanctions and AML laws. The demo includes an API that can flag
sanctioned customers and also apply an innovative process that constructs a textual
narrative from quantitative and qualitative data to flag both AML and fraudulent
transactions. These processes include AI embeddings as well as MongoDB functionalities
such as full-text and {+avs+}, Atlas App Services, and others.
