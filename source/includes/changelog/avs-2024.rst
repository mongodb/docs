31 May 2024 Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Upgrades to Java 21.

  .. note:: 

     |service| will reindex all of your existing |fts| indexes on the
     |service| {+cluster+} in a rolling manner. The {+atlas-ui+} will
     display alerts that indicate the timing of your reindexing.
     {+Clusters+} not using separate search nodes might notice a
     temporary increase in disk and CPU utilization during reindexing. 

  This upgrade increases the amount of parallelism for |cpu| resulting
  in better performance for vector searches. 

- Introduces changes to the |fts| |api| endpoints. To learn more, see
  :atlas:`API Changelog for May 31 2024 Release
  </reference/api-resources-spec/changelog/>`.
