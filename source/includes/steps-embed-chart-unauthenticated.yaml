   Specify the fields on which chart viewers can filter data. By
   default, no fields are specified, meaning the chart cannot be
   filtered until you explicitly allow at least one field.

   You can choose to embed your chart using an iframe or the Charts
   Embedding SDK. The iframe provides a simpler cut-and-paste method
   to embed your chart, whereas the Embedding SDK provides a more
   programmatic approach.

             a. You can customize a variety of chart properties, such as
                theme and refresh behavior.

                For detailed information on the available customization
                options for your embedded chart, see
                :ref:`embedded-chart-options`.

             b. Copy the :guilabel:`Embed Code` at the bottom of the
                dialog.
             
                The :guilabel:`Embed Code` contains an ``iframe`` which
                you can embed in your application. If you specified any
                customization options, the embed code updates to include
                those options.

                embed your chart.
