Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to modify the way that the {+driver-long+}
executes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations using
**write concern**, **read concern**, and **read preference** configurations
for replica sets.

You can set write concern, read concern, and read preference options at
the following levels:

- Client level, which sets the *default for all operation executions*
  unless overridden
- Session level
- Transaction level
- Database level
- Collection level

In the following sections, you can learn how to customize the consistency and
availability of the data in your replica sets.

.. _golang-writeconcern:

Write Concern
-------------

A write concern describes the number of data-bearing
members in a replica set that must acknowledge a write operation, such
as an insert or update, before the operation is returned as successful.
By default, the write concern requires only the primary
replica set member to acknowledge the write operation before the
operation is deemed successful.

Options
~~~~~~~

The {+driver-long+} provides the ``writeconcern`` package, which lets
you specify the write concern for a replica set. Set the write
concern using the ``SetWriteConcern()`` method with a ``WriteConcern``
type. The ``WriteConcern`` type has the following methods to
select common write concern specifications:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``Custom()``
     - | The client requests acknowledgement that write operations propagate to
         tagged members of a ``mongod`` instance. For more
         information, see the :rapid:`Write Concern specification
         </reference/write-concern/#mongodb-writeconcern-writeconcern.-custom-write-concern-name->`.
       |
       | **Parameter**: ``string``

   * - ``Journaled()``
     - | The client requests acknowledgement that write operations are
         written to the on-disk journal. For more information, see the
         :rapid:`Write Concern specification </reference/write-concern/#j-option>`.
       |
       | **Parameter**: none

   * - ``Majority()``
     - | The client requests acknowledgement that write operations propagate to the
         majority of data-bearing voting members. For more information, see the
         :rapid:`Write Concern specification
         </reference/write-concern/#mongodb-writeconcern-writeconcern.-majority->`.
       |
       | **Parameter**: none

   * - ``Unacknowledged()``
     - | The client requests requests no acknowledgment of write
         operations. For more information, see the
         :rapid:`Write Concern specification for w: 0
         </reference/write-concern/#mongodb-writeconcern-writeconcern.-number->`.
       |
       | **Parameter**: none

   * - ``W1()``
     - | The client requests acknowledgement that write operations have
         been written to memory on one node, such as the standalone mongod or
         the primary in a replica set. For more
         information, see the :rapid:`Write Concern specification for w: 1
         </reference/write-concern/#mongodb-writeconcern-writeconcern.-number->`.
       |
       | **Parameter**: none

.. tip:: Write Concern Timeout

   You cannot set a timeout on a ``WriteConcern`` instance. Instead, set
   the timeout at the operation level by using the ``WithTimeout()``
   method when creating a Context. To learn more, see
   :ref:`golang-timeout-setting` in the Connection Options guide.

If you require a more specialized write concern, you can define a custom
``WriteConcern`` struct literal. You can set the following fields in a
``WriteConcern`` struct:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``W``
     - | Specifies the number of ``mongod`` instances or tagged members
         that write operations must propagate to for acknowledgement. Common values include
         ``1``, ``0``, and ``"majority"``.
       |
       | **Type**: ``string`` or ``int``

   * - ``Journal``
     - | Specifies if write operations must be written to the on-disk
         journal for acknowledgement.
       |
       | **Type**: ``bool``

.. tip::

   You can alternatively specify a write concern in your connection
   string. See the :manual:`Server manual entry on Write Concern Options
   </reference/connection-string/#write-concern-options>` for more information.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following code shows how you can specify different write concerns
at the client and collection level. The *client-level* write concern
requests acknowledgement from two replica set members and sets journaling to
``false``. The *collection-level* write concern requests
acknowledgement from the majority of replica set members.

.. code-block:: go
   :emphasize-lines: 2-7,11-12
   
   uri := "mongodb://<hostname>:<port>"
   journal := false
   cliWC := &writeconcern.WriteConcern{
       W: 2,
       Journal: &journal,
   }
   clOpts := options.Client().ApplyURI(uri).SetWriteConcern(cliWC)
   client, err := mongo.Connect(clOpts)
   ...
   
   collWC := writeconcern.Majority()
   collOpts := options.Collection().SetWriteConcern(collWC)
   coll := client.Database("db").Collection("myColl", collOpts)

Read Concern
------------

The read concern option allows you to determine which data the client
returns from a query. The default read concern level is "local", meaning
that the client returns the instance’s most recent data, with no guarantee that
the data has been written to a majority of the replica set members.

Options
~~~~~~~

The {+driver-long+} provides the ``readconcern`` package, which lets
you specify the read concern for a replica set. Set the read concern using the
``SetReadConcern()`` method with a ``ReadConcern`` type. The ``ReadConcern``
type has the following methods to specify the read concern:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``Available()``
     - The query returns data from the instance
       with no guarantee that the data has been written to a majority of
       the replica set members. For more information, see the
       :rapid:`Read Concern specification </reference/read-concern-available/#mongodb-readconcern-readconcern.-available->`.

   * - ``Linearizable()``
     - The query returns data that reflects all
       successful writes issued with a write concern of ``majority`` and
       acknowledged prior to the start of the read operation. For more information, see the
       :rapid:`Read Concern specification </reference/read-concern-linearizable/#mongodb-readconcern-readconcern.-linearizable->`.

   * - ``Local()``
     - The query returns the instance’s most recent
       data. For more information, see the
       :rapid:`Read Concern specification </reference/read-concern-local/#mongodb-readconcern-readconcern.-local->`.

   * - ``Majority()``
     - The query returns the instance’s most recent
       data acknowledged as having been written to a majority of members
       in the replica set. For more information, see the
       :rapid:`Read Concern specification </reference/read-concern-majority/#mongodb-readconcern-readconcern.-majority->`.

   * - ``Snapshot()``
     - The query returns a complete copy of the
       data in a ``mongod`` instance at a specific point in time. Only
       available for operations within multi-document transactions. For more information, see the
       :rapid:`Read Concern specification </reference/read-concern-snapshot/#mongodb-readconcern-readconcern.-snapshot->`.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following code shows how you can specify a read concern of
"majority". The code then selects a ``Collection``
with this option.

.. code-block:: go
   :emphasize-lines: 1-2

   rc := readconcern.Majority()
   opts := options.Collection().SetReadConcern(rc)
   database := client.Database("db")
   coll := database.Collection("myCollection", opts)

.. _golang-read-pref:

Read Preference
---------------

The read preference option specifies how the MongoDB client routes read
operations to the members of a replica set. By default, an application
directs its read operations to the primary member in a replica set.

Read preference consists of the read preference mode and, optionally, a
:rapid:`tag set list </core/read-preference-tags/>`, the
:rapid:`maxStalenessSeconds </core/read-preference-staleness/>` option, and the
:rapid:`hedged read </core/read-preference-hedge-option/>` option.

Options
~~~~~~~

The {+driver-long+} provides the ``readpref`` package, which lets
you specify the read preference for a replica set. Set the read preference using the
``SetReadPreference()`` method with a ``ReadPref`` type. The ``ReadPref``
type has the following methods to specify the read preference:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``Nearest()``
     - The client reads from a random eligible replica set member,
       primary or secondary, based on a specified latency threshold. For more information, see the
       :rapid:`Read Preference Server manual entry </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-nearest>`.

   * - ``Primary()``
     - The client reads from the current replica set primary node. For more information, see the
       :rapid:`Read Preference Server manual entry </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-primary>`.

   * - ``PrimaryPreferred()``
     - The client reads from the primary node in most situations. If the primary is
       unavailable, operations read from secondary members. For more
       information, see the :rapid:`Read Preference Server manual entry </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-primaryPreferred>`.

   * - ``Secondary()``
     - The client reads from the secondary members of the replica set. For more information, see the
       :rapid:`Read Preference Server manual entry </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-secondary>`.

   * - ``SecondaryPreferred()``
     - The client reads from the secondary nodes in most situations. If the secondaries are
       unavailable, operations read from the primary member. For more information, see the
       :rapid:`Read Preference Server manual entry </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-secondaryPreferred>`.

.. tip::

   You can alternatively specify a read preference in your connection
   string. See the :manual:`Server manual entry on Read Preference
   Options </reference/connection-string/#read-preference-options>` for
   more information.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following code shows how you can specify a read preference to read
from secondary nodes. The code then selects a ``Database``
with this option.

.. code-block:: go
   :emphasize-lines: 1-2

   rp := readpref.Secondary()
   opts := options.Database().SetReadPreference(rp)
   database := client.Database("db", opts)
