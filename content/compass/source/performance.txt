       are highlighted/displayed in the table.


   * - :guilabel:`Slowest Operations`

     - Displays the slowest operations as reported by
       :manual:`db.currentOp() </reference/method/db.currentOp>`. The
       operations correspond to a given moment in the charts; i.e. as
       you move over the charts, the corresponding slowest operations
       are displayed in the table. To view the details of a slow
       operation or :ref:`stop the operation <kill-long-ops>`, click on
       the operation.

.. _kill-long-ops:

Stop Slow Operations
--------------------

You can stop slow operations from the :guilabel:`Performance Tab`.

.. important:: Required Permissions

   On deployments that require :manual:`authentication
   </core/authentication/>`, to stop operations that you don't own, you
   must have the :authaction:`killop` privilege action.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Click the query you want to stop in the :guilabel:`Slowest Operations` section.

   .. step:: In the :guilabel:`Operation Details` view, click :guilabel:`Kill Op`.

Pause the Display
-----------------

The :guilabel:`Pause` button above the graph display pauses the update
of the displays only. Pausing the performance tab does not impact the
collection of the underlying data. To restart the display updates, click
:guilabel:`Play`.

Next to the :guilabel:`Pause` button is a clock which shows the
current time while the graphs are updating. If the display is
paused, the clock shows the time at which the pause began.

Limitation
----------

The :guilabel:`Performance` tab is not available if you are connected
to a :atlas:`Data Lake </data-lake>`.
