Upgrade MongoDB to 2.4

Rolling Upgrade Limitation for 2.2.0 Deployments Running with ``auth`` Enabled
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MongoDB *cannot* support deployments that mix 2.2.0 and 2.4.0, or
greater, components. MongoDB version 2.2.1 and later processes *can*
exist in mixed deployments with 2.4-series processes. Therefore you
cannot perform a rolling upgrade from MongoDB 2.2.0 to MongoDB
2.4.0. To upgrade a cluster with 2.2.0 components, use one of the
following procedures.

1. Perform a rolling upgrade of all 2.2.0 processes to the latest
   2.2-series release (e.g. 2.2.3) so that there are no processes in
   the deployment that predate 2.2.1. When there are no 2.2.0
   processes in the deployment, perform a rolling upgrade to 2.4.0.

2. Stop all processes in the cluster. Upgrade all processes to a
   2.4-series release of MongoDB, and start all processes at the same
   time.

.. _2.4-upgrade-cluster:

Upgrade a Sharded Cluster from MongoDB 2.2 to MongoDB 2.4
---------------------------------------------------------

.. important:: Only upgrade sharded clusters to 2.4 if all members of
   the cluster are currently running instances of 2.2. The only
   supported upgrade path for sharded clusters running 2.0 is via 2.2.

Upgrading a :term:`sharded cluster` from MongoDB version 2.2 to 2.4
(or 2.3) requires that you run a 2.4 :program:`mongos`
with the :option:`--upgrade <mongos --upgrade>` option, described in
this procedure. The upgrade process does not require downtime.

The upgrade to MongoDB 2.4 adds epochs to the metadata for all
collections and chunks in the existing cluster. MongoDB 2.2 processes
are capable of handling epochs, even though 2.2 did not require them.

This procedure applies only to upgrades from version 2.2. Earlier
versions of MongoDB do not correctly handle epochs.

While the upgrade is in progress, you cannot make changes to the
collection metadata. For example, you cannot perform operations that
add shards, drop databases, or drop collections, or modify the
metadata in any other way.

.. warning::

   Once you upgrade to 2.4 and complete the upgrade procedure **do
   not** use 2.0 :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` processes in
   your cluster. 2.0 process may re-introduce old metadata formats
   into cluster metadata.

.. note::

   The upgraded config database will require more storage space than
   before, to make backup and working copies of the
   :data:`config.chunks` and :data:`config.collections` collections.
   As always, if storage requirements increase, the :program:`mongod`
   might need to pre-allocate additional data files. See
   :ref:`faq-tools-for-measuring-storage-use` for more information.

.. _2.4-upgrade-meta-data:

Sharded Cluster Upgrade Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not perform operations that modify metadata while performing this
procedure.

1. Turn off the :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing-internals>` in the
   :term:`sharded cluster`, as described in
   :ref:`sharding-balancing-disable-temporally`.

   .. optional::

      For additional security during the upgrade, you can make a
      backup of the config database using :program:`mongodump` or
      other backup tools.

#. Ensure there are no version 2.0 :program:`mongod` or
   :program:`mongos` processes still active in the sharded
   cluster. The automated upgrade process checks for 2.0 processes,
   but network availability can prevent a definitive check. Wait 5
   minutes after stopping or upgrading version 2.0 :program:`mongos`
   processes to confirm that none are still active.

#. Start a single 2.4 :program:`mongos` process with
   :setting:`configdb` pointing to the sharded cluster's :ref:`config
   servers <sharding-config-server>` and with the :option:`--upgrade
   <mongos --upgrade>` option.  The upgrade process happens before the
   process becomes a daemon (i.e. before
   :option:`--fork <mongos --fork>`.)

   You can upgrade an existing
   :program:`mongos` instance to 2.4 or you can start a new `mongos`
   instance that can reach all config servers if you need to avoid
   reconfiguring a production :program:`mongos`.

   Start the :program:`mongos` with a command that resembles the
   following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongos --configdb <config server> --upgrade

   Without the :option:`--upgrade <mongos --upgrade>` option 2.4
   :program:`mongos` processes will fail to start until the upgrade
   process is complete.

   The upgrade will prevent any chunk moves or splits from occurring
   during the upgrade process. If there are very many sharded
   collections or there are stale locks held by other failed processes,
   acquiring the locks for all collections can take
   seconds or minutes. See the log for progress updates.

#. When the :program:`mongos` process starts successfully, the upgrade is
   complete. If the :program:`mongos` process fails to start, check the
   log for more information.

   If the :program:`mongos` terminates or loses its connection to the
   config servers during the upgrade, you may always safely retry the
   upgrade.

   However, if the upgrade failed during the short critical section,
   the :program:`mongos` will exit and report that the upgrade will
   require manual intervention. To continue the upgrade process, you
   must follow the :ref:`upgrade-cluster-resync` procedure.

   .. optional::

      If the :program:`mongos` logs show the upgrade waiting for the
      upgrade lock, a previous upgrade process may still be active or
      may have ended abnormally.  After 15 minutes of no remote
      activity :program:`mongos` will force the upgrade lock. If you
      can verify that there are no running upgrade processes, you may
      connect to a 2.2 :program:`mongos` process and force the lock
      manually:

      .. code-block:: sh

         mongo <mongos.example.net>

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.getMongo().getCollection("config.locks").findOne({ _id : "configUpgrade" })

      If the process specified in the ``process`` field of this document
      is *verifiably* offline, run the following operation to force the
      lock.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.getMongo().getCollection("config.locks").update({ _id : "configUpgrade" }, { $set : { state : 0 } })

      It is always more safe to wait for the :program:`mongos` to
      verify that the lock is inactive, if you have any doubts about
      the activity of another upgrade operation.  In addition to the
      ``configUpgrade``, the :program:`mongos` may need to wait for
      specific collection locks. Do not force the specific collection
      locks.

#. Upgrade and restart other :program:`mongos` processes in the
   sharded cluster, *without* the :option:`--upgrade <mongos --upgrade>`
   option.

   See :ref:`2.4 finalize-shard-cluster-upgrade` for more information.

#. :ref:`Re-enable the balancer
   <sharding-balancing-disable-temporally>`. You can now perform
   operations that modify cluster metadata.

Once you have upgraded, *do not* introduce version 2.0 MongoDB
processes into the sharded cluster. This can reintroduce old metadata
formats into the config servers. The metadata change made by this
upgrade process will help prevent errors caused by cross-version
incompatibilities in future versions of MongoDB.

.. _upgrade-cluster-resync:

Resync after an Interruption of the Critical Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the short critical section of the upgrade that applies changes
to the metadata, it is unlikely but possible that a network
interruption can prevent all three config servers from verifying or
modifying data. If this occurs, the :ref:`config servers
<sharding-config-server>` must be re-synced, and there may be problems
starting new :program:`mongos` processes. The :term:`sharded cluster`
will remain accessible, but avoid all cluster metadata changes until
you resync the config servers. Operations that change metadata include:
adding shards, dropping databases, and dropping collections.

.. note::

   Only perform the following procedure *if* something (e.g. network,
   power, etc.) interrupts the upgrade process during the short
   critical section of the upgrade. Remember, you may always safely
   attempt the :ref:`meta data upgrade procedure
   <2.4-upgrade-meta-data>`.

To resync the config servers:

1. Turn off the :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing-internals>` in the
   sharded cluster and stop all metadata operations. If you are in the
   middle of an upgrade process (:ref:`2.4-upgrade-cluster`), you
   have already disabled the balancer.

#. Shut down two of the three config servers, preferably the last two listed
   in the :setting:`configdb` string. For example, if your :setting:`configdb`
   string is ``configA:27019,configB:27019,configC:27019``, shut down
   ``configB`` and ``configC``. Shutting down the last two config servers
   ensures that most :program:`mongos` instances will have
   uninterrupted access to cluster metadata.

#. :program:`mongodump` the data files of the active config server
   (``configA``).

#. Move the data files of the deactivated config servers (``configB``
   and ``configC``) to a backup location.

#. Create new, empty :term:`data directories <dbpath>`.

#. Restart the disabled config servers with :option:`--dbpath <mongod --dbpath>`
   pointing to the now-empty data directory and :option:`--port <mongod --port>`
   pointing to an alternate port (e.g. ``27020``).

#. Use :program:`mongorestore` to repopulate the data files on the
   disabled documents from the active
   config server (``configA``) to the restarted config servers on the new
   port (``configB:27020,configC:27020``). These config servers are now
   re-synced.

#. Restart the restored config servers on the old port, resetting the
   port back to the old settings (``configB:27019`` and ``configC:27019``).

#. In some cases connection pooling may cause spurious failures, as
   the :program:`mongos` disables old connections only after attempted
   use. 2.4 fixes this problem, but to avoid this issue in version
   2.2, you can restart all :program:`mongos` instances (one-by-one,
   to avoid downtime) and use the :method:`rs.stepDown()` method
   before restarting each of the shard :term:`replica set`
   :term:`primaries <primary>`.

#. The sharded cluster is now fully resynced; however before you
   attempt the upgrade process again, you must manually reset the
   upgrade state using a version 2.2 :program:`mongos`. Begin by
   connecting to the 2.2 :program:`mongos` with the :program:`mongo`
   shell:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo <mongos.example.net>

   Then, use the following operation to reset the upgrade process:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.getMongo().getCollection("config.version").update({ _id : 1 }, { $unset : { upgradeState : 1 } })

#. Finally retry the upgrade process, as in
   :ref:`2.4-upgrade-cluster`.

.. _2.4 finalize-shard-cluster-upgrade:

Complete Sharded Cluster Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you have successfully completed the meta-data upgrade process
described in :ref:`2.4-upgrade-meta-data`, and the 2.4
:program:`mongos` instance starts, you can upgrade the other processes
in your MongoDB deployment.

While the balancer is still disabled, upgrade the components of your
sharded cluster in the following order:

- Upgrade all :program:`mongos` instances in the cluster, in any
  order.

- Upgrade all 3 :program:`mongod` config server instances, upgrading
  the *first* system in the :option:`mongos --configdb` argument
  *last*.

- Upgrade each shard, one at a time, upgrading the :program:`mongod`
  secondaries before running :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` and
  upgrading the primary of each shard.

When this process is complete, you can now :ref:`re-enable the
balancer <sharding-balancing-disable-temporally>`.

Upgrade from 2.3 to 2.4
-----------------------

If you used a :program:`mongod` from the 2.3 or 2.4-rc (release
candidate) series, you can safely transition these databases to 2.4.0
or later; *however*, if you created ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` indexes
using a :program:`mongod` before v2.4-rc2, you will need to rebuild
these indexes. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.dropIndex( { loc: "2dsphere" } )
   db.records.dropIndex( { records: "text" } )

   db.records.ensureIndex( { loc: "2dsphere" } )
   db.records.ensureIndex( { records: "text" } )

.. _2.4-downgrade:

Downgrade MongoDB from 2.4 to Previous Versions
-----------------------------------------------

For some cases the on-disk format of data files used by 2.4
and 2.2 :program:`mongod` is compatible, and you can upgrade and
downgrade if needed. However, several new features in 2.4 require
additional attention. These features are:

- ``2dsphere`` indexes on 2.2 and earlier :program:`mongod` instances.

- ``text`` indexes on 2.2 and earlier :program:`mongod` instances.

- using a ``hashed`` index as a shard key with 2.2 and earlier
  :program:`mongos` instances

- ``hashed`` indexes on 2.0 and earlier :program:`mongod` instances.

.. note::

   In sharded clusters, once you have completed the :ref:`meta-data upgrade
   procedure <2.4-upgrade-cluster>`, you cannot use 2.0
   :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instances in the same
   cluster.

   If you complete the meta-data upgrade, you can have a mixed cluster
   that has both 2.2 and 2.4 :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
   instances, if needed. However, **do not** create ``2dsphere`` or
   ``text`` indexes in a cluster that has 2.2 components.

Considerations and Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you upgrade to MongoDB 2.4, and then need to run MongoDB 2.2 with
the same data files, consider the following limitations.

- ``2dsphere`` and ``text`` indexes do not exist in 2.2. If you
  downgrade to 2.2, you cannot use these indexes in 2.2. and you will
  need to rebuild these indexes if you later upgrade to 2.4.

- If you use a ``hashed`` index as the shard key index, which is only
  possible under ``2.4`` you will not be able to query data in this
  sharded collection. Furthermore, a 2.2 :program:`mongos` cannot
  properly route an insert operation for a collections sharded using a
  ``hashed`` index for the shard key index: any data that you insert
  using a 2.2 :program:`mongos`, will not arrive on the correct shard
  and will not be reachable by future queries.

- If you *never* create an ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` index, you can
  move between a 2.4 and 2.2 :program:`mongod` for a given data set;
  however, after you create the first ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` index
  with a 2.4 :program:`mongod` you will need to run a 2.2
  :program:`mongod` with the :option:`--upgrade <mongod --upgrade>`
  option and drop any ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` index.

Upgrade and Downgrade Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic Downgrade and Upgrade
```````````````````````````

**Except** as described below, moving between 2.2 and 2.4 is a drop-in
replacement:

- stop the existing :program:`mongod`, using the :option:`--shutdown
  <mongod --shutdown>` option as follows:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongod --dbpath /var/mongod/data --shutdown

  Replace ``/var/mongod/data`` with your MongoDB :setting:`dbpath`.

- start the new :program:`mongod` processes with the same
  :setting:`dbpath` setting, for example:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongod --dbpath /var/mongod/data

  Replace ``/var/mongod/data`` with your MongoDB :setting:`dbpath`.

.. _2.4-downgrade-pdfile:

Downgrade to 2.2 After Creating a ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` Index
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If you have created ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` indexes while running a
2.4 :program:`mongod` instance, you can downgrade at any time, by
starting the ``2.2`` :program:`mongod` with the :option:`--upgrade
<mongod --upgrade>` option as follows:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --dbpath /var/mongod/data/ --upgrade

Then, you will need to drop any existing ``2dsphere`` or ``text``
indexes using :method:`db.collection.dropIndex()`, for example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.records.dropIndex( { loc: "2dsphere" } )
   db.records.dropIndex( { records: "text" } )

.. warning::

   :option:`--upgrade <mongo --upgrade>` will run
   :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` on any database where you have created
   a ``2dsphere`` or ``text`` index, which will rebuild *all*
   indexes.

Troubleshooting Upgrade/Downgrade Operations
````````````````````````````````````````````

If you do not use :option:`--upgrade <mongod --upgrade>`, when you
attempt to start a 2.2 :program:`mongod` and you have created a
``2dsphere`` or ``text`` index, :program:`mongod` will return the
following message:

.. code-block:: none

   'need to upgrade database index_plugin_upgrade with pdfile version 4.6, new version: 4.5 Not upgrading, exiting'

While running 2.4, to check the data file version of a MongoDB
database, use the following operation in the shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getSiblingDB('<databasename>').stats().dataFileVersion

The major data file version for both 2.2 and 2.4 is ``4``, the minor
data file version for 2.2 is ``5`` and the minor data file version for
2.4 is ``6`` if you have created a ``2dsphere`` or ``text``.
