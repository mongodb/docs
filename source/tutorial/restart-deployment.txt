Overview
--------

If |a-mms|-managed MongoDB process is not currently running, you can
restart it directly from the |mms| console. 

To restart a running :term:`standalone` process, :term:`replica set`,
or :term:`sharded cluster`, see :doc:`Restart a Running Deployment
</tutorial/restart-running-deployment>`.

.. note::

   If |mms| Automation manages a :program:`mongos` process and that 
   process remains unreachable for 30 days, |mms| removes that process 
   from the :guilabel:`Deployment` tab view. If you restart the 
   :program:`mongos` process, |mms| detects it again. For more 
   information see the :alert:`is down` alert.

Procedure
