You can use the |k8s-op-short| and |com| to deploy MongoDB database
resources to a |k8s| cluster. You can use an existing |com|, or deploy
|onprem| in |k8s| to manage your databases.

The |k8s-op-short| uses |com| to manage the following MongoDB database custom resources:

- ``MongoDB``
- ``MongoDBUser``

Your |k8s-custom-resource| specifications define these resources in the |k8s-op-short|.
The |k8s-op-short| monitors these resources. When you update the
resource's specification, the |k8s-op-short| pushes these changes to
|com|, which make changes to the MongoDB deployment's configuration.

.. _mdb-resources-definition:

The ``MongoDB`` Custom Resource Definition
------------------------------------------

The |k8s-op-short| manages MongoDB database deployments
which are defined by MongoDB custom resources.

The MongoDB database |k8s-custom-resource| specification defines the
following types of the MongoDB database custom resources:

- ``Standalone``
- ``ReplicaSet``
- ``ShardedCluster``

The following diagram illustrates the composition of each type of the MongoDB
resource in the |k8s-op-short|.

.. _mdb-resources-standalone:

Standalone
~~~~~~~~~~

For the ``Standalone`` type of the MongoDB database resource, the |k8s-op-short|
deploys a replica set with a single member to the |k8s| cluster as a
|k8s-statefulset|.

The |k8s-op-short| creates the StatefulSet, which contains the Pod
specification with the number of Pods to create. The |k8s-op-short|
relies on the |k8s| StatefulSet Controller to create a Pod for this
standalone MongoDB database instance.

.. important::

   In |k8s|, a ``Standalone`` resource is equivalent to a ``ReplicaSet``
   resource with only one member. We recommend that you deploy
   a ``ReplicaSet`` with one member instead of a ``Standalone``
   because a replica set allows you to add members to it in
   the future.

.. _mdb-resources-rs:

Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~

For the ``ReplicaSet`` type of the MongoDB resource, the |k8s-op-short|
deploys a replica set to the |k8s| cluster as a |k8s-statefulset|, with
a number of members equal to the value of :setting:`spec.members`.

The |k8s-op-short| relies on the |k8s| StatefulSet Controller to create
one Pod in the StatefulSet for each member of the replica set.

Each Pod in the StatefulSet runs a {+mdbagent+} instance.

.. _mdb-resources-sharded:

Sharded Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ShardedCluster`` type of the MongoDB resource consists of one or more
Config Servers, |mongos| instances, and shard members.

For the ``ShardedCluster`` resource, the |k8s-op-short| deploys:

- One StatefulSet for all Config Servers
- One StatefulSet for all |mongos| instances
- One StatefulSet for each Shard Member

The |k8s-op-short| relies on the |k8s| StatefulSet Controller to
create one Pod in each of the StatefulSets created for the sharded cluster.

.. _mdb-resources-reconcile:

Reconciling the ``MongoDB`` Custom Resource
-------------------------------------------

When you apply a MongoDB custom resource specification,
the |k8s-op-short| deploys each resource as a |k8s-statefulset|
to the |k8s| cluster.

The |k8s-op-short|:

- Watches the custom resource's specification and associated
  |k8s-configmap-def| or |k8s-secret| for changes.
- Validates the changes when the specification file, the ConfigMap,
  or the secret change.
- Makes the appropriate updates to the MongoDB database resources
  in the |k8s| cluster.
- Pushes the changes to |com|, which make changes to the MongoDB
  deployment's configuration.

Reconciliation Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you create or change a MongoDB resource specification, or when you make
changes to an associated |k8s-configmap-def| or |k8s-secret|, the |k8s-op-short|
performs the following actions to reconcile the changes:

1. Reads the required organization and project configuration
   from the :ref:`ConfigMap <example-k8s-configmap>`
   that you used to create or connect to a project in the |k8s-op-short|.

   If you change your resource specification, the |k8s-op-short| identifies
   that the change took place, and checks the specification for the ConfigMap
   specified in :setting:`spec.opsManager.configMapRef.name`.

   .. note::
      
      When you configure the |k8s-op-short| for MongoDB resources,
      you :ref:`create a ConfigMap <example-k8s-configmap>` to connect
      or create your |com| project. The {+mdbagent+} uses this ConfigMap
      to start or make changes to the deployment for the MongoDB resource.

2. Reads the authentication configuration for |com| from
   the secret specified in :setting:`spec.credentials` in the
   resource specification. This secret stores the
   :cloudmgr:`Cloud Manager API keys </reference/api/agentapikeys/create-one-agent-api-key>`
   or the :opsmgr:`Ops Manager API Keys </tutorial/manage-agent-api-key/>`
   required for the |k8s-op-short| to authenticate to |com|.
   
   .. note::
      
      When you configure the |k8s-op-short| for MongoDB resources,
      you :ref:`create this secret <create-k8s-secret>`.

3. The |k8s-op-short| connects to |com| and performs the following actions:

   - Reads the organization specified in the ``OrgId`` field in the ConfigMap,
     or uses the organization that has the same name as the project in |com|.

   - Reads a project name specified in the ``projectName`` field in the
     ConfigMap, or creates this project in |com| if it doesn't exist.

   - Checks that the ``<project-id>-group-secret`` secret
     created by the |k8s-op-short| for the {+mdbagent+} exists.
     The |k8s-op-short| reads the secret, or, creates it with
     :opsmgr:`Ops Manager API keys
     </reference/api/agentapikeys/create-one-agent-api-key>`
     or :cloudmgr:`Cloud Manager API keys
     </reference/api/agentapikeys/create-one-agent-api-key>`.
     
   - Registers itself as a watcher of the ConfigMap and this secret.
     This enables the |k8s-op-short| to react to changes that you make
     to the ConfigMap or the secret.

4. The |k8s-op-short| verifies any :ref:`TLS and X.509 certificates <k8s-secure-resources>`.
      
   - If :ref:`TLS <secure-tls>` is enabled for a replica set, the
     |k8s-op-short| looks for certificates provided in the
     ``<resource-name>-cert`` secret.
     
   - If :ref:`TLS <secure-tls>` is enabled for a sharded cluster, the
     |k8s-op-short| looks for certificates in these secrets:
      
     - ``<resource-name>-x-cert`` for each shard member.
     - ``<resource-name>-config-cert`` for all config servers.
     - ``<resource-name>-mongos-cert`` for all |mongos| instances.

   - If :ref:`X.509 <create-x509-certs>` or
     :ref:`internal authentication with X.509 and  TLS <secure-internal-auth>`
     are enabled, the |k8s-op-short| checks that their certificates
     contain the required configuration.

5. The |k8s-op-short| locates and updates the necessary StatefulSets,
   or creates new StatefulSets if they don't exist. The number of
   StatefulSets depends on the type of the MongoDB resource.

   - For ``ReplicaSet`` or ``Standalone`` resources,
     the |k8s-op-short| creates a single StatefulSet.

   - For a ``ShardedCluster`` resource, the |k8s-op-short| creates:
    
     - One StatefulSet for all config servers.
     - One StatefulSet for all |mongos| instances.
     - One StatefulSet for each shard member.
   
     At this point, each Pod runs at least one {+mdbagent+} instance,
     but does not yet contain |mongod| instances.
        
   - Each {+mdbagent+} instance starts polling |com| to receive the
     MongoDB automation configuration.
     
     .. note::
        When the {+mdbagent+} receives the configuration for the first
        time, it downloads the MongoDB binaries with the version
        specified in :setting:`spec.version` from the Internet, or
        from |onprem|, if the {+mdbagent+} is configured in the local mode.
     
   - After the {+mdbagent+} receives the automation configuration, it starts a
     |mongod| instance on the corresponding Pod.

   - For each Pod of each StatefulSet that the MondoDB custom resource creates,
     except for |Mongos| StatefulSets, the |k8s-op-short| generates a |k8s-pvc|.
     You can override this behavior by setting :setting:`spec.persistent` to
     ``false`` in the resource specification.

6. The |k8s-op-short| updates the automation configuration it received from the
   {+mdbagent+} with changes from the specifications and sends it to |com|.

   - Each {+mdbagent+} for each Pod polls |com| again and receives the
     updated automation configuration.

   - If you change any field in the specification, the |k8s-op-short|
     performs a |k8s-rolling-update| of the StatefulSets to start new Pods
     matching the new specification.
     
   - The |k8s-op-short| waits for each {+mdbagent+} to report that it reached
     the ready state.

   .. note::

      If you change the :ref:`security configuration <k8s-secure-resources>`
      of a database resource, or :k8sdocs:`scale down
      </tasks/run-application/scale-stateful-set/>`
      an existing StatefulSet, the |k8s-op-short| runs step 6 before it
      runs  step 5.

7. The |k8s-op-short| updates the |k8s| services, or for a new MongoDB
   resource, creates the services required for each new StatefulSet.

   For the |k8s-service-type| ``ClusterIP``, the |k8s-op-short| sets
   ``ClusterIP`` to ``None``, and performs these actions:

   - Creates this service if it doesn't exist.
  
   - For ``ReplicaSet`` or ``Standalone`` resources, the |k8s-op-short|
     names the service with the custom resource's name  with ``-svc``
     appended to it.
   - For a ``ShardedCluster`` resource, the |k8s-op-short| uses these
     naming conventions:
  
     - For |mongos| instances, the |k8s-op-short| uses the name specified in
       :setting:`spec.service`, or the resource's name  with ``-svc``
       appended to it.
     - For the config servers, the |k8s-op-short| uses the resource's name
       with ``-cs`` appended to it.
     - For each shard, the |k8s-op-short| uses the resource's name
       with ``-sh`` appended to it.

   - For the port, the |k8s-op-short| uses the default port 27017, or
     the :manual:`.net.port </reference/configuration-options/#net.port>`
     specified in :setting:`spec.additionalMongodConfig`.

.. _mdb-user-resource-reconcile:

Reconciling the ``MongoDBUser`` Custom Resource
-----------------------------------------------

If the user authentication method is set to :ref:`SCRAM
<add-db-user-scram>`,
the ``MongoDBUser`` custom resource depends
on the |k8s-secret| that stores the user credentials. You specify the
secret in the ``spec.passwordSecretKeyRef`` settings in the ``MongoDBUser``
resource specification.

The |k8s-op-short| watches the secret for changes. If you make changes
to the secret's configuration, the |k8s-op-short| reconciles the
changes. It takes the following actions:

1. Determines the MongoDB user's resource based on the value
   specified in the ``spec.MongoDBResourceRef.name`` setting in the
   ``MongoDBUser`` resource specification.

2. Connects to |com|:

   - Reads the organization's name from ``OrgId`` in the ConfigMap, or
     uses the same name for the organization as the project's name in |com|.
   - Reads a project's name from ``projectName`` in the ConfigMap,
     or creates this project in |com| if it doesn't exist.
   - Checks that the ``<project-id>-group-secret`` created by the
     |k8s-op-short| for the {+mdbagent+} exists.
     The |k8s-op-short| reads the secret, or, creates it with
     :opsmgr:`Ops Manager API keys
     </reference/api/agentapikeys/create-one-agent-api-key>`
     or :cloudmgr:`Cloud Manager API keys
     </reference/api/agentapikeys/create-one-agent-api-key>`.
     
3. Updates the user's credentials in |com|, or creates a new user if it doesn't exist.
   
   - If the user authentication method is :ref:`SCRAM <add-db-user-scram>`,
     reads the password from the secret.
   - Reads the user name. If the user name has changed, the |k8s-op-short|
     removes the old name and adds a new one.
   - Ensures that the user exists in |com|.

The following diagram describes how the |k8s-op-short| behaves if you make
changes to the user secret or the ``MongoDBUser``
custom resource specification.
