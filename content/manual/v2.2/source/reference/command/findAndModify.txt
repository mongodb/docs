.. dbcommand:: findAndModify

   The :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command atomically modifies and
   returns a single document. By default, the returned document does
   not include the modifications made on the update. To return the
   document with the modifications made on the update, use the ``new``
   option.

   The command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        findAndModify: <string>,
        query: <document>,
        sort: <document>,
        remove: <boolean>,
        update: <document>,
        new: <boolean>,
        fields: <document>,
        upsert: <boolean>
      }

   The :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command takes the following
   fields:

   :field string findAndModify:

      Required. The collection against which to run the command.

   :field document query:

      Optional. Specifies the selection criteria for the
      modification. The ``query`` field employs the same :ref:`query
      selectors <query-selectors>` as used in the
      :method:`db.collection.find()` method. Although the query may
      match multiple documents, :dbcommand:`findAndModify` will only
      select one document to modify.

   :field document sort:

      Optional. Determines which document the operation will modify if
      the query selects multiple documents. :dbcommand:`findAndModify`
      will modify the first document in the sort order specified by
      this argument.

   :field boolean remove:

      Optional if ``update`` field exists. When ``true``, removes
      the selected document. The default is ``false``.

   :field document update:

      Optional if ``remove`` field exists. Performs an update of the
      selected document. The ``update`` field employs the same
      :ref:`update operators <update-operators>` or ``field: value``
      specifications to modify the selected document.

   :field boolean new:

      Optional. When ``true``, returns the modified document rather
      than the original. The :dbcommand:`findAndModify` method ignores
      the ``new`` option for ``remove`` operations. The default is
      ``false``.

   :field document fields:

      Optional. A subset of fields to return. The ``fields`` document
      specifies an inclusion of a field with ``1``, as in the
      following:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         fields: { <field1>: 1, <field2>: 1, ... }

      See :ref:`projection <read-operations-projection>`.

   :field boolean upsert:

      Optional. Used in conjunction with the ``update`` field. When
      ``true``, the :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command creates a new
      document if the ``query`` returns no documents. The default is
      ``false``.

   The :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command returns a document, similar
   to the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         lastErrorObject: {
                              updatedExisting: <boolean>,
                              upserted: <boolean>,
                              n: <num>,
                              connectionId: <num>,
                              err: <string>,
                              ok: <num>
         }
         value: <document>,
         ok: <num>
      }

   The return document contains the following fields:

   - The ``lastErrorObject`` field that returns the details of the
     command:

     - The ``updatedExisting`` field **only** appears if the command is
       either an ``update`` or an ``upsert``.

     - The ``upserted`` field **only** appears if the command is an
       ``upsert``.

   - The ``value`` field that returns either:

     - the original (i.e. pre-modification) document if ``new`` is
       false, or

     - the modified or inserted document if ``new: true``.

   - The ``ok`` field that returns the status of the command.

   .. note::

      If the :dbcommand:`findAndModify` finds no matching document,
      then:

      - for ``update`` or ``remove`` operations, ``lastErrorObject``
        does not appear in the return document and the ``value`` field
        holds a ``null``.

        .. code-block:: javascript

           { "value" : null, "ok" : 1 }

      - for an ``upsert`` operation that performs an insert, when ``new``
        is ``false``, **and** includes a ``sort`` option, the return
        document has ``lastErrorObject``, ``value``, and ``ok``
        fields, but the ``value`` field holds an empty document
        ``{}``.

      - for an ``upsert`` that performs an insert, when ``new`` is
        ``false`` **without** a specified ``sort`` the return
        document has ``lastErrorObject``, ``value``, and ``ok``
        fields, but the ``value`` field holds a ``null``.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.2
           Previously, the command returned an empty document (e.g.
           ``{}``) in the ``value`` field. See :ref:`the 2.2 release
           notes <2.2-findandmodify-returns-null>` for more information.

   Consider the following examples:

   - The following command updates an existing document in the
     ``people`` collection where the document matches the ``query``
     criteria:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.runCommand(
                        {
                          findAndModify: "people",
                          query: { name: "Tom", state: "active", rating: { $gt: 10 } },
                          sort: { rating: 1 },
                          update: { $inc: { score: 1 } }
                        }
                     )

     This command performs the following actions:

     #. The ``query`` finds a document in the ``people`` collection where the
        ``name`` field has the value ``Tom``, the ``state`` field has
        the value ``active`` and the ``rating`` field has a value
        :operator:`greater than <$gt>` 10.

     #. The ``sort`` orders the results of the query in ascending order.
        If multiple documents meet the ``query`` condition, the command
        will select for modification the first document as ordered by
        this ``sort``.

     #. The ``update`` :operator:`increments <$inc>` the value of the
        ``score`` field by 1.

     #. The command returns a document with the following fields:

        - The ``lastErrorObject`` field that contains the details of
          the command, including the field ``updatedExisting`` which is
          ``true``, and

        - The ``value`` field that contains the original (i.e.
          pre-modification) document selected for this update:

        .. code-block:: javascript

           {
             "lastErrorObject" : {
                "updatedExisting" : true,
                "n" : 1,
                "connectionId" : 1,
                "err" : null,
                "ok" : 1
             },
             "value" : {
                "_id" : ObjectId("50f1d54e9beb36a0f45c6452"),
                "name" : "Tom",
                "state" : "active",
                "rating" : 100,
                "score" : 5
             },
             "ok" : 1
           }

        To return the modified document in the ``value`` field, add the
        ``new:true`` option to the command.

        If no document match the ``query`` condition, the command
        returns a document that contains ``null`` in the ``value``
        field:

        .. code-block:: javascript

           { "value" : null, "ok" : 1 }

     The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and many :term:`drivers <driver>`
     provide a :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` helper method.
     Using the shell helper, this previous operation can take the
     following form:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.people.findAndModify( {
           query: { name: "Tom", state: "active", rating: { $gt: 10 } },
           sort: { rating: 1 },
           update: { $inc: { score: 1 } }
        } );

     However, the :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()` shell helper
     method returns just the unmodified document, or the modified
     document when ``new`` is ``true``.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {
           "_id" : ObjectId("50f1d54e9beb36a0f45c6452"),
           "name" : "Tom",
           "state" : "active",
           "rating" : 100,
           "score" : 5
        }

   - The following :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command includes the
     ``upsert: true`` option to insert a new document if no document
     matches the ``query`` condition:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.runCommand(
                       {
                         findAndModify: "people",
                         query: { name: "Gus", state: "active", rating: 100 },
                         sort: { rating: 1 },
                         update: { $inc: { score: 1 } },
                         upsert: true
                       }
                     )

     If the command does **not** find a matching document, the command
     performs an upsert and returns a document with the following
     fields:

     - The ``lastErrorObject`` field that contains the details of the
       command, including the field ``upserted`` that contains the
       ``ObjectId`` of the newly inserted document, and

     - The ``value`` field that contains an empty document ``{}`` as
       the original document because the command included the ``sort``
       option:

     .. code-block:: sh

        {
          "lastErrorObject" : {
             "updatedExisting" : false,
             "upserted" : ObjectId("50f2329d0092b46dae1dc98e"),
             "n" : 1,
             "connectionId" : 1,
             "err" : null,
             "ok" : 1
          },
          "value" : {

          },
          "ok" : 1
        }

     If the command did **not** include the ``sort`` option, the ``value`` field
     would contain ``null``:

     .. code-block:: sh

        {
          "value" : null,
          "lastErrorObject" : {
             "updatedExisting" : false,
             "n" : 1,
             "upserted" : ObjectId("5102f7540cb5c8be998c2e99")
          },
          "ok" : 1
        }

   - The following :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command includes both
     ``upsert: true`` option and the ``new:true`` option to return the
     newly inserted document in the ``value`` field if a document
     matching the ``query`` is not found:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.runCommand(
                       {
                         findAndModify: "people",
                         query: { name: "Pascal", state: "active", rating: 25 },
                         sort: { rating: 1 },
                         update: { $inc: { score: 1 } },
                         upsert: true,
                         new: true
                       }
                     )

     The command returns the newly inserted document in the ``value``
     field:

     .. code-block:: sh

        {
          "lastErrorObject" : {
             "updatedExisting" : false,
             "upserted" : ObjectId("50f47909444c11ac2448a5ce"),
             "n" : 1,
             "connectionId" : 1,
             "err" : null,
             "ok" : 1
          },
          "value" : {
             "_id" : ObjectId("50f47909444c11ac2448a5ce"),
             "name" : "Pascal",
             "rating" : 25,
             "score" : 1,
             "state" : "active"
          },
          "ok" : 1
        }

   When the :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command includes the ``upsert:
   true`` option **and** the query field(s) is not uniquely indexed, the
   method could insert a document multiple times in certain
   circumstances. For instance, if multiple clients issue the
   :dbcommand:`findAndModify` command and these commands complete the
   ``find`` phase before any one starts the ``modify`` phase, these
   commands could insert the same document.

   Consider an example where no document with the name ``Andy`` exists
   and multiple clients issue the following command:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand(
                     {
                       findAndModify: "people",
                       query: { name: "Andy" },
                       sort: { rating: 1 },
                       update: { $inc: { score: 1 } },
                       upsert: true
                     }
                   )

   If all the commands finish the ``query`` phase before any command
   starts the ``modify`` phase, **and** there is no unique index on the
   ``name`` field, the commands may all perform an upsert. To prevent
   this condition, create a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>` on
   the ``name`` field. With the unique index in place, then the multiple
   :dbcommand:`findAndModify` commands would observe one of the
   following behaviors:

   - Exactly one :dbcommand:`findAndModify` would successfully insert a
     new document.

   - Zero or more :dbcommand:`findAndModify` commands would update the
     newly inserted document.

   - Zero or more :dbcommand:`findAndModify` commands would fail when
     they attempted to insert a duplicate. If the command fails due to
     a unique index constraint violation, you can retry the command.
     Absent a delete of the document, the retry should not fail.

   .. warning::

      When using :dbcommand:`findAndModify` in a :term:`sharded
      <sharding>` environment, the ``query`` must contain the
      :term:`shard key` for all operations against the shard
      cluster. :dbcommand:`findAndModify` operations issued against
      :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances for non-sharded collections function
      normally.

   .. note::

      This command obtains a write lock on the affected database and
      will block other operations until it has completed; however,
      typically the write lock is short lived and equivalent to other
      similar :method:`update() <db.collection.update()>` operations.
