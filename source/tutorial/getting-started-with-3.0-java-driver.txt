Getting Started with the 3.0 Java Driver (Release Candidate)
===============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Introduction
-------------

This page is a brief overview of working with the 3.0 MongoDB Java Driver.

.. note::
   The 3.0 Java driver is currently in beta. We are looking for
   feedback, but please do not use it in production deployments yet.

For more information about the Java API, please refer to the `online API Documentation for 3.0 Java Driver`_.

.. _`online API Documentation for 3.0 Java Driver`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/3.0/index.html

A Quick Tour
------------

See the `Binaries section of the README <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/tree/master#binaries>`_
for instructions on how to include the driver in your project.

.. note::
   The following code snippets come from the :file:`QuickTour.java`
   example code that can be found with the
   `driver source <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/blob/3.0.x/driver/src/examples/tour/QuickTour.java>`_.

Making a Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make a connection to a MongoDB, you need to have at the minimum, the
name of a database to connect to. The database doesn't have to exist -
if it doesn't, MongoDB will create it for you.

Additionally, you can specify the server address and port when
connecting. The following example shows three ways to connect to the
database ``mydb`` on the local machine :

.. code-block:: java

   // To directly connect to a single MongoDB server (note that this will not auto-discover the primary even
   // if it's a member of a replica set:
   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient();
   // or
   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient( "localhost" );
   // or
   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient( "localhost" , 27017 );
   // or, to connect to a replica set, with auto-discovery of the primary, supply a seed list of members
   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(Arrays.asList(new ServerAddress("localhost", 27017),
                                         new ServerAddress("localhost", 27018),
                                         new ServerAddress("localhost", 27019)));
   // or use a connection string
   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(new MongoClientURI("mongodb://localhost:27017,localhost:27018,localhost:27019"));

   MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("mydb");

At this point, the ``database`` object will be a connection to a MongoDB server
for the specified database. With it, you can do further operations.

.. note::

   The ``MongoClient`` instance actually represents a pool of
   connections to the database; you will only need one instance of
   class ``MongoClient`` even with multiple threads. See the
   :ref:`concurrency <java-driver-concurrency>` doc page for more
   information.

The ``MongoClient`` class is designed to be thread safe and shared
among threads. Typically you create only 1 instance for a given
database cluster and use it across your application. If for some reason
you decide to create many ``MongoClient`` instances, note that:

- all resource usage limits (max connections, etc) apply per
  ``MongoClient`` instance

- to dispose of an instance, make sure you call ``MongoClient.close()`` to
  clean up resources

.. _`MongoClient`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/3.0/com/mongodb/MongoClient.html

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB can be run in a secure mode where access to databases is
controlled via authentication. When run in this mode, any client application
must provide a list of credentials which will be used to authenticate against.
In the Java driver, you simply provide the credentials when creating a
``MongoClient`` instance:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoCredential credential = MongoCredential.createCredential(userName, database, password);
   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(new ServerAddress(), Arrays.asList(credential));

or in the connection string:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(new MongoClientURI("mongodb://user:pwd@localhost"));

MongoDB supports various different authentication mechanisms. See the `access control tutorials`_ for more information.

.. _`access control tutorials`: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/administration/security-access-control

MONGODB-X509 Authentication
---------------------------

The MONGODB-X509 mechanism authenticates a user whose name is derived from the distinguished subject name of the X.509 certificate presented by the driver during SSL negotiation.
This authentication method requires the use of SSL connections with certificate validation and is available in MongoDB 2.6 and newer:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoCredential credential = MongoCredential.createMongoX509Credential("<X.509 derived username>");

   MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(new ServerAddress(server), Arrays.asList(credential), MongoClientOptions.builder().sslEnabled(true).build());


Getting a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get a collection to use, just specify the name of the collection to
the `getCollection(String collectionName)`_ method:

.. code-block:: java

   MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("test");

Once you have this collection object, you can now do things like insert data, query for data, etc.

.. _`getCollection(String collectionName)`:
   http://api.mongodb.org/java/3.0/com/mongodb/client/MongoDatabase.html#getCollection-java.lang.String-

Inserting a Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have the collection object, you can insert documents into the
collection. For example, lets make a little document that in JSON would
be represented as

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "name" : "MongoDB",
      "type" : "database",
      "count" : 1,
      "info" : {
                  x : 203,
                  y : 102
                }
   }

Notice that the above has an "inner" document embedded within it. To do
this, we can use the `Document`_ class to create the document
(including the inner document), and then just simply insert it into the
collection using the ``insertOne()`` method.

.. code-block:: java

    Document doc = new Document("name", "MongoDB")
                   .append("type", "database")
                   .append("count", 1)
                   .append("info", new Document("x", 203).append("y", 102));
    collection.insertOne(doc);

.. _`Document`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/3.0/org/bson/Document.html

Finding the First Document in a Collection Using ``find()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To show that the document we inserted in the previous step is there, we
can do a simple `find()`_ operation followed by a call to `first()`_ to get the first document in the
collection. This method returns a single document, and it's useful for queries which should only
match a single document, or you are only interested in the first. You don't have to deal with the cursor.

.. code-block:: java

        Document myDoc = collection.find().first();
        System.out.println(myDoc);

and you should see

.. code-block:: none

   Document{{_id=54b5594843bb7b25f1c9da72, name=MongoDB, type=database, count=1, info=Document{{x=203, y=102}}}}

.. note::
   The ``_id`` element has been added automatically by MongoDB to your
   document. Remember, MongoDB reserves element names that start with
   "_" and "$" for internal use.

.. _`find()`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/3.0/com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html#find--

.. _`first()`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/3.0/com/mongodb/client/MongoIterable.html#first--

Adding Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to do more interesting things with queries, let's add multiple
simple documents to the collection. These documents will just be

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "i" : value
   }

and we can do this fairly efficiently in a loop

.. code-block:: java

       List<Document> documents = new ArrayList<Document>();
       for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
           documents.add(new Document("i", i));
       }
       collection.insertMany(documents);


Counting Documents in A Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we've inserted 101 documents (the 100 we did in the loop, plus
the first one), we can check to see if we have them all using the
`count()`_ method.

.. code-block:: java

   System.out.println(collection.count());

and it should print ``101``.

.. _`count()`: http://api.mongodb.org/java/3.0/com/mongodb/client/MongoCollection.html#count--

Using a Cursor to Get All the Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to get all the documents in the collection, we will use the
``find()`` method. The ``find()`` method returns a ``MongoIterable`` instance which allows
us to iterate over the set of documents that matched our query. So to
query all of the documents and print them out :

.. code-block:: java

        MongoCursor<Document> cursor = collection.find().iterator();
        try {
            while (cursor.hasNext()) {
                System.out.println(cursor.next());
            }
        } finally {
            cursor.close();
        }

and that should print all 101 documents in the collection.

Note that while this idiom is permissible:

.. code-block:: java

        for (Document cur : collection.find()) {
            System.out.println(cur);
        }

its use is discouraged as the application can leak a cursor if the loop terminates early.

Getting A Single Document with A Query Filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can create a filter to pass to the find() method to get a subset of
the documents in our collection. For example, if we wanted to find the
document for which the value of the "i" field is 71, we would do the
following ;

.. code-block:: java

        myDoc = collection.find(eq("i", 71)).first();
        System.out.println(myDoc);

and it should just print just one document

.. code-block:: none

    Document{{_id=54b5629643bb7b2a52e19ea3, i=71}}

Note that this usage relies on a static import of the Filters.eq method:

.. code-block:: java

    import static com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.*;

Getting A Set of Documents With a Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can use the query to get a set of documents from our collection.
For example, if we wanted to get all documents where ``"i" > 50``, we could
write:

.. code-block:: java

        // now use a range query to get a larger subset
        cursor = collection.find(gt("i", 50)).iterator();

        try {
            while (cursor.hasNext()) {
                System.out.println(cursor.next());
            }
        } finally {
            cursor.close();
        }

which should print the documents where ``i > 50``.

We could also get a range, say ``50 < i <= 100``:

.. code-block:: java

        cursor = collection.find(and(gt("i", 50), lte("i", 100))).iterator();

        try {
            while (cursor.hasNext()) {
                System.out.println(cursor.next());
            }
        } finally {
            cursor.close();
        }

MaxTime
~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.6 introduced the ability to timeout individual queries:

.. code-block:: java

        collection.find().maxTime(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS).first();

In the example above the maxTime is set to one second and the query will be
aborted after the full second is up.

Bulk operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the covers MongoDB is moving away from the combination of a write
operation followed by get last error (GLE) and towards a write commands API. These new
commands allow for the execution of bulk insert/update/delete operations.
There are two types of bulk operations:

1. Ordered bulk operations.
    Executes all the operation in order and error out on the first write error.
2. Unordered bulk operations.
    These operations execute all the operations in parallel and aggregates up
    all the errors. Unordered bulk operations do not guarantee order of execution.

Let's look at two simple examples using ordered and unordered operations:

.. code-block:: java

       // 2. Orrdered bulk operation - order is guarenteed
         collection.bulkWrite(Arrays.asList(new InsertOneModel<Document>(new Document("_id", 4)),
                                           new InsertOneModel<Document>(new Document("_id", 5)),
                                           new InsertOneModel<Document>(new Document("_id", 6)),
                                           new UpdateOneModel<Document>(new Document("_id", 1),
                                                                        new Document("$set", new Document("x", 2))),
                                           new DeleteOneModel<Document>(new Document("_id", 2)),
                                           new ReplaceOneModel<Document>(new Document("_id", 3),
                                                                         new Document("_id", 3).append("x", 4))));


        // 2. Unordered bulk operation - no guarantee of order of operation
        collection.bulkWrite(Arrays.asList(new InsertOneModel<Document>(new Document("_id", 4)),
                                           new InsertOneModel<Document>(new Document("_id", 5)),
                                           new InsertOneModel<Document>(new Document("_id", 6)),
                                           new UpdateOneModel<Document>(new Document("_id", 1),
                                                                        new Document("$set", new Document("x", 2))),
                                           new DeleteOneModel<Document>(new Document("_id", 2)),
                                           new ReplaceOneModel<Document>(new Document("_id", 3),
                                                                         new Document("_id", 3).append("x", 4))),
                             new BulkWriteOptions().ordered(false));

.. note::
   For servers older than 2.6 the API will down convert the operations, and
   support the correct semantics for BulkWriteResult and BulkWriteException each write
   operation has to be done one at a time. It's not possible to down convert
   100% so there might be slight edge cases where it cannot correctly report
   the right numbers.

Quick Tour of the Administrative Functions
------------------------------------------

Getting A List of Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get a list of the available databases:

.. code-block:: java

        for (String name: mongoClient.listDatabaseNames()) {
            System.out.println(name);
        }

Calling the ``getDatabase()`` on ``MongoClient`` does not create a database. Only when a database
is written to will a database be created.  Examples would be creating an index
or collection or inserting a document into a collection.

Dropping A Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can drop a database by name using a ``MongoClient`` instance:

.. code-block:: java

   mongoClient.dropDatabase("databaseToBeDropped");

Creating A Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to create a collection. Inserting a document will create the
collection if it doesn't exist or calling the `createCollection <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/db.createCollection>`_ command.

An example of creating a `capped collection`_ sized to 1 megabyte:

.. code-block:: java

        database.createCollection("cappedCollection", new CreateCollectionOptions().capped(true).sizeInBytes(0x100000));

.. _`capped collection` : http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/capped-collections/

Getting A List of Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get a list of the available collections in a database:

.. code-block:: java

        for (String name : database.listCollectionNames()) {
            System.out.println(name);
        }

Dropping A Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can drop a collection by using the `drop()` method:

.. code-block:: java

       collection.dropCollection();

And you should notice that the collection no longer exists.

Creating An Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports indexes, and they are very easy to add on a
collection. To create an index, you just specify the field that should
be indexed, and specify if you want the index to be ascending (``1``)
or descending (``-1``). The following creates an ascending index on the
``i`` field :

.. code-block:: java

       // create an ascending index on the "i" field
        collection.createIndex(new Document("i", 1));

Getting a List of Indexes on a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can get a list of the indexes on a collection:

.. code-block:: java

        for (final Document index : collection.listIndexes()) {
            System.out.println(index);
        }

and you should see something like

.. code-block:: none

   Document{{v=1, key=Document{{_id=1}}, name=_id_, ns=mydb.test}}
   Document{{v=1, key=Document{{i=1}}, name=i_1, ns=mydb.test}}

Text indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB also provides text indexes to support text search of string content.
Text indexes can include any field whose value is a string or an array of
string elements. To create a text index specify the string literal "text" in
the index document:

.. code-block:: java

   // create a text index on the "content" field
   coll.createIndex(new BasicDBObject("content", "text"));

As of MongoDB 2.6 text indexes are now integrated into the main query language
and enabled by default:

.. code-block:: java

        // Insert some documents
        collection.insertOne(new Document("_id", 0).append("content", "textual content"));
        collection.insertOne(new Document("_id", 1).append("content", "additional content"));
        collection.insertOne(new Document("_id", 2).append("content", "irrelevant content"));

        // Find using the text index
        Document search = new Document("$search", "textual content -irrelevant");
        Document textSearch = new Document("$text", search);
        long matchCount = collection.count(textSearch);
        System.out.println("Text search matches: "+ matchCount);

        // Find using the $language operator
        textSearch = new Document("$text", search.append("$language", "english"));
        matchCount = collection.count(textSearch);
        System.out.println("Text search matches (english): "+ matchCount);

        // Find the highest scoring match
        Document projection = new Document("score", new Document("$meta", "textScore"));
        myDoc = collection.find(textSearch).projection(projection).first();
        System.out.println("Highest scoring document: "+ myDoc);


and it should print:

.. code-block:: none

    Text search matches: 2
    Text search matches (english): 2
    Highest scoring document: Document{{_id=1, content=additional content, score=0.75}}

For more information about text search see the
:manual:`text index </core/index-text>` and
:manual:`$text query operator </reference/operator/query/text>`
documentation.
