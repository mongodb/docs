.. pipeline:: $geoNear

   Outputs documents in order of nearest to farthest from a specified
   point.

   The :pipeline:`$geoNear` stage has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $geoNear: { <geoNear options> } }

   The :pipeline:`$geoNear` operator accepts a :term:`document` that
   contains the following :pipeline:`$geoNear` options. Specify all
   distances in the same units as those of the processed documents'
   coordinate system:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - ``spherical``
   
        - boolean
   
        - Determines how MongoDB calculates the distance between two points: 
          
          - When ``true``, MongoDB uses :query:`$nearSphere` semantics and
            calculates distances using spherical geometry.
          
          - When ``false``, MongoDB uses :query:`$near` semantics:
            spherical geometry for :doc:`2dsphere </core/2dsphere>`
            indexes and planar geometry for :doc:`2d </core/2d>` indexes.
          
          *Default: false.*
          
          
   
      * - ``limit``
   
        - number
   
        - Optional. The maximum number of documents to return. The default value is ``100``.
          See also the ``num`` option.
          
          
   
      * - ``num``
   
        - number
   
        - Optional. The ``num`` option provides the same function as the ``limit`` option.
          Both define the maximum number of documents to return. If both options
          are included, the ``num`` value overrides the ``limit`` value.
          
          
   
      * - ``maxDistance``
   
        - number
   
        - Optional. The maximum distance from the center point that the documents *can*
          be. MongoDB limits the results to those documents that fall within
          the specified distance from the center point.
          
          Specify the distance in meters if the specified point is
          :term:`GeoJSON` and in radians if the specified point is
          :term:`legacy coordinate pairs <legacy coordinate pairs>`.
          
          
   
      * - ``query``
   
        - document
   
        - Optional. Limits the results to the documents that match the query. The query
          syntax is the usual MongoDB :ref:`read operation query
          <read-operations-query-argument>` syntax.
          
          .. include:: /includes/fact-geoNear-restrict-near-in-query.rst
          
          
   
      * - ``distanceMultiplier``
   
        - number
   
        - Optional. The factor to multiply all distances returned by the query. For
          example, use the ``distanceMultiplier`` to convert radians, as
          returned by a spherical query, to kilometers by multiplying by the
          radius of the Earth.
          
          
   
      * - ``uniqueDocs``
   
        - boolean
   
        - Optional. If this value is ``true``, the query returns a matching document once,
          even if more than one of the document's location fields match the
          query.
          
          .. include:: /includes/deprecation-uniqueDocs.rst
          
          
   
      * - ``near``
   
        - GeoJSON point or :term:`legacy coordinate pair <legacy coordinate pairs>`
   
        - The point for which to find the closest documents.
          
          If using a :doc:`2dsphere </core/2dsphere>` index, you can specify
          the point as either a GeoJSON point or legacy coordinate pair.
          
          If using a :doc:`2d </core/2d>` index, specify the point as a legacy
          coordinate pair.
          
          
   
      * - ``distanceField``
   
        - string
   
        - The output field that contains the
          calculated distance. To specify a field within an embedded document,
          use :term:`dot notation`.
          
          
   
      * - ``includeLocs``
   
        - string
   
        - Optional. This specifies the output field that identifies the location used to
          calculate the distance. This option is useful when a location field
          contains multiple locations. To specify a field within an
          embedded document, use :term:`dot notation`.
          
          
   
      * - ``minDistance``
   
        - number
   
        - Optional. The minimum distance from the center point that the documents can
          be. MongoDB limits the results to those documents that fall outside
          the specified distance from the center point.
          
          Specify the distance in meters for GeoJSON data and in radians for
          legacy coordinate pairs.
          
          .. versionadded:: 3.2
          
          
   
      * - ``key``
   
        - string
   
        - Optional. Specify the geospatial indexed field to use when calculating the distance.
          
          If your collection has multiple ``2d`` and/or multiple
          ``2dsphere`` indexes, you **must** use the ``key`` option to specify
          the indexed field path to use. :ref:`pipeline-geoNear-key-param-example` provides a full example.
          
          If there is more than one ``2d`` index or more than one ``2dsphere``
          index and you do not specify a ``key``, MongoDB will return an error.
          
          If you do not specify the ``key``, and you have at most only one
          ``2d`` index and/or only one ``2dsphere`` index, MongoDB looks first
          for a ``2d`` index to use. If a ``2d`` index does not exists, then
          MongoDB looks for a ``2dsphere`` index to use.

Behavior
--------

When using :pipeline:`$geoNear`, consider that:

- You can only use :pipeline:`$geoNear` as the first stage of a
  pipeline.

- You must include the ``distanceField`` option. The
  ``distanceField`` option specifies the field that will contain
  the calculated distance.

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/geoNear-stage-index-requirement.rst
  If you have more than one geospatial index on the collection, use the
  ``keys`` parameter to specify which field to use in the calculation.
  If you have only one geospatial index, :pipeline:`$geoNear` implicitly
  uses the indexed field for the calculation.

.. |geoNear| replace:: :pipeline:`$geoNear` stage

- .. include:: /includes/fact-geoNear-restrict-near-in-query.rst

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/views-unsupported-geoNear.rst

Generally, the options for :pipeline:`$geoNear` are similar to the
deprecated :dbcommand:`geoNear` command with the following exceptions:

- ``distanceField`` is a mandatory field for the
  :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline operator; the option does not exist
  in the :dbcommand:`geoNear` command.

- ``includeLocs`` accepts a ``string`` in the :pipeline:`$geoNear`
  pipeline operator and a ``boolean`` in the :dbcommand:`geoNear`
  command.

Examples
--------

.. include:: /includes/geospatial-places-data-setup.rst

Maximum Distance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``places`` collection above has a ``2dsphere`` index.
The following aggregation uses :pipeline:`$geoNear` to find documents 
with a location at most 2 meters from the center 
``[ -73.99279 , 40.719296 ]`` and ``category`` equal to ``Parks``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.aggregate([
      {
        $geoNear: {
           near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.99279 , 40.719296 ] },
           distanceField: "dist.calculated",
           maxDistance: 2,
           query: { type: "public" },
           includeLocs: "dist.location",
           num: 5,
           spherical: true
        }
      }
   ])

The aggregation returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : 8,
      "name" : "Sara D. Roosevelt Park",
      "type" : "public",
      "location" : {
         "type" : "Point",
         "coordinates" : [ -73.9928, 40.7193 ]
      },
      "dist" : {
         "calculated" : 0.9539931676365992,
         "location" : {
            "type" : "Point",
            "coordinates" : [ -73.9928, 40.7193 ]
         }
      }
   }

The matching document contains two new fields:

- ``dist.calculated`` field that contains the calculated distance, and

- ``dist.location`` field that contains the location used in the
  calculation.

Minimum Distance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.2

The following example uses the option ``minDistance`` to specify
the minimum distance from the center point that the documents can be.
MongoDB limits the results to those documents that fall outside the
specified distance from the center point.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.aggregate([ 
      {
        $geoNear: {
           near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.99279 , 40.719296 ] },
           distanceField: "dist.calculated",
           minDistance: 2,
           query: { type: "public" },
           includeLocs: "dist.location",
           num: 5,
           spherical: true
        }
      }
   ])

.. _pipeline-geoNear-key-param-example:

Specify Which Geospatial Index to Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 4.0

Consider a ``places`` collection that has a :doc:`2dsphere
</core/2dsphere>` index on the ``location`` field and a
:doc:`2d </core/2d>` index on the ``legacy`` field.

A document in the ``places`` collection resembles the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : 3,
      "name" : "Polo Grounds",
      "location": {
         "type" : "Point",
         "coordinates" : [ -73.9375, 40.8303 ]
      },
      "legacy" : [ -73.9375, 40.8303 ],
      "category" : "Stadiums"
   }

The following example uses the ``keys`` option to specify that the
aggregation should use the ``location`` field values for the
:pipeline:`$geoNear` operation rather than the ``legacy`` field values.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.aggregate([
      {
        $geoNear: {
           near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.98142 , 40.71782 ] },
           key: "location",
           distanceField: "dist.calculated",
           query: { "category": "Parks" }
        }
      }
   ])

The aggregation returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : 2,
      "name" : "Sara D. Roosevelt Park",
      "location" : {
         "type" : "Point",
         "coordinates" : [
            -73.9928,
            40.7193
         ]
      },
      "category" : "Parks",
      "dist" : {
         "calculated" : 974.175764916902
      }
   }
   {
      "_id" : 1,
      "name" : "Central Park",
      "location" : {
         "type" : "Point",
         "coordinates" : [
            -73.97,
            40.77
         ]
      },
      "legacy" : [
         -73.97,
         40.77
      ],
      "category" : "Parks",
      "dist" : {
         "calculated" : 5887.92792958097
      }
   }
