Install MongoDB on Red Hat Enterprise, CentOS, or Fedora
========================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This tutorial outlines the steps to install :term:`MongoDB` on
Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS Linux, Fedora Linux and related
systems. The tutorial uses ``.rpm`` packages to install. While some of
these distributions include their own MongoDB packages, the official
MongoDB packages are generally more up to date.

Packages
--------

The MongoDB downloads repository contains two packages:

- ``mongo-10gen-server``

  This package contains the :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`
  daemons from the latest **stable** release and associated
  configuration and init scripts. Additionally, you can use this
  package to :ref:`install daemons from a previous release
  <install-rhel-version-pinning>` of MongoDB.

- ``mongo-10gen``

  This package contains all MongoDB tools from the latest **stable**
  release. Additionally, you can use this package to :ref:`install
  tools from a previous release <install-rhel-version-pinning>` of
  MongoDB.  Install this package on all production MongoDB hosts and
  optionally on other systems from which you may need to administer
  MongoDB systems.

Install MongoDB
---------------

Configure Package Management System (YUM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a ``/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb.repo`` file to hold the
following configuration information for the MongoDB repository:

.. tip:: For production deployments, always run MongoDB on 64-bit
   systems.

If you are running a 64-bit system, use the following configuration:

.. code-block:: cfg

   [mongodb]
   name=MongoDB Repository
   baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/x86_64/
   gpgcheck=0
   enabled=1

If you are running a 32-bit system, which is not recommended for
production deployments, use the following configuration:

.. code-block:: cfg

   [mongodb]
   name=MongoDB Repository
   baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/i686/
   gpgcheck=0
   enabled=1

Install Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issue the following command (as ``root`` or with ``sudo``) to install
the latest stable version of MongoDB and the associated tools:

.. code-block:: sh

   yum install mongo-10gen mongo-10gen-server

When this command completes, you have successfully installed MongoDB!

.. _install-rhel-version-pinning:

Manage Installed Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``mongo-10gen`` and ``mongo-10gen-server`` packages to
install previous releases of MongoDB. To install a specific release, append the
version number, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   yum install mongo-10gen-2.2.3 mongo-10gen-server-2.2.3

This installs the ``mongo-10gen`` and ``mongo-10gen-server`` packages
with the ``2.2.3`` release. You can specify any available version of
MongoDB; however ``yum`` **will** upgrade the ``mongo-10gen`` and
``mongo-10gen-server`` packages when a newer version becomes
available. Use the following *pinning* procedure to prevent unintended
upgrades.

To pin a package, add the following line to your ``/etc/yum.conf``
file:

.. code-block:: ini

   exclude=mongo-10gen,mongo-10gen-server

Control Scripts
---------------

.. warning::

   With the introduction of ``systemd`` in Fedora 15, the control
   scripts included in the packages available in the MongoDB downloads repository
   are not compatible with Fedora systems. A correction is
   forthcoming, see :issue:`SERVER-7285` for more information, and in
   the mean time use your own control scripts *or* install using the
   procedure outlined in :doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-linux`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-unix-control-scripts.rst

Run MongoDB
-----------

.. important:: You must configure SELinux to allow MongoDB to start on Fedora systems.
   Administrators have two options:

   - enable access to the relevant ports (e.g. 27017) for SELinux. See
     :ref:`security-port-numbers` for more information on MongoDB's
     :doc:`default ports </reference/default-mongodb-port>`.

   - disable SELinux entirely. This requires a system reboot and may have
     larger implications for your deployment.

Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-unix-data-and-log-dir.rst

Start the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the following command
(as root or with ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: sh

   service mongod start

You can verify that the :program:`mongod` process has started
successfully by checking the contents of the log file at
``/var/log/mongo/mongod.log``.

You may optionally ensure that MongoDB will start following a system
reboot by issuing the following command (with root privileges:)

.. code-block:: sh

   chkconfig mongod on

Stop MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stop the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the following command
(as root or with ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: sh

   service mongod stop

Restart MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can restart the :program:`mongod` process by issuing the following
command (as root or with ``sudo``):

.. code-block:: sh

   service mongod restart

Follow the state of this process by watching the output in the
``/var/log/mongo/mongod.log`` file to watch for errors or important
messages from the server.
