|mms| provides several tools to help analyze slow queries
executed on your clusters. See the following sections for descriptions 
of each tool. To optimize your query performance, 
:ref:`review the best practices for query performance 
<query-best-practices>`.

Performance Advisor
-------------------

The :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` monitors slow 
queries and suggests new indexes to improve query performance.

You can use the Performance Advisor to review the following information:

- :ref:`Index Ranking <pa-index-ranking>`
- :ref:`Drop Index Recommendations <pa-drop-index>`

Query Insights
--------------

Monitor collection-level :manual:`query latency </reference/operator/aggregation/collStats/#latencystats-document>` with 
:ref:`Query Insights <query-insights>`. You can view query 
latency metrics and statistics for certain hosts and operation types. 
Manage pinned namespaces and choose up to five namespaces to show in 
the corresponding query latency charts.

Profiler
--------

The :ref:`Profiler <profile-databases>` displays slow-running 
operations and their key performance statistics. You can explore a 
sample of historical queries for up to the last 24 hours without 
additional performance overhead. Before you enable the 
Profiler, see :ref:`Considerations <considerations-profile-database>`.

Best Practices for Query Performance
------------------------------------

To optimize query performance, review the following best practices:

- Create queries that your current indexes support to reduce the time 
  needed to search for your results.
  
- Avoid creating documents with large array fields that require a lot 
  of processing to search and index.

- Optimize your indexes and remove unused or inefficent indexes. Too 
  many indexes can negatively affect write performance.

- Consider the suggested indexes from the :ref:`Performance Advisor 
  <performance-advisor>` with the highest :guilabel:`Impact` scores and 
  lowest :guilabel:`Average Query Targeting` scores.

- Create the indexes that the Performance Advisor suggests when they 
  align with your :manual:`Indexing Strategies 
  </applications/indexes/>`.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-performance-advisor-timestamp.rst

- Perform :manual:`rolling index builds
  </tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets/#rolling-index-builds-on-replica-sets>`
  to reduce the performance impact of building indexes on 
  :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` and :term:`sharded clusters 
  <sharded cluster>`.

- :ref:`Drop unused, redundant, and hidden indexes <pa-drop-index>` to 
  improve write performance and free storage space.
