Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to use the {+driver-short+} to monitor server
discovery and monitoring (SDAM) events in a MongoDB instance, replica
set, or sharded cluster. These events occur when there are any changes
in the state of the MongoDB instance or cluster that you are connected
to.

The {+driver-short+} defines nine SDAM events and provides the following
listener interfaces, which listen for three SDAM events each:

- ``ClusterListener``: Listens for events related to topology changes,
  or changes in the state and structure of the cluster
- ``ServerListener``: Listens for events related to individual server
  changes
- ``ServerMonitorListener``: Listens for heartbeat-related events, or
  reports on the status of communication between replica set members

You can use information about SDAM events in your application to
understand cluster changes, assess cluster health, or perform capacity
planning.

.. _scala-subscribe-sdam:

Subscribe to Events
-------------------

You can access details about SDAM events by subscribing to them
in your application. To subscribe to an event, create a class that
implements the ``ClusterListener``, ``ServerListener``, or
``ServerMonitorListener`` interface. Then, add the listener to your
client by configuring an instance of ``MongoClientSettings`` and passing
it to the ``MongoClient`` constructor.

The following code creates the ``TestClusterListener`` class, which implements
the ``ClusterListener`` interface. The class contains the following methods
to handle topology-related events:

- ``clusterOpening()``: Prints a message when the driver first connects to a cluster
- ``clusterClosed()``: Prints a message when the driver disconnects from a cluster
- ``clusterDescriptionChanged()``: Prints a message about changes to the read
  and write availability of the cluster

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring/sdam.scala
   :start-after: start-listener-class
   :end-before: end-listener-class
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Then, subscribe to the ``TestClusterListener`` class by configuring settings
for your ``MongoClient`` instance, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring/sdam.scala
   :start-after: start-configure-client
   :end-before: end-configure-client
   :language: scala
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

When you run the application, your subscriber records the SDAM event and
outputs messages such as the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Cluster with ID ClusterId{value='...', description='...'} opening
   Writable server available
   Readable server available
   Cluster with ID ClusterId{value='...', description='...'} closed

Event Descriptions
------------------

You can subscribe to SDAM events by defining a class that implements
the event's corresponding listener interface and includes a method 
to process the event. The following table provides the name of each SDAM event,
the listener interface that handles the event, and a description of when
the event is published:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Event Type
     - Listener Interface
     - Description

   * - `ClusterDescriptionChangedEvent <{+core-api+}/event/ClusterDescriptionChangedEvent.html>`__
     - `ClusterListener <{+core-api+}/event/ClusterListener.html>`__
     - Created when the topology description changes, such as when there
       is an election of a new primary.

   * - `ClusterOpeningEvent <{+core-api+}/event/ClusterOpeningEvent.html>`__
     - `ClusterListener <{+core-api+}/event/ClusterListener.html>`__
     - Created when the driver first connects to the cluster.

   * - `ClusterClosedEvent <{+core-api+}/event/ClusterClosedEvent.html>`__
     - `ClusterListener <{+core-api+}/event/ClusterListener.html>`__
     - Created when the driver disconnects from the cluster.

   * - `ServerDescriptionChangedEvent <{+core-api+}/event/ServerDescriptionChangedEvent.html>`__
     - `ServerListener <{+core-api+}/event/ServerListener.html>`__
     - Created when the server description changes.

   * - `ServerOpeningEvent <{+core-api+}/event/ServerOpeningEvent.html>`__
     - `ServerListener <{+core-api+}/event/ServerListener.html>`__
     - Created when a new server is added to the topology.

   * - `ServerClosedEvent <{+core-api+}/event/ServerClosedEvent.html>`__
     - `ServerListener <{+core-api+}/event/ServerListener.html>`__
     - Created when an existing server is removed from the topology.

   * - `ServerHeartbeatStartedEvent <{+core-api+}/event/ServerHeartbeatStartedEvent.html>`__
     - `ServerMonitorListener <{+core-api+}/event/ServerMonitorListener.html>`__
     - Created when the server monitor sends a ``hello`` command to the server.
       This action is called a heartbeat.

   * - `ServerHeartbeatSucceededEvent <{+core-api+}/event/ServerHeartbeatSucceededEvent.html>`__
     - `ServerMonitorListener <{+core-api+}/event/ServerMonitorListener.html>`__
     - Created when the heartbeat succeeds.

   * - `ServerHeartbeatFailedEvent <{+core-api+}/event/ServerHeartbeatFailedEvent.html>`__
     - `ServerMonitorListener <{+core-api+}/event/ServerMonitorListener.html>`__
     - Created when the heartbeat fails.
