  From a machine that can access the public internet, run the following 
  command to retrieve the latest version manifest for
  your |onprem| version from MongoDB:

  .. tip::

     Replace ``{OPS-MANAGER-VERSION}`` with your |onprem| major and minor
     version.

     .. example::

        ``4.2``

  .. code-block:: sh

     curl --request GET "https://opsmanager.mongodb.com/static/version_manifest/{OPS-MANAGER-VERSION}.json" \
          --header "Accept: application/json" \
          --output {OPS-MANAGER-VERSION}.json

  The |json| file you receive in response includes all data that your 
  |onprem| instance needs. This covers all versions and variants
  of MongoDB that your version of |onprem| supports.

  The parameters and values in this file -- as well as how they are
  structured -- can change without notice.

  From a host that can access your |onprem| instance, use the 
  :doc:`Update the Version Manifest
  </reference/api/version-manifest/update-version-manifest>` endpoint to
  upload the latest version manifest to |onprem|.

  Run the following command, replacing the placeholders with the :ref:`version-manifest-api-tutorial-vars`:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :linenos:

     curl --user "{PUBLIC-KEY}:{PRIVATE-KEY}" --digest \
          --header "Accept: application/json" \
          --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
          --include \
          --request PUT "https://{+opsmgr-url+}/api/public/v1.0/versionManifest?pretty=true" \
          --data @{OPS-MANAGER-VERSION}.json

content: |

  From a host that can access your |onprem| instance, use the 
  :doc:`Retrieve the Ops Manager Version Manifest
  </reference/api/version-manifest/get-om-version-manifest>` endpoint to
  confirm that |onprem| uses the latest version manifest. You *can* call  
  this endpoint without having an API 
  key.

  Run the following command, replacing the placeholders with the
  :ref:`version-manifest-api-tutorial-vars`:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :linenos:

     curl --digest --include \
          --header "Accept: application/json" \
          --request GET "https://{+opsmgr-url+}/api/public/v1.0/versionManifest?pretty=true"  

  The response should match the version manifest you downloaded from
  MongoDB and uploaded to your |onprem| instance.
