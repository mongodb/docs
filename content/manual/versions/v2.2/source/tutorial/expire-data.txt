This document provides an introduction to MongoDB's "*time to live*"
or ":term:`TTL`" collection feature. Implemented as a special index
type, TTL collections make it possible to store data in MongoDB and
have the :binary:`~bin.mongod` automatically remove data after a specified
period of time. This is ideal for some types of information like
machine generated event data, logs, and session information that only
need to persist in a database for a limited period of time.

Background
----------

Collections expire by way of a special index of a field with date
values in conjunction with a background thread in :binary:`~bin.mongod`
that regularly removes expired :term:`documents <document>` from the
collection. You can use this feature to expire data from
:term:`replica sets <replica set>` and :term:`sharded clusters
<sharded cluster>`.

Use the ``expireAfterSeconds`` option to the :method:`ensureIndex
<db.collection.ensureIndex()>` method in conjunction with a TTL value
in seconds to create an expiring collection. TTL collections set the
:collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` collection flag, which means MongoDB must
allocate more disk space relative to data size. This approach helps
mitigate the possibility of storage fragmentation caused by frequent
delete operations and leads to more predictable storage use patterns.

.. note::

   When the TTL thread is active, you will see a :doc:`delete
   </applications/delete>` operation in the output of
   :method:`db.currentOp()` or in the data collected by the
   :ref:`database profiler <database-profiler>`.

Constraints
-----------

Consider the following limitations:

- the indexed field must be a date :term:`BSON type <BSON types>`. If
  the field does not have a date type, the data will not expire.

- you cannot create this index on the ``_id`` field, or a field that
  already has an index.

- the TTL index may not be compound (may not have multiple fields).

- if the field holds an array, and there are multiple date-typed
  data in the index, the document will expire when the *lowest*
  (i.e. earliest) matches the expiration threshold.

- you cannot use a TTL index on a capped collection, because MongoDB
  cannot remove documents from a capped collection.

Enabling a TTL for a Collection
-------------------------------

To set a TTL on the collection "``log.events``" for one hour use the
following command at the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.log.events.ensureIndex( { "status": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 } )

The ``status`` field *must* hold date/time information. MongoDB will
automatically delete documents from this collection once the value of
``status`` is one or more hours old.

Replication
-----------

The TTL background thread *only* runs on :term:`primary` members of
:term:`replica sets <replica set>`. :term:`Secondaries <secondary>`
members will replicate deletion operations from the primaries.
