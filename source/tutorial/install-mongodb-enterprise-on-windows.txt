Overview
--------

Use this tutorial to install MongoDB {+version+} |edition| Edition on
Windows using the default installation wizard.

:products:`MongoDB Enterprise Edition</mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server>`
is available on select platforms and contains support for several
features related to security and monitoring.

MongoDB Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-install-past-mongodb.rst

Installation Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial installs MongoDB on Windows using the default MSI
installation wizard. To install MongoDB using the ``msiexec.exe``
command-line tool instead, see :doc:`Install MongoDB using msiexec.exe
</tutorial/install-mongodb-enterprise-on-windows-unattended>`. The
``msiexec.exe`` tool is useful for system administrators who wish to
deploy MongoDB in an unattended fashion using automation.

Considerations
--------------

MongoDB Shell, ``mongosh``

Install MongoDB Enterprise Edition
----------------------------------

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps to install MongoDB |edition| Edition using the
Windows Installation wizard. The installation process installs both the
MongoDB binaries as well as the default :doc:`configuration file
</reference/configuration-options>` :file:`<install
directory>\\bin\\mongod.cfg`.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-mongodb-on-windows-enterprise-interactive.rst

If You Installed MongoDB as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MongoDB service starts upon successful installation. Configure the
MongoDB instance with the configuration file
:file:`<install directory>\\bin\\mongod.cfg`.

If you have not already done so, follow the
:mongosh:`mongosh installation instructions </install>` to download and
install the MongoDB Shell (:mongosh:`mongosh </>`).

Be sure to add the path to your ``mongosh.exe`` binary to your
``PATH`` environment variable during installation.
  
Open a new :guilabel:`Command Interpreter` and enter ``mongosh.exe``
to connect to MongoDB.

For more information on connecting to ``mongod`` using
:mongosh:`mongosh.exe </>`, such as connecting to a MongoDB instance
running on a different host and/or port, see
:mongosh:`Connect to a Deployment </connect>`.

For information on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations,
see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/insert-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/query-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/update-documents`
- :doc:`/tutorial/remove-documents`

If You Did Not Install MongoDB as a Windows Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you only installed the executables and did not install MongoDB as a
Windows service, you must manually start the MongoDB instance.

See :ref:`run-mongodb-enterprise-from-cmd` for instructions to start a
MongoDB instance.

Start MongoDB Enterprise Edition from the Command Interpreter
-------------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/run-mongodb-on-windows.rst

.. _manually-create-windows-service-enterprise:

Start MongoDB Enterprise Edition as a Windows Service
-----------------------------------------------------

Starting in version 4.0, you can install and configure MongoDB as a
:guilabel:`Windows Service` during the install, the MongoDB service
starts upon successful installation.

To start/restart the MongoDB service, use the Services console:

#. From the Services console, locate the MongoDB service.

#. Right-click on the MongoDB service and click :guilabel:`Start`.

You can also manually manage the service from the command line. To
start the MongoDB service from the command line, open a `Windows
command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-
commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`, and
run the following command:

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-manually-windows-service-for-mongodb.rst


Stop MongoDB Enterprise Edition as a Windows Service
----------------------------------------------------

To stop/pause the MongoDB service, use the Services console:

#. From the Services console, locate the MongoDB service.

#. Right-click on the MongoDB service and click :guilabel:`Stop` (or :guilabel:`Pause`).

You can also manage the service from the command line. To stop the
MongoDB service from the command line, open a `Windows command
prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-
commands/cmd>`__ (``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`, and
run the following command:

.. code-block:: bat

   net stop MongoDB

Remove MongoDB Enterprise Edition as a Windows Service
------------------------------------------------------

To remove the MongoDB service, first use the Services console to stop
the service. Then open a `Windows command prompt/interpreter
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd>`__
(``cmd.exe``) as an :guilabel:`Administrator`, and
run the following command:

.. code-block:: bat

   sc.exe delete MongoDB

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Localhost Binding by Default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-installation-bind-ip-default-in-config.rst

Point Releases and ``.msi``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed MongoDB with the Windows installer (``.msi``), that
``.msi`` automatically upgrades within its :ref:`release series
<release-version-numbers>` (e.g. 4.2.1 to 4.2.2).

Upgrading a full release series (e.g. 4.0 to 4.2) requires a new
installation.

Add MongoDB binaries to the System PATH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All command-line examples in this tutorial are provided with absolute
paths to the MongoDB binaries. You can add ``C:\Program
Files\MongoDB\Server\{+version+}\bin`` to your System ``PATH`` and then
omit the full path to the MongoDB binaries.
