=============================
Replica Set High Availability
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` provide high availability using
automatic :term:`failover`. Failover allows a :term:`secondary`
member to become :term:`primary` if primary is unavailable. Failover,
in most situations does not require manual intervention.

Replica set members keep the same data set but are otherwise
independent. If the primary becomes unavailable, the replica set holds
an :doc:`election </core/replica-set-elections>` to select a new
primary. In some situations, the failover process may require
a :doc:`rollback </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`. [#rollback-automatic]_

The deployment of a replica set affects the outcome of failover
situations. To support effective failover, ensure that one facility
can elect a primary if needed. Choose the facility that hosts the core
application systems to host the majority of the replica set. Place a
majority of voting members and all the members that can become primary
in this facility. Otherwise, network partitions could prevent the set
from being able to form a majority.

.. [#rollback-automatic] Replica sets remove "rollback" data when
   needed without intervention. Administrators must apply or discard
   rollback data manually.

Failover Processes
------------------

The replica set recovers from the loss of a primary by holding an
election. Consider the following:
