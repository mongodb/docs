.. pipeline:: $lookup

   .. versionchanged:: 8.0

   Performs a left outer join to a collection in the *same* database to
   filter in documents from the foreign collection for processing. The
   :pipeline:`$lookup` stage adds a new array field to each input
   document. The new array field contains the matching documents from
   the foreign collection. The :pipeline:`$lookup` stage passes these
   reshaped documents to the next stage.

   Starting in MongoDB 5.1, you can use :pipeline:`$lookup` with sharded
   collections.

   To combine elements from two different collections, use the
   :pipeline:`$unionWith` pipeline stage.

   .. important::

      Excessive use of ``$lookup`` may slow down query performance. To
      reduce reliance on ``$lookup``, consider an :ref:`embedded data
      model <data-modeling-embedding>` to store related data in a single
      collection.

      For details on ``$lookup`` performance, see
      :ref:`lookup-performance-considerations`.

Syntax
------

The :pipeline:`$lookup` stage syntax: 

.. code-block:: none

   {
      $lookup:
        {
          from: <collection to join>,
          localField: <field from the input documents>,
          foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
          let: { <var_1>: <expression>, …, <var_n>: <expression> },
          pipeline: [ <pipeline to run> ],
          as: <output array field>
        }
   }

The :pipeline:`$lookup` accepts a document with these fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 80

   * - Field
     - Necessity
     - Description

   * - :ref:`from <lookup-subquery-from>`

     - Required

     - .. _lookup-subquery-from:
     
       Specifies the foreign collection in the *same* database to join
       to the local collection.

       .. include:: /includes/lookup-from.rst
       
       Starting in MongoDB 5.1, the ``from`` collection can be sharded.

   * - :ref:`localField <lookup-subquery-localField>`

     - Optional if ``pipeline`` is specified

     - .. _lookup-subquery-localField:
     
       Specifies the field from the documents input to the
       :pipeline:`$lookup` stage. :pipeline:`$lookup` performs an
       equality match on the ``localField`` to the
       ``foreignField`` from the documents of the ``from``
       collection. If an input document does not contain the
       ``localField``, the :pipeline:`$lookup` treats the
       field as having a value of ``null`` for matching purposes.

   * - :ref:`foreignField <lookup-subquery-foreignField>`

     - Optional if ``pipeline`` is specified

     - .. _lookup-subquery-foreignField:
     
       Specifies the foreign documents' ``foreignField`` to perform an
       equality match with the local documents' ``localField``.
       
       If a foreign document does not contain a ``foreignField`` value,
       the :pipeline:`$lookup` uses a ``null`` value for the match.

   * - :ref:`let <lookup-subquery-let>`

     - Optional

     - .. _lookup-subquery-let:

       Specifies variables to use in the :ref:`pipeline 
       <lookup-subquery-pipeline>` stages. Use the variable expressions to
       access the fields from the local collection's documents that are
       input to the ``pipeline``.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-let-variable-access-note.rst

   * - :ref:`pipeline <lookup-subquery-pipeline>`

     - Optional if ``localField`` and ``foreignField`` are specified 

     - .. _lookup-subquery-pipeline:
     
       Specifies the ``pipeline`` to run on the foreign collection. The
       ``pipeline`` returns documents from the foreign collection. To
       return all documents, specify an empty ``pipeline: []``.

       The ``pipeline`` cannot include the :pipeline:`$out` or
       :pipeline:`$merge` stages. Starting in v6.0, the ``pipeline`` 
       can contain the :atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search>` 
       :pipeline:`$search` stage as the first stage inside the 
       pipeline. To learn more, see :ref:`fts-lookup-behavior`.

       The ``pipeline`` cannot access fields from input documents.
       Instead, define variables for the document fields using the
       :ref:`let <lookup-subquery-let>` option and
       then reference the variables in the ``pipeline`` stages.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-let-variable-access-note.rst
 
   * - :ref:`as <lookup-subquery-as>`
  
     - Required

     - .. _lookup-subquery-as:
     
       Specifies the name of the new array field to add to the input
       documents. The new array field contains the matching
       documents from the ``from`` collection. If the specified name
       already exists in the input document, the existing field is
       *overwritten*.

.. _lookup-single-equality:

Equality Match with a Single Join Condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an equality match between a field from the input documents
with a field from the documents of the foreign collection, the
:pipeline:`$lookup` stage has this syntax:

.. code-block:: none

   {
      $lookup:
        {
          from: <collection to join>,
          localField: <field from the input documents>,
          foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
          pipeline: [ <pipeline to run> ],
          as: <output array field>
        }
   }

.. note::

   In this example, ``pipeline`` is optional and runs after
   the local and foreign equality stage. 

The operation corresponds to this pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql
   :copyable: false

   SELECT *, (
      SELECT ARRAY_AGG(*)
      FROM <collection to join>
      WHERE <foreignField> = <collection.localField>
   ) AS <output array field>
   FROM collection;

.. note::

   The SQL statements on this page are included for comparison to the
   MongoDB aggregation pipeline syntax. The SQL statements aren't
   runnable.

For MongoDB examples, see these pages:

- :ref:`lookup-single-equality-example`
- :ref:`unwind-example`
- :ref:`lookup-mergeObjects`

.. _lookup-syntax-let-pipeline:

Join Conditions and Subqueries on a Foreign Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports:

- Executing a pipeline on a foreign collection.

- Multiple join conditions.

- Correlated and uncorrelated subqueries.

In MongoDB, an uncorrelated subquery means that every input document will return
the same result. A correlated subquery is a :ref:`pipeline 
<lookup-subquery-pipeline>` in a :pipeline:`$lookup` stage that uses the local
or ``input`` collection's fields to return results correlated to each incoming
document.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/uncorrelated-subquery.rst

MongoDB correlated subqueries are comparable to SQL correlated
subqueries, where the inner query references outer query values. An
SQL uncorrelated subquery does not reference outer query values.

MongoDB 5.0 also supports :ref:`concise correlated subqueries
<lookup-syntax-concise-correlated-subquery>`.

To perform correlated and uncorrelated subqueries with two collections,
and perform other join conditions besides a single equality match, use
this :pipeline:`$lookup` syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      $lookup:
         {
            from: <foreign collection>,
            let: { <var_1>: <expression>, …, <var_n>: <expression> },
            pipeline: [ <pipeline to run on foreign collection> ],
            as: <output array field>
         }
   }

The operation corresponds to this pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql
   :copyable: false

   SELECT *, <output array field>
   FROM collection
   WHERE <output array field> IN (
      SELECT <documents as determined from the pipeline>
      FROM <collection to join>
      WHERE <pipeline>
   );

See the following examples:

- :ref:`lookup-multiple-joins`
- :ref:`lookup-uncorrelated-subquery`

.. _lookup-syntax-concise-correlated-subquery:

Correlated Subqueries Using Concise Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 5.0

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, you can use a concise syntax for a correlated
subquery. Correlated subqueries reference document fields from a foreign
collection  *and* the "local" collection on which the
:method:`~db.collection.aggregate()` method was run.

The following new concise syntax removes the requirement for an equality
match on the foreign and local fields inside of an :query:`$expr`
operator:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   {
      $lookup:
         {
            from: <foreign collection>,
            localField: <field from local collection's documents>,
            foreignField: <field from foreign collection's documents>,
            let: { <var_1>: <expression>, …, <var_n>: <expression> },
            pipeline: [ <pipeline to run> ],
            as: <output array field>
         }
   }

The operation corresponds to this pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql
   :copyable: false

   SELECT *, <output array field>
   FROM localCollection
   WHERE <output array field> IN (
      SELECT <documents as determined from the pipeline>
      FROM <foreignCollection>
      WHERE <foreignCollection.foreignField> = <localCollection.localField>
      AND <pipeline match condition>
   );

See this example:

Views and Collation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/views-collation-agg.rst

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot include the :pipeline:`$out` or the :pipeline:`$merge`
stage in the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage. That is, when specifying a
:ref:`pipeline for the foreign collection
<lookup-syntax-let-pipeline>`, you cannot include either stage in
the ``pipeline`` field.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 6

   {
      $lookup:
      {
         from: <collection to join>,
         let: { <var_1>: <expression>, …, <var_n>: <expression> },
         pipeline: [ <pipeline to execute on the foreign collection> ],  // Cannot include $out or $merge
         as: <output array field>
      }
   }

.. _fts-lookup-behavior:

Atlas Search Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, you can specify the :atlas:`Atlas Search
</atlas-search>` :pipeline:`$search` or :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage
in the ``$lookup`` pipeline to search collections on the Atlas
cluster. The :pipeline:`$search` or the :pipeline:`$searchMeta` stage
must be the first stage inside the ``$lookup`` pipeline.

For example, when you :ref:`lookup-syntax-let-pipeline` or run
:ref:`lookup-syntax-concise-correlated-subquery`, you can specify
:pipeline:`$search` or :pipeline:`$searchMeta` inside the pipeline as
shown below:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: $search
      :tabid: search

      .. code-block::
         :copyable: false
         :emphasize-lines: 7-11

         [{
           "$lookup": {
             "from": <foreign collection>,
             localField: <field from the input documents>,
             foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
             "as": <output array field>,
             "pipeline": [{
               "$search": {
                 "<operator>": {
                   <operator-specification>
                 }
               },
               ...
             }]
           }
         }]

   .. tab:: $searchMeta
      :tabid: searchmeta

      .. code-block::
         :copyable: false
         :emphasize-lines: 7-11

         [{
           "$lookup": {
             "from": <foreign collection>,
             localField: <field from the input documents>,
             foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
             "as": <output array field>,
             "pipeline": [{
               "$searchMeta": {
                 "<collector>": {
                   <collector-specification>
                 }
               },
               ...
             }]
           }
         }]

Using $lookup </atlas-search/tutorial/lookup-with-search/>`.

.. _lookup-sharded-collections:

Sharded Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.1, you can specify :ref:`sharded collections
<sharding-sharded-cluster>` in the ``from`` parameter of
:pipeline:`$lookup` stages.

Starting in MongoDB 8.0, you can use the ``$lookup`` stage within a
transaction while targeting a sharded collection.

.. _lookup-performance-considerations:

Performance Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``$lookup`` performance depends on the type of operation performed.
Refer to the following table for performance considerations for
different ``$lookup`` operations.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - ``$lookup`` Operation
     - Performance Considerations

   * - :ref:`Equality Match with a Single Join
       <lookup-single-equality-example>`

     - .. _equality-match-performance:

       - ``$lookup`` operations that perform equality matches with a
         single join perform better when the foreign collection contains
         an index on the ``foreignField``.

         :gold:`IMPORTANT:` If a supporting index on the ``foreignField`` does
         not exist, a ``$lookup`` operation that performs an equality match with
         a single join will likely have poor performance.

   * - :ref:`Uncorrelated Subqueries <lookup-uncorrelated-subquery>`

     - .. _uncorrelated-subqueries-performance:

       - ``$lookup`` operations that contain uncorrelated subqueries
         perform better when the inner pipeline can reference an
         index of the foreign collection.

       - MongoDB only needs to run the ``$lookup`` subquery once before
         caching the query because there is no relationship between the
         source and foreign collections. The subquery is not based on
         any value in the source collection. This behavior improves
         performance for subsequent executions of the ``$lookup``
         operation.

   * - :ref:`Correlated Subqueries <lookup-concise-correlated-subquery>`

     - .. _correlated-subqueries-performance:

       - ``$lookup`` operations that contain correlated subqueries
         perform better when the following conditions apply:

         - The foreign collection contains an index on the
           ``foreignField``.

         - The foreign collection contains an index that references the
           inner pipline.

       - If your pipeline passes a large number of documents to the
         ``$lookup`` query, the following strategies may improve
         performance:

         - Reduce the number of documents that MongoDB passes to the
           ``$lookup`` query. For example, set a stricter filter
           during the ``$match`` stage.

         - Run the inner pipeline of the ``$lookup`` subquery as a
           separate query and use ``$out`` to create a temporary
           collection. Then, run an :ref:`equality match with a single
           join <lookup-single-equality>`.

         - Reconsider the data's schema to ensure it is optimal for the
           use case.

For general performance strategies, see :ref:`Indexing Strategies
<manual-indexing-strategies>` and :ref:`Query Optimization
<read-operations-indexing>`.

      Perform a Single Equality Join with ``$lookup``
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Create a collection ``orders`` with these documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.orders.insertMany( [
            { _id: 1, item: "almonds", price: 12, quantity: 2 },
            { _id: 2, item: "pecans", price: 20, quantity: 1 },
            { _id: 3  }
         ] )

      Create another collection ``inventory`` with these documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.inventory.insertMany( [
            { _id: 1, sku: "almonds", description: "product 1", instock: 120 },
            { _id: 2, sku: "bread", description: "product 2", instock: 80 },
            { _id: 3, sku: "cashews", description: "product 3", instock: 60 },
            { _id: 4, sku: "pecans", description: "product 4", instock: 70 },
            { _id: 5, sku: null, description: "Incomplete" },
            { _id: 6 }
         ] )

      The following aggregation operation on the ``orders`` collection
      joins the documents from ``orders`` with the documents from the
      ``inventory`` collection using the fields ``item`` from the
      ``orders`` collection and the ``sku`` field from the ``inventory``
      collection:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.orders.aggregate( [
            {
              $lookup:
                {
                  from: "inventory",
                  localField: "item",
                  foreignField: "sku",
                  as: "inventory_docs"
                }
           }
         ] )

      The operation returns these documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         {
            _id: 1,
            item: "almonds",
            price: 12,
            quantity: 2,
            inventory_docs: [
               { _id: 1, sku: "almonds", description: "product 1", instock: 120 }
            ]
         }
         {
            _id: 2,
            item: "pecans",
            price: 20,
            quantity: 1,
            inventory_docs: [
               { _id: 4, sku: "pecans", description: "product 4", instock: 70 }
            ]
         }
         {
            _id: 3,
            inventory_docs: [
               { _id: 5, sku: null, description: "Incomplete" },
               { _id: 6 }
            ]
         }

      The operation corresponds to this pseudo-SQL statement:

      .. code-block:: sql
         :copyable: false

         SELECT *, inventory_docs
         FROM orders
         WHERE inventory_docs IN (
            SELECT *
            FROM inventory
            WHERE sku = orders.item
         );

      For more information, see
      :ref:`Equality Match Performance Considerations <equality-match-performance>`.

      .. _unwind-example:

      Use ``$lookup`` with an Array
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      If the ``localField`` is an array, you can match the array elements
      against a scalar ``foreignField`` without an :pipeline:`$unwind` stage.

      For example, create an example collection ``classes`` with these
      documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.classes.insertMany( [
            { _id: 1, title: "Reading is ...", enrollmentlist: [ "giraffe2", "pandabear", "artie" ], days: ["M", "W", "F"] },
            { _id: 2, title: "But Writing ...", enrollmentlist: [ "giraffe1", "artie" ], days: ["T", "F"] }
         ] )

      Create another collection ``members`` with these documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.members.insertMany( [
            { _id: 1, name: "artie", foreign: new Date("2016-05-01"), status: "A" }, 
            { _id: 2, name: "giraffe", foreign: new Date("2017-05-01"), status: "D" }, 
            { _id: 3, name: "giraffe1", foreign: new Date("2017-10-01"), status: "A" }, 
            { _id: 4, name: "panda", foreign: new Date("2018-10-11"), status: "A" },  
            { _id: 5, name: "pandabear", foreign: new Date("2018-12-01"), status: "A" },
            { _id: 6, name: "giraffe2", foreign: new Date("2018-12-01"), status: "D" }
         ] )

      The following aggregation operation joins documents in the ``classes``
      collection with the ``members`` collection, matching on the
      ``enrollmentlist`` field to the ``name`` field:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.classes.aggregate( [
            {
               $lookup:
                  {
                     from: "members",
                     localField: "enrollmentlist",
                     foreignField: "name",
                     as: "enrollee_info"
                 }
            }
         ] )

      The operation returns the following:

      .. code-block:: javascript

      .. _lookup-mergeObjects:

      Use ``$lookup`` with ``$mergeObjects``
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      The :expression:`$mergeObjects` operator combines multiple documents
      into a single document.

      Create a collection ``orders`` with these documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.orders.insertMany( [
            { _id: 1, item: "almonds", price: 12, quantity: 2 },
            { _id: 2, item: "pecans", price: 20, quantity: 1 }
         ] )

      Create another collection ``items`` with these documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.items.insertMany( [
           { _id: 1, item: "almonds", description: "almond clusters", instock: 120 },
           { _id: 2, item: "bread", description: "raisin and nut bread", instock: 80 },
           { _id: 3, item: "pecans", description: "candied pecans", instock: 60 }
         ] )

      The following operation first uses the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage to
      join the two collections by the ``item`` fields and then uses
      :expression:`$mergeObjects` in the :pipeline:`$replaceRoot` to merge
      the foreign documents from ``items`` and ``orders``:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.orders.aggregate( [
            {
               $lookup: {
                  from: "items",
                  localField: "item",    // field in the orders collection
                  foreignField: "item",  // field in the items collection
                  as: "fromItems"
               }
            },
            {
               $replaceRoot: { newRoot: { $mergeObjects: [ { $arrayElemAt: [ "$fromItems", 0 ] }, "$$ROOT" ] } }
            },
            { $project: { fromItems: 0 } }
         ] )

      The operation returns these documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         {
           _id: 1,
           item: 'almonds',
           description: 'almond clusters',
           instock: 120,
           price: 12,
           quantity: 2
         },
         {
           _id: 2,
           item: 'pecans',
           description: 'candied pecans',
           instock: 60,
           price: 20,
           quantity: 1
         }

      .. _lookup-multiple-joins:

      Use Multiple Join Conditions and a Correlated Subquery
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Pipelines can execute on a foreign collection and include multiple join
      conditions. The :query:`$expr` operator enables more complex join
      conditions including conjunctions and non-equality matches.

      A join condition can reference a field in the local collection on which
      the :method:`~db.collection.aggregate()` method was run and reference a
      field in the foreign collection. This allows a correlated subquery
      between the two collections.

      MongoDB 5.0 supports :ref:`concise correlated subqueries
      <lookup-concise-correlated-subquery>`.

      Create a collection ``orders`` with these documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.orders.insertMany( [
           { _id: 1, item: "almonds", price: 12, ordered: 2 },
           { _id: 2, item: "pecans", price: 20, ordered: 1 },
           { _id: 3, item: "cookies", price: 10, ordered: 60 }
         ] )

      Create another collection ``warehouses`` with these documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.warehouses.insertMany( [
           { _id: 1, stock_item: "almonds", warehouse: "A", instock: 120 },
           { _id: 2, stock_item: "pecans", warehouse: "A", instock: 80 },
           { _id: 3, stock_item: "almonds", warehouse: "B", instock: 60 },
           { _id: 4, stock_item: "cookies", warehouse: "B", instock: 40 },
           { _id: 5, stock_item: "cookies", warehouse: "A", instock: 80 }
         ] )

      The following example:

      - Uses a correlated subquery with a join on the ``orders.item`` and
        ``warehouse.stock_item`` fields.

      - Ensures the quantity of the item in stock can fulfill the
        ordered quantity.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.orders.aggregate( [
            {
               $lookup:
                  {
                    from : "warehouses",
                    localField : "item",
                    foreignField : "stock_item",
                    let : { order_qty: "$ordered" },
                    pipeline : [
                       { $match : 
                          { $expr : 
                               { $gte: [ "$instock", "$$order_qty" ] }
                          }
                       },
                       { $project : { stock_item: 0, _id: 0 } }
                    ],
                    as : "stockdata"
                  }
             }
         ] )

      The operation returns these documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         {
           _id: 1,
           item: 'almonds',
           price: 12,
           ordered: 2,
           stockdata: [
             { warehouse: 'A', instock: 120 },
             { warehouse: 'B', instock: 60 }
           ]
         },
         {
           _id: 2,
           item: 'pecans',
           price: 20,
           ordered: 1,
           stockdata: [ { warehouse: 'A', instock: 80 } ]
         },
         {
           _id: 3,
           item: 'cookies',
           price: 10,
           ordered: 60,
           stockdata: [ { warehouse: 'A', instock: 80 } ]
         }

      The operation corresponds to this pseudo-SQL statement:

      .. code-block:: sql
         :copyable: false

         SELECT *, stockdata
         FROM orders
         WHERE stockdata IN (
            SELECT warehouse, instock
            FROM warehouses
            WHERE stock_item = orders.item
            AND instock >= orders.ordered
         );

      .. include:: /includes/expr-operators-and-indexes.rst

      For example, if the index ``{ stock_item: 1, instock: 1 }`` exists on
      the ``warehouses`` collection:

      - The equality match on the ``warehouses.stock_item`` field uses the
        index.
      - The range part of the query on the ``warehouses.instock`` field
        also uses the indexed field in the compound index.

      .. _lookup-uncorrelated-subquery:

      Perform an Uncorrelated Subquery with ``$lookup``
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      An aggregation pipeline :pipeline:`$lookup` stage can execute a pipeline
      on the foreign collection, which allows uncorrelated subqueries. An
      uncorrelated subquery does not reference the local document fields.

      .. note::

         .. include:: /includes/uncorrelated-subquery.rst

      Create a collection ``absences`` with these documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.absences.insertMany( [
            { _id: 1, student: "Ann Aardvark", sickdays: [ new Date ("2018-05-01"),new Date ("2018-08-23") ] },
            { _id: 2, student: "Zoe Zebra", sickdays: [ new Date ("2018-02-01"),new Date ("2018-05-23") ] },
         ] )

      Create another collection ``holidays`` with these documents:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.holidays.insertMany( [
            { _id: 1, year: 2018, name: "New Years", date: new Date("2018-01-01") },
            { _id: 2, year: 2018, name: "Pi Day", date: new Date("2018-03-14") },
            { _id: 3, year: 2018, name: "Ice Cream Day", date: new Date("2018-07-15") },
            { _id: 4, year: 2017, name: "New Years", date: new Date("2017-01-01") },
            { _id: 5, year: 2017, name: "Ice Cream Day", date: new Date("2017-07-16") }
         ] )

      The following operation joins the ``absences`` collection with 2018
      holiday information from the ``holidays`` collection:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.absences.aggregate( [
            {
               $lookup:
                  {
                    from: "holidays",
                    pipeline: [
                       { $match: { year: 2018 } },
                       { $project: { _id: 0, date: { name: "$name", date: "$date" } } },
                       { $replaceRoot: { newRoot: "$date" } }

                  }
             }
         ] )

      The operation returns the following:

      .. _lookup-concise-correlated-subquery:

      Perform a Concise Correlated Subquery with ``$lookup``
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. versionadded:: 5.0

      Starting in MongoDB 5.0, an aggregation pipeline :pipeline:`$lookup`
      stage supports a :ref:`concise correlated subquery syntax
      <lookup-syntax-concise-correlated-subquery>` that improves joins between
      collections. The new concise syntax removes the requirement for an
      equality match on the foreign and local fields inside of an
      :query:`$expr` operator in a :pipeline:`$match` stage.

      Create a collection ``restaurants``:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.restaurants.insertMany( [
            {
               _id: 1,
               name: "American Steak House",
               food: [ "filet", "sirloin" ],
               beverages: [ "beer", "wine" ]
            },
            {
               _id: 2,
               name: "Honest John Pizza",
               food: [ "cheese pizza", "pepperoni pizza" ],
               beverages: [ "soda" ]
            }
         ] )

      Create another collection ``orders`` with food and optional drink
      orders:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.orders.insertMany( [
            {
               _id: 1,
               item: "filet",
               restaurant_name: "American Steak House"
            },
            {
               _id: 2,
               item: "cheese pizza",
               restaurant_name: "Honest John Pizza",
               drink: "lemonade"
            },
            {
               _id: 3,
               item: "cheese pizza",
               restaurant_name: "Honest John Pizza",
               drink: "soda"
            }
         ] )

      The following example:

      - Joins the ``orders`` and ``restaurants`` collections by matching the
        ``orders.restaurant_name`` :ref:`localField <lookup-subquery-localField>` with
        the ``restaurants.name`` :ref:`foreignField <lookup-subquery-foreignField>`. 
        The match is performed before the ``pipeline`` is run.

      - Performs an :expression:`$in` array match between the ``orders.drink``
        and ``restaurants.beverages`` fields that are accessed using
        ``$$orders_drink`` and ``$beverages`` respectively.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.orders.aggregate( [
            {
               $lookup: {
                  from: "restaurants",
                  localField: "restaurant_name",
                  foreignField: "name",
                  let: { orders_drink: "$drink" },
                  pipeline: [ {
                     $match: {
                        $expr: { $in: [ "$$orders_drink", "$beverages" ] }
                     }
                  } ],
                  as: "matches"
               }
            }
         ] )

      There is a match for the ``soda`` value in the ``orders.drink`` and
      ``restaurants.beverages`` fields. This output shows the ``matches``
      array and contains all foreign fields from the ``restaurants`` collection
      for the match:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

         {
            _id: 1, item: "filet",
            restaurant_name: "American Steak House",
            matches: [ ]
         }
         {
            _id: 2, item: "cheese pizza",
            restaurant_name: "Honest John Pizza",
            drink: "lemonade",
            matches: [ ]
         }
         {
            _id: 3, item: "cheese pizza",
            restaurant_name: "Honest John Pizza",
            drink: "soda",
            matches: [ {
               _id: 2, name": "Honest John Pizza",
               food: [ "cheese pizza", "pepperoni pizza" ],
               beverages: [ "soda" ]
            } ]
         }

      This example uses the older verbose syntax from MongoDB versions before
      5.0 and returns the same results as the previous concise example:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.orders.aggregate( [
            {
               $lookup: {
                  from: "restaurants",
                  let: { orders_restaurant_name: "$restaurant_name",
                         orders_drink: "$drink" },
                  pipeline: [ {
                     $match: {
                        $expr: {
                           $and: [
                              { $eq: [ "$$orders_restaurant_name", "$name" ] },
                              { $in: [ "$$orders_drink", "$beverages" ] }

      The previous examples correspond to this pseudo-SQL statement:

      .. code-block:: sql
         :copyable: false

         SELECT *, matches
         FROM orders
         WHERE matches IN (
            SELECT *
            FROM restaurants
            WHERE restaurants.name = orders.restaurant_name
            AND restaurants.beverages = orders.drink
         );

      Starting in MongoDB 8.0, the following example returns an error because
      it contains an invalid ``from`` field:

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :emphasize-lines: 3

         db.cakeFlavors.aggregate( [ {
            $lookup: {
               from: "cakeFlavors",
               pipeline: [ { $documents: [ {} ] } ],
               as: "test"
            }
         } ] )

      In MongoDB versions before 8.0, the previous example runs.

      For an example with a valid ``from`` field, see
