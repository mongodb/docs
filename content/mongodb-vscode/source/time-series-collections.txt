You can create 
:manual:`time series collections </core/timeseries-collections/>` using 
a MongoDB Playground. 

Prerequisites
-------------

If you have not done so already, you must complete the following 
prerequisites before you can create a time series collection with a 
MongoDB Playground:

- :ref:`Create a connection to a MongoDB deployment 
  <vsce-connect-task>`.
- :ref:`Activate the connection to the MongoDB deployment 
  <vsce-activate-connection>`.

Create a Time Series Collection
-------------------------------

Once you connect to your deployment using MongoDB for VS code, use the left 
navigation to: 

1. Expand an active connection and hover over the database where you want 
   your collection to exist.

#. Click the :icon-fa5:`plus` icon that appears. 

#. A MongoDB playground automatically opens with a template form to create 
   both regular collections and time series collections.

#. Delete the regular collection form and uncomment the time series form.

#. Fill in the provided fields with details for your time series collection.

#. To run the playground, click the :guilabel:`Play Button` at the top right
   of the VS code navigation bar.

After running the playground with the time series collection, the left 
navigation will update the collection icon to identify it is a 
time series collection.

     :manual:`Time Series Collections </core/timeseries-collections/>` 

   - To add documents to the collection, see 
     :ref:`vsce-create-doc-playground`.  

Example
-------

This example creates a time series collection named ``weather`` in the ``test`` 
database.

To use this example, start with a collection template from your MongoDB 
Playgrounds. Delete the template form for regular collections and keep the 
template for time series collections found below the regular collection 
template. 

.. code-block:: javascript

   use('test');

   db.createCollection(
    "weather",
    {
       timeseries: {
          timeField: "timestamp",
          granularity: "hours",
          bucketMaxSpanSeconds: 60,
          bucketRoundingSeconds: 60
       }
    }
  )

In the example:

- ``use('test')`` selects the database where the collection is added to.

- ``timeseries`` specifies fields to create a time series collection.

  - ``timeField: "timestamp"`` names the field that contains the dates in 
    the time series documents. In this case, it is ``timestamp``.

  - ``granularity: "hours"`` defines the time scale by which the documents
    are stored. 

  - ``bucketMaxSpanSeconds`` defines a maximum time span of 60 seconds
    for each bucket.

  - ``bucketRoundingSeconds`` specifies the time interval that
    determines the starting timestamp for a new bucket. 

When you press the :guilabel:`Play Button`, MongoDB for VS Code splits your 
Playground and outputs the following result in the Playground Results.json 
pane to confirm the creation of the time series collection. 

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "ok": 1
   }

The ``weather`` collection also appears in your collection list, and is 
marked with the time series icon.
