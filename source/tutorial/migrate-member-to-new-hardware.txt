============================================
Migrate a Replica Set Member to a New Server
============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

For MMS managed replica sets, you can replace one member of a
:term:`replica set` with another new member from the MMS console. Use this
process to migrate members of replica sets to new underlying
servers. From a high level, this procedure requires that you: you add
a member to the replica set on the new server and then shut down the
existing member on the old server. Specifically, you will

1. Provision the new server.

2. Add an extra member to the replica set.

3. Shut down old member of the replica set.

4. Un-manage the old member (Optional).

Considerations
--------------

Initial Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you add a new replica set member, the member must perform an
:term:`initial sync`, which takes time to complete, depending on the
size of your data set. For more information on initial sync, see
:manual:`Replica Set Data Synchronization </core/replica-set-sync>`.

Migrating Multiple Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are moving multiple members to new servers, migrate each member
separately to keep the replica set :doc:`available
</core/replica-set-high-availability>`.

Procedure
---------

Perform this procedure separately for each member of a replica set to
migrate.
