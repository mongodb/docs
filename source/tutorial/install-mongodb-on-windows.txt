Install MongoDB on Windows
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

This tutorial outlines the basic installation process for
:term:`MongoDB` on Microsoft Windows systems. This tutorial provides a
basic method for installing and running the MongoDB server
(i.e. ":program:`mongod.exe`") on Windows systems through the
:guilabel:`Command Shell` and will also outline the process for
setting up MongoDB as a :guilabel:`Windows Service`.

MongoDB on Windows is similar to MongoDB in other environments: and
most components have similar operations with similar operational
patterns.

Procedure
---------

Download MongoDB for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the latest production release of MongoDB from the `MongoDB
downloads page <http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>`_.

.. note::

   Ensure you download the proper version of MongoDB for your
   architecture of Windows. The 64-bit version of MongoDB will not
   work in 32-bit Windows.

   The 32-bit versions of MongoDB are suitable for testing and
   evaluation purposes but can only support small databases and are
   not appropriate for production deployments.

   You can find the architecture of your version of Windows
   installation using the following command in the :guilabel:`Command
   Shell`

   .. code-block:: powershell

      wmic os get osarchitecture

In Windows Explorer, find the MongoDB download file, typically in the
default Downloads directory, and extract the archive to ``C:\`` by
right clicking on the archive and selecting :guilabel:`Extract All`
and browsing to ``C:\``.

.. note::

   The folder name will be either:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\mongodb-win32-i386-[version]

   Or:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\mongodb-win32-x86_64-[version]

   In both examples, replace ``[version]`` with the version of MongoDB
   downloaded.

Set up the Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start the :guilabel:`Command Shell` by selecting the :guilabel:`Start
Menu`, then :guilabel:`All Programs`, then :guilabel:`Accessories`,
then right click :guilabel:`Command Shell`, and select :guilabel:`Run
as Administrator` from the popup menu. In the :guilabel:`Command
Shell`, issue the following commands:

.. code-block:: powershell

   cd \
   move C:\mongodb-win32-* C:\mongodb

.. note::

   MongoDB is self-contained and does not have any other system
   dependencies. You can run MongoDB from any folder you choose. You
   may install MongoDB in any directory (e.g. ``D:\test\mongodb``)

MongoDB requires a data folder to store its files. The default
location for the MongoDB data directory is ``C:\data\db``. Create this
folder using the :guilabel:`Command Shell` and issuing the following
command sequence:

.. code-block:: powershell

   md data
   md data\db

.. note::

   You may specify an alternate path for ``\data\db`` with the
   :setting:`dbpath` setting for :program:`mongod.ext`, as in the
   following example:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --dbpath d:\test\mongodb\data

   If your path includes spaces, enclose the entire path in double
   quotations, for example:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --dbpath "d:\test\mongo db data"


Start MongoDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start MongoDB, execute from the :guilabel:`Command Shell`:

.. code-block:: powershell

   C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe

This will start the main MongoDB database process.

.. note::

   Depending on the security level of your system, Windows will issue
   a :guilabel:`Security Alert` dialog box about blocking "some
   features" of ``C:\\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe`` from communicating on
   networks. All users should select ``Private Networks, such as my
   home or work network`` and click ``Allow access``. For additional
   information on security and MongoDB, please read the
   :wiki:`Security and Authentication <Security+and+Authentication>`
   wiki page.

.. warning::

   Do not make :program:`mongod.exe` accessible to public networks
   without running in "Secure Mode" (i.e. :setting:`auth`) on a public
   network. Usually, MongoDB runs in "trusted environments" and the
   database does not enable authentication or "Secure Mode" by
   default.

To connect to MongoDB using the :program:`mongo.exe`, open another
:guilabel:`Command Shell` and issue command:

.. code-block:: powershell

   C:\mongodb\bin\mongo.exe

.. note::

   Executing the command ``start C:\mongodb\bin\mongo.exe`` will
   automatically start the :program:`mongo` shell in a separate
   :guilabel:`Command Shell` window.

This :program:`mongo` shell will connect to the database running on
the localhost interface and port ``27017`` by default. At the
:program:`mongo.exe` prompt, issue the following two commands to
insert a record in the ``test`` :term:`collection` of the default
``test`` database and then retrieve that record:

.. code-block:: javascript

   > db.test.save( { a: 1 } )
   > db.test.find()

.. seealso:: ":program:`mongo`" and ":doc:`/reference/javascript`." If
   you want to develop applications using .NET, see the :wiki:` C#
   Language Center <CSharp+Language+Center>` page on the wiki for more
   information.

MongoDB as a Windows Service
----------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0 

Setup MongoDB as a :guilabel:`Windows Service`, so that the database
will start automatically following each reboot cycle.

.. note:: 
   
   :program:`mongod.exe` added support for running as a Windows
   service in version 2.0, and :program:`mongos.exe` added support for
   running as a Windows Service in version 2.1.1.

Configure the System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should specify two options when running MongoDB as a Windows
Service: a path for the log output (i.e. :setting:`logpath`) and a
:doc:`configuration file </reference/configuration-options>`.

#. Create a specific directory for MongoDB log files:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      md C:\mongodb\log

#. Create a configuration file for the :setting:`logpath` option for
   MongoDB in the :guilabel:`Command Shell` by issuing this command:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      echo logpath=C:\mongodb\log > C:\mongodb\mongod.cfg

While these optional steps are optional, using the configuration file,
and creating a specific location for log files are good practice.

.. note::

   Also consider setting the :setting:`logappend` option, otherwise,
   :program:`mongod.exe` will delete the contents of the existing log
   file when starting.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      The default :setting:`logpath` and :setting:`logappend` behavior will change in the 2.2 release.

Install and Run the MongoDB Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run all of the following commands in :guilabel:`Command Shell` with
"Administrative Privileges:"

#. To install the MongoDB service:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --config C:\mongodb\mongod.cfg --install

   Modify the path to the ``mongod.cfg`` file as needed. For the
   ``--install`` option to succeed, you *must* specify a 
   :setting:`logpath` setting or the :option:`--logpath <mongod --logpath>` 
   run-time option.

   .. TODO fix --install link once mongod.exe manual page exists.
   
#. To run the MongoDB Service:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      net start MongoDB

Stop or Remove the MongoDB Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- To stop MongoDB Service:

  .. code-block:: powershell

     net stop MongoDB

- To remove MongoDB Service:

  .. code-block:: powershell

     C:\mongodb\bin\mongod.exe --remove
