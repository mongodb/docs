If you use the :manual:`standard connection string format
</reference/connection-string#connections-standard-connection-string-format>`
rather than the |dns| seedlist format, removing an entire region from an

To verify the correct connection string after deploying the changes:

1. Click :guilabel:`Databases` in the top-left corner of |service|. 
 
#. Click :guilabel:`Connect` from the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view.
