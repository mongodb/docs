  {{operation}} ensures that the data files are safe to copy
  using low-level backup utilities such as ``cp``, ``scp``, or
  ``tar``. A :binary:`~bin.mongod` started using the copied
  files contains user-written data that is indistinguishable from the 
  user-written data on the locked :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

  The data files of a locked :binary:`~bin.mongod` may change due to
  operations such as :ref:`journaling syncs <journal-process>` or
  :ref:`WiredTiger snapshots <storage-wiredtiger-checkpoints>`.  While
  this has no effect on the logical data (e.g. data accessed by
  clients), some backup utilities may detect these changes and emit
  warnings or fail with errors. For more information on MongoDB-
  recommended backup utilities and procedures, see
  :doc:`/core/backups/`.

   .. note::

      The {{cachesetting}} limits the size of the WiredTiger internal
      cache. The operating system uses the available free memory
      for filesystem cache, which allows the compressed MongoDB data
      files to stay in memory. In addition, the operating system 
      uses any free RAM to buffer file system blocks and file system
      cache.

      To accommodate the additional consumers of RAM, you may have to
      decrease WiredTiger internal cache size.

   The default WiredTiger internal cache size value assumes that there is a
   single :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance per machine. If a single machine
   contains multiple MongoDB instances, decrease the setting to accommodate
   the other :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

   If you run :binary:`~bin.mongod` in a container (for example, ``lxc``,
   ``cgroups``, Docker, etc.) that does *not* have access to all of the
   RAM available in a system, you must set {{cachesetting}} or {{cachesettingalt}} 
   to a value less than the amount of RAM available in the container. The exact
   amount depends on the other processes running in the container. See
   :data:`~hostInfo.system.memLimitMB`.
   
   You can only provide one of either {{cachesetting}} or
   {{cachesettingalt}}.

ref: _wt-cache-default-values

   Avoid increasing the WiredTiger internal cache size above its
   default value. If your use case requires to do so, you can use
   {{cachesetting}} to specify a percentage of up to 80% of available
   memory. Values can range from 0.256GB to 10000GB.
