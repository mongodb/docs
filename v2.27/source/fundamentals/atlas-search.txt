Overview
--------

In this guide you can learn how to use the ``Search`` builder to build a ``$search``
aggregation pipeline stage with the {+driver-long+}.

To learn more about the ``$search`` pipeline stage, see :manual:`$search
</reference/operator/aggregation/search/>`.

.. note:: Only Available on Atlas for MongoDB v4.2 and Later

   The ``$search`` aggregation-pipeline operator is available only for collections hosted
   on :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas </>` clusters running MongoDB v4.2 or later that are
   covered by an :atlas:`Atlas search index </reference/atlas-search/index-definitions/>`.
   To learn more about the required setup and the functionality of this operator,
   see the :ref:`Atlas Search <fts-top-ref>` documentation.

The examples in this guide use the following documents in a collection called
``guitars``:

.. code-block:: json
 
   { "_id": 1, "make": "Fender", "description": "Classic guitars known for their versatility.", "establishedYear": 1946, "in_stock": true, "rating": 9 }
   { "_id": 2, "make": "Gibson", "description": "Classic guitars known for their rich, full tones.", "establishedYear": 1902, "in_stock": true, "rating": 8 }
   { "_id": 3, "make": "PRS", "description": "High-end guitars known for their quality.", "establishedYear": 1985, "in_stock": true, "rating": 9 }
   { "_id": 4, "make": "Kiesel", "description": "Quality guitars made only for custom orders.", "establishedYear": 2015, "in_stock": false }
   { "_id": 5, "make": "Ibanez", "description": "Well-crafted guitars used by many professional guitarists.", "establishedYear": 1957, "in_stock": true, "rating": 7 }
   { "_id": 6, "make": "Strandberg", "description": "Modern guitars known for their headless models.", "establishedYear": 1982, "in_stock": false }

The following ``Guitar`` class models the documents in this collection.

.. code-block:: csharp

   public class Guitar
   {
       public int Id { get; set; }
       public string Make { get; set; }
       public List<string> Models { get; set; }
       public int EstablishedYear { get; set; }
       [BsonElement("in_stock")]
       public bool InStock { get; set; }
       public int? Rating { get; set; }
   }

.. note::

   The documents in the ``guitars`` collection use the camel-case naming
   convention. The examples in this guide use a ``ConventionPack``
   to deserialize the fields in the collection into Pascal case and map them to
   the properties in the ``Guitar`` class.

   To learn more about custom serialization, see :ref:`csharp-custom-serialization`.

Create an Atlas Search Index
----------------------------

Before you can perform a search on an Atlas collection, you must first create an **Atlas
Search index** on the collection. An Atlas Search index is a data structure that
categorizes data in a searchable format. 

To learn how to create an Atlas Search Index see the
:atlas:`Create an Atlas Search Index </atlas-search/create-index>` Atlas guide.

Atlas Search Operators
----------------------

The ``Search`` class contains methods you can use to perform ``$search``
operations. For a full list of available ``$search`` operators, see the :atlas:`Operators and Collectors
</atlas-search/operators-and-collectors>` Atlas guide.

Autocomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``Autocomplete()`` method to search for a word or phrase that contains a
sequence of characters from an incomplete input string.

The following example performs an autocomplete query on the ``make``
field for text that starts with the string ``"Gib"``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-autocomplete-search
   :end-before: // end-autocomplete-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

.. note:: Index for Autocomplete Queries
   
   You must create an Atlas Search index that supports autocompletion
   to successfully perform autocomplete queries. To learn more, see
   :atlas:`How to Index Fields for Autocompletion </atlas-search/field-types/autocomplete-type/>`
   in the Atlas documentation.

   After you create the Atlas Search index, you must pass the index name to
   the ``Autocomplete()`` method, as shown in the preceding code.

The search returns the following document:

.. code-block:: json

    { "_id" : 2, "make" : "Gibson", "description" : "Classic guitars known for their rich, full tones.", "establishedYear" : 1902, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 8 }

To learn more about the ``autocomplete`` operator, see the :atlas:`autocomplete </atlas-search/autocomplete>` 
Atlas guide.

Compound
~~~~~~~~

Use the ``Compound()`` method to combine two or more operators into a single
search.

The following example searches the ``guitars`` collection for any documents
that match all of the following criteria:

- The ``rating`` field exists on the document
- The ``in_stock`` field is not ``false``
- The ``establishedYear`` field has a value greater than 1940

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-compound-search
   :end-before: // end-compound-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 1, "make" : "Fender", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1946, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 3, "make" : "PRS", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1985, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 5, "make" : "Ibanez", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1957, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 7 }

To learn more about the ``compound`` operator, see the :atlas:`compound </atlas-search/compound>` 
Atlas guide.

EmbeddedDocument
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``EmbeddedDocument()`` method to perform search operations on documents
within a field's array value.

.. note::

   To search on embedded documents, you must create an 
   ``embeddedDocument`` index on the array field.

   To learn how to define an ``embeddedDocument`` index, see
   :atlas:`Define the Index for the embeddedDocument Type
   </atlas-search/field-types/embedded-documents-type/#define-the-index-for-the-fts-field-type-type>`
   in the Atlas documentation.

Consider that some documents in the ``guitars`` collection have added a
``productDetails`` field that holds an array of product detail objects:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": 1, "make": "Fender", "description": "...", "establishedYear": 1946, "in_stock": true, "rating": 9, "productDetails": [{"product_id": 1234, "serial": "YZ5678"}] }
   { "_id": 2, "make": "Gibson", "description": "...", "establishedYear": 1902, "in_stock": true, "rating": 8 }
   { "_id": 3, "make": "PRS", "description": "...", "establishedYear": 1985, "in_stock": true, "rating": 9, "productDetails": [{"product_id": 9870, "serial": "AB5555"}] }
   { "_id": 4, "make": "Kiesel", "description": "...", "establishedYear": 2015, "in_stock": false }
   { "_id": 5, "make": "Ibanez", "description": "...", "establishedYear": 1957, "in_stock": true, "rating": 7, "productDetails": [{"product_id": 5432, "serial": "ZZ1234"}] }
   { "_id": 6, "make": "Strandberg", "description": "...", "establishedYear": 1982, "in_stock": false }

After creating an ``embeddedDocument`` index on the ``productDetails`` field,
you can perform Atlas search operations on documents in that field. The
following example performs a text search on the ``productDetails`` array fields
and returns any documents with a ``serial`` field value of ``"YZ5678"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-embedded-search
   :end-before: // end-embedded-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 1, "make" : "Fender", "description" : "Classic guitars known for their versatility.", "establishedYear" : 1946, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9, "productDetails" : [{ "product_id" : 1234, "serial" : "YZ5678" }] }

To learn more about the ``embeddedDocument`` operator, see the
:atlas:`embeddedDocument </atlas-search/embedded-document/>` Atlas guide.

Equals
~~~~~~

Use the ``Equals()`` method to check whether a field matches a specified
value.

The following example searches the ``guitars`` collection for any documents in
which the value of the ``in_stock`` field is ``true``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-equals-search
   :end-before: // end-equals-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 1, "make" : "Fender", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1946, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 2, "make" : "Gibson", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1902, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 8 }
   { "_id" : 3, "make" : "PRS", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1985, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 5, "make" : "Ibanez", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1957, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 7 }


To learn more about the ``equals`` operator, see the :atlas:`equals </atlas-search/equals>` 
Atlas guide.

Exists
~~~~~~

Use the ``Exists()`` method to search for documents in which a specified indexed
field name exists. If the specified field exists but is not indexed, the
document is not included with the result set.

The following example searches the ``guitars`` collection for any documents in
which the ``rating`` field exists.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-exists-search
   :end-before: // end-exists-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 1, "make" : "Fender", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1946, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 2, "make" : "Gibson", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1902, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 8 }
   { "_id" : 3, "make" : "PRS", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1985, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 5, "make" : "Ibanez", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1957, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 7 }


To learn more about the ``exists`` operator, see the :atlas:`exists </atlas-search/exists>` 
Atlas guide.

GeoShape
~~~~~~~~

Use the ``GeoShape()`` method to search for documents in relation to a given
geometry. When specifying the coordinates to search, longitude must be specified
first, followed by latitude. Longitude values can be between ``-180`` and
``180``, inclusive. Latitude values can be between ``-90`` and ``90``,
inclusive.

.. include:: /includes/atlas-search-support-note.rst

Consider some documents in the ``guitars`` collection have added an
``in_stock_location`` field. The changed documents in the collection now look as
follows:

.. code-block:: json
 
   { "_id": 1, "make": "Fender", "description": "...", "establishedYear": 1946, "in_stock": true, "in_stock_location":  { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -73.93615, 40.69791 ]}, "rating": 9 }
   { "_id": 2, "make": "Gibson", "description": "...", "establishedYear": 1902, "in_stock": true, "in_stock_location":  { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 47.6062, 122.321 ]}, "rating": 8 }

The following example searches for all documents in which the
coordinates in the ``in_stock_location`` field intersect with a specified
polygon:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-geoshape-search
   :end-before: // end-geoshape-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 1, "make" : "Fender", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1946, "in_stock" : true, "in_stock_location" : { "type" : "Point", "coordinates" : ["-73.93615", "40.69791"] }, "rating" : 9 }

To learn more about the ``geoShape`` operator, see the :atlas:`geoShape </atlas-search/geoShape>` 
Atlas guide.

GeoWithin
~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``GeoWithin()`` method to search for documents in which the coordinates of
their specified :manual:`GeoJSON </reference/geojson/>` field are within a given
geometry. You can search for points that are within a:

- Circle
- Bounding box
- Polygon

When specifying the coordinates to search, longitude must be specified
first, followed by latitude. Longitude values can be between ``-180`` and
``180``, inclusive. Latitude values can be between ``-90`` and ``90``,
inclusive.

.. include:: /includes/atlas-search-support-note.rst

Consider some documents in the ``guitars`` collection have added an
``in_stock_location`` field. The changed documents in the collection now look as
follows:

.. code-block:: json
 
   { "_id": 1, "make": "Fender", "description": "...", "establishedYear": 1946, "in_stock": true, "in_stock_location":  { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -73.93615, 40.69791 ]}, "rating": 9 }
   { "_id": 2, "make": "Gibson", "description": "...", "establishedYear": 1902, "in_stock": true, "in_stock_location":  { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 47.6062, 122.321 ]}, "rating": 8 }

The following example searches for all documents in which the
coordinates in the ``in_stock_location`` field falls within a specified
polygon: 

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-geowithin-search
   :end-before: // end-geowithin-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 1, "make" : "Fender", "description" : "Classic guitars known for their versatility.", "establishedYear" : 1946, "in_stock" : true, "in_stock_location" : { "type" : "Point", "coordinates" : ["-73.93615", "40.69791"] }, "rating" : 9 }

To learn more about the ``geoWithin`` operator, see the :atlas:`geoWithin </atlas-search/geoWithin>` 
Atlas guide.

In
~~

Use the ``In()`` method to search for documents with field values that match a list
of specified values.

The following example searches the ``guitars`` collection for documents that have a
``make`` field value of either ``"Fender"`` or ``"Gibson"``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: start-in-search
   :end-before: end-in-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": 1, "make": "Fender", "description": "...", "establishedYear": 1946, "in_stock": true, "rating": 9 }
   { "_id": 2, "make": "Gibson", "description": "...", "establishedYear": 1902, "in_stock": true, "rating": 8 }

MoreLikeThis
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``MoreLikeThis()`` method to search for documents that are similar to an
input document.

The following example searches the ``guitars`` collection for documents that are
similar to an object in which the value of the ``Description`` field is "high
quality."

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-morelikethis-search
   :end-before: // end-morelikethis-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 3, "make" : "PRS", "description" : "High-end guitars known for their quality.", "establishedYear" : 1985, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 4, "make" : "Kiesel", "description" : "Quality guitars made only for custom orders.", "establishedYear" : 2015, "in_stock" : false, "rating" : null }


To learn more about the ``moreLikeThis`` operator, see the :atlas:`moreLikeThis </atlas-search/morelikethis>` 
Atlas guide.

Near
~~~~

Use the ``Near()`` method to search for documents in which a specified field is
near a given value. You can perform the search on:

- A number field
- A date field
- A geographic point

The following example searches the ``guitars`` collection for documents in which
the value of the ``rating`` field is near ``9``. The documents are returned in
order based on how close the value is to the number ``9``.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-near-search
   :end-before: // end-near-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 1, "make" : "Fender", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1946, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 3, "make" : "PRS", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1985, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 2, "make" : "Gibson", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1902, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 8 }
   { "_id" : 5, "make" : "Ibanez", "description" : "...", "establishedYear" : 1957, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 7 }


To learn more about the ``near`` operator, see the :atlas:`near </atlas-search/near>` 
Atlas guide.

Phrase
~~~~~~

Use the ``Phrase()`` method to search for documents in which a specified field
contains an input string.

The following example searches the ``guitars`` collection for documents in which
the ``description`` field contains the phrase "classic guitars."

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-phrase-search
   :end-before: // end-phrase-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 1, "make" : "Fender", "description" : "Classic guitars known for their versatility.", "establishedYear" : 1946, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 2, "make" : "Gibson", "description" : "Classic guitars known for their rich, full tones.", "establishedYear" : 1902, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 8 }

You can also search the collection for documents that match multiple separate
phrases as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-multiphrase-search
   :end-before: // end-multiphrase-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

This search returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 1, "make" : "Fender", "description" : "Classic guitars known for their versatility.", "establishedYear" : 1946, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 4, "make" : "Kiesel", "description" : "Quality guitars made only for custom orders.", "establishedYear" : 2015, "in_stock" : false, "rating" : null }
   { "_id" : 2, "make" : "Gibson", "description" : "Classic guitars known for their rich, full tones.", "establishedYear" : 1902, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 8 }

To learn more about the ``phrase`` operator, see the :atlas:`phrase </atlas-search/phrase>` 
Atlas guide.

QueryString
~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``QueryString()`` method to search for documents using a string with
the following operators and delimiters:

- ``AND``
- ``OR`` 
- ``NOT``
- ``()``

The following example searches the ``guitars`` collection for documents in which
the value of the ``description`` field matches each of the following criteria:

- Contains the string "classic" *or* the string "quality"
- Does not contain the string "custom"

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-querystring-search
   :end-before: // end-querystring-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 1, "make" : "Fender", "description" : "Classic guitars known for their versatility.", "establishedYear" : 1946, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 3, "make" : "PRS", "description" : "High-end guitars known for their quality.", "establishedYear" : 1985, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 2, "make" : "Gibson", "description" : "Classic guitars known for their rich, full tones.", "establishedYear" : 1902, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 8 }

To learn more about the ``queryString`` operator, see the :atlas:`queryString </atlas-search/queryString>` 
Atlas guide.

Range
~~~~~

Use the ``Range()`` method to search for documents in which the value of a
specified field falls within a given numeric or date range.

The following example searches the ``guitars`` collection for all documents with
an ``establishedYear`` value greater than 1980 and less than 2020.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-range-search
   :end-before: // end-range-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following results:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 3, "make" : "PRS", "description" : "High-end guitars known for their quality.", "establishedYear" : 1985, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 4, "make" : "Kiesel", "description" : "Quality guitars made only for custom orders.", "establishedYear" : 2015, "in_stock" : false, "rating" : null }
   { "_id" : 6, "make" : "Strandberg", "description" : "Modern guitars known for their headless models.", "establishedYear" : 1982, "in_stock" : false, "rating" : null }

To learn more about the ``range`` operator, see the :atlas:`range </atlas-search/range>` 
Atlas guide.

Regex
~~~~~

Use the ``Regex()`` method to search for documents using a regular expression.

The following example searches the ``guitars`` collection for documents in which
the value of the ``make`` field contains exactly six letters.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-regex-search
   :end-before: // end-regex-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following results:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 1, "make" : "Fender", "description" : "Classic guitars known for their versatility.", "establishedYear" : 1946, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 9 }
   { "_id" : 2, "make" : "Gibson", "description" : "Classic guitars known for their rich, full tones.", "establishedYear" : 1902, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 8 }
   { "_id" : 4, "make" : "Kiesel", "description" : "Quality guitars made only for custom orders.", "establishedYear" : 2015, "in_stock" : false, "rating" : null }
   { "_id" : 5, "make" : "Ibanez", "description" : "Well-crafted guitars used by many professional guitarists.", "establishedYear" : 1957, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 7 }

.. note::

   By default the ``regex`` operator cannot run on an analyzed field. You can
   allow it to run on an analyzed field by setting ``allowAnalyzedField`` option
   to true, as follows:

   .. code-block:: csharp

      var result = guitarsCollection.Aggregate()
       .Search(Builders<Guitar>.Search.Regex(g => g.Make, regex, true))
       .ToList();

   Setting the ``allowAnalyzedField`` option to true may lead to unexpected
   search results. To learn more, see :atlas:`regex Behavior
   </atlas-search/regex/#behavior>`.

To learn more about the ``regex`` operator, see the :atlas:`regex </atlas-search/regex>` 
Atlas guide.

Span
~~~~

Use the ``Span()`` method to search for text search matches within regions of a
field. You can use this method to find strings which are near each other to
specified degrees of precision.

.. note::

   The ``span`` operator is more computationally intensive than other operators
   because queries must keep track of positional information.

The following example searches the ``guitars`` collection for documents in which
the value of the ``description`` field contains the strings "guitars" and
"quality" within one word of each other.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-span-search
   :end-before: // end-span-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 4, "make" : "Kiesel", "description" : "Quality guitars made only for custom orders.", "establishedYear" : 2015, "in_stock" : false, "rating" : null }

Although the document with ``_id: 3`` contains the strings "guitars" and
"quality", they are separated by more than one word, so the search omits this
document from the results.

To learn more about the ``span`` operator, see the :atlas:`span </atlas-search/span>` 
Atlas guide.

Text
~~~~

Use the ``Text()`` method to search a document for a given string or array of
strings. If there are multiple terms in a given string, Atlas Search also looks
for a match for each term in the string separately.

The following example searches the ``guitars`` collection for documents in which
the value of the ``description`` field contains the string "used by
professionals".

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-text-search
   :end-before: // end-text-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 5, "make" : "Ibanez", "description" : "Well-crafted guitars used by many professional guitarists.", "establishedYear" : 1957, "in_stock" : true, "rating" : 7 }

.. tip::

   If your search string contains multiple terms, the method also looks for a match
   for each term in the string separately.

To learn more about the ``text`` operator, see the :atlas:`text </atlas-search/text>` 
Atlas guide.

Wildcard
~~~~~~~~

Use the ``Wildcard()`` method to search for documents using special characters in
your search string that can match any character. You can use the following
characters in your search:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Character
     - Description
   
   * - ``?``
     - Matches any single character

   * - ``*``
     - Matches 0 or more characters

   * - ``\``
     - Escape character

The following example searches for documents in which the value of the ``make``
field contains the string "Strand" followed by any other characters.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-examples/atlas-search/AtlasSearchExamples.cs
   :start-after: // start-wildcard-search
   :end-before: // end-wildcard-search
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

The search returns the following document:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id" : 6, "make" : "Strandberg", "description" : "Modern guitars known for their headless models.", "establishedYear" : 1982, "in_stock" : false, "rating" : null }

.. note::

   By default the ``wildcard`` operator cannot run on an analyzed field. You can
   allow it to run on an analyzed field by setting ``allowAnalyzedField`` option
   to true, as follows:

   .. code-block:: csharp

      var result =  guitarsCollection.Aggregate()
       .Search(Builders<Guitar>.Search.Wildcard(g => g.Make, "Strand*", true))
       .ToList();

   Setting the ``allowAnalyzedField`` option to true may lead to unexpected
   search results. To learn more, see :atlas:`wildcard Behavior
   </atlas-search/wildcard/#behavior>`.
