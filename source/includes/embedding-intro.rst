As a dashboard :ref:`Author <dashboard-permissions>`, you can allow your
charts to be embedded in external websites or shared via links. You can
either:

- Embed an :ref:`unauthenticated chart <anon-embedding-charts>` which is
  viewable by anyone, or
  
- Embed a chart which requires users to authenticate through an
  :ref:`Embedding Authentication Provider <configure-auth-providers>`.
