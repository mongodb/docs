Review Index Ranking

The :manual:`indexes </indexes>` suggested by the |pa| are ordered by
their respective :guilabel:`Impact` scores. :guilabel:`Impact` indicates
the estimated performance improvement that the suggested index would
bring.

How |pa| Suggests and Ranks Indexes
-----------------------------------

.. _query-shape-metrics:

The |pa| monitors queries that take longer than ``100`` milliseconds to
execute and groups these queries into common :term:`query shapes <query
shape>`. The |pa| calculates the inefficiency of each query shape by
considering the following aggregated metrics from queries which match
the shape:

- Amount of time spent executing the query.

- Number of documents scanned.

- Number of documents returned.

To establish recommended indexes, the |pa| uses these metrics in a
formula to calculate the :guilabel:`Impact`, or performance improvement
that creating an index matching that query shape would cause. The |pa|
compares the amount of time spent executing index-specific operations to
the total operational latency in the deployment. When the |pa| suggests
indexes, the indexes are ranked by their :guilabel:`Impact` score.

Index Field Order
-----------------

The type of query operation in the query shape affects the order of the
fields used to construct the index. In general, fields are ranked by
their :term:`cardinality`.

The following table shows how the |pa| ranks various operation types by
order of relative importance:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 20

   * - Rank
     - Operation Type
     - Example Operator

   * - 1
     - Equality match
     - :query:`$eq`

   * - 2
     - Array query
     - :query:`$in`

   * - 3
     - Range query
     - :query:`$gte`

   * - 4
     - Type query
     - :query:`$type`

   * - 5
     - Exists
     - :query:`$exists`

   * - 6
     - All other operators
     - :query:`$nearSphere`

   * - 7
     - Sort
     - :manual:`sort() </reference/method/cursor.sort/>`

Limiting Proposed Indexes
-------------------------

The |pa| does not suggest indexes which:

- Have more than 16 fields, and/or

- Contain ``_id`` as a field key.

Additionally, the |pa| only suggests the index if:

- For impacted queries, the difference between scanned documents and
  returned documents is greater than 500, and

- At least 60 seconds cumulatively were spent executing impacted
  queries over the past 24 hours.

Index De-Duplication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |pa| de-duplicates overlapping indexes before making suggestions.
For example, consider if the |pa| calculates the following potential
suggested indexes:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { a : 1 }
   { a : 1, b : 1 }

Since ``{ a : 1 }`` is a prefix of ``{ a : 1, b : 1 }``, |pa| only
suggests ``{ a : 1, b : 1 }``. For more information on index prefixes,
see :manual:`Prefixes </core/index-compound/#prefixes>`.

Example: New York City Taxi Data
--------------------------------

This example uses a database named ``cab-db`` containing information about
New York City taxi rides, with fields for the times of pickup and dropoff,
ride distance, and a breakdown of ride costs. A typical document in the
collection ``yellow`` looks like this:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
    	"_id" : ObjectId("5db9daab0b2a17b7706cd6a3"),
    	"pickup_datetime" : "2014-06-30 02:09:23",
    	"dropoff_datetime" : "2014-06-30 02:20:36",
    	"passenger_count" : 2,
    	"trip_distance" : 3,
    	"fare_amount" : 12,
    	"tip_amount" : 2.6,
    	"total_amount" : 15.6
   }

The collection contains more than 10 million documents, so an application
which needs to run queries based on specific field data is going to generate
some very inefficient operations unless the collection is properly indexed.

Typical queries for this application search for documents which contain
a specific dropoff time, combined with one or more other fields. For
example:

.. _taxi-example-query:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   db.yellow.find({ "dropoff_datetime": "2014-06-19 21:45:00",
                    "passenger_count": 1,
                    "trip_distance": {"$gt": 3 }
                  })

The |pa| recommends the following indexes to improve performance:

.. figure:: /images/suggested-indexes.png
   :figwidth: 700px
   :alt: Screen shot of suggested indexes

.. note::

   By default, the |pa| shows index recommendations for all collections
   in your cluster. To narrow the recommendations down to a specific
   collection, select one from the :guilabel:`Collection` dropdown
   menu.

The recommended indexes are listed in order of performance impact, from
greatest to least. In this example, the first recommended index is
estimated to decrease overall cluster operation latency time by 50%.

The first recommendation is for an index on three fields:

- ``passenger_count``
- ``dropoff_datetime``
- ``trip_distance``

Click the :guilabel:`Create Index` button to create the index with
any desired additional options. To learn more about creating an index
in the Performance Advisor, see :ref:`pa-create-suggested-indexes`.

Creating this index improves performance by removing the need for the
database engine to scan the entire collection to find documents which
match the query. Queries with the shape shown in the :ref:`example
<taxi-example-query>` return results in 50 milliseconds or less on the
indexed collection, as opposed to several seconds on the unindexed
collection.

.. note::

   You can also create indexes with the :ref:`Data
   Explorer <data-explorer-indexes>`.
