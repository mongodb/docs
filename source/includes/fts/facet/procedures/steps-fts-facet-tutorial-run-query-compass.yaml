title: "Run an |fts| facet query that groups the genre and year fields
       into buckets."
content: |
  The query uses the following ``searchMeta`` operator clauses:
  
  .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-facet-constant-desc.rst 

  To run this query in |compass|:

  a. Click the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Select...`, then configure each of the following 
     pipeline stages by selecting the stage from the dropdown and adding
     the query for that stage. Click :guilabel:`Add Stage` to add 
     additional stages.

     You can run this query using :pipeline:`$searchMeta` or using
     :pipeline:`$search` with the ``SEARCH_META`` aggregation variable. 

     .. tabs:: 

        .. tab:: $searchMeta 
           :tabid: search-meta-pipeline

           .. include:: /includes/fts/facet/tutorial.rst

        .. tab:: $search with $$SEARCH_META 
           :tabid: search-meta-variable 

           .. include:: /includes/fts/facet/tutorial-variable.rst

  If you enabled :guilabel:`Auto Preview`, |compass| displays the 
  following documents next to the ``$set`` pipeline stage:
