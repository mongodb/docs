   If you plan to use live migration, do NOT choose :guilabel:`Latest 
   Version With Auto Upgrades` for your {+dedicated-clusters+}. This option auto 
   upgrades your {+cluster+} to the latest minor release. Live migration only 
   supports major releases and does not support minor releases, such as 
   MongoDB version 8.2.
