Replication Processes
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Members of a :term:`replica set` replicate data continuously. First,
members use *initial sync* to capture the data set. Then, every
:program:`mongod` instance keeps an :doc:`oplog
</core/replica-set-oplog>`, which is a :term:`capped collection`. to
support replication. The oplog records every operation that modifies
the data set.
