Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to change the way your {+sink-connector+} writes data to
MongoDB.

You can change how your connector writes data to MongoDB for use cases
including the following:

- Insert documents instead of upserting them
- Replace or update documents that match a filter other than the ``_id``
  field
- Delete documents that match a filter

You can configure how your connector writes data to MongoDB by specifying a
**write model strategy**. A write model strategy is a class that defines
how your sink connector should write data using **write models**. A write
model is a MongoDB Java driver interface that defines the
structure of a write operation.

To learn how to modify the sink records your connector receives before your
connector writes them to MongoDB, read the guide on
:ref:`Sink Connector Post Processors <sink-fundamentals-post-processors>`.

To see a write model strategy implementation, see the source code of the
:github:`InsertOneDefaultStrategy class
<mongodb/mongo-kafka/blob/master/src/main/java/com/mongodb/kafka/connect/sink/writemodel/strategy/InsertOneDefaultStrategy.java>`.

.. _sink-connector-bulk-write-ops:

Bulk Write Operations
---------------------

The sink connector writes data to MongoDB using bulk write operations.
Bulk writes group multiple write operations, such as inserts,
updates, or deletes, together. 

By default, the sink connector performs ordered bulk writes, which
guarantee the order of data changes. In an ordered bulk write, if any
write operation results in an error, the connector skips the remaining
writes in that batch.

If you don't need to guarantee the order of data changes, you can
set the ``bulk.write.ordered`` setting to ``false`` so that the
connector performs unordered bulk writes. The sink connector performs
unordered bulk writes in parallel, which can improve performance.

In addition, when you enable unordered bulk writes and set the
``errors.tolerance`` setting to ``all``, even if any write
operation in your bulk write fails, the connector continues to
perform the remaining write operations in the batch that do not return
errors.

.. tip::

   To learn more about the ``bulk.write.ordered`` setting, see the
   :ref:`Connector Message Processing Properties
   <sink-configuration-message-processing>`.
   
   To learn more about bulk write operations, see the following
   documentation:

   - :manual:`Server manual entry on ordered and unordered bulk operations </reference/method/Bulk/#ordered-and-unordered-bulk-operations>`.
   - `Bulk write operations in Java <{+connector_driver_url_base+}fundamentals/crud/write-operations/bulk/#order-of-execution>`__

How to Specify Write Model Strategies
-------------------------------------

To specify a write model strategy, use the following setting:

.. code-block:: properties

   writemodel.strategy=<write model strategy classname>

For a list of the pre-built write model strategies included in the connector,
see the guide on :ref:`write model strategy configurations <sink-connector-write-model-strategies>`.

.. _kafka-sink-business-key:

Specify a Business Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A business key is a value composed of one or more fields in your sink record
that identifies it as unique. By default, the sink connector uses the ``_id``
field of the sink record to retrieve the business key. To specify a
different business key, configure the Document Id Adder post processor to use
a custom value.

You can configure the Document Id Adder to set the ``_id`` field from the
sink record key as shown in the following example properties:

.. code-block:: properties

   document.id.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.PartialKeyStrategy
   document.id.strategy.partial.key.projection.list=<comma-separated field names>
   document.id.strategy.partial.key.projection.type=AllowList

Alternatively, you can configure it to set the ``_id`` field from the sink
record value as shown in the following example properties:

.. code-block:: properties

   document.id.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.PartialValueStrategy
   document.id.strategy.partial.value.projection.list=<comma-separated field names>
   document.id.strategy.partial.value.projection.type=AllowList

.. important:: Improve Write Performance

   Create a unique index in your target collection that corresponds to the
   fields of your business key. This improves the performance of write
   operations from your sink connector. See the guide on
   :manual:`unique indexes </core/index-unique>` for more information.

The following write model strategies require a business key:

- ``ReplaceOneBusinessKeyStrategy``
- ``DeleteOneBusinessKeyStrategy``
- ``UpdateOneBusinessKeyTimestampStrategy``

For more information on the Document Id Adder post processor, see
:ref:`<sink-post-processors-document-id-adder>`.

Examples
--------

This section shows examples of configuration and output of the following write
model strategies:

- :ref:`Update One Timestamps Strategy <kafka-sink-write-model-time-example>`
- :ref:`Replace One Business Key Strategy <kafka-sink-write-model-replace-example>`
- :ref:`Delete One Business Key Strategy <kafka-sink-write-model-delete-example>`

.. _kafka-sink-write-model-time-example:

Update One Timestamps Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the Update One Timestamps strategy to add and update
timestamps when writing documents to MongoDB. This strategy performs the
following actions:

* When the connector inserts a new MongoDB document, it sets the
  ``_insertedTS`` and ``_modifiedTS`` fields to the current time on the
  connector's server.

* When the connector updates an existing MongoDB document, it updates the
  ``_modifiedTS`` field to the current time on the connector's server.

Suppose you want to track the position of a train along a route, and your
sink connector receives messages with the following structure:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "_id": "MN-1234",
     "start": "Beacon",
     "destination": "Grand Central"
     "position": [ 40, -73 ]
   }

Use the ``ProvidedInValueStrategy`` to specify that your connector should use
the ``_id`` value of the message to assign the ``_id`` field in your MongoDB
document. Specify your id and write model strategy properties as follows:

.. code-block:: properties

   document.id.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.ProvidedInValueStrategy
   writemodel.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.writemodel.strategy.UpdateOneTimestampsStrategy

After your sink connector processes the preceding example record, it inserts a
document that contains the ``_insertedTS`` and ``_modifiedTS`` fields as shown
in the following document:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 3-4

   {
     "_id": "MN-1234",
     "_insertedTS": ISODate("2021-09-20T15:08:000Z"),
     "_modifiedTS": ISODate("2021-09-20T15:08:000Z"),
     "start": "Beacon",
     "destination": "Grand Central"
     "position": [ 40, -73 ]
   }

After one hour, the train reports its new location along its route with
a new position as shown in the following record:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 5

   {
     "_id": "MN-1234",
     "start": "Beacon",
     "destination": "Grand Central"
     "position": [ 42, -75 ]
   }

Once your sink connector processes the preceding record, it inserts a document
that contains the following data:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 4,7

   {
     "_id": "MN-1234",
     "_insertedTS": ISODate("2021-09-20T15:08:000Z"),
     "_modifiedTS": ISODate("2021-09-20T16:08:000Z"),
     "start": "Beacon",
     "destination": "Grand Central"
     "position": [ 42, -75 ]
   }

For more information on the ``ProvidedInValueStrategy``, see the section
on how to :ref:`Configure the Document Id Adder Post Processor <sink-post-processors-document-id-adder>`.

.. _kafka-sink-write-model-replace-example:

Replace One Business Key Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the Replace One Business Key strategy to replace documents
that match the value of the business key. To define a business key on
multiple fields of a record and configure the connector to replace
documents that contain matching business keys, perform the following
tasks:

#. Create a :manual:`unique index </core/index-unique>` in your collection
   that corresponds to your business key fields.
#. Specify the ``PartialValueStrategy`` id strategy to identify the
   fields that belong to the business key in the connector configuration.
#. Specify the ``ReplaceOneBusinessKeyStrategy`` write model strategy in the
   connector configuration.

Suppose you want to track airplane capacity by the flight number and airport
location represented by ``flight_no`` and ``airport_code``, respectively. An
example message contains the following information:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "flight_no": "Z342",
     "airport_code": "LAX",
     "seats": {
       "capacity": 180,
       "occupied": 152
     }
   }

To implement the strategy, using ``flight_no`` and ``airport_code`` as the
business key, first create a unique index on these fields in the MongoDB
shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.createIndex({ "flight_no": 1, "airport_code": 1}, { unique: true })

Next, specify the ``PartialValueStrategy`` strategy and business key
fields in the a projection list. Specify the id and write model strategy
configuration as follows:

.. code-block:: properties

   document.id.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.PartialValueStrategy
   document.id.strategy.partial.value.projection.list=flight_no,airport_code
   document.id.strategy.partial.value.projection.type=AllowList
   writemodel.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.writemodel.strategy.ReplaceOneBusinessKeyStrategy

The sample data inserted into the collection contains the following:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 1,2

   {
     "flight_no": "Z342"
     "airport_code": "LAX",
     "seats": {
       "capacity": 180,
       "occupied": 152
     }
   }

When the connector processes sink data that matches the business key of
the existing document, it replaces the document with the new values
without changing the business key fields:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   {
     "flight_no": "Z342"
     "airport_code": "LAX",
     "status": "canceled"
   }

After the connector processes the sink data, it replaces the original sample
document in MongoDB with the preceding one.

.. _kafka-sink-write-model-delete-example:

Delete One Business Key Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the connector to remove a document when it receives
messages that match a business key using the Delete One Business Key
strategy. To set a business key from multiple fields of a record and
configure the connector to delete a document that contains a matching
business key, perform the following tasks:

#. Create a :manual:`unique index </core/index-unique>` in your MongoDB
   collection that corresponds to your business key fields.
#. Specify the ``PartialValueStrategy`` as the id strategy to identify the
   fields that belong to the business key in the connector configuration.
#. Specify the ``DeleteOneBusinessKeyStrategy`` write model strategy in the
   connector configuration.

Suppose you want to delete a calendar event from a specific year from
a collection that contains a document that resembles the following:

.. _delete-one-business-key-sample-document:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     "year": 2005,
     "month": 3,
     "day": 15,
     "event": "Dentist Appointment"
   }

To implement the strategy, using ``year`` as the business key, first create
a unique index on these fields in the MongoDB shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.createIndex({ "year": 1 }, { unique: true })

Next, specify your business key and write model strategy in your
configuration as follows:

.. code-block:: properties

   document.id.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.processor.id.strategy.PartialValueStrategy
   document.id.strategy.partial.value.projection.list=year
   document.id.strategy.partial.value.projection.type=AllowList
   writemodel.strategy=com.mongodb.kafka.connect.sink.writemodel.strategy.DeleteOneBusinessKeyStrategy

If your connector processes a sink record that contains the business key
``year``, it deletes the first document with a matching field value
returned by MongoDB. Suppose your connector processes a sink record that
contains the following value data:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "year": 2005,
     ...
   }

When the connector processes the preceding record, it deletes the first
document from the collection that contains a ``year`` field with a value of
"2005" such as the original
:ref:`"Dentist Appointment" sample document <delete-one-business-key-sample-document>`.

.. _kafka-sink-write-model-create-custom-strategy:

Custom Write Model Strategies
-----------------------------

If none of the write model strategies included with the connector fit your use
case, you can create your own.

A write model strategy is a Java class that implements the
``WriteModelStrategy`` interface and must override the ``createWriteModel()``
method.

See the
:github:`source code for the WriteModelStrategy interface <mongodb/mongo-kafka/blob/{+connector_version_github_tag+}/src/main/java/com/mongodb/kafka/connect/sink/writemodel/strategy/WriteModelStrategy.java>`
for the required method signature.

Sample Write Model Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following custom write model strategy returns a write operation that
replaces a MongoDB document that matches the ``_id`` field of your sink
record with the value of the ``fullDocument`` field of your sink record:

.. code-block:: java

   /**
    * Custom write model strategy
    *
    * This class reads the 'fullDocument' field from a change stream and
    * returns a ReplaceOne operation.
    */

   public class CustomWriteModelStrategy implements WriteModelStrategy {

     private static String ID = "_id";
     @Override
     public WriteModel<BsonDocument> createWriteModel(final SinkDocument document) {
       BsonDocument changeStreamDocument = document.getValueDoc()
           .orElseThrow(() -> new DataException("Missing value document"));

       BsonDocument fullDocument = changeStreamDocument.getDocument("fullDocument", new BsonDocument());
       if (fullDocument.isEmpty()) {
         return null; // Return null to indicate no op.
       }

       return new ReplaceOneModel<>(Filters.eq(ID, fullDocument.get(ID)), fullDocument);
     }
   }

For another example of a custom write model strategy, see the
:github:`UpsertAsPartOfDocumentStrategy <mongodb-university/kafka-edu/blob/main/custom-write-strategy-example/src/main/java/custom/writestrategy/UpsertAsPartOfDocumentStrategy.java>`
example strategy on GitHub.

How to Install Your Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure your sink connector to use a custom write strategy, you must
complete the following actions:

1. Compile the custom write strategy class to a JAR file.

#. Add the compiled JAR to the classpath/plugin path for your Kafka workers.
   For more information about plugin paths, see the
   `Confluent documentation <https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/managing/community.html>`__.

   .. note::

      Kafka Connect loads plugins in isolation. When you deploy a custom write
      strategy, both the connector JAR and the write model strategy
      JAR must be on the same path. Your paths should resemble the following:

      | ``<plugin.path>/mongo-kafka-connect/mongo-kafka-connect-all.jar``
      | ``<plugin.path>/mongo-kafka-connect/custom-write-model-strategy.jar``

      To learn more about {+kafka-connect+} plugins, see
      `this guide from Confluent <https://docs.confluent.io/home/connect/userguide.html#installing-kconnect-plugins>`__.

#. Specify your custom class in the
   :ref:`writemodel.strategy <sink-configuration-post-processors>`
   configuration setting.

To learn how to compile a class to a JAR file, see the
`JAR deployment guide <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/build.html>`__
from the Java SE documentation.
