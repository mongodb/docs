Back Up |onprem|
================

Deploying the |onprem| Backup Blockstore and Application databases as
:term:`replica sets <replica-set>` is key to protect the databases from failure.
Ensure you configure and deploy your replica sets for
failover and redundancy. See :manual:`Replica Set High Availability
</core/replica-set-high-availability>` and :manual:`Replica Set
Deployment Architectures </core/replica-set-architectures>` for more
about replica set architecture.

Beyond using MongoDB's replication capabilities, you can create
backups for the Backup Blockstore database and Application database,
both for longterm storage of snapshots, and for backing
up |onprem| for disaster recovery purposes.

To restore |onprem|, you only need backups of the Application database
and the Backup Blockstore database. |onprem|'s other components are
stateless: you can rebuild them from the installation packages if need
be.

.. important::

   Your |backup| installation cannot back up |onprem|. If you wish to
   use |onprem| to back up |onprem|, you will need *two* |onprem|
   installations: one to back up your MongoDB deployment,
   and anotehr to back up your |onprem| databases.

Back Up with the Public API
---------------------------

The |mms| Public API provides the ability to programmatically restore
snapshots on your desired schedule, and store them offline. Ideally,
you should save the backups to a tape drive, appending the new
snapshots daily until the drive is full, and then store the drive offsite.

Programatically restoring snapshots has the same impact on the Backup
Blockstore database as a typical restore.

You can then :ref:`restore your MongoDB instance from the stored
snapshots </tutorial/restore-from-snapshot>`. 

This method backs up the snapshots only: you **cannot** use the
backups to restore |onprem| in the event that the Blockstore 
is lost.

Shut Down and Back Up
---------------------

You can perform a full backup of all snapshots contained in |onprem|,
as well as the point-in-time restores that Backup stores by shutting
down |onprem| and all of the hosts monitored and backed up by
|onprem|, and then backing up their file systems while they're offline.

The 'Shut Down and Back Up' approach has the advantage of providing all
of |onprem|'s backup snap shots **as well as** the point-in-time
restores that it stores. However, the process involves significant
downtime and during the shut down, |onprem| is completely unavailable.
As such, if a failure occurs in one of your MongoDB instances, you may
lose the data that was not backed up by |onprem| prior to the shutdown.

Online Backup
-------------

Online backup is the riskiest option, as it involves backing up
the databses while |onprem| is running. If done correctly, this provides
you with all of the backup snapshots contained in |onprem|, as well as
the point-in-time restores for the period leading up to the backup.

However, the process is complex and there is high potential for errors.
To perform the online backup, you must run ``fsyncLock`` on each
:program:`mongod` process that is part of the Application and Backup
Blockstore replica sets in the correct order, back up the underlying
file system, and then call ``fsyncUnlock``. If you forget to call
``fsyncUnlock`` on a :program:`mongod` instance, you risk significant
long-term problems and failures.
