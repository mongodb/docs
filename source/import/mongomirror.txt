|mongomirror| is a tool for manually migrating data from an existing
MongoDB replica set to a MongoDB |service| replica set.
|mongomirror| does not require you to shut down your existing
replica set or applications, and does not import user or role data
or copy the ``config`` database.

Upgrade Path

Download ``mongomirror``
------------------------

.. note::

   On macOS 64-bit, a security alert appears when you first try to open
   the ``mongomirror`` file after you have downloaded it. To proceed,
   see `Open an app by overriding security settings
   <https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-an-app-by-overriding-security-settings-mh40617/12.0/mac/12.0>`__.

Prerequisites
-------------

Source MongoDB Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The source MongoDB deployment must be a replica set. If the
  source is a standalone MongoDB deployment, before running
  |mongomirror|, :manual:`convert the standalone to a replica set
  </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/>`.

- The source replica set must run MongoDB version 2.6 or higher.

- The source MongoDB replica set cannot be an
  ``M0`` {+free-cluster+} or ``M2/M5`` shared cluster.

- Don't change the ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` flag
  at any time during the procedure.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-migrate-drop-geoHaystack.rst

- .. include:: /includes/fact-mongomirror-ttl-indexes.rst

- .. include:: /includes/fact-mongomirror-namespace-changes.rst

- You can't use the 
  :dbcommand:`renameCollection <dbcmd.renameCollection>` command or the
  :pipeline:`$out <pipe.$out>` aggregation stage as part of initial 
  sync, which runs as a part of the |mongomirror| process.

- You must not restart the primary during the initial sync 
  stage of the migration.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-failIndexKeyTooLong-import.rst

.. _source-rs-authorization:

Required Access on Source Replica Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mongomirror| must have network access to the source
replica set. If the source replica set requires authentication,
you must include user credentials when running |mongomirror|.

You must specify a database user with, at a minimum, the following privileges:

- Read all databases and collections. The :authrole:`readAnyDatabase`
  role on the ``admin`` database covers this requirement.

- Read the :term:`oplog`. See :ref:`ref-atlas-oplog`.

- Run the :dbcommand:`getParameter` command.

If no such user exists, create the user in your source MongoDB
replica set. Different MongoDB server versions have different
built-in roles. Select a built-in role based on your MongoDB
server version and run the appropriate commands in the
{+mongosh+}:

.. include:: /includes/mongomirror-required-roles.rst

Target |service| Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The target |service| deployment:

- Can't be an ``M0`` {+free-cluster+}, ``M2``, or ``M5`` {+shared-cluster+}.

- Can't be a {+serverless-instance+}.

- Must be a replica set.

- Must have the version that is the same as or later than the source cluster
  MongoDB version. See :ref:`mongomirror-import-upgrade-path`.
  
- Must not contain any namespaces that overlap with the source cluster.
  If |mongomirror| detects overlapping namespaces on the target cluster
  it fails before starting the process. If your target cluster contains
  overlapping namespaces, delete all data from the target cluster with
  :option:`--drop`, or list the namespaces to import from the source
  cluster with :option:`--includeNamespace`.

- Must include in its IP access list either:

  - The public IP address of the server on which |mongomirror| is running, or

  - If set up for VPC peering, either the peer's VPC CIDR block (or a subset)
    or the Security Group of the peer VPC.

.. _destination-authorization:

Required Access on Target Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mongomirror| must have network access to the target cluster.

You must specify a database user with the :atlasrole:`Atlas admin`
role to run |mongomirror|. To learn more, see :ref:`add-mongodb-users`.

``mongomirror`` Process
-----------------------

When you start |mongomirror|, it:

#. Connects to |service| over |tls-ssl|.

#. Performs an initial sync, copying collections from the existing MongoDB
   replica set to the target cluster in |service|.

#. After the initial sync, continuously tails the replica set's oplog
   for incoming changes and replays them on the target cluster in |service|.
   |mongomirror| does not copy the ``config`` database. As of version
   0.9.0, |mongomirror| uses wire compression if you enable it on either
   the source or the target cluster and use :option:`--compressors`
   to specify which compression libraries to allow.

   .. note::

      Starting in version 0.5.0, |mongomirror| builds all indexes on the
      target cluster in the foreground, regardless of how the indexes were
      built on the source cluster. Foreground index builds block all other
      operations on the database. To learn more, see :manual:`Index Build Operations on a Populated Collection
      </core/index-creation>`.

Once started, |mongomirror| runs continuously until you shut it down:

- If you shut down |mongomirror| during the initial sync stage,
  before you restart |mongomirror|, check that the target cluster
  is empty, or run |mongomirror| with :option:`--drop`.

- If you shut down |mongomirror| during the :term:`oplog` tailing
  stage, the process stops tailing the :term:`oplog`. You can
  restart |mongomirror| to continue tailing from the last processed
  oplog record using :option:`--bookmarkFile`.

.. _mongomirror-migration-procedure:

Run ``mongomirror``
-------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/migrate-using-mongomirror-run.rst

To complete the migration process, :ref:`switch to Atlas <mongomirror-migrate-to-atlas>`.

.. _mongomirror-migrate-to-atlas:

Switch to |service|
-------------------

After |mongomirror| completes the initial sync and tails
the replica set's oplog, you can switch over to the target
|service| cluster.

.. include:: /includes/steps/migrate-using-mongomirror-switch.rst

Monitoring
----------

|mongomirror| logs its progress to the standard output in the terminal.
During the initial sync, |mongomirror| logs a progress bar for each
collection it copies. For example:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   2021-08-09T16:35:50.227-0000  [#....................]  park.events  2179/34184    (6.4%)
   2021-08-09T16:35:50.227-0000  [#############........]  zoo.animals  29000/49778  (58.3%)

When tailing the oplog, |mongomirror| logs the lag time, in seconds,
between the most recent oplog entry on the source cluster and the last
processed oplog entry on the target cluster. For example:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   2016-12-12T16:22:17.027-0800 Current lag from source: 6s

A lag time of 6 seconds means that the last oplog entry
|mongomirror| processed occurred 6 seconds before the most
recent one available on the source cluster.

.. note::

   The amount of time it takes |mongomirror| to catch up may be
   greater or less than 6 seconds, depending on the number of entries
   that arrive per second.

A lag time of 0 seconds indicates that |mongomirror| is processing
entries that arrived less than one second before the latest oplog entry.

If the source cluster has indexes, |mongomirror| builds the same indexes
on the target cluster. The progress log shows the start and end times of
the index building process. To view the progress of the index builds,
you can either:

- Use the :manual:`currentOp </reference/method/db.currentOp/#db.currentOp>`
  command on the primary node of the target cluster. The ``command`` field
  shows information about the running operation. Index building entries
  look similar to the following:

  .. code-block:: json
     :copyable: false

	 "command" : {
		"createIndexes" : "perfs",
		"indexes" : [
			{
				"key" : {
					"animal" : "text"
				},
				"name" : "animal_text"
			}
		]...

- Download the :ref:`mongodb logs <mongodb-logs>` for your target cluster
  and search for recent entries for index-related lines. Log messages related
  to index building look similar to the following:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     {"t":{"$date":"2021-08-09T16:35:50.227+00:00"},"s":"I",  "c":"INDEX",    "id":20447,   "ctx":"conn1080","msg":"Index build: completed","attr":{"buildUUID":{"uuid":{"$uuid":"c4a62739-bf19-456d-bbd6-7baa29f1063b"}}}}

Performance
-----------

To avoid contention for network and CPU resources, run |mongomirror| on
hosts other than your replica set's |mongod| instance hosts.

- |mongomirror| affects your source replica set's performance similar to having
  a secondary:

  - For the initial sync stage, the load scales with the size of your
    data set.

  - Once an initial sync completes, the load scales with oplog gigabytes
    used per hour.

Command Syntax, Options, and Examples

:doc:`mongomirror reference page </reference/mongomirror/>`.
