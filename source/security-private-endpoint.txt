MongoDB |service| supports private endpoints on: 

- |aws| using the `{+aws-pl+} <https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/>`__
  feature, and

- |azure| using the `{+az-pl+}
  <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/private-link/>`__ feature.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+aws-pl+}
      :tabid: {+aws-pl+}

      When you enable this feature, |service| creates its own |vpc| and
      places clusters within a region behind a network load balancer in
      the |service| |vpc|.

      Then you create resources that establish a one-way connection
      from your |vpc| to the network load balancer in the |service|
      |vpc| using a private endpoint.

            :tabid: aws-pl-directconnect-diagram

            .. figure:: /images/atlas-aws-privatelink-directconnect.svg
               :width: 720px
               :alt: Image showing how can use |aws| Direct Connect to establish a transitive connection from your data center to a peered |aws| VPC to resources in the |service| VPC using |aws| Direct Connect.

      Connections to |service| clusters using private endpoints offer
      the following advantages over other network access management
      options:

      - Connections using private endpoints are one-way. |service|
        |vpc|\s can't initiate connections back to your |vpc|\s. This
        ensures your perceived network trust boundary is not extended.

      - Connections to private endpoints within your |vpc| can be made
        transitively from:

        - Another |vpc| peered to the private endpoint-connected |vpc|.
        - An on-premises data center connected with `DirectConnect 
          <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/aws-direct-connect.html>`__
          to the private endpoint-connected |vpc|. This enables you to
          connect to |service| directly from your on-premises data 
          center without adding public IP addresses to the |service| 
          :doc:`IP access list </security/ip-access-list>`.

   .. tab:: {+az-pl+}
      :tabid: {+az-pl+}

      When you enable this feature, |service| creates a Private Link
      service and places clusters within a region behind a load
      balancer in the |service| VNet.

      Then you create resources that establish a one-way connection
      from your VNet to the :azure:`Private Link service
      </private-link/private-link-service-overview>` in the |service|
      VNet using a private endpoint. The Private Link service routes
      traffic to the load balancer that fronts the clusters in the
      |service| VNet.

      Connections to |service| clusters using private endpoints offer
      the following advantages over other network access management
      options:

      - Connections using private endpoints are one-way. |service|
        VNets can't initiate connections back to your VNets. This
        ensures your perceived network trust boundary is not extended.

      - Connections to private endpoints within your VNet can be made
        transitively from:

        - Another VNet peered to the private endpoint-connected VNet.
        - An on-premises data center connected with
          `ExpressRoute <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/expressroute/>`__
          to the private endpoint-connected VNet. This enables you to
          connect to |service| directly from your on-premises data
          center without adding public IP addresses to the |service|
          :doc:`IP access list </security/ip-access-list>`.

Considerations
--------------

High Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+aws-pl+}
      :tabid: {+aws-pl+}

      To ensure private endpoint connections to |service| can withstand
      an availability zone outage, you should deploy subnets to
      multiple availability zones in a region.

   .. tab:: {+az-pl+}
      :tabid: {+az-pl+}

      |azure| private endpoints are regional components. You don't need
      to take additional actions to ensure that private endpoint
      connections to |service| can withstand an availability zone
      outage.

.. _private-endpoint-connection-strings:

Private Endpoint-Aware Connection Strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+aws-pl+}
      :tabid: {+aws-pl+}

      .. include:: /includes/aws-pl-connection-strings.rst

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Connect to Atlas using a Private Endpoint <connect-private-endpoint>`

IP Access Lists and Network Peering Connections with Private Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Private Endpoints are enabled, you can still enable access to your
|service| clusters using other methods, such as adding public IPs to
:doc:`IP access lists </security/ip-access-list>` and
:doc:`network peering </security-vpc-peering>`.

Clients connecting to |service| clusters using other methods use
standard connection strings. Your clients might have to identify when
to use private endpoint-aware connection strings and standard
connection strings.

.. _atlas_regionalized-pl:

Regionalized Private Endpoints for Multi-Region Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For multi-region and global sharded clusters, you can deploy multiple
private endpoints to a region if you need to connect to |service| using
a private endpoint from networks that can't be peered with one another.

You can deploy any number of private endpoints to regions that you
deployed your cluster to. Each regional private endpoint connects to the
|mongos| instances in that region.

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/warnings/regionalized-pls-change-connection-strings.rst

.. include:: /includes/enable-regionalized-privatelink.rst

To use this feature, you must enable the regionalized private endpoint
setting:

.. _atlas-pl-limitations:

Limitations
-----------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+aws-pl+}
      :tabid: {+aws-pl+}

      - You can use {+aws-pl+} to connect to |service| clusters running
        MongoDB version 3.6 or later.

      - {+aws-pl+} must be active in all regions into which you deploy
        a multi-region cluster. You will receive an error if {+aws-pl+}
        is active in some, but not all, targeted regions.

      - You can do only one of the following:

        - Create more than one private endpoint in a single region, or
        - Create one private endpoint in multiple regions.

          .. important::

             This limitation applies across cloud providers. For
             example, if you create more than one private endpoint in a
             single region in |aws|, you can't create private endpoints
             in more than one region in |azure|.

        See :ref:`atlas_regionalized-pl` for an exception for
        multi-region and global sharded clusters.

      - If this is the first private endpoint that you deploy to a   
        region, you must first resume any paused clusters in your
        project with nodes deployed to that region.

        This limitation doesn't apply for additional private endpoints
        that you deploy to the same region.

      - To connect to |service| clusters using {+aws-pl+} from regions
        in which you haven't deployed a private endpoint connection,
        you must peer |vpc|\s in those regions to |vpc|\s in a region
        in which you have deployed a private endpoint connection.

        To learn about inter-region |vpc| peering, see the `AWS
        documentation
        <https://aws.amazon.com/answers/networking/aws-multiple-region-multi-vpc-connectivity/>`__.

      - You can use {+aws-pl+} in |service| projects with up to 50
        addressable targets **per region**. If you need more than 50
        addressable targets in a region:

        - Contact :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>`, or 
        - Use additional projects or regions to connect to addressable
          targets beyond this limit.

        Addressable targets include:

        - Each node in a replica set, excluding nodes that comprise a
          shard in a sharded cluster.
        - Each |mongos| instance for sharded clusters.
        - Each |bic| instance across all dedicated clusters in the
          project.

        .. note::

           To request a one-time increase to use {+aws-pl+} with up to
           100 addressable targets per |service| project, contact
           :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>`.

   .. tab:: {+az-pl+}
      :tabid: {+az-pl+}

      - You can use {+az-pl+} to connect to |service| clusters that run
        MongoDB version 3.6 or later.

        .. include:: /includes/fact-privatelink-azure-az-limitations.rst

      - {+az-pl+} must be active in all regions into which you deploy a
        multi-region cluster. You will receive an error if {+az-pl+} is
        active in some, but not all, targeted regions.

      - You can do only one of the following:

        - Create more than one private endpoints in a single region, or
        - Create one private endpoint in multiple regions.

             endpoints in more than one region in |aws|.

        See :ref:`atlas_regionalized-pl` for an exception for
        multi-region and global sharded clusters.

      - If this is the first private endpoint that you deploy to a   
        region, you must first resume any paused clusters in your
        project with nodes deployed to that region.

        This limitation doesn't apply for additional private endpoints
        that you deploy to the same region.

      - To connect to |service| clusters using {+az-pl+} from regions
        in which you haven't deployed a private endpoint connection,
        you must peer VNets in those regions to VNets in a region in
        which you have deployed a private endpoint connection.

        To learn about Global VNet peering, see the
        :azure:`Azure documentation </virtual-network/virtual-networks-faq#can-i-create-a-peering-connection-to-a-vnet-in-a-different-region>`.

      - You can use {+az-pl+} in |service| projects with up to 150
        addressable targets **per region**. If you need more than 150
        addressable targets in a region:

        - Contact :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>`, or 
        - Use additional projects or regions to connect to addressable
          targets beyond this limit.

        Addressable targets include:

        - Each node in a replica set, excluding nodes that comprise a
          shard in a sharded cluster.
        - Each |mongos| instance for sharded clusters.
        - Each |bic| instance across all dedicated clusters in the
          project.

Prerequisites
-------------

To enable connections to |service| using private endpoints, you must:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+aws-pl+}
      :tabid: {+aws-pl+}

      1. Have either the :authrole:`Project Owner` or
         :authrole:`Organization Owner` role in |service|.

      #. Have an |aws| user account with an |iam| user policy that
         grants permissions to create, modify, describe, and delete
         endpoints. For more information on controlling the use of
         interface endpoints, see the
         :aws:`AWS Documentation </vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html>`.

      #. **(Recommended)**:
         :aws:`Install the AWS CLI </cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html>`.

      #. If you have not already done so, create your |vpc| and EC2
         instances in |aws|. See the :aws:`AWS documentation
         </index.html>` for guidance.

   .. tab:: {+az-pl+}
      :tabid: {+az-pl+}

      1. Have either the :authrole:`Project Owner` or
         :authrole:`Organization Owner` role in |service|.

      #. :azure:`Install the Azure CLI </install-azure-cli>`.

      #. If you have not already done so, create your VNet and Compute
         instances in |azure|. See the :azure:`Azure documentation </>`
         for guidance.

.. I can't find a page in the azure documentation where specific policy
   requirements are described for private endpoints. Do we need to
   include that information here?
