"The documentation project has two \"index files\": ``/contents.txt`` and "
"``/index.txt``. The \"contents\" file provides the documentation's tree "
"structure, which Sphinx uses to create the left-pane navigational structure,"
" to power the \"Next\" and \"Previous\" page functionality, and to provide "
"all overarching outlines of the resource. The \"index\" file is not included"
" in the \"contents\" file (and thus builds will produce a warning here) and "
"is the page that users first land on when visiting the resource."

"The placement of files in the repository depends on the *type* of "

"be more flexible and can more adequately address changes in the product and "
"in users' needs."

"The organization of the site, like all Sphinx sites derives from the "
":rst:dir:`toctree <sphinx:toctree>` structure. However, in order to annotate"
" the table of contents and provide additional flexibility, the MongoDB "
"documentation generates :rst:dir:`toctree` structures using data from YAML "
"files stored in the ``source/includes/`` directory. These files start with "
"``ref-toc`` or ``toc`` and generate output in the ``source/includes/toc/`` "
"directory. Briefly this system has the following behavior:"
