-----------------------------------------------------------

If you created your |service| account using a Gmail or Google Apps
account, the following can cause you to lose access to your
organizations and projects:

- The Google email address with which you signed up differs from the
  email address associated to your account. This is most often the case
  with Gmail or Google Apps aliases.
- Your username or email domain has changed in Google Apps.

To re-gain access to your organizations and projects:

- Ask |a-service| user with the :authrole:`Organization Owner` to
  invite you to the organization to which you lost access, or
- Contact |mdb-support|.

- The project has no active clusters.

To delete a project for an organization, you can delete from the
organization's :guilabel:`Projects` view or the project's
:guilabel:`Project Setting` view. For details, see
