============================
Manage |mms| Users and Roles
============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

|mms| requires users to log in to verify who they are and to determine
their access to features. |mms| provides built-in user management for
controlling authentication and access.

.. only:: onprem

   You can alternatively use LDAP to control authentication and access. If
   you do, you must start with a **fresh installation** of |mms|. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-for-ldap-authentication`.
