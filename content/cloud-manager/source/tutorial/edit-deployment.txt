You can modify a deployment's configuration and topology, including its
MongoDB versions, storage engines, and numbers of hosts or shards. You
can make modifications at all levels of a deployment's topology from a
top-level :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>` or
:manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` to lower levels, such as a replica set within a
sharded cluster, or an individual process within a replica set. You can
also modify :term:`standalone <standalone>` processes.
