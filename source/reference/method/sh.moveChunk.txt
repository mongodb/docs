.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. method:: sh.moveChunk(collection, query, destination)

   :param string collection: 

      Specifies the sharded collection containing the chunk to
      migrate.

   :param document query: 

      A document that specifies an equality match on the shard key,
      which selects the chunk to move.

   :param string destination: 

      Specifies the name of the shard that you wish to move the
      designated chunk to.

   Moves the chunk containing the document specified by the ``query``
   to the shard described by ``destination``.

   This method provides a wrapper around the
   :dbcommand:`moveChunk`. In most circumstances, allow the
   :term:`balancer` to automatically migrate :term:`chunks <chunk>`,
   and avoid calling :method:`sh.moveChunk()` directly.

      :method:`sh.splitFind()`, :doc:`/sharding`, and :ref:`chunk
      migration <sharding-chunk-migration>`.
