100.4.1 Changelog
-----------------

*Released 2021-07-23*

This patch fixes a bug (:issue:` TOOLS-2931`) that was introduced in
version ``100.4.0`` which causes :binary:`~bin.mongodump` to skip any
document that contains an empty field name (e.g. ``{ "": "foo" }``).
Documents with empty field names were not skipped by default if the
``--query`` or ``--queryFile`` options were specified. No tools other
than :binary:`~bin.mongodump` were affected. It is highly recommended to
upgrade to ``100.4.1`` if it is possible that your database contains
documents with empty field names.
