- Unless an abbreviation is common, spell out the words of the
  abbreviation on the first use in an article or topic.

  .. note::

     In FAQ documents, treat every occurrence of a term as the first
     use (that is, spell out the term and show the abbreviation in
     parentheses on every occurrence).

- Show the abbreviation in parentheses after the spelled-out term on
  the first appearance on the page.

  .. example::

     access control list (ACL)

- Use the abbreviation on subsequent uses on the page.

- If you introduce an abbreviation, use it; don't alternate between
  the abbreviation and the spelled-out term.

- Use the ``:abbr:`` role to embed the words as a hover option for the
  first mention of an abbreviation in a paragraph.

  .. code-block:: rst

     :abbr:`ACL (access control list)`

  You may use ``:abbr:`` role on every subsequent reference, if
  desired. You can't use this role within any other text formatting
  notation in {+rst+}. The abbreviation could also be defined within
  the toolchain as a source_constant or a
  :rst:`substitution </directives.html#replacement-text>`.

  Toolchain substitutions would be in the ``conf.py`` for Sphinx /
  Giza-based repos and ``snooty.toml`` for Snooty-based repos.

- Don't capitalize the spelled-out term unless it's a proper name or
  normally capitalized.

  .. example::

     You spell out *AJAX* as *Asynchronous JavaScript and XML*, but
     spell out *ACL* as *access control list*.

- Use the following guidelines related to abbreviations.

     - Don't use

   * - Don't show both the spelled-out term and its abbreviation in a
       title or heading. In most cases, use the abbreviation in the
       title or heading and show the spelled-out term and its
       abbreviation on first use in the text.

     - **Adding an ACL**

       An access control list (ACL) allows access from an outside
       network into the ObjectRocket system.

   * - Use only established abbreviations. Don't create new ones.
     - hybrid cloud
     - HC

   * - Don't use abbreviated forms of MongoDB product names.

       However, if you think that a user might use an abbreviated name
       in a search, you can tag the document with the abbreviation.

   * - If an abbreviation is used as part of a compound modifier,
       hyphenate it as you would a word.

       For more information, see :ref:`hyphens-in-compound-modifiers`.

   * - Don't surround abbreviations with quotation marks.
     - OS
     - "OS"

   * - Use periods only if the abbreviation normally has them (for
       example, *etc.*, although this should not be used in MongoDB
       content) or could otherwise be misread as a word, such as *in.*
       (for *inch*).

     - FTP the file to the server.

   * - Avoid using abbreviations in the possessive. Instead, treat the
       abbreviation as an adjective or put it in a prepositional
       phrase.

     - Type the DBA's password.

   * - To form the plural of an abbreviation, except for a unit of
       measure, append a lowercase *s* without an apostrophe.

       For most abbreviations of units of measure, the singular and
       plural forms are the same (for example, 1 pt and 10 pt).

       If an acronym already represents a plural noun, don't add an
       *s*.

Abbreviations of Byte and Bit
-----------------------------

*Byte* is abbreviated with an uppercase *B*. *Bit* is abbreviated with
a lowercase *b*. For example, *gigabyte* is abbreviated as *GB*, and
*gigabit* is abbreviated as *Gb*.

- Abbreviate capacity when a number preceeds the unit.
- Spell out the term when used on its own.

If you want to emphasize *bit* or *byte*, use the spelled-out term
rather than or in addition to the abbreviation.

Common Abbreviations
--------------------

A common abbreviation is either an industry-standard abbreviation or
one that is well known to your target audience. Following are some
common abbreviations in the computer industry. You don't need to spell
out these terms on first use, unless you think the abbreviation is
unfamiliar to your audience. If you use ``:abbr:`` roles, you can use
them on common terms as a subtle aid in user understanding.
