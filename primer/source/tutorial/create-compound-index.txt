Create Compound Index
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MongoDB supports indexes that contain multiple fields. These are
:ref:`compound indexes <index-type-compound>`, and you can use these
indexes to support more complex queries or to increase the selectivity
of an index.

To create a compound index, pass to the
:method:`~db.collection.ensureIndex()` method an index specification
document that contains the fields to index and the associated sort
order for each field. To store the field in ascending order in the
index, specify ``1`` for the type. To store the field in descending
order, specify ``-1`` for the type. Each field in the index can have
its own order.

The order in which the field appears in the index specification as well
as the sort order of the field matter for compound indexes. For
compound indexes, the index entries are the combinations of the indexed
fields, sorted first by the field that appears first in the index
specification, and then by the subsequent fields in their respective
sort order.
