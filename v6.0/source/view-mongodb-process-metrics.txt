To view the metrics for a specific MongoDB process in a
|mms| deployment, click on that process from the
:guilabel:`Deployment` view. The |mms| process view displays
three tabs for monitoring metrics for the process:

- The :guilabel:`Status` tab displays the process metrics |mms|
  collects from the selected :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` or
  :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>` process.

- The :guilabel:`Hardware` tab displays hardware metrics for
  the host machine supporting the selected
  :manual:`mongod </reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod>` or :manual:`mongos </reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos>`
  process.

- The :guilabel:`DB Stats` tab displays the database metrics for the
  selected database.

.. include:: /includes/fact-cluster-metrics.rst

|mms| retrieves database metrics every 20 minutes by default but
adjusts frequency when necessary to reduce the impact on database
performance. If the collection of database statistics still affects
performance, you can disable collection by clicking
:guilabel:`Settings` from the left-hand navigation,
then :guilabel:`Project Settings`, and then setting
:guilabel:`Collect Database Specific Statistics` to :guilabel:`No`.

The view for each tab has three distinct sections:

Chart Controls
--------------

|mms| provides the following controls for the :guilabel:`Status`,
:guilabel:`Hardware`, and :guilabel:`DB Stats`
views. Adjusting any of these options affects all charts displayed under
