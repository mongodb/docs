Manual Compaction Options

Realm reduces the file size by writing a new (compact) version of the file, and 
then replacing the original with the newly-written file. Therefore, to compact, 
you must have free storage space equivalent to the original realm file size. 

You can configure realm to automatically compact the database each time a
realm is opened, or you can compact the file without first obtaining a
realm instance.

Realm Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can configure Realm to check the realm file each time 
it is opened by specifying a 
:dotnet-sdk:`ShouldCompactDelegate <reference/Realms.RealmConfiguration.ShouldCompactDelegate.html>` 
in the configuration. The following code example shows how to do this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Compact.snippet.config-compact.cs
   :language: csharp

If the delegate returns ``true`` -- and the file is not in use -- the realm file 
is compacted prior to making the instance available.


Realm.Compact() Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alternatively, you can compact a realm file without first obtaining an instance 
to the realm by calling the 
:dotnet-sdk:`Compact() <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_Compact_Realms_RealmConfigurationBase_>`
method. The following example shows how to do this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Compact.snippet.manual-compact.cs
   :language: csharp

The ``Compact`` method will return true if the operation is successful.

Tips for Manually Compacting a Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These calculations might look like this in your delegate:

.. code-block:: csharp

   // Set a maxFileSize equal to 20MB in bytes
   var maxFileSize = 20 * 1024 * 1024;

   /* Check for the realm file size to be greater than the max file size, 
    * or the amount of bytes currently used to be less than 50% of the
    * total realm file size */
   return (totalBytes > (double)maxFileSize) &&
      ((double)usedBytes / totalBytes < 0.5);

Experiment with conditions to find the right balance of how often to 
compact realm files in your application.
