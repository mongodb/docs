To live migrate your source MongoDB deployment monitored in |mms| to
|service-short|, provision a server for the migration host.

Overview
--------

The migration host is a server on which you install a dedicated {+mdbagent+}.
This {+mdbagent+} automates live migration operations. It requires that
you set its configuration option ``agentFeatureCloudMigrationEnabled`` to ``true``.

You use the migration host to manage the live migration process of your
deployment from |mms| to |service-short|. You can't use the migration host
for any other purposes.

After you provision the migration host, its server appears under the
:guilabel:`Servers` tab. A {+mdbagent+} on the migration host runs a
one-time migration of data from |mms| to |service-short| and reports the
live migration status back to |mms|.

To learn about starting a live migration from |mms|, see
:ref:`Migrate a Deployment to Atlas <migrate-to-atlas>` and review the
:ref:`workflow for live migration to Atlas <lm-workflow>`.

Considerations
--------------

If you plan to migrate more than one deployment at a time, create a
dedicated migration host for each of the deployments that you want
to migrate to |service-short|.

.. note::

   Using an HTTP proxy, which intercepts and replaces TLS certificates
   for the relayed HTTPS requests is not supported by |onprem| when you
   use it in hybrid mode.

.. _live-migration-host-supported-platforms:

Prerequisites
-------------

The migration host must use a 64-bit CPU architecture and one of the
following supported platforms. The platforms depend on the migration tool
that the migration host will be running to facilitate the migration.

- Migration host for live migrations (push) of source deployments of MongoDB
  earlier than {+c2c-version+} that you add to monitoring in |cloud-short|,
  where the migration host runs ``mongomirror``:

  .. include:: /includes/list-tables/only-v5-agent-platform-support-table.rst

  .. note::
    
     The configuration of a migration host for live migration is not
     supported on Windows or macOS. You can still live migrate (push) your data
     from a Windows-based deployment to |service-short| if you
     provision your migration host on one of the platforms it supports. 
     You can't live migrate your data from a macOS-based deployment to 
     |service-short|.

  If |mms| is running in local mode, you must have outgoing 
  access to the following server to download :atlas:`mongomirror 
  </reference/mongomirror/>`.

- Migration host for live migrations (push) of MongoDB {+c2c-version+}+ or
  {+c2c-version-7+}+ source
  deployments monitored in |cloud-short|, where the migration host runs `mongosync <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/reference/mongosync/>`__:
  
  The migration host must use a 64-bit CPU architecture and one of the
  `mongosync platforms <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/installation>`__.

Migration Host Resource Requirements
-------------------------------------

The live migration process is CPU-intensive and requires sufficient
network bandwidth. Use a cloud instance with enough resources to help
ensure a successful migration.

Avoid host environments that have been characterized as having
low network bandwidth.

You may also need to provision additional storage for the
:setting:`cloudMigrationOplogPath` option described in the following
procedure.

- MongoDB {+c2c-version+}+ or {+c2c-version-7+}+. For the migration host that runs ``mongosync`` to
  facilitate push live migrations, use an instance
  with a minimum of 8 CPUs and 24 GB of RAM.

- MongoDB versions earlier than {+c2c-version+}. For the migration host that runs
  ``mongomirror`` to facilitate push live migrations, use a host
  with 2-4 CPU cores and 4-8 GB of RAM to migrate a replica set.
  Use an instance with 2-4 CPU cores per shard to migrate a sharded cluster.

Next Steps
----------

Once you have provisioned the migration host, you can switch to
|service-short| and follow the steps in the wizard to
start the live migration process.
