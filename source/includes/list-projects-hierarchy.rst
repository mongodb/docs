By having multiple projects within an organization, you can:

- Isolate different environments (for instance, development/qa/prod
  environments) from each other.

- Associate different users or teams with different environments, or
  give different permissions to users in different environments.

- Maintain separate cluster security configurations. For example:

  - Create/manage different sets of database user credentials for
    each project.

  - Isolate networks in different VPCs.

- Create different alert settings. For example, configure alerts for
  Production environments differently than Development environments.
