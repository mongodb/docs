The following procedure describes how to connect to a MongoDB resource
deployed by |k8s| from outside of the |k8s| cluster.

Prerequisite
------------

Compatible MongoDB Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For your databases to be accessed outside of |k8s|, they must run one
of the following versions of MongoDB:

- 3.6.17 or later
- 4.0.15 or later
- 4.2.3 or later

Procedure
---------

How you connect to a MongoDB resource that the |k8s-op-short| deployed
from outside of the |k8s| cluster depends on the resource.

.. tabs-deployments::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: standalone

      This procedure uses the following example:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/yaml-files/example-standalone.yaml
        :language: yaml
        :start-after: START-standalone-exposed-full
        :end-before: END-standalone-exposed-full
        :linenos:
        :lineno-start: 1
        :emphasize-lines: 15

      To connect to your |k8s-op-short|-deployed MongoDB standalone
      resource from outside of the |k8s| cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-external-standalone.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: repl

      .. important::

         This procedure explains the least complicated way to enable
         external connectivity. Other utilities can be used in
         production.

      To connect to your |k8s-op-short|-deployed MongoDB replica set
      resource from outside of the |k8s| cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-split-horizon.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: shard

      This procedure uses the following example:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Without TLS
            :tabid: k8s-without-tls

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/yaml-files/example-sharded-cluster.yaml
               :language: yaml
               :start-after: START-exposed-sharded-full
               :end-before: END-exposed-sharded-full
               :linenos:
               :lineno-start: 1
               :emphasize-lines: 19
               :copyable: false

         .. tab:: With TLS
            :tabid: k8s-with-tls

            .. admonition:: Enable Direct Access to MongoDB hosts Using Split Horizons and TLS
               :class: note

               If the |k8s-op-short| deployed a |tls|\-enabled sharded
               cluster, provide the external |dns| names (|san-dns|\s)
               for each member.

               The |san-dns| for each MongoDB hosts corresponds to:

               .. code-block:: sh
                  :copyable: false

                  <mdb-resource-name><shard><pod-index>.<external-domain>
                  <mdb-resource-name><config><pod-index>.<external-domain>
                  <mdb-resource-name><mongos><pod-index>.<external-domain>

               Each |tls| certificate requires the |fqdn| (|san-dns|)
               that corresponds to the |fqdn| that this host has
               outside the |k8s| cluster.

            .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/yaml-files/example-sharded-cluster.yaml
               :language: yaml
               :start-after: START-exposed-sharded-tls-full
               :end-before: END-exposed-sharded-tls-full
               :linenos:
               :lineno-start: 1
               :emphasize-lines: 19-24
               :copyable: false

      To connect to your |k8s-op-short|-deployed MongoDB sharded
      cluster resource from outside of the |k8s| cluster:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/enable-external-sharded.rst
