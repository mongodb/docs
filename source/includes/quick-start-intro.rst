You can configure {+mcli+} access to your MongoDB service using
the :ref:`mcli-config-command` and :ref:`mcli-config-set-command`
commands. In the following steps, the commands:

- Create the {+default-profile+} in the
  :ref:`configuration file <mcli-config-file>`.
- Set your programmatic |api| access keys and project ID in the
  profile.

You can use this profile with all the other commands in this
tutorial.
