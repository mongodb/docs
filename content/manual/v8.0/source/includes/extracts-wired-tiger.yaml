   If the ``dbpath`` is on a single volume, filesystem snapshots are
   sufficient for the purpose of volume-level backup of WiredTiger. If
   you do use journaling, the journal **must** reside on the same volume
   as the data.

   With WiredTiger, the ``dbpath``, including the journal files if

   - WiredTiger sets checkpoints for journal data at intervals of 60
     seconds or 2 GB of data, depending on which occurs first.

   - Because MongoDB uses a log file size limit of 100 MB, WiredTiger
     creates a new journal file approximately every 100 MB of data. When
     WiredTiger creates a new journal file, WiredTiger syncs the previous
     journal file.

   - If the write operation includes a :doc:`write concern
     </reference/write-concern>` of ``j:true``, WiredTiger forces a
     sync on commit of that operation as well as anything that has
     happened before.

   With WiredTiger, MongoDB utilizes both the WiredTiger internal cache
   and the filesystem cache.

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/wt-cache-default-setting.rst

   By default, WiredTiger uses Snappy block compression for all collections
   and prefix compression for all indexes. Compression defaults are configurable
   at a global level and can also be set on a per-collection and per-index
   basis during collection and index creation.

   Different representations are used for data in the WiredTiger internal cache
   versus the on-disk format:

   - Data in the filesystem cache is the same as the on-disk format, including
     benefits of any compression for data files. The filesystem cache is used
     by the operating system to reduce disk I/O.
   - Indexes loaded in the WiredTiger internal cache have a different data
     representation to the on-disk format, but can still take advantage of
     index prefix compression to reduce RAM usage. Index prefix compression
     deduplicates common prefixes from indexed fields.
   - Collection data in the WiredTiger internal cache is uncompressed
     and uses a different representation from the on-disk format. Block
     compression can provide significant on-disk storage savings, but
     data must be uncompressed to be manipulated by the server.

   Cache Configuration Settings
   ````````````````````````````

   The default WiredTiger internal cache size is the larger of either:

   - 50% of (RAM - 1GB), or

   - 0.256 GB.

   For example, on a system with a total of 4GB of RAM the
   WiredTiger cache uses 1.5GB of RAM (``0.5 * (4GB - 1GB) =
   1.5 GB``). When providing a specific cache size ensure the RAM does not 
   exceed the bounds of 0.256GB to 10000GB. 

   Avoid increasing the WiredTiger internal cache size above its default value.
   If your case requires to do so, you can use ``--wiredTigerCacheSizePct`` to
   account for changes in memory due to vertical. You must specify a percentage 
   of up to 80% of available memory. Calculated values can 
   range from 0.256GB to 10000GB. For example, on a system with 2GB of 
   RAM the ``--wiredTigerCacheSizePct`` cannot be set to 10 because 10% of 2GB 
   is 0.2 GB, which is less than 0.256GB.
   
   .. note::

      In some instances, such as when running in a container that is configured
      to use less RAM than the amount of memory provisioned for the host, you
      must account for the limits. You may need to configure the WiredTiger cache
      to an appropriate value, as WiredTiger may not account for the memory 
      limits of the specific container in certain cases. 
   
      To view the :data:`memory limit <hostInfo.system.memLimitMB>`, the value
      that WiredTiger utilizes as the maximum amount of RAM available use the
      :dbcommand:`hostInfo` command. 
   
---
ref: wt-filesystem-cache
content: |

  With the filesystem cache, MongoDB automatically uses all free memory
  that is not used by the WiredTiger cache or by other processes.
---
ref: wt-snapshot-frequency
content: |

      MongoDB configures WiredTiger to create checkpoints, specifically, writing 
      the snapshot data to disk at intervals of 60 seconds. 

---
ref: wt-journal-frequency
content: |

   WiredTiger syncs the buffered journal records to disk upon any of
   the following conditions:

   - For replica set members (primary and secondary members):

     - If a write operation includes or implies a write concern of
       :writeconcern:`j: true <j>`.

     - Additionally for secondary members, after every batch
       application of the oplog entries.

     .. note::

        Write concern :writeconcern:`"majority"` implies ``j: true`` if
        the :rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` is true.

   - At every 100 milliseconds (See :setting:`storage.journal.commitIntervalMs`).

   - When WiredTiger creates a new journal file. Because MongoDB uses a
     journal file size limit of 100 MB, WiredTiger creates a new
     journal file approximately every 100 MB of data.

ref: wt-log-compression-limit
content: |

   If a log record is less than or equal to 128 bytes, which is the minimum
   :ref:`log record size for WiredTiger <wt-jouraling-record>`,
   WiredTiger does not compress that record.
