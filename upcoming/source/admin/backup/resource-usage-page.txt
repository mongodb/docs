This page provides key size and throughput statistics on a per-job
basis for all projects for which you enabled backup.

|onprem| displays a list of the following information in two tables
:guilabel:`Per Job` and :guilabel:`Per Project`:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Column Title
     - Content

   * - Oplog Receiving (last 24 hours)
     - Displays statistics for oplog throughput over the past 24 hours.

   * - Oplog Application (last 24 hours)
     - Displays statistics for oplog processing over the past 24 hours.

   * - SnapshotStore usage
     - Displays the following information:

       - The size of both the live and dead bytes for the job in the
         snapshot store
       - Timestamp for when |onprem| last groomed this backup job
       - Timestamp for when |onprem| last ran tracking job for this
         backup job

       The :ref:`Resource Tracking job <groom-priority-page>` gathers
       these statistics.

.. note:: Multiple backup jobs use the same snapshot store.
