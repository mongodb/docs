  A document that contains the field and value pairs where the field is
  the index key and the value describes the type of index for that
  field. For an ascending index on a field, specify a value of ``1``; for
  descending index, specify a value of ``-1``. Starting in 3.6, you 
  cannot specify ``*`` as the index name.

  MongoDB supports several different index types including
  :ref:`text <index-feature-text>`, :ref:`geospatial
  <index-feature-geospatial>`, and :ref:`hashed
  <index-type-hashed>` indexes. See :ref:`index types <index-types>`
  for more information.

  .. versionchanged:: 4.2

     MongoDB 4.2 :ref:`wildcard indexes <wildcard-index-core>`
     support workloads where users query against custom fields or a
     large variety of fields in a collection:

     - To create a wildcard index on all fields and subfields in a 
       document, specify ``{ "$**" : 1 }`` as the index key. You
       cannot specify a descending index key when creating a wildcard
       index.

       You can also either include *or* exclude specific fields and
       their subfields from the index using the optional
       ``wildcardProjection`` parameter.

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/wildcard-index-id.rst

     - You can create a wildcard index on a specific field
       and its subpaths by specifying the full path to that field as the
       index key and append ``"$**"`` to the path:

       ``{ "path.to.field.$**" : 1 }`` 

       You cannot specify a descending index key when creating a
       wildcard index.

       The path-specific wildcard index syntax is incompatible with the
       ``wildcardProjection`` option. You cannot specify additional
       inclusions or exclusions on the specified path.

     The wildcard index key **must** use one of the syntaxes listed
     above. For example, you cannot specify a
     :doc:`compound index key </core/index-compound>`.  For more 
     complete documentation on wildcard indexes, including restrictions 
     on their creation, see :ref:`wildcard-index-restrictions`.
