"The :method:`cursor.skip()` method is often expensive because it requires"
" the server to walk from the beginning of the collection or index to get "
"the offset or skip position before beginning to return results. As the "
"offset (e.g. ``pageNumber`` above) increases, :method:`cursor.skip()` "
"will become slower and more CPU intensive. With larger collections, "
":method:`cursor.skip()` may become IO bound."

"Consider using range-based pagination for these kinds of tasks. That is, "
"query for a range of objects, using logic within the application to "
"determine the pagination rather than the database itself. This approach "
"features better index utilization, if you do not need to easily jump to a"
" specific page."
