You can use the |compass-short| :abbr:`CLI (Command-Line Interface)` to
export saved connections. Colleagues can import your saved connections, or
you can use them yourself in your other workspaces.

Export Encrypted Saved Connections
-------------------------------------

This section shows how to export encrypted saved connections. When
you encrypt the export file, users must specify the matching passphrase
to import the connections.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To export encrypted saved connections with the |compass-short|
:abbr:`CLI (Command-Line Interface)`, specify:

- The path to the |compass| executable. The name and file path of the
  executable depend on your operating system.

- The ``--export-connections`` option set to the destination of the
  output file.

- The ``--passphrase`` option set to a passphrase used to encrypt the
  output file.

Your operation should resemble the following prototype:

.. code-block:: sh

   <path-to-Compass-executable> \
   --export-connections=<filename> \
   --passphrase=<passphrase>

Example
~~~~~~~

This example exports saved |compass-short| connections to a file with
the path ``/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json``. The exported file
is encrypted with the passphrase ``abc123``.

Run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass
executable:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./MongoDB\ Compass \
   --export-connections=/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json \
   --passphrase=abc123
   
.. note::

   The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating
   system. The preceding command is for macOS.

You will see this output:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   Exporting connections to "/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json" (with passphrase)

Results
```````

After the export completes, the
``/tmp/compass-connections/favorites-encrypted.json`` file resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "type": "Compass Connections",
     "version": {
       "$numberInt": "1"
     },
     "connections": [
       {
         "id": "5a92e195-3ef5-49ae-aff6-720af362770d",
         "connectionOptions": {
           "connectionString": "mongodb+srv://jallen@cluster0.ylwlz.mongodb.net/"
         },
         "favorite": {
           "name": "Dochub",
           "color": "color7"
         },
         "lastUsed": {
           "$date": {
             "$numberLong": "1663785601002"
           }
         },
         "connectionSecrets": "AAGRWyDUI+Jbc9GkvSpEZeFtbvSzqtcOpA+1zLi5fma3AISOOVVBJBPqqh/a6VeNyEcf9TdX6aCqSpagXgMAOmmN0XgkJ4wxwBuSZwZH/h1dlgEFYqEG9Oh88e5z"
       },
       {
         "id": "655f3e6e-b13b-4813-8578-50d896bd9240",
         "connectionOptions": {
           "connectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
         },
         "favorite": {
           "name": "Local Host",
           "color": "color7"
         },
         "lastUsed": {
           "$date": {
             "$numberLong": "1663790327679"
           }
         },
         "connectionSecrets": "AAG63lys6oVtPmCGVs7wYkTCjFU0yXi9rYUYCKuWGNMSNBy4rAZlu06b/qDblON4OBXDJzhPNQ/WKs79veewNw=="
       }
     ]
   }

Sensitive connection information is encrypted in the
``connectionSecrets`` field.

Export Unencrypted Saved Connections
---------------------------------------

This section shows how to export unencrypted saved connections. If
you do not encrypt the export file, database usernames and passwords are
exported in plaintext. Only export unencrypted connections if no other
users will have access to the exported file.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

To export encrypted saved connections with the |compass-short|
:abbr:`CLI (Command-Line Interface)`, specify:

- The path to the |compass| executable. The name and file path of the
  executable depend on your operating system.

- The ``--export-connections`` option set to the destination of the
  output file.

Your operation should resemble the following prototype:

.. code-block:: sh

   <path-to-Compass-executable> \
   --export-connections=<filename>

Example
~~~~~~~

This example exports saved |compass-short| connections to a file with
the path ``/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json``.

Run the following command in the folder containing your MongoDB Compass
executable:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./MongoDB\ Compass \
   --export-connections=/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json
   
.. note::

   The name and file path of the executable depend on your operating
   system. The preceding command is for macOS.

You will see this output:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false

   Exporting connections to "/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json" (without passphrase)

Results
```````

After the export completes, the
``/tmp/compass-connections/favorites.json`` file resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "type": "Compass Connections",
     "version": {
       "$numberInt": "1"
     },
     "connections": [
       {
         "id": "5a92e195-3ef5-49ae-aff6-720af362770d",
         "connectionOptions": {
           "connectionString": "<connection string>"
         },
         "favorite": {
           "name": "QA Cluster",
           "color": "color7"
         },
         "lastUsed": {
           "$date": {
             "$numberLong": "1663785601002"
           }
         }
       },
       {
         "id": "655f3e6e-b13b-4813-8578-50d896bd9240",
         "connectionOptions": {

           "$date": {

         }
       }
     ]
