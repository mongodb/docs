Install On Prem MMS for Development and Testing
===============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

MMS On Prem is a package that monitors and backs up MongoDB
deployments. On Prem MMS uses the components described in
:doc:`/core/system-overview`. In a test deployment, you can run an
entire On Prem MMS deployment on a single system as in the
:ref:`on-prem-minimal-deployment-diagram` diagram.

The minimal deployment is for testing and development purposes
only. Running on a single server is *not** suitable for production
deployments.
