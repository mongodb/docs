.. dbcommand:: delete

   The :dbcommand:`delete` command removes documents from a collection.
   A single :dbcommand:`delete` command can contain multiple delete
   specifications. The command cannot operate on :doc:`capped
   collections </core/capped-collections>`. The remove methods provided
   by the MongoDB drivers use this command internally.

   The :dbcommand:`delete` command has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         delete: <collection>,
         deletes: [
            { 
              q : <query>, 
              limit : <integer>, 
              collation: <document>,
              hint: <document|string>,
              comment: <any>
            },
            ...
         ],
         ordered: <boolean>,
         writeConcern: { <write concern> }
      }

   The command takes the following fields:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field
   
        - Type
   
        - Description
   
      * - :ref:`delete <delete-command-delete>`
   
        - string
   
        - .. _delete-command-delete:
        
          The name of the target collection.
          
          
   
      * - :ref:`deletes <delete-command-deletes>`
   
        - array
   
        - .. _delete-command-deletes:
        
          An array of one or more delete statements to perform in the named
          collection.
          
          
   
      * - :ref:`ordered <delete-command-ordered>`
   
        - boolean
   
        - .. _delete-command-ordered:
        
          Optional. If ``true``, then when a delete statement fails, return without
          performing the remaining delete statements. If ``false``, then when a
          delete statement fails, continue with the remaining delete
          statements, if any. Defaults to ``true``.
          
          
   
      * - :ref:`writeConcern <delete-command-wc>`
   
        - document
   
        - .. _delete-command-wc:
        
          Optional. A document expressing the :doc:`write concern </reference/write-concern>`
          of the :dbcommand:`delete` command. Omit to use the default write
          concern.

   .. |operation| replace:: delete

   .. |operations| replace:: delete statements



   Each element of the ``deletes`` array contains the following fields:


   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 80
   
      * - Field

        - document
   
        - .. _deletes-array-q:
        
          The query that matches documents to delete.
          
          
   
      * - :ref:`limit <deletes-array-limit>`
   
        - integer
   
        - .. _deletes-array-limit:
        
          The number of matching documents to delete. Specify either a ``0`` to
          delete all matching documents or ``1`` to delete a single document.
          
          
   
      * - :ref:`collation <deletes-array-collation>`
   
        - document
   
        - .. _deletes-array-collation:
        
          Optional. 
          
          .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-option.rst

      * - :ref:`hint <deletes-array-hint>`

        - Document or string

        - .. _deletes-array-hint:
        
          Optional. A document or string that specifies the :doc:`index
          </indexes>` to use to support the :ref:`query predicate
          <deletes-array-q>`.
          
          The option can take an index specification document or the
          index name string.
          
          If you specify an index that does not exist, the operation
          errors.

          For an example, see :ref:`ex-delete-command-hint`.

   :returns:

      A document that contains the status of the operation.
      See :ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

Behavior
--------

Sharded Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |single-modification-operation-names| replace:: :dbcommand:`delete`

.. |single-modification-operation-option| replace:: ``limit: 1``

.. include:: /includes/fact-single-modification-in-sharded-collections.rst


Limits
~~~~~~

The total size of all the queries (i.e. the ``q`` field values) in the
``deletes`` array must be less than or equal to the :limit:`maximum
BSON document size <BSON Document Size>`.

The total number of delete documents in the ``deletes`` array must be
less than or equal to the :limit:`maximum bulk size
<Bulk Operation Size>`.

Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-operations-write-concern.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-usage.rst


Examples
--------

Limit the Number of Documents Deleted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example deletes from the ``orders`` collection one
document that has the ``status`` equal to ``D`` by specifying the
``limit`` of ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
         delete: "orders",
         deletes: [ { q: { status: "D" }, limit: 1 } ]
      }
   )

The returned document shows that the command deleted ``1`` document.
See :ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "ok" : 1, "n" : 1 }

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-single-modification-in-sharded-collections.rst

Delete All Documents That Match a Condition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example deletes from the ``orders`` collection all
documents that have the ``status`` equal to ``D`` by specifying the
``limit`` of ``0``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
         delete: "orders",
         deletes: [ { q: { status: "D" }, limit: 0 } ],
         writeConcern: { w: "majority", wtimeout: 5000 }
      }
   )

The returned document shows that the command found and deleted ``13``
documents. See :ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "ok" : 1, "n" : 13 }

Delete All Documents from a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Delete all documents in the ``orders`` collection by specifying an
empty query condition *and* a ``limit`` of ``0``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
         delete: "orders",
         deletes: [ { q: { }, limit: 0 } ],
         writeConcern: { w: "majority", wtimeout: 5000 }
      }
   )

The returned document shows that the command found and deleted ``35``
documents in total. See :ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "ok" : 1, "n" : 35 }

Bulk Delete
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example performs multiple delete operations on the
``orders`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
         delete: "orders",
         deletes: [
            { q: { status: "D" }, limit: 0 },
            { q: { cust_num: 99999, item: "abc123", status: "A" }, limit: 1 }
         ],
         ordered: false,
         writeConcern: { w: 1 }
      }
   )

The returned document shows that the command found and deleted ``21``
documents in total for the two delete statements. See
:ref:`delete-command-output` for details.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "ok" : 1, "n" : 21 }

Specify Collation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-versionadded.rst

A collection ``myColl`` has the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, category: "caf√©", status: "A" }
   { _id: 2, category: "cafe", status: "a" }
   { _id: 3, category: "cafE", status: "a" }

The following operation includes the :ref:`collation <collation>`
option:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand({
      delete: "myColl",
      deletes: [
        { q: { category: "cafe", status: "a" }, limit: 0, collation: { locale: "fr", strength: 1 } }
      ]
   })

.. _ex-delete-command-hint:

Specify ``hint`` for Delete Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 4.4

From the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, create a ``members`` collection
with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.insertMany([
      { "_id" : 1, "member" : "abc123", "status" : "P", "points" :  0,  "misc1" : null, "misc2" : null },
      { "_id" : 2, "member" : "xyz123", "status" : "A", "points" : 60,  "misc1" : "reminder: ping me at 100pts", "misc2" : "Some random comment" },
      { "_id" : 3, "member" : "lmn123", "status" : "P", "points" :  0,  "misc1" : null, "misc2" : null },
      { "_id" : 4, "member" : "pqr123", "status" : "D", "points" : 20,  "misc1" : "Deactivated", "misc2" : null },
      { "_id" : 5, "member" : "ijk123", "status" : "P", "points" :  0,  "misc1" : null, "misc2" : null },
      { "_id" : 6, "member" : "cde123", "status" : "A", "points" : 86,  "misc1" : "reminder: ping me at 100pts", "misc2" : "Some random comment" }
   ])

Create the following indexes on the collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.members.createIndex( { status: 1 } )
   db.members.createIndex( { points: 1 } )

The following delete operation explicitly hints to use the index
``{ status: 1 }``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand({
      delete: "members",
      deletes: [
        { q: { "points": { $lte: 20 }, "status": "P" }, limit: 0, hint: { status: 1 } }
      ]
   })

.. note::
   
   If you specify an index that does not exist, the operation errors.

To see the index used, run :dbcommand:`explain` on the operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
        explain: {
          delete: "members",
          deletes: [ 
            { q: { "points": { $lte: 20 }, "status": "P" }, limit: 0, hint: { status: 1 } }
          ]
        },
        verbosity: "queryPlanner"
      }
   )

.. _delete-command-output:
