Description
-----------

.. method:: db.killOp(opid)

   Terminates an operation as specified by the operation ID. To find
   operations and their corresponding IDs, see :pipeline:`$currentOp`
   or :method:`db.currentOp()`.

   The :method:`db.killOp()` method has the following parameter:

   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/method-db.killOp-param.rst

   .. |command| replace:: :method:`db.killOp()`

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/warning-terminating-ops-method.rst

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

   The ``db.killOp()`` method can be run on a :binary:`~bin.mongos` and can
   kill queries that are running on more than one shard in a cluster.
   For information on how to list sharding operations that are active on
   a mongos, see the ``localOps`` parameter in  :pipeline:`$currentOp`.

Access Control
--------------

On systems running with :setting:`~security.authorization`, to kill
operations not owned by the user, the user must have access that
includes the :authaction:`killop` privilege action.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2.9
   On :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, users can kill their own operations
   even without the :authaction:`killop` privilege action.
