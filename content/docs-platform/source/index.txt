Docs Platform Docs
==================

This is the home for Docs Platform docs. The main focus of these docs are to
showcase how different MongoDB docs components are used across the site in a consolidated
location. It is intended to help test regressions for different examples of docs components 
rather than to document how to use them to write docs. 

For guidance on how to use components to write docs, please refer to the 
`MongoDB Docs Style Guide <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/meta/style-guide/>`__.

For a list of docs components, refer to:

- `Frontend components <https://github.com/mongodb/snooty/tree/main/src/components>`__
- `Parser reStructuredText spec/definitions <https://github.com/mongodb/snooty-parser/blob/main/snooty/rstspec.toml>`__

For more information on reStructuredText, use resources such as:

- `Sphinx docs <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`__
- `Docutils docs <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`__
