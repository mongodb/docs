To restore a :term:`snapshot` using :abbr:`HTTP (HyperText Transport
Protocol)`, the :term:`Backup Daemon` creates and displays a download
link in |mms| to the appropriate snapshot in snapshot storage.

After clicking the download link, |mms| streams the snapshot to the
target snapshot host.

.. note::
   PIT restores include points in time, oplog timestamps, and
   checkpoints.

1. The user selects a timestamp:

   - Through the |mms| application:

     1. Click on a timestamp.
     #. Submit their request.

   - Through the :doc:`API </reference/api/restorejobs/get-one-single-restore-job-for-one-cluster>`:

     1. Find the cluster to restore.
     #. :doc:`Create new Restore Job </reference/api/restorejobs/create-one-restore-job-for-one-cluster>`
        for that cluster.

#. |mms| creates a RestoreJob document.

#. The :term:`Backup Daemon` service picks up the RestoreJob document
   and sets the status of this RestoreJob to :guilabel:`Waiting for
   Customer...`.

#. With the status set to :guilabel:`Waiting for Customer...`, |mms|
   creates a URL.

#. The user clicks the :guilabel:`get link` link, then
   :guilabel:`Download` in the |mms| application to download the
   :term:`snapshot`.

#. |mms| sets the RestoreJob document status to
   :guilabel:`Transferring...` and starts streaming the :term:`snapshot`
   in the requested format from the :term:`Snapshot Store` to the target
   snapshot host. Each Snapshot Store streams its snapshot components
   through |mms|:

   a. A :term:`Blockstore <Backup Blockstore Database>` streams Blocks.
   #. A :term:`S3 Snapshot Store` streams the Blocks.
   #. A :term:`File System Store` streams the Files.

#. The user downloads the MongoDB Backup Restore Utility from the |mms|
   application to the target snapshot host.

   .. note::
      The :abbr:`MBRU (MongoDB Backup Restore Utility)` is not unique to
      each restore. If the utility is installed on the host where the
      snapshot will be restored, the user does not need to download it
      again.

#. The user starts a temporary MongoDB instance on the target snapshot
   host. The fetched :term:`oplog` is applied to the snapshot restored
   to this instance.

#. The user runs the :abbr:`MBRU (MongoDB Backup Restore Utility)` to
   request the :term:`oplog`.

#. The :abbr:`MBRU (MongoDB Backup Restore Utility)` fetches the oplog
   for the point-in-time snapshot.

#. The :abbr:`MBRU (MongoDB Backup Restore Utility)` applies the oplog
   to snapshot in the temporary MongoDB instance.

#. The user exports the restored database from the temporary MongoDB
   instance.
