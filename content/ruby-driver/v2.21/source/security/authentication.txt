Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to authenticate to MongoDB by using the
**authentication mechanisms** available in {+mdb-server+}.
Authentication mechanisms are processes by which the driver and server confirm
the identity of a client to ensure security before connecting.

   To learn how to establish a connection to your MongoDB deployment, see the
   :ref:`ruby-get-started-connect-to-mongodb` guide.

MongoDB Edition Compatibility

The following table lists the authentication mechanisms supported by MongoDB and
the {+mdb-server+} editions that each mechanism is compatible with. Click the name of
a mechanism to learn more about how to use it with your application.

Authentication Troubleshooting
------------------------------

This section describes common authentication errors and how to resolve them.

OperationFailure When Reading local Database With Auth On
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you encounter the following error when trying to read the ``local`` database:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Error::OperationFailure: not authorized on local to execute command { find: "oplog.rs", filter: { ts:
    { $gte: Timestamp 1497449043000|0 } }, sort: { $natural: 1 } } (13)

You can fix this by adjusting your user's roles to ensure that your user has
privileges to the local database. If you specifically want to access the oplog,
you can also create a custom role with read access to the local database's
``oplog.rs`` collection. For more information about roles, see
:manual:`Role Management Methods </reference/method/js-role-management/>` in the Server
manual.

Mongo::Auth::Unauthorized User is Not Authorized to Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some users report encountering the following error:

.. code-block:: ruby

  Mongo::Auth::Unauthorized: User ... is not authorized to access ...

After upgrading to {+driver-short+} version 2.5 and later, the driver was
changed to use the SCRAM authorization mechanism by default. This error might
happen if the authorization mechanism your user was created with does not match
the authorization mechanism used by the driver. You can specify the preferred
authorization mechanism using the ``auth_mech`` option in your ``mongoid.yml``
file.
