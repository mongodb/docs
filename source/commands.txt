This document lists the VS Code commands available for
|vsce|. To open the Command Palette and execute these commands:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/command-palette-options.rst

.. include:: /includes/admonitions/tip-mongodb-command-palette.rst

Connection Commands
-------------------

Run these commands from the Command Palette to create new connections or
manage existing connections to your MongoDB deployments.

Configuring a new connection adds a new entry to your
:guilabel:`Connections` list in the |vsce| view. Select a connection
from the list to activate that connection.

To learn more about connecting to a deployment, see :ref:`vsce-connect`.

.. note::

   You can configure multiple connections, but only have one *active*
   connection open at a time.

   * - Command
     - Description

   * - :ref:`Connect <vsce-cmd-connect>`

       .. _vsce-cmd-connect:

     - Connect to your MongoDB deployment by filling in your connection
       information in the connection dialog.

   * - :ref:`Connect with Connection String <vsce-cmd-connect-string>`

       .. _vsce-cmd-connect-string:

     - Connect to your MongoDB deployment by pasting your 
       :manual:`connection string URI </reference/connection-string/>`
       directly into the command palette. Connecting to a deployment
       adds a new entry to your :guilabel:`Connections` list in the
       |vsce| view.

       |service| provides a connection string for your clusters which
       you can pass into this command.

   * - :ref:`Disconnect <vsce-cmd-disconnect>`

       .. _vsce-cmd-disconnect:

     - Disconnect from your active deployment connection.

   * - :ref:`Remove Connection <vsce-cmd-remove-connection>`

       .. _vsce-cmd-remove-connection:

     - Select and remove a connection from your list of connections
       in |vsce|.

       Removing your current active connection also closes that
       connection.

Shell Commands
--------------

Run this command from the Command Palette to open a MongoDB Shell
connected to your deployment.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40

   * - Command
     - Description

   * - :ref:`Launch MongoDB Shell <vsce-cmd-launch-shell>`

       .. _vsce-cmd-launch-shell:

     - :gold:`IMPORTANT:` This command is not supported on Windows.
     
       Open the VS Code :guilabel:`Terminal` and automatically connect a
       MongoDB shell to the deployment specified in your active
       connection.
       
       Specify the MongoDB shell to use in the ``mdb.shell``
       :ref:`setting <vsce-settings>`. |vsce| supports the following
       shells:

       - Legacy :binary:`mongo <mongo>` shell
       - ``mongosh`` shell.

Playground Commands
-------------------

Run these commands from the Command Palette to create and run
:ref:`playgrounds <vsce-playgrounds>`.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40

   * - Command
     - Description

   * - :ref:`Create MongoDB Playground <vsce-cmd-playground-create>`

       .. _vsce-cmd-playground-create:

     - Create a new playground to run against your MongoDB deployment.

       By default, playgrounds load with a template containing
       sample commands. You can disable this template from your
       :ref:`extension settings <vsce-settings>`.

   * - :ref:`Run All From Playground <vsce-cmd-playground-run>`

       .. _vsce-cmd-playground-run:

     - Run file you are currently viewing in VS Code as a playground.
       Your playground runs against the deployment specified in your
       active connection.
       
       |vsce| splits your playground window to display the results in 
       a pane titled :guilabel:`Playground Results.json` to the right 
       of your playground. If you disabled split-view for your VS Code 
       Editor window, |vsce| displays the playground results in a new 
       tab to the right of your playground. If you manually move your 
       playground results, |vsce| displays the results in that tab.

|vsce| View Commands
--------------------

Run these commands from the Command Palette to manage the |vsce| view in
the left navigation panel.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40

   * - Command
     - Description

   * - :ref:`Focus on MongoDB View <vsce-cmd-focus>`

       .. _vsce-cmd-focus:

     - Open and focus on the |vsce| view.

   * - :ref:`Show MongoDB <vsce-cmd-show>`

       .. _vsce-cmd-show:

     - If |vsce| is hidden from your extension view, show it.
