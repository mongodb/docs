You can use the :guilabel:`Data Explorer` to manage documents inside
your cluster collections. Documents are individual records in a MongoDB
collection and are the basic unit of data in MongoDB.

Viewing documents and collections in the :guilabel:`Data Explorer` can
provide a high-level overview of your database schema. You can use the
:guilabel:`Data Explorer` to ensure you are following MongoDB's core
data modeling concepts, such as utilizing embedded documents and arrays.
