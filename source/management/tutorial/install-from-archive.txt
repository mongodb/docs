.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| is a service to monitor and back up a MongoDB infrastructure. This
tutorial describes the basic process to install and configure the service.

At a high level, a basic installation will look like the following.
The estimated setup time is less than an hour.

#. Install a standalone local MongoDB server backed by a fast, large storage volume.

#. Install an SMTP email server as appropriate for your environment.

#. Install the MMS server RPM package.

#. Configure the MMS server's URL and email addresses.

#. Start up MMS server.

Links to configure the MMS application and start MMS are at the bottom of
this tutorial.

Prerequisites
-------------

Contact a MongoDB representative to obtain the current stable |monitoring|
release. MMS is available in DEB packages for Debian, Ubuntu, and related
systems; RPM for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, and related
systems; as well as ``tar.gz`` and ``zip`` packages.

You can also download the latest On-Prem Monitoring releases from
<http://www.mongodb.com/commercialsupport/downloads> as an RPM package.

Confirm your environment meets the :doc:`/management/requirements`.

Procedures
----------

Install and Start MongoDB System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the :manual:`MongoDB Installation tutorials </installation>` for
complete instructions on this procedure.

Install the MMS Software Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install |monitoring| from the provided ``tar.gz`` or ``zip``
archive without making any changes to the underlying system
(i.e. without creating users.)  To install, extract the package, as in
the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    tar -zxf mongodb-mms-<version>.x86_64.tar.gz

Optionally create a symlink in ``/etc/init.d`` to the included control
script for convenience, as in the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo ln -s <install_dir>/bin/mongodb-mms /etc/init.d/

Note, when the app is first started, it will create and store an encryption
key in ``$HOME/.mongodb-mms`` for the app user.
