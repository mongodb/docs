Overview
--------

To access |a-mms| organization or the project within that organization,
|a-mms| user must be a member of that organization. Depending on the
user's :ref:`role in the organization <organization-roles>`, the |mms|
user may be required to be a member of the project as well to access a
project.

|A-mms| user can be a member of multiple projects and multiple
organizations. If |a-mms| user is a member of a project, the user's
access to the project is determined by the user's :ref:`project role
<project-roles>`.

Within an organization, you can group users into teams. Users can
belong to multiple teams. Teams can be assigned to multiple projects.
The team's :ref:`project role <project-roles>` sets the team members'
access to the project.

.. note::

   |mms| users are separate from :doc:`MongoDB users
   </tutorial/manage-mongodb-users>`.

Create |mms| Users
------------------

.. cond:: cloud

   Users can create accounts using:

   - The |mms| `account registration page <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/register>`_
     or
   - `jira.mongodb.org <http://jira.mongodb.org/>`_.

   .. note::

      If you create an account in |jira| or make any changes to that
      account from *within* |jira|, it can take up to 30 minutes for
      that change to propagate to |mms|. During this window you cannot
      add the user to a project in |mms|. Also, passwords changed in
      |jira| are subject to the same propagation delay for |mms|
      accounts.

.. cond:: onprem

   If your |mms| installation has disabled 
   :setting:`Invitation Only Mode`, 
   users can create accounts using the |mms| account registration page 
   without an invite.

|mms| projects and organizations are invitation only. Users must receive
and accept an invitation from the |application| to join a project or
organization.

- To invite a new user to a project, see :ref:`add-users-to-project`.
- To invite a new user to an organization, see 
  :ref:`add-users-to-org`.
