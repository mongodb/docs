Use Active Voice

Active voice makes the *performer* of the action (usually the user) the
subject of the sentence. Passive voice makes the *recipient* of the
action (not the performer) the subject of the sentence.

Active-voice sentences are more engaging, less complicated, less wordy,
and easier to understand than passive-voice sentences. With active
voice, the actions and responses of the user are easier to distinguish
from the actions and responses of the technology.

You can use passive voice when using active voice:

-  Sounds like you're blaming the user. For
   example, you can use passive voice in an error message or
   troubleshooting content when the active subject is the user.
-  Makes the sentence wordy or awkward.
-  Would emphasize the performer when you don't know the performer of
   action or you want to de-emphasize the performer in favor the object
   on which the action is performed.
