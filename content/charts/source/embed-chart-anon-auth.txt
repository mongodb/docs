You can embed a chart in a web application and not require authentication
to view chart data. To restrict access to your embedded chart, see the
:ref:`authenticated embedded chart tutorials <authenticated-embedding-tutorials>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

- You must be a dashboard :ref:`Author <dashboard-permissions>` to enable
  unauthenticated embedding for a chart.
- :ref:`create-new-dashboard`
- :ref:`create-new-chart`

Procedures
----------

.. _anon-embedding-procedure:

Enable Unauthenticated Embedding for a Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable unauthenticated embedding to generate a chart ID and |charts-short|
Base URL. You will need your chart ID and |charts-short| Base URL to 
display your chart on a web page.

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-embedding-sdk-anon.rst

Create a Web App to Display Your Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you already have an app in which to display your chart, you're ready
to add an unauthenticated embedded chart. If not, proceed with the 
remaining steps to create a new app.

.. include:: /includes/fact-create-web-app-anon-chart.rst

Clone the :github:`GitHub repository </mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/>`
to get all the example apps. Instructions for running the 
unauthenticated example are in the :github:`Readme
</mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/tree/master/examples/charts/unauthenticated>` file in the ``unauthenticated`` directory. You can 
run the app as-is, or you can customize it to use a chart of your own.

Customize the Node.js App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the lines you need to edit are marked with a comment containing
``~REPLACE~``.

.. include:: /includes/steps/customize-anon-auth-app.rst

After you finish customizing the app, it's ready to run.
