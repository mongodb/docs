Definition
----------

.. pipeline:: $count

   .. versionadded:: 3.4

   Passes a document to the next stage that contains a count of the
   number of documents input to the stage.

Compatibility
-------------

.. |operator-method| replace:: ``$count``

.. include:: /includes/fact-compatibility.rst

Syntax
------

:pipeline:`$count` has the following prototype form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $count: <string> }

``<string>`` is the name of the output field which has the count
as its value. ``<string>`` must be a non-empty string, must not
start with ``$`` and must not contain the ``.`` character.

.. seealso::

   - :method:`db.collection.countDocuments()`
   - :pipeline:`$collStats`
   - :method:`db.collection.estimatedDocumentCount()`
   - :dbcommand:`count`
   - :method:`db.collection.count()`

Behavior
--------

The :pipeline:`$count` stage is equivalent to the following
:pipeline:`$group` + :pipeline:`$project` sequence:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.aggregate( [
      { $group: { _id: null, myCount: { $sum: 1 } } },
      { $project: { _id: 0 } }
   ] )

where ``myCount`` would be the output field that contains the count.
You can specify another name for the output field.

.. seealso::

   :method:`db.collection.countDocuments()` which wraps the
   :pipeline:`$group` aggregation stage with a :group:`$sum` expression.

Example
-------

A collection named ``scores`` has the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "subject" : "History", "score" : 88 }
   { "_id" : 2, "subject" : "History", "score" : 92 }
   { "_id" : 3, "subject" : "History", "score" : 97 }
   { "_id" : 4, "subject" : "History", "score" : 71 }
   { "_id" : 5, "subject" : "History", "score" : 79 }
   { "_id" : 6, "subject" : "History", "score" : 83 }

The following aggregation operation has two stages:

#. The :pipeline:`$match` stage excludes documents that have a
   ``score`` value of less than or equal to ``80`` to pass along the
   documents with ``score`` greater than ``80`` to the next
   stage.

#. The ``$count`` stage returns a count of the remaining documents
   in the aggregation pipeline and assigns the value to a field called
   ``passing_scores``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.scores.aggregate(
     [
       {
         $match: {
           score: {
             $gt: 80
           }
         }
       },
       {
         $count: "passing_scores"
       }
     ]
   )

The operation returns the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "passing_scores" : 4 }
