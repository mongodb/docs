===============================
Remove Members from Replica Set
===============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You may remove a member of a replica set at any time; *however*, for best
results always *shut down* the :program:`mongod` instance before
removing it from a  replica set.

.. versionchanged:: 2.2
   Before 2.2, you *had* to shut down the :program:`mongod` instance
   before removing it. While 2.2 removes this  requirement, it remains
   good practice.

To remove a member, use the
:method:`rs.remove()` method in the :program:`mongo` shell while
connected to the current :term:`primary`. Issue the
:method:`db.isMaster()` command when connected to *any* member of the
set to determine the current primary. Use a command in either
of the following forms to remove the member:

.. code-block:: javascript

   rs.remove("mongo2.example.net:27017")
   rs.remove("mongo3.example.net")

This operation disconnects the shell briefly and forces a
re-connection as the :term:`replica set` renegotiates which member
will be primary. The shell displays an error even if this
command succeeds.

You can re-add a removed member to a replica set at any time using the
:doc:`procedure for adding replica set members </tutorial/expand-replica-set>`.
Additionally, consider using the :ref:`replica set reconfiguration procedure
<replica-set-reconfiguration-usage>` to change the
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].host` value to rename a member in a replica set
directly.
