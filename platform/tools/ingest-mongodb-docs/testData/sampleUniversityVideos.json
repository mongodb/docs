developer\ndata platform, and how\n\n4\n00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,600\nit makes working with data\neasy for a wide variety\n\n5\n00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,830\nof applications.\n\n6\n00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,440\nWe'll also cover the\ncomponents of the platform that\n\n7\n00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,530\naddress common requirements\nof modern applications.\n\n8\n00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,720\nThis means there's\nless need to introduce\n\n9\n00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,750\nadditional technologies that\nmay complicate your development\n\n10\n00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,260\nprocess.\n\n11\n00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,230\nLet's begin by reviewing\nhow your data is\n\n12\n00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,120\nstored in MongoDB Atlas.\n\n13\n00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,330\nAtlas is our comprehensive\ndeveloper data platform.\n\n14\n00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,170\nAt its core is Atlas database,\nour database as a service.\n\n15\n00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,300\nThis means that when\nyou're using Atlas,\n\n16\n00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,640\nyou don't need to\nmanage MongoDB yourself.\n\n17\n00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,520\nInstead, Atlas will manage\nthe database for you\n\n18\n00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,760\nand handle all of the lifecycle\ndetails behind the scenes.\n\n19\n00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,040\nWhen using Atlas, your\ndatabase deployments\n\n20\n00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,590\nhave built-in replication,\nor what MongoDB\n\n21\n00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,640\nrefers to as a replica set.\n\n22\n00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,340\nThis means that\nyour data is stored\n\n23\n00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,940\non more than one server, which\nis a core tenet of MongoDB.\n\n24\n00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,370\nThis ensures both\ndata redundancy,\n\n25\n00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,830\nand that your data will\nbe available in the event\n\n26\n00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,480\nof a server failure.\n\n27\n00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,300\nIn Atlas, there are two types\nof database deployments--\n\n28\n00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,210\nserverless instances\nand clusters.\n\n29\n00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,460\nA serverless instance\nscales on demand\n\n30\n00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,640\nand only charges you for\nthe resources that you use.\n\n31\n00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,070\nServerless instances\nare a great option\n\n32\n00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,370\nfor applications with highly\nvariable or sparse workloads\n\n33\n00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,180\nover time.\n\n34\n00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,860\nThis is a much\nsimpler choice if you\n\n35\n00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,300\ndon't know what\nhardware you need,\n\n36\n00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,910\nor if you just want to use\na serverless architecture\n\n37\n00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,230\nin general.\n\n38\n00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,690\nA cluster is several MongoDB\nservers working together.\n\n39\n00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,520\nThere are two cluster\noptions, shared and dedicated.\n\n40\n00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,310\nShared clusters are smaller\nand include a free tier\n\n41\n00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,100\noption, which is a great way\nto get started with Atlas.\n\n42\n00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,020\nIt has over 100,000 new\ndeployments per month.\n\n43\n00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,510\nSo rest assured that if\nyou choose this option,\n\n44\n00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,800\nyou can run your small\nprojects on it indefinitely.\n\n45\n00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,500\nFinally, dedicated\nclusters are larger\n\n46\n00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,110\ndedicated resources\nand can be customized\n\n47\n00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,770\nto your specific needs.\n\n48\n00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,150\nThere are options for both low\nand high traffic applications\n\n49\n00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,730\nthat have cluster scaling\nenabled by default,\n\n50\n00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,260\nas well as enhanced\nsecurity features.\n\n51\n00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,820\nThis is the preferred choice\nfor production workloads.\n\n52\n00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,680\nWhen deploying your\ncluster on Atlas,\n\n53\n00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,300\nyou can choose from a\nnumber of cloud providers,\n\n54\n00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,680\nincluding AWS, Google\nCloud, and Microsoft Azure,\n\n55\n00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,200\nin over 100 geographic regions.\n\n56\n00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,290\nYou can deploy globally across\nmultiple regions or even\n\n57\n00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,550\nmultiple clouds.\n\n58\n00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,220\nAs your needs change,\nso can your cluster.\n\n59\n00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,310\nYou always have the option\nto change your scaling tier,\n\n60\n00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,320\nregion, or cloud provider.\n\n61\n00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,520\nAtlas will make these changes\nfor you without any downtime.\n\n62\n00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,400\nAtlas includes operational\ninsights and backups\n\n63\n00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,080\nwith point-in-time restore.\n\n64\n00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,140\nIt also has capabilities\nuseful for later stages\n\n65\n00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,000\nof the lifecycle,\nlike built-in data\n\n66\n00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,950\ntiering with online archive.\n\n67\n00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,170\nYou can learn more\nabout online archive\n\n68\n00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,760\nin one of our advanced\ncourses when you're ready.\n\n69\n00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,000\nYou can also manage\neverything from the command\n\n70\n00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,620\nline using the Atlas CLI\nor the administration API.\n\n71\n00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,430\nMongoDB Atlas is more than\njust a database as a service.\n\n72\n00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,230\nIt's a comprehensive\ndeveloper data platform.\n\n73\n00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,400\nIt provides an integrated\nsuite of products and services\n\n74\n00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,920\nthat developers can use\nto build applications\n\n75\n00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,030\nfaster than ever before.\n\n76\n00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,510\nLet's quickly discuss\nsome of the other services\n\n77\n00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,460\navailable in Atlas.\n\n78\n00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,460\nAtlas Search enables you to\nbuild rich search experiences\n\n79\n00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,170\non top of your\ndata in the cloud.\n\n80\n00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,390\nThere's no need for a\nseparate search engine.\n\n81\n00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,130\nYou can actually\naccess everything\n\n82\n00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,550\nfrom MongoDB's aggregation\nquery interface simply\n\n83\n00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,560\nby using the search operator.\n\n84\n00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,840\nAtlas device sync\nallows you to keep data\n\n85\n00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,690\nin sync between the cloud and\nmobile or other edge devices.\n\n86\n00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,160\nThis means that you can deliver\nrich, always-on experiences\n\n87\n00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,510\nanywhere.\n\n88\n00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,120\nAtlas Data Lake lets you\nautomatically extract\n\n89\n00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,080\ndata from your Atlas databases\nto your own low cost, fully\n\n90\n00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,030\nmanaged data lake environment.\n\n91\n00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,130\nOur Data Lake uses\na format that's\n\n92\n00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,020\noptimized for\nanalytical queries.\n\n93\n00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,460\nAtlas Data Federation allows you\nto seamlessly query, transform,\n\n94\n00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,450\naggregate, and write data from\nAtlas databases, Atlas Data\n\n95\n00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,470\nLakes, or your own cloud\nobject storage environments.\n\n96\n00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,050\nAtlas Charts is a built-in\ndata visualization tool.\n\n97\n00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,160\nIt allows you to easily\ncreate, share, and embed\n\n98\n00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,430\nrich dashboards built from\nyour own data in the cloud.\n\n99\n00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,780\nFinally, Atlas App Services\noffers a set of capabilities\n\n100\n00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,580\nthat allow you to build faster.\n\n101\n00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,920\nIt includes a data\nAPI, which enables\n\n102\n00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,870\nyou to read and\nwrite data in Atlas\n\n103\n00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,210\nwith standard HTTPS requests.\n\n104\n00:04:31,210 -->

--> 00:01:39,270\nfor our instance.\n\n38\n00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,060\nFor this particular\ncase, we'll be using AWS,\n\n39\n00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,620\nbut feel free to use GCP or\nAzure as your project dictates.\n\n40\n00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,610\nToday I'm in our\nNew York office,\n\n41\n00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,330\nso I'm going to go ahead\nand use the us-east region,\n\n42\n00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,900\nbut feel free to use whichever\nregion is appropriate for you.\n\n43\n00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,760\nScrolling further\ndown the page, you\n\n44\n00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,910\ncan see that there's even\nmore configuration settings.\n\n45\n00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,240\nFirst, let's check\nout the cluster here.\n\n46\n00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,693\nToday we're going to be\nusing the free tier, M0.\n\n47\n00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,110\nBut if you ever\nfeel that you want\n\n48\n00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,970\nto upgrade to one\nof our paid tiers,\n\n49\n00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,830\nyou can move to the\nM2 or M5 quite easily.\n\n50\n00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:18,277\nYou can also move to the M10 or\nhigher dedicated tier as well.\n\n51\n00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:20,110\nNext, let's move to our\nAdditional Settings.\n\n52\n00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,410\nHere, you can see\nthat we can turn\n\n53\n00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,530\non the backup setting for\nM2 and above clusters.\n\n54\n00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,600\nAgain, we'll be on\nM0, so we don't need\n\n55\n00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,950\nto worry about turning this on.\n\n56\n00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,430\nFinally, we can customize\nthe cluster name.\n\n57\n00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,260\nFor our example\ntoday, we'll go ahead\n\n58\n00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,840\nand leave the default\ncluster name of Cluster0\n\n59\n00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,000\nas our selection.\n\n60\n00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,475\nFrom here, we'll go ahead\nand click on Create Cluster.\n\n61\n00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,020\nAfter creating our\ninstance, we'll\n\n62\n00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,330\nbe brought to the\nSecurity Quickstart page.\n\n63\n00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,610\nAs a default, MongoDB is created\nwith no users and no IP address\n\n64\n00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,370\nthat's allowed to access that\ndatabase outside of the Atlas\n\n65\n00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,880\nsystem itself.\n\n66\n00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,760\nSo to get started,\nwe're going to need\n\n67\n00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,470\nto create an\nadministrative user,\n\n68\n00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,800\nas well as create an access\npoint for our IP address.\n\n69\n00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,580\nLet's go ahead and start\nwith the administrative user.\n\n70\n00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,500\nIn the username and\npassword section,\n\n71\n00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,270\nI'll go ahead and create\nan admin and a password.\n\n72\n00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,640\nAfter doing so, go ahead\nand click on Create User\n\n73\n00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,180\nto create this new\nadministrative user.\n\n74\n00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,400\nAs you can see, we've\ncreated our new username\n\n75\n00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,960\nand authentication\ntype for this user.\n\n76\n00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,880\nLet's go ahead and scroll down\nto the IP address section.\n\n77\n00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,880\nAs I stated previously,\nMongoDB blocks access\n\n78\n00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,940\nfrom all IP addresses,\nexcept for Atlas itself.\n\n79\n00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,400\nIn order to be able\nto work with MongoDB\n\n80\n00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,590\nfrom your local\nmachine, you'll need\n\n81\n00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,220\nto put your IP address\non the access list.\n\n82\n00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,560\nTo do so, you can go\nahead and click on the Add\n\n83\n00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,100\nMy Current IP Address button.\n\n84\n00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,340\nAdditionally, if you want\nto add other IP addresses,\n\n85\n00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,130\nyou can use this menu as well.\n\n86\n00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,170\nAfter adding your\nIP address, go ahead\n\n87\n00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,620\nand click on Finish and Close.\n\n88\n00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,500\nGo ahead and click\non Go to Databases.\n\n89\n00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,630\nAfter finishing with\nyour security quickstart,\n\n90\n00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,190\nyou'll be brought back to the\ndatabase deployment screen.\n\n91\n00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,300\nYou'll notice that we don't have\ndata in the database so far.\n\n92\n00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,329\nTo add new data, we're going to\ngo ahead and load a sample data\n\n93\n00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,050\nset.\n\n94\n00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,720\nTo do so, go ahead and\nclick on the ellipsis\n\n95\n00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,240\nnext to Browse\nCollections, and then\n\n96\n00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,860\nclick on Load Sample Dataset.\n\n97\n00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,100\nThis will bring up another\nmodal box in which you can also\n\n98\n00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,360\nclick on Load Sample Dataset.\n\n99\n00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,750\nOnce you do so, you'll\nstart loading sample data\n\n100\n00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,010\ninto your database.\n\n101\n00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,800\nThis process will take a few\nminutes, so feel free to go\n\n102\n00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,230\ngrab a coffee or a tea, and\njust take a short break.\n\n103\n00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,020\nOnce Atlas has successfully\nfinished uploading your sample\n\n104\n00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,920\ndata, you'll be able to view\nthat data in the Data Explorer.\n\n105\n00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,040\nTo do so, let's go ahead and\nclick on Browse Collections.\n\n106\n00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,190\nThis will open\nAtlas Data Explorer,\n\n107\n00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,710\nwhich will allow\nyou to view, filter,\n\n108\n00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,730\nand even modify your data.\n\n109\n00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,230\nOn the left-hand\nmenu, you'll see\n\n110\n00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,170\na listing of all the databases\navailable within your cluster.\n\n111\n00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,550\nFor example, we've got the\nsample airbnb database, as well\n\n112\n00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,340\nas the sample\nanalytics database.\n\n113\n00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,180\nLet's go ahead and click on\nthe sample analytics database.\n\n114\n00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,620\nThis will then\nbring us to a view\n\n115\n00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,300\nin which we can see\nall the collections\n\n116\n00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,040\navailable within that database.\n\n117\n00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,320\nIf we want to view the documents\nwithin a particular collection,\n\n118\n00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,070\nwe can click on the\nname of the collection\n\n119\n00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,730\nwithin the left-hand menu or\non the name of that collection\n\n120\n00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,740\nin the view on the right side.\n\n121\n00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,320\nLet's go ahead and take a look\nat our accounts collection.\n\n122\n00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,270\nAs we can see, we can\nview the documents\n\n123\n00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,580\nthat exist within the accounts\ncollection from this view.\n\n124\n00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,600\nWhat if we want to filter down\nto a specific account value,\n\n125\n00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,620\nthough?\n\n126\n00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,550\nWe can use the filter bar to\nspecify a particular query\n\n127\n00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,220\nin order to find a\nspecific document.\n\n128\n00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,770\nFor example, what if I\nwanted to find a document\n\n129\n00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,270\nby its account_id field?\n\n130\n00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,510\nWe can enter a filter\ndocument for an account id\n\n131\n00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,490\nfield of 794875.\n\n132\n00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,230\nTo apply this\nfilter to our data,\n\n133\n00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,300\nwe'll go ahead and click\non the Apply button.\n\n134\n00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,180\nWe can see that this reduces\nour view to a single document\n\n135\n00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,370\nwithin the collection.\n\n136\n00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,080\nNow that you've\nlearned how to filter\n\n137\n00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,300\nfor specific documents\nwithin a collection,\n\n138\n00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,850\nas well as selecting\ncollections and databases\n\n139\n00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,980\nwithin your cluster,\nyou're ready to start\n\n140\n00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,340\nworking with the Data\nExplorer in Atlas.\n\n141\n00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,530\nLet's quickly recap what we\naccomplished in this video.\n\n142\n00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,580\nWe set up an Atlas account\nand deployed our first Atlas\n\n143\n00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,510\ncluster.\n\n144\n00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:49,080\nWe then set up a database\nuser and added our IP address\n\n145\n00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,220\nto the IP access list.\n\n146\n00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,330\nFinally, we used the Data\nExplorer to load and view\n\n147\n00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,390\nour sample data.",
