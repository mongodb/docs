   .. step:: Navigate to 
      `the Database Deployments page <https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2>`__ 
      for your project.

      .. procedure::
         :style: connected
          
          .. step:: If it is not already displayed, select the 
             organization that contains your desired project from the 
             :guilabel:`Organizations` menu in the navigation bar.

          .. step:: If it is not already displayed, select your desired 
             project from the :guilabel:`Projects` menu in the 
             navigation bar.

          .. step:: If the :guilabel:`Database Deployments` page is not 
             already displayed, click :guilabel:`Databases` in the
