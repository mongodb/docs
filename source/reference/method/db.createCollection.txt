db.createCollection()
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. method:: db.createCollection(name, options)

   Creates a new collection explicitly.

   Because MongoDB creates a collection implicitly when the collection
   is first referenced in a command, this method is used primarily for
   creating new :term:`capped collections <capped collection>`. This is
   also used to pre-allocate space for an ordinary collection.

   The :method:`db.createCollection()` method has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.createCollection(name, {capped: <boolean>, autoIndexId: <boolean>, size: <number>, max: <number>} )

   The :method:`db.createCollection()` method has the following parameters:

   .. include:: /reference/method/db.createCollection-param.rst

   The ``options`` document creates a capped collection or preallocates
   space in a new ordinary collection. The ``options`` document contains
   the following fields:

   .. include:: /reference/method/db.createCollection-options-param.rst

Example
-------

The following example creates a capped collection. Capped collections
have maximum size or document counts that prevent them from growing
beyond maximum thresholds. All capped collections must specify a maximum
size and may also specify a maximum document count. MongoDB removes
older documents if a collection reaches the maximum size limit before it
reaches the maximum document count. Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection("log", { capped : true, size : 5242880, max : 5000 } )

This command creates a collection named ``log`` with a maximum size of 5
megabytes and a maximum of 5000 documents.

The following command simply pre-allocates a 2-gigabyte, uncapped
collection named ``people``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.createCollection("people", { size: 2147483648 } )

This command provides a wrapper around the database command
:dbcommand:`create`. See :doc:`/core/capped-collections` for more
information about capped collections.
