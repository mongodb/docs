Overview
--------

You can call a :ref:`Function <functions>` from a connected client application.

The examples in this section demonstrate calling a simple function named
``sum`` that takes two arguments, adds them, and returns the result:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/web/call-a-function.test.snippet.function.js
   :language: javascript

Usage
-----

In the Node SDK you call Functions as a logged in user with the
``User.functions`` interface. There are two ways to call a function:

- You can call a function as if was a method defined locally on the
  ``User.functions`` interface.

- You can call the ``User.functions.callFunction()`` method to call a function
  by providing its stringified name and a list of arguments.
