Overview
--------

MongoDB supports query operations that perform a text search of string
content. To perform text search, MongoDB uses a
:ref:`text index <index-feature-text>` and the :query:`$text` operator.

Example
-------

This example demonstrates how to build a text index and use it to find
coffee shops, given only text fields.

Create a collection ``stores`` with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.stores.insert(
      [
        { _id: 1, name: "Java Hut", description: "Coffee and cakes" },
        { _id: 2, name: "Burger Buns", description: "Gourmet hamburgers" },
        { _id: 3, name: "Coffee Shop", description: "Just coffee" },
        { _id: 4, name: "Clothes Clothes Clothes", description: "Discount clothing" },
        { _id: 5, name: "Java Shopping", description: "Indonesian goods" }
      ]
   )

``$text`` Operator

Exact Phrase
````````````

You can also search for exact phrases by wrapping them in double-quotes.
If the ``$search`` string includes a phrase and individual terms, text search
will only match documents that include the phrase.

For example, the following will find all documents containing
"coffee shop":

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.stores.find( { $text: { $search: "\"coffee shop\"" } } )

For more information, see :ref:`text-operator-phrases`.

Term Exclusion
``````````````

To exclude a word, you can prepend a "``-``" character. For example, to
find all stores containing "java" or "shop" but not "coffee", use the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.stores.find( { $text: { $search: "java shop -coffee" } } )

Sorting
```````

MongoDB will return its results in unsorted order by default. However,
text search queries will compute a relevance score for each document
that specifies how well a document matches the query.

To sort the results in order of relevance score, you must explicitly
project the :projection:`$meta` ``textScore`` field and sort on it:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.stores.find(
      { $text: { $search: "java coffee shop" } },
      { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }
   ).sort( { score: { $meta: "textScore" } } )

Text search is also available in the aggregation pipeline.

Language Support
----------------

MongoDB supports text search for various languages. See
:doc:`/reference/text-search-languages` for a list of supported
languages.
