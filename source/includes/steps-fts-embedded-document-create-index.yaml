  You can create an |fts| index that uses :ref:`dynamic mappings 
  <static-dynamic-mappings>` or :ref:`static mappings 
  <static-dynamic-mappings>`. To learn more about dynamic and static 
  mappings, see :ref:`static-dynamic-mappings`.
  
  The following index definition dynamically indexes the fields of 
  :ref:`supported types <bson-data-chart>` in the ``movies`` 
  collection. You can use the |fts| :guilabel:`Visual Editor` or the |fts|
  :guilabel:`JSON Editor` in the |service| user interface to create the 
  index.
  
  Visual Editor

  a. Click :guilabel:`Next`.
  #. Review the default index definition for the ``movies`` 
     collection.

  JSON Editor
  +++++++++++

  a. Click :guilabel:`Next`.
  #. Review the index definition.
     
     Your index definition should look similar to the following: 

     .. code-block:: json 
                    
        {
          "mappings": {
            "dynamic": true
          }
        }

     The above index definition dynamically indexes the fields of 
     :ref:`supported types <bson-data-chart>` in each document in 
     the ``movies`` collection. 

  #. Click :guilabel:`Next`.
