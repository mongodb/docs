We're currently rolling out a new and improved navigation 
experience. If the steps in the documentation don't match your view in 
the {+atlas-ui+}, see :dochub:`the preview documentation 
<atlas-nav-previews>`.

Why are we making this change?
------------------------------

We redesigned the navigation to provide a more composable and scalable 
structure so that our developer data platform can grow over time. We 
redesigned the navigation to improve the self-discovery of the wide 
array of services we offer and to provide clear navigation across 
services and resources. Ultimately, these changes set a foundation to 
support the growth of our products and services over time.

What's changing?
----------------

- We simplified the left sidebar navigation. We organized the sidebar 
  navigation into the following categories:

  - :guilabel:`Database`
  - :guilabel:`Data`
  - :guilabel:`Services`
  - :guilabel:`Security`
  
  These categories provide distinct yet flexible containers that 
  display the breadth of our platform services and a clear division 
  between the main tasks.

- We clarified the resource context. The top navigation persists and 
  indicates the current resource (organization, project, 
  collection, and so on). You can easily switch between resources to 
  improve workflow continuity.

- We unified utilities. A centralized utility hub in the top-right 
  corner of the UI provides quick and easy access to essential tools 
  like alerts, the activity feed, support, and user management. You can 
  also find links to MongoDB University, Documentation, and 
  Community Forums here.

- We removed the distinct product tabs. We now present all primary 
  services in the appropriate category beneath one consolidated sidebar 
  navigation, which makes these capabilities easier to find. We removed 
  the top navigation tabs for :guilabel:`Data Services` and 
  :guilabel:`Charts`. We changed the label for :guilabel:`Charts` to 
  :guilabel:`Visualizations`.
