Connect to a Cloud Server through SSH
=====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

A cloud server provisioned through |mms| integration with a supported
service provider is accessible through its hostname as listed on the
:guilabel:`Deployment` page. You can use an SSH operation to connect to
the server. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   ssh -i <ssh-key> <username>@<hostsring>.mongodbdns.com

|mms| supports provisioning integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and
Microsoft Azure.

Prerequisites
-------------

If you provision servers through **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, you must
meet the following prerequisites:

- The AWS :ref:`security group <security-group>` assigned to the AWS
  server must allow SSH access from your IP address. For more information,
  see :ref:`security-group`.

- To connect to the AWS server through SSH, you must have the public key that
  matches the shared private key you created when provisioning the
  server. To provide |mms| with a public key for use when provisioning
  servers, see :doc:`/tutorial/nav/provision-cloud-servers`.
