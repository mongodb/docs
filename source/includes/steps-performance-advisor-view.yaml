   The :guilabel:`Performance Advisor` displays up to 20 query shapes
   across all collections in the cluster and suggested indexes for those
   shapes. The indexes are ranked according to their :guilabel:`Impact`
   score, which estimates the improvement in total operational latency
   across the cluster that creating the index would cause. For
   more information on index ranking, see :ref:`pa-index-ranking`.

   .. note::

      The Performance Advisor collects existing indexes for collections
      with slow queries every six hours. However, the Performance
      Advisor generates suggested indexes based on actual queries
      within five minutes of query execution. It is possible to see
      suggestions for indexes that you have already created, but these
      are removed the next time that the Performance Advisor collects
      indexes.
