=============================
Set Which Fields Are Returned
=============================

.. meta::
   :description: Specify which fields to return in query results using the Project option in MongoDB Compass.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

If the query bar displays the :guilabel:`Project` option, you can
specify which fields to return in the resulting data. By default, all
fields are returned.

To set a projection:

#. In the Query Bar, click :guilabel:`Options`.

#. Enter the projection document into the :guilabel:`Project` field.

   To include fields:
     Specify the field name and set to ``1`` in the project document.

     .. example::

        .. code-block:: javascript

           { year: 1, name: 1 }

        Only the fields specified in the project document are returned.
        The ``_id`` field is returned unless it is set to  ``0`` in the
        :guilabel:`Project` document.

   To exclude fields:
     Specify the field name and set to ``0`` in the project document.

     .. example::

        .. code-block:: javascript

           { year: 0, name: 0 }

        All fields except for the fields specified in the project
        document are returned.

   As you type, the :guilabel:`Find` button is disabled and the
   :guilabel:`Project` label turns red until a valid query is entered.

How Does the |compass-short| Query Compare to MongoDB and SQL Queries?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

:pipeline:`$project` corresponds to choosing specific fields to return
in a |sql| ``SELECT`` statement.

.. example::

   You have 3,235 articles. You would like to see only the headlines
   and authors of those articles.

   SQL
      .. code-block:: sql

         SELECT headline, author FROM article;

   MongoDB Aggregation
      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.article.aggregate(
           { $project : { headline : 1, author : 1 } }
         );

   |compass-short| Project Option
      .. code-block:: javascript

         { headline : 1, author : 1 }
