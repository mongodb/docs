PyMongo supports both CPython and PyPy.

When a version of Python is marked end-of-life (EOL), the next minor release of
PyMongo drops support for that version. The driver offers the
following ongoing support for EOL Python versions:

- **CPython**: The last minor PyMongo version compatible with the EOL CPython
  version receives critical bug fixes for one year.

- **PyPy**: PyMongo doesn't support PyPy versions past their EOL date.
