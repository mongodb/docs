Overview
--------

|mms| sends an alert notification when a specified
:doc:`alert condition </reference/alerts>` occurs, such as an
unresponsive host or an outdated agent. To view all alert 
notifications, click :guilabel:`Alerts` in |mms|.

When a condition triggers an alert, you receive the alert at regular
intervals until the alert resolves or |mms| cancels it. You can
acknowledge an alert for a period of time, but if the alert condition
persists, you will again receive notifications once the acknowledgment
period ends.

You can temporarily suspend alerts on a resource by creating an alert
:ref:`maintenance window <suspend-alerts-during-maintenance-window>`.
For example, you can create a maintenance window
that suspends host alerts while you shut down hosts for maintenance.

.. _resolved-alert:

Resolved Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alerts resolve when the alert condition no longer applies. For example,
if a replica set's :term:`primary` goes down, |mms| issues an alert
that the replica set does not have a primary. When a new primary is
elected, the alert condition no longer applies, and the alert will
resolve. |mms| sends a notification of the alert's resolution.

.. _cancelled-alert:

Cancelled Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| cancels an alert if the alert configuration that triggered the
alert is deleted, disabled, or edited, or if the open alert becomes
invalid. Some examples of an alert becoming invalid are:

- There is an open "Host Down" alert, and then you delete the target
  host.

- There is an open "Replication Lag" alert, and the target host becomes
  the primary.

- There is an open "Replica set has no primary" alert for a replica set
  whose name is "rs0," and the target replica set is renamed to "rs1."

When an alert is canceled, |mms| does **not** send a notification and
does not record an entry on the |mms| :guilabel:`Alerts` lists.

Retrieve the Activity Feed
--------------------------

You can retrieve events for a specified organization or project using
the :doc:`/reference/api/events/` |api| resource.

Acknowledge an Alert
--------------------

When you acknowledge the alert, |mms| sends no further notifications to
the alert's distribution list until the acknowledgement period has
passed or until the you resolve the alert. The distribution list
receives *no* notification of the acknowledgment.

If the alert condition ends during the acknowledgment period, |mms|
sends a notification of the resolution.

If you configure an alert with PagerDuty, a third-party incident
management service, you can only acknowledge the alert on your
PagerDuty dashboard.

Unacknowledge an Alert

You can undo an acknowledgment and again receive notifications if the
alert condition still applies.

.. _manage-host-alerts:

Disable Alerts for a Specific Process
-------------------------------------

You can turn off alerts for a given process. This might be useful, for
example, if you want to temporarily disable the process but do not want
it hidden from monitoring. Use the following procedure both to turn
alerts off or on.

.. _suspend-alerts-during-maintenance-window:

Suspend Alerts by Adding a Maintenance Window
---------------------------------------------

Specify maintenance windows to temporarily turn off alert notifications
for a given resource while you perform maintenance.
