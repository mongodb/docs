  In order to connect to MongoDB, you will need a :ref:`URI string
  <mongodb-uri>`. A ``URI`` (Uniform Resource Identifier) is similar to
  a URL, and is supplied as a parameter to the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
  shell, Compass, and the MongoDB drivers when connecting to a MongoDB
  deployment.

  .. important:: 
     
     If your connection string contains ``$[password]``, you will need
     to replace this string with your password. Use caution
     where you store and enter passwords, particularly when running from
     a shell or command prompt. Special characters in passwords must be
     escaped.
