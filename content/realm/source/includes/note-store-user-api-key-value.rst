.. warning:: Store the API Key Value
   
   The SDK only returns the value of the user API key when you create it. Make
   sure to store the ``key`` value securely so that you can use it to log in.
   
   If you lose or do not store the ``key`` value there is no way to recover it.
   You will need to create a new user API key.
