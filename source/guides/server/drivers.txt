   result_description:

     There are several ways to connect to your MongoDB instance. MongoDB
     officially supports 11 API languages, bundles its own ``mongo``
     shell, and provides a web-based client called Compass. The drivers,
     shell, and web client allow you to access MongoDB interactively and
     programmatically.
     
     This guide will step you through installation of the MongoDB shell
     and supported clients.
