   .. step:: Create a data model

      Run the following command from your project root to create a
      ``Restaurant`` model with ``name``, ``cuisine``, and ``borough``
      fields:

      .. code-block:: bash

         bin/rails g scaffold Restaurant name:string cuisine:string borough:string
      
      This command also creates the controller and view files for the
      ``Restaurant`` model. You can find the directories that contain
      these files in the ``app`` directory of your application.

   .. step:: Retrieve specific documents

      The ``app/controllers/restaurants_controller.rb`` file contains
      methods that specify how your app handles different
      requests. Replace the ``index`` method body with the following code:

      .. code-block:: ruby

         def index
           @restaurants = Restaurant
               .where(name: /earth/i)
         end

      This controller method retrieves ``Restaurant`` documents in which the
      value of the ``name`` field contains the string ``"earth"``. The
      results are rendered at the ``/restaurants`` route by default.

   .. step:: Start your Rails application

      Run the following command from the application root directory
      to start your {+language+} web server:

      .. code-block:: bash

         bin/rails s

      After the server starts, it outputs the following message
      indicating that the application is running on port ``3000``:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

   .. step:: View the restaurant data

      Open the URL http://127.0.2.2:3000/restaurants in your web browser.
      The page shows a list of restaurants and details about each of
      them:

      Rails provides a default interface that allows you to view, edit,
      and delete models. In the next section, you can learn how to use the
      interface to interact with MongoDB data.
