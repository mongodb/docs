   operations with MongoDB and :doc:`/core/replica-set-write-concern`
   for considerations specific to replica sets.

.. note:: The :doc:`driver write concern </release-notes/drivers-write-concern>`
   change created a new connection class in all of the MongoDB
   drivers, called ``MongoClient`` with a different default write
   concern. See the :doc:`release notes </release-notes/drivers-write-concern>`
   for this change, and the release notes for the driver you're using
   for more information about your driver's release.

Types of Write Concern
----------------------

Clients issue write operations with some level of :term:`write
concern`, which describes the level of concern or guarantee the server
will provide in its response to a write operation.  MongoDB has
the following levels of conceptual write concern, listed from weakest to
strongest:

.. _write-concern-errors-ignored:

Errors Ignored
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a *errors ignored* write concern, write operations are not
acknowledged by MongoDB. Write operations may not succeed in the case
of connection errors that the client is not yet aware of, or if the
:program:`mongod` produces an exception (e.g. a duplicate key
exception for :ref:`unique indexes <index-type-unique>`.) While this
operation is efficient because it does not require the database to
respond to every write operation, it also incurs a significant risk
with regards to the persistence and durability of the data.

.. warning::

   Do not use this option in normal operation.

.. _write-concern-unacknowledged:

Unacknowledged
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a *unacknowledged* write concern, MongoDB does not acknowledge
the receipt of write operation as with a write concern level of
*ignore*; however, the driver will receive and handle network errors,
as possible given system networking configuration.

Before the releases outlined in :ref:`driver-write-concern-change`,
this was the default write concern.

.. _write-concern-acknowledged:

Acknowledged
~~~~~~~~~~~~

With a receipt *acknowledged* write concern, the :program:`mongod`
confirms the receipt of the write operation. With this level of write
concern, clients can catch network, duplicate key, and other
exceptions.

This is the default write concern, after the releases outlined in
:ref:`driver-write-concern-change`.

Internally, the default write concern is to call
:dbcommand:`getLastError` with no arguments. For replica sets, you can
define the default write concern settings in the
:data:`~local.system.replset.settings.getLastErrorDefaults` If
:data:`~local.system.replset.settings.getLastErrorDefaults` does not
define a default write concern setting, :dbcommand:`getLastError`
defaults to basic receipt acknowledgment.

.. _write-concern-replica-journaled:

Journaled
~~~~~~~~~

With a *journaled* write concern, the :program:`mongod` will confirm
the write operation only after it has written the operation to the
:term:`journal`. This confirms that the write operation can survive a
:program:`mongod` shutdown and ensures that the write operation is
durable.

While receipt *acknowledged* without *journaled* provides the
fundamental basis for write concern, there is a window between
journal commits where the write operation is not fully durable. See
:setting:`journalCommitInterval` for more information on this
window. Require *journaled* as part of the write concern to provide
this durability guarantee.

.. _write-concern-replica-acknowledged:
.. _replica-set-write-concern:

Replica Acknowledged
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:term:`Replica sets <replica set>` present an additional layer of
consideration for write concern. Basic write concern levels affect the
write operation on only one :program:`mongod` instance. The ``w``
argument to :dbcommand:`getLastError` provides a *replica
acknowledged* level of write concern. With *replica acknowledged* you
can guarantee that the write operation has propagated to the members
of a replica set. See the :doc:`Write Concern for Replica Sets
<replica-set-write-concern>` document for more information.

.. note::

   Requiring *journaled* write concern in a replica set only requires
   a journal commit of the write operation to the :term:`primary` of the
   set regardless of the level of *replica acknowledged* write
   concern.
