Overview
--------

Database schemas occasionally need to be updated. For example, a schema 
designed to hold user contact information may need to be updated to 
include new methods of communication as they become popular, such as 
Twitter or Skype.

You can use MongoDB's flexible schema model, which supports differently 
shaped documents in the same collection, to gradually update your 
collection's schema. As you update your schema model, the Schema 
Versioning pattern allows you to track these updates with version 
numbers. Your application code can use version numbers to identify and 
handle differently shaped documents without downtime.

Schema Versioning Pattern
-------------------------

To implement the Schema Versioning pattern, add a ``schema_version`` 
(or similarly named) field to your schema the first time that you 
modify your schema. Documents that use the new schema should have a 
``schema_version`` of ``2`` to indicate that they adhere to the second 
iteration of your schema. If you update your schema again, increment 
the ``schema_version``.

Your application code can use a document's ``schema_version``, or lack 
thereof, to conditionally handle documents. Use the latest schema to 
store new information in the database.

Example
-------

The following example iterates upon the schema for documents in the 
``users`` collection.

In the first iteration of this schema, a record includes 
``galactic_id``, ``name``, and ``phone`` fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // users collection

   {
       "_id": "<ObjectId>",
       "galactic_id": 123,
       "name": "Anakin Skywalker",
       "phone": "503-555-0000",
   }

In the next iteration, the schema is updated to include more 
information in a different shape:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 13

   // users collection

   {
       "_id": "<ObjectId>",
       "galactic_id": 123,
       "name": "Darth Vader",
       "contact_method": {
           "work": "503-555-0210",
           "home": "503-555-0220",
           "twitter": "@realdarthvader",
           "skype": "AlwaysWithYou"
       },
       "schema_version": "2"
   }

Adding a ``schema_version`` means that an application can identify 
documents shaped for the new schema and handle them accordingly. The 
application can still handle old documents if ``schema_version`` does 
not exist on the document.

For example, consider an application that finds a user's phone number(s)
by ``galactic_id``. Upon being given a ``galactic_id``, the application 
needs to query the database:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.find( { galactic_id: 123 } );

After the document is returned from the database, the application checks
to see whether the document has a ``schema_version`` field.

- If it does not have a ``schema_version`` field, the application 
  passes the returned document to a dedicated function that renders the 
  ``phone`` field from the original schema.

- If it does have a ``schema_version`` field, the application checks
  the schema version. In this example, the ``schema_version`` is ``2`` 
  and the application passes the returned document to a dedicated 
  function that renders the new ``contact_method.work`` and 
  ``contact_method.home`` fields.

Using the ``schema_version`` field, application code can support any 
number of schema iterations in the same collection by adding dedicated 
handler functions to the code.

Use Cases
---------

The Schema Versioning pattern is ideal for any one or a combination of 
the following cases:

- Application downtime is not an option

- Updating documents may take hours, days, or weeks of time to complete

- Updating documents to the new schema version is not a requirement

The Schema Versioning pattern helps you better decide when and how data 
migrations will take place relative to traditional, tabular databases.
