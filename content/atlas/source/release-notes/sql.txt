.. note:: Release Notes Mention Only Releases with Feature Changes

   MongoDB releases {+sql-interface+} drivers and connectors in a continuous deployment 
   manner. This release cadence allows us to continuously improve {+sql-interface+} 
   performance and stability. These release notes capture only those 
   releases that contain direct user feature changes. If a particular {+sql-interface+} 
   release contains only performance and stability improvements, it is not included 
   in these release notes.

*Released November 24, 2025*

.. important::

   If you use Kerberos, |oidc|, or x509 authentication methods, upgrade to |jdbc| 
   3.0.4 or later and the Tableau custom connector to 1.4.5 or later.

- Updates the Tableau custom connector (for the MongoDB JDBC driver) to version 1.4.5.

  - Adds sections to the connection dialog for specific authentication mechanisms:
    :guilabel:`Username and Password`, :guilabel:`X509`, :guilabel:`GSSAPI`, and :guilabel:`OIDC`.

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 3.0.4.

  - Introduces support for |oidc| machine flow authentication. This enables 
    Tableau Server users to publish and refresh reports securely without relying 
    on embedded usernames and passwords. The driver now natively supports machine 
    flow authentication for |k8s|, |gcp|, and |azure| environments, via the ``authMechanismProperties`` connection |uri| parameter.
  
  - Introduces Kerberos support for Tableau Desktop. This includes the addition 
    of the following configuration properties: 
    
    - ``jaasconfigpath``
    - ``gssnativemode``
    - ``gssapilogincontextname``
    - ``gssapiserverauth``

*Released October 14, 2025*

- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 2.0.1.
- Fixes a local privilege escalation vulnerability (`CVE-2025-11575
  <https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-11575>`__) in the Windows installer by correcting permissions for custom installation paths.

*Released September 17, 2025*

- Introduces general availability of MongoDB {+sql-interface+}. This modern toolset 
  replaces the legacy |bic-full| and provides a unified and consistent set of SQL 
  drivers and connectors for both {+service+} and on-premises deployments. This 
  feature is now available for all MongoDB Enterprise Advanced customers with the 
  introduction of the schema builder for on-premises schema management.
  To learn more, see :ref:`connect-with-sql-overview`.
- Introduces {+schema-builder+} 1.1.0 for on-premises schema management. 
- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 2.0.0.
  
  - Introduces on-premises connectivity support.
  - Introduces support for Kerberos (GSSAPI) authentication, enabling
    secure connections in enterprise environments and providing a critical
    feature for users migrating from the legacy |bic-full|.
  - Fixes an issue that prevented tables from being listed when connecting 
    via certain tools, such as Microsoft SQL Server Linked Server. The 
    driver now correctly handles ``SQLTables`` calls with null ``TableType``
    parameters.

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 3.0.1.
  
  - Introduces on-premises connectivity support.

*Released August 12, 2025*

- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.4.6.

  to panic when a user with the minimum set of permissions retrieves the
  list of accessible tables.

*Released July 15, 2025*

- Updates the |odbc| driver to version 1.4.5.
- Updates |odbc| |oidc| default scope to send ``openid`` with 
  ``offline_access`` and only intersect with IdP reported scopes if the 
  set is not empty.
- Makes ``SQLEndTran`` a no-op.
- Updates the Rust driver to version 3.2.4.

*Released June 18, 2025*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to 2.3.0.

- Introduces a new property ``disableclientcache`` to disable client 
  caching in the JDBC driver. You must use this property with care and 
  it is intended for server environments where the |jdbc| driver is 
  used to connect to a variable number of customer databases to run 
  queries at varying frequencies.
  
  .. warning:: 
    
    To avoid recurring re-authentication flows, do not use this 
    property with the OIDC authentication mechanism.

*Released June 12, 2025*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.2.4.
- Fixes an issue with the |jdbc| driver so that it now rejects invalid 
  values for ``setFetchSize`` and provides a clear error message.

  example, Azure |oidc|).

*Released April 30, 2025*

- Releases version 2.2.0 of the JDBC driver.
- Introduces driver support for jBoss Log Manager for logging.
- Updates UUID string representation to the extended json uuid format 
  ``{$uuid : "val"}`` instead of the generic base64 binary data format 
  ``{ "$binary":{"base64": "base64val", "subType": "xx"}``.
  For ``subType 03``, you can use the :manual:`uuidRepresentation 
  </reference/connection-string/#mongodb-urioption-urioption.uuidRepresentation>` connection option.

  characters. To work with BI tools, like Microsoft SQL Server 
  Linked Server, which can't handle variable length 
  string data with no known maximum length, you must enable this option.
 
*Released April 24, 2024*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.1.2, which now 
  ignores both "true" and "false" ``setAutoCommit``
  values instead of returning an exception when "true".

  incompatibilities between ``Decimal128`` and ``SQL_DECIMAL``.

*Released February 23, 2024*

- Updates the |jdbc| driver to version 2.1.1, which removes
  the SnakeYaml dependency and fixes an issue introduced in version 2.1.0
  where data retrieved by column name
  was pointing to the incorrect index. The driver now retrieves the data under 
  the correct index or reports an error if there are duplicate column names.
