==================
$let (aggregation)
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. expression:: $let

   Binds :doc:`variables </reference/aggregation-variables>` for use in
   subexpressions. To access the variable in the subexpressions, use a
   string with the variable name prefixed with double dollar signs
   (``$$``).

   The :expression:`$let` expression has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: none

      {
        $let:
           {
             vars: { <var1>: <value1>, ... },
             in: { <expression using "$$var1", ...> }
           }
      }

   :returns: The value of the subexpression evaluated with the bound
      variables.

   See :doc:`/reference/aggregation-variables` for more information on
   using variables in the aggregation pipeline.

Behavior
--------

In the ``vars: { <var1>: <value1>, ... }`` assignment block, the order
of the assignment does not matter, and using ``$$var`` to access a
variable's value refers to the existing value, if any, of the variable.
Even if the variable is being reassigned, ``$$var`` would refer to the
current and not the reassigned value in the assignment block. 

For example, the following :expression:`$let` expression is invalid
since in the ``vars: { low: 1, high: "$$low" }`` assignment block,
``"$$low"`` refers to the pre-assignment value of the variable ``low``,
which is undefined:

.. code-block:: none

   {
     $let:
       {
         vars: { low: 1, high: "$$low" },
         in: { $gt: [ "$$low", "$$high" ] }
       }
   }

:expression:`$let` can access variables defined outside its expression
block, including :ref:`system variables <agg-system-variables>`. If you
modify the values of externally defined variables in the ``vars``
block, the new values take effect only in the ``in`` subexpression, and
the variables retain to their previous values outside the ``in``
subexpression.

Examples
--------

.. _let-in-project:

Project Values Calculated Using Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``sales`` collection has the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: 1, price: 10, tax: 0.50, applyDiscount: true }
   { _id: 2, price: 10, tax: 0.25, applyDiscount: false }

The following aggregation uses :expression:`$let` in the the
:pipeline:`$project` pipeline stage to calculate and return the
``finalTotal`` for each document:

.. code-block:: none

   db.sales.aggregate( [
      {
         $project: {
            finalTotal: {
               $let: {
                  vars: {
                     total: { $add: [ '$price', '$tax' ] },
                     discounted: { $cond: { if: '$applyDiscount', then: 0.9, else: 1 } }
                  },
                  in: { $multiply: [ "$$total", "$$discounted" ] }
               }
            }
         }
      }
   ] )

The aggregation returns the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "finalTotal" : 9.450000000000001 }
   { "_id" : 2, "finalTotal" : 10.25 }
