       - Description

       - Action

     * - :guilabel:`Snapshot`

       - Allows you to choose one :manual:`stored snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>`.

       - Select an existing :manual:`snapshot </reference/glossary/#std-term-snapshot>` to restore.

     * - :guilabel:`Point In Time`

       - Creates a custom snapshot that includes all operations up to
         but not including the selected time. By default, the
         Oplog Store stores 24 hours of data.

         .. example::

            If you select ``12:00``, the last operation in the restore
            is ``11:59:59`` or earlier.

         .. important::

            You cannot perform a :abbr:`PIT (Point in Time)` restore
            that covers any time prior to the latest backup resync. For
            the conditions that cause a resync, see
            :doc:`/tutorial/resync-backup`.

       - Select a :guilabel:`Date` and :guilabel:`Time`.

     * - :guilabel:`Oplog Timestamp`

       - Creates a custom snapshot based on the timestamp of an
         :manual:`oplog </reference/glossary/#std-term-oplog>` entry (its ``ts`` field). |mms| includes all
         operations up to *and including* the time of the timestamp.

         The oplog entry's ``ts`` field is a
         :manual:`BSON </reference/bson-types>` timestamp and has two
         components: the timestamp and the increment.

       - Type the following:

         :guilabel:`Timestamp`
           The value in seconds since the
           `Unix epoch <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unix_time&oldid=790790482>`_.

         :guilabel:`Increment`
           An incrementing ordinal for operations within a given
           second.

  Click :guilabel:`Next`.
