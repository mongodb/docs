Overview
--------

Atlas App Services automatically generates a GraphQL schema for any collection that has a
defined :ref:`schema <schemas>`. For each collection, App Services generates the
following:

- A :ref:`document type <graphql-document-types>` that represents a single
  document in the collection

- A set of :ref:`queries <graphql-query-resolvers>` and :ref:`mutations
  <graphql-mutation-resolvers>` that allow you to access and manipulate
  documents in the collection.

- A set of :ref:`input types <graphql-input-types>` that allow you to filter
  queries, modify specific fields, and sort results.

.. note:: Example Collection Schema

   This page includes examples that demonstrate generated values based
   on the following schema for a ``movies`` collection:

   .. code-block:: json
      
      {
        "title": "Movie",
        "required": ["title"],
        "properties": {
          "_id": { "bsonType": "objectId" },
          "title": { "bsonType": "string" },
          "year": { "bsonType": "int" },
          "rated": { "bsonType": "string" },
          "runtime": { "bsonType": "int" },
          "director": { "bsonType": "string" },
          "reviews": {
            "bsonType": "array",
            "items": { "bsonType": "objectId" }
          },
          "cast": {
            "bsonType": "array",
            "items": { "bsonType": "string" }
          }
        }
      }

.. _graphql-scalar-types:

Scalar Types
------------

App Services supports all of the standard :graphql:`GraphQL scalar types
<learn/schema/#scalar-types>` and also generates the ``ObjectId`` scalar.

The following scalar types are supported:

- ``ObjectId``: An :manual:`ObjectId </reference/method/ObjectId>` value serialized as a string
- ``Boolean``: ``true`` or ``false``
- ``String``: A UTF‐8 character sequence
- ``Int``: A signed 32‐bit integer
- ``Long``: A signed 64‐bit integer
- ``Float``: A signed double-precision floating-point value
- ``DateTime``: An :rfc:`RFC 3339 <3339>` UTC DateTime (e.g. "2020-09-01T15:38:14.918Z")

.. _graphql-document-types:

Document Types
--------------

App Services generates a single :graphql:`GraphQL type <learn/schema/>` for the
documents in a collection based on the collection schema. The type uses the name
set in the ``title`` field of the schema or the collection name if no ``title``
is specified.

.. code-block:: graphql
   
   type Movie {
     _id: ObjectId
     title: String!
     year: Int
     rated: String
     runtime: Int
     director: String
     cast: [String]
   }

.. _graphql-field-mapping:

Field Mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services attempts to map fields in your collection schema directly to
fields in your GraphQL types. The `definition of valid names
<https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Names>`__ described in the GraphQL spec
does not support all possible valid document field names, so App Services
applies the following transformation rules to determine field names in generated
GraphQL types:

- strip unsupported characters
- strip leading numbers
- convert to camel case
- omit fields that begin with a double underscore (e.g. ``__myField``)

.. _graphql-bson-type-mapping:

BSON Type Mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GraphQL type system is similar but not identical to the BSON types that you
can use in a :ref:`schema <schemas>`. App Services automatically attempts to map
between the BSON types in your schema and supported GraphQL types. If a field
type does not have a GraphQL equivalent, App Services does not include the field in the
generated GraphQL document type.

The following table lists BSON types that you can use in a schema and the
GraphQL types that they map to:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - JSON/BSON Type
     - GraphQL Type
   
   * - ``objectId``
     - ``ObjectId``
   
   * - ``int``
     - ``Int``
   
   * - ``long``
     - ``Int``
   
   * - ``double``
     - ``Float``
   
   * - ``decimal``
     - ``Float``
   
   * - ``date``
     - ``DateTime``
   
   * - ``timestamp``
     - ``DateTime``

.. note:: 
   
   JSON supports two types that represent "no value": ``undefined`` and
   ``null``. The GraphQL spec supports ``null`` but not ``undefined``,
   so your app converts ``undefined`` values in the following way:
   
   - If a document field is explicitly set to ``undefined`` then the
     corresponding GraphQL type is an empty object, i.e. ``{}``.
   
   - If the field name is not defined for the document at all, or if the
     value is explicitly set to ``null``, then the corresponding GraphQL
     type is ``null``.

.. _graphql-input-types:

Input Types
-----------

GraphQL uses :graphql:`input types <learn/schema/#input-types>` to represent
parameters that you pass to queries and mutations. This is a standard approach
used by all GraphQL APIs to define unambiguous, type-safe user inputs.

.. _input-type-query:

QueryInput
~~~~~~~~~~

A ``QueryInput`` object defines a set of one or more conditions that a document
must meet in order to be included in a query. The object may include fields from
the document type as well as any of the *operator fields* that App Services
automatically generates based on each field's type.

- **Document Fields:** If a ``QueryInput`` field has the same name as a field in
  the document type, then App Services matches a document if the value specified in
  the input field and the value of the field in the document are the same.

  .. example::
     
     The following query includes a ``QueryInput`` with two fields, ``rated``
     and ``year``. Both of these field names are defined in the ``Movie`` document
     type, so App Services performs an equality match for both.
     
     The query returns the title of all movies released in the year 2000 that
     are rated R.
     
     .. code-block:: graphql
        
        movies(query: { rated: "R", year: 2000 }) {
          title
        }

- **Operator Fields:** If a ``QueryInput`` field is a valid operator field for the
  queried type, then App Services matches a document if the operator evaluates to
  ``true``.

  .. example::
     
     The following query includes a ``QueryInput`` with two fields, ``rated_in``
     and ``year_gt``. Both of these are operator fields, so App Services evaluates
     each operator to determine if a document matches.
     
     The query returns the title of all movies released after the year 2000 that
     are rated either G or PG-13.
     
     .. code-block:: graphql
        
        movies(query: { rated_in: ["G", "PG-13"], year_gt: 2000 }) {
          title
        }

Comparison Operator Fields
``````````````````````````

A comparison operator field allows you to define a condition that is more
complex than exact equality, such as a range query. App Services generates a set of
comparison operator fields for every field in the document type based on the
field type. Each comparison operator typically applies to only a subset of all
field types, so App Services only generates operator fields for valid combinations.

A comparison operator field evaluates to ``true`` for a given document if the
value of the field in the document satisfies the operator condition relative to
the specified value.

Comparison operator fields have the following form:

.. code-block:: text
   
   <Field Name>_<Operator>: <Operator Value>

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 20 50

   * - Operator
     - Supported Field Types
     - Operator Value Type
     - Description

   * - gt
     - | ``Int``
       | ``Float``
       | ``String``
       | ``ObjectId``
       | ``DateTime``
     - ``<Field Type>``
     - Finds documents where the field is greater than the specified
       value.

       .. example::
          
          This query finds all movies that were released after the year 2000:
          
          .. code-block:: graphql
          
             movies(query: { year_gt: 2000 }) {
               title
               year
             }

   * - gte
     - | ``Int``
       | ``Float``
       | ``String``
       | ``ObjectId``
       | ``DateTime``
     - ``<Field Type>``
     - Finds documents where the field is greater than or equal to the
       specified value.

       .. example::
          
          This query finds all movies that were released in or after the year 2000:
          
          .. code-block:: graphql
          
             movies(query: { year_gte: 2000 }) {
               title
               year
             }

   * - lt
     - | ``Int``
       | ``Float``
       | ``String``
       | ``ObjectId``
       | ``DateTime``
     - ``<Field Type>``
     - Finds documents where the field is less than the specified value.

       .. example::
          
          This query finds all movies that were released before the year 2000:
          
          .. code-block:: graphql
          
             movies(query: { year_lt: 2000 }) {
               title
               year
             }

   * - lte
     - | ``Int``
       | ``Float``
       | ``String``
       | ``ObjectId``
       | ``DateTime``
     - ``<Field Type>``
     - Finds documents where the field is less than or equal to the
       specified value.

       .. example::
          
          This query finds all movies that were released in or before the year 2000:
          
          .. code-block:: graphql
          
             movies(query: { year_lte: 2000 }) {
               title
               year
             }
   
   * - ne
     - | ``Int``
       | ``Float``
       | ``String``
       | ``Boolean``
       | ``ObjectId``
       | ``DateTime``
     - ``<Field Type>``
     - Finds documents where the field is not equal to the specified value.

       .. example::
          
          This query finds all movies that were released in any year other than 2000:
          
          .. code-block:: graphql
          
             movies(query: { year_ne: 2000 }) {
               title
               year
             }
   
   * - in
     - | ``Int``
       | ``Float``
       | ``String``
       | ``Boolean``
       | ``ObjectId``
       | ``DateTime``
       | ``Array``
     - ``[<Field Type>]``
     - Finds documents where the field is equal to any value in the specified
       array. If the field is an ``Array``, this finds all documents where
       any value in the field array is also included in the specified array.

       .. example::
          
          This query finds all movies that feature either or both of Emma Stone
          and Ryan Gosling:
          
          .. code-block:: graphql
          
             movies(query: { cast_in: ["Emma Stone", "Ryan Gosling"] }) {
               title
               year
             }
   
   * - nin
     - | ``Int``
       | ``Float``
       | ``String``
       | ``Boolean``
       | ``ObjectId``
       | ``DateTime``
       | ``Array``
     - ``[<Field Type>]``
     - Finds documents where the field is not equal to any value in the
       specified array. If the field is an ``Array``, this finds all documents
       where any value in the field array is also in the specified
       array.

       .. example::
          
          This query finds all movies that are not rated either G or PG-13:
          
          .. code-block:: graphql
          
             movies(query: { rated_nin: ["G", "PG-13"] }) {
               title
               year
             }

Logical Operator Fields
```````````````````````

A logical operator field allows you to define logical combinations of
independent ``QueryInput`` objects. App Services generates root-level logical operator
fields for all ``QueryInput`` types.

A logical operator field evaluates to ``true`` for a given document if the
evaluated result of all specified ``QueryInput`` objects satisfy the operator
condition.

Logical operator fields have the following form:

.. code-block:: text
   
   <Operator>: [<QueryInput>, ...]

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 30

   * - Operator
     - Operator Value Type
     - Description

   * - AND
     - ``[QueryInput!]``
     - Finds documents that match *all* of the provided ``QueryInput`` objects.
       
       .. example::
          
          This query finds all movies that are rated PG-13 *and* have a runtime
          of less than 120 minutes:
          
          .. code-block:: graphql
          
             query {
               movies(query: { AND: [{ rated: "PG-13" }, { runtime_lt: 120 }] }) {
                 title
                 year
               }
             }

   * - OR
     - ``[QueryInput!]``
     - Finds documents that match *any* of the provided ``QueryInput`` objects.
       
       .. example::
          
          This query finds all movies that are rated either G or PG-13:
          
          .. code-block:: graphql
          
             query {
               movies(query: { OR: [{ rated: "G" }, { rated: "PG-13" }] }) {
                 title
                 year
               }
             }

Element Operator Fields
```````````````````````

An element operator field allows you to define a boolean condition that
describes a field in the document. App Services generates a set of element operator
fields for every field in the document type.

An element operator field evaluates to ``true`` for a given document if the
result of evaluating the operator condition on the field in the document matches
the specified boolean value.

Element operator fields have the following form:

.. code-block:: text
   
   <Field Name>_<Operator>: <Operator Value>

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 20 20 50

   * - Operator
     - Supported Types
     - Operator Value Type
     - Description

   * - exists
     - Available for all types
     - Boolean
     - Finds documents where the field is not ``null``.
       
       .. example::
          
          This query finds all movies that do not have a value defined for the
          ``year`` field:
          
          .. code-block:: graphql
          
             query {
               movies(query: { year_exists: false }) {
                 _id
                 title
               }
             }

.. _input-type-insert:

InsertInput
~~~~~~~~~~~

An ``InsertInput`` object defines a document to insert into a collection. The
document must conform to the GraphQL document type and include all required
fields.

.. example::
   
   The following mutation includes an ``InsertInput`` with several fields that
   are all defined in the ``Movie`` document type. The ``Movie`` type requires
   all documents to have a ``title`` field, so the ``InsertInput`` must include
   one.
   
   The mutation inserts a new movie named "My Fake Film".
   
   .. code-block:: graphql
      
      insertOneMovie(input: {
        title: "My Fake Film",
        rated: "UNRATED",
        year: 2020
      }) {
        title
      }

.. _input-type-update:

UpdateInput
~~~~~~~~~~~

An ``UpdateInput`` object defines a new value for one or more fields in a
document. The updated document includes the new field values. Any fields that
you do not specify remain unchanged. The updated values must conform to the
GraphQL document type.

.. example::
   
   The following mutation includes an ``UpdateInput`` that sets the ``title``
   field to "My Super Real Film".
   
   .. code-block:: graphql
      
      updateOneMovie(
        query: { title: "My Fake Film" }
        set: { title: "My Super Real Film" }
      ) {
        title
      }

RelationInput
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``RelationInput`` defines a new set of related documents for a relationship
field in the mutated document. You can reference documents that already exist in
the related collection with the ``link`` field or insert new documents into the
related collection with the ``create`` field.

You cannot use both ``link`` and ``create`` at the same time. If both
are specified, the ``create`` operation takes precedence and the
``link`` is ignored.

.. code-block:: graphql
   
   type RelationInput {
     link: [ObjectId]
     create: [InsertInput]
   }

.. example::
   
   The following mutation includes an ``UpdateInput`` that modifies the
   ``reviews`` field. The field contains an array of ``_id`` values for
   documents in a separate ``reviews`` collection for to the field has a defined
   relationship.
   
   The mutation sets the relationship to point to one newly created document and
   two existing documents in the ``reviews`` collection.
   
   .. code-block:: graphql
      
      updateOneMovie(
        query: { title: "My Fake Film" }
        set: {
          reviews: {
            link: ["", ""]
            create: []
          }
        }
      ) {
        title
      }


.. _input-type-sortby:

SortByInput
~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``SortByInput`` enum defines a sort order for documents returned by a query.
You can sort in ascending and descending order by any root-level field that does
not have a type of ``object`` or ``array``. The GraphQL API does not support
nested sorts.

App Services generates two sort enum values for each field. Each value is a
fully-capitalized identifier that combines the field name and the sort
direction, either ``ASC`` or ``DESC``.

.. example::
   
   The following query returns movies sorted by the year they were released with
   the most recent movies listed first.
   
   .. code-block:: graphql
      
      movies(sortBy: YEAR_DESC) {
        title
      }

.. _graphql-query-resolvers:

Query Resolvers
---------------

App Services generates two :ref:`GraphQL queries <graphql-query-resolvers>`
for each collection:

- A **singular** query that finds a specific document in the collection.

- A **plural** query that finds all documents in the collection. You can
  filter a plural query to include only the subset of documents in a
  collection that match a ``QueryInput``.

.. _graphql-findOne:

Find a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The single document query field uses the same name as the data type
that the collection contains. It returns a single document of the
queried type and accepts the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60
   
   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   
   * - ``query``
     - :ref:`QueryInput <input-type-query>`
     - Optional. An object that defines a filter for documents in the
       collection. The object may specify one or more fields from the
       data type and must include a value for each field. The query
       matches all documents that include the specified field values.

       If you do not specify a ``query`` parameter then the query
       operation matches all documents.

.. code-block:: graphql
   
   query {
     movie(query: { title: "The Matrix" }) {
       title
       year
       runtime
       director
     }
   }

.. _graphql-findMany:

Find Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The multiple document query field uses the same name as the data type
that the collection contains but has an additional ``"s"`` appended to
the type name. It returns an array of documents of the queried type and
accepts the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60
   
   * - Parameter
     - GraphQL Type
     - Description
   
   * - ``query``
     - :ref:`QueryInput <input-type-query>`
     - Optional. An object that defines a filter for documents in the
       collection. The object may specify one or more fields from the
       data type and must include a value for each field. The query
       matches all documents that include the specified field values.

       If you do not specify a ``query`` argument then the query
       operation matches all documents.
   
   * - ``limit``
     - Int
     - Optional. Default ``100``. The maximum number of documents to
       include in the query result set. If the query matches more than
       the set limit then it only returns a subset of matched documents.
   
   * - ``sortBy``
     - :ref:`SortByInput <input-type-sortby>`
     - Optional. A value that defines a sort order for documents in the
       query result set. You can sort in ascending and descending order
       by any root-level field that does not have a type of ``object``
       or ``array``.

       The ``sortBy`` value is a fully-capitalized identifier that
       combines the field name and the sort direction. For example:
       
       - to sort by title from A to Z you would use ``TITLE_ASC``
       - to sort by rating from highest to lowest you would use ``RATING_DESC``

       If you do not specify a ``sortBy`` argument then the query
       operation does not guarantee the order of documents in the result
       set.

.. code-block:: graphql
   
   query {
     movies(
       query: { year: 2000 }
       limit: 100

.. _graphql-mutation-resolvers:

Mutation Resolvers
------------------

App Services generates a set of mutations for the documents in each
collection. These allow you insert, modify, and delete one or more
documents.

.. _graphql-insertOne:

Insert a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The single document insert mutation field uses the name
``insertOne<Type>`` where ``<Type>`` is the singular name of the data
type that the collection contains. It returns the inserted document and
accepts the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60
   
   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   
   * - ``data``
     - :ref:`InsertInput! <input-type-insert>`
     - Required. A document to insert into the collection. If the
       collection schema marks a field as required then this document
       must include a valid value for that field. App Services automatically
       converts GraphQL types in the ``InsertInput`` object into their
       respective BSON type.

.. code-block:: graphql
   
   mutation {
     insertOneMovie(data: {
       title: "Little Women"
       director: "Greta Gerwig"
       year: 2019
       runtime: 135
     }) {
       _id
       title
     }
   }

.. _graphql-insertMany:

Insert Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The multiple document insert mutation field uses the name
``insertMany<Type>s`` where ``<Type>`` is the singular name of the data
type that the collection contains. It returns the inserted document and
accepts the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60
   
   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   
   * - ``data``
     - [:ref:`InsertInput! <input-type-insert>`]!
     - Required. An array of documents to insert into the collection.
       The array must contain at least one document. If the collection
       schema marks a field as required then each document must include
       a valid value for that field. App Services automatically converts
       GraphQL types in the ``InsertInput`` object into their respective
       BSON type as defined in the collection schema.

.. code-block:: graphql
   
   mutation {
     insertManyMovies(data: [
       {
         title: "Little Women"
         director: "Greta Gerwig"
         year: 2019
         runtime: 135
       },
       {
         title: "1917"
         director: "Sam Mendes"
         year: 2019
         runtime: 119
       }
     ]) {
       _id
       title
     }
   }

.. _graphql-updateOne:

Update a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The single document update mutation field uses the name
``updateOne<Type>`` where ``<Type>`` is the singular name of the data
type that the collection contains. It returns the updated document and
accepts the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60
   
   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   
   * - ``query``
     - :ref:`QueryInput <input-type-query>`
     - Optional. An object that configures which documents in the
       collection to update. The object may specify one or more fields
       from the data type and must include a value for each field. The
       query matches all documents that include the specified field
       values.
       
       If you do not specify a ``query`` argument then the mutation
       updates the first document in the result set, which is likely but
       not guaranteed to be the most recently inserted document.
   
   * - ``set``
     - UpdateInput!
     - Required. An object that defines a new value for one or more
       fields in the document. The updated document will include the new
       field values. Any fields that you do not specify remain
       unchanged. App Services automatically converts GraphQL types in the
       ``UpdateInput`` object into their respective BSON type.

.. code-block:: graphql
   
   mutation {
     updateOneMovie(
       query: { title: "The Room" }
       set: { runtime: 99 }
     ) {
       _id
       title
     }
   }

.. _graphql-updateMany:

Update Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The multiple document update mutation field uses the name
``updateMany<Type>s`` where ``<Type>`` is the singular name of the data
type that the collection contains. It returns an ``UpdateManyPayload``
document that describes the number of fields that were matched and
modified and accepts the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60
   
   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   
   * - ``query``
     - :ref:`QueryInput <input-type-query>`
     - Optional. An object that configures which documents in the
       collection to update. The object may specify one or more fields
       from the data type and must include a value for each field. The
       query matches all documents that include the specified field
       values.

       If you do not specify a ``query`` argument then the mutation
       updates the first document in the result set, which is likely but
       not guaranteed to be the most recently inserted document.
   
   * - ``set``
     - :ref:`UpdateInput! <input-type-update>`
     - Required. An object that defines a new value for one or more
       fields in the document. The updated document will include the new
       field values. Any fields that you do not specify remain
       unchanged. App Services automatically converts GraphQL types in the
       ``UpdateInput`` object into their respective BSON type.

.. code-block:: graphql
   
   mutation {
     updateManyMovies(
       query: { director: "Tommy Wiseau" }
       set: { director: "Tom Wiseau" }
     ) {
       matchedCount
       modifiedCount
     }
   }

.. _graphql-upsertOne:

Upsert a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The single document upsert mutation field uses the name
``upsertOne<Type>`` where ``<Type>`` is the singular name of the data
type that the collection contains. This resolver updates a document that
matches the query parameter and inserts a new document if none match the
query. It returns the upserted document and accepts the following
parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60
   
   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   
   * - ``query``
     - :ref:`QueryInput <input-type-query>`
     - Optional. An object that configures which document to update. The
       object may specify one or more fields from the data type and must
       include a value for each field. The query matches all documents
       that include the specified field values.

       If you do not specify a ``query`` argument or no documents match,
       then the mutation inserts the document specified in the ``data``
       parameter.
   
   * - ``data``
     - :ref:`InsertInput! <input-type-insert>`
     - Required. The document to insert if the ``query`` does not match
       any existing documents. If the ``query`` does match a document
       replaces the queried document. If the collection schema marks a
       field as required then this document must include a valid value
       for that field. App Services automatically converts GraphQL types in
       the ``InsertInput`` object into their respective BSON type.

.. code-block:: graphql
   
   mutation {
     upsertOneMovie(
       query: { title: "Blacksmith Scene" }
       data: {
         title: "Sandcastles in the Sand",
         director: "Robin Scherbatsky"
         runtime: 90
         year: 2002
       }
     ) {
       _id
       title
     }
   }

.. _graphql-replaceOne:

Replace a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The single document replacement mutation field uses the name
``replaceOne<Type>`` where ``<Type>`` is the singular name of the data
type that the collection contains. It returns the replaced document and
accepts the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60
   
   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   
   * - ``query``
     - :ref:`QueryInput <input-type-query>`
     - Optional. An object that configures which documents in the
       collection to replace. The object may specify one or more fields
       from the data type and must include a value for each field. The
       query matches all documents that include the specified field
       values.

       If you do not specify a ``query`` argument then the mutation
       replaces the first document in the result set, which is likely
       but not guaranteed to be the most recently inserted document.
   
   * - ``data``
     - :ref:`InsertInput! <input-type-insert>`
     - Required. The document that replaces the queried document. If the
       collection schema marks a field as required then this document
       must include a valid value for that field. App Services automatically
       converts GraphQL types in the ``InsertInput`` object into their
       respective BSON type.

.. code-block:: graphql
   
   mutation {
     replaceOneMovie(
       query: { title: "Blacksmith Scene" }
       data: {
         title: "Sandcastles in the Sand",
         director: "Robin Scherbatsky"
         runtime: 90
         year: 2002
       }
     ) {
       _id
       title
     }
   }

.. _graphql-deleteOne:

Delete a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The single document delete mutation field uses the name
``deleteOne<Type>`` where ``<Type>`` is the singular name of the data
type that the collection contains. It returns the deleted document and
accepts the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60
   
   * - Parameter
     - Type
     - Description
   
   * - ``query``
     - :ref:`QueryInput <input-type-query>`
     - Required. An object that configures which document in the
       collection to delete. The object may specify one or more fields
       from the data type and must include a value for each field. The
       query matches all documents that include the specified field
       values.

       If the ``query`` matches multiple documents, the mutation deletes
       the first document in the result set, which is likely but not
       guaranteed to be the most recently inserted document.

.. code-block:: graphql
   
   mutation {
     deleteOneMovie(query: { title: "The Room" }) {
       _id
       title
       year
       runtime
       director
     }
   }

.. _graphql-deleteMany:

Delete Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The multiple document delete mutation field uses the name
``deleteMany<Type>s`` where ``<Type>`` is the singular name of the data
type that the collection contains. It returns a ``DeleteManyPayload``
document that describes the number of documents that were deleted and
accepts the following parameters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60
   
   * - Parameter

   * - ``query``
     - :ref:`QueryInput <input-type-query>`
     - Optional. An object that configures which documents in the
       collection to delete. The object may specify one or more fields
       from the data type and must include a value for each field. The
       query matches all documents that include the specified field
       values.

       If you do not specify a ``query`` argument then the mutation
       deletes all documents in the collection.

.. code-block:: graphql
   
   mutation {
     deleteManyMovies(query: { director: "Tommy Wiseau" }) {
       deletedCount
     }
   }

.. _graphql-paginate:

Paginate Data
-------------

You can paginate data in your queries with the types provided by the GraphQL API's
generated schema.

The Atlas GraphQL API **does not** have an ``offset`` operator, like the
:graphql:`GraphQL documentation recommends for pagination <learn/pagination/#pagination-and-edges>`.

Instead you can use the generated schema's :ref:`find multiple documents query resolvers
<graphql-findMany>`
with ``query``, ``limit``, and ``sortBy`` operators to paginate data.

To paginate data in **ascending** order:

.. code-block:: graphql

   query PaginateAscending(
     # Do not include `previousTitle` for the first query
     # in a pagination sequence.
     $previousTitle: String,
     $limit: Int!,
   ) {
     movies(
       query: { title_gt: $previousTitle  }
       limit: $limit
       sortBy: TITLE_ASC
     ) {
       title
       year
       runtime
       director
     }
   }

To paginate data in **descending** order:

.. code-block:: graphql

   query PaginateAscending(
     # Do not include `nextTitle` for the first query
     # in a pagination sequence.
     $nextTitle: String,
     $limit: Int!,
   ) {
     movies(
       query: { title_lt: $nextTitle  }
       limit: $limit
       sortBy: TITLE_DESC
     ) {
       title
       year
       runtime
       director
     }
   }

For a example of this pagination pattern implemented in a client application,
refer to :ref:`Paginate Data <graphql-apollo-paginate>` in the Realm Web SDK documentation.

.. note::

   This approach to pagination is similar to range queries for MongoDB drivers,
   as described in the :manual:`MongoDB Server documentation
   </reference/method/cursor.skip/#using-range-queries>`.
