MongoDB supports query operations on geospatial data. This section
introduces MongoDB's geospatial features. 

.. |page-topic| replace:: run geospatial queries

Compatibility
-------------

.. |operator-method| replace:: geospatial queries

.. include:: /includes/fact-compatibility.rst

For deployments hosted in {+atlas+}, you can run geospatial 
queries in the UI by using the query :guilabel:`Filter` bar or aggregation 
builder. To learn more, see :ref:`geospatial-queries-atlas`.

.. _geo-overview-location-data:

Geospatial Data
---------------

In MongoDB, you can store geospatial data as :ref:`GeoJSON
<geospatial-geojson>` objects or as :ref:`legacy coordinate pairs
<geospatial-legacy>`.

.. _geospatial-geojson:

GeoJSON Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To calculate geometry over an Earth-like sphere, store your location
data as :ref:`GeoJSON objects <geospatial-indexes-store-geojson>`.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/geojson-specification-geospatial.rst

.. _geospatial-legacy:

Legacy Coordinate Pairs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To calculate distances on a Euclidean plane, store your location data
as legacy coordinate pairs and use a :ref:`geo-2d` index. MongoDB
supports spherical surface calculations on legacy coordinate pairs by using
a :ref:`geo-2dsphere` index if you manually convert the data to 
the :ref:`GeoJSON Point type <geojson-point>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-legacy-coordinates-specification.rst

.. _index-feature-geospatial:

Geospatial Indexes
------------------

MongoDB provides the following geospatial index types to support
geospatial queries. For more information on geospatial indexes, see
:ref:`geospatial-index`.

.. _geo-2dsphere:

``2dsphere``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`2dsphere <2dsphere-index>` indexes support queries that calculate
:ref:`geometries on an earth-like sphere <geospatial-geometry>`.

.. include:: /includes/create-2dsphere-index.rst

For more information on the ``2dsphere`` index, see
:ref:`<2dsphere-index>`.

.. _geo-2d:

``2d``
~~~~~~

:ref:`2d <2d-index>` indexes support queries that calculate
:ref:`geometries on a two-dimensional plane <geospatial-geometry>`.
Although the index can support :query:`$nearSphere` queries that
calculate on a sphere, if possible, use the :ref:`geo-2dsphere` index
for spherical queries.

.. include:: /includes/create-2d-index.rst

For more information on the ``2d`` index, see :ref:`<2d-index>`.

Geospatial Queries

.. _geospatial-operators:

Geospatial Query Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides the following geospatial query operators:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30,70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name

     - Description

   * - :query:`$geoIntersects`

     - Selects geometries that intersect with a :term:`GeoJSON` geometry.
       The ``2dsphere`` index supports :query:`$geoIntersects`.
   

   * - :query:`$geoWithin`

     - Selects geometries within a bounding :ref:`GeoJSON geometry
       <geospatial-indexes-store-geojson>`. The ``2dsphere`` and 
       ``2d`` indexes support :query:`$geoWithin`.
   

   * - :query:`$near`

     - Returns geospatial objects in proximity to a point.
       Requires a geospatial index.  The ``2dsphere`` and ``2d`` indexes 
       support :query:`$near`.
   

   * - :query:`$nearSphere`

     - Returns geospatial objects in proximity to a point on a sphere.
       Requires a geospatial index.  The ``2dsphere`` and ``2d`` indexes 
       support :query:`$nearSphere`.
   


For more details, including examples, see the individual reference page.

.. _geospatial-aggregation:

Geospatial Aggregation Stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB provides the following geospatial :ref:`aggregation pipeline
stage <aggregation-pipeline>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 38 72

   * - Stage

     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$geoNear`

     - .. include:: /includes/extracts/geoNear-stage-toc-description.rst

       .. include:: /includes/extracts/geoNear-stage-index-requirement.rst

For more details, including examples, see :pipeline:`$geoNear`
reference page.

.. _geospatial-geometry:

Geospatial Models
-----------------

MongoDB geospatial queries can interpret geometry on a flat surface or
a sphere.

``2dsphere`` indexes support only spherical queries (i.e. queries that
interpret geometries on a spherical surface).

``2d`` indexes support flat queries (i.e. queries that interpret
geometries on a flat surface) and some spherical queries. While ``2d``
indexes support some spherical queries, the use of ``2d`` indexes for
these spherical queries can result in error. If possible, use
``2dsphere`` indexes for spherical queries.

The following table lists the geospatial query operators, supported
query, used by each geospatial operations:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 48, 12, 40

   * - Operation

     - Spherical/Flat Query

     - Notes

   * - :query:`$near` (:ref:`GeoJSON <geospatial-geojson>` centroid
       point in this line and the following line, :ref:`2dsphere
       <geo-2dsphere>` index)

     - Spherical

     - See also the :query:`$nearSphere` operator, which provides the
       same functionality when used with :ref:`GeoJSON
       <geospatial-geojson>` and a :ref:`2dsphere <geo-2dsphere>` index.

   * - :query:`$near` (:ref:`legacy coordinates <geospatial-legacy>`, :ref:`2d <geo-2d>` index)

     - Flat

     -

   * - :query:`$nearSphere` (:ref:`GeoJSON <geospatial-geojson>` point, :ref:`2dsphere <geo-2dsphere>` index)

     - Spherical

     - Provides the same functionality as :query:`$near` operation that
       uses :ref:`GeoJSON <geospatial-geojson>` point and a
       :ref:`2dsphere <geo-2dsphere>` index.

       For spherical queries, it may be preferable to use
       :query:`$nearSphere` which explicitly specifies the spherical
       queries in the name rather than :query:`$near` operator.

   * - :query:`$nearSphere` (:ref:`legacy coordinates <geospatial-legacy>`, :ref:`2d <geo-2d>` index)

     - Spherical

     - Use :term:`GeoJSON` points instead.

   * - :query:`$geoWithin` : { :query:`$geometry`: ... }

     - Spherical

     -

   * - :query:`$geoWithin` : { :query:`$box`: ... }

     - Flat

     -

   * - :query:`$geoWithin` : { :query:`$polygon`: ... }

     - Flat

     -

   * - :query:`$geoWithin` : { :query:`$center`: ... }

     - Flat

     -

   * - :query:`$geoWithin` : { :query:`$centerSphere`: ... }

     - Spherical

     -

   * - :query:`$geoIntersects`

     - Spherical

     -


   * - :pipeline:`$geoNear` aggregation stage (:ref:`2dsphere <geo-2dsphere>` index)
     - Spherical
     -

   * - :pipeline:`$geoNear` aggregation stage (:ref:`2d <geo-2d>` index)

Perform Geospatial Queries in Atlas
-----------------------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Query Filter Bar
      :tabid: filter-bar

      You can use the {+atlas+} UI
      to perform geospatial queries in Atlas. 

      .. procedure::
        :style: normal

        .. step:: Create an index

           If your geospatial collection does not already have a geospatial
           index, you must create one.

           1. Select the database for the collection.

              The main panel and :guilabel:`Namespaces` on the left side 
              list the collections in the database.
          
           #. Select the collection.

              Select the collection that contains your geospatial data on 
              the left-hand side or in the main panel. The main panel displays 
              the :guilabel:`Find`, :guilabel:`Indexes`, and 
              :guilabel:`Aggregation` views.

           #. Select the Index view.
                
              When you open the :guilabel:`Index` view, Atlas
              displays any indexes that exist on the collection.

           #. Define the Index for the geo Type

              Press the :guilabel:`Create Index` button. 

              Define a geo Type index. Refer to 
              `How to Index GeoJSON Objects <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/field-types/geo-type/>`__.

        .. step:: Query the geospatial data 

           1. Select the Find view.

              From the collection that contains your geospatial
              data, select the :guilabel:`Find` tab to view your geospatial 
              collection.

           #. Enter a query.

              Enter a query in the :guilabel:`Filter` text box. Use
              any of the :ref:`geospatial query operators 
              <geospatial-operators>` to perform the relevant query
              on your geospatial data. A geospatial query might resemble:

              .. code-block:: javascript

                  { 
                    "coordinates": { 
                      $geoWithin: { 
                        $geometry: { 
                          type: "Polygon", 
                          coordinates: [ 
                            [ 
                              [-80.0, 10.00], [ -80.0, 9.00], [ -79.0, 9.0], [ -79.0, 10.00 ], [ -80.0, 10.0 ] 
                            ] 
                          ] 
                        } 
                      } 
                    } 
                  }

           #. Press the Apply button.

              Press the :guilabel:`Apply` button to apply your query.
              Atlas filters the geospatial data to show only documents
              that match your geospatial query.

   .. tab:: Aggregation
      :tabid: aggregation

      You can create and execute aggregation pipelines to perform geospatial
      queries in the {+atlas+} UI.

      .. procedure::
        :style: normal

        .. step:: Access the aggregation pipeline builder

           1. Select the database for the collection.

              The main panel and :guilabel:`Namespaces` on the left side list the
              collections in the database.

           #. Select the collection.

              Select the collection that contains your geospatial data on 
              the left-hand side or in the main panel. The main panel displays 
              the :guilabel:`Find`, :guilabel:`Indexes`, and 
              :guilabel:`Aggregation` views.

           #. Select the Aggregation view.
                
              When you first open the :guilabel:`Aggregation` view, Atlas
              displays an empty aggregation pipeline.

        .. step:: Create your geospatial query aggregation pipeline

           1. Select an aggregation stage.

              Select an aggregation stage from the :guilabel:`Select` dropdown in
              the bottom-left panel.

              The toggle to the right of the dropdown dictates whether the
              stage is enabled.

              Use the :pipeline:`$geoNear` stage to perform geospatial
              queries in your aggregation pipeline.

           #. Fill in your aggregation stage.

              Fill in your stage with the appropriate values. 
              If :ref:`Comment Mode <pipeline-settings>` is enabled, the pipeline
              builder provides syntactic guidelines for your selected stage. 

              As you modify your stage, Atlas updates the preview documents on
              the right based on the results of the current stage.

              Your :pipeline:`$geoNear` stage may resemble:

              .. code-block:: javascript

                  {
                    near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.9667, 40.78 ] },
                    spherical: true,
                    query: { category: "Parks" },
                    distanceField: "calcDistance"
                  }

           #. Run other pipeline stages as needed.

              Add stages as needed to complete your aggregation pipeline. 
              You might add :pipeline:`$out` or 
              :pipeline:`$merge` to write the results to a 
              view or the current collection.

.. _geospatial-query-examples:

Examples
--------

.. include:: /includes/geospatial-places-data-setup.rst

The ``places`` collection above has a ``2dsphere`` index.
The following query uses the :query:`$near` operator to return
documents that are at least 1000 meters from and at most 5000 meters
from the specified GeoJSON point, sorted in order from nearest to
farthest:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find(
      {
        location:
          { $near:
             {
               $geometry: { type: "Point",  coordinates: [ -73.9667, 40.78 ] },
               $minDistance: 1000,
               $maxDistance: 5000
             }
          }
      }
   )

The following operation uses the :pipeline:`$geoNear` aggregation
operation to return documents that match the query filter ``{ category:
"Parks" }``, sorted in order of nearest to farthest to the specified
GeoJSON point:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.aggregate( [
      {
         $geoNear: {
            near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.9667, 40.78 ] },
            spherical: true,
            query: { category: "Parks" },
            distanceField: "calcDistance"
         }
      }
   ] )
