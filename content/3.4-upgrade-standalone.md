# Upgrade a Standalone to 3.4

Package Updates required on Ubuntu 16.04 for IBM POWER Systems: Due to a lock elision bug present in older versions of the ``glibc``
package on Ubuntu 16.04 for POWER, you must upgrade the ``glibc``
package to at least ``glibc 2.23-0ubuntu5`` before running MongoDB.
Systems with older versions of the ``glibc`` package will experience
database server crashes and misbehavior due to random memory
corruption, and are unsuitable for production deployments of MongoDB

Important: Before you attempt any upgrade, please familiarize yourself with the content of this document.

If you need guidance on upgrading to 3.4, [MongoDB offers major version
upgrade services](https://www.mongodb.com/products/consulting?jmp=docs) to help ensure
a smooth transition without interruption to your MongoDB application.


## Upgrade Recommendations and Checklists

When upgrading, consider the following:


### Upgrade Version Path

To upgrade an existing MongoDB deployment to 3.4, you must be running a
3.2-series release.

To upgrade from a version earlier than the 3.2-series, you must
successively upgrade major releases until you have upgraded to
3.2-series. For example, if you are running a 3.0-series, you must
upgrade first to [3.2](../3.2-upgrade/) *before* you can upgrade to 3.4.


### Preparedness

Before beginning your upgrade, see the [Compatibility Changes in MongoDB 3.4](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4-compatibility) document to
ensure that your applications and deployments are compatible with
MongoDB 3.4. Resolve the incompatibilities in your deployment before
starting the upgrade.

Before upgrading MongoDB, always test your application in a staging
environment before deploying the upgrade to your production
environment.


### Downgrade Consideration

Once upgraded to 3.4, you cannot downgrade to a 3.2.7 or earlier
version. You can only downgrade to a 3.2.8 or later version.

The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a standalone
[``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) from version 3.2 to 3.4.


## Download 3.4 Binaries


### Via Package Manager

If you installed MongoDB from the MongoDB ``apt``, ``yum``, ``dnf``, or
``zypper`` repositories, you should upgrade to 3.4 using your package
manager.

Follow the appropriate [installation instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux) for your Linux system. This will
involve adding a repository for the new release, then performing the
actual upgrade process.


### Manually

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the [MongoDB Download
Center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs).

See [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation) for more information.


## Upgrade Process


### Step 1: Replace existing 3.2 binaries with the 3.4 binaries.

Shut down your [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance. Replace the existing
binary with the 3.4 [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary and restart
[``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod).


### Step 2: Enable backwards-incompatible 3.4 features.

At this point, you can run the 3.4 binaries without the
3.4 [features that are incompatible](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4-compatibility/#compatibility-enabled) with 3.2.

To enable these 3.4 features, set the feature compatibility
version to 3.4.

Warning: Enabling these backwards-incompatible features can [complicate the downgrade process](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4-downgrade/#downgrade-features-prereq). For details, see [Remove 3.4 Incompatible Features](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4-downgrade/#downgrade-features-prereq).It is recommended that after upgrading, you allow your deployment to run without enabling these features for a burn-in period to ensure the likelihood of downgrade is minimal. When you are confident that the likelihood of downgrade is minimal, enable these features.

Run the ``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`` command against the ``admin`` database:

```javascript

db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4" } )

```

This command must perform writes to an internal system
collection. If for any reason the command does not complete
successfully, you can safely retry the command as
the operation is idempotent.
