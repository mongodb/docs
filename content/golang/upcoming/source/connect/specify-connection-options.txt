Overview
--------

This guide explains several common MongoDB connection and authentication
options. You can pass the connection options as parameters in the connection
URI to specify the behavior of the client.

Options
-------

The following table describes the connection options that you can set in
your connection URI. Each entry provides the option name, value type,
default value, and a description of the option.

   * - Option Name
     - Type
     - Default Value
     - Description

   * - **timeoutMS**
     - integer
     - ``null``
     - Specifies the number of milliseconds that a single operation run on the
       ``Client`` can take before returning a timeout error. Operations honor
       this setting only if there is no deadline on the operation
       Context. To learn more about this option, see the :ref:`CSOT
       <golang-csot>` guide.

   * - **connectTimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - ``30000``
     - Specifies the time in milliseconds to attempt a connection before
       timing out.

   * - **maxPoolSize**
     - integer
     - ``100``
     - Specifies the maximum number of connections that a connection pool may
       have at a given time.

   * - **replicaSet**
     - string
     - ``null``
     - Specifies the replica set name for the cluster. All nodes in the
       replica set must have the same replica set name, or the Client will not
       consider them as part of the set.

   * - **maxIdleTimeMS**
     - integer
     - ``0``
     - Specifies the maximum amount of time a connection can remain idle
       in the connection pool before being removed and closed. The
       default is ``0``, meaning a connection can remain unused
       indefinitely.

   * - **minPoolSize**
     - integer
     - ``0``
     - Specifies the minimum number of connections that the driver maintains
       in a single connection pool.

   * - **serverSelectionTimeoutMS**
     - integer
     - ``30000``
     - Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait to find an available,
       suitable server to execute an operation.

   * - **heartbeatFrequencyMS**
     - integer
     - ``10000``
     - Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait between periodic
       background server checks.

   * - **tls**
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether to establish a Transport Layer Security (TLS)
       connection with the instance. This is automatically set to ``true``
       when using a DNS seedlist (SRV) in the connection string. You can
       override this behavior by setting the value to ``false``.

   * - **w**
     - string or integer
     - ``null``
     - Specifies the write concern. To learn more about values, see the
       server documentation on
       :manual:`Write Concern options </reference/write-concern>`.

   * - **directConnection**
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether to force dispatch **all** operations to the host
       specified in the connection URI.

For a full list of connection options, see the `ClientOptions API
documentation
<{+api+}/mongo/options#ClientOptions>`__.
