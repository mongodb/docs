Definition
----------

.. group:: $maxN

   .. versionadded:: 5.2

   Returns an aggregation of the maxmimum value ``n`` elements within a 
   group. If the group contains fewer than ``n`` elements, ``$maxN`` 
   returns all elements in the group.

Syntax
------

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   {
      $maxN:
         {
            input: <expression>,
            n: <expression>
         }
   }

- ``input`` specifies an expression that is the input to ``$maxN``. It 
  is evaluated for each element in the group and ``$maxN`` preserves the 
  maximum ``n`` values.
- ``n`` limits the number of results per group and ``n`` has to be a
  positive integral expression that is either a constant or depends on 
  the ``_id`` value for :pipeline:`$group`.

Null and Missing Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``$maxN`` filters out null and missing values.

Consider the following aggregation that returns the maximum ``n`` 
documents from a group:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 7,8

   db.aggregate( [
      {
         $documents: [
            { playerId: "PlayerA", gameId: "G1", score: 1 },
            { playerId: "PlayerB", gameId: "G1", score: 2 },
            { playerId: "PlayerC", gameId: "G1", score: 3 },
            { playerId: "PlayerD", gameId: "G1" },
            { playerId: "PlayerE", gameId: "G1", score: null }
         ]
      },
      {
         $group:
         {  
            _id: "$gameId",
            maximumThreeScores:
               { 
                  $maxN:
                     {    
                        input: "$score",
                        n: 4
                     }
               }
         }
      }
   ] )

In this example:

- :pipeline:`$documents` creates the literal documents that contain
  player scores.
- :pipeline:`$group` groups the documents by ``gameId``. This
  example has only one ``gameId``, ``G1``.
- ``PlayerD`` has a missing score and ``PlayerE`` has a
  null ``score``. These values are both considered as null.
- The ``maximumThreeScores`` field is specified as :group:`$maxN` 
  with ``input : "$score"`` and returned as an array.
- Since there are only 3 documents with ``scores`` ``maxN`` returns the
  maximum 3  ``score`` fields even though ``n = 4``.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [ 
      { 
      _id: 'G1',
      maximumThreeScores: [ 3, 2, 1 ] 
      } 
   ]

Comparison of ``$maxN`` and ``$topN`` Accumulators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both :group:`$maxN` and :group:`$topN` accumulators can accomplish similar 
results.

In general:

- :group:`$maxN` has the advantage of finding maximum values 
  in no particular sort order. If you want to know the 
  maximum values for ``n`` documents use :group:`$maxN`.

- If guaranteing a particular sort order is a requirement 
  use :group:`$topN`. 

- Use :group:`$topN` if you don't intend on sorting on the output 
  values.

Restrictions
------------

Window Function and Aggregation Expression Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use :group:`$maxN` as an accumulator.

:group:`$maxN` is supported as an
:ref:`aggregation expression <aggregation-expressions>`.

:group:`$maxN` is supported as a 
:pipeline:`window operator <$setWindowFields>`.

Memory Limit Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aggregation pipelines which call ``$maxN`` are subject to the
:ref:`100 MB limit <agg-memory-restrictions>`. If this
limit is exceeded for an individual group, the aggregation fails
with an error.

Examples
--------

Consider a ``gamescores`` collection with the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.gamescores.insertMany([
      { playerId: "PlayerA", gameId: "G1", score: 31 },
      { playerId: "PlayerB", gameId: "G1", score: 33 },
      { playerId: "PlayerC", gameId: "G1", score: 99 },
      { playerId: "PlayerD", gameId: "G1", score: 1 },
      { playerId: "PlayerA", gameId: "G2", score: 10 },
      { playerId: "PlayerB", gameId: "G2", score: 14 },
      { playerId: "PlayerC", gameId: "G2", score: 66 },
      { playerId: "PlayerD", gameId: "G2", score: 80 }
   ])

Find the Maximum Three ``Scores`` for a Single Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``$maxN`` accumulator to find the maximum three scores
in a single game.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.gamescores.aggregate( [
      {
         $match : { gameId : "G1" }
      },
      {
         $group:
            {
               _id: "$gameId",
               maxThreeScores:
                  {
                     $maxN:
                     {
                        input: ["$score","$playerId"],
                        n:3
                     }
                  }
            }
      }
   ] )

The example pipeline:

- Uses :pipeline:`$match` to filter the results on a single ``gameId``. 
  In this case, ``G1``.
- Uses :pipeline:`$group` to group the results by ``gameId``. In this 
  case, ``G1``.
- Specifies the fields that are input for ``$maxN`` with
  ``input : ["$score","$playerId"]``.
- Uses ``$maxN`` to return the maximum three score elements
  for the ``G1`` game with ``n : 3``.

The operation returns the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
      {
         _id: 'G1',
         maxThreeScores: [ [ 99, 'PlayerC' ], [ 33, 'PlayerB' ], [ 31, 'PlayerA' ] ]
      }
   ]

Finding the Maximum Three Scores Across Multiple Games
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``$maxN`` accumulator to find the maximum ``n``
scores in each game.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.gamescores.aggregate( [
      {
         $group:
         { 
            _id: "$gameId", 
            maxScores:
               {
                  $maxN:
                     {
                        input: ["$score","$playerId"],
                        n: 3
                     }
               }
         }
      }
   ] )
   
The example pipeline:

- Uses ``$group`` to group the results by ``gameId``.
- Uses ``$maxN`` to return the maximum three score elements
  for each game with ``n: 3``.
- Specifies the fields that are input for ``$maxN`` with
  ``input: ["$score","$playerId"]``.

The operation returns the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
      {
         _id: 'G1',
         maxScores: [ [ 99, 'PlayerC' ], [ 33, 'PlayerB' ], [ 31, 'PlayerA' ] ]
      },
      {
         _id: 'G2',
         maxScores: [ [ 80, 'PlayerD' ], [ 66, 'PlayerC' ], [ 14, 'PlayerB' ] ]
      }
   ]

Computing ``n`` Based on the Group Key for ``$group``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also assign the value of ``n`` dynamically. In this example,
the :expression:`$cond` expression is used on the ``gameId`` field.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 11

   db.gamescores.aggregate([
      {
         $group:
         {
            _id: {"gameId": "$gameId"},
            gamescores:
               {
                  $maxN:
                     {
                        input: ["$score","$playerId"],
                        n: { $cond: { if: {$eq: ["$gameId","G2"] }, then: 1, else: 3 } }
                     }
               }
         }
      }
   ] )

The example pipeline:

- Uses ``$group`` to group the results by ``gameId``.
- Specifies the fields that input for ``$maxN`` with
  ``input : ["$score","$playerId"]``.
- If the ``gameId`` is ``G2`` then ``n`` is 1, otherwise ``n`` is 3.

The operation returns the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   [
      { _id: { gameId: 'G2' }, gamescores: [ [ 80, 'PlayerD' ] ] },
      {
         _id: { gameId: 'G1' },
         gamescores: [ [ 99, 'PlayerC' ], [ 33, 'PlayerB' ], [ 31, 'PlayerA' ] ]
      }
   ]
