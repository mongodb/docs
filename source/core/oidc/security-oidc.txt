MongoDB Enterprise supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 
authentication and authorization for both human users and applications.
These protocols enable Workforce and Workload Identity Federation, which 
streamline authentication and authorization by integrating with external 
identity providers. This lets you simplify your security management and 
enhance your system's scalability and flexibility.

Use Cases
---------

Workload and Workforce Identity Federation use OIDC and OAuth 2.0 as 
follows: 

- Workforce Identity Federation uses OIDC to enable human users to 
  authenticate and get authorized using an external identity provider (IdP).

- Workload Identity Federation uses OAuth 2.0 to enable your applications to 
  access MongoDB using external programmatic identities such as Azure Service 
  Principals, Azure Managed Identities, and Google Service Accounts.

Behavior
--------

To use Workforce and Workload Identity Federation, you must use MongoDB 
Enterprise and have MongoDB 7.0.11 or later.
