Now that you have a basic AI agent, you can continue developing it by: 

- Improving the :ref:`performance <avs-performance-tuning>` of your vector search tools and :ref:`fine tuning <rag-fine-tuning>` your RAG pipelines.
- Adding more tools to the agent, such as :ref:`hybrid <as_hybrid-search>` or :ref:`full-text search <atlas-search>` tools.
- Refining the planning phase by using more advanced prompts and LLM calls.
- Implementing long-term memory and more advanced memory systems by using 
  :ref:`{+fts+} <atlas-search>` and :ref:`{+avs+} <avs-overview>`
  to store and retrieve important interactions across sessions.
