Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to run a **text query** in the MongoDB
Kotlin driver.

You can use a text query to retrieve documents that contain a **term**
or a **phrase** in a specified field. A term is a sequence of characters
that excludes whitespace characters. A phrase is a sequence of terms
with any number of whitespace characters. 

The following sections show you how to perform the following types of
text queries:

- Query Text by a Term
- Query Text by a Phrase
- Query Text with Terms Excluded

If you want to sort your text query results, see the :ref:`Text Query
<sorts-crud-text-search>` section of our Sort Results guide. 

Sample Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections feature examples of text queries on the
``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection. Each section uses a variable
named ``collection`` to refer to the ``MongoCollection`` instance of the
``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection. 

The ``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection contains documents that
describe one of the several movies that are part of the Fast and Furious
movie franchise. Each document contains a title field and a tags field.

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": 1, "title": "2 Fast 2 Furious ", "tags": ["undercover", "drug dealer"] } 
   { "_id": 2, "title": "Fast 5", "tags": ["bank robbery", "full team"] }
   { "_id": 3, "title": "Furious 7", "tags": ["emotional"] }
   { "_id": 4, "title": "The Fate of the Furious", "tags": ["betrayal"] }

This data is modeled with the following Kotlin data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/SearchTextTest.snippet.search-data-model.kt
   :language: kotlin

Text Index
~~~~~~~~~~

You must create a **text index** before running a text query. A text
index specifies the string or string array field on which to run a text
query.

In the following examples, you run text queries on the ``title``
field in the ``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection. To enable text
queries on the ``title`` field, create a text index using the
:ref:`Indexes <index-text-indexes>` builder with the following snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/SearchTextTest.snippet.text-index.kt
   :language: kotlin

For more information, see the following resources:

- :ref:`Text Indexes <text-indexes>` section of our Indexes guide
- :manual:`Text Indexes </core/index-text/>` Server Manual Entry


Text Query
----------

Use the ``Filters.text()`` method to specify a text query. 

The ``Filters.text()`` method uses the :ref:`Filters builder
<filters-builders>` to define a query filter specifying
what to search for during the text query. The query filter is
represented by a :ref:`BSON <bson>` instance. Pass the query filter to the
``find()`` method to run a text query. 

When you execute the ``find()`` method, MongoDB runs a text query on
all the fields indexed with the text index on the collection. MongoDB
returns documents that contain one or more of the query terms and a
relevance score for each result. For more information on relevance
scores, see the :ref:`Text Query <sorts-crud-text-search>` section in
our Sort Results guide.  

Specify Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can include ``TextSearchOptions`` as the second parameter of the
``Filters.text()`` method to specify text query options such as case
sensitivity. By default, text queries run without case sensitivity
which means the query matches lowercase and uppercase values.

To specify a case sensitive query, use the following snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/SearchTextTest.snippet.specify-options.kt
   :language: kotlin

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API Documentation:

- `Filters.text() <{+core-api+}/client/model/Filters.html#text(java.lang.String)>`__
- `TextSearchOptions <{+core-api+}/client/model/TextSearchOptions.html>`__

.. _term_search:

Query Text by a Term
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pass a term as a string to the ``Filters.text()`` method to specify the
term in your text query. 

Example 
```````

The following example runs a text query on the documents in the
``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection for titles that contain the
term "fast":

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/SearchTextTest.snippet.search-term.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

      Movies(id=1, title=2 Fast 2 Furious, tags=[undercover, drug dealer])
      Movies(id=2, title=Fast 5, tags=[bank robbery, full team])

To match multiple terms in your text query, separate each term
with spaces in the ``Filters.text()`` builder method. The builder method
returns the text query as a ``Bson`` instance. When you pass
this to the ``find()`` method, it returns documents that match any of
the terms.

Example 
```````

The following example runs a text query on the documents in the
``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection for titles that contain the
terms "fate" or "7":

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/SearchTextTest.snippet.search-multiple-terms.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

      Movies(id=3, title=Furious 7, tags=[emotional])
      Movies(id=4, title=The Fate of the Furious, tags=[betrayal])

Query Text by a Phrase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pass a phrase with **escaped quotes** to the ``Filters.text()`` method to
specify the phrase in your text query. Escaped quotes are double quote
characters preceded by a backslash character. If you don't add escaped
quotes around the phrase, the ``find()`` method runs a :ref:`term search
<term_search>`. 

Example 
```````

The following example runs a text query on the documents in the
``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection for titles that contain the
phrase "fate of the furious":

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/SearchTextTest.snippet.search-phrase.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

      Movies(id=4, title=The Fate of the Furious, tags=[betrayal])
 
Query Text with Terms Excluded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each term you want to exclude from your text query, prefix the term
with a minus sign in the string that you pass to the ``Filters.text()``
builder method. 

None of the documents returned from the query contain the excluded term
in your text index field. 

.. important::

   You must have at least one text query term if you want to
   exclude terms from your query. 

Example 
```````

The following example runs a text query on the documents in the
``fast_and_furious_movies`` collection for titles that contain the
term "furious", but do not contain the term "fast":

.. io-code-block::

   .. input:: /examples/generated/SearchTextTest.snippet.exclude-term.kt
      :language:  kotlin

   .. output:: 
      :language:  console

      Movies(id=3, title=Furious 7, tags=[emotional])
      Movies(id=4, title=The Fate of the Furious, tags=[betrayal])
