|charts| offers several customization options which modify the
representation of a chart's X and Y value axes without affecting the
formatting of the data points in the visualization.

.. note::

   A value axis shows a continuous scale of values. Charts such as
   :ref:`Bar/Column <column-bar-chart-ref>` and
   :ref:`Discrete Line/Area <discrete-charts>` have just one
   value axis. :ref:`Continuous line and area <continuous-charts>`
   and :ref:`scatter <scatter-chart-ref>` charts have two value
   axes.

.. _max-min-options:

Max and Min
-----------

The :guilabel:`Max` and :guilabel:`Min` value axis options allow
you to specify maximum and minimum values to display on a chart.
Any data points with values outside the specified limits appear at
the boundaries of the chart. Setting a maximum display value
is useful for removing outlying data from the chart and
allowing the viewer to focus on more relevant information.

.. note::

   Changing the minimum for bar and column charts from the default
   of zero is not recommended. Doing so means the length of the
   bars is no longer proportional to the data point values.

Available for the following chart types: all :ref:`Bar/Column
<column-bar-chart-ref>` except 100% stacked,
:ref:`Discrete and Continuous Line
<line-area-chart-ref>`, :ref:`Discrete and Continuous Area
<discrete-charts>`, :ref:`Scatter <scatter-chart-ref>`

Logarithmic Scale
-----------------

Toggling the :guilabel:`Logarithmic Scale` switch to the
:guilabel:`On` position causes your chart
to use a logarithmic scale instead of a linear scale for data
values. Using a logarithmic scale is helpful for showing
the percentage change from one value to the next and for charts
with a large value differential from smallest to largest. Data sets
such as stock market movements, earthquake strength measurements, and
global population sizes are good use cases for a logarithmic scale
chart.

Logarithmic Scale Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use the :guilabel:`Logarithmic Scale` option only with chart data
  that consists of either all positive values or all negative values.
  If the chart includes a mix of positive and negative values, or if
  it includes the value ``0``, the chart will not render.

- Bar and column charts normally have a baseline of ``0``, but
  logarithmic scale charts have a baseline of ``1`` because
  ``log(0)`` is undefined. As a result, charts with data points between
  ``0`` and ``1`` do not render well. You can mitigate this effect by
  setting the :ref:`axis minimum <max-min-options>` of the chart to
  a value greater than zero but smaller than the lowest value in the
  data set.

Available for the following chart types: :ref:`Grouped and
Colored Bar/Column <column-bar-chart-ref>`, :ref:`Discrete and
Continuous Line <line-area-chart-ref>`, :ref:`Scatter
<scatter-chart-ref>`

Label Override
--------------

The :guilabel:`Label Override` field allows you to create a
custom axis label. Custom labels can be more descriptive
than the default labels and help chart viewers quickly grasp
the significance of chart data.

The Label Override customization option is available on the ``X``
or ``Y`` value axis for charts in which the author has encoded multiple
data series by mapping more than one field on a given axis.
To customize the axis label for charts that have a single field mapped,
use the Label Override option within that field's customization
options.

Available for the following chart types: :ref:`Bar/Column
<column-bar-chart-ref>`, :ref:`Line <line-area-chart-ref>`,
:ref:`Area <line-area-chart-ref>`, :ref:`Scatter <scatter-chart-ref>`
