Use Interjections with Care
===========================

.. include:: /includes/styles/corrections.rst

An interjection is an emotional greeting or phrase, usually followed by
an exclamation point.

.. example::

   Expressions such as *Hooray!*, *Excuse me!*, *Sorry!*, *No thank
   you!*, *Oh dear!*, and *Hey, that's mine!* are interjections.

In rare cases, an interjection might be appropriate in technical
content.

.. example::

   At the end of a procedure that targets novice users, you might
   write, "Congratulations! You successfully created your first Atlas
   cluster."

The tone of an interjection can be condescending. Use them sparingly and with care.
