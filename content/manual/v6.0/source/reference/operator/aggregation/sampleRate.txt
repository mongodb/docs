Definition
----------

.. expression:: $sampleRate

   Matches a random selection of input documents. The number of
   documents selected approximates the sample rate expressed as a
   percentage of the total number of documents.

   The :expression:`$sampleRate` operator has the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { $sampleRate: <non-negative float> }

Behavior
--------

The selection process uses a uniform random distribution. The sample
rate is a floating point number between 0 and 1, inclusive, which
represents the probability that a given document will be selected as it
passes through the pipeline.

For example, a sample rate of ``0.33`` selects roughly one document in
three.

This expression:

.. code-block:: javascript

    { $match: { $sampleRate: 0.33 } }

is equivalent to using the :expression:`$rand` operator as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { $match: { $expr: { $lt: [ { $rand: {} }, 0.33 ] } } }

Repeated runs on the same data will produce different outcomes since
the selection process is non-deterministic. In general, smaller
datasets will show more variability in the number of documents
selected on each run. As collection size increases, the number of
documents chosen will approach the expected value for a uniform random
distribution.

.. note::

   If an exact number of documents is required from each run, the
   :pipeline:`$sample` operator should be used instead of ``$sampleRate``.

Examples
--------

This code creates a small collection with 100 documents.

.. code-block:: javascript

   N = 100
   bulk = db.collection.initializeUnorderedBulkOp()
   for ( i = 0; i < N; i++) { bulk.insert( {_id: i, r: 0} ) }
   bulk.execute()

The ``$sampleRate`` operator can be used in a pipeline to select random
documents from the collection. In this example we use ``$sampleRate``
to select about one third of the documents.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.aggregate(
      [
        { $match: { $sampleRate: 0.33 } },
        { $count: "numMatches" }
      ]
   )

This is the output from 5 runs on the sample collection:

.. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { "numMatches" : 38 }
      { "numMatches" : 36 }
      { "numMatches" : 29 }
      { "numMatches" : 29 }
      { "numMatches" : 28 }
