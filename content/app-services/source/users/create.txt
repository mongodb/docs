Overview
--------

Atlas App Services provides various :ref:`authentication providers <authentication-providers>`
to log users into your app. For most providers, App Services automatically creates a 
user account the first time a user authenticates through the provider. The only exception is 
:ref:`email/password user authentication <create-email-password-user>`, which requires 
registering and confirming a user before the user can authenticate.

.. include:: /includes/apple-account-deletion-requirements.rst

Identity
--------

When you first log in with an authentication provider, App Services creates a 
:ref:`user object <user-objects>` that contains a unique identity ID and 
:ref:`provider-specific metadata <auth-provider-metadata>` about the user.

Link to Existing Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A single user object can have more than one identity. You can use the Realm SDKs 
to link identities to existing user accounts. This allows users to log in to 
a single account with more than one provider. For more information, see the 
documentation on linking identities for your preferred SDK:

- :ref:`Link User Identities - Flutter SDK <flutter-link-user-identities>`
- :ref:`Link User Identities - Java SDK <java-link-user-identities>`
- :ref:`Link User Identities - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-link-user-identities>`
- :ref:`Link User Identities - .NET SDK <dotnet-link-user-identities>`
- :ref:`Link User Identities - Node.js SDK <node-link-user-identities>`
- :ref:`Link User Identities - React Native SDK <react-native-link-user-identities>`
- :ref:`Link User Identities - Swift SDK <ios-link-user-identities>`
- :ref:`Link User Identities - Web SDK <web-link-user-identities>`

Create an Email/Password User
-----------------------------

When you use :ref:`email/password user authentication 
<email-password-authentication>`, you must first register a user, which creates 
the user object. You can register users in your client application
using your preferred SDK or you can manually create email/password users.

After registering the user, you must :ref:`confirm the user <confirm-user>` 
before they can authenticate.

Create an Email/Password User in the SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each SDK offers an API that enables you to register an email/password user. 
After registering the user, you must confirm the user before the they can 
authenticate. For code examples that demonstrate how to manage email/password 
users in the client application, see the documentation for the Realm SDKs:

- :ref:`Create Email/Password Users - C++ SDK <cpp-manage-users>`
- :ref:`Create Email/Password Users - Flutter SDK <flutter-manage-email-password-users-register>`
- :ref:`Create Email/Password Users - Java SDK <java-register-a-new-user-account>`
- :ref:`Create Email/Password Users - Kotlin SDK <kotlin-manage-email-password-users>`
- :ref:`Create Email/Password Users - .NET SDK <dotnet-email-password-register-new-user>`
- :ref:`Create Email/Password Users - Node SDK <node-register-new-user>`
- :ref:`Create Email/Password Users - React Native SDK <react-native-register-new-user>`
- :ref:`Create Email/Password Users - Swift SDK <ios-register-a-new-user-account>`
- :ref:`Create Email/Password Users - Web SDK <web-manage-email-password-users>`

Manually Create an Email/Password User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a new :ref:`Email/Password <email-password-authentication>` user
from the App Services UI, CLI, or Admin API. Manually-created users bypass any 
configured user confirmation flows.

.. tip::
   
   Manually creating a user can be useful for testing and debugging your application in
   development.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      #. Select :guilabel:`App Users` from the left navigation menu.
      
      #. Click the :guilabel:`Add New User` button.
      
      #. Specify an email address and password for the new user.
      
         .. note::
      
            The Email/Password authentication provider requires passwords to be
            between 6 and 128 characters long.
      
      #. Click :guilabel:`Create`.
      
      .. note::
         
         You can also create API keys that applications use to connect to your
         App. Although API Keys are not associated with
         a single user, the :guilabel:`Users` tab lists them. To learn more
         about API keys, see :doc:`API Key Authentication
         </authentication/api-key>`.
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      To create a new email/password user, call ``{+cli-bin+} users create`` and
      specify ``--type=email``. The CLI will prompt you for your App ID as well
      as the new user's email and password.
      
      .. code-block:: bash
         
         {+cli-bin+} users create --type=email
      
      You can also specify the arguments when you call the program:
      
      .. code-block:: bash
         
         {+cli-bin+} users create --type=email \
           --app=<Your App ID> \
           --email=<User's Email Address> \
           --password=<User's Password>
         
      .. note::
         
         The Email/Password authentication provider requires passwords to be
         between 6 and 128 characters long.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      To create a new email/password user, create a ``POST`` request 
      in the following format. You must specify the user credentials 
      in the request body and the Group and App ID in the request URL.

      .. code-block:: sh

         curl --request POST \
           --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
           --data '{ "email": "<string>", "password": "<string>" }' \
           https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/<groupId>/apps/<appId>/users

      .. note::
         
         The Email/Password authentication provider requires passwords to be
         between 6 and 128 characters long.

      .. seealso::
       
         :admin-api-endpoint:`Admin API Documentation <operation/adminCreateUser>`

.. _confirm-user:

Confirm a User
--------------

You must confirm the email address of new
:doc:`Email/Password users </authentication/email-password>`
before they are permitted to log into App Services. The
exact method of confirmation depends upon your provider
configuration, but typically involves a
:wikipedia:`handshake process <Handshaking>` between the
user and your application. You can read more about
Email/Password user confirmation at :ref:`Email/Password
Confirmation <email-password-authentication-confirmation>`.

Sometimes, users are unable to complete the confirmation
process. For example:

- An overzealous spam filter might block App Services email confirmation
  emails.

- A proxy or web blocker could prevent a user from activating the
  ``confirmUser`` client SDK function via the client application.

- An implementation error could cause the client application's user
  confirmation page to fail for specific use cases.

To help you work around cases like this, you can confirm
users manually using the App Services UI or the Admin API:

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      To confirm a pending email/password user in the UI:

      #. Select :guilabel:`App Users` from the left navigation menu.

      #. Under the :guilabel:`Users` tab, select the :guilabel:`PENDING`
         button.

      #. Find the user in the list and click on the ellipsis (``...``).

      #. Select the :guilabel:`Confirm User` option from the context menu that
         appears.

      #. If the operation succeeds, the banner at the top of the App Services
         admin console should display a confirmation message. The user's
         :guilabel:`User Status` changes from :guilabel:`Pending Confirmation`
         to :guilabel:`Pending User Login`.

      A manually-confirmed user continues to appear in the :guilabel:`PENDING`
      user list until they log in to your application for the first time, at
      which point App Services moves them into the list of confirmed users and
      transitions their :guilabel:`User Status` to ``confirmed``.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      To confirm a pending email/password user using the Admin API, create 
      a ``POST`` request in the following format. You must specify the Group 
      ID, App ID, and email address.

      .. code-block:: sh

         curl --request POST \
           --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
           https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/<groupId>/apps/<appId>/user_registrations/by_email/<email>/confirm

      .. seealso::
       
         :admin-api-endpoint:`Admin API Documentation <operation/adminConfirmPendingUser>`

Re-run the User Confirmation Workflow
-------------------------------------

A few circumstances can lead to incomplete Email/Password user
confirmation workflows:

- An email is caught by a spam filter, not delivered due to a bug, or
  accidentally deleted by a prospective App Services user.

- A custom confirmation function is unable to communicate with an
  unconfirmed user due to a bug or oversight.

- An unconfirmed user forgot to visit their confirmation link within 30
  minutes of receiving their login tokens, and the tokens expired.

Users caught in this situation appear stuck in an unconfirmed state.
Since an existing account has their email registered to it, users cannot
create a new account with the same email address. Also, they cannot log
into an account that is not confirmed.

Applications that use the built-in email confirmation service of App Services
can use the ``resendConfirmationEmail`` Client SDK method to send a new
email with a new confirmation link to the user, allowing them to confirm
their account and log in. Calling this method will result in an error by
any application using a confirmation flow other than ``send a
confirmation email``.

There is no such specific method to re-run a custom confirmation
function. Instead, App Services has a method to trigger a re-run of whatever
the current Email/Password user confirmation workflow happens to be. You
can manually re-run the currently selected user confirmation flow using
the App Services UI or the :doc:`App Services Admin API </admin/api/v3>`:

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      To re-run the confirmation workflow for a user in the UI:

      #. Select :guilabel:`App Users` from the left navigation menu.

      #. Under the :guilabel:`Users` tab, select the :guilabel:`PENDING`
         button.

      #. Find the user in the list and click on the ellipsis (``...``).

      #. Select the :guilabel:`Run user confirmation` option from the context
         menu that appears.

      #. Select the :guilabel:`Run User Confirmation` button in the dialogue
         box that appears.

      #. If the operation succeeds, the banner at the top of the App Services
         admin console should display a confirmation message. The user's
         :guilabel:`User Status` changes from :guilabel:`Pending Confirmation`
         to :guilabel:`Pending User Login`. Once the user logs in, they will
         move into the list of active users automatically.

      If the re-run fails or the user's tokens expire again, you can re-run
      the confirmation function as many times as necessary.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: api

      To re-run the confirmation workflow for a user using the Admin API, create a 
      ``POST`` request in the following format. You must specify the Group ID, App ID, 
      and email address.

      .. code-block:: sh

         curl --request POST \
           --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
           https://services.cloud.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/<groupId>/apps/<appId>/user_registrations/by_email/<email>/run_confirm

      .. seealso::
       
         :admin-api-endpoint:`Admin API Documentation <operation/adminRerunPendingUserConfirmation>`
