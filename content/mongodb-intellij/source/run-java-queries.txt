   :description: Use the MongoDB for IntelliJ Plugin to run Java queries in the Database Explorer Playgrounds.

Definition
----------

The {+intellij-full+} enables you to run queries written in Java directly 
in the Database Explorer Playgrounds. 

The Run icon appears next to your MongoDB queries.

   :alt: Click the Run icon to convert your Java query to mongosh syntax.

Behavior
--------

When you click the Run icon, the plugin automatically converts your 
Java query to ``mongosh`` syntax and opens a Playground file with the 
populated query.

For field values that are variables determined at runtime, the plugin 
creates a placeholder variable. You can populate this placeholder with 
a test value and run the query in the Playground. 

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+intellij-short+} does not generate insights in the
side panel for the following Java and Spring queries:

- Any query or aggregation that does not use a BSON builder exposed 
  by the MongoDB Java Driver. This includes parts of queries 
  and aggregations written using the following constructors: 
  
  - Documents
  - BasicDBObjects 
  - BasicDBLists 
  - BasicDBObjectBuilders

- Queries that use unsupported BSON builder methods provided by 
  the MongoDB Java Driver. For a list of Java Driver methods 
  that can be used for generating insights by the {+intellij-short+},
  see :ref:`java-driver-methods-introspection`.

- Queries that use unsupported methods provided by Spring Data 
  MongoDB. For a list of Spring Data methods 
  that can be used for generating insights by the {+intellij-short+},
  see :ref:`spring-criteria-methods-introspection`.

Example
-------

In this example, the Java query on the ``production.trips`` collection
resembles the following:

.. code:: java
   :copyable: false

   public List<Document> findCompletedTripsByDriver(String driverId) {
      return trips.find(Filters.and(
              Filters.eq(fieldName: "trip_status", value: "completed"),
              Filters.eq(fieldName: "driver_id", driverId)
      )).into(new ArrayList<>());
   }

The following code example shows the converted query from the Java code 
above:

.. code:: javascript
   :copyable: true

   var driver_id = "<driver ID>"

   db.getSiblingsDB("production")
     .getCollection("trips")
     .find({
        "$and" : [
           { "trip_status" : "completed" },
           { "driver_id" : driver_id }
         ],
     })

In this example, ``driver_id`` is a variable that holds a value 
determined at runtime. In order to test that your query outputs the 
results you expect, you must specify a test value by replacing 
``<driver ID>`` with the driver ID. For example, 
``driver_id = "1a2b3c4d5e"``.

Once you are satisfied with the query, you can run it in the Playground 
and view the query results.
