A *project* provides access to a distinct deployment of MongoDB clusters,
replica sets and standalone processes. Users must be members of a project
to access the projectâ€™s deployment. When you register as a new |mms|
user, you either join an existing project or create a new one.

A project provides access to a distinct deployment of MongoDB clusters, replica
sets and standalone processes. Users must be members of a project to access the
project's deployment. When you register as a new |mms| user, you must choose
whether to join an existing project or create a new one.

The user who creates a project automatically has the :ref:`Owner
<owner-role>` role for the project and can manage user access.

You can create multiple projects. Each project has its own Monitoring,
Backup and Automation Agents associated with the project. For a project,
the Monitoring Agent must be able to connect to all hosts it monitors.
If you have segregated environments separated by firewalls, you must
create separate |mms| projects for each environment.

Working with Multiple Environments
----------------------------------

If you have multiple MongoDB systems in distinct environments and cannot
monitor all systems with a single agent, you will need to add a new project.
Having a second project makes it possible to run two agents.

You may also use a second project and agent to monitor a different set of
MongoDB instances in the same environment if you want to segregate the hosts
within the |mms| console. A user can only view data from the hosts monitored in
a single project at once.

Create a Project
----------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a project for an organization, you must be either an
Organization Owner or an Organization Project Creator.

When you create a project, you are added as an Owner for the project.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

Choose a name for your project. |mms| automatically adds you as the first
user to the project and assigns the project a set of default :doc:`alert configurations
</tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`.

.. _remove-group:
.. _delete-project:

Delete a Project
----------------

.. only:: cloud

   Deleting a project removes all the project's artifacts, including all user
   and monitoring data. |mms| no longer displays the project in selection
   lists.

   You can delete a project if:

   - You have the :ref:`Owner <owner-role>` role for the project.

   - The project has no outstanding invoices.

   - The project has no backups. To terminate your backups prior to removing
     the project, see :ref:`terminate-backup`.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. only:: onprem

   Please contact your |mms| administrator to delete a project
   from your |mms| account.

   If you have administrative privileges, you can delete a project through
   system administration. Click :guilabel:`Admin`, then :guilabel:`General`,
   and then :guilabel:`Projects`.
