ref: point-to-app-db
pre: |
  Open the ``<install-dir>/conf/conf-daemon.properties`` file and set the
  :setting:`mongo.mongoUri` value to the servers and ports hosting the
  |application| Database. For example:
action:
  language: cfg
  code: |
    mongo.mongoUri=mongodb://mongodb1.example.net:27017,mongodb2.example.net:27017,mongodb3.example.net:27017

  Additionally, ensure that the file system that holds the
  :setting:`rootDirectory` has sufficient space to accommodate the
  current snapshots of all backed up instances.

stepnum: 5
ref: sync-genkey
content: |
  Use ``scp`` to copy the ``gen.key`` file from the ``/etc/mongodb-mms/``
  directory on the |application| server to the ``/etc/mongodb-mms/``
  directory on the Backup Daemon.

  If you installed the |application| from an archive instead of an ``rpm``
  package, the gen key is located in the ``${HOME}/.mongodb-mms/`` directory.
