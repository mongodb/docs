Combo charts offer a combined :ref:`column <column-bar-chart-ref>` and 
:ref:`line <line-area-chart-ref>` view.

Combo Chart Encoding Channels
-----------------------------

Combo charts provide the following
:ref:`encoding channels <encoding-channels>`:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Encoding Channel
     - Description

   * - X Axis
     - In the :guilabel:`category` axis encoding channel, a column is 
       rendered for each unique value from this field.

   * - Columns
     - - The fields that you use in this channel build the columns in 
         this chart.      

       - The :guilabel:`aggregation` axis encoding channel dictates
         which field to aggregate on and the type of aggregation to
         perform. This ultimately dictates the size of each column.

       You can map multiple fields to this channel to create 
       a multi-series chart. However, unlike other charts, you can't 
       create a multi-series chart with the :guilabel:`Series` 
       channel on combo charts. To learn more, see
       :ref:`Multiple Field Mappings <multiple-field-mappings>`.

   * - Lines
     - - The fields that you use in this channel build one or more 
         lines on this chart.      

       - The :guilabel:`aggregation` axis encoding channel dictates
         which field to aggregate on and the type of aggregation to
         perform.

Combo Chart Types
-----------------

Combo charts provide the following sub-types:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Sub-Type Name
     - Description

   * - :ref:`Grouped <grouped-combo-ref-example>`
     - |charts| groups data by the category specified in the
       :guilabel:`category` :ref:`encoding channel
       <encoding-channels>`, and plots a column for each value
       in the :guilabel:`Columns` encoding channel.

   * - :ref:`Stacked <stacked-combo-ref-example>`
     - |charts| creates a column for each distinct value in the
       :guilabel:`category` :ref:`encoding channel <encoding-channels>`
       field, and splits each column into segments based on the
       the :guilabel:`Columns` encoding channel.

Use Case
--------

Combo charts bring together the useful aspects of both :ref:`column 
<column-bar-chart-ref>` and :ref:`line <line-area-chart-ref>` charts 
into a single chart.

Customization Options
---------------------

The following customization options are specific to combo
charts. To see all available customization options, see
:ref:`customize-charts`.

.. note::

   If the columns and lines in your combo use different scales, 
   consider a :ref:`secondary-y-axis`. This option appears on the 
   :guilabel:`Customize` pane in the :guilabel:`Fields` section for any 
   fields mapped to the :guilabel:`Lines` channel. Fields mapped to the 
   :guilabel:`Columns` channel appear only on the primary axis.

.. _label-angle-option:

Adjust X-Axis Label Angle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/customization/adjust-x-axis-label-angle.rst

Set Distinct Dash Style per Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On combo charts, you can opt to display each series in the chart with a 
distinct dash style. This option can help make your chart more 
accessible by distinguishing between series beyond color.

.. include:: /includes/customization/set-distinct-dash-style-per-series.rst

.. _line-smoothing-option:

Smooth Lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/customization/smooth-lines.rst

.. _markers-option:

Show or Hide Data Markers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On combo charts, you can dictate whether |charts-short| displays
visible data markers that represent individual data points along the 
line. Enabling this option makes it easier to see exactly where your 
data points lie along a line. Hovering over these markers shows the 
exact data values in a tooltip, making it easier to view precise 
measurements.

.. include:: /includes/customization/show-hide-data-markers.rst

Show or Hide Data Value Labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/customization/show-hide-data-labels.rst

Examples
--------

.. _grouped-combo-ref-example:

Grouped Combo Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following grouped combo chart shows the number of award 
nominations, wins, and metascores by director.

The :guilabel:`X Axis` category of ``director`` creates a group
for each director in the data set, and each group is split by the
:guilabel:`Columns` encoding channel fields of ``nominations`` and 
``wins``. The :guilabel:`Lines` encoding channel field of 
``metacritic`` displays as a line:

.. figure:: /images/charts/combo-chart-grouped.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Grouped Combo Chart Reference

.. _stacked-combo-ref-example:

Stacked Combo Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following stacked combo chart shows the number of award 
nominations, wins, and metascores by director.

The :guilabel:`X Axis` category of ``director`` creates a column for 
each director in the data set, :ref:`limited <charts-limit-data>` to 
only the top 10 as sorted by the aggregated sum of ``awards.wins`` from 
:guilabel:`Columns`. The :guilabel:`Columns` encoding channel fields of 
``nominations`` and ``wins`` segment each column. The :guilabel:`Lines` 
encoding channel field of ``metacritic`` displays as a line:

.. figure:: /images/charts/combo-chart-stacked.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Stacked Combo Chart Reference

Limitations
-----------

The maximum query response size for combo charts is 5000 
documents.
