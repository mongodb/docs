Behavior
--------

Session Identification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB concatenates each of the specified UUIDs with the hash of the
authenticated user credentials to identify the user's sessions to kill.
If the user has no session that match, the :dbcommand:`killSessions`
has no effect.

.. include:: /includes/note-killSessions.rst

   
Example
-------

The following operation kills the specified session for the user:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { killSessions: [ { id: UUID("f9b3d8d9-9496-4fff-868f-04a6196fc58a") } ] } )
