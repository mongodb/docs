===================================
Retrieve Distinct Values of a Field
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can retrieve a list of distinct values for a field across a
collection by calling the ``distinct()`` method on a ``MongoCollection``
object. Pass the document field name as the first parameter and the class
you want to cast the results to as the second parameter as shown below:

.. code-block:: java

   collection.distinct("countries", String.class);

You can specify a field on the document or one within an **embedded document**
using **dot notation**. The following method call returns each distinct
value of the ``wins`` field in the ``awards`` embedded document:

.. code-block:: java

   collection.distinct("awards.wins", Integer.class);

You can optionally pass a query filter to the method document to limit
the set of documents from which the distinct values are retrieved as
follows:

.. code-block:: java

   collection.distinct("type", Filters.eq("languages", "French"), String.class);

The ``distinct()`` method returns an object that implements the
``DistinctIterable`` interface. This interface contains methods to access,
organize, and traverse the results. It also inherits methods from its parent
interface, ``MongoIterable``, such as ``first()`` which returns the first
result and ``cursor()`` which returns an instance of a ``MongoCursor``.


Example
-------

The following snippet retrieves a list of distinct values for the ``year``
document field from the ``movies`` collection. It uses a query document to
match movies that include "Carl Franklin" as one of the values in the
``directors`` array.

.. include:: /includes/connect-guide-note.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/Distinct.java
   :language: java

.. note::

   If you are using the **legacy API**, see the :doc:`FAQ </faq>` to determine
   what changes you need to make to this code example.

When you run the example, you should see output that reports each distinct
year for all the movies that Carl Franklin was included as a director
which should resemble the following:

.. code-block:: none

   1992
   1995
   1998
   ...
