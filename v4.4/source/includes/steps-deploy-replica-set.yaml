title: "Start each member of the replica set with the appropriate options."
level: 4
ref: start-mongod
content: |

   For each member, start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance with the
   following settings:

   - Set :setting:`replication.replSetName` option to the replica set 
     name. If your application connects to more than one replica set, 
     each set must have a distinct name.

   - Set :setting:`net.bindIp` option to the hostname/ip or a comma-delimited
     list of hostnames/ips.

   - Set any other settings as appropriate for your deployment.

   In this tutorial, the three :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances are
   associated with the following hosts:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Replica Set Member
        - Hostname

      * - Member 0
        - ``mongodb0.example.net``

      * - Member 1
        - ``mongodb1.example.net``

      * - Member 2
        - ``mongodb2.example.net``

   The following example specifies the replica set name and the ip
   binding through the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` and :option:`--bind_ip <mongod --bind_ip>`
   command-line options:

   .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

   .. code-block:: bash

      mongod --replSet "rs0" --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

   For ``<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>``, specify the hostname(s) and/or
   ip address(es) for your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that remote
   clients (including the other members of the replica set) can use to
   connect to the instance.

   Alternatively, you can also specify the :setting:`replica set name
   <replication.replSetName>` and the :setting:`ip addresses
   <net.bindIp>` in a :doc:`configuration file
   </reference/configuration-options>`:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      replication:
         replSetName: "rs0"
      net:
         bindIp: localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

   To start :binary:`~bin.mongod` with a configuration file, specify the
   configuration file's path with the :option:`--config <mongod
   --config>` option:
         
   .. code-block:: bash

      mongod --config <path-to-config>

   In production deployments, you can configure a :term:`init script`
   to manage this process. Init scripts are beyond the scope of this
   document.

title: "Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to one of the ``mongod`` instances."
level: 4
ref: open-shell
pre: |

  From the same machine where one of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` is running
  (in this tutorial, ``mongodb0.example.net``), start the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
  shell. To connect to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` listening to localhost on
  the default port of ``27017``, simply issue:
action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongo
post: |

  Depending on your path, you may need to specify the path to the
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` binary.

  From the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, run :method:`rs.initiate()` on
  replica set member 0.

  .. important::

     .. include:: /includes/fact-rs-initiate-once-only.rst

  .. include:: /includes/tip-hostnames.rst

  code: |
    rs.initiate( {
       _id : "rs0",
       members: [
          { _id: 0, host: "mongodb0.example.net:27017" },
          { _id: 1, host: "mongodb1.example.net:27017" },
          { _id: 2, host: "mongodb2.example.net:27017" }
