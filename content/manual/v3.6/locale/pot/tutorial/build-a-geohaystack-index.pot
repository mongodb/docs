msgid "A haystack index must reference two fields: the location field and a second field. The second field is used for exact matches. Haystack indexes return documents based on location and an exact match on a single additional criterion. These indexes are not necessarily suited to returning the closest documents to a particular location."

msgid "To build a haystack index, you must specify the ``bucketSize`` option when creating the index. A ``bucketSize`` of ``5`` creates an index that groups location values that are within 5 units of the specified longitude and latitude. The ``bucketSize`` also determines the granularity of the index. You can tune the parameter to the distribution of your data so that in general you search only very small regions. The areas defined by buckets can overlap. A document can exist in multiple buckets."
