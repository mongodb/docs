|service-fullname| and other cloud services like {+fts+} store essential operational 
data in dedicated databases within your cluster. These databases use specific, reserved 
prefixes to clearly separate internal service data from your user data. 

.. important:: Do not access or modify databases with the prefix *__mdb_internal_*.

The primary naming convention for databases reserved for internal use by 
|service-fullname| and other cloud services is ``__mdb_internal_<service-name>``. 
You could impact the stability and availability of your services if you modify 
these databases. We recommend that you ignore these namespaces in administrative tools.

The following internal databases may be present in your cluster:

- ``__mdb_internal_atlas``: Used by {+service+} for internal operations, including 
  an automated test workload that runs on every replica set and sharded cluster to measure 
  read/write availability.

- ``__mdb_internal_search``: Used by MongoDB Search to store its catalog information. This
  database may be present in self-hosted, community deployments that use MongoDB Search.

MongoDB Server, see :ref:`metadata-system-collections`.
