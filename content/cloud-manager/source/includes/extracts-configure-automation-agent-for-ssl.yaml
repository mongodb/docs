  .. note::

     |mms| can manage |tls-ssl| for you if you are using Automation for
     the deployment. With Automation, |mms| prompts you for the
     certificates to use to connect to the deployment when you enable
     |tls-ssl| and then configures the agents appropriately. To learn
     how to configure |tls-ssl|, see
     :doc:`/tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment`.
