The ``2d`` index supports queries that calculate distances on a
Euclidean plane (flat surface). The index also supports the following
query operators and command that calculate distances using spherical
geometry:

.. note:: While basic queries using spherical distance are supported by
   the ``2d`` index, consider moving to a ``2dsphere`` index if your
   data is primarily longitude and latitude.


- :query:`$nearSphere`

- :query:`$centerSphere`

- :query:`$near`

- :pipeline:`$geoNear` pipeline stage with the ``spherical: true`` option

- :dbcommand:`geoNear` command (Deprecated in MongoDB 4.0) with the
  ``spherical: true`` option.

.. important:: The aforementioned operations use radians for distance. Other
   spherical query operators do not, such as :query:`$geoWithin`.

   For spherical query operators to function properly, you must convert
   distances to radians, and convert from radians to the distances units
   used by your application.

   To convert:

   - *distance to radians*: divide the distance by the radius of the
     sphere (e.g. the Earth) in the same units as the distance
     measurement.

   - *radians to distance*: multiply the radian measure by the radius
     of the sphere (e.g. the Earth) in the units system that you want to
     convert the distance to.

   The equatorial radius of the Earth is approximately ``3,963.2``
   miles or ``6,378.1`` kilometers.

The following query would return documents from the ``places``
collection within the circle described by the center ``[ -74, 40.74 ]``
with a radius of ``100`` miles:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.places.find( { loc: { $geoWithin: { $centerSphere: [ [ -74, 40.74 ] ,
                                                        100 / 3963.2 ] } } } )
