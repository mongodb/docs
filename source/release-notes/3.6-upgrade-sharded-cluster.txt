Default Bind to Localhost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances bind to localhost by default. Remote clients, including other
members of the replica set, cannot connect to an instance bound only to
localhost. To override and bind to other ip addresses, use the
:setting:`net.bindIp` configuration file setting or the ``--bind_ip``
command-line option to specify a list of ip addresses.

The upgrade process will require that you specify the
:setting:`net.bindIp` setting (or ``--bind_ip``) if your sharded
cluster members are run on different hosts or if you wish remote
clients to connect to your sharded cluster.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Version |oldversion| or Greater
    To upgrade a sharded cluster to |newversion|, **all** members of the
    cluster must be at least version |oldversion|. The upgrade process checks
    all components of the cluster and will produce warnings if any
    component is running version earlier than |oldversion|.

- Feature Compatibility Version
    The |oldversion| sharded cluster must have
    ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``3.4``. 

    To ensure that all members of the sharded cluster have
    ``featureCompatibilityVersion`` set to ``3.4``, connect to each
    shard replica set member and each config server replica set member
    and check the ``featureCompatibilityVersion``:

    .. tip::

       For a sharded cluster that has access control enabled, to run the
       following command against a shard replica set member, you must
       connect to the member as a :ref:`shard local user
       <shard-local-users>`.

    .. cssclass:: copyable-code

    .. code-block:: javascript

       db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )

    All members should return a result that includes
    ``"featureCompatibilityVersion": "3.4"``.

    To set or update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``, run the
    following command on the :binary:`~bin.mongos`:

    .. cssclass:: copyable-code

    .. code-block:: javascript

       db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4" } )

    For more information, see
    :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

- Shard Aware
    The shards in the |oldversion| sharded clusters must be shard aware
    (i.e. the shards must have received their ``shardIdentity``
    document):

    - For sharded clusters that started as |oldversion|, the shards are
      shard aware.

    - For |oldversion| sharded clusters that were upgraded from
      |olderseries|, when you update ``featureCompatibilityVersion``
      from ``3.2`` to ``3.4``, the config server attempts to send the
      shards their respective ``shardIdentity`` document every 30
      seconds until success. You must wait until all shards receive the
      documents.

- Avoid Metadata Changes during the Upgrade
    *Optional but Recommended.* During the upgrade, if possible, avoid
    making changes to the collection metadata; for example, avoid
    performing any of the following operations:

    - :method:`sh.enableSharding()`

    - :method:`sh.shardCollection()`

    - :method:`sh.addShard()`

    - :method:`db.createCollection()`

    - :method:`db.collection.drop()`

    - :method:`db.dropDatabase()`

    - any operation that creates a database

    - any other operation that modifies the cluster metadata in any way.

    See the :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list of sharding
    commands. Not all commands on the :doc:`/reference/sharding` page
    modify the cluster metadata.

- :ref:`Disable the balancer <sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily>`

- Back up the ``config`` Database
    *Optional but Recommended.* As a precaution, take a backup of the
    ``config`` database *before* upgrading the sharded cluster.

Download |newversion| Binaries
------------------------------

Use Package Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade-with-package-mgr.rst

Download |newversion| Binaries Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the `MongoDB Download
Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs>`_.

See :doc:`/installation` for more information.
