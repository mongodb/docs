Overview

.. _`MongoDB Download Center`: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community?jmp=docs

The following tutorial uses a package manager to install MongoDB
{+version+} Community Edition on LTS Ubuntu Linux systems.

.. admonition:: Production Notes
   :class: note

   Before deploying MongoDB in a production environment, consider the
   :doc:`/administration/production-notes` document.

.. |package-name| replace:: ``{+package-name-org+}``
.. |distro-name| replace:: Ubuntu

MongoDB Version

other versions of MongoDB, refer to the corresponding version of the
manual.

Run MongoDB Community Edition

   Production Notes
      Before deploying MongoDB in a production environment, consider the
      :doc:`/administration/production-notes` document.

   ulimit Considerations
      .. include:: /includes/fact-installation-ulimit.rst

   .. |mongod-user| replace:: ``mongodb``
   .. |mongod-datadir| replace:: ``/var/lib/mongodb``

   Directories
      If you installed via the package manager, the data directory
      |mongod-datadir| and the log directory ``/var/log/mongodb`` are
      created during the installation.

      By default, MongoDB runs using the |mongod-user| user account. If
      you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you **must** also
      modify the permission to the data and log directories to give this
      user access to these directories.

   Configuration File
      The official MongoDB package includes a :ref:`configuration file
      <conf-file>` (:file:`/etc/mongod.conf`). These settings (such as the
      data directory and log directory specifications) take effect
      upon startup. That is, if you change the configuration file while
      the MongoDB instance is running, you must restart the instance for the
      changes to take effect.

.. important::

   The following instructions assume that you have downloaded the  
   official MongoDB ``mongodb-org`` packages, and not the unofficial  
   ``mongodb`` package provided by Ubuntu. 

.. include:: /includes/steps/run-mongodb-on-debian.rst

.. seealso::

   The recommended procedure to install is through the package manager,
   as detailed on this page. However, if you choose to install by
   directly downloading the ``.tgz`` file, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu-tarball`.
