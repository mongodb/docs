"In MongoDB, write operations, e.g. :method:`db.collection.update()`, "
":method:`db.collection.findAndModify()`, "
":method:`db.collection.remove()`, are atomic on the level of a single "
"document. For fields that must be updated together, embedding the fields "
"within the same document ensures that the fields can be updated "
"atomically."

"For example, consider a situation where you need to maintain information "

"The available copies of the book and the checkout information should be "

"field within the same document ensures that you can update the two fields"

"Then to update with new checkout information, you can use the "
