   .. step:: Configure application for MongoDB

      To configure your application to use MongoDB and {+odm+} as your
      ODM, run the following command from the root of your project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         bin/rails g mongoid:config

      After the command completes successfully, your application
      contains the ``config/mongoid.yml`` file to configure the
      connection to the MongoDB deployment. Your application also
      includes the ``config/initializers/mongoid.rb`` file for more
      advanced configuration.

   .. step:: Specify target database in connection string
      
      When connecting to an Atlas cluster, you must specify the database that
      you want to interact with as the default database in your connection string.
      You must add the database name to your connection string *after the hostname*.
      
      The following example specifies the ``sample_restaurants`` target database
      in a sample connection string:

      .. code-block:: none

         mongodb+srv://user0:pass123@mongo0.example.com/sample_restaurants

   .. step:: Specify connection in mongoid.yml
      
      Paste the following configuration into the ``config/mongoid.yml`` file,
      making sure to replace the ``<connection string>`` placeholder
      with your connection string that references the target database:

      .. code-block:: yaml
         :emphasize-lines: 4

         development:
           clients:
             default:
               uri: <connection string>

After completing these steps, your Rails web application is ready to
connect to MongoDB.
