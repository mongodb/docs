      ``restaurants`` collection, sorted first by the ``borough`` field in
      ascending order, and then, within each borough, by the ``"address.zipcode"``

  To specify an order for the result set, pass to the ``find`` method
  an options parameter that specifies the sort order. The sort options
  take a document that contains the field(s) to sort by and the
  corresponding sort type, e.g. {{ascKey}} for ascending and
  {{descKey}} for descending.
