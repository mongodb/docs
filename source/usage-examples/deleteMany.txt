=========================
Delete Multiple Documents
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can delete multiple documents from a collection in a single operation
by calling the ``deleteMany()`` method on a ``MongoCollection`` object.

To specify which documents to delete, pass a query filter that matches
the documents you want to delete. If you provide an empty document,
MongoDB matches all documents in the collection and deletes them. While
you can use ``deleteMany()`` to delete all documents in a collection,
consider using the ``drop()`` method instead for better performance.

Upon successful delete, this method returns an instance of
``DeleteResult``. You can retrieve information such as the number of
documents deleted by calling the ``getDeletedCount()`` method on the
``DeleteResult``.

If your delete operation fails, the driver raises an exception. For more
information on the types of exceptions raised under specific conditions,
see the API documentation for ``deleteMany()``, linked at the bottom of
this page.

Example
-------

The following snippet deletes multiple documents from the ``movies``
collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database. 

The query filter passed tothe ``deleteMany()`` method matches all
movie documents that contain a ``rating`` of less than **1.9** in the ``imdb``
sub-document.

.. note::

   If you are using the **legacy API**, see the :doc:`faq </faq>` to determine
   what changes you need to make to this code example.

When you run the example, you should see output that reports the number of
documents deleted in your call to ``deleteMany()``.

.. code-block:: none

   Deleted document count: 4
