Overview
--------

Indexes are data structures that support the efficient execution of queries in
MongoDB. They contain copies of parts of the data in documents to make
queries more efficient.

Without indexes, MongoDB must scan *every* document in a collection to find
the documents that match each query. These collection scans are slow and can
negatively affect the performance of your application. By using an index to
limit the number of documents MongoDB scans, queries can be more efficient
and therefore return faster.


Query Coverage and Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you execute a query against MongoDB, your query can include three
parts:

- Query criteria that specify one or more fields and values that you are looking for
- Options that affect the query's execution, such as read concern
- Projection criteria to specify the fields you want MongoDB to return (optional)

When all the fields specified in the query criteria and projection of a
query are indexed, MongoDB returns results directly from the index
without scanning any documents in the collection or loading them into
memory.

For more information on how to ensure your index covers your query
criteria and projection, see the MongoDB manual articles on
:manual:`query coverage </core/query-optimization/#read-operations-covered-query>`
and :manual:`index intersection </core/index-intersection>`.

Operational Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To improve query performance, build indexes on fields that appear often in your
application's queries and operations that return sorted results. Each index that you add
consumes disk space and memory when active, so it might be necessary to track index memory
and disk usage for capacity planning. In addition, when a write operation updates an
indexed field, MongoDB also updates the related index.

For more information on designing your data model and choosing indexes
appropriate for your application, see the {+mdb-server+} documentation on
:manual:`Indexing Strategies </applications/indexes>` and
:manual:`Data Modeling and Indexes </core/data-model-operations/#data-model-indexes>`.

List Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``listIndexes()`` method to list all the indexes
for a collection. The `listIndexes() <{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#listIndexes>`__ method takes an
optional `ListIndexesOptions
<{+api+}/types/ListIndexesOptions.html>`__ parameter. The ``listIndexes()`` method returns an
object of type `ListIndexesCursor
<{+api+}/classes/ListIndexesCursor.html>`__.

The following code uses the ``listIndexes()`` method to list all the
indexes in a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/listIndexes.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start listIndexes example
   :end-before: end listIndexes example

Index Types
-----------

MongoDB supports several different index types to support querying
your data. The following sections describe the most common index types
and provide sample code for creating each index type.

Single Field Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Single field indexes** are indexes that improve performance for queries
that specify ascending or descending sort order on a single field of a
document.

The following example uses the ``createIndex()`` method to create an
ascending order index on the ``title`` field in the ``movies`` collection in
the ``sample_mflix`` database.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/single-field.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-idx
   :end-before: end-idx
   :dedent:

The following is an example of a query that is covered by the index
created above.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/single-field.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-query
   :end-before: end-query
   :dedent:

To learn more, see  :manual:`Single Field Indexes </core/index-single>`.

Compound Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Compound indexes** are indexes that improve performance for queries that
specify ascending or descending sort order for *multiple* fields of
a document. You must specify the direction (ascending or descending) for
each field in the index.

The following example uses the ``createIndex()`` method to create a compound
index on the ``type`` and ``genre`` fields in the ``movies`` collection in the
``sample_mflix`` database.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/compound.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-idx
   :end-before: end-idx
   :dedent:

The following is an example of a query that is covered by the index
created above.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/compound.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-query
   :end-before: end-query
   :dedent:

To learn more, see  :manual:`Compound Indexes </core/index-compound>`.

Multikey Indexes (Indexes on Array Fields)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multikey indexes** are indexes that improve the performance of queries on
fields that contain array values.

You can create a multikey index on a field with an array value by
calling the ``createIndex()`` method. The following code creates an ascending
index on the ``cast`` field in the ``movies`` collection of the
``sample_mflix`` database:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/multikey.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-idx
   :end-before: end-idx
   :dedent:

The following code queries the multikey index to find
documents in which the ``cast`` field value contains ``"Viola Davis"``:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/multikey.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-query
   :end-before: end-query
   :dedent:

Multikey indexes behave differently from non-multikey indexes in terms of
query coverage, index bound computation, and sort behavior. For a full
explanation of multikey indexes, including a discussion of their behavior
and limitations, see the :manual:`Multikey Indexes page
</core/index-multikey>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

Clustered Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Clustered indexes** are indexes that improve the performance of
insert, update, and delete operations on **clustered collections**.
Clustered collections store documents ordered by the clustered index key
value.

To create a clustered index, specify the ``clusteredIndex`` option in
the ``CollectionOption``. The ``clusteredIndex`` option must specify the
``_id`` field as the key and the unique field as ``true``.

The following example uses the ``createCollection()`` method to create a
clustered index on the ``_id`` field in the ``vendors`` collection of the
``tea`` database.

.. code-block:: javascript

   const db = client.db('tea');
   await db.createCollection('ratings', {
     clusteredIndex: {
       key: { _id: 1 },
       unique: true
     }
   });

To learn more, see
:v6.0:`Clustered Indexes </reference/method/db.createCollection/#std-label-db.createCollection.clusteredIndex>` and
:v6.0:`Clustered Collections </core/clustered-collections>`.

.. _node-fundamentals-text-indexes:

Text Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Text indexes** support text search queries on string content. These indexes
can include any field whose value is a string or an array of string elements.

MongoDB supports text search for various languages, so you can specify the
default language as an option when creating the index. You can also
specify a weight option to prioritize certain text fields in your
index. These weights denote the significance of fields relative to the
other indexed fields.

To learn more about text searches, see our guide on :ref:`text search queries <node-fundamentals-text>`.

The following example uses the ``createIndex()`` method to perform the
following actions:

- Create a ``text`` index on the ``title`` and ``body`` fields in the
  ``blogPosts`` collection
- Specify ``english`` as the default language
- Set the field weight of ``body`` to ``10`` and ``title`` to ``3``

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/text.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-idx
   :end-before: end-idx
   :dedent:

The following query uses the text index created in the preceding code:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/text.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-query
   :end-before: end-query
   :dedent:

To learn more about text indexes, see :manual:`Text Indexes
</core/index-text>` in the Server manual.

Geospatial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports queries of geospatial coordinate data using **2dsphere
indexes**. With a 2dsphere index, you can query the geospatial data for
inclusion, intersection, and proximity. For more information on querying
geospatial data with the MongoDB Node.js driver, read our
:doc:`Search Geospatial </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/geo>` guide.

To create a 2dsphere index, you must specify a field that contains
only **GeoJSON objects**. For more details on this type, see the MongoDB
Server manual page on :manual:`GeoJSON objects </reference/geojson>`.

The ``location.geo`` field in following sample document from the
``theaters`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database is a GeoJSON Point
object that describes the coordinates of the theater:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("59a47286cfa9a3a73e51e75c"),
      "theaterId" : 104,
      "location" : {
         "address" : {
            "street1" : "5000 W 147th St",
            "city" : "Hawthorne",
            "state" : "CA",
            "zipcode" : "90250"
         },
         "geo" : {
            "type" : "Point",
            "coordinates" : [
               -118.36559,
               33.897167
            ]
         }
      }
   }

The following example uses the ``createIndexes()`` method to create a
``2dsphere`` index on the ``location.geo`` field in the ``theaters``
collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database to enable geospatial searches.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/geo.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-idx
   :end-before: end-idx
   :dedent:

MongoDB also supports ``2d`` indexes for calculating distances on a
Euclidean plane and for working with the "legacy coordinate pairs" syntax
used in MongoDB 2.2 and earlier. To learn more, see
:manual:`Geospatial Queries </geospatial-queries>`.

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Unique indexes** ensure that the indexed fields do not store duplicate
values. By default, MongoDB creates a unique index on the ``_id`` field
during the creation of a collection. To create a unique index, specify the
field or combination of fields that you want to prevent duplication on and
set the ``unique`` option to ``true``.

The following example uses the ``createIndex()`` method to create a unique
index on the ``theaterId`` field in the ``theaters`` collection of the
``sample_mflix`` database.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/unique.js
   :language: js
   :start-after: begin-idx
   :end-before: end-idx
   :dedent:

If you attempt to perform a write operation that stores a duplicate value
that violates the unique index, MongoDB will throw an error that resembles
the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   E11000 duplicate key error index

To learn more, see :manual:`Unique Indexes </core/index-unique>`.

.. _node-indexes-search:

Search Indexes
--------------

Atlas Search is a feature that allows you to perform full-text
searches. To learn more, see the :ref:`Atlas Search <fts-top-ref>`
documentation.

Before you can perform a search on an Atlas collection, you must first
create an Atlas Search index on the collection. An Atlas Search
index is a data structure that categorizes data in a searchable format.

You can use the following methods to manage your Search indexes:

- ``createSearchIndex()``
- ``createSearchIndexes()``
- ``listSearchIndexes()``
- ``updateSearchIndex()``
- ``dropSearchIndex()``

The following sections provide code samples that use each of the preceding
methods to manage Search indexes.

Create a Search Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the `createSearchIndex()
<{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#createSearchIndex>`__ and
`createSearchIndexes() <{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#createSearchIndexes>`__
methods to create new Search indexes.

The following code shows how to
use the ``createSearchIndex()`` method to create an index called
``search1``:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/searchIndexes.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start createSearchIndex example
   :end-before: end createSearchIndex example

When connecting to {+mdb-server+} v6.0.11 and later v6 versions, or
v7.0.2 and later v7 versions, you can use the driver to create an Atlas
Vector Search index on a collection. Learn more about this feature in
the :atlas:`Atlas Vector Search documentation
</atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>`.

The following code shows how to use the ``createSearchIndex()`` method
to create a search index in which the ``type`` field is
``vectorSearch``:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/searchIndexes.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start vectorSearchIdx example
   :end-before: end vectorSearchIdx example

List Search Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the `listSearchIndexes()
<{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#listSearchIndexes>`__
method to return a cursor that contains the Search indexes of a given
collection. The ``listSearchIndexes()`` method takes an optional string
parameter, ``name``, to return only the indexes with matching names. It
also takes an optional `aggregateOptions <{+api+}/interfaces/AggregateOptions.html>`__ parameter.

The following code uses the ``listSearchIndexes()`` method to list the
Search indexes in a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/searchIndexes.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start listSearchIndexes example
   :end-before: end listSearchIndexes example

Update a Search Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the `updateSearchIndex()
<{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#updateSearchIndex>`__ method to update a Search
index.

The following code shows how to
use the ``updateSearchIndex()`` method to update an index called
``search1`` to specify a string type for the ``description`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/searchIndexes.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start updateSearchIndex example
   :end-before: end updateSearchIndex example

Drop a Search Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the `dropSearchIndex()
<{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#dropSearchIndex>`__ method to remove a Search
index.

The following code shows how to
use the ``dropSearchIndex()`` method to remove an index called
``search1``:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/indexes/searchIndexes.js
   :language: javascript
   :dedent:
   :start-after: start dropSearchIndex example
   :end-before: end dropSearchIndex example
