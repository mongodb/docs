         - 64-bit version of Excel. Run the following command to

           .. code-block:: sh

              file -N /Applications/Microsoft\ Excel.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft\ Excel

           For information on upgrading to the 64-bit version of Excel,

           .. note::

              Both the 64-bit and 32-bit versions of iODBC are
              included with the installer. If you use iODBC to test your
              DSN, you must use the 64-bit version of the application.

              iODBC is not recommended for creating or modifying your
              :doc:`Data Source Name (DSN) </tutorial/create-system-dsn>`.
              To create or modify your DSN, use the ODBC Manager
              application that is included with the MongoDB ODBC driver.

         - Create a system :doc:`Data Source Name (DSN) </tutorial/create-system-dsn>`
