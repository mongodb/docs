title: Create the ``systemd`` unit file.
stepnum: 1
level: 4
ref: create-systemd
action:
  - pre: |
      Create the following file at ``/etc/systemd/system/disable-transparent-huge-pages.service``:

    language: sh
    code: |
      [Unit]
      Description=Disable Transparent Huge Pages (THP)
      DefaultDependencies=no
      After=sysinit.target local-fs.target
      Before=mongod.service

      [Service]
      Type=oneshot
      ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'echo never | tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled > /dev/null'

      [Install]
      WantedBy=basic.target

      .. note::

         Some versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and potentially
         other Red Hat-based derivatives, use a different path
         for the THP ``enabled`` file:

         .. code-block:: sh

            /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled
         
         Check to see which path is in use on your system, and update
         the ``disable-transparent-huge-pages.service`` file
         accordingly.

      .. note::

         Prior to version 4.2, MongoDB also checks the THP *defrag*
         setting and presents a startup warning if defrag is
         enabled. As long as THP itself is disabled in
         the ``systemd`` unit file, MongoDB is unaffected by the defrag
         setting. However, to avoid this message, you may set defrag to
         ``never`` by adding the following additional line to the
         ``systemd`` unit file, just after the existing ``ExecStart``
         statement:
         
         .. code-block:: sh

            ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'echo never | tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag > /dev/null'

         If on Red Hat or similar, the path to the ``defrag`` file
         might be different. See the note above for more details, and
         and update the ``disable-transparent-huge-pages.service`` file
         accordingly.

title: Reload ``systemd`` unit files.
stepnum: 2
level: 4
ref: reload-systemd
action:
  - pre: |
      Run the following command to reload ``systemd`` unit files to make
      ``disable-transparent-huge-pages.service`` available for use:

    language: sh
    code: sudo systemctl daemon-reload
---
title: Start the service.
stepnum: 3
level: 4
ref: start-service
action:
  - pre: |
      Start the service manually once to ensure that the appropriate THP
      setting has been changed:

    language: sh
    code:
      sudo systemctl start disable-transparent-huge-pages

  - pre: |
      Verify that THP has successfully been set to ``[never]`` by running the
      following command:

    language: sh
    code:
       cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

  - pre: |
      On Red Hat Enterprise Linux and potentially other Red Hat-based
      derivatives, you may instead need to use the following:

    language: sh
    code:
       cat /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled
---
title: Configure your operating system to run it on boot.
stepnum: 4
level: 4
ref: configure-systemd-enable
action:
  - pre: |
      To ensure that this setting is applied each time your system
      boots, run the following command:

    language: sh
    code:
         sudo systemctl enable disable-transparent-huge-pages
---
title: "Customize tuned / ktune profile, if applicable."
stepnum: 5
level: 4
ref: customize-tuned-profile
action:
  - pre: |
      If you are using ``tuned`` or ``ktune`` on
      :abbr:`RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)`/ CentOS,
      you must now also create a custom ``tuned`` profile.
