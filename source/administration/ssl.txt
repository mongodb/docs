SSL Support
===========

This document outlines the use and operation of MongoDB's SSL
support. The `default distribution of MongoDB Binaries`_ does **not**
contain support for SSL.

.. _`default distribution of MongoDB Binaries`: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

.. note:: 

   As of the current release, to use SSL you must either: build
   MongoDB locally passing the "``--ssl``" option to ``scons``, or use
   the `MongoDB subscriber build <http://www.10gen.com/mongodb-subscriber-edition-download>`_.

These instructions assume that you have already installed one of these
MongoDB builds, and outline the use and operation of MongoDB with
SSL.

``mongod`` SSL Use
------------------

Add the following command line options to your :program:`mongod` invocation:

.. code-block:: sh

     mongod --sslOnNormalPorts --sslPEMKeyFile <pem> --sslPEMKeyPassword <pass>

Replace "``<pem>``" with the path to your SSL certificate ``.pem``
file, and "``<pass>``" with the password you used to encrypt the
``.pem`` file.

You may also specify these options in your "``mongodb.conf``" file with
following options:

.. code-block:: conf

   sslOnNormalPorts = true
   sslPEMKeyFile = /etc/ssl/mongodb.pem
   sslPEMKeyPassword = pass

Modify these values to reflect the location of your actual ``.pem``
file and its password.

You can use any existing SSL certificate, or you can generate your own
SSL certificate using a command that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd /etc/ssl/
   openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out mongodb-cert.pem -keyout mongodb-cert.key

To create the combined ``.pem`` file that contains the ``.key`` file
and the ``.pem`` certificate, use the following command: 

.. code-block:: sh

   cat mongodb-cert.crt mongodb-cert.pem > mongodb.pem  

Clients
-------

Clients must have support for SSL to work with a :program:`mongod`
instance that has SSL support enabled. The current versions of the
Python, Java, Ruby, and Node.js drivers have support for SSL, with
full support coming in future releases of other drivers.

``mongo``
~~~~~~~~~

The :program:`mongo` shell distributed with the subscriber build also
supports SSL using the "``--ssl``" flag. See the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --ssl --host <host>

MMS
~~~

The MMS agent will also have to connect via SSL in order to gather its
stats.  Because the agent already utilizes SSL for its communications
to the MMS servers, this is just a matter of enabling SSL support in
MMS itself on a per host basis.

This is done by using the “Edit” host button (i.e. the pencil) on the
Hosts page in the MMS console and is currently enabled on a group by
group basis by 10gen.

Please see the `MMS Manual <http://mms.10gen.com/help>`_ for more
information about MMS configuration.

PyMongo
~~~~~~~

Add the "``ssl=True``" parameter to a PyMongo connection to create a
MongoDB connection to an SSL MongoDB instance:

.. code-block:: python

   from pymongo import Connection
   c = Connection(host="mongodb.example.net", port=27017, ssl=True)

Do the following if you're connecting to a replica set:

.. code-block:: python

   from pymongo import ReplicaSetConnection
   c = ReplicaSetConnection("mongodb.example.net:27017",
                            replicaSet="mysetname", ssl=True)

PyMongo also supports an "``ssl=true``" option for the MongoDB URI::

   mongodb://mongodb.example.net:27017/?ssl=true

Java
~~~~

Consider the following example "``sslApp.java``" class file:

.. code-block:: java

   import com.mongodb.*;
   import javax.net.ssl.SSLContext;

   public class sslApp {

   public static void main(String args[])
        throws Exception {

        MongoOptions o = new MongoOptions();
        o.socketFactory = SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();

       Mongo m = new Mongo( "localhost" , o );

       DB db = m.getDB( "test" );
        DBCollection c = db.getCollection( "foo" );

       System.out.println( c.findOne() );

   }
   }

Ruby
~~~~

The recent versions version of the Ruby driver have support for
connections to SSL servers. Install the latest version of the driver
with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   gem install mongo

Then connect to a standalone instance, using the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   require ‘rubygems’
   require ‘mongo’

   connection = Mongo::Connection.new(‘localhost’, 27017, :ssl => true)

Replace ``connection`` with the following if you're connecting to a
replica set:

.. code-block:: ruby

   connection = Mongo::ReplSetConnection.new([‘localhost, 27017’],
                                             [‘localhost’, 27018],
                                             :ssl => true)

Here, :program:`mongod` instance run on "``localhost:27017``" and
"``localhost:27018``".

Node.JS (``node-mongodb-native``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the `node-mongodb-native`_ driver, use the following invocation to
connect to an :program:`mongod` instance via SSL:

.. code-block:: javascript 

   var db1 = new Db(MONGODB, new Server("127.0.0.1", 27017,
                                        { auto_reconnect: false, poolSize:4, ssl:ssl } );

To connect to a replica set via SSL, use the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var replSet = new ReplSetServers( [
       new Server( RS.host, RS.ports[1], { auto_reconnect: true } ),
       new Server( RS.host, RS.ports[0], { auto_reconnect: true } ),
       ],
     {rs_name:RS.name, ssl:ssl}
   );
