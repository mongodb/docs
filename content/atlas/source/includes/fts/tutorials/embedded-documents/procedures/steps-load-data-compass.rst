Create a Sample Collection and Load the Data 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must begin by creating a collection named ``schools`` in an 
existing or new database on your |service| {+cluster+}. After creating the 
collection, you must upload the sample data into your collection. To
learn more about the documents in the sample collection, see
:ref:`embedded-documents-tutorial-sample-collection`. 

The steps in this section walk you through creating a new database 
and collection, and loading the sample data into your collection.

Create and populate the ``schools`` collection:

.. procedure:: 
  :style: normal

  .. step:: Connect to your |service| cluster using |compass|.

     Open {+Compass+} and connect to your |service| cluster. For
     detailed instructions, see :ref:`atlas-connect-via-compass`. 

  .. step:: Create the collection.

     On the :guilabel:`Database` screen, create a database named ``local_school_district``, then select
     :guilabel:`Create Collection`. 

  .. step:: Specify the collection name. 

     Enter ``schools`` as the collection name and select :guilabel:`Create Collection`.

  .. step:: Load sample data into the collection.

     a. Select the ``schools`` collection if it's not already
        selected.
  
     #. Click :guilabel:`Add Data` for each of the sample 
        documents to add to the collection.

     #. Click :guilabel:`Insert Document` to replace the default 
        document.
  
     #. Copy and paste the following sample documents, one at a time, 
        and click :guilabel:`Insert` to add the documents, one at a 
        time, to the collection.
