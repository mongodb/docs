Resolve Pre-flight Check Failure
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

When you start |onprem| in :guilabel:`Local Mode`, |onprem| performs a
*pre-flight check*. This check verifies if you downloaded all the
MongoDB binary archives for at least one platform of the needed MongoDB
versions to the :setting:`Versions Directory` on the |onprem| server.
If these binaries were not downloaded, |onprem| fails this check and
stops.

To pass the pre-flight check, you can either:

- Install all of the binaries for every version of MongoDB you need in
  the :setting:`Versions Directory` or

- Reconfigure |onprem| temporarily so it can start, then change the
  versions of MongoDB your |onprem| server supports.

This tutorial outlines the steps to configure |onprem| temporarily to
resolve the pre-flight check failure and return to :guilabel:`Local
Mode` setting.

Change Configuration File to Allow |onprem| to Start

Return to Local Mode
--------------------

Once you have resolved the pre-flight check errors, proceed with the
following steps to run |onprem| in :guilabel:`Local Mode`.

If these steps are not completed, |onprem| remains in Internet mode and
displays a notice in the configuration page notifying you that the
:guilabel:`Local Mode` setting in your ``conf-mms.properties``
overrides this setting.

To revert to :guilabel:`Local Mode`:
