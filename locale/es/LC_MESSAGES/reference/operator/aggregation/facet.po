"The ``$facet`` stage allows you to create multi-faceted aggregations "
"which characterize data across multiple dimensions, or facets, within a "
"single aggregation stage. Multi-faceted aggregations provide multiple "
"filters and categorizations to guide data browsing and analysis. A common"
" implementation of faceting is how many online retailers provide ways to "
"narrow down search results by applying filters on product price, "
"manufacturer, size, etc."
