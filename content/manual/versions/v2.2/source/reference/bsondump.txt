Synopsis
--------

The :binary:`~bin.bsondump` converts :term:`BSON` files into human-readable
formats, including :term:`JSON`. For example, :binary:`~bin.bsondump` is useful
for reading the output files generated by :binary:`~bin.mongodump`.

.. important:: :binary:`~bin.bsondump` is a diagnostic tool for inspecting
   BSON files, not a tool for data ingestion or other application use.

Options
-------

.. binary:: bsondump

.. program:: bsondump

.. option:: --help

   Returns a basic help and usage text.

.. option:: --verbose, -v

   Increases the amount of internal reporting returned on the command
   line. Increase the verbosity with the ``-v`` form by including
   the option multiple times, (e.g. ``-vvvvv``.)

.. option:: --version

   Returns the version of the :binary:`~bin.bsondump` utility.

.. option:: --objcheck

   Validates each :term:`BSON` object before outputting it in :term:`JSON` format. Use
   this option to filter corrupt objects from the output. This option
   has some performance impact.

.. option:: --filter '<JSON>'

   Limits the documents that :binary:`~bin.bsondump` exports to only those
   documents that match the :term:`JSON document` specified as
   ``'<JSON>'``. Be sure to include the document in single quotes to
   avoid interaction with your system's shell environment.

.. option:: --type <=json|=debug>

   Changes the operation of :binary:`~bin.bsondump` from outputting ":term:`JSON`" (the
   default) to a debugging format.

.. option:: <bsonfilename>

   The final argument to :binary:`~bin.bsondump` is a document containing
   :term:`BSON`. This data is typically generated by
   :binary:`~bin.mongodump` or by MongoDB in a :term:`rollback` operation.

Usage
-----

By default, :binary:`~bin.bsondump` outputs data to standard output. To
create corresponding :term:`JSON` files, you will need to use the
shell redirect. See the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   bsondump collection.bson > collection.json

Use the following command (at the system shell) to produce debugging
output for a :term:`BSON` file:

.. code-block:: sh

   bsondump --type=debug collection.bson
