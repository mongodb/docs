   * - Cloud Service Provider and Region
     - You can deploy ``M0``  {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5``
       {+Shared-clusters+} only in a subset of regions on |aws|, |gcp|,
       and |azure|. To learn more about supported cloud provider regions
       for {+Free-clusters+} and {+Shared-clusters+}, see:

       - :ref:`Amazon Web Services (AWS) <amazon-aws>`
       - :ref:`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <google-gcp>`

   * - MongoDB Version and Storage Engine
     - |service| uses MongoDB 8.0 for ``M0/M2/M5`` clusters.

   * - MongoDB Version Upgrade
     - You can't upgrade the MongoDB version that ``M0/M2/M5`` clusters
       run. |service| upgrades ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} or ``M2/M5``
       {+Shared-clusters+} to the newest MongoDB version after several
       patch versions become available for that version. To learn more,
       see :manual:`MongoDB Versioning </reference/versioning>`.

     - You must select the ``M0`` {+cluster+} tier to deploy a
       {+Free-cluster+}. 

       You can deploy only one ``M0`` {+cluster+} per project. However
       if you have sales contracts with MongoDB, you might be able to deploy more ``M0``
       {+clusters+} per project. To learn more, contact a MongoDB sales
       representative.  

   * - Cluster Memory
     - You can't configure memory for ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} or ``M2/M5``
       {+Shared-clusters+}.

       {+cluster+} as a Sharded Cluster.

   * - Do You Want To Enable Backup
     - You can't enable backups on ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+}. 
     
       As an alternative to enabling backups, you can use |mongodump| to back 
       up your data and |mongorestore| to restore that data. To learn how 
       to use these MongoDB command line tools to manually back up your data, see 
       :doc:`Connect to a Cluster using Command Line Tools </command-line-tools>`.

   * - Test Primary Failovers
     - You can't perform primary failover testing on ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+}
       or ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+}.

   * - Simulate Regional Outage
     - You can't perform regional outage testing on ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+}
       or ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+}.

   * - Database Auditing

------------------

The following table lists the operational limits of |service|
``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+}:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - Operation
     - Limit

   * - :manual:`Aggregation </aggregation>` and :manual:`Queries </tutorial/query-documents/>`
     - |service| ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+}
       don't support the ``allowDiskUse`` option for the
       :manual:`aggregation command </reference/command/aggregate>`,

   * - |api| Access
     - While you can create an ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} using the 
       :oas-atlas-tag:`Clusters </Clusters>` |api| resource, you cannot 
       modify an ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} using the 
       :oas-atlas-tag:`Clusters </Clusters>` |api| resource. A subset of |api| 
       endpoints support ``M2`` and ``M5`` {+Shared-clusters+}.
       
       You can create an ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} using the
       :oas-atlas-tag:`Clusters </Clusters>` |api| resource. You 
       can create one ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} per project. However if
       you have sales contracts with MongoDB, you might be able to deploy more ``M0``
       {+clusters+} per project. To learn more, contact a MongoDB sales
       representative. 

   * - |service| Alerts
     - ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+} can
       only trigger alerts configured with one of the following
       :doc:`alert conditions </reference/alert-conditions>`:

       - Connections
       - Logical Size
       - Network
       - Opscounter

   * - |service| Monitoring
     - The :guilabel:`Metrics` view of an ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} or

       support :manual:`building indexes with a rolling build </tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets/>`.

   * - Change Streams Filtering
     - For ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+},
       you can use only strings and regular expressions in filters on
       database names (namespace ``ns`` fields) in
       :manual:`change streams </changeStreams/>`. You can't use commands,
       such as ``$in``, in database namespace filters. This limit
       doesn't apply to filtering on collection names in change streams.

   * - Cluster Persistence
     - |service| may deactivate idle ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} as per
       the :website:`Terms of Service </cloud-terms-and-conditions>`.

   * - Command Line Tools
     - .. include:: //includes/fact-database-tool-limitations-free.rst

       For ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+}, 
       you can't run |mongorestore| or |mongodump| on the ``admin`` 
       database. If you use the ``--db`` option to set the destination
       database to ``admin``, the program returns an error.
     
   * - Connections
     - ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+} can only
       have a maximum of 500 connections.

   * - Cursors

       :manual:`noTimeout cursor option </reference/method/cursor.addOption/#flags>`.

   * - Custom Roles
     - Changes to :doc:`custom roles </security-add-mongodb-roles>`
       might take up to 30 seconds to deploy in ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+}
       and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+}.

   * - Database and Collections
     - ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+} can have
       a maximum of 100 databases and 500 collections total.

   * - Database Commands
     - Certain database commands are unsupported or behave
       differently in an ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+}. To learn more, see
       :doc:`Command Limits in {+Free-Clusters+} </unsupported-commands>`.
       For questions or comments related to restricted commands,
       :ref:`contact support <request-support>`.

   * - Access to Collections in ``local``, ``admin``, and ``config`` Databases
     - ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+} don't
       allow:

       - Read access to any collection in the ``local`` database with
         the exception of read access to the oplog.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-regex-queries-shared-oplog.rst

       - Write access to any collection in the ``local`` and ``config`` 
         databases.

       - Read or write access to any collection in the ``admin`` 
         database.

       |service| issues an error similar to the following if you attempt
       to read or write to collections in these databases:

       .. code-block:: none
          :copyable: false

          command <cmd name> is not allowed in this Atlas tier
          (Unauthorized) not authorized on <db name> to execute command <cmd name>

   * - Database Logs
     - ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+} don't
       allow you to download logs.

   * - Data Recovery
     - .. include:: //includes/fact-backup-shared-tier-limitations.rst

   * - Data Transfer Limits
     - ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+} limit
       the total data transferred into or out of the {+cluster+} in a
       rolling seven-day period. The rate limits vary by {+cluster+} tier as
       follows:

       - ``M0``: 10 GB in and 10 GB out per period

       - ``M2``: 20 GB in and 20 GB out per period

       - ``M5``: 50 GB in and 50 GB out per period

       |service| handles {+clusters+} that exceed the rate limit as follows:

       - |service| throttles the network speed of the cluster.
       - |service| triggers a one second cooldown period before resuming
         the cluster's operations on a given connection. If the queue is
         greater than the operations per second limit, operations might
         wait for more than a second in the queue.
       - If the amount of transferred data drops below the rate limit
         threshold, |service| resumes processing of the queued data
         transfers on each connection before processing any new data
         transfers on that connection.

   * - Data Storage
     - ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+} limit
       the maximum total data storage space as follows:

       - ``M0``: 0.5 GB

       - ``M2``: 2 GB

       - ``M5``: 5 GB

       Data storage space includes the number of bytes of all
       uncompressed BSON documents stored in all collections, plus the
       bytes stored in their associated indexes.

   * - JavaScript
     - ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+} don't
       support server-side JavaScript. For example,
       :manual:`$where </reference/operator/query/where>` and
       :manual:`map-reduce </core/map-reduce>` are unsupported.

   * - Namespaces and Database Names
     - ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-cluster+} namespaces
       are limited to 95 bytes. Database names are limited to 38 bytes.

   * - Number of {+Free-Clusters+}
     - You can deploy at most *one* ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} per |service|
       project. However if you have sales contracts with MongoDB, you might be able to deploy
       more ``M0`` {+clusters+} per project. To learn more, contact a
       MongoDB sales representative. 

   * - Performance Advisor
     - ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+} don't
       provide access to the :doc:`Performance Advisor </performance-advisor>`. 

   * - Query Utilization
     - The percentage of time that a query is running over any five
       minute period must remain under 100% on ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+}
       and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+}.

   * - Real-Time Performance Panel
     - ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+} don't
       provide access to the :doc:`Real-Time Performance Panel </real-time-performance-panel>`.

   * - Sort in Memory
     - ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+}
       sort in memory limit is 32 MB.

   * - Throughput
     - ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} and ``M2/M5`` {+Shared-clusters+} limit
       the number of read and write operations per second. The rate limits 
       vary by {+cluster+} tier as follows:

       - ``M0``: 100 operations per second
       - ``M2``: 200 operations per second
       - ``M5``: 500 operations per second

       |service| handles {+clusters+} that exceed the operations per second
       rate limit as follows:

       - |service| throttles the network speed of the cluster.
       - |service| triggers a one second cooldown period before resuming
         the cluster's operations on a given connection. If the queue is
         greater than the operations per second limit, operations might
         wait for more than a second in the queue.
       - If the number of operations per second drops below the rate limit
         threshold, |service| resumes processing of the queued operations
         on each connection before processing any new operations on that
         connection.

   * - Automatic Pause of Idle Clusters
     - |service| automatically pauses ``M0`` {+Free-clusters+} after
       60 days of inactivity where there are zero connections to the
       cluster.
