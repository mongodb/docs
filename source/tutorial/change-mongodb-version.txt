Overview

For |mms| managed MongoDB, |mms| supports safe automatic upgrade and
downgrade operations between releases of MongoDB while maximizing the
availability of your deployment. |mms| supports upgrade and downgrade
operations for :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`,
:term:`replica sets <replica set>`, and :term:`standalone MongoDB
instances <standalone>`.

:doc:`/tutorial/configure-available-mongodb-version` describes how
to choose which versions of MongoDB are available to |mms|.

Considerations
--------------

Before changing a deployment's MongoDB version:

- Consult the following documents for any special considerations or
  application compatibility issues:

  - :manual:`The MongoDB Release Notes </release-notes>`

  - The documentation for your driver.

- Plan the version change during a predefined maintenance window.

- Before changing version on a production environment, change versions on
  a *staging* environment that reproduces your production environment to
  ensure your configuration is compatible with all changes.
