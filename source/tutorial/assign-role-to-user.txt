====================
Assign a User a Role
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

Overview
--------

A role provides a user privileges to perform a set of :ref:`actions
<security-user-actions>` on a :ref:`resource <resource-document>`. A
user can have multiple roles.

In MongoDB systems with :setting:`~security.authorization` enforced, you must grant a user a
role for the user to access a database resource. To assign a role, first
determine the privileges the user needs and then determine the role that
grants those privileges.

For an overview of roles and privileges, see :ref:`authorization`.
For descriptions of the access each built-in role provides, see
the section on :ref:`built-in roles <built-in-roles>`.
