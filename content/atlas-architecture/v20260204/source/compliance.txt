.. _arch-center-resource-policies:

{+arps+} 
-----------------------

To support your compliance requirements, {+arps+} offer 
organization-wide controls for configuring and managing {+service+} resources in 
alignment with your security, compliance, and operational best practices. Organization 
Owners can define rules that govern user actions when creating or modifying resources 
such as clusters, network configurations, and project settings. We 
recommend that you set a resource policy according to your company's 
standards at Organization creation time.

{+arps+} support your compliance objectives by enabling you to:

- **Enforce Minimum TLS Version:** Mandate the use of modern |tls| protocols across 
  all {+service+} deployments, enhancing security and mitigating risks associated with 
  older, less secure versions. This ensures adherence to contemporary encryption 
  standards for all data in transit.

- **Customize Default TLS Ciphers:** Select a specific set of allowed |tls| ciphers 
  to optimize security based on operational needs while avoiding 
  vulnerabilities associated with legacy encryption methods. This allows for fine-tuning 
  encryption protocols to meet specific compliance requirements.

- **Restrict VPC Peering Modifications:** Enable secure cross-network communication 
  through established |vpc| peering connections while preventing configuration changes. 
  Current project-level peerings remain active with their existing routing tables 
  and security protocols, allowing customers to view but not alter these one-to-one 
  |vpc| relationships and their associated network control mechanisms.

- **Restrict Private Endpoint Modifications:** Maintain secure service connectivity 
  through existing private endpoint configurations with read-only access. Project-level 
  connections remain functional with their current private IP addressing scheme, while 
  customers can view but not modify these dedicated service connection points within 
  their |vpc|.

- **Control IP Access Lists:** Prevent unauthorized modifications to IP access lists, 
  supporting consistent and controlled network access to your databases. This strengthens 
  database security by preserving carefully defined network boundaries and protecting 
  against accidental configuration changes.

- **Set Cluster Tier Limits:** Define deployment guardrails by establishing both 
  maximum and minimum cluster size limits that developers must adhere to when 
  provisioning resources. This boundary-setting approach ensures teams can deploy 
  appropriately sized environments within organization-approved parameters, optimizing 
  infrastructure utilization while enforcing consistent resource allocation policies 
  across all project workloads.

- **Set Maintenance Window Requirement:** Enhance platform stability by 
  requiring a maintenance window for all projects. This governance 
  control allows organizations to establish a predictable update period 
  (without dictating a specific timeframe) to support consistent system 
  maintenance according to operational needs.

- **Set Cloud Provider and Regions:** Set your cloud provider and 
  distribute clusters across multiple regions and providers to meet 
  your data residency requirements and ensure high availability.

- **Block Usage of the Wildcard IP Address:** Limit access to your 
  cluster to only explicitly permitted IP addresses by not 
  including the wildcard IP address in your IP access list or firewall 
  rules. The wildcard IP address is 0.0.0.0/0 and allows access from 
  anywhere.

To learn more, see :atlas:`Atlas Resource Policies </atlas-resource-policies/>`.

The following resource policy example, allows clusters to be created 
on |aws|:

.. code-block::
   :copyable: true

   {
     "name": "Only Allow Clusters on AWS",
     "policies": [
       {
         "body": "forbid ( principal, action == cloud::Action::\"cluster.createEdit\", resource) unless { context.cluster.cloudProviders   == [cloud::cloudProvider::\"aws\"] };"
       }
     ]
   }

The following example creates a Terraform resource policies file you 
can use to enforce resource policies in your application. The file 
enforces the following policies:

- Restricts cluster modification to only a specified cloud provider.
- Forbids cluster access from a wildcard IP address.
- Specifies a minimum and maximum cluster size.
- Prevents modification to private endpoints.

.. _arch-center-compliance-encryption:

Encryption
----------

You can implement encryption to amplify data security across all
stages of data handling. Encryption is one of the most common 
requirements for ensuring compliance with industry security standards, 
and {+service+} offers a robust set of encryption options to satisfy 
the requirements.

- By default, |service| encrypts data in transit. |service| requires 
  |tls-ssl| to encrypt the connections to your databases.

- By default, |service| encrypts all data at rest using 
  `cloud provider disk encryption <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security-kms-encryption/>`__. When using {+service+} cloud backups,
  |service| uses |AES-256|
  encryption to encrypt all data stored in |s3| buckets in your |service|
  {+database-deployments+}.
  In addition, |service| supports using |aws| |kms|, |akv|, and |gcp| to
  encrypt storage engines and cloud provider backups. To learn more, see
  :atlas:`Encryption at Rest using your Key Management 
  </security-kms-encryption>`. 

- You can use :manual:`Queryable Encryption 
  </core/queryable-encryption/>` to secure queries on encrypted data on 
  a select set of sensitive fields in a document stored on MongoDB. 
  With Queryable Encryption, sensitive information remains protected 
  even when users run queries on data.

  Use  well-researched non-deterministic encryption schemes to maintain
  a balance between security and functionality.

  With {+qe+}, you can perform the following tasks:

  - Encrypt sensitive data fields from the client-side.
  - Store sensitive data fields as fully randomized encrypted data on the database 
    {+cluster+}-side, run with {+service+}.
  - Run expressive queries on the encrypted data.

  MongoDB completes these tasks without the server having knowledge of the data
  it's processing.

  When using Queryable Encryption, sensitive data is encrypted throughout its 
  lifecycle: in transit, at rest, in use,
  in logs, and backups. The data is only ever decrypted on the client-side,
  since only you have access to the encryption keys.

  You can set up {+qe+} using the following mechanisms:

  - :manual:`Automatic Encryption </core/queryable-encryption/>`
    enables you to perform encrypted read and write operations without
    having to add explicit calls to encrypt and decrypt fields. We recommend automatic encryption in most situations, as it streamlines the process of writing your client application. With automatic encryption, MongoDB automatically encrypts and decrypts fields in read and write operations.
  - :manual:`Explicit Encryption </core/queryable-encryption/fundamentals/manual-encryption/>` enables
    you to perform encrypted read and write operations through your MongoDB
    client library's encryption library. You must specify the logic for encryption
    with this library throughout your application. Explicit encryption provides fine-grained control over security, at the cost of increased complexity when configuring collections and writing code for MongoDB Client Libraries. With explicit encryption, you specify how to encrypt fields in your document for each operation you perform on the database, and you include this logic throughout your application.

    To learn more, see :manual:`Use Explicit Encryption </core/queryable-encryption/tutorials/explicit-encryption/>`.

.. _arch-center-compliance-data-sovereignty:

Data Regionalization
--------------------

{+service+} supports over 110+ regions across |aws|, |azure|, and 
|gcp|. This global distribution of supported locations allows you to 
provision clusters and store data that complies with your data 
localization requirements. You can also deploy your |service| clusters 
across multiple regions. When you deploy a 
:ref:`multi-region deployment paradigm 
<arch-center-paradigms-multi-region>`, you can partition your data to 
reside in distinct regions, each situated in a different geographical 
region. For example, you can store European customer data in Europe 
and U.S. customer data in the U.S. This allows you flexibility in your 
data localization choice, and reduces latency for users accessing data 
from their respective regions.

.. _arch-center-compliance-backup-distribution:

Backup Snapshot Distribution
----------------------------

You can distribute backup snapshots and oplog data across multiple 
regions. For example, you can satisfy store backups in
different geographical locations to enable disaster recovery
in case of regional outages, or to maintain backups consistently with 
your data localization choices. To learn more, see 
:atlas:`Snapshot Distribution 
</backup/cloud-backup/snapshot-distribution/>`.

.. _arch-center-compliance-backup-compliance-policy:

Backup Compliance Policy
------------------------

You can use |bcp| in {+service+} to secure business-critical data. This 
feature prevents all backup snapshots and oplog data stored in 
{+service+} from being modified or deleted for a predefined retention 
period by any user, regardless of their {+service+} role.

This helps you guarantee that your backups are fully WORM (Write Once Read Many)-compliant.
Only a designated, authorized
user can turn off this protection after completing a verification
process with MongoDB support. This adds a mandatory manual 
delay and cooldown period so that an attacker cannot easily change the 
backup policy and export the data. To learn more, see 
:atlas:`Configure a Backup Compliance Policy 
</backup/cloud-backup/backup-compliance-policy/>`.
