.. _4.0-remove-mongodb-cr:

Remove Support for ``MONGODB-CR``
---------------------------------

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB removes support for the deprecated
MongoDB Challenge-Response (``MONGODB-CR``) authentication mechanism.

Since version 3.0, MongoDB has not supported the creation of
``MONGODB-CR`` users unless the deployment had been upgraded from a 2.6
or earlier deployment that already had ``MONGODB-CR`` users and had not
upgraded the authentication schema.

If your deployment has user credentials stored in ``MONGODB-CR``
schema, you must upgrade to :ref:`Salted Challenge Response
Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) <authentication-scram>` **before** you
upgrade to version 4.0. For information on upgrading to ``SCRAM``, see
:doc:`/release-notes/3.0-scram`.

.. _4.0-remove-authschemaupgrade:

Removal of ``authSchemaUpgrade`` Command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 4.0 removes the ``authSchemaUpgrade`` command . The command,
available in MongoDB 3.0 through MongoDB 3.6, supports the upgrade
process for systems with ``MONGDB-CR`` users to ``SCRAM`` users.

If your deployment has user credentials stored in ``MONGODB-CR``
schema, you must upgrade to :ref:`Salted Challenge Response
Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) <authentication-scram>` **before** you
upgrade to version 4.0. For information on upgrading to ``SCRAM``, see
:doc:`/release-notes/3.0-scram`.

.. _4.0-remove-mongodb-cr-copydb:

Remove ``MONGODB-CR`` Support from ``db.copyDatabase()`` and ``copydb``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The method :method:`db.copyDatabase()` cannot copy from a
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that enforces ``MONGODB-CR``
authentication.

The command :dbcommand:`copydb` cannot copy from a
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance that enforces ``MONGODB-CR``
authentication. In conjunction with this change, MongoDB 4.0 removes
the ``copydbgetnonce`` command.

Deprecate MMAPv1
----------------

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB deprecates the :ref:`storage-mmapv1`.

To change your MMAPv1 storage engine deployment to
:doc:`/core/wiredtiger`, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/change-standalone-wiredtiger`

- :doc:`/tutorial/change-replica-set-wiredtiger`

- :doc:`/tutorial/change-sharded-cluster-wiredtiger`

Remove Master-Slave Replication
-------------------------------

MongoDB 4.0 removes support for the deprecated master-slave
replication. Before you can upgrade to MongoDB 4.0, if your deployment
uses master-slave replication, you must upgrade to a replica set.

To convert your master-slave replication, see
:ref:`convert-master-slave-to-replica-set`.

General
-------

- Remove ``mongoperf``.
