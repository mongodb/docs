title: Add a query filter.

  You can see now that higher-rated movies have a higher density of
  awards, but the chart is rather noisy. Add a query filter to only
  include movies with at least 30 award nominations and marginal MPAA ratings.
  
  a. In the :guilabel:`Filters` box, add the
     following query filter and click the :guilabel:`Apply` button:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        {"awards.nominations": {$gte: 30}, rated: {$in: ["G", "PG", "PG-13", "R"]}}

title: Differentiate the chart by MPAA rating.

  In the :guilabel:`Fields` section, drag the ``rated`` field
  to the :guilabel:`Color` :ref:`encoding channel <encoding-channels>`.

  .. example:: Additional Data Options

     There are three options for adding more data to your chart. You
     can use any of your data fields to modify the size, color, and
     shape of the markers on the grid. The ``rated`` field works well
     here because it has low cardinality; there are only four possible
     values (``G``, ``PG``, ``PG-13``, and ``R``). Fields with higher
     cardinality may make the chart too noisy to read.

      .. figure:: /images/charts/tutorial2-most-awards-by-rating.png

         :alt: Movies with the most awards by rating

   #. Click :guilabel:`Save and Close` to return to your
      dashboard.
