Starting with {+c2c-version+} and {+c2c-version-7+}, |service| supports
verifying the data migrated from the source {+cluster+} to the destination
{+cluster+}. The verification process in |service| runs a series of checks
to confirm that the data sync during the live migration process is successful.
These checks include |service| comparing supported documents
and collections.

Before transferring your application's data to the destination {+cluster+},
always verify that a migration is successful. You can enable verification
in the live migration {+atlas-ui+}, or verify the data manually.

The verification process that runs at the end of the |service| live migration
process is optional. We highly recommend that you enable it in the live migration's
{+atlas-ui+} and request that |service| runs the data sync verification process
before you cut over to the destination {+cluster+} in |service|.

List of Verifications
---------------------

As part of the verification process that you can enable in the {+atlas-ui+}
for live migration, |service| performs the following checks on the source and
destination {+clusters+}:

- The phase and progress of verification checks running on the {+cluster+}.
- The estimated number of documents on the {+cluster+}.
- The number of documents hashed by the verifier process on the {+cluster+}.
- The number of collections scanned by the verifier process on the {+cluster+}.
- The number of collections on the {+cluster+} to include in verification checks.

If the verification process finds errors, this fails the live migration.

Enable Verification in the {+atlas-ui+}
-----------------------------------------

You can enable verification as part of the live migration process
configuration in the {+atlas-ui+}. For exact steps, see :ref:`c2c-pull-live-migration`.

.. important::

   If you enable verification in the {+atlas-ui+}, and |service| finds any
   inconsistencies during verification checks, the live migration fails.
   The verification process **DOES NOT** check for all possible data
   inconsistencies. Review :ref:`limitations <verify-migrations-limitations>`
   in this documentation to see what data the verification process does not
   support and manually verify this data.

Verify Data Manually
--------------------

If you disable automated verification in the live migration {+atlas-ui+},
you can create scripts for manual verification of the migrated data and
use an alternative manual verification method to verify that your data is
migrated successfully. To learn more about the alternative methods,
see |c2c-verification|.

.. _verify-migrations-limitations:

Limitations
-----------

The verification process in live migration has the following limitations:

- Verification is not available in versions earlier than {+c2c-version+}.
- Verification of sharded clusters is unsupported.
- Verification runs on live migration (pull) and is not supported on live migration (push).
- You can't resume a verification process. If you stop or pause the live
  migration process and then restart it, the verification process starts
  from the beginning.
- The verification process doesn't check:

  - Sharded collections
  - Capped collections
  - Collections with TTL indexes
  - Collections that don't use the default collation
  - Views
  - Collection metadata
  - Indexes

To ensure a successful live migration and verify data for unsupported
collections, indexes, and metadata, you can use one of the verification
methods described in |c2c-verification|.
