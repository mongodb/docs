===================
$last (aggregation)
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

.. group:: $last

   Returns the last value it encounters for its group.

   .. note::

      Only use :group:`$last` when the :pipeline:`$group`
      follows an :pipeline:`$sort` operation. Otherwise, the
      result of this operation is unpredictable.
