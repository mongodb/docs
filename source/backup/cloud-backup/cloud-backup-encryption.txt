|service| encrypts all snapshots using your cloud provider's standard
storage encryption method, ensuring the security of cluster data at
rest. Your cloud provider manages the encryption keys. For projects and
clusters using :ref:`security-kms-encryption`, |service| applies an
additional layer of encryption to your snapshots using
the Key Management Service (KMS) provider configured for the cluster.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      :tabid: aws-kms

      For clusters using :doc:`AWS IAM </security-aws-kms>` as their
      Key Management Service, |service| uses the project's customer
      master key (CMK) and AWS |iam| user or role credentials at the time
      of the snapshot to automatically encrypt the snapshot data files.
      This is an additional layer of encryption on the existing
      encryption applied to all |service| storage and snapshot
      volumes. :term:`Oplog <oplog>` data collected for |pit| restores
      is also encrypted with the customer's |cmk|.

      |service| stores the unique ID of the |cmk| and the |aws| |iam|
      user credentials or :ref:`roles <set-up-unified-aws-access>` used
      to access the |cmk|. |service| uses this information when restoring
      the snapshot. For complete documentation on restoring an encrypted
      snapshot, see :ref:`restore-encrypted-snapshot`.

   .. tab:: Azure Key Vault
      :tabid: azure-kms

      For clusters using :doc:`Azure Key Vault </security-azure-kms>`
      as their Key Management Service, |service| uses the project's
      Key Identifier, Key Vault Credentials, and Active Directory
      application account credentials at the time of the snapshot to
      automatically encrypt the snapshot data files. This is an
      additional layer of encryption on the existing encryption
      applied to all |service| storage and snapshot volumes.

      |service| stores the unique ID of the Azure Key Identifier used
      the encrypt the snapshot. |service| also stores the Azure Key
      Vault credentials and the Active Domain application account
      credentials used to access the Key Identifier. |service| uses
      this information when restoring the snapshot. For complete
      documentation on restoring an encrypted snapshot, see
      :ref:`restore-encrypted-snapshot`.

   .. tab:: Google Cloud KMS
      :tabid: gcp-kms

      |service| uses your |gcp| Service Account Key to encrypt and
      decrypt your MongoDB master keys. These MongoDB master keys are
      used to encrypt cluster database files and :ref:`cloud providers
      snapshots <backup-cloud-provider>`. For complete documentation
      on restoring an encrypted snapshot, see
      :ref:`restore-encrypted-snapshot`.

To view the key used to encrypt a snapshot:

1. Click :guilabel:`Databases` in the top-left corner of the 
   {atlas-ui+}.
   
#. From the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view of the 
   {+atlas-ui+}, click the cluster name.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then click
   :guilabel:`Snapshots`.

#. Note the :guilabel:`Encryption Key ID` for each snapshot in
   the cluster. |service| lists the Key Identifier
   used to encrypt the snapshot. Unencrypted snapshots display
   :guilabel:`Not enabled`.

For complete documentation on configuring Encryption at Rest using
your Key Management for an |service| project,
see :doc:`/security-kms-encryption`. You can then either
:ref:`deploy <create-cluster-enable-encryption>` a new cluster or
:ref:`enable <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>` an existing cluster
with Encryption at Rest using your Key Management.
