Overview
--------

This page details system configurations that affect MongoDB,
especially in production.

Backups
-------

To make backups of your MongoDB database, please refer to the
:ref:`backups section <backup-overview>`.

Networking
----------

Always run MongoDB in a *trusted environment*, with network rules that
prevent access from *all* unknown machines, systems, or networks. As
with any sensitive system dependent on network access, your MongoDB
deployment should only be accessible to specific systems that require
access: application servers, monitoring services, and other MongoDB
components.

See documents in the :doc:`/security` section for additional
information, specifically:

- :ref:`security-port-numbers`
- :ref:`security-firewalls`
- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-linux-iptables-firewall`
- :doc:`/tutorial/configure-windows-netsh-firewall`

MongoDB on Linux
----------------

If you use the Linux kernel, the MongoDB user community has
recommended Linux kernel 2.6.36 or later for running MongoDB in
production.

Because MongoDB preallocates its database files before using them and
because MongoDB uses very large files on average, your should
use the Ext4 and XFS file systems if using the Linux kernel:

- If you use the Ext4 file system, use at least version 2.6.23 of the
  Linux Kernel.

- If you use the XFS file system, use at least version 2.6.25 of the
  Linux Kernel.

For MongoDB on Linux use the following recommended configurations:

- Turn off ``atime`` for the storage volume with the :term:`database
  files <dbpath>`.

- Set file descriptor limit and user process limit to 20,000,
  according to the suggestions in :doc:`/administration/ulimit`. A low
  ulimit will affect MongoDB when under heavy use and will produce
  weird errors.

- Do not use ``hugepages`` virtual memory pages, MongoDB performs
  better with normal virtual memory pages.

- Disable NUMA in your BIOS. If that is not possible see :ref:`NUMA
  <production-numa>`.

- Ensure that readahead settings for the block devices that store the
  database files are acceptable. See the :ref:`Readahead
  <production-readahead>` section

- Use NTP to synchronize time between your hosts. This is especially
  important in sharded clusters.

.. _production-readahead:

Readahead
---------

For random access use patterns set readahead values low, for example
setting readahead to a small value such as 32 (16KB) often works well.

MongoDB on Virtual Environments
-------------------------------

The section describes considerations when running MongoDB in some of the
more common virtual environments.

EC2
~~~

MongoDB is compatible with EC2 and requires no configuration changes
specific to the environment.

VMWare
~~~~~~

MongoDB is compatible with VMWare. Some in the MongoDB community have
run into issues with the VMWare's memory overcommit feature and suggest
disabling the feature.

You can clone a virtual machine running MongoDB. You might use this to
spin up a new virtual host that will be added as a member of a replica
set. If Journaling is enabled, the clone snapshot will be consistent. If
not using journaling, stop :program:`mongod`, clone, and then restart.

OpenVZ
~~~~~~

The MongoDB community has encountered issues running MongoDB on OpenVZ.

Disk and Storage Systems
------------------------

Swap
~~~~

Configure swap space for your systems. Having swap can prevent issues
with memory contention and can prevent the OOM Killer on Linux systems
from killing :program:`mongod`. Because of the way :program:`mongod`
maps memory files to memory, the operating system will never store
MongoDB data in swap.

RAID
~~~~

Most MongoDB deployments should use disks backed by RAID-10.

RAID-5 and RAID-6 do not typically provide sufficient performance to
support a MongoDB deployment.

RAID-0 provides good write performance but provides limited
availability, and reduced performance on read operations, particularly
using Amazon's EBS volumes: as a result, avoid RAID-0 with MongoDB
deployments.

Remote Filesystem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some versions of NFS perform very poorly with MongoDB and are not
recommended for use with MongoDB.

Many MongoDB deployments work successfully with Amazon's *Elastic
Block Store* (EBS) volumes. There are certain intrinsic performance
characteristics, with EBS volumes that users should consider.

Hardware Requirements and Limitations
-------------------------------------

MongoDB is designed specifically with commodity hardware in mind and
has few hardware requirements or limitations. MongoDB core components
runs on little-endian hardware primarily x86/x86_64 processors. Client
libraries (i.e. drivers) can run on big or little endian systems.

When installing hardware for MongoDB, consider the following:

- As with all software, more RAM and a faster CPU clock speed are
  important to productivity.

- Because databases do not perform high amounts of computation,
  increasing the number cores helps but does not provide a high level of
  marginal return.

- MongoDB has good results and good price/performance with SATA SSD
  (Solid State Disk) and with PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect).

- Commodity (SATA) spinning drives are often a good option as the
  speed increase for random I/O for more expensive drives is not that
  dramatic (only on the order of 2x), spending that money on SSDs or
  RAM may be more effective.

.. _production-numa:

MongoDB on NUMA Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB and NUMA, Non-Uniform Access Memory, do not work well
together. When running MongoDB on NUMA hardware, disable NUMA for
MongoDB and running with an interleave memory policy. NUMA can cause a
number of operational problems with MongoDB, including slow
performance for periods of time or high system processor usage.

.. note::

   On Linux, MongoDB version 2.0 and greater checks these
   settings on start up and prints a warning if the system is
   NUMA-based.

To disable NUMA for MongoDB, use the ``numactl`` command and start
:program:`mongod` in the following manner:

.. code-block:: sh

   numactl --interleave=all /usr/bin/local/mongod

Adjust the ``proc`` settings using the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode

To fully disable NUMA you must perform both operations. However, can
change ``zone_reclaim_mode`` without restarting mongod. For more
information, see documentation on `Proc/sys/vm
<http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt>`_.

See the `The MySQL “swap insanity” problem and the effects of NUMA
<http://jcole.us/blog/archives/2010/09/28/mysql-swap-insanity-and-the-numa-architecture/>`_
post, which describes the effects of NUMA on databases. This blog post
addresses the impact of NUMA for MySQL; however, the issues for
MongoDB are similar. The post introduces NUMA its goals, and
illustrates how these goals are not compatible with production
databases.

Performance Monitoring
----------------------

iostat
~~~~~~

On Linux, use the iostat command to check if disk I/O is a bottleneck
for your database. Specify a number of seconds when running iostat to
avoid displaying stats covering the time since server boot.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   iostat -xm 2

Use the mount command to see what device your :setting:`data directory
<dbpath>` resides on.

Key fields from ``iostat``:

- ``%util``: this is the most useful field for a quick check, it
  indicates what percent of the time the device/drive is in use.

- ``avgrq-sz``: average request size. Smaller number for this value
  reflect more random IO operations.
