  In :guilabel:`Alert if`, select the target component. If you select
  ``Host``, you must also select the type of host.

  Next, select the condition and, if applicable, specify the threshold for
  the metric. For explanations of alert conditions and metrics, see
  :doc:`/reference/alerts`.

  In :guilabel:`For`, you can optionally filter the alert to apply only to
  a subset of the monitored targets. This option is available only if the
  targets are hosts or replica sets.
