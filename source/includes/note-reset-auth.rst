If at any point you wish to reset the authentication settings for your
group and start again, you can use the :guilabel:`Clear Settings` button
in the :guilabel:`Authentication & SSL Settings` window to clear all
authentication and security settings, automation users, and automation roles.
You **cannot** clear the authentication and security settings if there
are managed processes in your deployment. See: :doc:`/tutorial/clear-security-settings`
for more information.
