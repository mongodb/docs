pre: |
  Change to the directory containing the ``.msi`` installation binary of your
  choice and invoke:

  .. include:: {{release_specification_default}}

  You can specify the installation location for the executable by
  modifying the ``INSTALLLOCATION`` value.

  By default, this method installs all MongoDB binaries. To install specific
  MongoDB component sets, you can specify them in the ``ADDLOCAL`` argument
  using a comma-separated list including one or more of the following
  component sets:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 80

     * - Component Set
       - Binaries
     * - ``Server``
       - ``mongod.exe``
     * - ``Router``
       - ``mongos.exe``
     * - ``Client``
       - ``mongo.exe``
     * - ``MonitoringTools``
       - ``mongostat.exe``, ``mongotop.exe``
     * - ``ImportExportTools``
       - ``mongodump.exe``, ``mongorestore.exe``, ``mongoexport.exe``, ``mongoimport.exe``
     * - ``MiscellaneousTools``
       - ``bsondump.exe``, ``mongofiles.exe``

  For instance, to install *only* the MongoDB utilities, invoke:

  .. include:: {{release_specification_addlocal}}

  If you do NOT wish to install :ref:`MongoDB Compass <compass-index>`
  at this time, include the ``SHOULD_INSTALL_COMPASS="0"`` argument.

  .. include:: {{release_specification_nocompass}}

replacement:
  release_specification_default: "/includes/release/install-windows-default.rst"
  release_specification_addlocal: "/includes/release/install-windows-addlocal.rst"
  release_specification_nocompass: "/includes/release/install-windows-nocompass.rst"
