   Specify the fields on which chart viewers can filter data. By
   default, no fields are whitelisted, meaning the chart cannot be
   filtered until you explicitly whitelist at least one field.

   To learn more about filterable fields, see
   :ref:`specify-filter-fields`.

title: Decide whether you want to embed your chart using an iframe
   or the SDK.
ref: iframe-or-sdk

   You can choose to embed your chart using an iframe or the Charts
   Embedding SDK. The iframe provides a simpler cut-and-paste method
   to embed your chart, whereas the Embedding SDK provides a more
   programmatic approach.

             a. You can customize a variety of chart properties, such as
                theme and refresh behavior.

                For detailed information on the available customization
                options for your embedded chart, see
                :ref:`embedded-chart-options`.

             b. Copy the :guilabel:`Embed Code` at the bottom of the
                dialog.
             
                The :guilabel:`Embed Code` contains an ``iframe`` which
                you can embed in your application. If you specified any
                customization options, the embed code updates to include
                those options.

        - id: sdk
          name: SDK

             a. Copy the :guilabel:`Chart ID` and
                :guilabel:`Chart Base URL`.

                Use these values in your application code together with
                your Embedded Authentication Provider attributes to
                embed your chart.

                For code examples for each Embedded Authentication
                Provider, see the `SDK Samples GitHub Repository
                <https://github.com/mongodb-js/charts-embed-sdk/>`__.
