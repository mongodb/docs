   |mms|: 

   - Uses your :guilabel:`System Log Rotation` settings to rotate both the
     server logs and the audit logs. 
   - Doesn't compress or delete audit logs. If you configure compression and
     deletion, |mms| applies these settings to the server logs only.

   MongoDB Community users can rotate, compress, and delete the server logs only.
