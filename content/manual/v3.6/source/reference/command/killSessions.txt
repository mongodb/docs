.. dbcommand:: killSessions

   .. versionadded:: 3.6

   The :dbcommand:`killSessions` command kills the specified sessions.
   If access control is enabled, the command only kills the sessions
   owned by the user.


   .. note::

      Killing a session also kills any in-progress operations in the
      session and closes any open cursors associated with these
      operations.

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { killSessions: [ { id : <UUID> }, ... ] } )

The command takes an array of documents that specify the UUID portion
of the session id. Specify an empty array ``[ ]`` to kill all sessions,
or if access control is enabled, all sessions owned by the user.

To view existing sessions, see :pipeline:`$listSessions` operation or
:pipeline:`$listLocalSessions`.

.. |command| replace:: :dbcommand:`killSessions`

Behavior
--------

Session Identification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB concatenates each of the specified UUIDs with the hash of the
authenticated user credentials to identify the user's sessions to kill.
If the user has no session that match, the :dbcommand:`killSessions`
has no effect.


Example
-------

The following operation kills the specified session for the user:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { killSessions: [ { id: UUID("f9b3d8d9-9496-4fff-868f-04a6196fc58a") } ] } )
