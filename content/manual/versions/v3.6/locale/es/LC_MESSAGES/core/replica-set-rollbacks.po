"A rollback reverts write operations on a former :term:`primary` when the "
"member rejoins its :term:`replica set` after a :term:`failover`. A "
"rollback is necessary only if the primary had accepted write operations "
"that the :term:`secondaries <secondary>` had **not** successfully "
"replicated before the primary stepped down. When the primary rejoins the "
"set as a secondary, it reverts, or \"rolls back,\" its write operations "
