Configure a {+bcp+}

   :description: Configure a Backup Compliance Policy using Atlas Kubernetes Operator to protect backup data, with strict requirements and limitations on actions.

If you have strict data protection requirements, you can use |ak8so| to 
enable a :ref:`{+bcp+} <backup-compliance-policy>` to protect your 
backup data.

.. _ak8so-bcp-prohibited-actions:

Prohibited Actions
------------------

If you enable a {+bcp+}, no user, regardless of role, can do certain 
actions. Carefully review the :ref:`prohibited actions 
<bcp-prohibited-actions>`.

.. important::

   If you set this parameter to ``true``, |service| upgrades all 
   backup policies in the project regardless of what is specified in 
   the :ref:`atlasbackuppolicy-custom-resource`. |service| overrides 
   the :ref:`atlasbackuppolicy-custom-resource` and the status 
   of that custom resource updates to ``Ready: False``. You must 
   manually update the :ref:`atlasbackuppolicy-custom-resource` to 
   align with the {+bcp+}.

   If you set this parameter to ``false``, creating the {+bcp+} fails 
   if the existing backup policies do not satisfy the {+bcp+}.

.. _ak8so-bcp-considerations:

Considerations
--------------

After you enable a {+bcp+}, certain behaviors apply. Carefully 
review the :ref:`considerations <bcp-considerations>`.

Required Access
---------------

To configure a {+bcp+}, you must have :authrole:`Project Owner` access 
to the project. Users with :authrole:`Organization Owner` access must 
add themselves as a ``Project Owner`` to the project before configuring 
a {+bcp+}.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Only MongoDB Support can do the following actions:
 
  - Disable the {+bcp+}.
   
  - Disable :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} <create-cluster-backups>` if the 
    {+bcp+} has the 
    :guilabel:`Require Point in Time Restore to all clusters` option 
    set to :guilabel:`On`.

  - Reduce the :ref:`{+PIT-Restore+} Restore Window 
    <create-pit-policy>`.

  - Delete :ref:`policy items <creating-backup-policy>` specified in 
    the {+bcp+}.
    
- Only the specified security or legal representative can 
  :ref:`request support <request-support>`.

- You can apply a {+bcp+} to ``M10+`` {+dedicated-clusters+} only.

  .. note::

     You can't convert a {+dedicated-cluster+} to an ``M0`` 
     {+Free-cluster+}, an ``M2`` or ``M5`` {+Shared-cluster+}, a 
     {+Flex-cluster+}, or a {+Serverless-instance+}.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create the {+bcp+}.

      To learn more about the parameters for a {+bcp+}, see the 
      :ref:`bcp-custom-resource`.

      **Example:**

      .. code-block:: sh

         cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
         apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
         kind: AtlasBackupCompliancePolicy
         metadata:
           name: my-backup-compliance-policy
           namespace: mongdb-atlas-system
         spec:
           authorizedEmail: john.doe@example.com
           authorizedUserFirstName: John
           authorizedUserLastName: Doe
           copyProtectionEnabled: false
           encryptionAtRestEnabled: false
           onDemandPolicy:
             retentionUnit: weeks
             retentionValue: 3
           overwriteBackupPolicies: false
           pointInTimeEnabled: true
           restoreWindowDays: 42
           scheduledPolicyItems:
           - frequencyInterval: 2
             frequencyType: daily
             retentionUnit: days
             retentionValue: 7
         EOF

      .. note::

         This {+bcp+} applies as the minimum backup policy to all 
         {+clusters+} in the project. The {+bcp+} protects all 
         existing snapshots. The {+bcp+} prevents any user, 
         regardless of role, from modifying or deleting existing 
         snapshots prior to their expiration. Changes made to this 
         {+bcp+} apply only to future snapshots. If you enable a 
         {+bcp+}, the {+bcp+} limits your ability to reduce backup 
         storage costs. You can't adjust the retention or delete a 
         backup to reduce the backup storage costs.

   .. step:: Apply the {+bcp+} to the project.

      In the :setting:`spec.backupCompliancePolicyRef` parameter in the 
      :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`, specify the name and 
      namespace of the opaque |k8s-secret| that references the 
      :ref:`bcp-custom-resource`.

      **Example:**

      .. code-block:: sh

         cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
         apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
         kind: AtlasProject
         metadata:
           name: my-project
         spec:
           backupCompliancePolicyRef:
             name: my-backup-compliance-policy
             namespace: mongodb-atlas-system
         EOF
