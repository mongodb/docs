   :description: Learn how to embed charts and dashboards using iFrame or JavaScript SDK with options for authenticated or unauthenticated access.

.. default-domain:: mongodb

|charts-short| offers a :guilabel:`Getting Started` UI to help you 
learn how to embed :ref:`charts <embedding-charts>` and 
:ref:`dashboards <embedding-dashboards>` with an iFrame or Javascript 
SDK. You can use authenticated or unauthenticated embedding to view
charts and dashboards generated from your environment.

Authenticated embedding allows you to perform the following actions to
your charts and dashboards:

- Control user access
- :ref:`Injected filtering <embedded-chart-options>`
- :ref:`Google and JWT authentication <configure-auth-providers>`

Unauthenticated embedding allows you to perform the following actions to
your charts and dashboards: 

- Allow everyone with the chart or dashboard link to have view access
- Specify the following options:

  - Maximum data range
  - Auto-refresh
  - Color theme, width, and height
  - Whether to display the title and description

.. tip::
   
   If you use the :ref:`Embedding SDK <embedding-charts-sdk>`, you can
   make more flexible adjustments to dashboard settings and rendering
   specifications such as styling and branding. To learn more, see 
   :ref:`charts-embedding-sdk`.

Prerequisites
-------------

- You must be a chart or dashboard :ref:`Author <dashboard-permissions>`
  to enable embedding for a chart or dashboard.
- Access to the :ref:`data source <data-sources>`.
