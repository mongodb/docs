title: Obtain backup MongoDB Database files.
stepnum: 1
ref: obtain-backup-files
content: |
  
  The backup files may come from a :doc:`file system snapshot
  </tutorial/backup-with-filesystem-snapshots>`. The |mms-home|
  produces MongoDB database files for :mms-docs:`stored snapshots
  </tutorial/restore-from-snapshot/>` and :mms-docs:`point in time
  snapshots </tutorial/restore-from-point-in-time-snapshot/>`.
  For :products:`Ops Manager, an on-premise solution available in
  MongoDB Enterprise Advanced </mongodb-enterprise-advanced?jmp=docs>`,
  see also the :opsmgr:`Ops Manager Backup overview </core/backup-overview>`.

  You
  can also use :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` to restore database files using
  data created with :binary:`~bin.mongodump`. See
  :doc:`/tutorial/backup-and-restore-tools` for more information.
