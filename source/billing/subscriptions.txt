A MongoDB subscription offers flexible payment terms and advanced 
support options. Subscriptions allow for billing in different 
currencies, billing in arrears, billing monthly or for annual invoicing 
with |ach| payments or wire transfers. Subscriptions provide 
order forms [#order-form]_ and an 
Enterprise Customer Service Agreement (CSA).

   * - Subscription

   * - Elastic subscription
     - You receive a monthly invoice for your usage.

   * - Prepaid subscription
     - You prepay for credits, usable for a term you define upon 
       subscribing (e.g. annual). 

   * - Monthly Commitment subscription
     - You commit to paying for a number of credits for a 
       term (e.g. annual) and receive a monthly invoice for the greater 
       of your usage or your prorated monthly commitment. Unused 
       credits can be applied at a later date during the term to cover 
       overages.

   * - Marketplace subscription
     - You receive invoices for your |service| usage through 
       the marketplace from which you subscribed.

.. _purchase-subscription:

Purchase a Subscription
-----------------------

To purchase a subscription, contact 
:website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>`.

When you purchase a subscription, you are asked to provide a 
*billing contact* email address. Your billing contact receives invoices.

.. note::
   
   MongoDB recommends inviting your billing contact to your 
   subscription-paying organization.

.. _activate-subscription:

Activate a Subscription
-----------------------

.. note::
   You must be an :authrole:`Organization Owner` 
   or :authrole:`Organization Billing Admin` to activate a subscription.

When you purchase a subscription from
:website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>`,
MongoDB sends you an email containing an activation code.
To apply this subscription to your |service| organization:

.. include:: /includes/steps/billing-apply-credit.rst

With an active subscription, |service| displays a confirmation icon
and message in the :guilabel:`Payment Method` card.

   :figwidth: 100%
   :alt: While your organization has an active subscription, all charges are deducted from your available credits.

.. note::

   - If you do not add your subscription activation code within the
     first 30 days of use, MongoDB charges the credit card associated
     with the account. Credit card charges are non-refundable.

   - If you lose your activation code,
     :ref:`request support <request-support>`.

.. _subscription-level:

View Subscription Charges
-------------------------

The :guilabel:`Summary` section of your invoice lists your total 
monthly subscription cost. The :guilabel:`Details` section lists line 
items.

.. _annual-commitment-invoicing:

Monthly Commitment Subscription Invoicing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your subscription includes a commitment for a term (e.g. annual), 
you can view your month's spending against your commitment in your 
organization's :guilabel:`Billing Overview`.

.. figure:: /images/monthly-commitment.png
   :figwidth: 100%
   :alt: You can view your monthly commitment information at the bottom of your organization's Billing Overview.

At the end of the month, if your usage is lower than your prorated
monthly commitment, you are charged for the prorated commitment. 
Unused credits can be applied at a later date during the term to cover 
overages.

.. _pay-subscription-charges:

Pay Subscription Charges
------------------------

With a subscription, you receive two invoices each month:

- A *cloud invoice* detailing your MongoDB Cloud usage, viewable 
  in |service| on your organizationâ€™s :guilabel:`Billing` page.

- A *tax invoice* emailed to your 
  :ref:`billing contact <purchase-subscription>` with MongoDB bank 
  details and an amount due.

.. note::

   If you purchase a MongoDB subscription from a marketplace, you
   do not receive a tax invoice. Instead, you receive an invoice 
   with an amount due through that marketplace.

Your cloud invoice represents MongoDB Cloud usage in |usd| and does not 
account for currency conversions or other adjustments. The tax invoice 
emailed to your billing contact provides the amount to pay.

If your subscription covers the billing period, pay the invoice emailed 
to your billing contact. If your subscription does not cover the 
billing period, your payment method on file is charged.
