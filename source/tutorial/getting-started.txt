|mms|
-----

|mms| is a service that lets you create, manage, monitor, and back up
MongoDB deployments. You can use |mms| to create new deployments and
monitor existing ones. To monitor existing deployments you download an
|mms| agent to each deployment server.

To use |mms| you create an |mms| :doc:`group </tutorial/create-group>`,
which will provide access to a distinct set of MongoDB processes and
users. You cannot rename the group once created, but you can create
multiple groups.

You can get started with |mms| in minutes by going to
`https://mongodb.com/cloud <https://mongodb.com/cloud>`_ and starting a
free trial. |mms| walks you through registration and the setup of your
first deployment. The choices you make during setup do not limit your
choices for the future.
