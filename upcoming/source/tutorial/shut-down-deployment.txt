|mms| supports shutting down individual |mongod| and |mongos|
processes, as well as :manual:`replica sets </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>` and
:manual:`sharded clusters </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`. When you shut down a
process, cluster, or replica set, |mms| continues to manage it.

After the process shuts down, you can
:doc:`restart </tutorial/restart-processes>` or
:doc:`remove </tutorial/unmanage-deployment>` your processes.

.. note:: No Alert Raised if User Shuts Down a MongoDB Process

   If you shut down a MongoDB process, |mms| doesn't trigger a
   host is down (``HOST_DOWN``) alert.
