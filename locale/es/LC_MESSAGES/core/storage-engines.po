"The :term:`storage engine` is the component of the database that is "
"responsible for managing how data is stored, both in memory and on disk. "
"MongoDB supports multiple storage engines, as different engines perform "
"better for specific workloads. Choosing the appropriate storage engine "
"for your use case can significantly impact the performance of your "
"applications."

":doc:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>` is the default storage engine "
"starting in MongoDB 3.2. It is well-suited for most workloads and is "
"recommended for new deployments. WiredTiger provides a document-level "
"concurrency model, checkpointing, and compression, among other features. "
"In MongoDB Enterprise, WiredTiger also supports :doc:`/core/security-"
"encryption-at-rest`."

":doc:`MMAPv1 </core/mmapv1>` is the original MongoDB storage engine and "
"is the default storage engine for MongoDB versions before 3.2. It "
"performs well on workloads with high volumes of reads and writes, as well"
" as in-place updates."

"The :doc:`In-Memory Storage Engine </core/inmemory>` is available in "
"MongoDB Enterprise. Rather than storing documents on-disk, it retains "
"them in-memory for more predictable data latencies."
