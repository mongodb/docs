.. _atlas-ui-create-a-collection:

Create a Collection
-------------------

.. tip::

   To create the first collection in a new database, see
   :ref:`atlas-ui-create-a-db`.

.. important::

   You cannot create new collections on the ``config`` and
   ``system`` databases. |service| will deprecate writing to existing
   collections on these databases in the near future.

To create a collection in an existing database through the {+atlas-ui+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps-atlas-ui-create-collection.rst

.. _atlas-ui-view-collections:

View Collections
----------------

To view the databases and collections in the deployment:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-data-explorer.rst

      |service| shows the databases in the left pane of the {+atlas-ui+}:

      .. figure:: /images/atlas-ui-dbs-collections.png
         :figwidth: 700px
         :alt: Screenshot of the Collections tab in the Atlas UI.

   .. step:: View the collections in a database.

      Click on the name of the database.

      .. note::

         |service| bases the document count that appears on this tab 
         on cached metadata using :manual:`collStats 
         </reference/command/collStats/>`. This count might differ from 
         the actual document count in the collection. For example, an 
         :manual:`unexpected shutdown 
         </reference/command/collStats/#behavior>` can throw off the 
         count. Use the :manual:`db.collection.countDocuments() 
         </reference/method/db.collection.countDocuments/>` method for 
         the most accurate document count.

.. _atlas-ui-visualize-a-collection:

Visualize Collection Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To launch |charts| to visualize data in your databases and collections.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-data-explorer.rst

   .. step:: Launch |charts|.

      .. include:: includes/fact-charts-activation.rst

.. _atlas-ui-drop-a-collection:

Drop a Collection
-----------------

To drop a collection, including its documents and indexes, through the
{+atlas-ui+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps/atlas-ui-drop-collection.rst

.. _atlas-ui-shard-collection:

Shard a Collection
------------------

If you have large data sets and perform high throughput operations, you 
can :manual:`shard </sharding>` a collection to distribute data across 
the shards. 

.. note:: 

   Before you start, you must have the following: 

   - A :ref:`sharded <create-cluster-sharding>` |service| cluster 
   - {+mongosh+} on your local machine 

To shard a collection through the {+atlas-ui+}:

.. include:: /includes/steps/shard-collection.rst
