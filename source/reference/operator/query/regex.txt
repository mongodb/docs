.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. query:: $regex

   The :query:`$regex` operator provides regular expression
   capabilities for pattern matching *strings* in queries. MongoDB uses Perl compatible regular
   expressions (i.e. "PCRE.")

   You can specify regular expressions using regular expression
   objects or using the :query:`$regex` operator. The following
   examples are equivalent:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: /acme.*corp/i } );
      db.collection.find( { field: { $regex: 'acme.*corp', $options: 'i' } } );

   These expressions match all documents in ``collection`` where the
   value of ``field`` matches the case-insensitive regular expression
   ``acme.*corp``.

   :query:`$regex` uses "Perl Compatible Regular Expressions" (PCRE) as the
   matching engine.

   .. operator:: $options

     :query:`$regex` provides four option flags:

     - ``i`` toggles case insensitivity, and allows all letters in the
       pattern to match upper and lower cases.

     - ``m`` toggles multiline regular expression. Without this option,
       all regular expression match within one line.

       If there are no newline characters (e.g. ``\n``) or no
       start/end of line construct, the ``m`` option has no effect.

     - ``x`` toggles an "extended" capability. When set,
       :query:`$regex` ignores all white space characters unless
       escaped or included in a character class.

       Additionally, it ignores characters between an un-escaped ``#``
       character and the next new line, so that you may include
       comments in complicated patterns. This only applies to data
       characters; white space characters may never appear within
       special character sequences in a pattern.

       The ``x`` option does not affect the handling of the VT character
       (i.e. code 11.)

     .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

     - ``s`` allows the dot (e.g. ``.``) character to match all
       characters *including* newline characters.

     :query:`$regex` only provides the ``i`` and ``m`` options for
     the native JavaScript regular expression objects (e.g. ``/acme.*corp/i``). To use ``x``
     and ``s`` you must use the ":query:`$regex`" operator with the
     ":operator:`$options`" syntax.

   To combine a regular expression match with other operators, you
   need to use the ":query:`$regex`" operator. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { field: { $regex: /acme.*corp/i, $nin: [ 'acmeblahcorp' ] } } );

   This expression returns all instances of ``field`` in
   ``collection`` that match the case insensitive regular expression
   ``acme.*corp`` that *don't* match ``acmeblahcorp``.

   If an index exists for the field, then the regex is matched against the values found in the index.
   This by itself can already be faster than doing a full table scan. But rather than matching against 
   *all* the values of the index, an optimization is to match only against a range of values. This
   optimization is possible if the regex denotes a prefix -- in other words, if all potential matches
   start with the same string. In this case, MongoDB will construct a range from the prefix and only
   try to match against values that fall into this range. A regular expression denotes a prefix if it
   starts with a caret (``^``) or left anchor (``\A``) followed by a string of simple symbols, and is
   case-sensitive. For example, the regex ``/^abc.*/`` will be optimized by matching only against
   values from the index that start with ``abc``.
   
   Additionally, while
   ``/^a/``, ``/^a.*/``, and ``/^a.*$/`` match equivalent strings, they
   have different performance characteristics. All of these expressions
   use an index if an appropriate index exists; however, ``/^a.*/``,
   and ``/^a.*$/`` are slower. ``/^a/`` can stop scanning after matching
   the prefix.
