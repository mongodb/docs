Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about the BSON data format, how MongoDB
uses BSON to organize and store data, and how to install the BSON library independently of
the {+driver-short+}.

BSON Data Format
----------------

**BSON**, or Binary JSON, is the data format that MongoDB uses to organize
and store data. This data format includes all JSON data structure types and
adds support for types including dates, differently-sized integers (32-bit and 64-bit),
ObjectIds, and binary data. For a complete list of supported types, see the
:manual:`BSON Types </reference/bson-types>` in the {+mdb-server+} documentation.

BSON is not human-readable, but you can use the
:ref:`BSON library <install-bson-library>` to convert it to the human-readable JSON
representation. You can read more about the relationship between these
formats in the :website:`JSON and BSON </json-and-bson>` guide on the MongoDB website.

MongoDB and BSON
----------------

You can work with BSON data in your {+driver-short+} application by using one of the
following object types that implements the `BSON interface <{+java-api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/conversions/Bson.html>`__:

- `Document <{+java-api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/Document.html>`__ (BSON library package)
- `BsonDocument <{+java-api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/BsonDocument.html>`__ (BSON library package)
- `RawBsonDocument <{+java-api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/RawBsonDocument.html>`__ (BSON library package)
- `JsonObject <{+java-api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/json/JsonObject.html>`__ (BSON library package)

Install the BSON Library
------------------------

These instructions detail how to add the BSON library as a dependency to
your project.

.. note::

   If you have already added the {+driver-short+} as a dependency to your
   project, then you can skip this step. This is because the BSON library is already
   included as a required dependency of the driver.

For instructions on how to add the {+driver-long+} as a dependency to your project, see the
:ref:`driver installation <kotlin-sync-download-install>` section of our Get Started
guide.

We recommend that you use the `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ or
`Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__ build automation tool to manage your {+language+}
project's dependencies. The following instructions detail the dependency declarations for
both Maven and Gradle:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Maven
      :tabid: maven-dependencies

      The following snippet shows the dependency declaration in the
      ``dependencies`` section of your ``pom.xml`` file.

      .. include:: /includes/data-formats/bson-maven-versioned.rst

   .. tab:: Gradle
      :tabid: gradle-dependencies

      The following snippet shows the dependency declaration in the
      ``dependencies`` object in your ``build.gradle`` file.

      .. include:: /includes/data-formats/bson-gradle-versioned.rst

If you are not using either of the preceding tools, then you can include the BSON dependency
in your project by downloading the JAR file directly from the
`sonatype repository <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/mongodb/bson/>`__.
