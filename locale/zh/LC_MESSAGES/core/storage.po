"MongoDB supports multiple record allocation strategies that determine how "
":program:`mongod` adds padding to a document when creating a :term:`record`."
" Because documents in MongoDB may grow after insertion and all records are "
"contiguous on disk, the padding can reduce the need to relocate documents on"
" disk following updates. Relocations are less efficient than in-place "
"updates, and can lead to storage fragmentation. As a result, all padding "
"strategies trade additional space for increased efficiency and decreased "
"fragmentation."
