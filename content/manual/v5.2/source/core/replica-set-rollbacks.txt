Rollbacks During Replica Set Failover
=====================================

A rollback reverts write operations on a former :term:`primary` when the
member rejoins its :term:`replica set` after a :term:`failover`.
A rollback is necessary only if the primary had accepted write
operations that the :term:`secondaries <secondary>` had **not**
successfully replicated before the primary stepped down. When the
primary rejoins the set as a secondary, it reverts, or "rolls back," its
write operations to maintain database consistency with the other
members.

MongoDB attempts to avoid rollbacks, which should be rare. When a
rollback does occur, it is often the result of a network
partition. Secondaries that can not keep up with the throughput of
operations on the former primary, increase the size and impact of the
rollback.

A rollback does *not* occur if the write operations replicate to another
member of the replica set before the primary steps down *and* if that
member remains available and accessible to a majority of the replica
set.

Collect Rollback Data
---------------------

Configure Rollback Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB adds the parameter
:parameter:`createRollbackDataFiles` to control whether or not rollback
files are created during rollbacks.

.. _replica-set-rollback-data:

Rollback Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, when a rollback occurs, MongoDB writes the rollback data to
:term:`BSON` files.

.. note:: Rollback Directory Change
   
   Starting in Mongo 4.4, the rollback directory for a collection is named
   after the collection's UUID rather than the collection namespace.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: MongoDB 4.4+
      :tabid: 4.4
   
      For each collection whose data is rolled back, the
      rollback files are located in a ``<dbpath>/rollback/<collectionUUID>``
      directory and have filenames of the form:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         removed.<timestamp>.bson   

      For example, if data for the collection ``comments`` in the
      ``reporting`` database rolled back:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         <dbpath>/rollback/20f74796-d5ea-42f5-8c95-f79b39bad190/removed.2020-02-19T04-57-11.0.bson

      where ``<dbpath>`` is the :binary:`~bin.mongod`'s :setting:`~storage.dbPath`.

      .. tip:: Collection Name

         To get the collection name, you can search for ``rollback
         file`` in the MongoDB log. For example, if the log file is
         ``/var/log/mongodb/mongod.log``, you can use ``grep`` to
         search for instances of ``"rollback file"`` in the log:

         .. code-block:: bash

            grep "rollback file" /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

         Alternatively, you can loop through all the databases and run
         :method:`db.getCollectionInfos()` for the specific UUID until
         you get a match. For example:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            var mydatabases=db.adminCommand("listDatabases").databases;
            var foundcollection=false;

            for (var i = 0; i < mydatabases.length; i++) {
               let mdb = db.getSiblingDB(mydatabases[i].name);
               collections = mdb.getCollectionInfos( { "info.uuid": UUID("20f74796-d5ea-42f5-8c95-f79b39bad190") } );

               for (var j = 0; j < collections.length; j++) {   // Array of 1 element
                  foundcollection=true;
                  print(mydatabases[i].name + '.' + collections[j].name);
                  break;
               }

               if (foundcollection) { break; }
            }

   .. tab:: MongoDB 4.2-4.0
      :tabid: 4.2

      For each collection whose data is rolled back, the
      rollback files are located in a ``<dbpath>/rollback/<db>.<collection>``
      directory and have filenames of the form:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         removed.<timestamp>.bson   

      For example, if data for the collection ``comments`` in the
      ``reporting`` database rolled back:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         <dbpath>/rollback/reporting.comments/removed.2019-01-31T02-57-40.0.bson

      where ``<dbpath>`` is the :binary:`~bin.mongod`'s :setting:`~storage.dbPath`.

   .. tab:: MongoDB 3.6 and earlier
      :tabid: 3.6

      In versions 3.6 and earlier, rollback files are located directly under the
      ``<dbpath>/rollback`` directory with the filenames of the form
      ``<db>.<collection>.<timestamp>.bson``.
      
      For example, if data for the collection ``comments`` in the
      ``reporting`` database rolled back:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         <dbpath>/rollbacktest.col.2020-02-19T04-46-22.0.bson

Rollback Data Exclusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the operation to roll back is a collection drop or a document
deletion, the rollback of the collection drop or document deletion
is not written to the rollback data directory.

Read Rollback Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To read the contents of the rollback files, use :binary:`~bin.bsondump`.
Based on the content and the knowledge of their applications,
administrators can decide the next course of action to take.

.. _rollback-avoid:

Avoid Replica Set Rollbacks
---------------------------

For replica sets, the :doc:`write concern </reference/write-concern>`
:writeconcern:`{ w: 1 } <\<number\>>` only provides acknowledgement of write
operations on the primary. Data may be rolled back if the primary steps
down before the write operations have replicated to any of the
secondaries. This includes data written in :doc:`multi-document
transactions </core/transactions>` that commit using
:writeconcern:`{ w: 1 } <\<number\>>` write concern.

Journaling and Write Concern ``majority``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To prevent rollbacks of data that have been acknowledged to the client,
run all voting members with journaling enabled and use :ref:`{ w:
"majority" } write concern <wc-w>` to guarantee that the write operations
propagate to a majority of the replica set nodes before returning with
acknowledgement to the issuing client.

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, ``{ w: "majority" }`` is the default write concern
for *most* MongoDB deployments. See :ref:`wc-default-behavior`.

Size Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 4.0

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB has no limit on the amount of data
that can be rolled back.

In previous versions, a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance will not
roll back more than 300 megabytes of data and requires manual
intervention if more than 300 megabytes of data need to be rolled back.

.. _rollback-time-limit:

Rollback Elapsed Time Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.0, the rollback time limit defaults to 24 hours
and is configurable using the parameter
:parameter:`rollbackTimeLimitSecs`:

- In MongoDB 4.2+ and 4.0.13+, the rollback time limit is calculated
  between the first operation after the common point and the last point
  in the oplog for the member to roll back.

- In MongoDB 4.0.0-4.0.12, the rollback time limit is calculated between the
  common point and the last point in the oplog for the member to roll
  back.

In MongoDB 3.6 and earlier, the rollback time limit is not configurable.
For these versions, rollback is limited by the amount of data, with a
maximum of 300 megabytes.
