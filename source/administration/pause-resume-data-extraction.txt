You can pause and resume extraction of snapshot data from the |service| 
cluster to {+adl+} datasets. 

Pause Data Extraction for Your {+dl+} Pipeline 
-------------------------------------------------

When you pause your {+dl+} pipeline, |service| doesn't ingest new 
datasets. You can continue to query previous snapshots that have been 
ingested. 

To pause a pipeline:

.. procedure:: 

   .. step:: Navigate to {+adl+} in the |service| UI. 

      To navigate to the {+adl+} page: 

      1. Log in to `MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`__.
      #. Select :guilabel:`Data Lake` under :guilabel:`Deployment` 
         on the left-hand navigation.

   .. step:: Click :icon-fa4:`ellipsis-v` in the :guilabel:`Actions` column for the pipeline that you wish to pause and select :guilabel:`Pause Ingestion`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Confirm` in the :guilabel:`Pause Ingestion` confirmation window.

      When you pause your {+dl+} pipeline, the :guilabel:`Last Updated` 
      column for the pipeline in the |service| UI shows the status 
      for the pipeline as :guilabel:`Paused`. 

Resume Data Extraction for Your {+dl+} Pipeline
--------------------------------------------------

When you resume data extraction for a paused {+adl+} pipeline, 
|service| begins to take snapshots, which are then ingested in to your 
{+dl+} datasets. 

To resume data extraction: 

.. procedure:: 

   .. step:: Navigate to {+adl+} in the |service| UI. 

      To navigate to the {+adl+} page: 

      1. Log in to `MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com>`__.
      #. Select :guilabel:`Data Lake` under :guilabel:`Deployment` 
         on the left-hand navigation.

   .. step:: Click :icon-fa4:`ellipsis-v` in the :guilabel:`Actions` column for the pipeline that you wish to resume and select :guilabel:`Resume Ingestion`.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Confirm` in the :guilabel:`Resume Ingestion` confirmation window.

      When you resume data extraction for a paused {+adl+} pipeline, 
      the :guilabel:`Last Updated` column for the pipeline in the 
      |service| UI shows the date and time when data extraction for 
      the pipeline resumed.
