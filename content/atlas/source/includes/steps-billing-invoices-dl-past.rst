        which shows your usage and amount due for the previous billing period.
      
      - The :ref:`billing cost visualization charts 
        <billing-visualizations>`.

           :widths: 20 80
           :header-rows: 1
           :stub-columns: 1

      - To filter by invoice date, set the :guilabel:`From` or
        :guilabel:`To` date inputs to the required date range.
      
        - If you leave :guilabel:`From` blank, |service| sets the lower
          date boundary to the organization's creation date.
      
        - If you leave :guilabel:`To` blank, |service| sets the upper date
          boundary to the current date.

      From your invoice's :guilabel:`Download As` column, select
      :guilabel:`PDF` or :guilabel:`CSV`.
