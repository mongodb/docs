.. method:: db.collection.mapReduce(map,reduce,out,[query],[sort],[limit],[finalize],[scope],[jsMode],[verbose])

   The :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` provides a wrapper around the
   :dbcommand:`mapReduce` :term:`database command`. Always call the
   :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` method on a collection. The following
   argument list specifies a :term:`document` with 3 required and
   8 optional fields:

   :param map: A JavaScript function that performs the "map" step of
               the MapReduce operation. This function references the
               current input document and calls the
               ``emit(key,value)`` method to supply the value
               argument to the reduce function, grouped by the key
               argument. Map functions may call ``emit()``, once, more
               than once, or not at all depending on the type of
               aggregation.

   :param reduce: A JavaScript function that performs the "reduce"
                  step of the MapReduce operation. The reduce function
                  receives a key value and an array of emitted values
                  from the map function, and returns a single
                  value. Because it's possible to invoke the reduce
                  function more than once for the same key, the
                  structure of the object returned by function must be
                  identical to the structure of the emitted function.

   :param out: Specifies the location of the out of the reduce stage
               of the operation. Specify a string to write the output
               of the map-reduce job to a collection with that
               name. The map-reduce operation will replace the content
               of the specified collection in the current database by
               default. See below for additional options.

   :param document query: Optional. A query object, like the query used by the
                          :method:`db.collection.find()` method. Use this to specify
                          which documents should enter the map phase
                          of the aggregation.

   :param sort: Optional. Sorts the input objects using this key. This
                option is useful for optimizing the job. Common uses
                include sorting by the emit key so that there are
                fewer reduces.

   :param limit: Optional. Specifies a maximum number of objects to
                 return from the collection.

   :param finalize: Optional. Specifies an optional "finalize" function
                    to run on a result, following the reduce
                    stage, to modify or control the output of
                    the :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` operation.

   :param scope: Optional. Place a :term:`document` as the contents of
                 this field, to place fields into the global
                 javascript scope for the execution of the
                 map-reduce command.


   :param Boolean jsMode: Optional. Specifies whether to convert
                          intermediate data into BSON format between
                          the mapping and reducing steps.

                          If false, map-reduce execution internally
                          converts the values emitted during the map
                          function from JavaScript objects into BSON
                          objects, and so must convert those BSON
                          objects into JavaScript objects when calling
                          the reduce function.  When this argument is
                          false, :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`
                          places the :term:`BSON` objects used for
                          intermediate values in temporary, on-disk
                          storage, allowing the map-reduce job to
                          execute over arbitrarily large data sets.

                          If true, map-reduce execution retains the
                          values emitted by the map function and
                          returned as JavaScript objects, and so does
                          not need to do extra conversion work to call
                          the reduce function.  When this argument is
                          true, the map-reduce job can execute faster,
                          but can only work for result sets with less
                          than 500K distinct key arguments to the
                          mapper's emit function.

                          The ``jsMode`` option defaults to
                          true.

                          .. versionadded: 2.0

   :param Boolean verbose: Optional. The ``verbose`` option provides
                           statistics on job execution times.

   The ``out`` field of the :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`, provides a
   number of additional configuration options that you may use to
   control how MongoDB returns data from the map-reduce job. Consider
   the following 4 output possibilities.

   .. versionadded: 1.8

   :param replace: Optional. Specify a collection name (e.g. ``{ out:
                   { replace: collectionName } }``) where the output
                   of the map-reduce overwrites the contents of the
                   collection specified (i.e. ``collectionName``) if
                   there is any data in that collection. This is the
                   default behavior if you only specify a collection
                   name in the ``out`` field.

   :param merge: Optional. Specify a collection name (e.g. ``{ out: {
                 merge: collectionName } }``) where the
                 map-reduce operation writes output to an
                 existing collection
                 (i.e. ``collectionName``,) and only
                 overwrites existing documents in the
                 collection when a new document has the same
                 key as a document that existed before the
                 map-reduce operation began.

   :param reduce: Optional. This operation behaves like the ``merge``
                  option above, except that when an existing
                  document has the same key as a new
                  document, ``reduce`` function from the
                  map reduce job will run on both values and
                  MongoDB will write the result of this function
                  to the new collection. The specification
                  takes the form of ``{ out: { reduce:
                  collectionName } }``, where
                  ``collectionName`` is the name of the
                  results collection.

   :param inline: Optional. Indicate the inline option (i.e. ``{ out:
                  { inline: 1 } }``) to perform the map
                  reduce job in memory and return the results
                  at the end of the function. This option is
                  only possible when the entire result set
                  will fit within the :ref:`maximum size of a
                  BSON document <limit-bson-document-size>`.
                  When performing map-reduce jobs on
                  secondary members of replica sets, this is
                  the only available ``out`` option.

   :param db: Optional. The name of the database that you want the
              map-reduce operation to write its output. By default
              this will be the same database as the input collection.

   :param sharded: Optional. If ``true``, *and* the output mode writes
                   to a collection, and the output database has
                   sharding enabled, the map-reduce operation will
                   shard the results collection according to the
                   ``_id`` field.
