.. _3.4-rel-notes-sharded-cluster:

Sharded Cluster
---------------

Membership Awareness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in 3.4, sharded cluster components (shards, config servers,
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances) recognize their membership in a sharded
cluster, including the name of the sharded cluster, the location of the
config servers.

.. COMMENT To DOCS TEAM: Make sure we single source these things since used in relnotes and compatibility

To support this awareness:

- ``shardsvr`` Requirement
     For a 3.4 sharded cluster, :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances for the
     shards **must** explicitly specify its role as a ``shardsvr``,
     either via the configuration file setting
     :setting:`sharding.clusterRole` or via the command line option
     :option:`--shardsvr <mongod --shardsvr>`.

     .. note::

        Default port for :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances with the ``shardsvr``
        role is ``27018``. To use a different port, specify
        :setting:`net.port` setting or ``--port`` option.

     .. COMMENT To DOCS TEAM: Ensure that in all our sharding tutorials we specify shardsvr.

- 3.4 ``mongos`` Incompatibility with Earlier Versions of ``mongod``
   Version 3.4 :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances cannot connect to
   earlier versions of :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

Balancer on Config Server Primary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The balancer process has moved from the :binary:`~bin.mongos` to the
primary member of the config server replica set. Associated with this
change:

- The primary of the CSRS config server holds the ``"balancer"`` lock,
  using a process id named ``"ConfigServer"``, which is never released.

- MongoDB 3.4 adds:

  - :dbcommand:`balancerStart` command and updates the 3.4
    :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method :method:`sh.startBalancer()` to wrap
    the new command. A 3.2 or earlier :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
    :method:`sh.startBalancer()` is incompatible with a 3.4 sharded
    cluster.

  - :dbcommand:`balancerStop` command and updates the 3.4
    :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` to wrap
    the new command. A 3.2 or earlier :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
    :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` is incompatible with a 3.4 sharded
    cluster.

  - :dbcommand:`balancerStatus` command.

- MongoDB 3.4 deprecates :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell method
  :method:`sh.getBalancerHost()`. A 3.2 or earlier :binary:`~bin.mongo`
  shell method :method:`sh.getBalancerHost()` is incompatible with a
  3.4 sharded cluster.

- MongoDB 3.4 removes the following configuration options from the
  :binary:`~bin.mongos`:

  - :setting:`sharding.chunkSize` configuration file setting and
    ``--chunkSize`` command-line option

  - :setting:`sharding.autoSplit` configuration file setting and
    ``--noAutoSplit`` command-line option

Faster Balancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 3.4:

- For :ref:`WiredTiger <storage-wiredtiger>`, the default value
  ``secondaryThrottle`` is ``false`` for all chunk migrations. The
  balancer does not wait for replication to a secondary and instead
  continues with the next document.

- MongoDB can perform parallel chunk migrations. Similar to earlier
  versions, a shard can participate in at most one migration at a time.
  Observing this restriction, for a sharded cluster with *n* shards,
  MongoDB can perform at most *n/2* (rounded down) simultaneous chunk
  migrations.

.. _3.4-remove-sccc:

Removal of Support for SCCC Config Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.4 sharded clusters no longer support the use of mirrored (SCCC)
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances as config servers. The use of SCCC config
servers, deprecated in the 3.2 release, is no longer valid. Instead,
deploy your config servers as a replica set (CSRS).

To upgrade your sharded cluster to version 3.4, the config servers must
be running as a replica set.

To convert your existing config servers from SCCC to CSRS, see the
:v3.4:`Upgrade Config Servers to Replica Set
</tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set>`.

Sharding Zones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.4 introduces :doc:`/core/zone-sharding`, which supersedes
tag-aware sharding available in earlier versions.

To support zones, MongoDB introduces the following commands and
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell helpers:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Commands
     - `mongo` Shell Methods

   * - :dbcommand:`addShardToZone`
     - :method:`sh.addShardToZone()`

   * - :dbcommand:`removeShardFromZone`
     -  :method:`sh.removeShardFromZone()`

   * - :dbcommand:`updateZoneKeyRange`
     - | :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()`
       | :method:`sh.removeRangeFromZone()`

.. _3.4-replica-set:

Replica Set
-----------

Default Journaling Behavior of ``majority`` Write Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new replica set configuration setting
:rsconf:`writeConcernMajorityJournalDefault` determines whether an
acknowledgement for a write concern of :writeconcern:`majority
<"majority">` returns after the majority of the voting members apply
the write in memory or to the on-disk journal *if* the :ref:`j <wc-j>`
option is unspecified in the write concern.

Adjustable Catchup Period for Newly Elected Primary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new replica set configuration setting
:rsconf:`settings.catchUpTimeoutMillis` defines the time limit for a
newly elected primary to catch up with the other replica set members
that may have more recent writes.

Linearizable Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.4 introduces a read concern level of
:readconcern:`"linearizable"` to read data that reflects all successful
writes issued with a :writeconcern:`"majority"` *and* acknowledged
prior to the start of the read operation. Linearizable read concern
guarantees only apply if read operations specify a query filter that
uniquely identifies a single document.

Linearizable read concern is available for all MongoDB supported
:doc:`storage engines </core/storage-engines>`.

Combined with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern,
:readconcern:`"linearizable"` read concern enables multiple threads to
perform reads and writes on a single document as if a single thread
performed these operations in real time; that is, the corresponding
schedule for these reads and writes is considered linearizable.

Reads with linearizable read concern may be significantly slower than
reads with :readconcern:`"majority"` or :readconcern:`"local"` read
concerns. Always use ``maxTimeMS`` with linearizable read concern, in
case a majority of data bearing members are unavailable. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.find( { _id: 5 } ).readConcern("linearizable").maxTimeMS(10000)

   db.runCommand( {
        find: "restaurants",
        filter: { _id: 5 },
        readConcern: { level: "linearizable" },
        maxTimeMS: 10000
   } )

For more information on read concern, including operations that support
read concerns, see :doc:`/reference/read-concern`.

Improved Initial Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- MongoDB 3.4 improves the performance of :ref:`initial sync
  <replica-set-initial-sync>` by having initial sync build the indexes
  as the documents are copied.

- MongoDB 3.4 improves the :ref:`initial sync retry logic
  <init-sync-retry>` to be more resilient to intermittent failures on
  the network.

- To avoid potential data corruption, MongoDB 3.4 fails and restarts
  :ref:`initial sync <replica-set-initial-sync>` if a collection is
  renamed on the sync source during the initial sync. With MongoDB 3.2.11
  or earlier, initial syncs did not fail and restart but instead
  continued the process, which could lead to potential data corruption.

  For details, see :ref:`3.4-compatibility-initial-sync`.

- Modified :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus` command to accept the optional
  ``initialSync: 1`` in the command to report on initial sync status
  and progress if run on the secondary:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.adminCommand( { replSetGetStatus: 1, initialSync: 1 } )

.. _3.4-decimal:

Decimal Type
------------

3.4 adds support for the `decimal128 format
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal128_floating-point_format>`_ with
the new ``decimal`` data type. The decimal128 format supports numbers with
up to 34 decimal digits (i.e. significant digits) and an exponent range
of −6143 to +6144.

To support the format, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell adds the
:ref:`NumberDecimal <shell-type-decimal>` wrapper.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.insert( {_id: 1, item: "The Scream", price: NumberDecimal("9.99"), quantity: 4 } )

When performing :ref:`comparisons <bson-types-comparison-order>` among
different numerical types, MongoDB performs comparison on the exact
stored numerical values without first converting values to a common
type.

Unlike the ``double`` data type, which only stores an approximation of
the decimal values, the ``decimal`` data type stores the exact value.
For example, a ``decimal`` ``NumberDecimal("9.99")`` has a precise
value of ``9.99`` where as a double ``9.99`` would have an approximate
value of ``9.9900000000000002131628...``.

To test for ``decimal`` type, use the :query:`$type` operator with the
literal ``"decimal"`` or ``19``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.inventory.find( { price: { $type: "decimal" } } )

To use the new ``decimal`` data type with a MongoDB driver, an upgrade
to a driver version that supports the feature is necessary.

.. _3.4-rel-notes-aggregation-cluster:

Aggregation
-----------

New Aggregation Stage for Recursive Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.4 introduces a stage to the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>` that allows for recursive search.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Stage
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$graphLookup`

     - Performs a recursive search on a collection. To each output
       document, adds a new array field that contains the traversal
       results of the recursive search for that document.

.. seealso:: `Webinar: Working with Graph Data in MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.com/presentations/webinar-working-with-graph-data-in-mongodb?tck=docs_server>`_

New Aggregation Stages for Faceted Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Faceted search allows for the categorization of documents into
classifications. For example, given a collection of inventory
documents, you may want to classify items by a single category, such as
by the price range, or by multiple categories, such as by price range
as well as separately by the departments.

3.4 introduces stages to the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>` that allow for faceted search.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Stage
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$bucket`

     - Categorizes or groups incoming documents into buckets that
       represent a range of values for a specified expression.

   * - :pipeline:`$bucketAuto`

     - Categorizes or groups incoming documents into specified number
       of buckets that represent a range of values for a specified
       expression. MongoDB automatically determines the bucket
       boundaries.

   * - :pipeline:`$facet`

     - Processes multiple :ref:`pipelines <aggregation-pipeline>` on
       the input documents and outputs a document that contains the
       results of these pipelines. By specifying facet-related stages
       (:pipeline:`$bucket`, :pipeline:`$bucketAuto`, and
       :pipeline:`$sortByCount`) in these pipelines, :pipeline:`$facet`
       allows for multi-faceted search.

   * - :pipeline:`$sortByCount`

     - Categorizes or groups incoming documents by a specified
       expression to compute the count for each group. Output documents
       are sorted in descending order by the count.

   * - Stage
     - Description

   * - :pipeline:`$addFields`

     - Adds new fields to documents. The stage outputs documents that
       contains all existing fields from the input documents as well as
       the newly added fields.

   * - :pipeline:`$replaceRoot`

     - Replaces a document with the specified document. You can specify
       a document embedded in the input document to promote the
       embedded document to the top level.

New Aggregation Stage to Count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.4 introduces a new stage to the :doc:`aggregation pipeline
</core/aggregation-pipeline>` that faciliate counting document.

.. _3.4-relnotes-collation:

Collation and Case-Insensitive Indexes
--------------------------------------

To allow for language-specific rules for string comparison, MongoDB
3.4 introduces :doc:`collation </reference/collation>` to its query language and
indexes.

The following operations support collation:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-operations-table.rst

For details, see :doc:`Collation </reference/collation>`.

.. [#index-restriction]

   Some index types do not support collation. See
   :ref:`collation-unsupported-index-types` for details.

.. _3.4-relnotes-views:

Views
-----

MongoDB 3.4 adds support for creating read-only views from existing
collections or other views. To specify or define a view, MongoDB 3.4
introduces:

- the ``viewOn`` and ``pipeline`` options to the existing
  :dbcommand:`create` command:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { create: <view>, viewOn: <source>, pipeline: <pipeline> } )

  or if specifying a default :ref:`collation <3.4-relnotes-collation>` for the view:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.runCommand( { create: <view>, viewOn: <source>, pipeline: <pipeline>, collation: <collation> } )

- and a corresponding :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell helper
  :method:`db.createView()`:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.createView(<view>, <source>, <pipeline>, <collation>)

For more information on creating views, see :ref:`3.4-reference-views`.

Security Enhancement
--------------------

Transition to Auth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 3.4 adds support for rolling transition to internal
authentication for replica sets and sharded clusters. For details, see
:setting:`security.transitionToAuth` setting and ``--transitionToAuth``
command line option for :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`/tutorial/enforce-keyfile-access-control-in-existing-replica-set-without-downtime`

User Roles Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-3.4-built-in-roles-changes.rst

MongoDB Tools
-------------

``mongoreplay``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB introduces :binary:`~bin.mongoreplay`, a workload capture and
analysis tool that replaces :binary:`~bin.mongosniff`. You can use
:binary:`~bin.mongoreplay` to inspect and record commands sent to a MongoDB
instance, and then replay the commands back onto another host at a
later time.

:binary:`~bin.mongoreplay` is available for Linux and macOS.

General Enhancements
--------------------

MongoDB 3.4 includes the following enhancements:

- Added ``systemd`` support in distributions.

- Increased :parameter:`diagnosticDataCollectionDirectorySizeMB`
  default size to 200 megabytes from 100 megabytes.

- Decreased the lower bound and the default setting of the
  :option:`WiredTiger internal cache <mongod --wiredTigerCacheSizeGB>`. Both
  the :option:`WiredTiger Storage Engine internal cache
  <mongod --wiredTigerCacheSizeGB>` and the :option:`inMemory Storage Engine
  maximum memory size <mongod --inMemorySizeGB>` can accept floating-point values.

- :method:`~db.collection.find()`,
  :method:`~db.collection.aggregate()`, :dbcommand:`listIndexes`, and
  :dbcommand:`listCollections` operations return a :ref:`maximum of 16
  megabytes per batch <cursor-batches>`.

:method:`db.currentOp` and the
:doc:`database profiler</reference/database-profiler>` report the same
basic diagnostic information for all CRUD operations, including the
following:

- .. include:: /includes/fact-diagnostic-info.rst

- :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell adds support for marshalling fields of type
  :ref:`javascript<bson-types>` and
  :ref:`javascriptWithScope<bson-types>` to JavaScript functions.
  See :option:`--disableJavaScriptProtection <mongo --disableJavaScriptProtection>`.

- Added support for system certificates. If a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  instance presents a certificate signed with a CA trusted by the
  operating system, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell will connect without any
  errors. Previously, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell exited with an error
  that it could not validate the certificate.

- Added message compression support for internal communication between
  members of a replica set or a sharded cluster as well as
  communication between :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
  :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

  See configuration :setting:`net.compression.compressors` setting as
  well as the ``--networkMessageCompressors`` option for
  :binary:`~bin.mongod`, :binary:`~bin.mongos`, and the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

- Upgraded the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine to 45.0.2 ESR.

Platform Support
----------------

- MongoDB 3.4 introduces support for ARM64, PPC64LE, and s390x
  architectures. See :ref:`prod-notes-supported-platforms` to see the
  full platform support matrix.

- .. include:: /includes/fact-installation-rhel5.rst

.. include:: /includes/admonition-power-ubuntu-restriction.rst

.. include:: /includes/list-table-products-supported-architecture.rst

For details, refer to the individual documentation for the products.

MongoDB Enterprise Features
---------------------------

Log Redaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB Enterprise adds support for log redaction for use in
conjunction with MongoDB's :doc:`encrypted storage engine
</core/security-encryption-at-rest>`. Log redaction prevents
potentially sensitive information from being written to the diagnostic
log; however, diagnostics on redacted logs may be more difficult due to
the lack of data related to a log event.

To enable log redaction, see the
:setting:`security.redactClientLogData` setting and the
:option:`--redactClientLogData <mongod --redactClientLogData>` option for :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

LDAP Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LDAP Authorization
``````````````````

MongoDB Enterprise supports the use of :doc:`Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP) service to authorize (i.e. determine access)
</core/security-ldap-external>` a user authenticated via one of the
following authentication mechanism:

- :doc:`/core/security-ldap`. For a tutorial on using both LDAP
  Authentication and Authorization, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/authenticate-nativeldap-activedirectory`.

- :doc:`/core/kerberos`. For a tutorial on using Kerberos
  authentication and Active Directory, see
  :doc:`/tutorial/kerberos-auth-activedirectory-authz`.

- :doc:`/core/security-x.509`.

For more information, see :doc:`/core/security-ldap-external`.

``mongoldap``
`````````````

MongoDB Enterprise provides a new tool :binary:`~bin.mongoldap` for testing
your MongoDB :ref:`LDAP configuration options <security.ldap.options>`
against a running LDAP server or set of servers. When configuring
options related to :ref:`LDAP authentication <security-ldap>`, you can
use :binary:`~bin.mongoldap` to ensure that the authentication operation
works as expected.

Bind via OS Libraries
``````````````````````

MongoDB 3.4 supports :doc:`binding to an LDAP server
</core/security-ldap>` via operating system libraries. This allows
Linux and Windows MongoDB 3.4 servers to use an LDAP server for
authentication.

Linux MongoDB deployments continue to support binding via `saslauthd
<http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/saslauthd8.html>`_.
