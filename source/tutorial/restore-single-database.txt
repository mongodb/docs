Overview
--------

Backup snapshots contain a complete copy of your :program:`mongod` data
directory. There may be occasions when you want to restore only part of
the data in a snapshot. To restore a single database instead of all
databases in the snapshot, load the snapshot first to a temporary
:program:`mongod` instance and then export from this instance the
single database. Use the export of the single database to restore to
the target deployment.

.. note::
   As of MongoDB 3.0, :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore`
   no longer support the :option:`--dbpath` option. These tools now
   must connect to a running :program:`mongod` instance.

Considerations
--------------

Before you attempt a restore, ensure your target storage has sufficient
space for the restore files and the restored database, plus additional
space for dataset growth. Use :manual:`db.stats()` to find the current
database size.

Restore the Database
--------------------

The following examples use:

- ``27017`` as the port for a running MongoDB instance that receives
  the restored backup.

- ``27018`` as the port for the temporary MongoDB instance that
  uses the snapshot to export the single database.
