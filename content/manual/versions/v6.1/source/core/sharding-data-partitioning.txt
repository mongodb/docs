MongoDB uses the :term:`shard key` associated to the collection to 
partition the data into :term:`chunks<chunk>` owned by a specific shard. 
A :term:`chunk` consists of a :term:`range` of sharded data. A range can
be a portion of the chunk or the whole chunk. The balancer migrates
data between shards. Each chunk has inclusive lower and exclusive upper 
limits based on the :term:`shard key`.

.. include:: /images/sharding-range-based.rst

The smallest unit of data a chunk can represent is a single unique shard 
key value.

Initial Chunks
--------------

Populated Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The sharding operation creates one large initial chunk to cover all 
  of the shard key values.

- After the initial chunk creation, the balancer moves ranges off of 
  the initial chunk when it needs to start balancing data.

.. _initial-ranges-empty-collection:

Empty Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- If you have :ref:`zones and zone ranges <zone-sharding>` defined
  for an empty or non-existing collection.

  - The sharding operation creates empty chunks for the defined zone
    ranges as well as any additional chunks to cover the entire range
    of the shard key values and performs an initial chunk distribution
    based on the zone ranges. This initial creation and distribution of
    chunks allows for faster setup of zoned sharding.

  - After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the chunk
    distribution going forward.


- If you do not have zones and zone ranges defined
  for an empty or non-existing collection:

  - For hashed sharding:

    - The sharding operation creates empty chunks to cover the
      entire range of the shard key values and performs an initial
      chunk distribution. By default, the
      operation creates 2 chunks per shard and migrates across the
      cluster. You can use ``numInitialChunks`` option to specify a
      different number of initial chunks. This initial creation and
      distribution of chunks allows for faster setup of
      sharding.

    - After the initial distribution, the balancer manages the chunk
      distribution going forward.

  - For ranged sharding:

    - The sharding operation creates a single empty chunk to cover the
      entire range of the shard key values.

    - After the initial chunk creation, the balancer migrates the
      initial chunk across the shards as appropriate as well as manages
      the chunk distribution going forward.

Range Size
----------

The default :term:`range` size in MongoDB is 128 megabytes. You can
:ref:`increase or reduce the chunk size 
<tutorial-modifying-range-size>`. Consider the implications of changing 
the default chunk size:

#. Small ranges lead to a more even distribution of data at the
   expense of more frequent migrations. This creates expense at the
   query routing (:binary:`~bin.mongos`) layer.

#. Large ranges lead to fewer migrations. This is more efficient both
   from the networking perspective *and* in terms of internal overhead at
   the query routing layer. But, these efficiencies come at
   the expense of a potentially uneven distribution of data.

#. Range size affects the
   :limit:`Maximum Number of Documents Per Range to Migrate`.

For many deployments, it makes sense to avoid frequent and potentially
spurious migrations at the expense of a slightly less evenly
distributed data set.

Range Migration
---------------

MongoDB migrates data ranges in a :term:`sharded cluster` to distribute 
the data of a sharded collection evenly among shards. Migrations may be
either:

.. _sharding-chunk-migration-manual:
.. _sharding-range-migration-manual:

- Manual. Only use manual migration in limited cases, such as
  to distribute data during bulk inserts. See :ref:`Migrating Chunks
  Manually <migrate-chunks-sharded-cluster>` for more details.

.. _sharding-chunk-migration-automatic:
.. _sharding-range-migration-automatic:

- Automatic. The :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` process
  automatically migrates data when there is an uneven distribution of
  a sharded collection's data across the shards. See :ref:`Migration 
  Thresholds <sharding-migration-thresholds>` for more details.

For more information on the sharded cluster :term:`balancer`, see
:ref:`sharding-balancing`.

Balancing
~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing-internals>` is a background
process that manages data migrations. If the difference in
amount of data between the largest and smallest shard exceed the
:ref:`migration thresholds<sharding-migration-thresholds>`, the balancer
begins migrating data across the cluster to ensure an even distribution.

.. include:: /images/sharding-migrating.rst

You can :ref:`manage <sharded-cluster-balancer>` certain aspects of the 
balancer. The balancer also respects any :term:`zones <zone>` created as 
a part of configuring zones in a sharded cluster.

See :ref:`sharding-balancing` for more information on the
:term:`balancer`.

.. _jumbo-chunks:
.. _jumbo-chunk:

Indivisible/Jumbo Chunks
------------------------

In some cases, chunks can grow beyond the :ref:`specified chunk size
<sharding-chunk-size>` but cannot undergo a split. The most common 
scenario is when a chunk represents a single shard key value. Since the 
chunk cannot split, it continues to grow beyond the chunk size, becoming 
a **jumbo** chunk. These **jumbo** chunks can become a performance 
bottleneck as they continue to grow, especially if the shard key value 
occurs with high :ref:`frequency<shard-key-frequency>`.

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, you can :ref:`reshard a collection
<sharding-resharding>` by changing a document's shard key.

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, MongoDB provides the
:dbcommand:`refineCollectionShardKey` command. Refining a collection's
shard key allows for a more fine-grained data distribution and can
address situations where the existing key insufficient cardinality
leads to jumbo chunks.

- :ref:`<clear-jumbo-flag>`
