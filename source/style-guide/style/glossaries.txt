Glossary Terms
--------------

To show the glossary term that you're defining, use the following
guidelines:

- Use the singular form unless the term is always plural. For example,
  use *server* instead of *servers*.
- Use lowercase letters unless the term is a proper noun or acronym.
  For example, use *server* instead of *Server*.
- If the term has an acronym or abbreviation, show the term either in
  its spelled-out form or shortened form, depending on which term is
  more familiar to users. If you use the spelled-out form, follow it
  with the abbreviation in parentheses.

To alphabetize glossary terms, use the word-by-word method. In this
method, terms that contain more than one word separated by spaces or
commas are alphabetized by the first word only, unless the first word
of two or more entries is the same. In that case, the second and
subsequent words are used to determine the alphabetical order. Hyphens,
slashes, and apostrophes continue a single word.

Glossary Definitions
--------------------

Make your glossary definitions brief. Try to restrict definitions to no
more than one or two short paragraphs, and avoid the inclusion of notes
or tips. If your definition is longer than one or two short paragraphs,
it might be more appropriate as a concept in an overview section rather
than in a glossary.

Begin the definition with a descriptive phrase. Capitalize the first
letter of the phrase, and end the phrase with a period. Follow the
initial phrase with one or more sentences as needed.

How you begin the definition also depends on what part of speech the
term is:

-  **Noun**: Begin with the appropriate article (a, an, or the) and a
   noun phrase.
-  **Verb**: Begin with the infinitive form of another verb that
   defines the term.
-  **Adjective**: Begin with a verb such as describes or pertains to.
-  **Abbreviation**: Begin with the spelled-out term.

The following table shows examples.

.. note::

   In a comprehensive glossary, you might need to start the definition
   with a qualifier that identifies the service to which the term
   relates. For more information, see `Guidelines for a comprehensive
   glossary <#guidelines-for-a-comprehensive-glossary>`__.

   * - Noun
     - **token**

       An opaque string that represents an authorization to access
       cloud resources. Tokens might be revoked at any time and are
       valid for a finite duration.
   * - Verb
     - **resize**

       To convert an existing server to a different flavor, in essence,
       scaling the server up or down. The original server is saved for
       a period of time to allow rollback if a problem occurs.
   * - Adjective
     - **RESTful**

       Describes a kind of web service API that uses REST.
   * - Abbreviation
     - **API**

       Application Programming Interface. A set of commands, functions,
       and protocols that programmers can use to create application
       services by using an open application.

Cross-References to Glossary Terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following guidelines when creating cross-references within a
glossary:

-  For a term with a definition located under a different entry, use a
   *See* entry in place of the definition.

-  For a term with a definition that's related to, is similar to, or
   contrasts with another term, refer to the term in one of the
   following ways. If that term actually occurs in the definition, you
   can simply link to its definition from the term. If the term doesn't
   occur in the definition, add a *See also* entry at the end of the
   definition.

   **Tip:** To highlight a difference between two terms, you can use a
   *Contrast with* entry.

-  Format the cross-reference as follows:

   -  If using a *See* or *See also* reference, type *See* or *See
      also*, and apply italics. If you're referring to more than one
      item, italicize *and*.

   -  Make the term a link to the cross-referenced term.

   * - **collection**

       A group of packages that have the same qualifier.
   * - **data point**

       A value that stores metrics. Metrics are stored as full
       resolution data points, which are periodically rolled up
       (condensed) into coarser data points. *See also* data
       granularity.
   * - **replace**

       To recover by dropping the selected database and re-creating it.
       *Contrast with* copy over.

Guidelines for a Comprehensive Glossary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A comprehensive glossary might have the following types of terms:

-  Industry-standard terms
-  Third-party product terms
-  MongoDB-specific terms that apply to only one service
-  MongoDB-specific terms that are general or apply to many different
   services
-  MongoDB-specific terms that apply to two or more services and have
   different meanings for two or more services

Following are guidelines for how to handle each type of term in the
comprehensive glossary:

-  Include industry-standard terms only if they're integral to
   understanding how a MongoDB service works. However, don't include
   terms that are well-known or common (such as *browser* and *blog*).
   In the definition, describe how MongoDB incorporates the idea
   represented by the term, or which service employs it. For example,
   *API*.

-  Avoid including third-party terms. Within the documentation itself,
   provide links to third-party websites if you want to provide more
   information about third-party terms. A MongoDB glossary should
   contain mainly MongoDB terms. If the user could find the meaning
   outside of a MongoDB document by using a browser search, then we
   probably don’t need to include it in the glossary. For example,
   *Apache*.

-  If a term is specific to one MongoDB service, start the definition
   with the name of that service in parentheses, and italicize it.

-  If a term is general or applies to many different services, you do
   not need to qualify it.

-  If a term is specific to more than one service but has a different
   meaning for each service, provide all the relevant definitions in
   one glossary entry. Place each definition in a separate paragraph
   and start the definition with the service name, in parentheses and
   italicized.
