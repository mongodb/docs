title: Disable the Balancer
level: 4
ref: sharding_tiered_storage_stop_balancer
pre: |
  The balancer must be disabled on the entire sharded cluster
  to ensure no migrations take place while configuring the new zones.
action:
  - pre: |
      Use :method:`sh.stopBalancer()` to stop the balancer for the cluster.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.stopBalancer()
post: |
  Use :method:`sh.isBalancerRunning()` to check if the balancer process 
  is currently running. Wait until any current balancing rounds have completed
  before proceeding.

title: Add each shard to the appropriate zone
level: 4
ref: sharding_tiered_storage_tag_shards
action:
  - pre: |
      Add ``shard0000`` to the ``recent`` zone.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addShardTag("shard0000", "recent")
  - pre: |
      Add ``shard0001`` to the ``recent`` zone.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addShardTag("shard0001", "recent")
  - pre: |
      Add ``shard0002`` to the ``archive`` zone.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addShardTag("shard0002", "archive")
post: |
  You can review the zone assigned to any given shard by running 
  :method:`sh.status()`.

stepnum: 3
title: Define ranges for each zone
level: 4
ref: sharding_tiered_storage_define_ranges
action:
  - pre: |
      Define range for recent photos and associate it to the ``recent`` zone 
      using the :method:`sh.addTagRange()` method. This method requires:
      
      * the full namespace of the target collection.
      * the inclusive lower bound of the range. 
      * the exclusive upper bound of the range. 
      * the zone.
      
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addTagRange( 
        "photoshare.data",
        { "creation_date" : ISODate("2016-01-01") },
        { "creation_date" : MaxKey }, 
        "recent"
      )
  - pre: |
      Define range for older photos and associate it to the 
      ``archive`` zone using the :method:`sh.addTagRange()` method. 
      This method requires:
      
      * the full namespace of the target collection.
      * the inclusive lower bound of the range. 
      * the exclusive upper bound of the range. 
      * the zone.
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.addTagRange( 
        "photoshare.data",
        { "creation_date" : MinKey },
        { "creation_date" : ISODate("2016-01-01") }, 
        "archive"
      )
post: |
  :bsontype:`MinKey` and :bsontype:`MaxKey` are reserved special values for
  comparisons.

stepnum: 4
title: Enable the Balancer
level: 4
ref: sharding_tiered_storage_start_balancer
pre: |
  Re-enable the balancer to rebalance the cluster.
action:
  - pre: |
      Use :method:`sh.enableBalancing()`, specifying the namespace of the
      collection, to start the balancer
    language: javascript
    code: |
      sh.enableBalancing("photoshare.data")
post: |
  Use :method:`sh.isBalancerRunning()` to check if the balancer process 
  is currently running.

stepnum: 5
title: Review the changes
level: 4
ref: sharding_tiered_storage_review
pre: |
  The next time the :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` runs, it 
  :ref:`splits <sharding-chunk-split>` and
  :ref:`migrates <sharding-chunk-migration>` chunks across the 
  shards respecting configured zones.
  
  Once balancing finishes, the shards in the ``recent`` zone should only
  contain documents with ``creation_date`` greater than or equal to
  ``ISODate("2016-01-01")``, while shards in the ``archive`` zone should
  only contain documents with ``creation_date`` less than
  ``ISODate("2016-01-01")``.
  
  You can confirm the chunk distribution by running :method:`sh.status()`.
