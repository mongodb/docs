.. .. IMPORTANT:: Per Andrew D / Bob G talk on 2016.04.12, we will NOT put dollars on this page
      because we don't currently have a process/mechanism to guarantee that the figures on this
      page are the most current.
..
..    The UI itself will the be THE definitive source of the current costs. This page will be
      the deeper explanation of how costs are calculated.
