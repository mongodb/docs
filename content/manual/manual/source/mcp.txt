.. note:: 

   The new MongoDB Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server is available in
   Public Preview. To learn more, see see `Preview Features 
   <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/preview-features/>`__.

You can use MCP Server to interact with your MongoDB clusters using
natural language prompts. 

Overview
--------

Originally introduced by Anthropic, MCP allows you to connect AI agents
to data systems. MCP allows integrated functionality and ensures the AI
Large Language Models (LLMs) have access to your latest database.

MCP Server connects the following MongoDB servers to clients that
support MCP:

- Atlas
- Community Edition
- Enterprise Advanced
- On-premises installations

The following clients support MCP:

- Anthropic Claude Desktop
- Windsurf Editor
- Cursor
- Visual Studio Code GitHub CoPilot

Install Claude Desktop
----------------------

You can perform MCP operations using Claude Desktop. To install Claude
Desktop, perform these steps:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Download and install Claude Desktop

      Go to the `Claude Download Page <https://claude.ai/download>`_ and
      follow the instructions to download and install Claude Desktop.

   .. step:: Start Claude Desktop and open the configuration file

      Start Claude Desktop and then select Settings -> Developer -> Edit
      Config. The configuration file is opened in a text editor.

   .. step:: Copy the MCP Server details into the configuration file

      At a minimum, copy the following lines into the configuration
      file:

      .. code-block:: none

         {
            "mcpServers": {
               "MongoDB": {
                  "command": "npx",
                  "args": ["-y", "mongodb-mcp-server"]
               }
            }
         }

   .. step:: (Optional) Set a database connection string

      You can also set a :ref:`database connection string <mongodb-uri>`
      in the configuration file, which allows Claude Desktop to perform
      operations on that database:

      .. code-block:: none
         :emphasize-lines: 5

         {
            "mcpServers": {
               "MongoDB": {
                  "command": "npx",
                  "args": ["-y", "mongodb-mcp-server", "--connectionString", "<connection-string>"]
               }
            }
         }
      
      To connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster:
      
      .. code-block:: none
         :emphasize-lines: 5

         {
            "mcpServers": {
               "MongoDB": {
                  "command": "npx",
                  "args": ["-y", "mongodb-mcp-server", "--connectionString", "mongodb+srv://<user-name>:<password>@<cluster-name>.mongodb.net/test"]
               }
            }
         }
 
      To connect to a MongoDB server running locally on port 27019 with
      a direct connection:

      .. code-block:: none
         :emphasize-lines: 5

         {
            "mcpServers": {
               "MongoDB": {
                  "command": "npx",
                  "args": ["-y", "mongodb-mcp-server", "--connectionString", "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27019/?directConnection=true"]
               }
            }
         }

   .. step:: Restart Claude Desktop and ensure the MongoDB MCP Server is found
      
      Close and start Claude Desktop. Then click the hammer
      icon in Claude Desktop. The MongoDB MCP Server should be found.
