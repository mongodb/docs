To ensure that you are using the latest |compass-short| features and
improvements, it is recommended to use the latest version of
|compass|. To upgrade |compass-short|, you can either
manually install the latest version or enable automatic updates.

Manually Install the Latest Version of Compass
----------------------------------------------

You can download and install the latest version of Compass from the
`MongoDB Downloads
<https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass?tck=docs_compass>`__ page at
any time. Check the :ref:`Software Requirements <software-reqs>` for
your operating system and desired version of Compass to ensure Compass
is compatible with your system. You do not need to uninstall previous
versions of Compass to upgrade.

.. note::

   If you are running macOS Catalina or later, you may have to modify
   your system settings to grant |compass-short| permission to run. For
   more information, see :ref:`compass-install`.

Enable Automatic Updates
------------------------

You can enable automatic updates to the latest version of Compass on the
:guilabel:`Help > Privacy Settings` dialog.

|compass| does not install any updates without your explicit permission.
Instead, |compass-short| prompts you to upgrade when a new version is
available.

.. _migrate-from-community:

Migrate to Compass from Compass Community
-----------------------------------------

To migrate from Compass Community edition to the fully-featured
edition of Compass and retain any saved data such as saved connection
strings and favorite queries, you must migrate that data to your
new edition of |compass|.

|compass| stores saved connections, queries, and aggregation pipelines
in folders in your file system. You can copy these folders to the
corresponding folder for your upgraded Compass version to avoid
recreating your saved data. 

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the fully-featured edition of |compass| from the
   {+download-page+}.

#. Refer to the following table to see where your |compass| data
   is stored based on your operating system:
