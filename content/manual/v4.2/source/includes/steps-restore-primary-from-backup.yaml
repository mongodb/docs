title: Obtain backup MongoDB Database files.
ref: obtain-backup-files
content: |
  The backup files may come from a :doc:`file system snapshot
  </tutorial/backup-with-filesystem-snapshots>`. The |mms-home|
  produces MongoDB database files for :mms-docs:`stored snapshots
  </tutorial/restore-from-snapshot/>` and :mms-docs:`point in time
  snapshots </tutorial/restore-from-point-in-time-snapshot/>`.
  For :products:`Ops Manager, an on-premise solution available in
  MongoDB Enterprise Advanced </mongodb-enterprise-advanced?tck=docs_server>`,

title: "Drop the ``local`` database if it exists in the backup."
ref: drop-local
pre: |
   If you are restoring from a filesystem backup (or any backup with
   the `local` database), drop the ``local`` database. 
action:
   - heading: Start a standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod` using the data files from the backup as the data path.
     language: sh
     code: |
        mongod --dbpath /data/db
   - heading: Drop the ``local`` database.
     pre: |
        Connect :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
        instance and drop the ``local`` database.
           
     language: javascript
     code: |
        use local
        db.dropDatabase()
     post: |
        Shut down the standalone.

title: "Start a new single-node replica set."
ref: restart-as-repl
pre: |
  Start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance as a new single-node replica set.
  Specify the path to the backup data files with ``--dbpath`` option
  and the replica set name with the ``--replSet`` option. 
  For :ref:`config server replica set (CSRS) <csrs>`,
  include the :option:`--configsvr <mongod --configsvr>` option.
  Include any other options as appropriate for your deployment.
  
  .. note::

     Starting in MongoDB 3.6, if your replica set members are run on
     different hosts or if you wish remote clients to connect to your
     instance, you must specify the :setting:`net.bindIp` setting (or
     :option:`--bind_ip <mongod --bind_ip>`).

  .. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

action:
  language: sh
  code: |
    mongod --dbpath /data/db --replSet <replName>

title: Initiate the new replica set.
ref: initiate
pre: |
  Use :method:`rs.initiate()` on *one and only one* member of the replica set:
action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    rs.initiate( {
       _id : <replName>,
       members: [ { _id : 0, host : <host:port> } ]
    })
post: |
  MongoDB initiates a set that consists of the current member and that
  uses the default replica set configuration.
