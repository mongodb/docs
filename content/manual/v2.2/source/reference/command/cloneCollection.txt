.. dbcommand:: cloneCollection

   The :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` command copies a collection from a
   remote server to the server where you run the
   command. :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` does not allow you to clone a
   collection through a :binary:`~bin.mongos`: you must connect directly
   to the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

   :param from:

      Specify a resolvable hostname, and optional port number
      of the remote server where the specified collection resides.

   :param query:

      Optional. A query document, in the form of a :term:`document`,
      that filters the documents in the remote collection that
      :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` will copy to the current
      database. See :method:`db.collection.find()`.

   :param Boolean copyIndexes:

      Optional. ``true`` by default. When set to ``false`` the indexes
      on the originating server are *not* copied with the documents in
      the collection.

   Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { cloneCollection: "users.profiles", from: "mongodb.example.net:27017", query: { active: true }, copyIndexes: false }

   This operation copies the ``profiles`` collection from the
   ``users`` database on the server at ``mongodb.example.net``. The operation only
   copies documents that satisfy the query ``{ active: true }`` and
   does not copy indexes. :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` copies indexes
   by default, but you can disable this behavior by setting ``{
   copyIndexes: false }``. The ``query`` and ``copyIndexes``
   arguments are optional.

   :dbcommand:`cloneCollection` creates a collection on the current
   database with the same name as the origin collection. If, in the
   above example, the ``profiles`` collection already exists in the local
   database, then MongoDB appends documents in the remote collection
   to the destination collection.
