ref: watch-option-batchSize
content: |
  The maximum number of documents within each batch returned in a query result, which applies 
  to the ``aggregate`` command. By default, the ``aggregate`` command has an initial batch size of 
  ``101`` documents and a maximum size of 16 mebibytes (MiB) for each subsequent batch. This
  option can enforce a smaller limit than 16 MiB, but not a larger one. If you set ``batchSize`` 
  to a limit that results in batches larger than 16 MiB, this option has no effect.
---
ref: watch-option-fullDocument
content: |
  Determines how the ``fullDocument`` response field will be populated for
  update operations.

  By default, change streams only return the delta of fields (via an
  ``updateDescription`` field) for update operations and ``fullDocument`` is
  omitted. Insert and replace operations always include the ``fullDocument``
  field. Delete operations omit the field as the document no longer exists.

  Specify "updateLookup" to return the current majority-committed version of the
  updated document.

  MongoDB 6.0+ allows returning the post-image of the modified document if the
  collection has ``changeStreamPreAndPostImages`` enabled. Specify
  "whenAvailable" to return the post-image if available or a null value if not.
  Specify "required" to return the post-image if available or raise an error if
  not.

  The following values are supported:

  - ``MongoDB\Operation\Watch::FULL_DOCUMENT_UPDATE_LOOKUP``
  - ``MongoDB\Operation\Watch::FULL_DOCUMENT_WHEN_AVAILABLE``
  - ``MongoDB\Operation\Watch::FULL_DOCUMENT_REQUIRED``

  This is an option of the ``$changeStream`` pipeline stage.
---
ref: watch-option-fullDocumentBeforeChange
content: |
  Determines how the ``fullDocumentBeforeChange`` response field will be
  populated. By default, the field is omitted.

  MongoDB 6.0+ allows returning the pre-image of the modified document if the
  collection has ``changeStreamPreAndPostImages`` enabled. Specify
  "whenAvailable" to return the pre-image if available or a null value if not.
  Specify "required" to return the pre-image if available or raise an error if
  not.

  The following values are supported:

  - ``MongoDB\Operation\Watch::FULL_DOCUMENT_BEFORE_CHANGE_WHEN_AVAILABLE``
  - ``MongoDB\Operation\Watch::FULL_DOCUMENT_BEFORE_CHANGE_REQUIRED``

  This is an option of the ``$changeStream`` pipeline stage.

ref: watch-option-maxAwaitTimeMS
content: |
  Positive integer denoting the time limit in milliseconds for the server to
  block a getMore operation if no data is available.
---
ref: watch-option-resumeAfter
content: |
  Specifies the logical starting point for the new change stream. The ``_id``
  field in documents returned by the change stream may be used here.

  Using this option in conjunction with ``startAfter`` and/or
  ``startAtOperationTime`` will result in a server error. The options are
  mutually exclusive.

  This is an option of the ``$changeStream`` pipeline stage.
---
ref: watch-option-showExpandedEvents
content: |
  If true, instructs the server to include additional DDL events in the change
  stream. The additional events that may be included are:

  - ``createIndexes``
  - ``dropIndexes``
  - ``modify``
  - ``create``
  - ``shardCollection``
  - ``reshardCollection`` (server 6.1+)
  - ``refineCollectionShardKey`` (server 6.1+)

  This is not supported for server versions prior to 6.0 and will result in an
  exception at execution time if used.

  This is an option of the ``$changeStream`` pipeline stage.

  .. versionadded:: 1.13
---
ref: watch-option-startAfter
content: |
  Specifies the logical starting point for the new change stream. The ``_id``
  field in documents returned by the change stream may be used here. Unlike
  ``resumeAfter``, this option can be used with a resume token from an
  "invalidate" event.

  Using this option in conjunction with ``resumeAfter`` and/or
  ``startAtOperationTime`` will result in a server error. The options are
  mutually exclusive.

  This is not supported for server versions prior to 4.2 and will result in an
  exception at execution time if used.

  This is an option of the ``$changeStream`` pipeline stage.

  .. versionadded:: 1.5
---
ref: watch-option-startAtOperationTime
content: |
  If specified, the change stream will only provide changes that occurred at or
  after the specified timestamp. Command responses from a MongoDB 4.0+ server
  include an ``operationTime`` that can be used here. By default, the
  ``operationTime`` returned by the initial ``aggregate`` command will be used
  if available.

  Using this option in conjunction with ``resumeAfter`` and/or ``startAfter``
  will result in a server error. The options are mutually exclusive.

  This is not supported for server versions prior to 4.0 and will result in an
  exception at execution time if used.

  This is an option of the ``$changeStream`` pipeline stage.
