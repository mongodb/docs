Replica Set Members
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

A *replica set* in MongoDB is a group of :program:`mongod` processes
that provide redundancy and high availability. The members of a
replica set are:

:ref:`replica-set-primary-member`.
   The *primary* receives all write operations.

:ref:`replica-set-secondary-members`. 
   Secondaries replicate operations from the primary to maintain an
   identical data set. Secondaries may have additional configurations
   for special usage profiles. For example, secondaries may be
   :ref:`non-voting <replica-set-non-voting-members>` or
   :ref:`priority 0 <replica-set-secondary-only-members>`.

You can also maintain an :ref:`arbiter <replica-set-arbiters>` as part
of a replica set. Arbiters do not keep a copy of the data. However,
arbiters play a role in the elections that select a primary if the
current primary is unavailable.

A replica set can have up to 12 members. [#master-slave]_ However, only
7 members can vote at a time. 

The minimum requirements for a replica set are: A :ref:`primary
<replica-set-primary-member>`, a :ref:`secondary
<replica-set-secondary-members>`, and an :ref:`arbiter
<replica-set-arbiters>`. Most deployments, however, will keep three
members that store data: A :ref:`primary <replica-set-primary-member>`
and two :ref:`secondary members <replica-set-secondary-members>`.
