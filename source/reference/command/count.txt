Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: count

   Counts the number of documents in a collection or a view. Returns a
   document that contains this count and as well as the command status.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`~db.collection.count`  helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

   .. note::

      MongoDB drivers compatible with the 4.0 features deprecate their
      respective cursor and collection ``count()`` APIs (which runs the
      :dbcommand:`count` command) in favor of new APIs that corresponds to
      ``countDocuments()`` and ``estimatedDocumentCount()``. For the
      specific API names for a given driver, see the driver API
      documentation.

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/4.2-changes-count-syntax-validation.rst

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
        count: <collection or view>,
        query: <document>,
        limit: <integer>,
        skip: <integer>,
        hint: <hint>,
        readConcern: <document>,
        maxTimeMS: <integer>,
        collation: <document>,
        comment: <any>
      }
   )

Stable API Support
------------------

Starting in MongoDB 6.0, the ``count`` command is included in
:ref:`Stable API <stable-api>` V1. To use the ``count`` command in the
Stable API, you must connect your driver to a deployment that is running
MongoDB 6.0 or greater.

Behavior
--------

.. _count-command-behavior-query-predicate:

Inaccurate Counts Without Query Predicate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you call :dbcommand:`count` without a query predicate, you may
receive inaccurate document counts. Without a query predicate,
:dbcommand:`count` commands return results based on the collection's
metadata, which may result in an approximate count. In particular,

- On a sharded cluster, the resulting count will not correctly
  filter out :term:`orphaned documents <orphaned document>`.

- After an unclean shutdown or :ref:`file copy based initial sync
  <replica-set-initial-sync-file-copy-based>`, the count may be
  incorrect.

For counts based on collection metadata, see also
:ref:`collStats pipeline stage with the count <collstat-count>`
option.

Count and Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-uncommitted-transactions.rst

.. |countMethod| replace:: :dbcommand:`count`

For details, see :ref:`Transactions and Count Operations
<transactions-ops-count>`.

Accuracy and Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _count-accuracy-shutdown:

Accuracy after Unexpected Shutdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |cmd| replace:: :dbcommand:`count`
.. |opt| replace:: count

.. include:: /includes/fact-unexpected-shutdown-accuracy.rst

.. note:: 
   This loss of accuracy only applies to :dbcommand:`count`
   operations that do *not* include a query document.

Examples
--------

The following sections provide examples of the :dbcommand:`count`
command.

Count All Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation counts the number of all documents in the
``orders`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { count: 'orders' } )

In the result, the ``n``, which represents the count, is ``26``,
and the command status ``ok`` is ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "n" : 26, "ok" : 1 }

Count Documents That Match a Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation returns a count of the documents in the
``orders`` collection where the value of the ``ord_dt`` field is
greater than ``Date('01/01/2012')``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { count:'orders',
                    query: { ord_dt: { $gt: new Date('01/01/2012') } }
                  } )

In the result, the ``n``, which represents the count, is ``13``
and the command status ``ok`` is ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "n" : 13, "ok" : 1 }

Skip Documents in Count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation returns a count of the documents in the
``orders`` collection where the value of the ``ord_dt`` field is
greater than ``Date('01/01/2012')`` and skip the first ``10`` matching
documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { count:'orders',
                    query: { ord_dt: { $gt: new Date('01/01/2012') } },
                    skip: 10 }  )

In the result, the ``n``, which represents the count, is ``3`` and
the command status ``ok`` is ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "n" : 3, "ok" : 1 }

Specify the Index to Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operation uses the index ``{ status: 1 }`` to return a
count of the documents in the ``orders`` collection where the value of
the ``ord_dt`` field is greater than ``Date('01/01/2012')`` and the
``status`` field is equal to ``"D"``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
        count:'orders',
        query: {
                 ord_dt: { $gt: new Date('01/01/2012') },
                 status: "D"
               },
        hint: { status: 1 }
      }
   )

In the result, the ``n``, which represents the count, is ``1`` and
the command status ``ok`` is ``1``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "n" : 1, "ok" : 1 }
   
Override Default Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To override the default read concern level of :readconcern:`"local"`,
use the ``readConcern`` option.

The following operation on a replica set specifies a
:doc:`/reference/read-concern` of :readconcern:`"majority"` to read the
most recent copy of the data confirmed as having been written to a
majority of the nodes.

.. important::

   - To use the ``readConcern`` level of ``"majority"``, you must specify
     a nonempty ``query`` condition.

   - .. include:: /includes/fact-readConcern-most-recent-data-in-node.rst

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
        count: "restaurants",
        query: { rating: { $gte: 4 } },
        readConcern: { level: "majority" }
      }
   )
