  a. Enter the following URL in a browser, where ``<host>`` is the fully
     qualified domain name of **server 1**:

     .. code-block:: none

        http://<host>:8080

  b. Click the :guilabel:`Register` link and follow the prompts to register
     the first user and create the first group. The first user is

stepnum: 6
level: 4
ref: configure-app
content: |
  |onprem| walks you through several configuration pages. Required settings
  are marked with an asterisk. Enter information as appropriate. For more
  information on a setting, see :doc:`/reference/configuration`. When
  configuration is complete, |onprem| opens the :guilabel:`Deployment` page.
---
title: "Copy the ``gen.key`` file from the **server 1** to **server 2**."
stepnum: 7
level: 4
ref: sync-genkey
pre: |
  |onprem| requires an identical :ref:`gen-key` file be stored on both
  servers running |onprem| and uses the file to encrypt data at rest in the
  |onprem| Application Database and Backup Database.

  Use ``scp`` to copy the ``gen.key`` file from the ``/etc/mongodb-mms/``
  directory on **server 1** to the ``/etc/mongodb-mms/`` directory on
  **server 2**. You must copy the ``gen.key`` file before starting |onprem|
  on **server 2**.

title: "Enable the Backup Daemon."
stepnum: 8
level: 4
ref: enable-backup-daemon
content: |
  a. On **server 2**, create the directory that will store the :term:`head
     databases <head database>`. The directory must be:

     - a dedicated disk partition that is not be used for any other
       purpose.

     - sized appropriately according to the :doc:`/core/requirements`.

     - writable by the ``mongodb-mms`` user.

  b. Open |onprem| and make sure you are logged in as the user you
     registered when installing |onprem|. This user is the :ref:`global
     owner <global-owner-role>`.

  c. Click the :guilabel:`Admin` link at the top right of the page.

  d. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

  e. Follow the prompts to configure the Backup Daemon and Backup Storage.

     .. warning::

        Once the connection string is saved, any change to the string requires
        you to restart all |onprem| instances, including those running
        enabled Backup Daemons. Making the change and clicking
        :guilabel:`Save` is not sufficient. |onprem| will continue to use the
        previous string until you restart the instances.

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 35 65

        * - :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>`

          - Enter a comma-separated list of the fully qualified domain
            names and port numbers for all :term:`replica set` members for
            the Backup Database.

        * - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Username` and

            :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`

          - Enter the user credentials if the database uses
            authentication.

        * - :guilabel:`Encrypted Credentials`

          - Check this if the user credentials use the |onprem|
            ``credentialstool``. For more information, see
            :ref:`encrypt-mongodb-user-credentials`.

        * - :guilabel:`Use SSL`

          - Check this if the database uses SSL. If you select this, you
            must configure SSL settings |onprem|. See
            :doc:`/reference/configuration`.

        * - :guilabel:`Connection Options`

          - To add additional connection options, enter them using the
            MongoDB :manual:`Connection String URI Format
            </reference/connection-string>`.
