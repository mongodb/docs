You must create a database user to access your cluster. For
security purposes, |cloudgov-short| requires clients to authenticate 
as MongoDB database users to access clusters.

Database users are separate from |cloudgov-short| users:

- Database users can access databases hosted in |cloudgov-short|.

- |cloudgov-short| users can log in to |cloudgov| but do not have 
  access to MongoDB databases.

-----------------------------------

Database users who authenticate with 
:manual:`SCRAM </core/security-scram/>` must use ``SCRAM-SHA-256``.

Procedure
---------

To add a ``SCRAM-SHA-256``-authenticated database user to your cluster:

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-mongodb-user.rst

.. seealso:: |service| documentation

   To learn more about configuring database users or to add a user with 
   an alternative authentication method, see :atlas:`Configure Database Users </security-add-mongodb-users/>`.

Next steps
----------

As a database user, you can 
:ref:`connect to your cluster <connect-to-cluster>`.
