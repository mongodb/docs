|service-fullname| supports a variety of authentication methods to
ensure robust security. |service| requires all users to authenticate to 
access the {+atlas-ui+}, |service| databases, and  the {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. note:: 

   In this context, a "user" can be a human or an application. We refer to 
   human users as "Workforce Identity" and applications as "Workload Identity".

Two factors determine which authentication types to use: 

- The identity type (human or machine)
- The resource that the identity needs access to. The resource can be one
  of the following: |service| UI, |service| Database, or |service| APIs.

|service| UI Authentication
---------------------------

- Workforce Users

  Use IP access restrictions, and then:

  - Use :ref:`Federated Authentication <arch-center-federated_auth>` with an 
    SAML 2.0 identity provider, such as Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, or Ping 
    Identity, **and** 
  - Use Atlas credentials with 
    :ref:`Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) <arch-center-mfa>`. You should 
    always use the most secure form of MFA available, such as a hardware key 
    or biometrics.

- Workload Users
  
  This only applies to Workforce users.

|service| Database Authentication
---------------------------------

- Workforce Users

  Use :ref:`Workforce Identity Federation <arch-center-workforce_if>`.

  For development and test environments, you can also use 
  :ref:`SCRAM <arch-center-scram>`. Consider :ref:`creating temporary database 
  users <arch-center-just-in-time>` with just-in-time database access.

- Workload Users

  Use one of the following:

  - :ref:`Workload Identity Federation <arch-center-workload_if>`
  - :ref:`AWS-IAM authentication <arch-center-iam>`
  - :ref:`X.509 <arch-center-x509>` certificates

  For development and test environments, you can also use 
  :ref:`X.509 <arch-center-x509>` certificates or :ref:`SCRAM <arch-center-scram>`.

|service| API Authentication
----------------------------

.. note::

   This applies to both Workforce and Workload users.

Use :ref:`<arch-center-admin-service-accounts>`. 
For development and test environments, you can also use 
:ref:`<arch-center-admin-service-accounts>` or :ref:`<arch-center-admin-api-keys>`.

Authentication Types
--------------------

The following sections provide details about the authentication methods used when 
accessing the {+atlas-ui+}, |service| Database, or the {+atlas-admin-api+}.

.. _arch-center-federated_auth:

Federated Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Federated authentication allows you to manage all authentication to
the {+atlas-ui+} across multiple systems and applications through a
central identity provider, which reduces user management complexity. With 
federated authentication, you can enforce security policies such as password 
complexity, credential rotation, and :abbr:`MFA (Multi-Factor
Authentication)` within your identity provider's tools. 

For the {+atlas-ui+}, you can use any :abbr:`SAML (Security Assertion
Markup Language) 2.0` compatible identity provider such as Okta, Microsoft
Entra ID, or Ping Identity.

.. _arch-center-workforce_if:

Workforce Identity Federation
`````````````````````````````

Workforce Identity Federation allows you to manage all authentication to 
the |service| database through your identity provider. To learn more, 
see :ref:`oidc-authentication-workforce`.

.. _arch-center-workload_if:

Workload Identity Federation
````````````````````````````

Workload Identity Federation enables applications running in cloud
environments like |azure| and Google Cloud to authenticate with
|service| without the need to manage separate database user credentials.
With Workload Identity Federation, you can manage |service| database
users using |azure| Managed Identities, Google Service Accounts, or any
OAuth 2.0-compliant service. These authentication mechanisms simplify
management and enhance security by allowing for passwordless access to
the |service| database. 

.. _arch-center-iam:

AWS IAM Role Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also authenticate through |aws| |iam| roles. To learn more, 
see :ref:`set-up-pwdless-auth`.

To learn more, see :ref:`oidc-authentication-workload` and 
:ref:`atlas-federated-authentication`.

.. _arch-center-mfa:

Multi-Factor Authentication 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For any human user that has access to the |service| control plane, we **require** 
:abbr:`MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)` for enhanced security. |service| 
supports the following MFA methods as secondary identification: 

- Security keys
- Biometrics
- OTP authenticators 
- Push notifications with Okta Verify
- Email

.. note::
   
   If you are using Federated Auth, you configure and manage MFA in the 
   :abbr:`IdP (Identity Provider)`. If you are using |service| credentials, 
   MFA is configured and managed within |service|. MFA is required when 
   using |service| credentials.

To learn more, see :ref:`atlas-enable-mfa`.

.. _arch-center-x509:

X.509 Client Certificates 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

X.509 certificates provide the security of mutual TLS, 
making them suitable for staging and production environments, and you
can bring your own certificate authority for use with X.509.
The disadvantage of X.509 is that you must manage certificates and
the security of these certificates on the application side, while
Workload Identity Federation allows for password-less access and easier
application security.

To learn more, see :manual:`X.509 </core/security-x.509/>`.

.. _arch-center-scram:

SCRAM Password Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| clusters support SCRAM password authentication for user authentication, 
but we recommend SCRAM only for use in development and test environments. 

If you leverage X.509 or SCRAM authentication, we recommend that you use 
a third-party secrets manager like 
`HashiCorp Vault <https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/databases/mongodbatlas>`__
or |aws| Secrets Manager to generate and store complex database credentials. 

To learn more, see :manual:`SCRAM </core/security-scram/>`.

.. _arch-center-admin-service-accounts:

Service Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Service accounts use industry-standard OAuth2.0 to securely authenticate
with {+service+} through the {+atlas-admin-api+}. We recommend that you use 
service accounts instead of |api| keys when possible because they provide added 
security through short-lived access tokens and required credential rotations.

You can manage programmatic access for service accounts by using the 
{+atlas-ui+}, {+atlas-cli+}, {+atlas-admin-api+}, and Terraform.

.. _arch-center-admin-api-keys:

API Keys
~~~~~~~~

Service accounts are the preferred method of authentication. {+service+}  
provides legacy support for |api| key-based authentication for managing 
programmatic access. |api| key-based authentication uses |http| Digest 
authentication to protect requests.

To further enhance security and minimize the risk of unauthorized 
access:

- Follow best practices for rotating API keys regularly. To learn how 
  to rotate these keys with `HashiCorp Vault 
  <https://www.vaultproject.io/>`__, for example, see the 
  `Hashicorp documentation 
  <https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/mongodbatlas>`__.

- Use the IP access list for your API keys. To learn more, see 
  :atlas:`Require an IP Access List for the Atlas Administration API </configure-api-access/#optional--require-an-ip-access-list-for-the-atlas-administration-api>`.

To learn more, see :ref:`api-authentication`.

.. _arch-center-secrets:

Secrets Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend using a third-party secrets manager like `HashiCorp Vault
<https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/databases/mongodbatlas>`__
or |aws| Secrets Manager to generate and store complex database credentials.
A secrets manager can generate database credentials dynamically based on configured
roles for |service| databases. 

To learn more, see the blog :website:`Manage
MongoDB Atlas Database Secrets in HashiCorp Vault 
</blog/post/manage-atlas-database-secrets-hashicorp-vault>`.

Additional Security Measures
----------------------------

To further enhance security and minimize the risk of unauthorized access, 
consider these additional security measures:

- :atlas:`Rotate service account secrets </tutorial/rotate-service-account-secrets/#std-label-rotate-service-account-secrets>` before they expire.

- Use an :atlas:`IP access list </configure-api-access/#optional--require-an-ip-access-list-for-the-atlas-administration-api>` for your service accounts.

- Assign the least privileged :atlas:`Atlas role </reference/user-roles/>` required for the service account's intended purpose to adhere to the principle of least privilege.

To learn more, see :atlas:`Service Accounts Overview </api/api-authentication/>`.
