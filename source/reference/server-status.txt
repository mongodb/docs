Server Status Reference
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. When adding status fields to this document, make sure that the
   ``docs/source/reference/server-status-index.txt`` document also
   reflects those changes.

The :dbcommand:`serverStatus` command returns a collection of information that
reflects the database's status. These data are useful for diagnosing
and assessing the performance of your MongoDB instance. This reference
catalogs each datum included in the output of this command and
provides context for using this data to more effectively administer
your database.

.. seealso:: Much of the output of :dbcommand:`serverStatus` is also
   displayed dynamically by :program:`mongostat`. See the
   :doc:`/reference/mongostat` command for more information.

   For examples of the :dbcommand:`serverStatus` output, see
   :doc:`/reference/server-status-index`.

   The :data:`~serverStatus.locks` document contains sub-documents that provides a
   granular report on MongoDB database-level lock use. All values are
   of the ``NumberLong()`` type.

   Generally, fields named:

   - ``R`` refer to the global read lock,
   - ``W`` refer to the global write lock,
   - ``r`` refer to the database specific read lock, and
   - ``w`` refer to the database specific write lock.

   If a document does not have any fields, it means that no locks have
   existed with this context since the last time the :program:`mongod`
   started.

   database.

.. data:: serverStatus.locks.<database>

   For each additional database :data:`~serverStatus.locks` includes a document
   that reports on the lock use for this database. The names of these
   documents reflect the database name itself.

.. data:: serverStatus.locks.<database>.timeLockedMicros

   The :data:`~serverStatus.locks.<database>.timeLockedMicros` document reports on the amount
   of time in microseconds that locks have existed in the context of
   the ``<database>`` database.

.. data:: serverStatus.locks.<database>.timeLockedMicros.r

   The ``r`` field reports the amount of time in microseconds that the
   ``<database>`` database has held the read lock.

.. data:: serverStatus.locks.<database>.timeLockedMicros.w

.. _globallock:
.. _global-lock:
.. _server-status-globallock:
.. _server-status-global-lock:

globalLock
----------

.. example:: :ref:`output of the globalLock fields <server-status-example-globallock>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock

   The :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock` data structure contains information regarding
   the database's current lock state, historical lock status, current
   operation queue, and the number of active clients.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime` represents the time, in
   microseconds, since the database last started and creation of the
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock`. This is roughly equivalent to total server
   uptime.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.lockTime

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.lockTime` represents the time, in
   microseconds, since the database last started, that the
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock` has been *held*.

   Consider this value in combination with the value of
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime`. MongoDB aggregates these values in
   the :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.ratio` value. If the
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.ratio` value is small but
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime` is high the :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock` has
   typically been held frequently for shorter periods of time, which
   may be indicative of a more normal use pattern. If the
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.lockTime` is higher and the
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime` is smaller (relatively,) then fewer
   operations are responsible for a greater portion of server's use
   (relatively.)

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.ratio

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.ratio` was removed. See :data:`~serverStatus.locks`.

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.ratio` displays the relationship between
   :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.lockTime` and :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.totalTime`.

   Low values indicate that operations have held the :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock`
   frequently for shorter periods of time. High values indicate that
   operations have held :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock` infrequently for longer periods of
   time.

.. _globallock-currentqueue:

globalLock.currentQueue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue

   The :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue` data structure value provides more
   granular information concerning the number of operations queued
   because of a lock.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.total

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.total` provides a combined
   total of operations queued waiting for the lock.

   A consistently small queue, particularly of shorter operations
   should cause no concern. Also, consider this value in light of the
   size of queue waiting for the read lock
   (e.g. :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.readers`) and write-lock
   (e.g. :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.writers`) individually.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.readers

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.readers` is the number of
   operations that are currently queued and waiting for the
   read-lock. A consistently small read-queue, particularly of
   shorter operations should cause no concern.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.writers

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.currentQueue.writers` is the number of
   operations that are currently queued and waiting for the
   write-lock. A consistently small write-queue, particularly of
   shorter operations is no cause for concern.

globalLock.activeClients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients

   The :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients` data structure provides more
   granular information about the number of connected clients and the
   operation types (e.g. read or write) performed by these clients.

   Use this data to provide context for the :ref:`currentQueue
   <globallock-currentqueue>` data.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.total

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.total` is the total number
   of active client connections to the database. This combines clients
   that are performing read operations
   (e.g. :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.readers`) and clients that
   are performing write operations (e.g. :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.writers`).

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.readers

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.readers` contains a count
   of the active client connections performing read operations.

.. data:: serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.writers

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.globalLock.activeClients.writers` contains a count
   of active client connections performing write operations.

.. _memory-status:
.. _server-status-memory:

mem
---

.. example:: :ref:`output of the memory fields <server-status-example-memory>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem

   The :data:`~serverStatus.mem` data structure holds information regarding the target
   system architecture of :program:`mongod` and current memory use.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.bits

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.bits` is either ``64`` or ``32``,
   depending on which target architecture specified during the
   :program:`mongod` compilation process. In most instances this is
   ``64``, and this value does not change over time.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.resident

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.resident` is roughly equivalent to the amount
   of RAM, in megabytes (MB), currently used by the database process. In normal
   use this value tends to grow. In dedicated database servers this
   number tends to approach the total amount of system memory.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.virtual

   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.virtual` displays the quantity, in megabytes (MB), of virtual memory
   used by the :program:`mongod` process. In typical deployments this value
   is slightly larger than :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped`. If this value is
   significantly (i.e. gigabytes) larger than :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped`,
   this could indicate a memory leak.

   With :term:`journaling <journal>` enabled, the value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.virtual`
   is twice the value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped`.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.supported

   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.supported` is true when the underlying system supports
   extended memory information. If this value is false and the system
   does not support extended memory information, then other
   :data:`~serverStatus.mem` values may not be accessible to the database server.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.mapped

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped` provides the amount of mapped memory,
   in megabytes (MB), by
   the database. Because MongoDB uses memory-mapped files, this value
   is likely to be to be roughly equivalent to the total size of your
   database or databases.

.. data:: serverStatus.mem.mappedWithJournal

   :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mappedWithJournal` provides the amount of
   mapped memory, in megabytes (MB), including the memory used for
   journaling.
   This value will always be twice the value of :data:`~serverStatus.mem.mapped`.
   This field is only included if journaling is enabled.

.. _server-status-connections:

connections
-----------

.. example:: :ref:`output of the connections fields <server-status-example-connections>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.connections

   The :data:`~serverStatus.connections` sub document data regarding the
   current connection status and availability of the database
   server. Use these values to asses the current load and capacity
   requirements of the server.

.. data:: serverStatus.connections.current

   The value of :data:`~serverStatus.connections.current` corresponds to the number of
   connections to the database server from clients. This number
   includes the current shell session. Consider the value of
   :data:`~serverStatus.connections.available` to add more context to this
   datum.

   This figure will include the current shell connection as well as
   any inter-node connections to support a :term:`replica set` or
   :term:`sharded cluster`.

.. data:: serverStatus.connections.available

   :data:`~serverStatus.connections.available` provides a count of the number of unused
   available connections that the database can provide. Consider this
   value in combination with the value of
   :data:`~serverStatus.connections.current` to understand the connection load on
   the database, and the :doc:`/administration/ulimit` document for
   more information about system thresholds on available connections.

.. _server-status-extra-info:
.. _server-status-extra_info:
.. _server-status-extrainfo:

extra_info
----------

.. example:: :ref:`output of the extra_info fields <server-status-example-extrainfo>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.extra_info

   The :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info` data structure holds data collected by the
   :program:`mongod` instance about the underlying system. Your system may
   only report a subset of these fields.

.. data:: serverStatus.extra_info.note

   The field :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info.note` reports that the data in this
   structure depend on the underlying platform, and has the text:
   "fields vary by platform."

.. data:: serverStatus.extra_info.heap_usage_bytes

   The :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info.heap_usage_bytes` field is only available on
   Unix/Linux systems, and reports the total size in bytes of heap space
   used by the database process.

.. data:: serverStatus.extra_info.page_faults

   The :data:`~serverStatus.extra_info.page_faults` field is only available on Unix/Linux
   systems, and reports the total number of page faults that require
   disk operations. Page faults refer to operations that require the
   database server to access data which isn't available in active
   memory. The :data:`~serverStatus.page_fault.extra_info.page_faults` counter may increase dramatically during
   moments of poor performance and may correlate with limited
   memory environments and larger data sets. Limited and sporadic page
   faults do not necessarily indicate an issue.

.. _server-status-indexcounters:

indexCounters
-------------

.. example:: :ref:`output of the indexCounters fields <server-status-example-indexcounters>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.indexCounters

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      Previously, data in the :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters` document
      reported sampled data, and were only useful in relative
      comparison to each other, because they could not reflect
      absolute index use. In 2.2 and later, these data reflect actual
      index use.

   The :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters` data structure reports information
   regarding the state and use of indexes in MongoDB.

.. data:: serverStatus.indexCounters.btree

   The :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.btree` data structure contains data
   regarding MongoDB's :term:`btree` indexes.

.. data:: serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.accesses

   :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.accesses` reports the number of times
   that operations have accessed indexes. This value is the
   combination of the :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.hits` and
   :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.misses`. Higher values indicate that
   your database has indexes and that queries are taking advantage of
   these indexes. If this number does not grow over time, this might
   indicate that your indexes do not effectively support your use.

.. data:: serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.hits

   The :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.hits` value reflects the number of
   times that an index has been accessed and :program:`mongod` is able
   to return the index from memory.

   A higher value indicates effective index
   use. :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.hits` values that represent a
   greater proportion of the :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.accesses`
   value, tend to indicate more effective index configuration.

.. data:: serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.misses

   The :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.misses` value represents the
   number of times that an operation attempted to access an index that
   was not in memory. These "misses," do not indicate a failed query
   or operation, but rather an inefficient use of the index. Lower
   values in this field indicate better index use and likely overall
   performance as well.

.. data:: serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.resets

   The :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.resets` value reflects the number
   of times that the index counters have been reset since the database
   last restarted. Typically this value is ``0``, but use this value
   to provide context for the data specified by other
   :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters` values.

.. data:: serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.missRatio

   The :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.missRatio` value is the ratio of
   :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.hits` to
   :data:`~serverStatus.indexCounters.btree.misses` misses. This value is
   typically ``0`` or approaching ``0``.

.. _server-status-backgroundflushing:
.. _server-status-background-flushing:

backgroundFlushing
------------------

.. example:: :ref:`output of the backgroundFlushing fields <server-status-example-backgroundflushing>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing

   :program:`mongod` periodically flushes writes to disk. In the default
   configuration, this happens every 60 seconds. The
   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing` data structure contains data regarding
   these operations. Consider these values if you have concerns about
   write performance and :ref:`journaling <journaling-status>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.flushes

   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.flushes` is a counter that collects the
   number of times the database has flushed all writes to disk. This
   value will grow as database runs for longer periods of time.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.total_ms

   The :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.total_ms` value provides the total number
   of milliseconds (ms) that the :program:`mongod` processes have spent
   writing (i.e. flushing) data to disk. Because this is an absolute
   value, consider the value of :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.flushes`
   and :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.average_ms` to provide better
   context for this datum.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.average_ms

   The :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.average_ms` value describes the
   relationship between the number of flushes and the total amount of
   time that the database has spent writing data to disk. The larger
   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.flushes` is, the more likely this value
   is likely to represent a "normal," time; however, abnormal data can
   skew this value.

   Use the :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_ms` to ensure that a high
   average is not skewed by transient historical issue or a
   random write distribution.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_ms

   The value of the :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_ms` field is the amount
   of time, in milliseconds, that the last flush operation took to
   complete. Use this value to verify that the current performance of
   the server and is in line with the historical data provided by
   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.average_ms` and
   :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.total_ms`.

.. data:: serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_finished

   The :data:`~serverStatus.backgroundFlushing.last_finished` field provides a timestamp
   of the last completed flush operation in the :term:`ISODate`
   format. If this value is more than a few minutes old relative to
   your server's current time and accounting for differences in time
   zone, restarting the database may result in some data loss.

   Also consider ongoing operations that might skew this value by
   routinely block write operations.

.. _server-status-cursors:

cursors
-------

.. example:: :ref:`output of the cursors <server-status-example-cursors>` fields.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors

   The :data:`~serverStatus.cursors` data structure contains data regarding cursor state
   and use.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.totalOpen

   :data:`~serverStatus.cursors.totalOpen` provides the number of cursors that
   MongoDB is maintaining for clients. Because MongoDB exhausts unused
   cursors, typically this value small or zero. However, if there is a
   queue, stale tailable cursors, or a large number of operations this
   value may rise.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.clientCursors_size

   .. deprecated:: 1.x
      See :data:`~serverStatus.cursors.totalOpen` for this datum.

.. data:: serverStatus.cursors.timedOut

   :data:`~serverStatus.cursors.timedOut` provides a counter of the total number
   of cursors that have timed out since the server process started. If
   this number is large or growing at a regular rate, this may
   indicate an application error.

.. _server-status-network:

network
-------

.. example:: :ref:`output of the network fields <server-status-example-network>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.network

   The :data:`~serverStatus.network` data structure contains data regarding MongoDB's
   network use.

.. data:: serverStatus.network.bytesIn

   The value of the :data:`~serverStatus.network.bytesIn` field reflects the
   amount of network traffic, in bytes, received *by* this
   database. Use this value to ensure that network traffic sent to the
   :program:`mongod` process is consistent with expectations and
   overall inter-application traffic.

.. data:: serverStatus.network.bytesOut

   The value of the :data:`~serverStatus.network.bytesOut` field reflects the amount of
   network traffic, in bytes, sent *from* this database. Use this
   value to ensure that network traffic sent by the :program:`mongod` process
   is consistent with expectations and overall inter-application
   traffic.

.. data:: serverStatus.network.numRequests

   The :data:`~serverStatus.network.numRequests` field is a counter of the total number
   of distinct requests that the server has received. Use this value
   to provide context for the :data:`~serverStatus.network.bytesIn` and
   :data:`~serverStatus.network.bytesOut` values to ensure that MongoDB's network
   utilization is consistent with expectations and application use.

.. _server-status-repl:

repl
----

.. example:: :ref:`output of the repl fields <server-status-example-repl>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.repl

   The :data:`~serverStatus.repl` data structure contains status information for
   MongoDB's replication (i.e. "replica set") configuration. These
   values only appear when the current host has replication enabled.

   See :doc:`/core/replication` for more information on replication.

.. data:: serverStatus.repl.setName

   The :data:`~serverStatus.repl.setName` field contains a string with the name of the
   current replica set. This value reflects the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`
   command line argument, or :setting:`replSet` value in the
   configuration file.

   See :doc:`/core/replication` for more information on replication.

.. data:: serverStatus.repl.ismaster

   The value of the :data:`~serverStatus.repl.ismaster` field is either ``true`` or
   ``false`` and reflects whether the current node is the master or
   primary node in the replica set.

   See :doc:`/core/replication` for more information on replication.

.. data:: serverStatus.repl.secondary

   The value of the :data:`~serverStatus.repl.secondary` field is either ``true`` or
   ``false`` and reflects whether the current node is a secondary
   node in the replica set.

   See :doc:`/core/replication` for more information on replication.

.. data:: serverStatus.repl.hosts

   :data:`~serverStatus.repl.hosts` is an array that lists the other nodes in the
   current replica set. Each member of the replica set appears in the
   form of ``hostname:port``.

.. example:: :ref:`output of the opcountersRepl fields <server-status-example-opcountersrepl>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.opcountersRepl

   The :data:`~serverStatus.opcountersRepl` data structure, similar to the
   :data:`~serverStatus.opcounters` data structure, provides an overview of
   database replication operations by type and makes it possible to
   analyze the load on the replica in more granular manner.  These
   values only appear when the current host has replication enabled.

   These values will differ from the :data:`~serverStatus.opcounters` values
   because of how MongoDB serializes operations during replication.
   See :doc:`/core/replication` for more information on replication.

   These numbers will grow over time in response to database
   use. Analyze these values over time to track database utilization.

.. _server-status-asserts:

asserts
-------

.. example:: :ref:`output of the asserts fields <server-status-example-asserts>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.asserts

   The :data:`~serverStatus.asserts` document reports the number of asserts on the
   database. While assert errors are typically uncommon, if there are
   non-zero values for the :data:`~serverStatus.asserts`, you should check the log
   file for the :program:`mongod` process for more information. In
   many cases these errors are trivial, but are worth investigating.

   that have occurred since the last time the server process
   started. These are errors that user may generate, such as out of
   disk space or duplicate key. You can prevent these assertions by
   fixing a problem with your application or deployment. Check the
   MongoDB log for more information.

.. data:: serverStatus.asserts.rollovers

   The :data:`~serverStatus.asserts.rollovers` counter displays the number of
   times that the rollover counters have rolled over since the last
   time the server process started. The counters will rollover to zero
   after 2\ :superscript:`30` assertions. Use this value to provide
   context to the other values in the :data:`~serverStatus.asserts` data structure.

Journaling
~~~~~~~~~~

.. example:: :ref:`output of the journaling fields <server-status-example-journaling>`.

.. data:: serverStatus.dur

   The :data:`~serverStatus.dur` (for "durability") document contains data
   regarding the :program:`mongod`'s journaling-related operations and
   performance. :program:`mongod` must be running with journaling for
   these data to appear in the output of ":dbcommand:`serverStatus`".

   .. note::

      The data values are **not** cumulative but are reset on a regular
      basis as determined by the :ref:`journal group commit interval
      <journaling-journal-commit-interval>`. This interval is ~100
      milliseconds (ms) by default (or 30ms if the journal file is on
      the same file system as your data files) and is cut by 1/3 when
      there is a :dbcommand:`getLastError` command pending. The
      interval is configurable using the ``--journalCommitInterval``
      option.

   .. seealso:: ":doc:`/administration/journaling`" for more information about journaling operations.

.. STUB :doc:`/core/journaling`

.. data:: serverStatus.dur.commits

.. data:: serverStatus.dur.commitsInWriteLock

   The :data:`~serverStatus.dur.commitsInWriteLock` provides a count of the commits
   that occurred while a write lock was held. Commits in a write lock
   indicate a MongoDB node under a heavy write load and call for
   further diagnosis.

.. data:: serverStatus.dur.earlyCommits

   The :data:`~serverStatus.dur.earlyCommits` value reflects the number of times
   MongoDB requested a commit before the scheduled :ref:`journal group
   commit interval <journaling-record-write-operation>`. Use this
   value to ensure that your :ref:`journal group commit interval
   <journaling-journal-commit-interval>` is not too long for your
   deployment.
