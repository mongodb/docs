Delete an Object
----------------

To delete an object from a realm, pass the object to :realm-react-sdk:`Realm.delete()
<classes/Realm-1.html#delete>` inside of a write transaction.

In the following example of a ``DogList`` component, we:

#. Get access to the opened realm instance by calling the ``useRealm()`` hook. 
#. Retrieve all dogs in the realm instance by passing ``Dog`` to the
   ``useQuery()`` hook.
#. Create a component method ``deleteDog()`` that takes in a ``Dog`` object as a
   parameter. Within the method, we pass ``Realm.delete()`` the ``Dog`` object,
   deleting it from the realm. 
#. `Map <https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists>`__ through the dogs to
   render a list of ``Text`` components that contain a dog's ``name`` and a
   "Delete Dog" button. 
#. Add an `onPress <https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches>`__ event on
   the "Delete Dog" button that calls the component's ``deleteDog()`` method.

.. important:: Do not use objects after delete
   
   You cannot access or modify an object after you have deleted it from a Realm.
   If you try to use a deleted object, Realm throws an error.

Delete Multiple Objects
-----------------------

You can delete multiple objects from a realm in a couple of ways:

#. To **delete all objects of a given object type** from a realm, pass the
   results of useQuery(<ObjectType>) to the :realm-react-sdk:`Realm.delete()
   <classes/Realm-1.html#delete>` method inside of a write transaction.
#. To **delete many specific objects** from a realm, pass
   :js-sdk:`Collection.filtered() <Realm.Collection.html#filtered>` to 
   ``Realm.delete()`` inside of a write transaction.

In the following example of a ``DogList`` component, we:

#. Retrieve the realm instance using the ``useRealm()`` hook. 
#. Set a variable ``myDogs`` to all the ``Dog`` objects by passing the ``Dog``
   class to the ``useQuery()`` hook.
#. Create a component method ``deleteAllYoungDogObjects()`` that performs a
   write transaction. Within the write transaction, we set a variable,
   ``youngDogs``, to the result of ``myDogs.filtered()`` with a query to
   obtain all dogs younger than three. Then pass ``youngDogs`` to
   ``realm.delete()``, deleting all young dogs from the realm.
#. Create a component method ``deleteAllDogObjects()`` that performs a write
   transaction. Within the write transaction, we pass ``myDogs`` to
   ``realm.delete()``, deleting all the dogs from the realm.
#. `Map <https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists>`__ through the dogs to render
   a list of ``Text`` components that contain a dog's ``name`` and ``age``.
#. Add an ``onPress`` event on the "Delete Young Dog Objects" button that calls
   ``deleteAllYoungDogObjects()``, deleting all young dogs from the realm,
   which triggers a re-render and removes them from the UI. 
#. Add an ``onPress`` event on the "Delete All Dog Objects" button that calls
   ``deleteAllDogObjects()``, deleting every dog from the realm, which triggers
   a re-render and removes them from the UI. 

.. note:: 

   When you delete objects from the realm instance, the component automatically re-renders and removes them from the UI.

Delete All Objects in a Realm
-----------------------------

To delete **all** objects from the realm, call :realm-react-sdk:`Realm.deleteAll()
<classes/Realm-1.html#deleteAll>` inside of a write transaction. This clears the realm
of all object instances but does not affect the realm's schema.

In the following example of a ``DeleteProfileSettingsScreen`` component, we:

#. Get access to the opened realm instance by calling the ``useRealm()`` hook within the component. 
#. Create a component method ``deleteAllData()`` that performs a write transaction and calls ``Realm.deleteAll()``, deleting all objects from the realm. 
#. Add an ``onPress`` event on the "Delete all data" button that calls ``deleteAllData()``.

.. tip:: Delete All In Development
   
   :realm-react-sdk:`Realm.deleteAll() <classes/Realm-1.html#deleteAll>` is a
   useful method to quickly clear out your realm in the course of development.
   For example, rather than writing a migration to update objects to a new
   schema, it may be faster to delete and then re-generate the objects with the
   app itself.
