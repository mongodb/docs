Backups depend upon which :manual:`version of MongoDB your database is
compatible </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`. For
MongoDB 4.4, the FCV can be ``4.2`` or ``4.4``.

Backup Definition and Operational States
----------------------------------------

Each backup is defined as a :term:`job <backup job>`. Each job defines
how much and how often data is backed up. Backup jobs are defined on a
per-project basis.

Operational States
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table lists the states of a backup job:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 20 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - State
     - Retain Old Snapshots
     - Create New Snapshots

   * - ``Active``
     - Yes
     - Yes

   * - ``Stopped``
     - Yes
     - No

   * - ``Inactive``
     - No
     - No

   * - ``Misconfigured``
     - Yes
     - No

.. note::

   The ``Misconfigured`` state applies only to :ref:`regional-backup`.

Change Operational States
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once backup jobs are active for a :opsmgr:`project </reference/glossary/#std-term-project>`, they run without
further intervention until they are stopped or terminated. The operator
can change the state of a backup in the following ways:

Backup Process Flows
--------------------

Once created, a backup job goes through the following process flow:

.. include:: /includes/backup/wtchk-process-initial-backup.rst

.. _regional-backup:

Regional Backup
---------------

You can assign backup jobs to :ref:`deployment-regions-interface` to
promote data isolation. When you assign a backup job to a deployment
region, |onprem| writes all snapshots, oplogs, and sync data that the
job generates to the relevant storage configured for that
region. Regional backup is available for replica sets and sharded
clusters. To enable regional backup for a sharded cluster, you must
assign deployment regions and initiate backup jobs for each shard
separately.

To determine whether regional backup is enabled in your deployment, you
can check for the following in the :guilabel:`Continuous Backup`
dashboard. 

- :guilabel:`Backup Region` on the top right corner displays the group's
  deployment region by default and if the project is enabled for
  regional backup, it displays the legend :guilabel:`Multi-Region`. 
- :guilabel:`Regional Backup` column displays in the dashboard.
