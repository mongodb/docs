Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to monitor a  **change stream**,
allowing you to view real-time changes to your database. A change stream is a {+mdb-server+} feature that
publishes data changes on a collection, database, or deployment. Your application can
subscribe to a change stream and use events to perform other actions.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

The following {+language+} data class models the documents in this collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.kt
   :start-after: start-data-class
   :end-before: end-data-class
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:

Open a Change Stream
--------------------

To open a change stream, call the ``watch()`` method. The instance on which you
call the ``watch()`` method on determines the scope of events that the change
stream listens for. You can call the ``watch()`` method on instances of the following
classes:

- ``MongoClient``: To monitor all changes in the MongoDB deployment
- ``MongoDatabase``: To monitor changes in all collections in the database
- ``MongoCollection``: To monitor changes in the collection

Open a Change Stream Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example opens a change stream on the ``restaurants`` collection
and prints changes as they occur:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.kt
   :start-after: start-open-change-stream
   :end-before: end-open-change-stream
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To begin watching for changes, run the application. Then, in a separate
application or shell, perform a write operation on the ``restaurants`` collection. The
following example updates a document in which the value of the ``name`` is ``"Blarney Castle"``:

.. _kotlin-sync-change-stream-update:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.kt
   :start-after: start-update-for-change-stream
   :end-before: end-update-for-change-stream
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

When you update the collection, the change stream application prints the change
as it occurs. The printed change event resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "_id": { ... },
     "operationType": "update",
     "clusterTime": { ... },
     "ns": {
       "db": "sample_restaurants",
       "coll": "restaurants"
     },
     "updateDescription": {
       "updatedFields": {
         "cuisine": "Irish"
       },
       "removedFields": [],
       "truncatedArrays": []
     }
     ...
   }

Modify the Change Stream Output
-------------------------------

You can pass the ``pipeline`` parameter to the ``watch()`` method to modify the
change stream output. This parameter allows you to watch for only specified
change events. Format the parameter as a list of objects that each represents an
aggregation stage.

You can specify the following stages in the ``pipeline`` parameter:

- ``$addFields``
- ``$match``
- ``$project``
- ``$replaceRoot``
- ``$replaceWith``
- ``$redact``
- ``$set``
- ``$unset``

Match Specific events Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example uses the ``pipeline`` parameter that includes a ``$match``
to open a change stream that only records update operations:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.kt
   :start-after: start-change-stream-pipeline
   :end-before: end-change-stream-pipeline
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

To learn more about modifying your change stream output, see the
:manual:`Modify Change Stream Output
</changeStreams/#modify-change-stream-output>` section in the {+mdb-server+}
manual.

Modify watch() Behavior
-----------------------

You can modify the ``watch()`` by chaining methods to the ``ChangeStreamIterable``
object returned by the ``watch()`` method call. If you don't specify any options, the
driver does not customize the operation.

The following table describes methods you can use to customize the behavior
of ``watch()``:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``batchSize()``
     - | Sets the number of documents to return per batch.

   * - ``collation()``
     - | Specifies the kind of language collation to use when sorting
         results. For more information, see :manual:`Collation </reference/collation/#std-label-collation>`
         in the {+mdb-server+} manual.

   * - ``comment()``
     - | Specifies a comment to attach to the operation.

   * - ``fullDocument()``
     - | Sets the ``fullDocument`` value. To learn more, see the
         :ref:`<kotlin-sync-change-stream-pre-post-image>` section of this document.

   * - ``fullDocumentBeforeChange()``
     - | Sets the ``fullDocumentBeforeChange`` value. To learn more, see the
         :ref:`<kotlin-sync-change-stream-pre-post-image>` section of this document.

   * - ``maxAwaitTime()``
     - | Sets the maximum await execution time on the server for this operation, in
         milliseconds.

For a complete list of methods you can use to configure the ``watch()`` method, see
the `ChangeStreamIterable <{+driver-api+}/-change-stream-iterable/index.html>`__
API documentation.

.. _kotlin-sync-change-stream-pre-post-image:

Include Pre-Images and Post-Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   You can enable pre-images and post-images on collections only if your
   deployment uses MongoDB v6.0 or later.

By default, when you perform an operation on a collection, the
corresponding change event includes only the delta of the fields
modified by that operation. To see the full document before or after a
change, chain the ``fullDocumentBeforeChange()`` or the ``fullDocument()``
methods to the ``watch()`` method.

The **pre-image** is the full version of a document *before* a change. To include the
pre-image in the change stream event, pass one of the following options to the
``fullDocumentBeforeChange()`` method:

- ``FullDocumentBeforeChange.WHEN_AVAILABLE``: The change event includes a pre-image of the
  modified document for change events only if the pre-image is available.
- ``FullDocumentBeforeChange.REQUIRED``: The change event includes a pre-image of the
  modified document for change events. If the pre-image is not available, the
  driver raises an error.

The **post-image** is the full version of a document *after* a change. To include the
post-image in the change stream event, pass one of the following options to the 
``fullDocument()`` method:

- ``FullDocument.UPDATE_LOOKUP``: The change event includes a copy of the entire changed
  document from some time after the change.
- ``FullDocument.WHEN_AVAILABLE``: The change event includes a post-image of the
  modified document for change events only if the post-image is available.
- ``FullDocument.REQUIRED``: The change event includes a post-image of the
  modified document for change events. If the post-image is not available, the
  driver raises an error.

The following example calls the ``watch()`` method on a collection and includes the post-image
of updated documents in the results by specifying the ``fullDocument`` parameter:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/change-streams.kt
   :start-after: start-change-stream-post-image
   :end-before: end-change-stream-post-image
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

With the change stream application running, updating a document in the
``restaurants`` collection by using the :ref:`preceding update example
<kotlin-sync-change-stream-update>` prints a change event resembling the following:

.. code-block:: none
   
   ChangeStreamDocument{ operationType=update, resumeToken={"_data": "..."},
   namespace=sample_restaurants.restaurants, destinationNamespace=null, fullDocument=Restaurant(name=Blarney Castle, cuisine=Irish),
   fullDocumentBeforeChange=null, documentKey={"_id": {"$oid": "..."}},
   clusterTime=Timestamp{value=..., seconds=..., inc=...},
   updateDescription=UpdateDescription{removedFields=[], updatedFields={"cuisine": "Irish"},
   truncatedArrays=[], disambiguatedPaths=null}, txnNumber=null, lsid=null, splitEvent=null,
   wallTime=BsonDateTime{value=...}}


To learn more about pre-images and post-images, see 
:manual:`Change Streams with Document Pre- and Post-Images </changeStreams#change-streams-with-document-pre--and-post-images>`
