Initialize the MongoDB C Driver by calling `mongoc_init <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_init.html>`__ exactly once at the beginning of your program.
It is responsible for initializing global state such as process counters, SSL, and threading primitives.

Exception to this is ``mongoc_log_set_handler()``, which should be called before ``mongoc_init()`` or some
log traces would not use your log handling function. See `Custom Log Handlers <{+api-libmongoc+}/logging.html#custom-log-handlers>`__
for a detailed example.

Call `mongoc_cleanup <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_cleanup.html>`__ exactly once at the end of your program to release all memory and other resources
allocated by the driver. You must not call any other MongoDB C Driver functions after `mongoc_cleanup <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_cleanup.html>`__.
Note that `mongoc_init <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_init.html>`__ does **not** reinitialize the driver after `mongoc_cleanup <{+api-libmongoc+}/mongoc_cleanup.html>`__.
