Starting in MongoDB version 7.0, you can use the :pipeline:`$out`
aggregation stage to migrate data from an existing collection into a
:ref:`time series collection <manual-timeseries-collection>`.

.. note::

   MongoDB does not guarantee output order when you use :pipeline:`$out` to
   migrate data into a times series collection. To maintain order, sort
   your data before you migrate with an aggregation pipeline. 


Before you Begin
----------------

Consider a ``weatherdata`` collection that contains time and metadata information:

.. include:: /includes/time-series/migrate-timeseries-sample-collection.rst

Steps
-----

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create a metadata field.
   
      If your collection doesn't include a field you can use to identify each
      series, transform your data to define one. In this example, the
      ``metaData`` field becomes the ``metaField`` of the time series collection
      that you create.  

      .. include:: /includes/time-series/timeseries-metafield-note.rst

      The pipline below performs the following operations:

      - Uses :pipeline:`$addFields` to add a ``metaData`` field to the
        ``weather_data`` collection.
      - Uses :pipeline:`$project` to include or exclude the remaining fields in the
        document. 

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.weather_data.aggregate([
         {
            $addFields: {
               metaData: {
                  "st": "$st",
                  "position": "$position",
                  "elevation": "$elevation",
                  "callLetters": "$callLetters",
                  "qualityControlProcess": "$qualityControlProcess",
                  "type": "$type"
               }
            },
         }, 
         {
            $project: {
               _id: 1,
               ts: 1,
               metaData: 1,
               dataSource: 1,
               airTemperature: 1,
               dewPoint: 1,
               pressure: 1,
               wind: 1,
               visibility: 1,
               skyCondition: 1,
               sections: 1,
               precipitationEstimatedObservation: 1
            }
         }
         ])

   .. step:: Create your time series collection and insert your data.

      Add an :pipeline:`$out` aggregation stage to your pipeline to create a
      time series collection and insert your data into it. The pipeline below
      performs the following operations:

      - Uses :pipeline:`$out` with the
        ``timeseries`` option to create a ``weathernew`` time series collection
        in the ``mydatabase`` database. 
      - Defines the ``metaData`` field as the ``metaField`` of 
        the ``weathernew`` collection.
      - Defines the ``ts`` field as the ``timeField`` of the
        ``weathernew`` collection.

        .. note::

           The ``timeField`` of a time series collection must be a :ref:`date
           <document-bson-type-date>` type. 
      
      .. code-block:: javascript

         {
            $out: {
               db: "mydatabase",
               coll: "weathernew",
               timeseries: {
                  timeField: "ts",
                  metaField: "metaData",
                  granularity: "seconds"
               }
            }
         }

      For the aggregation stage syntax, see
      :pipeline:`$out`. For a full explanation of the time series
      options, see the :ref:`Time Series Field Reference
      <time-series-fields>`.


   .. step:: Review your data.

      After you run this aggregation pipeline, you can use
      :method:`~db.collection.findOne()` to view a document in your
      ``weathernew`` time series collection:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.weathernew.findOne()


      The operation returns the following document: 

      .. code-block:: javascript
         :copyable: false

            {
               _id: ObjectId("5553a998e4b02cf7151190b8"),
               ts: ISODate("1984-03-05T13:00:00Z"),
               metaData: {
                  st: "x+47600-047900",
                  position: {
                     type: "Point",
                     coordinates: [ -47.9, 47.6 ]
                  },
                  elevation: 9999,
                  callLetters: "VCSZ",
                  qualityControlProcess: "V020",
                  type: "FM-13"
               },
               dataSource: "4",
               airTemperature: { value: -3.1, quality: "1" },
               dewPoint: { value: 999.9, quality: "9" },
               pressure: { value: 1015.3, quality: "1" },
               wind: {
                  direction: { angle: 999, quality: "9" },
                  type: "9",
                  speed: { rate: 999.9, quality: "9" }
               },
               visibility: {
                  distance: { value: 999999, quality: "9" },
                  variability: { value: "N", quality: "9" }
               },
               skyCondition: {
                  ceilingHeight: { value: 99999, quality: "9", determination: "9" },
                  cavok: "N"
               },
               sections: [ "AG1" ],
               precipitationEstimatedObservation: { discrepancy: "2", estimatedWaterDepth: 999 }
            }

Next Steps
----------

If your original collection had secondary indexes, manually recreate 
them now. 

If your time series collection includes ``timeField`` values before
``1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`` or after ``2038-01-19T03:14:07.000Z``,
MongoDB logs a warning and disables some query optimizations that make
use of the :ref:`internal clustered index
<manual-timeseries-internal-index>`. To regain query performance and
resolve the log warning, :ref:`create a secondary index
<timeseries-add-secondary-index>` on the ``timeField``.
