.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: replSetReconfig

   The :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` command modifies the configuration
   of an existing replica set. You can use this command to add and
   remove members, and to alter the options set on existing
   members. Use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetReconfig: <new_config_document>, force: false }

   You may also run :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` with the shell's
   :method:`rs.reconfig()` method.

.. slave-ok, admin-only

Behaviors
---------

Be aware of the following :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` behaviors:

- You must issue this command against the :term:`admin database` of the current
  primary member of the replica set.

- You can optionally force the replica set to accept the new
  configuration by specifying ``force: true``. Use this option if
  the current member is not primary or if a majority of the members
  of the set are not accessible.

  .. warning::

     Forcing the :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` command can lead to a
     :term:`rollback` situation. Use with caution.

  Use the force option to restore a replica set to new servers with
  different hostnames. This works even if the set members already
  have a copy of the data.

- A majority of the set's members must be operational for the
  changes to propagate properly.

- This command can cause downtime as the set renegotiates
  primary-status. Typically this is 10-20 seconds, but could
  be as long as a minute or more. Therefore, you should attempt
  to reconfigure only during scheduled maintenance periods.

- In some cases, :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` forces the current
  primary to step down, initiating an election for primary among
  the members of the replica set. When this happens, the set will
  drop all current connections.

:dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` obtains a special mutually
exclusive lock to prevent more than one
:dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` operation from occurring at the same
time.
