The |onprem| Application manages backups for |fcv| 4.2 and later. To
ensure high availability of backups, deploy sufficient number of
|onprem| hosts with a load balancer. To learn how to deploy 
|onprem| with high availability, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-application-high-availability`.

.. important::

   Backups depend upon which :manual:`version of MongoDB your database
   is compatible </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`. 
   This Feature Compatibility Version ranges from the current version to
   one version earlier. For example, with MongoDB 5.0, the FCV can be
   4.4 or 5.0. Backup changed with the MongoDB 4.2. Backup configuration
   and execution changed between FCV 4.0 and FCV 4.2.

Even though we recommend that you :ref:`deploy Ops Manager with high
availability </tutorial/configure-application-high-availability>`, for
|fcv| 4.2 and later, you must run at least one :ref:`Backup
Daemon on a server <backup-daemon>`. 

The following procedure demontrates how to start and stop the
:ref:`Backup Daemon <backup-daemon>` on a server.

Procedure
---------

1. Start the Backup Daemon:

   .. code-block:: sh

      /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms-backup-daemon start

#. Stop the Backup Daemon:

   .. code-block:: sh

      /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms-backup-daemon stop

#. Restart the Backup Daemon:

   .. code-block:: sh

      /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms-backup-daemon restart

#. Check the status of the Backup Daemon:

   .. code-block:: sh

      /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms-backup-daemon status
