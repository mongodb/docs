:guilabel:`Data Migration` tab.

About this Task
---------------

The effects of stopping a migration job on your destination database depend on 
the type and stage of the migration job:

- If you stop a snapshot migration job during the snapshot stage, any 
  partially migrated data remains in the MongoDB database.
- If you stop a continuous migration job during the CDC stage, the process 
  ends gracefully, and Relational Migrator cleans up any temporary data.
- After a migration job is stopped, you cannot resume it. To migrate data from
  a stopped migration job, you can create a new job and select the option 
  :guilabel:`Drop destination collections before migration`.

Once initiated, the process of canceling or completing a migration job may 
take up to one minute.

Steps

      tabs:

         - id: stop-snapshot
           name: Stop a Migration Job in Snapshot stage
           content: |

                      Once a migration job cancels, an :guilabel:`x` icon displays 
                      in the :guilabel:`History` pane, and the status of the
                      migration job updates to :guilabel:`Snapshot cancelled`.

         - id: stop-cdc
           name: Stop a Migration Job in CDC stage
           content: |
              .. procedure::
                :style: connected

                .. step:: Open the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab

                .. step:: Click on the migration job in the :guilabel:`History` pane

                .. step:: Complete the migration job

                   #. Click the green :guilabel:`Complete CDC` button on the pop-up modal.
                      Upon completion, the migration job displays a 
                      :icon-lg:`Checkmark` in the :guilabel:`History` 
                      pane and marks all stages as 
                      :guilabel:`Completed`. The status is 
                      updated to :guilabel:`CDC Completed`.
