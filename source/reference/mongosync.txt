Definition
----------

The ``mongosync`` binary is the primary process used in {+c2c-product-name+}. 
``mongosync`` migrates data from one cluster to another and can keep the 
clusters in continuous sync.

You can use ``mongosync`` to create dedicated analytics, development,
or testing clusters that mirror your production environment.
Synchronized clusters can also support locality requirements for audit
and data residency compliance. 

In addition to continuous data synchronization, ``mongosync`` can also
facilitate a one time data migration between clusters. 

For an overview of the ``mongosync`` process, see :ref:`about-mongosync`.

To get started with ``mongosync``, refer to the :ref:`Quick Start Guide
<c2c-quickstart>`.

Compatibility
-------------

- .. include:: /includes/fact-partial-8.0-support.rst

- .. include:: /includes/fact-minimum-server-version-support.rst
     
  You can migrate data on clusters (source) with versions of MongoDB
  lower than 6.0 to an Atlas cluster (destination). Migration from clusters with
  lower version requires additional preparation and configuration in
  the clusters with the lower version. `Contact
  <https://mongodb.com/contact>`__ your account team to inquire about 
  Professional Services.  

- ``mongosync`` supports replica sets and sharded clusters.
- Standalone MongoDB instances are not supported. :ref:`Convert the
  standalone instance <server-replica-set-deploy-convert>` to a
  replica set before using {+c2c-product-name+}. 
- ``mongosync`` does not support Atlas shared clusters or serverless 
  instances. 
- For a full list of limitations, see :ref:`Cluster-to-Cluster Sync
  Limitations<c2c-limitations>`.
