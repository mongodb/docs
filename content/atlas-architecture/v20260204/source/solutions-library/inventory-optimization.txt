Solution Overview  
-----------------  

Global automotive operations face compounding disruptions. Volatile
geopolitics and the return of tariffs have delayed model-year
transitions and created severe inventory shortages. As of June 2025,
next-model-year vehicles consist of only 3% of US inventory. To navigate
this constrained supply and protect margins, you need tools that go
beyond simple financial metrics.

Traditionally, organizations rely on ABC analysis to segment inventory.
This method prioritizes items solely based on dollar usage, where
"Category A" drives the most revenue and "Category C" the least. While
simple, this approach ignores critical variables such as lead time,
durability, or obsolescence.

   :alt: ABC analysis for inventory classification.

   Figure 1. ABC analysis for inventory classification.

Multi-Criteria Inventory Classification (MCIC) improves this by adding
quantitative data points, but it still suffers from a blind spot:
unstructured data. Customer reviews, maintenance logs, and social
sentiment account for 80% of global data, yet traditional models cannot
process them. This solution bridges that gap. By combining Generative AI
and MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, you transform qualitative feedback into
actionable scoring features.

This solution enables you to move from reactive inventory tracking to
predictive, customer-centric decision-making. MongoDB empowers the next
generation of AI-driven inventory classification through a four-step
methodology:

1. Create and store vector embeddings from your unstructured data.

2. Design and store evaluation criteria relevant to your business goals.

3. Create an agentic application to perform data transformation based on those criteria.

4. Rerun the inventory classification model with the new features added.

   Figure 3. Methodology and requirements for Gen AI-powered inventory classification.

Beyond automating the manual evaluation of qualitative criteria, this
solution operationalizes your entire data strategy. By unifying vector
embeddings, metadata, and operational data in a single platform, you
eliminate the latency of disjointed batch analytics pipelines. You can
process new SKUs the moment they arrive, enabling you to manage massive
product catalogs with real-time precision and scale.

Reference Architectures
-----------------------

This architecture operationalizes the four-step methodology. This
solution relies on a dynamic, agentic workflow where MongoDB Atlas
serves as the data backbone.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create and store vector embeddings

      Ingest unstructured data, such as product reviews,
      supplier notes, or support transcripts, into MongoDB Atlas. You
      use an embedding model (such as those from `Voyage AI
      <https://www.voyageai.com/>`__) to vectorize this text. You then
      store the resulting embeddings directly alongside the original
      source text in your MongoDB documents. This unified approach
      reduces infrastructure complexity and enables you to run
      low-latency semantic searches through a single API.

      .. figure:: /includes/images/industry-solutions/inventory-op4.svg
         :figwidth: 1200px
         :alt: Product reviews can be stored as vector embeddings in MongoDB Atlas.

         Figure 4. Product reviews can be stored as vector embeddings in MongoDB Atlas.

   .. step:: Design and store evaluation criteria

      Define classification rules based on your specific
      business objectives, including cost reduction, minimizing
      stockouts, or enhancing customer experience. Previously, this
      demanded extensive manual effort and deep expert knowledge to map
      these goals to data. Now, an AI agent automates and scales this
      process.

      The agent analyzes your available data and context to propose the
      optimal parameters and data source combinations to meet your
      objectives. You store these dynamic definitions in MongoDB as
      flexible JSON documents. This enables you to apply consistent,
      informed decision-making across massive inventories and adapt
      instantly to changing business requirements.

        :figwidth: 1200px
        :alt: Unstructured and structured data are used by the AI agent to create criteria for feature generation.

        Figure 5. Unstructured and structured data are used by the AI agent to create criteria for feature generation.

   .. step:: Transform data with an agentic application

      In this step, a second AI agent calculates the actual scores for
      your inventory. The agent iterates through your product catalog
      and uses MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to retrieve specific customer
      reviews relevant to the criteria defined in Step 2.

      The agent analyzes this retrieval set, calculates a numerical
      feature score, and updates the original product document with this
      new data. This capability enriches your dataset with qualitative
      insights that are now mathematically comparable to your
      quantitative metrics.

        :alt: An AI agent enriches product features with vectorized review data to generate new features.

        Figure 6. An AI agent enriches product features with vectorized review data to generate new features.

   .. step:: Rerun the inventory classification model

      Incorporate these new features into your MCIC model.
      Domain experts can assign weights to these new AI-generated
      signals to balance them against traditional financial metrics.
      Rerun the classification algorithm to segment your inventory into
      informed categories that reflect both economic value and
      real-world customer sentiment.

        :figwidth: 1200px
        :alt: Domain experts can rerun classification after balancing weights.

Data Model Approach
-------------------

The MongoDB document model unifies diverse data types without rigid
schema constraints. This capability simplifies how you represent complex
data at scale. The following examples illustrate the data structures
required for this agentic workflow.

- **Quantitative metrics**

  Typically, inventory transactions, such as ``orders``, contain the raw
  data required to calculate standard MCIC metrics, such as Annual
  Dollar Usage, Average Unit Cost, Total Annual Usage, and Lead Time.

  In relational systems, order data is often fragmented across multiple
  tables for headers, line items, and logistics. To optimize for read
  performance and simplify your application logic, you can store this
  data into a single orders collection.

  Using the `Extended Reference Pattern
  <https://www.mongodb.com/company/blog/building-with-patterns-the-extended-reference-pattern>`__,
  you embed product information within the items list of the order. This
  approach enables you to retrieve the full context of a transaction in
  a single database operation.

  .. code-block:: JSON

     {
       "_id": "order_55021",
       "status": "delivered",
       "purchaseTimestamp": { "$date": "2024-05-08T16:05:31.000Z" },
       "items": [
         {
           "price": 85.00,
           "productId": "part_9921_brake_pad",
           "productName": "Ceramic Brake Pads - Front Pair"
         }
       ],
       "reviews": [
         {
           "reviewId": "rev_7721",
           "score": 5,
           "commentTitle": "Great fit",
           "commentMessage": "Arrived on time and fit perfectly on my 2020 Sedan."
         }
       ]
     }

- **Metrics derived from unstructured sources**

  Valuable inventory signals often exist in unstructured text such as
  maintenance logs, support tickets, or customer feedback. In this
  example, you can use reviews to perform semantic analysis by
  generating vector embeddings for the title and message content.

  Store vector embeddings (emb) alongside the original text fields to
  enable hybrid searches using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search.
  Additionally, metadata such as the review score enables you to combine
  semantic queries (for example, finding reviews about "reliability")
  with structured filters (for example, ``"score": 5``).

  .. code-block:: JSON

     {
       "_id": "rev_99812",
       "productId": "part_9921_brake_pad",
       "score": 5,
       "title": "Excellent durability",
       "message": "I've put 20k miles on these pads and they still look new. Much better than OEM.",
       "emb": [0.02, -0.15, 0.44, 0.12, ... ]
     }

- **Criteria Definition**

  A crucial step in this solution is defining flexible, data-driven
  classification criteria. Instead of relying on hard-coded rules, save
  criteria as "knowledge objects" in a criteria collection. An AI agent
  generates these definitions based on your business objectives (for
  example, "Durability") and the available data.

  This document structure includes weights, explicit scoring scales, and
  data sources. This document structure provides a schema that the agent
  can use to consistently evaluate products across your inventory.

  .. code-block:: JSON

     {
       "criteriaName": "Durability",
       "criteriaDefinition": "Measures how customers perceive the product’s durability relative to their expectations.",
       "elements": [
         {
           "name": "Expected Durability",
           "weight": 0.30,
           "description": "The level of durability customers believe the product should have based on price and category."
         },
         {
           "name": "Perceived Durability",
           "weight": 0.40,
           "description": "How customers describe the actual durability, build quality, and sturdiness after usage."
         }
       ],
       "scoringScale": [
         {
           "description": "Highly durable item that meets or exceeds expectations, strongly positive sentiment",
           "score": 1
         },
         {
           "description": "Low durability item that fails to meet expectations, negative sentiment",
           "score": 0.01
         }
       ],
       "dataSources": ["inventory", "reviews"]
     }

Key Learnings
-------------

This solution demonstrates how to modernize inventory classification by
combining generative AI with the flexibility of the document model. As
you implement this architecture, consider these core benefits:

- **Unlock hidden inventory value:** Traditional financial metrics miss
  critical insights contained in text. By vectorizing unstructured data
  such as customer reviews and maintenance logs, you transform qualitative
  feedback into quantitative features that improve classification
  accuracy.

- **Automate criteria generation:** Manual rule-setting is slow and
  rigid. An agentic workflow enables you to dynamically generate and score
  evaluation criteria based on high-level business objectives. This scales
  expert decision-making across massive product catalogs.

- **Simplify data architecture:** Disjointed systems create latency. By
  storing operational data, metadata, and vector embeddings in a single
  MongoDB document model, you eliminate complex Extract, Transform, and
  Load (ETL) pipelines and enable real-time analysis of new inventory
  items.

- **Enhance decision quality:** Financial metrics alone lead to gaps in
  insight. Integrating customer sentiment and product reliability scores
  creates a holistic view of inventory value, enabling you to prioritize
  high-impact items that traditional ABC analysis ignores.
