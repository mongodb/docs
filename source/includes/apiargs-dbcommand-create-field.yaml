  Available for the MMAPv1 storage engine only to set the
  :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` and the :collflag:`noPadding` flags. To
  set, specify one of the following values:

  .. include:: /includes/list-collection-user-flags.rst

  Defaults to ``1``.

  .. versionadded:: 2.6

  .. versionchanged:: 3.0.0
     Add support for setting the new :collflag:`noPadding` flag.

  .. warning::
     Do not set ``noPadding`` if the workload includes removes or any
     updates that may cause documents to grow. For more information,
     see :ref:`exact-fit-allocation`.

name: collation
description: |
   Specifies the default :ref:`collation <collation>` for the
   collection or the view.
   
   .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-description.rst

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-option-specification.rst

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-collection-level.rst

   .. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-unspecified.rst

   For a view, if no collation is specified, the view's default
   collation is the "simple" binary comparison collator. For a view on
   a collection, the view does not inherit the collection's collation
   settings. For a view on another view, the to be created view must
   specify the same collation settings.

   After you create the collection or the view, you cannot update its
   default collation.

   For an example that specifies the default collation during the
   creation of a collection, see {{example}}.
