title: "Set up a phone number for two-factor authentication."
stepnum: 1
ref: backup-register-setup-auth
content: |
   All restores, backups, and confirmation of deletions use two-factor
   authentication. |mms| does not use two factor authentication by default for login.
   Enter your SMS-capable mobile phone number and click the :guilabel:`Send
   Code` button, or configure the Google Authenticator
   application. You will receive an authentication code via text on
   this number.

   Once you receive the authentication code, enter the code in the
   :guilabel:`Authentication Code` box and click the :guilabel:`Authenticate`
   button. When the code authenticates, click the :guilabel:`Next` button.
