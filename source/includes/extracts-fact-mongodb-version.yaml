   As new maintenance releases become available, |service| upgrades to
   these releases via a rolling process to maintain cluster
   availability.

   MongoDB versions, see :ref:`atlas-eol-upgrade`.

   You can upgrade an existing |service| cluster to a newer major
   MongoDB version, if available, when you
   :ref:`scale a cluster <scale-cluster-version>`. However, you
   cannot downgrade a cluster's MongoDB version.

   .. important::

      If your project contains a :ref:`custom role <mongodb-roles>`
      that uses actions introduced in a specific MongoDB version, you
      cannot create a cluster with a MongoDB version less than that
      version unless you delete the custom role.

ref: fact-mongodb-version-downgrade-restriction-scale
content: |

   |service| always upgrades the cluster to the latest stable release
   of the specified version via a rolling process to maintain cluster
   availability.

   You cannot downgrade the cluster to an earlier MongoDB version.
