Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to perform
**transactions**. Transactions allow you to run a series of operations that do 
not change any data until the transaction is committed. If any operation in 
the transaction returns an error, the driver cancels the transaction and discards 
all data changes before they ever become visible.

In MongoDB, transactions run within logical **sessions**. A
session is a grouping of related read or write operations that you intend to run 
sequentially. Sessions enable **causal consistency** for a
group of operations and allow you to run operations in an
**ACID-compliant transaction**, which is a transaction that meets an expectation
of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. MongoDB guarantees that the 
data involved in your transaction operations remains consistent, even if the 
operations encounter unexpected errors.

When using the {+driver-short+}, you can create a new session from a
``MongoClient`` instance as a ``ClientSession`` type. We recommend that you reuse
your ``MongoClient`` for multiple sessions and transactions instead of
creating a new client each time.

.. warning::

   Use a ``ClientSession`` only with the ``MongoClient`` (or associated
   ``MongoDatabase`` or ``MongoCollection``) that created it. Using a
   ``ClientSession`` with a different ``MongoClient`` results in operation
   errors.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

The documents in this collection are modeled by the following {+language+} data class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/transaction.kt
   :start-after: start-data-class
   :end-before: end-data-class
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

Methods
-------

Create a ``ClientSession`` by using the ``startSession()`` method on your ``MongoClient``
instance. You can then modify the session state by using the methods provided by
the ``ClientSession``. The following table describes the methods you can use to
manage your transaction:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``startTransaction()``
     - | Starts a new transaction, configured with the given options, on
         this session. Returns an error if there is already
         a transaction in progress for the session. To learn more about
         this method, see the :manual:`startTransaction() page
         </reference/method/Session.startTransaction/>`  in the Server manual.
       |
       | **Parameter**: ``TransactionOptions``

   * - ``abortTransaction()``
     - | Ends the active transaction for this session. Returns an
         error if there is no active transaction for the session or the
         transaction has been committed or ended. To learn more about
         this method, see the :manual:`abortTransaction() page
         </reference/method/Session.abortTransaction/>`  in the Server manual.
       |

   * - ``commitTransaction()``
     - | Commits the active transaction for this session. Returns an
         error if there is no active transaction for the session or if the
         transaction was ended. To learn more about
         this method, see the :manual:`commitTransaction() page
         </reference/method/Session.commitTransaction/>`  in the Server manual.

   * - ``withTransaction()``
     - | Starts a transaction on this session and runs the given function within 
         a transaction.
       |
       | **Parameters**: transaction body function, ``TransactionOptions``

.. tip:: Transaction Timeout

   You can set a limit on amount of time that operations can take
   to complete in your transactions. To learn more, see the
   :ref:`kotlin-sync-csot-transaction` section of the Limit Server
   Execution Time guide.

Example
-------

The following example demonstrates how to create a session, create a
transaction, and insert documents into a collection in one transaction
through the following steps:

1. Create a session from the client by using the ``startSession()`` method.
#. Define the ``insertRestaurantsInTransaction()`` method to insert multiple 
   documents into the ``restaurants`` collection. 
#. Use the ``withTransaction()`` method to start a transaction. The ``withTransaction()`` 
   method runs the insert operations and commits the transaction. If any 
   operation results in errors, ``withTransaction()`` cancels the transaction.
#. Close the connection to the server by using the ``MongoClient.close()`` method.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/write/transaction.kt
   :start-after: start-transaction
   :end-before: end-transaction
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

If you require more control over your transactions, you can use the ``startTransaction()``
method. You can use this method with the ``commitTransaction()`` and ``abortTransaction()``
methods described in the preceding section to manually manage the transaction lifecycle.
