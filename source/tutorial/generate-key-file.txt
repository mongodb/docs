This section describes how to generate a key file to store
authentication information. After generating a key file, specify the key
file using the :setting:`keyFile` option when starting a
:binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance.

A key's length must be between 6 and 1024 characters and may only contain
characters in the base64 set. The key file must not have group or world
permissions on UNIX systems. Key file permissions are not checked on
Windows systems.

Generate a Key File
-------------------

Use the following ``openssl`` command at the system shell to generate
pseudo-random content for a key file:

.. code-block:: sh

   openssl rand -base64 741

.. note::

   Key file permissions are not checked on Windows systems.

Key File Properties
-------------------

Be aware that MongoDB strips whitespace characters (e.g. ``x0d``,
``x09``, and ``x20``) for cross-platform convenience. As a result,
the following operations produce identical keys:

.. code-block:: sh

   echo -e "my secret key" > key1
   echo -e "my secret key\n" > key2
   echo -e "my    secret    key" > key3
   echo -e "my\r\nsecret\r\nkey\r\n" > key4
