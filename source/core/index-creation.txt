.. versionchanged:: MongoDB 4.2

MongoDB index builds against a populated collection require an exclusive
read-write lock against the collection. Operations that require a read
or write lock on the collection must wait until the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` releases the lock. MongoDB 4.2 uses an optimized
build process that only holds the  exclusive lock at the beginning and
end of the index build. The rest of the build process yields to
interleaving read and write operations.

The build process is summarized as follows:

1. **Initialization**

   The :binary:`~bin.mongod` takes an exclusive lock against the
   collection being indexed. This blocks all read and write operations
   to the collection until the :binary:`~bin.mongod` releases the lock.
   Applications cannot access the collection during
   this time.

2. **Data Ingestion and Processing**

   The :binary:`~bin.mongod` releases all locks taken by the index build
   process before taking a series of intent locks against the collection
   being indexed.  Applications can issue read and write operations
   against the collection during this time.

3. **Cleanup**

   The :binary:`~bin.mongod` releases all locks taken by the index build
   process before taking an exclusive lock against the the collection
   being indexed. This blocks all read and write operations to the
   collection until the :binary:`~bin.mongod` releases the lock.
   Applications cannot access the collection during this time.

4. **Completion**

   The :binary:`~bin.mongod` marks the index as ready to use
   and releases all locks taken by the index build process.

For a detailed description of index build locking behavior, see
:ref:`index-build-process`. For more information on MongoDB locking
behavior, see :doc:`/faq/concurrency`.

Behavior
--------

MongoDB 4.2 index builds fully replace the index build processes
supported in previous MongoDB versions. MongoDB ignores the
``background`` index build option if specified to
:dbcommand:`createIndexes` or its shell helpers
:method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` and
:method:`~db.collection.createIndexes()`.

.. admonition:: Requires featureCompatibilityVersion 4.2
   :class: note

   For MongoDB clusters upgraded from 4.0 to 4.2, you must set the
   :ref:`feature compatibility version (fcv) <view-fcv>` to ``4.2``
   to enable the optimized build process. For more information on
   setting the fCV, see :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`.

   MongoDB 4.2 clusters running with fCV ``4.0`` only support 4.0 index
   builds.

Comparison to Foreground and Background Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previous versions of MongoDB supported building indexes either in the
foreground or background. Foreground index builds were fast and produced
more efficient index data structures, but required blocking all
read-write access to the parent database of the collection being indexed
for the duration of the build. Background index builds were slower and
had less efficient results, but allowed read-write access to the
database and its collections during the build process.

.. versionchanged:: MongoDB 4.2

MongoDB 4.2 index builds obtain an exclusive lock on only the collection
being indexed during the start and end of the build process to protect
metadata changes. The rest of the build process uses the yielding
behavior of background index builds to maximize read-write access to the
collection during the build. 4.2 index builds still produce efficient 
index data structures despite the more permissive locking behavior.

MongoDB 4.2 index build performance is at least on par with background
index builds. For workloads with few or no updates received during the
build process, 4.2 index builds builds can be as fast as a foreground
index build on that same data.

Use :method:`db.currentOp()` to monitor  the progress of ongoing index
builds. 

.. _index-build-constraint-violation:

Constraint Violations During Index Build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For indexes that enforce constraints on the collection, such as
:doc:`unique </core/index-unique>` indexes, the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
checks all pre-existing and concurrently-written documents for
violations of those constraints *after* the index build completes.
Documents that violate the index constraints can exist during the index
build. If any documents violate the index constraints at the end of the
build, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` terminates the build and throws an
error.

For example, consider a populated collection ``inventory``. An
administrator wants to create a unique index on the ``product_sku``
field. If any documents in the collection have duplicate values for
``product_sku``, the index build can still start successfully. 
If any violations still exist at the end of the build, 
the :binary:`~bin.mongod` terminates the build and throws an error. 

Similarly, an application can successfully write documents to the
``inventory`` collection with duplicate values of ``product_sku`` while
the index build is in progress. If any violations still exist at the end
of the build,  the :binary:`~bin.mongod` terminates the build and throws
an error. 

To mitigate the risk of index build failure due to constraint
violations:

- Validate that no documents in the collection violate the index
  constraints.

- Stop all writes to the collection from applications that cannot
  guarantee violation-free write operations.

Index Build Impact on Database Performance
------------------------------------------

Index Builds During Write-Heavy Workloads
  Building indexes during time periods where the target collection
  is under heavy write load can result in reduced write 
  performance and longer index builds.

  Consider designating a maintenance window during which applications
  stop or reduce write operations against the collection. Start the
  index build during this maintenance window to mitigate the
  potential negative impact of the build process.

Insufficient Available System Memory (RAM)
  .. include:: /includes/fact-index-build-default-memory-limit.rst

  If the host machine has limited available free RAM, you may need
  to schedule a maintenance period to increase the total system RAM
  before you can modify the :binary:`~bin.mongod` RAM usage.

.. _index-operations-replicated-build:

Index Builds in Replicated Environments
---------------------------------------

To minimize the impact of building an index on:

- Replica Sets, use a rolling index build procedure as described in
  :doc:`/tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets`.

- Sharded Clusters with Shard Replica Sets, use a rolling index build
  procedure as described in
  :doc:`/tutorial/build-indexes-on-sharded-clusters`.
  
You can alternatively start the index build on the :term:`primary`. Once
the index build completes, the secondaries replicate and start the index
build. Consider the following risks *before* starting a replicated index
build:

Secondaries May Fall Out of Sync
  Secondary index builds block the application of replicated
  transactions on a sharded cluster *if* that transaction includes 
  writes to the collection being indexed. Similarly, replicated metadata 
  operations against the collection being indexed also stall behind the
  index build. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` cannot apply any further 
  oplog entries until the index build completes. 

  Replicated write operation to the collection being indexed can also
  stall behind the index build *if* the index build is holding an
  exclusive lock at the time of the operation or command. The
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` cannot apply any further oplog entries until the
  index build releases the exclusive lock. If replication stalls for
  longer than the :ref:`oplog window <replica-set-oplog-sizing>` on that
  secondary, the secondary falls out of sync and requires
  :ref:`resynchronization <replica-set-initial-sync>` to recover.

  Use :method:`rs.printReplicationInfo()` on each replica set member to 
  validate the time covered by the oplog size configured for that
  member *prior* to starting the index build. You can 
  :doc:`increase the oplog size </tutorial/change-oplog-size>` 
  to mitigate the likelihood of a secondary falling out of sync.
  For example, setting an oplog window size that can cover
  72 hours of operations ensures that secondaries can tolerate at least
  that much replication lag.

  Alternatively, build indexes during a maintenance window in which
  applications cease issuing distributed transactions, write operations,
  or metadata commands that affect the collection being indexed. 

Secondary Index Builds May Stall Read and Write Operations
  MongoDB 4.2 index builds obtain an exclusive lock on the collection
  being indexed at the start and end of the build process. While
  a secondary index build holds the exclusive lock, any read or
  write operations that depends on the secondary stall until the
  build releases that lock.

Secondaries Process Index Drops After Index Build Completes
  Dropping the index on the primary before secondaries
  complete the replicated index build does not kill the secondary index
  builds. When the secondary replicates the index drop, it must wait
  until *after* the index build completes to apply the drop.
  Furthermore, since index drops are a metadata operation on the
  collection, the index drop stalls replication on that secondary.

Build Failure and Recovery
--------------------------

Interrupted Index Builds on Standalone ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` shuts down during the index build, the
index build job and all progress is lost. Restarting the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` does not restart the index build. You must
re-issue the :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` operation to restart
the index build.

Interrupted Index Builds on a Primary ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the primary shuts down or steps down during the index build, the
index build job and all progress is lost. Restarting the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` does not restart the index build. You must
re-issue the :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()` operation to
restart the index build.

Interrupted Index Builds on a Secondary ``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a secondary shuts down during the index build, the index build job is
persisted. Restarting the :binary:`~bin.mongod` recovers the index build
and restarts it **from scratch**.

The startup process stalls behind any recovered index builds. All other
operations, including replication, wait until the index builds complete.
If the secondary's oplog does not cover the time required to complete
the index build, the secondary may fall out of sync with the rest of the
replica set and require 
:ref:`resynchronization <replica-set-initial-sync>`.

If you restart the :binary:`~bin.mongod` as a standalone
(i.e. removing or commenting out :setting:`replication.replSetName`
or omitting :option:`--replSetName <mongod --replSet>`), the 
``mongod`` still recovers the index build **from scratch**. You can use 
the :setting:`storage.indexBuildRetry` configuration file setting or 
:option:`--noIndexBuildRetry <mongod --noIndexBuildRetry>` command line
option to skip the index build on start up.

.. admonition:: MongoDB 4.0+
   :class: note

   You cannot specify :setting:`storage.indexBuildRetry` or
   :option:`--noIndexBuildRetry <mongod --noIndexBuildRetry>` for a
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` that is part of a replica set.

Rollbacks during Build Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB waits for any in-progress index builds
to finish before starting a 
:doc:`rollback </core/replica-set-rollbacks>`.

Index Consistency Checks for Sharded Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2.6, the :doc:`config server
</core/sharded-cluster-config-servers>` primary periodically checks for
index inconsistencies across the shards for sharded collections. To
configure these periodic checks, see
:parameter:`enableShardedIndexConsistencyCheck` and
:parameter:`shardedIndexConsistencyCheckIntervalMS`.

The command :dbcommand:`serverStatus` returns the field
:serverstatus:`shardedIndexConsistency` to report on index
inconsistencies when run on the config server primary.

Monitor In Progress Index Builds
--------------------------------

To see the status of an index build operation, you can use the
:method:`db.currentOp()` method in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. To
filter the current operations for index creation operations, see
:ref:`currentOp-index-creation` for an example.

The :data:`~currentOp.msg` field includes a percentage-complete
measurement of the current stage in the index build process. 

Terminate In Progress Index Builds
----------------------------------

To terminate an ongoing index build on a primary or standalone
``mongod``, use the :method:`db.killOp()` method in the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell. When terminating an index build, the effects
of :method:`db.killOp()` may not be immediate and may occur well after
much of the index build operation has completed.

You cannot terminate a *replicated* index build on secondary members of
a replica set. You must first :method:`drop <db.collection.dropIndex()>`
the index on the primary. The secondaries will replicate the drop
operation and drop the indexes *after* the index build completes.
All further replication blocks behind the index build and drop.

sets and sharded clusters with replica set shards, see:

- :doc:`/tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets`
- :doc:`/tutorial/build-indexes-on-sharded-clusters`

.. _index-build-process:

Index Build Process
-------------------

The following table describes each stage of the index build
process:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1
  :widths: 30 70

  * - Stage
    - Description

  * - Lock

    - The :binary:`~bin.mongod` obtains an exclusive ``X`` lock on the
      the collection being indexed. This blocks all read and write 
      operations on the collection, including the application
      of any replicated write operations or metadata commands that
      target the collection. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` does not yield 
      this lock. 

  * - Initialization

    - The :binary:`~bin.mongod` creates three data structures 
      at this initial state:

      - The initial index metadata entry.
      - A temporary table ("side writes table") that stores keys
        generated from writes to the collection being indexed
        during the build process.
      - A temporary table ("constraint violation table") for all 
        documents that may cause a duplicate-key constraint violation.

  * - Lock

    - The :binary:`~bin.mongod` downgrades the exclusive ``X`` 
      collection lock to an intent exclusive
      ``IX`` lock. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` periodically yields
      this lock to  interleaving read and write operations.

  * - Scan Collection

    - For each document in the collection, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` 
      generates a key for that document and dumps the 
      key into an external sorter.

      If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` encounters a duplicate key
      error while generating a key during the collection scan,
      it stores that key in the constraint violation table for later
      processing.

      If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` encounters any other error while
      generating a key, the build fails with an error.

      Once the :binary:`~bin.mongod` completes the collection
      scan, it dumps the sorted keys into the index.

  * - Process Side Writes Table

    - The :binary:`~bin.mongod` drains the side write table using
      first-in-first-out priority.

      If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` encounters a duplicate key 
      error while processing a key in the side write table, it
      stores that key in the constraint violation table for later
      processing.

      If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` encounters any other error while
      processing a key, the build fails with an error.

      For each document written to the collection during the build
      process, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` generates a key for that
      document and stores it in the side write table for later
      processing. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` uses a snapshot system to set
      a limit to the number of keys to process. 

  * - Lock

    - The :binary:`~bin.mongod` upgrades the intent exclusive ``IX`` 
      lock on the collection to a shared ``S`` lock. This 
      blocks all write operations to the collection, including the
      application of any replicated write operations or metadata
      commands that target the collection.

  * - Finish Processing Temporary Side Writes Table

    - The :binary:`~bin.mongod` continues draining remaining 
      records in the side writes table. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` may 
      pause replication  during this stage.

      If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` encounters a duplicate key 
      error while processing a key in the side write table, it
      stores that key in the constraint violation table for later
      processing.

      If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` encounters any other error while
      processing a key, the build fails with an error.

  * - Lock

    - The :binary:`~bin.mongod` upgrades the shared ``S`` lock on the 
      collection to an exclusive ``X`` lock on the collection. This 
      blocks all read and write operations on the collection, including 
      the application of any replicated write operations or metadata 
      commands that target the collection. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` 
      does not yield this lock. 

  * - Drop Side Write Table

    - The :binary:`~bin.mongod` applies any remaining 
      operations in the side writes table before dropping it. 

      If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` encounters a duplicate key 
      error while processing a key in the side write table, it
      stores that key in the constraint violation table for later
      processing.

      If the :binary:`~bin.mongod` encounters any other error while
      processing a key, the build fails with an error.

      At this point, the index includes all data written to
      the collection.

  * - Process Constraint Violation Table

    - The :binary:`~bin.mongod` drains the constraint violation table
      using first-in-first-out priority. The :binary:`~bin.mongod`
      then drops the table.

      If any key in the constraint violation table still produces a
      duplicate key error, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` aborts the build
      and throws an error.

      The :binary:`~bin.mongod` drops the constraint violation table
      once it is drained *or* if it encounters a duplicate key violation
      during processing.

  * - Mark the Index as Ready

    - The :binary:`~bin.mongod` updates the index metadata to 
      mark the index as ready for use.

  * - Lock

    - The :binary:`~bin.mongod` releases the ``X`` lock on the 
      collection.
