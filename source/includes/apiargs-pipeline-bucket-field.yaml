description: |
   An :ref:`expression <aggregation-expressions>` to group documents 
   by. To specify a :ref:`field path<agg-quick-ref-field-paths>`,
   prefix the field name with a dollar sign ``$`` and enclose it in 
   quotes.
   
   Unless :pipeline:`$bucket` includes a ``default``
   specification, each input document must resolve the
   ``groupBy`` field path or expression to a value that falls
   within one of the ranges specified by the ``boundaries``.

name: boundaries
position: 2
type: array
description: |
   An array of values based on the ``groupBy`` expression that specify
   the boundaries for each bucket. Each adjacent pair of values acts
   as the inclusive lower boundary and the exclusive upper boundary 
   for the bucket. You must specify at least two boundaries.
   
   The specified values must be in ascending order and all of the same
   :doc:`type </reference/bson-types>`. The exception is if the values
   are of mixed numeric types, such as:
   
   ``[ 10, NumberLong(20), NumberInt(30) ]``
   
   If the values are documents, they must be wrapped in the 
   :expression:`$literal` operator.
  
   .. example:: 
      
      An array of ``[ 0, 5, 10 ]`` creates two buckets:
   
      - [0, 5) with inclusive lower bound ``0`` and exclusive upper
        bound ``5``.
   
      - [5, 10) with inclusive lower bound ``5`` and exclusive upper 
        bound ``10``.

name: default
position: 3
type: literal
description: |
   A literal that specifies the ``_id`` of an additional bucket that
   contains all documents whose ``groupBy`` expression result does not 
   fall into a bucket specified by ``boundaries``.
   
   If unspecified, each input document must resolve the
   ``groupBy`` expression to a value within one of the bucket ranges 
   specified by ``boundaries`` or the operation throws an error.

   The ``default`` value cannot overlap with a bucket; i.e. must
   be less than the lowest ``boundaries`` value or greater than the
   highest ``boundaries`` value.
   
   The ``default`` value can be of a different
   :doc:`type </reference/bson-types>` than the entries in 
   ``boundaries``.

name: output
position: 4
type: document
description: |
   A document that specifies the fields to include in the output
   documents in addition to the ``_id`` field. To specify the field to
   include, you must use
   :ref:`accumulator expressions<agg-quick-reference-accumulators>`.
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      <outputfield1>: { <accumulator>: <expression1> },
      ...
      <outputfieldN>: { <accumulator>: <expressionN> }
      
   The default ``count`` field is not included in the output document
   when ``output`` is specified. Explicitly specify the ``count`` 
   expression as part of the output document to include it:
     
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      output: { 
        <outputField1>: { <accumulator>: <expression1> },
        ...
        "count": { $sum: 1 }
      }
