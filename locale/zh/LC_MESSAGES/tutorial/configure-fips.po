"The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is a U.S. government "
"computer security standard used to certify software modules and libraries "
"that encrypt and decrypt data securely.  You can configure MongoDB to run "
"with a FIPS 140-2 certified library for OpenSSL. Configure FIPS to run by "
"default or as needed from the command line."
