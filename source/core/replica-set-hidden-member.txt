Hidden Replica Set Members
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

A hidden member contains a copy of the :term:`primary's <primary>` data
set but is **invisible** to client applications. Hidden members are
ideal for instances that have different use patterns from the other
members in the :term:`replica set`. Hidden members are also
:ref:`priority 0 members <replica-set-secondary-only-members>` and
**cannot become primary**. The :method:`db.isMaster()` method will not
display hidden members. Hidden members, however, **do vote** in
:ref:`elections <replica-set-elections>`.

In the following five-member replica set, all four secondary
members have copies of the primary's data set, but one of secondary
members is hidden.

Secondary reads do not reach a hidden member, so the member receives no
traffic beyond what replication requires. Use hidden members for
instances that require separation from normal traffic. For example, you
might use hidden members for instances dedicated to reporting or to
backups.
For dedicated backup, ensure that the hidden member is close within
the network to the primary or likely primary. Ensure that
the :term:`replication lag` is minimal or non-existent. For more
information about backing up MongoDB databases, see
:doc:`/core/backups`.

To configure a hidden member, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-a-hidden-replica-set-member`.
