If your source cluster uses Persistent Query Settings (PQS), you must manually
migrate those settings to your destination cluster to finalize sync. 

``mongosync`` checks for PQS during initialization and the :ref:`cutover process
<c2c-cutover-process>`. If ``mongosync`` finds PQS on the source cluster during
cutover, {+c2c-product-name+} shows a warning. Use the following procedure to
address the warning and migrate your PQS to your destination cluster.

Steps 
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Export your Persistent Query Settings.

      Run the following code block to output your query settings into an array:

      .. code-block:: shell

         mongosh --eval
         'console.log(db.aggregate([{$querySettings:{}}]).toArray())'

   .. step:: Import your PQS to the destination cluster.

      For each query setting that you want to migrate, use
      :dbcommand:`setQuerySettings` to apply that setting to your destination
      cluster. 
      
      If the query setting includes a ``representativeQuery`` field value, use
      that field value as the ``setQuerySettings`` value. 
      
      Otherwise, use the ``queryShapeHash`` field value from the
      ``querySettings`` array as the ``setQuerySettings`` value.
