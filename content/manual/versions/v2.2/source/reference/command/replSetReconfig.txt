.. dbcommand:: replSetReconfig

   The :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` command modifies the configuration
   of an existing replica set. You can use this command to add and
   remove members, and to alter the options set on existing
   members. Use the following syntax:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { replSetReconfig: <new_config_document>, force: false }

   You may also run the command using the shell's :method:`rs.reconfig()` method.

   Be aware of the following :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` behaviors:

   - You must issue this command against the :term:`admin database` of the current
     primary member of the replica set.

   - You can optionally force the replica set to accept the new
     configuration by specifying ``force: true``. Use this option if
     the current member is not primary or if a majority of the members
     of the set are not accessible.

     .. warning::

        Forcing the :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` command can lead to a
        :term:`rollback` situation. Use with caution.

     Use the force option to restore a replica set to new servers with
     different hostnames. This works even if the set members already
     have a copy of the data.

   - A majority of the set's members must be operational for the
     changes to propagate properly.

   - This command can cause downtime as the set renegotiates
     primary-status. Typically this is 10-20 seconds, but could
     be as long as a minute or more. Therefore, you should attempt
     to reconfigure only during scheduled maintenance periods.

   - In some cases, :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` forces the current
     primary to step down, initiating an election for primary among
     the members of the replica set. When this happens, the set will
     drop all current connections.

   .. note::

      :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` obtains a special mutually
      exclusive lock to prevent more than one
      :dbcommand:`replSetReconfig` operation from occurring at the same
      time.
