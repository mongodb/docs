Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to access data with a **cursor**.

A cursor is a mechanism that allows an application to iterate over
database results while holding only a subset of them in memory at a
given time. Read operations that match multiple documents use a cursor
to return those documents in batches rather than all at once.

Sample Cursor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each section uses the following ``cursor`` variable, which is a
``Cursor`` struct that contains all the documents in a collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin cursor def
   :end-before: end cursor def

In the examples in this guide, the driver unmarshals documents held in
the ``cursor`` variable to a sample ``MyStruct`` struct.

.. important::

   A cursor is not `goroutine <https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/10>`__ safe. Do not use the same cursor in
   multiple goroutines at the same time.

.. _golang-individual-documents:

Retrieve Documents Individually
-------------------------------

To retrieve documents from your cursor individually while blocking the
current goroutine, use the ``Next()`` method.

The method returns a document if all of the following conditions are met:

- A document is currently or will later be available.
- The driver didn't throw any errors.
- The context didn't expire.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin cursor next
   :end-before: end cursor next

Tailable Cursor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To attempt retrieving a document from a :manual:`tailable cursor
</core/tailable-cursors/>`, use the ``TryNext()`` method.

The method returns a document if all of the following conditions are met:

- A document is currently available.
- The driver didn't throw any errors.
- The context didn't expire.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin cursor try next
   :end-before: end cursor try next

.. _golang-all-documents:

Retrieve All Documents
----------------------

To populate an array with all of your query results, use the ``All()``
method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin cursor all
   :end-before: end cursor all

.. important:: Memory

   If the number and size of documents returned by your query exceeds
   available application memory, your program will crash. If you except
   a large result set, you should :ref:`consume your cursor iteratively
   <golang-individual-documents>`.

Close the Cursor
----------------

When your application no longer requires a cursor, close the cursor
with the ``Close()`` method. This method frees the resources your cursor
consumes in both the client application and the MongoDB server.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/cursor.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin close
   :end-before: end close

.. note:: 

   Close the cursor when you :ref:`retrieve documents individually
   <golang-individual-documents>` because those methods make a cursor
   :manual:`tailable </core/tailable-cursors/>`.
