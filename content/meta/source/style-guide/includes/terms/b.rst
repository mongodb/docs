   bi (prefix)
     Don't hyphenate words that begin with the prefix *bi*, such as
     *bidirectional* and *bimodal*, unless the root word starts with
     an *i* or a capital letter.

   billion
     :icon-fa4:`times-circle` *Billion* indicates different
     numbers in different numeration systems. In the short-scale
     system (used in the English-speaking countries), it indicates 10
     :sup:`9`, or 1,000,000,000. In the long-scale system (used in
     Spanish-speaking countries), it indicates 10 :sup:`12`, or
     1,000,000,000,000.

     To avoid confusion when you're citing a large number such as a
     billion, express the amount in numerals. If space constraints
     prevent writing numerals, use *billion* as defined in the
     short-scale system.

   biweekly
     **bimonthly**
     :icon-fa4:`times-circle` Because these terms can be interpreted
     as *twice a week or month* or *once every two weeks or months*,
     avoid using them. For clarity, instead use longer terms such as
     *every two weeks*, *every two months*, *twice a week*, and *twice
     a month*.

   blacklist
     :icon-fa4:`times-circle` Don't use. Use *access list* as a noun
     and *remove from an access list* as a verb. Use *blocked* as an
     adjective.

            entries, and edit or delete existing blacklist entries.

   bottom left
     **bottom right**
     :icon-fa5:`trash-alt` When referring to the location of an item
     on a UI, use :term:`lower left` and :term:`lower right 
     <lower left>` instead.

     .. seealso::

   box
     Use *box* instead of *field* to describe a box (including a text
     box, list box, group box, combo box, and spin box) within a
     dialog box or window. When citing a specific UI element name,
     use only box with the name (for example, **Candidate** box, not
     **Candidate** list box) except when naming a check box. In
     contrast, when citing one of these terms generically, use the
     complete term, such as *list box*.

     .. note::
        Don't use *box* to refer to a computer.

     of a UI. Use *open* instead.

   button
     Don't use *button* and *icon* interchangeably. If you're
     referring to a command button or toolbar button (labeled or
     unlabeled), use *button*. If you're referring to a graphic on a
     screen, window, or other area, use *icon*.

     When providing an instruction to click a button that executes a
     command, use the name of the button without the word *button*.
