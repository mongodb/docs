Introduction
------------

To access a cluster you must connect from an IP address on the cluster's
whitelist. If you have not done so, :ref:`add your IP address to the whitelist
<add-to-whitelist>`. You can also add an IP address to the whitelist when
retrieving connection information.

You can connect to a cluster through either the ``mongo`` shell or through a
MongoDB driver.


.. TO ADD:: Need to add info on how to get the **customized** mongo shell.
