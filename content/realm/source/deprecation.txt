Atlas Device SDKs Deprecation
=============================

As of September 2024, Atlas Device SDKs are deprecated. Atlas Device SDKs will
reach end-of-life and be removed on **September 30, 2025**. 

The Atlas Device SDKs are made up of two parts: the on-device database and
Atlas Device Sync. The on-device database will continue to exist as an open
source project.

Atlas Device Sync is deprecated. This means that apps built using Sync need to
move to an alternative solution or remove Sync before September 30, 2025. Refer
to the :ref:`App Services deprecation page <app-services-deprecation>` for more
information.

Additional Impacted App Services Capabilities
---------------------------------------------

Some App Services are affected by the deprecation of the Device SDKs. These
services will no longer function as expected when the SDKs reach end-of-life and
are not supported.

Authentication and User Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Device SDKs are the primary entry point for :ref:`App Services
Authentication and User Management <users-and-authentication>`, an
authentication service for your applications. As part of the SDK deprecation,
this feature will no longer be available when the SDKs reach end-of-life and are
removed. You must move to an alternative authentication service before that time
to avoid disruption in your application.

The feature supports multiple :ref:`authentication providers 
<authentication-providers>`, and your migration to alternative solutions depends
on your provider. To identify the best alternative for your use case, please
contact your Account team.

Given App Services Authentication is no longer available, Authentication
Triggers will no longer be executed when user events (for example: login or
create) occur. This authentication logic will need to be implemented along with 
the chosen alternative solution.

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

Functions will continue to be available within the context of Triggers. Use
cases where a function was being directly accessed through a Realm SDK are
impacted and must migrate to a different solution. 

Wire Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services Wire Protocol is also deprecated alongside the Realm SDKs.

Data Access Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data Access Permissions (Rules and Roles) are also deprecated alongside Device
Sync.

Device SDKs Community Branches
------------------------------

The Device SDKs will have community branches that remove Device Sync code from
their codebases. Check out the community branches for the following SDKs:

- `C++ <https://github.com/realm/realm-cpp/tree/community>`__
- `Flutter <https://github.com/realm/realm-dart/tree/community>`__
- `Kotlin <https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/tree/community>`__
- `.NET <https://github.com/realm/realm-dotnet/tree/community>`__
- `JavaScript <https://github.com/realm/realm-js/tree/community>`__
- `Swift <https://github.com/realm/realm-swift/tree/community>`__
