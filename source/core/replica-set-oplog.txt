Replica Set Oplog
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The :term:`oplog` (operations log) is a special :term:`capped
collection` that keeps a rolling record of all operations that modify
the data stored in your databases. MongoDB applies database operations
on the :term:`primary` and then records the operations on the
primary's oplog. The :term:`secondary` members then copy and apply
these operations in an asynchronous process. All replica set members
contain a copy of the oplog, in the :data:`local.oplog.rs` collection,
which allows them to maintain the current state of the database.

To facilitate replication, all replica set members send heartbeats
(pings) to all other members. Any member can import oplog entries from
any other member.

Whether applied once or multiple times to the target dataset, each
operation in the oplog produces the same results, i.e. each operation
in the oplog is :term:`idempotent`. For proper replication operations,
entries in the oplog must be idempotent:

- initial sync
- post-rollback catch-up
- sharding chunk migrations

.. _replica-set-oplog-sizing:

Oplog Size
----------

When you start a replica set member for the first time, MongoDB creates
an oplog of a default size. The size depends on the architectural
details of your operating system.

In most cases, the default oplog size is sufficient. For example, if an
oplog is 5% of free disk space and fills up in 24 hours of operations, then
secondaries can stop copying entries from the oplog for up to 24 hours
without becoming too stale to continue replicating. However, most
replica sets have much lower operation volumes, and their oplogs can
hold much higher numbers of operations.

Before :program:`mongod` creates an oplog, you can specify its size
with the :setting:`~replication.oplogSizeMB` option. However, after you have started
a replica set member for the first time, you can only change the size
of the oplog using the :doc:`/tutorial/change-oplog-size` procedure.

..  Actual oplog sizing as of 2012-07-02:
..  32 bit systems = ~48 megabytes
..  64 bit = larger of 5% of disk or ~1 gigabyte
..  64 bit OS X = ~183 megabytes

By default, the size of the oplog is as follows:

- For 64-bit Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and Windows systems, MongoDB
  allocates 5% of the available free disk space, but will always
  allocate at least 1 gigabyte and never more than 50 gigabytes.

- For 64-bit OS X systems, MongoDB allocates 183 megabytes of space to
  the oplog.

- For 32-bit systems, MongoDB allocates about 48 megabytes of space to
  the oplog.

Workloads that Might Require a Larger Oplog Size
------------------------------------------------

If you can predict your replica set's workload to resemble one of the
following patterns, then you might want to create an oplog that is
larger than the default. Conversely, if your application predominantly
performs reads with a minimal amount of write operations, a smaller oplog
may be sufficient.

The following workloads might require a larger oplog size.

Updates to Multiple Documents at Once
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The oplog must translate multi-updates into individual operations in
order to maintain :term:`idempotency <idempotent>`. This can use a great
deal of oplog space without a corresponding increase in data size or disk
use.

Deletions Equal the Same Amount of Data as Inserts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you delete roughly the same amount of data as you insert, the
database will not grow significantly in disk use, but the size
of the operation log can be quite large.

Significant Number of In-Place Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a significant portion of the workload is in-place updates, the database
records a large number of operations but does not change the quantity of
data on disk.

Oplog Status
------------

To view oplog status, including the size and the time range of
operations, issue the :method:`rs.printReplicationInfo()` method. For
more information on oplog status, see
:ref:`replica-set-troubleshooting-check-oplog-size`.

Under various exceptional situations, updates to a :term:`secondary's
<secondary>` oplog might lag behind the desired performance time.  Use
:method:`db.getReplicationInfo()` from a secondary member and the
:doc:`replication status </reference/method/db.getReplicationInfo>`
output to assess the current state of replication and determine if
there is any unintended replication delay.

See :ref:`Replication Lag <replica-set-replication-lag>` for more
information.
