.. note:: Alpha Release

   The Kotlin driver is currently in alpha release and available only for evaluation purposes,
   to validate functionality, and to gather feedback.
   It is not recommended for production deployments as we may introduce breaking changes.
   This feature doesn't include formal consulting, SLAs, or technical support obligations.

Introduction
------------

Welcome to the documentation site for the Kotlin Driver, the official
MongoDB driver for server-side Kotlin applications using coroutines. Download it using
`Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ or
`Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__, or set up a runnable project by
following our Quick Start guide.

If your Kotlin application requires synchronous processing, use the
`Sync Driver <{+api-kotlin+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-kotlin-sync/>`__ which uses synchronous operations
to make blocking calls to MongoDB.

Quick Start
-----------

Learn how to establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas and begin
working with data in the :doc:`Quick Start </quick-start>` section.

Quick Reference
---------------

See driver syntax examples for common MongoDB commands in the
:ref:`Quick Reference <kotlin-quick-reference>` section.

Usage Examples
--------------

For fully runnable code snippets and explanations for common
methods, see the :doc:`Usage Examples </usage-examples>` section.
