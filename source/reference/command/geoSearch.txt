.. dbcommand:: geoSearch

   The :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command provides an interface to
   MongoDB's :term:`haystack index` functionality. These indexes are
   useful for returning results based on location coordinates *after*
   collecting results based on some other query (i.e. a "haystack.")

   The :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command accepts a :term:`document` that
   contains the following fields.
   
   .. include:: /includes/apiargs/dbcommand-geoSearch-field.rst

Behavior
--------

Unless specified otherwise, the :dbcommand:`geoSearch` command
limits results to 50 documents.

.. important:: :dbcommand:`geoSearch` is not supported for sharded
   clusters.

Examples
--------

Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand({
      geoSearch : "places", 
      near: [ -73.9667, 40.78 ],
      maxDistance : 6,
      search : { type : "restaurant" },
      limit : 30
   })

The above command returns all documents with a ``type`` of
``restaurant`` having a maximum distance of 6 units from the
coordinates ``[ -73.9667, 40.78 ]`` in the collection ``places`` up to a
maximum of 30 results.

Override Default Read Concern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To override the default read concern level of :readconcern:`"local"`,
use the ``readConcern`` option.

The following operation on a replica set specifies a
:doc:`/reference/read-concern` of :readconcern:`"majority"` to read the
most recent copy of the data confirmed as having been written to a
majority of the nodes.

   db.runCommand(

         near: [ -73.9667, 40.78 ],
         search : { type : "restaurant" },
         readConcern: { level: "majority" }
       }
