Manage Alert Configuration
==========================

Overview
--------

You can manage alert configurations from the :guilabel:`Activity` tab.
An alert configuration defines the conditions that trigger an alert and
defines the notifications to be sent.

.. I've edited the above to distinguish between alerts and alert
   configurations, per Mike Benoit's comments on pull 249 for ticket 2498.

Manage Alert Configurations
---------------------------

View Alert Configurations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

To view alert configurations, click the :guilabel:`Activity` tab and then
select the :guilabel:`Alert Settings` page.

Alert configurations define the conditions that trigger alerts and the
notifications sent when alerts are triggered.

|mms| creates the following alert configurations automatically when you create a
new group:

- Users awaiting approval to join group

- Host is exposed to the public internet

- User added to group

- Monitoring Agent is down

If you enable backup, |mms| creates the following alert configurations for the
group if they do not already exist:

- Oplog Behind

- Resync Required

- Cluster Mongos Is Missing

Create or Clone an Alert Configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To create or clone an alert configuration, see
:doc:`/tutorial/create-alert`.

Modify an Alert Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each alert configuration has a distribution list, a frequency for sending
the alert, and a waiting period after an alert state triggers before
sending the first alert.

By default, an alert configuration sends alerts at 60-minute intervals.
You can modify the interval. The minimum interval is 5 minutes.

.. START-COMMENT

   Per Mike Benoit 12/17/2013, mms-docs Pull 80: The reason for the 5 minute
   minimum is that our alert processing job only executes every five minutes.
   Thus, setting this lower than 5 minutes wouldn't have any impact. This also
   means that only multiples of 5 make sense for this value.

Delete an Alert Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/steps/alerts-delete.rst

When you delete an alert configuration that has open alerts associated to
it, |mms| cancels the open alerts and sends no further notifications. This
is true whether users have acknowledged the alerts or not.

Disable or Enable an Alert Configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/steps/alerts-disable-enable.rst

When you disable an alert configuration it remains visible in a
*grayed out* state. |mms| automatically cancels active
alerts related to a disabled alert configuration.
You can reactivate disabled alerts.

For example, if you have an alert configured for *Host Down* and you currently
have an active alert telling you a host is down, |mms| automatically
cancels active *Host Down*  alerts if you disable the default
*Host Down* configuration. |mms| will send no further alerts
of this type unless the disabled alert is re-enabled.
