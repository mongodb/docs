The following types of lists are commonly used in documentation:

- **Ordered lists** or numbered lists. The list items must be
  performed or considered in a particular order.
- **Unordered lists** or bulleted lists. The order of the list items
  isn't important.

Introductory Text
-----------------

Introduce a list with context. In most cases, you use a sentence;
you can introduce procedures with a heading. Use the following
guidelines when introducing lists.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Guideline
     - Example

   * - Introduce a list with a sentence, and end the sentence with a
       colon. If another sentence intervenes between the introductory
       sentence and the list, end the introductory sentence with a
       period instead of a colon.

       .. note::
          Avoid using fragments to introduce lists. Fragments can be
          harder to understand than sentences.

       must extract objects from the database to complete these tasks.

   * - For a partial list only, use the verb *include* in the
       introductory text.
     - The directory includes the following files:

       (*Includes* is correct only if you're listing some, but not all,
       files in the directory.)

   * - Don't quantify items in introductory text. Quantifying items
       could cause an error if the list changes.
     - *Use:*

   * - Don’t tell users to "do the following." The verb *do* is weak,
       using *following* as a noun in this context is incorrect, and
       the whole phrase is ambiguous.

       Use a stronger and more meaningful verb. Use *following* only as
       an adjective, unless you're referring to an entourage, posse,
       retinue, or group of fans. Ensure that the introduction to a
       list provides enough context for users to understand what
       information the list is providing.

List Items
----------

Use the following guidelines when writing list items:

-  Capitalize the first letter of each list item unless the first
   letter must be lowercase.
-  Make all list items parallel. For example, all items start with
   fragments, or all items use sentences. A list can have a mix of
   fragments and sentences as long as all of the items start with a
   fragment.
-  Punctuate list items as follows:

   -  In a list of only sentences, including imperative statements, use
      punctuation at the end of each item.
   -  In a list of only fragments, use no punctuation at the end of
      each item.
   -  In a list of fragments, some or all of which are followed by
      sentences, use punctuation at the end of every fragment and
      sentence in the list.

-  Don't connect separate list items with commas or conjunctions
   (*and*, *or*).

-  Avoid using articles (*a*, *an*, *the*) to start list items.

-  When a list provides a series of terms or phrases and then more
   information about them, format the list as follows:

   -  Show the term or phrase in bold. Using bold makes the list easier
      to scan.
   -  If you need to separate the initial term or phrase from the
      information that follows it, use a colon. However, if you don't
      need a separator, don't use one. (For an example of a list in
      which separators aren't necessary, see the list at the top of
      this topic.)

-  Unless another order makes sense or is preferable, alphabetize list
   items.

List Examples
-------------

The following sections show examples of the indicated types of lists.

All List Items Are Sentences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you create an AWS PrivateLink, the following limitations apply:

- You can use AWS PrivateLink to connect to Atlas clusters running
  MongoDB version 3.6 or later.

- AWS PrivateLink must be active in all regions into which you deploy a
  multi-region cluster. You receive an error if AWS PrivateLink is
  active in some, but not all, targeted regions.

- You can do only one of the following:

  - Create multiple private endpoints in a single region.
  - Create one private endpoint in multiple regions.

  If you create more than one private endpoint in a single region, you
  can’t create private endpoints in other regions.

All List Items Are Fragments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example creates a cluster instance called **my-atlas-cluster** with
the following characteristics:

- M10 tier
- Volume size of 2 GB

All List Items Are Imperative Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use Cloud Backup to perform the following actions:

- Select the databases from your cluster that you want to back
  up.
- Run your backups manually or on a schedule.
- See the activity from all your backups.
- Use AES-256 encryption with a private encryption key that only you
  know.
- Restore individual files and folders from a particular date.
- Save space with incremental backups that save only the changed
  portions of files.
- Create unlimited backups.

List Items Mix Fragments and Sentences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the examples in this guide, the following prerequisites are
required:

- MongoDB Atlas account. To sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account, go to
  the MongoDB Cloud signup page.
- MongoDB username and password that you specified during registration.

List that Provides Terms and More Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating your Atlas cluster, choose one of the following cloud providers:

- **Amazon Web Services**: AWS offers 28 cluster tiers in 18 regions.
- **Microsoft Azure**: Azure offers 16 cluster tiers in 33 regions.
- **Google Cloud Platform**: GCP offers 19 cluster tiers in 21 regions.
