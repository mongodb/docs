"In a replica set, by default all :term:`secondary` members are eligible to "
"become primary through the election process. You can use the :data:`priority"

"To prevent a :term:`secondary` member from ever becoming a :term:`primary` "

"MongoDB does not permit the current :term:`primary` to have a priority of "

"The :method:`rs.reconfig()` shell method can force the current primary to "
"step down, which causes an :ref:`election <replica-set-elections>`. When the"
" primary steps down, the :program:`mongod` closes all client connections. "
"While this typically takes 10-20 seconds, try to make these changes during "
"scheduled maintenance periods."

"To successfully reconfigure a replica set, a majority of the members must be"

"can quickly obtain a majority of votes in an election for primary."
