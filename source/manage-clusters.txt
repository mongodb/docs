Use the following resources to configure and manage |service|
{+clusters+}. These settings don't apply to {+Serverless-instances+}.

Required Access
---------------

To view your {+clusters+}, you must have :authrole:`Project Read Only` access 
or higher to the project.

View Your {+Clusters+}
----------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: atlascli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-list-and-describe.rst

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-clusters-advancedSettings-describe.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: ui

      To view all {+clusters+} in the {+atlas-ui+}, see
      :ref:`view-all-database-deployments`. To view the details for a 
      {+cluster+}, see :ref:`view-cluster-details`.

.. _create-cluster-instance:

Select {+Cluster+} Tier
-----------------------

Select your preferred {+cluster+} tier. The {+cluster+} tier dictates 
the memory, storage, vCPUs, and |iops| specification for each 
data-bearing server [#data-bearing]_ in the {+cluster+}.

.. note::

   You might see different values depending on your
   selected cloud provider and region.

.. _shared-tier-cluster:

Shared and {+Flex-Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use {+Flex-clusters+} or {+Shared-clusters+} as an economical way for getting 
started with MongoDB and for low-throughput applications. These {+clusters+} 
deploy to a shared environment with access to a subset of |service| 
features. To learn more, see :ref:`limits`.

You can deploy one ``M0`` {+cluster+} (free sandbox replica set 
cluster) per |service| project. You can :doc:`upgrade </scale-cluster>` 
an ``M0`` {+Free-cluster+} to a {+Flex-cluster+} or {+Shared-cluster+} 
at any time.

{+Flex-clusters+} and {+Shared-clusters+} provide the following added
features compared to ``M0`` clusters:

- :ref:`Backups <flex-snapshots>` for your {+cluster+} data
- Increased storage
- :doc:`API access </api>`

Considerations
``````````````
{+Flex-clusters+} and {+Shared-clusters+} do not have the full availability of 
features found in {+Dedicated-clusters+}. To learn more, see :ref:`limits`. 

.. _atlas-low-traffic-tier:

{+Dedicated-Clusters+} for Low-Traffic Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``M10`` and ``M20`` {+cluster+} tiers support development environments 
and low-traffic applications.

These clusters support replica set deployments only, but otherwise
provide full access to |service| features.

.. note::

   ``M10`` and ``M20`` {+cluster+} tiers run on a burstable performance
   infrastructure. {+Clusters+} under heavy load may experience CPU throttling.

.. _atlas-high-traffic-tier:

{+Dedicated-Clusters+} for High-Traffic Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``M30`` and higher {+clusters+} are recommended for production
environments.

These clusters support replica set and sharded {+cluster+} deployments 
with full access to |service| features.

Some clusters have variants, denoted by the |angle| character. When you
select these clusters, |service| lists the variants and tags each
{+cluster+} to distinguish their key characteristics.

.. |angle| unicode:: U+276F

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the API to choose a different tier per shard.
Analytics Nodes can also have independently selected tiers on all shards.
The minimum and maximum tier autoscaling configuration must be the same for all shards.
The minimum and maximum shard tiers can be up to two tiers apart.
When editing a sharded cluster with multiple shard tiers in the UI,
changing tier will change the tier of all shards.

You can use the API to choose different IOPS per shard
if the {+cluster+} is on |aws| using |aws| provisioned IOPS
or the {+cluster+} is on |azure| in regions that support Extended IOPS/storage.

Limitations
```````````
Every shard must have an equal disk size on all nodes.
|nvme| {+clusters+} are not compatible with independent shard scaling.


.. _nvme-storage:

NVMe Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For applications hosted on :ref:`AWS <amazon-aws>` or  :ref:`Azure <microsoft-azure>`
that require low-latency and high-throughput I/O, |service| offers storage
options using locally attached ephemeral |nvme| |ssd|\s.

.. include:: /includes/fact-nvme-fcbis.rst

.. note::
   
   |service| doesn't support |nvme| {+clusters+} on |gcp|.
   |nvme| {+clusters+} are not compatible with independent shard scaling.

NVMe Considerations
```````````````````

The following {+cluster+} tiers support |nvme| {+clusters+} on |aws|:

- ``M40``
- ``M50``
- ``M60``
- ``M80``
- ``M200``
- ``M400``

The following {+cluster+} tiers support |nvme| {+clusters+} on |azure|:

- ``M60``
- ``M80``
- ``M200``
- ``M300``
- ``M400``
- ``M600``

|service| supports |nvme| {+clusters+} in the following |azure| regions:

The fixed-value storage space and RAM for an |nvme| {+cluster+}
corresponds to its {+cluster+} tier. To learn more, see 
:ref:`Amazon Cluster Configuration Options
<amazon-aws-configuration-options>` and 
:ref:`Azure Cluster Configuration Options
<microsoft-azure-configuration-options>`.

Clusters with |nvme| storage use :doc:`{+Cloud-Backup+}s 
</backup/cloud-backup/overview>`. You can't disable backup on |nvme| 
clusters. If you want to use hourly backups, |service| limits backups 
on |nvme| clusters to once every 12 hours.

|nvme| clusters use a :manual:`hidden secondary node
</core/replica-set-hidden-member>` that consists of a provisioned 
volume with high throughput and |iops| to facilitate backup.

You can't :ref:`pause <pause-cluster>` an |nvme| {+cluster+}.

NVMe Availability Zones
+++++++++++++++++++++++

|nvme| {+clusters+} in the following |azure| regions have two
:ref:`Availability Zones <microsoft-azure-availability-zones>`:

- ``eastus2``
- ``centralus``
- ``southcentralus``

|nvme| {+clusters+} in all other |azure| regions that 
:ref:`indicate Availability Zones <microsoft-azure-supported-regions>`
have three Availability Zones.

Take the Next Steps
-------------------

You can manage {+clusters+} in the following ways:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Action
     - Description

   * - :doc:`/customize-storage`
     - Customize the storage capacity of your {+cluster+}. Each 
       {+cluster+} tier comes with a default set of resources. ``M10+`` 
       {+clusters+} provide the ability to customize your storage 
       capacity.

   * - :doc:`/cluster-autoscaling`
     - Configure the {+cluster+} tier ranges that |service| uses to
       automatically scale your {+cluster+} tier, storage capacity, or 
       both in response to {+cluster+} usage.

   * - :doc:`/cluster-additional-settings`
     - Configure additional {+cluster+} settings such as MongoDB 
       version, backup, and encryption options.

   * - :ref:`configure-resource-tags`
     - Use resource tags that you provide and manage to categorize 
       resources by purpose, environment, team, or billing center.

   * - :doc:`/scale-cluster`
     - Reconfigure an existing {+cluster+}. Modify any of the available 
       |service| configuration options.

   * - :doc:`/tutorial/major-version-change/`
     - Manage major version upgrades for your {+cluster+}. |service| 
       enables you to upgrade the major version of an |service| 
       {+cluster+} at any time.

   * - :doc:`/tutorial/cluster-maintenance-window/`
     - Configure maintenance windows for your {+cluster+}. You can set 
       the hour of the day that |service| should start weekly 
       maintenance on your {+cluster+}.

   * -  :doc:`/pause-terminate-cluster`
     - Pause, resume, or terminate an existing {+cluster+}. You can't 
       change the configuration of a paused {+cluster+}. Also, you 
       can't read data from or write data to a paused {+cluster+}.

   * - :doc:`/cluster-config/multi-cloud-distribution`
     - Configure multi-cloud distribution for increased availability.
       |service| offers options to improve the availability and 
       workload balancing of your {+cluster+}.

   * - :ref:`replica-set-tags`
     - Use pre-defined replica set tags that |service| provides to 
       direct queries from specific applications to specific node types 
       and regions. To use pre-defined replica set tags in your 
       connection string and direct queries to specific nodes, set the 
       tag in the ``readPreferenceTags`` connection string option.
