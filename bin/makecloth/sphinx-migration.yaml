# These targets use ``touch`` to bump the mtime of directories to
# ensure that all the proper dependencies are built.
# 
# Items in each document are: 
#     - ``target``: the name of the target.
#     - ``dependency``: the name of the dependency. ``None`` is
#       acceptable.
#
# The build system generator will only use the first two items of the
# document in any list.
