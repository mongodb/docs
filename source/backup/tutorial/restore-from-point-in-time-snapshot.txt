Restore from a Point in the Last 24 Hours
=========================================

.. start-content

With the MongoDB Backup Service, you can restore from any point within
a 24-hour period as well as :doc:`restore from a stored snapshot
</backup/tutorial/restore-from-snapshot>`.

.. important:: For replica sets these restores reflect a single point
   in time, for sharded clusters, the Backup service provides a
   restore that will reflect *nearly* the same moment for each shard.
