=================================
Java Driver Replica Set Semantics
=================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

The MongoDB Java driver handles failover in replicated setups with
tuneable levels of transparency to the user. By default, a ``MongoClient``
connection object will ignore failures of secondaries, and reads
will only throw a ``MongoException`` when the primary node is unavailable.

The level of exception reporting is tuneable however, using a specific
``WriteConcern`` ; you can set this on the MongoClient/DB/DBCollection/Method
level. Several levels are included as static options:

.. list-table::

   * - .. option:: WriteConcern.UNACKNOWLEDGED

     - Exceptions are only thrown when the primary node is unreachable
       for a read, or the full replica set is unreachable.

   * - .. option:: WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED

     - Same as the above, but exceptions thrown when there is a server
       error on writes or reads. Calls ``getLastError()``.

   * - .. option:: WriteConcern.REPLICA_ACKNOWLEDGED

     - Tries to write to two separate nodes. Same as the above, but
       will throw an exception if two writes are not possible.

   * - .. option:: WriteConcern.JOURNALED

     - Same as :option:`WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED`, but also waits for write to be
       written to the journal.

.. warning::

   Additional errors may appear in the log files, these are for
   reporting purposes and logged based on the logging settings.

Sample code is provided which illustrates some of these options. To
quickly initialize a sample replica set, you can use the
:program:`manual:mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var rst = new ReplSetTest({ nodes : 3 })
   rst.startSet() // wait for processes to start
   rst.initiate() // wait for replica set initialization

Java client code demonstrating error handling is available:

Read Preferences and Tagging
----------------------------

MongoDB’s read preferences and tagging allows application developers to
target member nodes within a replica set for read or write operations.
Version 2.2 brings several refinements on node tagging that give you
greater control over how your data is read or written. Release 2.9.0 of
the Java driver has been built in coordination with the release of
MongoDB 2.2 and provides full access to these newly available
preferences and tagging features.

Read Preferences
----------------

A read preference provides client applications with control over which
nodes of a replica set are used for reads. A client application defines
its read preference by selecting one of the five behavioral modes:

- PRIMARY
     The default read mode. Read from primary only. Throw an error if
     primary is unavailable. Cannot be combined with tags.

- PRIMARY PREFERRED
     Read from primary if available, otherwise a secondary.

- SECONDARY
     Read from a secondary node if available, otherwise error.

- SECONDARY PREFERRED
     Read from a secondary if available, otherwise read from the primary.

- NEAREST
     Read from any member node from the set of nodes which respond the
     fastest. The responsiveness of a node is measured with pings. Any
     node whose ping time is within 15 milliseconds of the node with
     the lowest ping time is considered near.

Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Java driver implements MongoDB’s read preferences with the
``ReadPreference`` class. Client applications allocate the desired read
mode by calling one of ``ReadPreference``'s static factory methods. One
factory method exists for each mode.

.. code-block:: java

   ReadPreference.primary();
   ReadPreference.primaryPreferred();
   ReadPreference.secondary();
   ReadPreference.secondaryPreferred();
   ReadPreference.nearest();

The factory method returns a private inner subclass of ``ReadPreference``
that implements the correct behavioral mode. The driver’s use of
polymorphism in this manner means that your code only needs to
interface with the ``ReadPreference`` class alone.

Example
~~~~~~~

Suppose we are developing an application and we prefer operate on
strongly consistent data, (i.e. read requests always return the most
recent updates of a given document). In this case, the primary node
will handle all reads and writes. Now suppose our application must be
able to perform reads even if the primary becomes unavailable for some
reason. Even though we prefer data consistency we can tolerate eventual
consistency when the primary is down. We therefore use the primary
preferred mode as our read preference.

.. code-block:: java

   ReadPreference preference = ReadPreference.primaryPreferred();
   DBCursor cur = new DBCursor(collection, query, null, preference);

The Java driver maintains knowledge and state of the replica set by
periodically pinging the member nodes and can detect the loss of a
member. In this example, the driver will automatically detect the loss
of the primary and route the read request to a secondary node, just as
we have instructed.

Tags
----

As of version 2.0 of MongoDB, each node within your replica set can be
marked with additional descriptors called tags. Tags can be used to
indicate a node’s location, membership in a designated set, or other
characteristics. Tags enable your application to read from or write to
specific nodes or a set of nodes in a replica set.

As an example, suppose we’re running a replica set of three nodes
deployed across three separate data centers. Each of these data centers
is in a separate geographic location. We want to ensure that our data
will persist in the event of a disaster, so we mark each node with a
tag indicating the region where it lives. Our replica set configuration
might look similar to this:

.. code-block:: javascript

   foo:SECONDARY> rs.conf()
   {
      "_id" : "foo",
      "version" : 103132,
      "members" : [
                     {
                        "_id" : 0,
                        "host" : "localhost:27017",
                        "priority" : 10,
                        "tags" : {
                                   "datacenter" : "Los Angeles",
                                   "region" : "US_West"
                        }
                     },
                     {
                        "_id" : 1,
                        "host" : "localhost:27018",
                        "tags" : {
                                   "datacenter" : "San Jose",
                                   "region" : "US_West"
                        }
                     },
                     {
                        "_id" : 2,
                        "host" : "localhost:27019",
                        "tags" : {
                                   "datacenter" : "Richmond",
                                   "region" : "US_East"
                        }
                     }
      ],
      "settings" : {
                     "getLastErrorModes" : {
                                             "DRSafe" : {
                                                          "region" : 2
                                             }
                     }
      }
   }
   foo:SECONDARY>

Notice the ``settings`` field in the replication configuration. We’ve
defined a new ``getLastErrorModes`` object with the key ``DRSafe``.
When our client application uses this error mode in a write concern it
is instructing the write operation to replicate to at least two regions
before completion. Here’s an example in the Java driver:

.. code-block:: java

   // create a write concern with the specific getLastErrorMode
   WriteConcern concern = new WriteConcern("DRSafe");
        
   // an insert with the custom write concern
   coll.insert(new BasicDBObject("name", "simple doc"), concern);

By allocating a write concern using the ``"DRSafe"`` error mode and passing
it in on the insert, we have now ensured that our data has been backed
up to two separate regions and will be available should a data center
fail.

Using Tags with Read Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Continuing with our sample application, we decide that we want to send
our read requests to the nearest node to reduce request latency. The
Java driver’s read preference API gives a couple of ways of doing this,
the easiest is to simply use the nearest mode.

.. code-block:: java

   DBObject query = new BasicDBObject("name", "simple doc")
   DBObject result =
       coll.findOne(query, null, ReadPreference.nearest());

By using the nearest mode the driver will automatically send the read
to one of a set of nodes with the lowest ping time relative to the
client application, (the receiving node could be either a primary or
secondary). But suppose our client application can determine where its
requests originate. We could have explicitly tagged the read preference
to use the datacenter nearest to our location.

Look again at the replica set configuration from above. Each node has
been tagged by data center. Let’s say that the current read request is
coming from southern California. We can configure this read request to
be served by the node living in our Los Angeles data center.

.. code-block:: java

   // initialize a properly tagged read preference
   ReadPreference tagged_pref =
       ReadPreference.secondaryPreferred(new BasicDBObject("datacenter", "Los Angeles"));

   // include the tagged read preference in this request}}
   DBObject result = coll.findOne(}}
       new BasicDBObject("name", "simple doc"), null, tagged_pref);

Read preferences can also accept multiple tags. Returning to our
example application, suppose we want to send our reads either the
``"Los Angeles"`` node, or failing to find a healthy member in Los
Angeles a node in the ``"US_West"`` region:

.. code-block:: java

   // read from either LA or US_West
   DBObject tagSetOne = new BasicDBObject("datacenter", "Los Angeles"):
   DBObject tagSetTwo = new BasicDBObject("region", "US_West");

   ReadPreference pref =
       ReadPreference.primaryPreferred(tagSetOne, tagSetTwo);

In this example, the driver looks first for a member tagged with
datacenter ``"Los Angeles"``. If it cannot find an available member,
the driver will it look for a member tagged with region of
``"US_West"``. You may use a tag set to define a set of required tags a
member node must have to be used for the read. For example:

.. code-block:: java

   // read from either LA or US_West
   DBObject tagSetOne = new BasicDBObject("datacenter", "Los Angeles");
   tagSetOne.put("rack", "1");
   DBObject tagSetTwo = new BasicDBObject("region", "US_West");

   ReadPreference pref =
       ReadPreference.primaryPreferred(tagSetOne, tagSetTwo);

The difference being the driver is looking for a node that is tagged
with both data center ``"Los Angeles"`` and on rack ``1``, or a node
that is in region ``"US_West"``.

You can set the Read Preference at the operation, collection, ``DB``,
``Mongo``, ``MongoOptions``, or ``MongoURI`` level, and the preference
will be inherited similar to the way ``slaveOk`` and write concern are.
Read preferences work with any server version that supports replica
sets (1.6 and up). Tagged read preferences work with any version that
supports tagging (2.0 and up). However, tagging will only work on a
sharded cluster if you are connecting to a :program:`manual:mongos` running
2.2 or above.
