  The following query searches for the word ``baseball`` in
  the ``plot`` field. It includes a :manual:`$limit
  </reference/operator/aggregation/limit>` stage to limit the 
  output to 5 results and a :manual:`$project
  </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` stage to exclude all
  fields except ``title`` and ``plot``.

  To run this simple |fts| query in |compass|:

  a. Click the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Select...`, then configure each of the following 
     pipeline stages by selecting the stage from the dropdown and adding
     the query for that stage. Click :guilabel:`Add Stage` to add 
     additional stages.

  ``$search`` has several :ref:`operators <fts-operators>` for
  constructing different types of queries. The following query

  several operators into a single query. It has the following 
  search criteria:

  - The ``plot`` field must contain either ``Hawaii`` or 
    ``Alaska``.
  - The ``plot`` field must contain a four-digit number, such as a
    year.
  - The ``genres`` field must not contain either ``Comedy`` or
    ``Romance``.
  - The ``title`` field must not contain ``Beach`` or ``Snow``.
