  The :guilabel:`Users` tab also lists any outstanding invitations to
  users to join the project and any requests from users who want to join
  the project. A user can request to join a project when they first
  register for |mms|.

  Individual users are ordered by status. They appear in the following
  sequence:

  a. Users currently in your project.
  #. Users with pending invitations to join your project.
  #. Users requesting to join your project.

  |mms| displays the :guilabel:`Name` of users who have not accepted
  their invitation as :guilabel:`Pending User` and their role as
  :guilabel:`--invite sent--`.
