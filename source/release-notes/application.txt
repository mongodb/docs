-----------------------

*Released 2014-05-29*

- Critical bug fix for backing up MongoDB 2.6 deployments that include user or custom role definitions.
  The system.version collection in the admin database will be included in all future snapshots.
  The system.roles collection in the admin database will be included after a new initial sync is
  performed.  We strongly recommend that customers using MMS Backup to back up MongoDB 2.6 replica sets
  or clusters that include custom role definitions perform a new initial sync to ensure that the role
  definitions are included in the backup.
