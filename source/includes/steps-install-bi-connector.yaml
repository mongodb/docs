title: Generate your schema definition file.
ref: generate-schema
level: 4
pre: |
  Provide a MongoDB server hostname, replace ``dbname`` with the name of your
  database, and optionally replace ``collname`` with the name of a collection.
  If you do not specify a collection, :program:`mongodrdl` will generate a
  schema from all collections in ``dbname``.
action:
  - heading: "Linux / macOS"
    language: sh
    copyable: true
    code: |
      mongodrdl --host {your.mongohost.com} -d dbname [-c collname] -o schema.drdl
  - heading: "Windows"
    language: powershell
    copyable: true
    code: |
      "C:\Program Files\MongoDB BI Connector\bin\mongodrdl.exe" --host {your.mongohost.com} -d dbname [-c collname] -o schema.drdl
post: |
  .. note::
     The :option:`--host` option only accepts a hostname. You cannot
     provide a :ref:`MongoDB connection string <mongodb-uri>`.

  You can examine the generated ``schema.drdl`` file, and remove any fields or
  tables that are not part of your intended schema.
