Partial indexes only index the documents in a collection that meet a
specified filter expression. By indexing a subset of the documents in a
collection, partial indexes have lower storage requirements and reduced
performance costs for index creation and maintenance.

Create a Partial Index
----------------------

To create a ``partial`` index, use the
:method:`db.collection.createIndex()` method with the
``partialFilterExpression`` option. The ``partialFilterExpression``
option accepts a document that specifies the filter condition using:

.. include:: /includes/fact-partial-filter-expression-operators.rst

For example, the following operation creates a compound index that
indexes only the documents with a ``rating`` field greater than 5.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.createIndex(
      { cuisine: 1, name: 1 },
      { partialFilterExpression: { rating: { $gt: 5 } } }
   )

You can specify a ``partialFilterExpression`` option for all MongoDB
:ref:`index types <index-types>`.

Behavior
--------

.. _partial-index-query-coverage:

Query Coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB will not use the partial index for a query or sort operation if
using the index results in an incomplete result set.

To use the partial index, a query must contain the filter expression
(or a modified filter expression that specifies a subset of the filter
expression) as part of its query condition.

For example, given the following index:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.createIndex(
      { cuisine: 1 },
      { partialFilterExpression: { rating: { $gt: 5 } } }
   )

The following query can use the index since the query predicate
includes the condition ``rating: { $gte: 8 }`` that matches a subset of
documents matched by the index filter expression ``rating: { $gt: 5
}``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.find( { cuisine: "Italian", rating: { $gte: 8 } } )

However, the following query cannot use the partial index on the
``cuisine`` field because using the index results in an incomplete
result set. Specifically, the query predicate includes the condition
``rating: { $lt: 8 }`` while the index has the filter ``rating: { $gt:
5 }``. That is, the query ``{ cuisine: "Italian", rating: { $lt: 8 }
}`` matches more documents (e.g. an Italian restaurant with a rating
equal to 1) than are indexed.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.find( { cuisine: "Italian", rating: { $lt: 8 } } )

Similarly, the following query cannot use the partial index because the
query predicate does not include the filter expression and using the
index would return an incomplete result set.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.find( { cuisine: "Italian" } )

Comparison with the ``sparse`` Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip::
   Partial indexes represent a superset of the functionality offered by
   sparse indexes and should be preferred over sparse indexes.

Partial indexes offer a more expressive mechanism than
:doc:`/core/index-sparse` indexes to specify which documents are
indexed.

Sparse indexes select documents to index *solely* based on the
existence of the indexed field, or for compound indexes, the existence
of the indexed fields.

Partial indexes determine the index entries based on the specified
filter. The filter can include fields other than the index keys and
can specify conditions other than just an existence check. For example,
a partial index can implement the same behavior as a sparse index:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.contacts.createIndex(
      { name: 1 },
      { partialFilterExpression: { name: { $exists: true } } }
   )

This partial index supports the same queries as a sparse index on the
``name`` field.

However, a partial index can also specify filter expressions on fields
other than the index key. For example, the following operation creates
a partial index, where the index is on the ``name`` field but the
filter expression is on the ``email`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.contacts.createIndex(
      { name: 1 },
      { partialFilterExpression: { email: { $exists: true } } }
   )

For the query optimizer to choose this partial index, the query
predicate must include a condition on the ``name`` field as well
as a *non-null* match on the ``email`` field.

For example, the following query can use the index because it includes
both a condition on the ``name`` field and a non-null match on the
``email`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.contacts.find( { name: "xyz", email: { $regex: /\.org$/ } } )

However, the following query cannot use the index because it
includes a null match on the ``email`` field, which is not permitted
by the filter expression
``{ email: { $exists: true } }``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.contacts.find( { name: "xyz", email: { $exists: false } } )

Restrictions
------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-5.0-multiple-partial-index.rst

You cannot specify both the ``partialFilterExpression`` option and
the ``sparse`` option.

``_id`` indexes cannot be partial indexes.

Shard key indexes cannot be partial indexes.

Examples
--------

Create a Partial Index On A Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider a collection ``restaurants`` containing documents that resemble
the following

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("5641f6a7522545bc535b5dc9"),
      "address" : {
         "building" : "1007",
         "coord" : [
            -73.856077,
            40.848447
         ],
         "street" : "Morris Park Ave",
         "zipcode" : "10462"
      },
      "borough" : "Bronx",
      "cuisine" : "Bakery",
      "rating" : { "date" : ISODate("2014-03-03T00:00:00Z"),
                   "grade" : "A",
                   "score" : 2
                 },
      "name" : "Morris Park Bake Shop",
      "restaurant_id" : "30075445"
   }

You could add a partial index on the ``borough`` and ``cuisine`` fields
choosing only to index documents where the ``rating.grade``
field is ``A``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.createIndex(
      { borough: 1, cuisine: 1 },
      { partialFilterExpression: { 'rating.grade': { $eq: "A" } } }
   )

Then, the following query on the ``restaurants`` collection uses the partial index
to return the restaurants in the Bronx with ``rating.grade`` equal to ``A``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.find( { borough: "Bronx", 'rating.grade': "A" } )

However, the following query cannot use the partial index because the
query expression does not include the ``rating.grade`` field:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.restaurants.find( { borough: "Bronx", cuisine: "Bakery" } )

.. _partial-index-with-unique-constraints:

Partial Index with Unique Constraint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Partial indexes only index the documents in a collection that meet a
specified filter expression. If you specify both the
``partialFilterExpression`` and a :ref:`unique constraint
<index-type-unique>`, the unique constraint only applies to the
documents that meet the filter expression. A partial index with a
unique constraint does not prevent the insertion of documents that do
not meet the unique constraint if the documents do not meet the filter
criteria.

For example, a collection ``users`` contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : ObjectId("56424f1efa0358a27fa1f99a"), "username" : "david", "age" : 29 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("56424f37fa0358a27fa1f99b"), "username" : "amanda", "age" : 35 }
   { "_id" : ObjectId("56424fe2fa0358a27fa1f99c"), "username" : "rajiv", "age" : 57 }

The following operation creates an index that specifies a :ref:`unique
constraint <index-type-unique>` on the ``username`` field and a partial
filter expression ``age: { $gte: 21 }``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.createIndex(
      { username: 1 },
      { unique: true, partialFilterExpression: { age: { $gte: 21 } } }
   )

The index prevents the insertion of the following documents since
documents already exist with the specified usernames and the ``age``
fields are greater than ``21``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.insertMany( [
      { username: "david", age: 27 },
      { username: "amanda", age: 25 },
      { username: "rajiv", age: 32 }
   ] )

However, the following documents with duplicate usernames are allowed
since the unique constraint only applies to documents with ``age``
greater than or equal to 21.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.insertMany( [
      { username: "david", age: 20 },
      { username: "amanda" },
      { username: "rajiv", age: null }
   ] )
