Why Am I Getting Errors While Connecting to MongoDB?
----------------------------------------------------

If you have trouble connecting to a MongoDB deployment, see
the :ref:`Connection Troubleshooting Guide <csharp-connection-troubleshooting>`
for possible solutions.

.. _csharp-faq-connection-pool:

How Does Connection Pooling Work in the {+driver-short+}?
---------------------------------------------------------

Every ``MongoClient`` instance has a built-in connection pool for each server
in your MongoDB topology. Connection pools open sockets on demand to
support concurrent MongoDB operations in your multi-threaded application.

The maximum size of each connection pool is set by the ``MaxConnectionPoolSize`` option, which
defaults to ``100``. If the number of in-use connections to a server reaches
the value of ``MaxConnectionPoolSize``, the next request to that server will wait
until a connection becomes available. The following diagram illustrates a high-level view
of how the ``MongoClient`` manages a connection pool:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/CMAP_diagram.svg
   :alt: CMAP diagram

In addition to the sockets needed to support your application's threads,
each ``MongoClient`` instance opens two additional sockets per server
in your MongoDB topology for monitoring the server's state.
For example, a client connected to a three-node replica set opens six
monitoring sockets. If the application uses the default setting for
``MaxConnectionPoolSize`` and only queries the primary (default) node, then
there can be at most ``106`` total connections in use. If the
application uses a :ref:`read preference <read-preference>` to query the
secondary nodes, those connection pools grow and there can be
``306`` total connections.

To support high numbers of concurrent MongoDB threads
within one process, you can increase ``MaxConnectionPoolSize``.

The driver has a wait queue that limits the number of threads that can
wait for a connection. The size of the wait queue is determined by the
``WaitQueueMultiple`` option, which defaults to ``5``. To calculate the
maximum wait queue size, the driver multiplies ``WaitQueueMultiple`` by
``MaxConnectionPoolSize``. If you use the default value for each option,
the wait queue size will be ``500``. You can also set the wait queue
size by specifying the ``WaitQueueSize`` option, which overrides the
other settings. However, we do not recommend changing the wait queue
size from the default.

Connection pools are rate-limited. The ``MaxConnecting`` setting
determines the number of connections that the pool can create in
parallel at any time. For example, if the value of ``MaxConnecting`` is
``2``, the third thread that attempts to concurrently check out a
connection succeeds only in one of the following cases:

- One of the first two threads finishes creating a connection.
- An existing connection is checked back into the pool.
- The driver's ability to reuse existing connections improves due to
  rate-limits on connection creation.

You can set the minimum number of concurrent connections to
each server by using the ``MinConnectionPoolSize`` option, which
defaults to ``0``. The connection pool will be initialized with this
number of sockets. If errors cause any sockets to close and the
total number of sockets (both in-use and idle) drops below the minimum,
the driver opens more sockets until the number reaches the minimum.

You can set the maximum number of milliseconds that a connection can
remain idle in the pool by using the ``MaxConnectionIdleTime`` option.
Once a connection is idle for ``MaxConnectionIdleTime``, the driver
removes it. This option defaults to 10 minutes. If the pool size falls
below ``MinConnectionPoolSize``, the driver removes *and* replaces the
idle connection.

``MongoClient`` also has the ``MaxConnectionLifeTime`` option, which
specifies the length of time, 30 minutes by default, that a connection
can be pooled before expiring.

The following default configuration for a ``MongoClient`` works for most
applications:

.. code-block:: csharp
   
   var client = new MongoClient("<connection string>");

Create a client once for each process, and reuse it for all
operations. It is a common mistake to create a new client for each
request, which is very inefficient.

There is no supported way to terminate a ``MongoClient`` in the driver.

Why Does the Driver Throw a Timeout During Server Selection?
------------------------------------------------------------

Each driver operation requires that you choose a healthy server
satisfying the :manual:`server selection criteria
</core/read-preference-mechanics>`. If you do not select an appropriate
server within the `server selection timeout <{+new-api-root+}/MongoDB.Driver.Legacy/MongoDB.Driver.MongoServerSettings.ServerSelectionTimeout.html>`__, the driver throws a
server selection timeout exception. The exception looks similar to the
following:

.. code-block:: none

   A timeout occurred after 30000ms selecting a server using CompositeServerSelector{ Selectors = MongoDB.Driver.MongoClient+AreSessionsSupportedServerSelector, LatencyLimitingServerSelector{ AllowedLatencyRange = 00:00:00.0150000 }, OperationsCountServerSelector }.
   Client view of cluster state is 
   { 
       ClusterId : "1", 
       Type : "Unknown", 
       State : "Disconnected", 
       Servers : 
       [{
           ServerId: "{ ClusterId : 1, EndPoint : "Unspecified/localhost:27017" }",
           EndPoint: "Unspecified/localhost:27017",
           ReasonChanged: "Heartbeat",
           State: "Disconnected",
           ServerVersion: ,
           TopologyVersion: ,
           Type: "Unknown",
           HeartbeatException: "<exception details>"
       }] 
   }.

The error message consists of multiple parts:

1. The server selection timeout (30000 ms).
#. The server selectors considered (``CompositeServerSelector``
   containing ``AreSessionsSupportedServerSelector``,
   ``LatencyLimitingServerSelector``, and
   ``OperationsCountServerSelector``).
#. The driver’s current view of the cluster topology. The list of
   servers that the driver is aware of is a key part of this view. Each
   server description contains an exhaustive description of its current
   state including information about an endpoint, a server version, a
   server type, and its current health state. If the server encounters issues in
   reporting its health, ``HeartbeatException`` contains the exception from the
   last failed heartbeat. Analyzing the ``HeartbeatException`` on each
   cluster node can assist in diagnosing most server selection issues.
   The following heartbeat exceptions are common:
   
   * ``No connection could be made because the target machine actively
     refused it``: The driver cannot see this cluster node. This can be
     because the cluster node has crashed, a firewall is preventing
     network traffic from reaching the cluster node or port, or some other
     network error is preventing traffic from being successfully routed to
     the cluster node.
   * ``Attempted to read past the end of the stream``: This error
     happens when the driver cannot connect to the cluster nodes due to a
     network error, misconfigured firewall, or other network issue. To
     address this exception, ensure that all cluster nodes are reachable.
     This error commonly occurs when the client machine’s IP address is
     not configured in the Atlas IPs Access List, which can be found under
     the :guilabel:`Network Access` tab for your Atlas Project.
   * ``The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation
     procedure``: This error typically indicates a TLS/SSL-related problem
     such as an expired/invalid certificate or an untrusted root CA. You
     can use tools like ``openssl s_client`` to debug TLS/SSL-related
     certificate problems.

.. _csharp-faq-linq-vs-builder:

Should I Use LINQ, Builder Classes, or BSON Documents When Querying for Documents?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're used to programming in {+language+}, consider using LINQ because of its similar feel
to programming in native {+language+}. If you have prior experience with other MongoDB drivers,
consider using builder classes because of their consistency with other drivers. BSON
documents offer the most flexibility and can translate more easily to other programming
languages, but are less idiomatic to {+language+} and do not check for type errors at
compile time.

We encourage experimenting with each approach to determine the most suitable mechanism
for your purposes. To learn more about visualizing LINQ and builder class queries, see the
`{+analyzer+} <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-analyzer/current/>`__. For assistance
in building BSON document queries, see the :compass:`MongoDB Compass <>` documentation.

.. _csharp-faq-unsupported-expressions:

Why are Certain LINQ or Builder Expressions Unsupported?
--------------------------------------------------------

Each LINQ or Builder expression must be available in the Query API. This is not
always possible for the following reasons:

1. You are attempting to use a {+lang-framework+} feature that does not have an
   equivalent MongoDB representation. For example, {+lang-framework+} and MongoDB have
   different semantics around collations.
#. The driver does not support a particular transformation from LINQ or
   Builder expression into MQL (MongoDB Query Language). This may happen because the
   provided query has no MQL translation or because a feature has not been
   implemented yet in the driver.

If you receive an ``Unsupported filter ...`` or ``Expression not
supported ...`` exception message, try the following
steps:

1. Try configuring the new `LINQ3
   <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.17/reference/driver/crud/linq3/>`__
   provider. The LINQ3 provider contains many fixes and new features
   over the LINQ2 provider.
#. Use the `{+analyzer+}
   <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-analyzer/current/>`__ to analyze your
   expressions.
#. Try to simplify your query where possible.
#. Provide a query as a ``BsonDocument`` or JSON string. All driver
   definition classes such as ``FilterDefinition``,
   ``ProjectionDefinition``, and ``PipelineDefinition`` support implicit
   conversion from ``BsonDocument`` or JSON string. For example, the
   following filters are equivalent when used in a query or
   aggregation:

.. code-block:: csharp

   FilterDefinition<Entity> typedFilter = Builders<Entity>.Filter.Eq(e => e.A, 1);
   FilterDefinition<Entity> bsonFilter = new BsonDocument {{ "a", 1 }};
   FilterDefinition<Entity> jsonFilter = "{ a : 1 }";

.. note::

   If you use ``BsonDocument`` or JSON string, then `BsonClassMap
   <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-csharp-driver/2.17/reference/bson/mapping/>`__,
   BSON serialization attributes, and serialization conventions are not
   taken into account in the Query API. Field names must match the
   names and casing as stored by the server. For example, when referencing
   the ``_id`` field, you must refer to it using ``_id`` in
   ``BsonDocument`` or JSON string definitions. Similarly, if a document
   has a field ``FirstName`` annotated with ``[BsonElement("first_name")]``, you
   must refer to it as ``first_name`` in ``BsonDocument`` or JSON string
   definitions.
   
You can combine the raw and typed forms in the same query, as the
following code demonstrates:

.. code-block:: csharp

   FilterDefinition<Entity> filter = Builders<Entity>.Filter
       .And(Builders<Entity>.Filter
           .Eq(e => e.A, 1), BsonDocument
           .Parse("{ b : 2 }"));

.. _csharp-faq-object-serializer:

What Object Types Can Be Serialized?
------------------------------------

The ``ObjectSerializer`` allows serialization and deserialization only of types
that are considered safe. When you construct an ``ObjectSerializer``,
you can pass in a delegate of type ``Func<Type, bool>``. This delegate
accepts an object type and returns a boolean value indicating whether the
type is safe for serialization.

In most cases, you should pass in the ``ObjectSerializer.DefaultAllowedTypes()``
delegate. This method returns true for a number of well-known
framework types that we have deemed safe. To serialize custom types,
create a boolean expression that evaluates to ``true`` for the
types you want to include. Then, add this expression to the end of the 
delegate you pass to the ``ObjectSerializer`` constructor.

In the following example,
the ``ObjectSerializer`` will serialize and deserialize any type that is allowed by 
``ObjectSerializer.DefaultAllowedTypes()`` or whose full name begins with 
``"MyNamespace"``:

.. code-block:: csharp

   var objectSerializer = new ObjectSerializer(type => ObjectSerializer.DefaultAllowedTypes(type)
       || type.FullName.StartsWith("MyNamespace"));
   BsonSerializer.RegisterSerializer(objectSerializer);

To allow anonymous types to be serialized, add the boolean expression
``type.FullName.StartsWith("<>f__AnonymousType"))`` to your delegate,
as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: csharp

   var objectSerializer = new ObjectSerializer(type => ObjectSerializer.DefaultAllowedTypes(type)
       || type.FullName.StartsWith("<>f__AnonymousType"));
   BsonSerializer.RegisterSerializer(objectSerializer);

You should create and register your ``ObjectSerializer`` at the start of your program,
before doing anything else.

What is the Difference Between the {+driver-short+} and the {+ef-provider-long+}?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The {+driver-short+} is a library that exposes MongoDB functionality
directly and includes a LINQ provider with projections, group
operations, and flexible mapping. The driver includes features such as the
following:

- Transactions
- Bulk operations
- LINQ queries
- Operations that directly modify the database
- Aggregation operations
- Custom mapping

The `{+ef-provider-short+} <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/entity-framework/current/>`__ 
allows you to use Microsoft's Entity Framework Core with
MongoDB in your {+lang-framework+} applications. The {+ef-provider-short+} supports
change tracking, entity-based LINQ operations, and modeling familiar to
Entity Framework Core users. The provider includes features such as the following:

- Intelligent object tracking
- Entity-based LINQ operations
- Entity Framework modeling and mapping with the fluent API
- Automatic database updates through change tracking
