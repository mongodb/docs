This guide shows you how to create an application that uses the
**Node.js driver** to connect to a **MongoDB Atlas cluster**. If you
prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different driver or programming
language, see our :driver:`list of official drivers <>`.

The Node.js driver is an interface through which you can connect to and
communicate with MongoDB instances.

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database service that hosts your data
on MongoDB instances. We show you how to get started with your own free (no
credit card required) instance in this guide.

Follow the steps below to connect your Node.js application with a MongoDB
instance.

Set up Your Project
-------------------

Install Node and NPM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure your system has Node.js version 10 or later and a compatible
version of NPM (Node Package Manager) installed. For more information on how
to check your version of Node and NPM and installation instructions for your
system, see `downloading and installing Node.js and npm
<https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm>`_.

Initialize the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you verify that you installed the required versions of Node and NPM,
create a new project.

First, create a directory for your project in your command line interface:

.. code-block:: none

   mkdir node_quickstart

Then, navigate into that directory so you can work directly with your
project's files:

.. code-block:: none

  cd node_quickstart

Next, set up NPM for your project by running the following command.
This command creates a file called ``package.json``:

.. code-block:: none

  npm init -y

.. note:: Why the -y?

  If you specify the ``-y`` option in the command, NPM automatically
  accepts the default values for the command. Omit the ``-y`` flag to
  interactively select your project settings.

Add MongoDB as a Dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, add the official Node.js MongoDB driver to your project dependencies.
Use the following command to instruct NPM to download and install the
``mongodb`` package.

.. code-block:: none

  npm install mongodb

This command downloads ``mongodb`` package and dependencies required for its
installation and saves them into a directory called ``node_modules`` in
your project directory, and records the dependency information in the
``package.json`` file you generated in the previous step.

At this point, you should have appropriate versions of Node.js and NPM
installed as well as a project directory that contains the dependencies you
need to use the Node.js MongoDB driver.

Create a MongoDB Cluster
------------------------

Set up a Free Tier Cluster in Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After installing the Node MongoDB driver, create a MongoDB instance to store
and manage your data. Complete the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started?tck=docs_driver_nodejs>` guide
to set up a new Atlas account, free tier cluster (MongoDB instance), load
datasets, and interact with the data.

After completing the steps in the Atlas guide, you should have a new MongoDB
cluster deployed in Atlas, a new database user, and sample datasets loaded
into your cluster.

Connect to your Cluster
-----------------------

In this step, we create and run an application that uses the Node.js MongoDB
driver to connect to your instance of MongoDB and run a query on the sample
data.

We pass instructions to the driver on where and how to connect to your
MongoDB instance in a string called the *connection string*. This string
includes information on the hostname or IP address and port of your
instance, authentication mechanism, user credentials when applicable, and
other connection options.

To retrieve your connection string for the instance and user you created in
the previous step, log into your Atlas account and navigate to the
**Clusters** section and click the **Connect** button for the cluster that you
want to connect to as shown below.

   :alt: The connect button in the clusters section of the Atlas UI

Proceed to the **Connect Your Application** step and select the Node.js
driver. Select the "Connection String Only" tab and click the **Copy**
button to copy the *connection string* to your clipboard as shown below.

.. figure:: /includes/figures/atlas_connection_copy_string.png
   :alt: The connection string copy button in the Connection String Only tab of the Atlas UI

Save your connection string to a safe location that you can access in the
next step.

Next, create a file to contain your application called ``index.js`` in your
``node_quickstart`` directory. Add the following code, replacing the ``uri``
variable with your connection string. Make sure to replace the "<password>"
section of the connection string with the password you created for your user
that has **atlasAdmin** permissions.

.. code-block:: js

  const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");

  // Replace the uri string with your MongoDB deployment's connection string.
  const uri =
    "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>?retryWrites=true&writeConcern=majority";

  const client = new MongoClient(uri);

  async function run() {
    try {
      await client.connect();

      const database = client.db('sample_mflix');
      const collection = database.collection('movies');

      // Query for a movie that has the title 'Back to the Future'
      const query = { title: 'Back to the Future' };
      const movie = await collection.findOne(query);

      console.log(movie);
    } finally {
      // Ensures that the client will close when you finish/error
      await client.close();
    }
  }
  run().catch(console.dir);

Run the sample code with the following command from your command line:

.. code-block:: none

  node index.js

When you run the command, the sample code should output the details of the
movie which resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none

   {
     _id: ...,
     plot: 'A young man is accidentally sent 30 years into the past...',
     genres: [ 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi' ],
     ...
     title: 'Back to the Future',
     ...
   }

If or receive an error, check whether you included the proper connection
string in the application code, and loaded the sample dataset in your Atlas
cluster.

After completing this step, you should have a working application that uses
the Node.js driver to connect to your MongoDB instance, run a query on the
sample data, and prints out the result.
