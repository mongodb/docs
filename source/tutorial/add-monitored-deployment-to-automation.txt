=====================================
Add Monitored Processes to Automation
=====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

|mms| Automation lets you deploy, reconfigure, and upgrade your MongoDB
databases directly from the |mms| console.

If |mms| is already monitoring your MongoDB processes, you can add them to
Automation using this procedure.
If |mms| is not monitoring your MongoDB processes, see instead
:doc:`/tutorial/add-existing-mongodb-processes`, which adds the processes
to both Automation and Monitoring.

Automation relies on the Automation Agent, which you install on each
server that hosts a process to be added to automated management. The
Automation Agents regularly poll |mms| to determine goal configuration and
deploy changes as needed.

Considerations
--------------

Automation Agents can run only on 64-bit architectures.

Automation supports most but not all available MongoDB options. Automation
supports the options described in
:doc:`/reference/cluster-configuration-process-options`.

If the MongoDB process or the |mms| group requires authentication, the
addition of the MongoDB process to automation can update the security
settings.  See :ref:`automation-updated-security-settings`.

Prerequisites
-------------

|mms| is Monitoring the Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|mms| must be currently monitoring the MongoDB processes, and the
Monitoring Agent must be running. The processes must appear in the |mms|
:guilabel:`Deployment` tab.

The Automation Agent must have:

- Permission to stop the MongoDB processes. The Automation Agent will
  restart the processes using the agent's own set of MongoDB binaries. If
  you had installed MongoDB with a package manager, use the same package
  manager to install the Automation Agent. This gives the agent the same
  owner as MongoDB.

- ``Read`` and ``Write`` permissions on the MongoDB data directories and
  log directories.
