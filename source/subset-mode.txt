Subset Mode

You can enable :guilabel:`Subset Mode` in MongoDB Charts to restrict 
the input collection to ``1000`` randomly selected documents. To toggle
:guilabel:`Subset Mode`, use the toggle in the :guilabel:`Preview` 
section. The :guilabel:`Subset Mode` setting for a chart doesn't 
persist when the chart renders on a dashboard. So, if you enable 
subset mode when you build a chart, the data that renders in the 
dashboard isn't sampled.

.. note::

   When you enable subset mode and you specify a :ref:`filter 
   <charts-filter-documents>`, |charts| takes the sample of ``1000``
   documents *before* it applies the filter. So, |charts| might use 
   fewer than ``1000`` documents to plot the chart.

Use Case
--------

Consider using :guilabel:`Subset Mode` when you draft a chart and 
heavily modify chart options. In this situation, 
:guilabel:`Subset Mode` lets the chart render quickly 
during the building process. When you feel satisfied with your chart, 
save it as soon as possible.

.. note::

   Due to the random nature of sampling, when you have 
   :guilabel:`Subset Mode` enabled, your visualizations might change 
   each time the chart loads in the chart builder.
