Unlike Topologies

{+c2c-product-name+} 1.1 supports sync between clusters with different
sharding configurations.

You can sync:

- Between two sharded clusters
- Between two sharded clusters with a different number of shards in each
  cluster
- From a replica set to a sharded cluster

You cannot sync from a sharded cluster to a replica set. 

For more information, see: :ref:`c2c-api-start-sharding`.

Minimum Supported Server Version
--------------------------------

{+c2c-product-name+} requires at least MongoDB server version 6.0.4 on
both the source and target clusters.
