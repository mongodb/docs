msgid "You may not create compound indexes that have ``hashed`` index fields or specify a unique constraint on a ``hashed`` index; however, you can create both a ``hashed`` index and an ascending/descending (i.e. non-hashed) index on the same field: MongoDB will use the scalar index for range queries."

msgid "MongoDB ``hashed`` indexes truncate floating point numbers to 64-bit integers before hashing. For example, a ``hashed`` index would store the same value for a field that held a value of ``2.3``, ``2.2``, and ``2.9``. To prevent collisions, do not use a ``hashed`` index for floating point numbers that cannot be reliably converted to 64-bit integers (and then back to floating point). MongoDB ``hashed`` indexes do not support floating point values larger than 2\\ :sup:`53`."
