Starting in MongoDB 3.2, the WiredTiger storage engine is the default
storage engine. For existing deployments, if you do not specify the
``--storageEngine`` or the :setting:`storage.engine` setting, the
version 3.2+ :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance can automatically determine
the storage engine used to create the data files in the ``--dbpath`` or
:setting:`storage.dbPath`. See :ref:`3.2-storage-engine-compatibility`.

Document Level Concurrency
--------------------------

WiredTiger uses *document-level* concurrency control for write
operations. As a result, multiple clients can modify different
documents of a collection at the same time.

Snapshots and Checkpoints
-------------------------

WiredTiger uses MultiVersion Concurrency Control (MVCC). At the start
of an operation, WiredTiger provides a point-in-time snapshot of the
data to the transaction. A snapshot presents a consistent view of the
in-memory data.

When writing to disk, WiredTiger writes all the data in a snapshot to
disk in a consistent way across all data files. The now-:term:`durable`
data act as a *checkpoint* in the data files. The *checkpoint* ensures
that the data files are consistent up to and including the last
checkpoint; i.e. checkpoints can act as recovery points.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/wt-snapshot-frequency.rst

During the write of a new checkpoint, the previous checkpoint is still
valid. As such, even if MongoDB terminates or encounters an error while
writing a new checkpoint, upon restart, MongoDB can recover from the
last valid checkpoint.

The new checkpoint becomes accessible and permanent when WiredTiger's
metadata table is atomically updated to reference the new checkpoint.
Once the new checkpoint is accessible, WiredTiger frees pages from the
old checkpoints.

Using WiredTiger, even without :ref:`journaling
<storage-wiredtiger-journal>`, MongoDB can recover from the last
checkpoint; however, to recover changes made after the last checkpoint,
run with :ref:`journaling <storage-wiredtiger-journal>`.

.. _storage-wiredtiger-journal:

Journal
-------

WiredTiger uses a write-ahead transaction log in combination with
:ref:`checkpoints <storage-wiredtiger-checkpoints>` to ensure data
durability. 

The WiredTiger journal persists all data modifications between
checkpoints. If MongoDB exits between checkpoints, it uses the journal
to replay all data modified since the last checkpoint. For information
on the frequency with which MongoDB writes the journal data to disk,
see :ref:`journal-process`.

WiredTiger journal is compressed using the :term:`snappy` compression
library. To specify an alternate compression algorithm or no
compression, use the
:setting:`storage.wiredTiger.engineConfig.journalCompressor` setting.

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-wiredtiger-log-compression-limit.rst

You can disable journaling by setting :setting:`storage.journal.enabled`
to ``false``, which can reduce the overhead of maintaining the
journal. 

For :term:`standalone` instances, not using the journal means that,
when MongoDB exits unexpectedly, you will lose all data modifications
prior to the last checkpoint. For members of :term:`replica sets
<replica set>`, the replication process may provide sufficient
durability guarantees.

.. _storage-wiredtiger-compression:

Compression
-----------

With WiredTiger, MongoDB supports compression for all collections and
indexes. Compression minimizes storage use at the expense of additional
CPU.

By default, WiredTiger uses block compression with the :term:`snappy`
compression library for all collections and :term:`prefix compression`
for all indexes.

For collections, block compression with :term:`zlib` is also available.
To specify an alternate compression algorithm or no compression, use
the :setting:`storage.wiredTiger.collectionConfig.blockCompressor`
setting.

For indexes, to disable :term:`prefix compression`, use the
:setting:`storage.wiredTiger.indexConfig.prefixCompression` setting.

Compression settings are also configurable on a per-collection and
per-index basis during collection and index creation. See
:ref:`create-collection-storage-engine-options` and
:ref:`db.collection.createIndex() storageEngine option
<createIndex-options>`.

For most workloads, the default compression settings balance storage
efficiency and processing requirements.

The WiredTiger journal is also compressed by default. For information
on journal compression, see :ref:`storage-wiredtiger-journal`.
