Create a data model that uses :ref:`embedded
<data-modeling-embedding>` documents to describe a one-to-many
relationship between connected data. Embedding connected data
in a single document can reduce the number of read operations required
to obtain data. In general, structure your schema so your application receives 
all of its required information in a single read operation. For example, you 
can use the the embedded one-to-many model to describe the following relationships:

- Country to major cities
- Author to books
- Student to classes 

Example
-------

The example schema contains three entities, with ``address one`` and ``address two`` 
belonging to the same ``patron``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // patron document
   {
      _id: "joe",
      name: "Joe Bookreader"
   }

   // address one
   {
      street: "123 Fake Street",
      city: "Faketon",
      state: "MA",
      zip: "12345"
   }

   // address two
   {
      street: "1 Some Other Street",
      city: "Boston",
      state: "MA",
      zip: "12345"
   }

Embedded Document Pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example the application needs to display information for the ``patron`` 
and both ``address`` objects on a single page. To allow your application to 
retrieve all necessary information with a single query, embed the ``address one`` 
and ``address two`` information inside of the ``patron`` document: 

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id": "joe",
      "name": "Joe Bookreader",
      "addresses": [
         {
            "street": "123 Fake Street",
            "city": "Faketon",
            "state": "MA",
            "zip": "12345"
         },
         {
            "street": "1 Some Other Street",
            "city": "Boston",
            "state": "MA",
            "zip": "12345"
         }
      ]
    }
