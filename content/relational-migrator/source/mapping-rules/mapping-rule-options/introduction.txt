Mapping rule options are important options that help define the state
of your MongoDB collection after a migration.

These options are defined when creating or editing a 
:ref:`mapping rule <rm-mapping-rules>`.

Mapping Rule Concepts
---------------------

Every mapping rule joins a source table to a destination collection. 
You can create mapping rules from either a table or a collection.
When creating a mapping rule you must select the other entity. For example:

- If you select a table and choose to create a mapping rule you must choose the destination collection. 
- If you select a collection and choose to create a mapping rule, you must select the source table.

For :guilabel:`Embedded array` and :guilabel:`Embedded document` mapping rules, 
you must also configure where you want the embedded data inserted into your document. 

The table below provides a summary of the concepts associated with 
mapping rule options and the mapping rules they apply to.

   * - Concept
     - Description
     - Applies To
   * - Collection Name
     - The destination collection where the relational rows of data are migrated.
     - :guilabel:`New documents` 
   * - Parent collection
     - The destination collection where the relational rows of data are migrated.
     - :guilabel:`Embedded documents` :guilabel:`Embedded array` 
   * - Prefix
     - A drop-down where you can specify your rule hierarchy.
     - :guilabel:`Embedded documents` :guilabel:`Embedded array` 
   * - Field name
     - Indicates the field containing the array or document.
     - :guilabel:`Embedded documents` :guilabel:`Embedded array` 
   * - Create an array of primitive values
     - Creates a single field array in the parent collection.
     - :guilabel:`Embedded array` 
   * - Merge fields into the parent
     - Merges the table rows as fields at the parent collection level.
     - :guilabel:`Embedded documents` 
   * - :ref:`Mapping rule filter <rm-mapping-filters>`
     - Explicitly include rows where an expression returns true.
     - :guilabel:`New documents` :guilabel:`Embedded documents` :guilabel:`Embedded array`
   * - Array conditions
     - Sort, limit, and order an embedded array.
     - :guilabel:`Embedded array`

.. note::

   Relational Migratory primary key id field migration is defined at 
   the project level.

   For details on how these project setting affect your migration, 
   see :ref:`Key Handling Options <rm-key-handling-setting>`.

To conceptualize the examples of each mapping rule, the following 
``Mongo Enterprise`` relational schema is used to help explain each 
mapping rule option.
