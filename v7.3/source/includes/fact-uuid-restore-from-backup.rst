.. note ::

   All MongoDB collections have
   :abbr:`UUIDs (Universally unique identifiers)` by default. When
   MongoDB restores collections, the restored collections retain their
   original UUIDs. When restoring a collection where no UUID was
   present, MongoDB generates a UUID for the restored collection. 

   For more information on collection UUIDs, see
   `Collections <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v3.6/core/databases-and-collections/#collections>`_.
