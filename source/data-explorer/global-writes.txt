Administrators can shard collections residing in a 
|global-write-cluster| for 
:ref:`Global Writes <create-new-global-write-cluster>` using the 
:guilabel:`Data Explorer`.

Required Roles
--------------

You must have the :authrole:`Project Owner`  or :authrole:`Organization Owner`
role for the cluster's |service| project to shard a collection for 
|global-write| in the Data Explorer.

Considerations
--------------

Review the restrictions and compatibility requirements for
:ref:`global-writes-collections` before beginning this procedure.

After selecting a shard key via the
Data Explorer, |service| attempts to shard the target collection. 
During this period, make sure that no user manually
shards the collection. If |service| detects that the target 
collection was sharded with a different key than that selected via 
the Data Explorer, |service| stops the procedure and 
displays a warning for that collection in the Data Explorer. You can 
Click :guilabel:`Unmanage Collection` to clear the warning.
This removes the collection from |service| management while leaving
the underlying collection and the manually chosen shard key intact.

You cannot update the value of a shard key field in an existing document
in a |global-write|-enabled collection.

Procedure
---------

To shard a collection in a |global-write-cluster|:

|service| displays the compound shard key near the top of the
:guilabel:`Global Writes` tab after configuring the collection.
