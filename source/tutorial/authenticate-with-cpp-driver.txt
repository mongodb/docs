Authenticate to MongoDB using C++
=================================

This page is a brief overview of authenticating to a MongoDB cluster
with the 2.4 release of MongoDB and the C++ driver.

Normal Authentication
---------------------

To authenticate as the user "user1" with a password of "password1",
defined in the "test" database, begin by creating a connection:

.. code-block:: cpp

   // Create connection
   std::string errmsg;
   ConnectionString cs = ConnectionString::parse("localhost:27017", errmsg);
   if (!cs.isValid()) {
       cout << "error parsing url: " << errmsg << endl;
       return EXIT_FAILURE;
   }
   boost::scoped_ptr<DBClientBase> conn(cs.connect(errmsg));
   if (!conn) {
       cout << "couldn't connect: " << errmsg << endl;
       return EXIT_FAILURE;
   }


In some cases you may need to authenticate as multiple users in
different databases.  For example, imagine a map/reduce job that reads
from the database "first" and writes the results to the database
"second".  You may have to authenticate one user defined in the
"first" database and another in the "second":

.. code-block:: cpp

   // Authenticate
   conn->auth(BSON("user" << "user1" <<
                   "userSource" << "first" <<
                   "pwd" << "password1" <<
                   "mechanism" << "MONGODB-CR"));
   conn->auth(BSON("user" << "user2" <<
                   "userSource" << "second" <<
                   "pwd" << "password2" <<
                   "mechanism" << "MONGODB-CR"));

Kerberos Authentication
-----------------------

.. note::

   These features are only present in `MongoDB Enterprise
   <https://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise>`_.

   Additionally, to use Kerberos you must have ``libgsasl`` installed
   on your system *and* compile the C++ driver with the
   ``--use-sasl-client`` as in the following operation in the
   top-level of the MongoDB source tree:

   .. code-block:: sh

      scons --use-sasl-client libmongoclient.a

To authenticate to a MongoDB cluster using Kerberos, you must supply
the Kerberos user name and specify the Kerberos authentication
mechanism as in the following:

.. code-block:: cpp

   conn->auth(BSON("user" << "user@REALM.COM" <<
                   "userSource" << "$external" <<
                   "mechanism" << "GSSAPI"));
