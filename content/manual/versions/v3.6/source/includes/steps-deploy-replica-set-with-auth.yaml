   For each member in the replica set, start the :binary:`~bin.mongod` with
   either the :setting:`security.keyFile` configuration file setting or
   the ``--keyFile`` command-line option. Running :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   with the ``--keyFile`` command-line option or the
   :setting:`security.keyFile` configuration file setting enforces both
   :doc:`/core/security-internal-authentication` and
   :doc:`/core/authorization`.

action:
  - heading: Configuration File
    pre: |
      If using a configuration file, set

      - :setting:`security.keyFile` to the keyfile's path, and

      - :setting:`replication.replSetName` to the replica set name.

      - ``--keyFile`` set to  the keyfile's path, and

      - ``--replSet`` set to the replica set name.

title: Connect to a member of the replica set over the localhost interface.
level: 4
ref: deploy-repset-connect-to-member
pre: |
  Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to one of the 
  {{program}} instances over the :ref:`localhost
  interface<localhost-exception>`. You must run the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
  shell on the same physical machine as the {{program}} instance.

  The :ref:`localhost interface<localhost-exception>` is only available
  since no users have been created for the deployment. The
  :ref:`localhost interface<localhost-exception>` closes after the
  creation of the first user.

  program: :binary:`~bin.mongod`

      The following example initates a three member replica set.

    language: javascript
    code: |
      rs.initiate(
        {
          _id : <replicaSetName>,
          members: [

post: |
  :method:`rs.initiate()` triggers an :term:`election` and
  elects one of the members to be the :term:`primary`.

  Connect to the primary before continuing. Use :method:`rs.status()` to
  locate the primary member.

stepnum: 6
title: Create the user administrator.
level: 4
ref: deploy-repset-user-admin
pre: |
  .. important::
     After you create the first user, the :ref:`localhost exception
     <localhost-exception>` is no longer available.

     The first user must have privileges to create other users, such
     as a user with the :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase`. This ensures
     that you can create additional users after the :ref:`localhost-exception`
     closes.

     If at least one user does *not* have privileges to create users,
     once the localhost exception closes you may be unable to create
     or modify users with new privileges, and therefore unable to
     access necessary operations.

  Add a user using the :method:`db.createUser()` method. The user should
  have at minimum the :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role on the
  ``admin`` database.

  You must be connected to the :term:`primary` to create users.

  The following example creates the user ``fred`` with the
  :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role on the ``admin`` database.

  .. important::
     Passwords should be random, long, and complex to ensure system security
     and to prevent or delay malicious access.

action:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    admin = db.getSiblingDB("admin")
    admin.createUser(
      {
        user: "fred",
        pwd: "changeme1",
        roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]

title: Authenticate as the user administrator.
ref: deploy-repset-auth-user
level: 4
pre: |
  Authenticate to the ``admin`` database.
action:
  - pre: |
      In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, use :method:`db.auth()` to
      authenticate. For example, the following authenticate as the user
      administrator ``fred``:
    language: javascript
    code: |
      db.getSiblingDB("admin").auth("fred", "changeme1" )
  - pre: |
      Alternatively, connect a new :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary
      replica set member using the ``-u <username>``, ``-p <password>``, and
      the ``--authenticationDatabase`` parameters.
    language: sh
    code: |
      mongo -u "fred" -p "changeme1" --authenticationDatabase "admin"

title: Create the cluster administrator.

  operations, such as configuring the replica set.
action:
  - pre: |
      Create a cluster administrator user and assign the
      :authrole:`clusterAdmin` role in the ``admin`` database:

        {
          "user" : "ravi",
          "pwd" : "changeme2",

title: Create additional users (Optional).
ref: deploy-repset-add-addtl-users
level: 4
pre: |
  Create users to allow clients to connect and interact with the replica set.
  See :ref:`database-user-roles` for basic built-in roles to use in creating
  read-only and read-write users.

  You may also want additional administrative users.
