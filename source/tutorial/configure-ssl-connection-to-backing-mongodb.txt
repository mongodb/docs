==========================================================
Configure SSL Connections to the Backing MongoDB Instances
==========================================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

If you set up your :doc:`backing MongoDB instances
</tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>` to use access control,
then you must update |onprem|'s configuration files with the necessary
certificate information for accessing the MongoDB instances.

The ``conf-mms.properties`` file configures the connection to the |application| database
and, if you are using Backup, the Backup Database. 

If you are using Backup, you also need to update the ``conf-daemon.properties`` file
with the connection information for the |application| Database
and the SSL client certificates used to connect to the Backup database.

Prerequisites
-------------

This tutorial assumes that you have deployed the :ref:`mms-application-database`
and :ref:`mms-backup-blockstore-database`, and that you have configured them to 
use access control. For information on
deploying MongoDB with access control, see :manual:`Security Concepts
</core/security>` in the MongoDB manual.
