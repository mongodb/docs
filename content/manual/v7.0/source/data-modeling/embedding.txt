Embedded documents store related data in a single document structure. A
document can contain arrays and sub-documents with related data. These 
**denormalized** data models allow applications to retrieve related data
in a single database operation.

In the following example, the ``contact`` and ``access`` fields are embedded 
documents:

.. include:: /images/data-model-denormalized.rst

Embedded data models are often considered **denormalized** because
frequently-accessed data is duplicated in multiple collections.

Embedded data models let applications query related pieces of
information in the same database record. As a result, embedding provides the 
following benefits:

- Better performance for read operations

- The ability to retrieve related data in a single database operation

- The ability to update related data in a single atomic write
  operation

Embedded documents store related data in a single document structure. A
document can contain arrays and sub-documents with related data. These 
**denormalized** data models allow applications to retrieve related data
in a single database operation.

.. note:: Document Size Limit

   Documents in MongoDB must be smaller than 16 mebibytes.

   For large binary data, consider :ref:`GridFS <gridfs>`.

Use Cases
---------

Use embedded data models in the following scenarios:

- You have "contains" relationships between entities. For example, a
  ``contacts`` document that contains an ``address``. See
  :ref:`data-modeling-example-one-to-one`.

- You have one-to-many relationships between entities. In these
  relationships, the "many" or child documents are viewed in the context
  of the "one" or parent documents. See
  :ref:`data-modeling-example-one-to-many`.

Collections with a Large Number of Small Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a collection with a large number of small documents, consider 
embedding to improve performance. If you can group these small documents by some 
logical relationship *and* you frequently retrieve the documents by this 
grouping, you might consider "rolling-up" the small documents into larger 
documents that contain an array of embedded documents.

"Rolling up" these small documents into logical groupings means that
queries to retrieve a group of documents involve sequential reads and
fewer random disk accesses. Additionally, "rolling up" documents and
moving common fields to the larger document benefit the index on these
fields. There would be fewer copies of the common fields *and* there
would be fewer associated key entries in the corresponding index. See
:ref:`indexes` for more information on indexes.

However, if you often only need to retrieve a subset of the documents
within the group, then "rolling-up" the documents may not provide
better performance. Furthermore, if small, separate documents represent
the natural model for the data, you should maintain that model.

Query Embedded Data
-------------------

To query data within embedded documents, use :term:`dot notation`. For
examples of querying data in arrays and embedded documents, see:

- :ref:`read-operations-arrays`
