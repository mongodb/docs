  In the :guilabel:`New BI Connector` modal, configure the following
  settings:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 30 70

     * - :guilabel:`Choose Server`
       - Select the host where this new BI Connector is installed.

     * - :guilabel:`Deployment Item`
       - Select the deployment item (standalone, :term:`replica set`, 
         or :term:`sharded cluster`) to which this new BI connector 
         connects.

     * - :guilabel:`Port to Listen On`
       - Type the |iana| port number you want to use when connecting
         to this new BI Connector. The recommended port number is
         ``3306``.

     * - :guilabel:`Read Preference`
       - Select how the BI connector routes read operations to the 
         members of a :term:`replica set`. Available values include:

         - :readmode:`Primary <primary>`
         - :readmode:`Primary Preferred <primaryPreferred>`
         - :readmode:`Secondary Only <secondary>`
         - :readmode:`Secondary Preferred <secondaryPreferred>`
         - :readmode:`Nearest <nearest>`

     * - :guilabel:`Included Namespace(s)` *(Optional)* 
       - Type the name of a database and/or collection to limit what
         data the BI Connector can access.

         Leave this box blank to allow the BI Connector to use all 
         namespaces on the host.

         Click the :guilabel:`+ add another namespace` link to add 
         another namespace to your list of included namespaces.

  - heading: :guilabel:`SSL`

      If you need to use SSL to connect with the Deployment Item, 
      configure these settings:

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 30 70

         * - :guilabel:`SSL Mode`
           - Select :guilabel:`Disabled`, :guilabel:`Allow SSL`, or
             :guilabel:`Require SSL`. 

         * - :guilabel:`SSL PEM Key File Path`
           - Type the path on the MongoDB host where the SSL PEM key 
             file is stored.

         * - :guilabel:`SSL PEM Key Password` *(Optional)*
           - If you encrypted the PEM file, type its password.

  - heading: :guilabel:`Logs`
    pre: |

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 30 70

         * - :guilabel:`Linux Log File Path`
           - *(Conditional: BI Connector is installed on a Linux 
             platform)* Type the path to the BI Connector log on that 
             host.

         * - :guilabel:`Windows Log File Path`
           - *(Conditional: BI Connector is installed on a Windows
             platform)* Type the path to the BI Connector log
             on that host.

         * - :guilabel:`Log Rotation`
           - Toggle to ``ON`` to enable. Default is ``OFF``. 

             If toggled to ``ON``, the logs are rotated when the 
             :guilabel:`Size Threshold` or :guilabel:`Time Threshold` 
             is met.

             The next four settings require :guilabel:`Log Rotation` 
             to be set to ``ON``.

         * - :guilabel:`Size Threshold (MB)`

           - *(Conditional:* :guilabel:`Log Rotation` *=* ``ON`` *)* 
             Type the size the log file must reach in
             :abbr:`MB (Megabytes)` before the BI Connector rotates it
             automatically. The default value is
             ``1000.0`` (about 1 :abbr:`GB (Gigabyte)`).

         * - :guilabel:`Time Threshold (Hours)`
           - *(Conditional:* :guilabel:`Log Rotation` *=* ``ON`` *)*
             Type the duration the log file must cover in hours before 
             the BI Connector rotates it automatically. The default 
             value is ``24`` hours.

         * - :guilabel:`Max Uncompressed Files`
           - *(Conditional:* :guilabel:`Log Rotation` *=* ``ON`` *)* 
             Type how many rotated log files may stay uncompressed in
             the log directory before they are archived and compressed.
             (The suggested number is ``2``.)

         * - :guilabel:`Max Percent of Disk`
           - *(Conditional:* :guilabel:`Log Rotation` *=* ``ON`` *)*
             Type the percentage of disk space on the host the log 
             files may consume before older files are deleted. (The 
             suggested number is ``5``.)
