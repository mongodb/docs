Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB provides the ability to perform
multi-document transactions for sharded clusters.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-beta.rst

The following page lists concerns specific to running transactions on a
sharded cluster. These concerns are in addition to those listed in
:doc:`/core/transactions-production-consideration`.

Sharded Transctions and MongoDB Drivers
---------------------------------------

For transactions on sharded clusters, clients require MongoDB drivers
updated for MongoDB 4.2.

.. topic:: Sharded Transactions and MongoDB 4.0 drivers

   On sharded clusters with multiple :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances,
   performing transactions with drivers updated for MongoDB 4.0 (instead
   of MongoDB 4.2) will fail and can result in errors, including:

   .. note::

      Your driver may return a different error. Refer to your driver's
      documentation for details.

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 80
   
      * - Error Code
        - Error Message
   
      * - 251
        - ``cannot continue txnId -1 for session ... with txnId 1``

      * - 50940
        - ``cannot commit with no participants``

Performance
-----------

Single Shard
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transactions that target a single shard should have the same
performance as replica-set transactions.

Multiple Shards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transactions that affect multiple shards incur a greater performance
cost.

.. note::

   On a sharded cluster, transactions that span multiple shards will
   error and abort if any involved shard contains an arbiter.

Time Limit
~~~~~~~~~~

To specify a time limit, specify a ``maxTimeMS`` limit on
``commitTransaction``. If ``maxTimeMS`` is unspecified, MongoDB will use the
:parameter:`transactionLifetimeLimitSeconds`.

If ``maxTimeMS`` is specified but would result in transaction that
exceeds :parameter:`transactionLifetimeLimitSeconds`, MongoDB will use
the :parameter:`transactionLifetimeLimitSeconds`.

Read Concerns
-------------

Multi-document transactions support :readconcern:`"local"`,
:readconcern:`"majority"`, and :readconcern:`"snapshot"` read concern
levels.

For transactions on a sharded cluster, only the
:readconcern:`"snapshot"` read concern provides a consistent snapshot
across multiple shards.

For more information on read concern and transactions, see
:ref:`transactions-read-concern`.


Arbiters
--------

On a sharded cluster, transactions that span multiple shards will error
and abort if any involved shard contains an arbiter.

Three Member Primary-Secondary-Arbiter Shards
---------------------------------------------

For a sharded cluster with a three-member PSA shards, you may have
:ref:`disabled read concern "majority" <disable-read-concern-majority>`
to avoid cache pressure.

For a sharded cluster that has disabled read concern ``"majority"``:

- A transaction with read concern ``snapshot`` errors if the
  transaction involves a shard with read concern ``"majority"``
  disabled.

- A transaction that spans multiple shards errors if the transaction
  involves a shard with read concern ``"majority"`` disabled.

To check if read concern "majority" is disabled
(:option:`--enableMajorityReadConcern false <mongod
--enableMajorityReadConcern>` or
:setting:`replication.enableMajorityReadConcern: false
<replication.enableMajorityReadConcern>`), you can run
:method:`db.serverStatus()` and check the
:serverstatus:`storageEngine.supportsCommittedReads` field. If
``false``, read concern "majority" is disabled.
