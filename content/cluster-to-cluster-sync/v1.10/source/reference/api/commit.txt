Description
-----------

Finalizes the sync between the source cluster and the destination
cluster and stops continuous sync between clusters.

For more information, see :ref:`c2c-cutover-process`.

Requirements
------------

Before using the ``commit`` endpoint:

- Stop your application to prevent any further writes to the source cluster. 
  During commit, you may still read from the source cluster.
  
  .. warning:: 

     If you write to the source cluster during commit, you might experience 
     data loss. 

- Use the :ref:`progress <c2c-api-progress>` endpoint to confirm the
  following values:

  - ``lagTimeSeconds`` for ``mongosync``, the source cluster 
    for the verifier, and the destination cluster for the 
    verifier are all near ``0`` (*Recommended, but not required*)

    .. note:: lagTimeSeconds

       ``lagTimeSeconds`` indicates the time between the last applied
       event and time of the current latest event. When you send a
       ``commit`` request, ``mongosync`` enters the ``COMMITTING`` state
       for the amount of seconds reported by ``lagTimeSeconds``, and
       then transitions to the ``COMMITTED`` state.
       
       When ``lagTimeSeconds`` is ``0``, the source and destination
       clusters are in a consistent state.

       For more information on the ``lagTimeSeconds`` fields, see
       :ref:`c2c-api-progress`.

  - ``state: "RUNNING"``
  - ``canCommit: true``

Request
-------

.. code-block:: http
   :copyable: false

   POST /api/v1/commit 

Request Body Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: includes/api/facts/no-body-parameters.rst

Response
--------

.. include:: /includes/api/tables/basic-response.rst

Example
-------

The following example commits the synchronization operation to the
destination cluster.

Confirm that the Synchronization is Ready
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before sending a request to the ``commit`` endpoint, use the
:ref:`progress <c2c-api-progress>` endpoint to confirm that the
synchronization is ready to be committed.

Request
```````

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/progress.sh
   :language: shell

Response
````````

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/responses/progress.json
   :language: shell
   :emphasize-lines: 5
   :copyable: false

The ``progress`` endpoint returned ``"canCommit":true``, which means
that the ``commit`` request can run successfully.

Send the Commit Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following command sends a request to the ``commit`` endpoint:

Request
```````

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/requests/commit.sh
   :language: shell

Response
````````

.. literalinclude:: /includes/api/responses/success.json
   :language: json
   :copyable: false

Behavior
--------

State
~~~~~

If the ``commit`` request is successful, ``mongosync`` enters the
``COMMITTED`` state. Once ``mongosync`` enters the ``COMMITTED`` state,
continuous sync between the clusters stops. 

Data Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-verification

.. _c2c-collection-changes:

Collection Characteristic Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``commit`` restores collection characteristics that ``mongosync`` temporarily
alters during synchronization. 

The following table illustrates the impact of ``commit`` on collection
characteristics that ``mongosync`` alters during the synchronization process.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Collection Characteristic
     - Impact of ``commit`` 
   * - Unique Indexes
     - ``commit`` resets unique indexes that ``mongosync`` replicated as
       non-unique on the destination cluster.

   * - TTL Indexes
     - ``commit`` resets ``expireAfterSeconds`` which ``mongosync`` set
       to the value of ``MAX_INT`` on the destination cluster.

   * - Hidden Indexes
     - ``commit`` resets hidden indexes that ``mongosync``
       replicated as non-hidden on the destination cluster.

   * - Write Blocking
     - If you enable write-blocking, ``mongosync`` blocks writes: 
       
       - On the destination cluster during sync.
       - On the source cluster when ``commit`` is received.

       See also:
       :ref:`c2c-write-blocking`
  
   * - Capped Collections
     - ``commit`` resets the required maximum size of capped collections
       which ``mongosync`` set to the maximum allowable size on the
       destination cluster.
