Priority 0 Replica Set Members
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

A *priority 0* member is similar to a secondary except that it cannot
become a :term:`primary` and it cannot *trigger* an :term:`election`.
The member otherwise functions as a secondary. It maintains a copy of
the data set, accepts read operations, and votes in elections. You can
use the *priority 0* setting to prevent :term:`secondaries <secondary>`
located outside the main data center from becoming primary.

In the following three-member replica set, the first data center
contains the primary and a secondary. The second data center contains a
*priority 0* member that cannot become primary.

Priority 0 Members as Standbys
------------------------------

A *priority 0* member can function as a standby. In some replica sets,
it might not be possible to add a new member in a reasonable amount of
time. A standby holds an up-to-date copy of the data for the purpose of
replacing a secondary that fails or goes offline.

In many cases, you need not configure a standby as *priority 0*. But in
sets with varied hardware availability or :ref:`geographic distribution
<replica-set-geographical-distribution>`, a *priority 0* standby ensures
that only qualified members become primary.

A priority 0* standby may also be valuable when your primary and any hot
standbys have different hardware specifications than the other members
of the set. In these cases, deploy a member as a *priority 0* member to
ensure it can vote in elections but not become primary. (You also can
use a :ref:`hidden <replica-set-hidden-members>` member for this
purpose.)

If your set already has seven voting members, set the standby's
:data:`~local.system.replset.members[n].votes` value to ``0``. This
ensures it does not vote in elections.

Priority 0 Members and Failover
-------------------------------

When configuring a *priority 0* member, consider the likely failover
scenarios, such as inter-site network partitions. Always ensure that
your main data center contains both a quorum of voting members and
contains members that are eligible to be primary.

Configuration
-------------

To configure a *priority 0* member, see
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-secondary-only-replica-set-member`.
