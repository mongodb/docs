   a. Drag the ``storeLocation`` field to the :guilabel:`X Axis`
      encoding channel. The :guilabel:`X Axis` encoding channel
      dictates which field to use when creating the column groups.

      .. example:: X Axis Encoding Channel

         Using ``storeLocation`` for this encoding channel allows us
         to visualize a group of items per store location.

   #. In the :guilabel:`Fields` section click the ``items`` field to
      expand the ``items`` object and view its properties.

   #. Drag the ``items.name`` field to the :guilabel:`Y Axis`
      encoding channel. The :guilabel:`Y Axis` encoding channel
      determines which field to use for the chart's
      :manual:`aggregation </aggregation>`.

      .. example:: Y Axis Encoding Channel

         Using ``items.name`` for this encoding channel allows us to
         aggregate and count the items sold in each location.

   #. In the :guilabel:`Array Reductions` dropdown, select
      :guilabel:`Unwind array`.

   #. In the :guilabel:`Aggregate` dropdown, select :guilabel:`count`.

      .. example:: Count

         The :guilabel:`count` option counts the occurrences of each
         item name after unwinding the ``items`` array and displays
         them in the chart grouped by store location.

         For more information on the ``$count`` aggregation command,
         refer to the
         :manual:`count aggregation documentation </reference/operator/aggregation/count/>`.

   #. Drag the ``items.name`` field to the :guilabel:`Series` encoding
      channel.

      .. example:: Series Encoding Channel

         The :guilabel:`Series` encoding channel dictates how to
         split each group of the chart. Each member of the series
         becomes a column within the group, so each item name becomes a
         column within the store location group.

   #. In the :guilabel:`Series Array Reductions` dropdown, select
      :guilabel:`Unwind array`.

   Your chart should now look something like this:

   .. figure:: /images/charts/tutorial-grouped-column-in-progress-2.png
      :figwidth: 750px
      :alt: Grouped Column Chart Builder

   The item sales look to be fairly evenly distributed by store
   location. Notice based on this chart that ``notepads`` are
   the most common item sold at all store locations, which is
   useful information when stocking each store with its
   inventory.
