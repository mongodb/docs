Isolation Guarantees
--------------------

Read Uncommitted
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/concurrent-operations-read-uncommitted.rst

Read uncommitted is the default isolation level and applies to
:program:`mongod` standalone instances as well as to replica sets and
sharded clusters.

Read Uncommitted And Single Document Atomicity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/concurrent-operations-single-document-write.rst

However, although the readers may not see a *partially* updated
document, read uncommitted means that concurrent readers may still see
the updated document before the changes are :term:`durable`.

Read Uncommitted And Multiple Document Write
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/concurrent-operations-multi-document-writes.rst

Without isolating the multi-document write operations, MongoDB exhibits
the following behavior:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/concurrent-operations-multi-document-writes-no-isolation.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/concurrent-operations-isolate-operator.rst
