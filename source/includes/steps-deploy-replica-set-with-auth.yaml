  You can use :doc:`built-in roles </reference/built-in-roles>` to create
  common types of database users, such as the :authrole:`dbOwner` role to
  create a database administrator, the :authrole:`readWrite` role to
  create a user who can update data, or the :authrole:`read` role to
  create user who can search data but no more. You also can define
  :ref:`custom roles <user-defined-roles>`.

    For example, the following creates a database administrator for the
    ``products`` database:
  language: javascript
  code: |
    db.createUser(
      {
        user: "productsDBAdmin",
        pwd: "password",
        roles:
        [
          {
            role: "dbOwner",
            db: "products"
          }
        ]
      }
    )
