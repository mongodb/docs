|service| supports deploying clusters onto Microsoft Azure. This
page provides reference material related to |service| cluster deployments on
:abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)`.

Depending on your instance size, |service| supports the following

Instance Configuration Options
------------------------------

Each |service| instance size comes with a default set of resources. |service|
provides the following resource configuration options:

Custom Storage Size
   The size of the server root volume. |service| clusters deployed onto
   :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)` use premium storage disks. 
   [#azure-disk-docs]_

   The following instance sizes are available:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 50 50

      * - Instance size
        - Maximum disk storage

      * - ``M0``
        - 512MB

      * - ``M2``
        - 2GB

      * - ``M5``
        - 5GB

      * - ``M20``
        - 128GB

      * - ``M30``
        - 256GB

      * - ``M40``
        - 512GB

      * - ``M50``
        - 2TB

      * - ``M60``
        - 4TB

   
   Workloads typically require less than ``2TB``.

|service| configures the following resources automatically and does not allow
user modification:

Storage Speed
   The input/output operations per second (IOPS) [#azure-disk-docs]_ the
   system can perform. This value is fixed based on the specified
   custom storage size.

Encrypted Storage Volumes
   :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)` storage volumes are
   `always encrypted 
   <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-managed-disks-sse/>`_.

.. _microsoft-azure-availability-zones:

Azure Fault Domains
-------------------

Each :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)` region includes a set number of fault
domains. Fault domains consist of a group of virtual machines that share a
common power source and network switch. For regions that have at least three
fault domains (3FD), |service| deploys clusters across three fault domains.
For regions that only have two fault domains (2FD), |service| deploys clusters
across two fault domains.

The |service| :doc:`Add New Cluster </create-new-cluster>` form marks regions
that support :abbr:`3FD (Three Fault Domain)` clusters as
:guilabel:`Recommended`, as they provide higher availability.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/fact-no-node-restriction-azure.rst

For general information on :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)` regions and fault 
domains, see `Manage the availability of Windows virtual machines in Azure
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability>`_

Regions with at Least Three Fault Domains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the selected :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)` region has at least three
fault domains, |service| clusters are split across three fault domains. For
example, a three node replica set cluster would have one node deployed onto
each zone.

.. include:: /images/microsoft-azure-3az.rst

:abbr:`3FD (Three Fault Domain)` clusters have higher availability
compared to :abbr:`2FD (Two Fault Domain)` clusters. However, not all
regions support :abbr:`3FD (Three Fault Domain)` clusters.


Regions with Only Two Fault Domains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the selected :abbr:`Azure (Microsoft Azure)` region has two fault domains,
|service| clusters are split across the two fault domains. For example, a
three node replica set cluster would have two nodes deployed to one zone and
the remaining node deployed to the other zone.

.. include:: /images/microsoft-azure-2az.rst

:abbr:`2FD (Two Fault Domain)` clusters have a higher chance of loss of
availability in the event of the loss of an zone than :abbr:`3FD
(Three Fault Domain)` clusters. However, where latency or location are a
priority, a region that supports :abbr:`2FD (Two Fault Domain)` clusters
may be preferred.
