.. _billing-overview:

Billing settings are configured at the organization level and apply to
all projects within that organization. You can examine costs at the
organization level or the project level.

To configure the payment method and billing profile for an
organization, or to view the most recent and pending charges for
an organization, access the organization's :guilabel:`Billing` section
through |service|.

|service|:

- charges by the hour for your MongoDB {+clusters+}
- charges for usage of your MongoDB {+serverless-instances+}
- tabulates costs daily
- displays your current monthly costs on the
  :ref:`Invoices page <view-current-invoice>`

To view line-item charges,
:ref:`view all of your invoices <view-past-invoices>`.

As you configure a {+database-deployment+}, you can view the total 
cost, except for data transfer, before applying your settings.

Payment Method
--------------

To pay for your |service| usage, you can:

- Pay with an
  :ref:`accepted payment method <payment-alternatives>`.
- Pay with a MongoDB |service|
  :ref:`subscription <atlas-subscriptions>`.

.. note::

   Contact :website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>` to:

   - Purchase a subscription. Your
     :ref:`subscription level <subscription-level>` determines your
     access to support and other entitlements.

   - Review alternative billing methods.

.. important::
   
   To confirm your credit card information, |service| charges $1.00 
   when you first connect a credit card to your account. After 
   |service| confirms your information, it refunds the $1.00 charge. If 
   you encounter any issues with connecting a credit card to your 
   account, reach out to your card provider or banking institution. 
   Verify whether they declined the initial charge, which would prevent 
   |service| from confirming your information.

   :figwidth: 100%

You can view usage data by service, by project, or by deployment:

By Service 
``````````

The :guilabel:`Usage` chart displays stacked columns representing the 
total cost for each type of |service| service you have used across all 
of your projects each month.

|service| services include:

- {+Clusters+}
- {+Serverless-instances+} 
- |charts|
- |data-lakes| 
- |fts|
- Backup
- Data transfer
- Other |service| features

By Project 
``````````

The :guilabel:`Usage` chart displays stacked columns representing the 
total cost incurred by each of your projects each month.

.. note::
   
   The :guilabel:`By Project` view is unavailable for organizations 
   using 20 or more projects.

By Deployment 
`````````````

The :guilabel:`Usage` chart displays stacked columns representing the 
costs incurred by each of your {+clusters+} and 
{+serverless-instances+} each month. It does not include data transfer 
costs for |charts-short| and |data-lake|.

.. note:: 
   
   The :guilabel:`By Deployment` view is unavailable for:

   - Organizations using 20 or more deployments
   - Cloud Manager

Invoice Charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of your invoices displays :guilabel:`Total Usage` and 
:guilabel:`By Deployment` charts. The charts do not include 
subscription charges.

   :figwidth: 60%

The :guilabel:`Total Usage` chart displays the costs incurred by your 
|service| usage over the invoice period. You can filter usage by 
service to view charges incurred by a particular |service| service.

|service| services include:

- {+Clusters+}
- {+Serverless-instances+}
- |charts|
- |data-lakes| 
- |fts|

usage incurred by each of your {+deployments+} across all of your 
projects. {+Deployments+} are {+clusters+} and {+serverless-instances+}.

You can filter the chart by project to view charges incurred by 
{+deployments+} in a particular project.

.. _cross-org-billing:

Cross-Organization Billing
--------------------------

*Cross-organization billing* is an |service| subscription feature that 
enables you to share a billing subscription across multiple 
:doc:`organizations </tutorial/manage-organizations/>` and to pay a 
single invoice for them. After 
:ref:`configuring a paying organization <configure-paying-org>`, you 
pay invoices for the paying organization that include a list of charges 
incurred for all linked organizations.

A paying organization's invoice displays:

- the :guilabel:`Running Total` of the paying organization's charges, 
  and

- the :guilabel:`Combined Total` of the paying and linked 
  organizations' charges.

.. figure:: /images/paying-org-invoice.png
   :alt: The paying organization invoice shows costs incurred for that 
         organization and a list of costs for linked organizations
   :figwidth: 100%

Linked organizations are subject to the subscription agreement of the 
paying organization, including the level of support, the charges 
associated with the subscription, discounts, and payment terms.

Linked Organization Invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You pay for all linked organization usage through the paying 
organization. However, each linked organization still produces a 
monthly invoice to help you account for usage.

Linked organization invoices include all charges incurred by that 
organization, as well as a percentage of your total cross-organization 
billing subscription cost proportional to that organization's usage.

Each day, |service| bills linked and paying organizations for
subscription uplift based on their own usage.

At the end of a paying organization's billing period, |service| bills
linked and paying organizations proportionally to their usage for the unmet 
monthly minimum, if there is one.

.. example::
   A paying organization has an |service| Pro subscription and two 
   linked organizations. The paying organization incurs no charges. 
   
   Linked organization #1 incurs $400 in subscription uplift charges 
   while linked organization #2 incurs $200 in subscription uplift 
   charges. The paying organization has a monthly minimum of $799, so 
   at the end of the month, the unmet $199 is proportionally distributed 
   across invoices for linked organizations #1 and #2:

   - |service| charges linked organization #1 $132.70 of the unmet $199 
     because it incurred 2/3 of the total charges.

   - |service| charges linked organization #2 $66.30 of the unmet $199 
     because it incurred 1/3 of the total charges.

   You still pay all charges through the paying organization.

.. note::
   
   At the end of the paying organization's billing period, simultaneous 
   charges for daily subscription uplift and an unmet minimum could 
   trigger daily maximum billing alerts.

.. _cross-org-billing-use-cases:

Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~

Cross-organization billing can be useful for establishing broad levels 
of authorization using |service| organizations, and for exceeding the 
250-project limit on |service| organizations.

.. example::

   A company with sales and engineering teams might need 
   significantly different organization-level authorization for each, 
   but still want to receive a single invoice for the company's 
   database use. That company could create and link sales and 
   engineering organizations to a paying organization to pay all costs 
   through that paying organization, while maintaining control over the 
   authorizations of each team organization.

   A company with over 250 projects might create new organizations for 
   new projects, then link them all to a paying organization to 
   maintain a single source of invoicing.

.. _configure-paying-org:

Configure a Paying Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prerequisites
`````````````

- A paying organization must have an |service| subscription that 
  includes cross-organization billing.
  
- To configure a paying organization, you must have
  :authrole:`Organization Billing Admin` privileges.

.. note::
   To learn more or to purchase a subscription that enables
   cross-organization billing, contact 
   :website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>`.

To configure a paying organization and link other organizations to it:

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-paying-organization.rst

The :guilabel:`Linked Organizations` tab displays your linked 
organizations. To link additional organizations, click 
:guilabel:`Link More Organizations`.

Billing Quota Management
------------------------

You can use :ref:`billing alerts <billing-alerts>` to help manage your
billing quotas. Billing alerts notify a designated person when a bill
has exceeded a |usd| limit, or when a credit card is about to expire.

To :ref:`configure billing alerts <configure-alert-settings-tabs>`,
click Organization :guilabel:`Alerts` in the :guilabel:`Organization`
view.
