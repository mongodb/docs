Convert Config Servers to a Replica Set
=======================================

.. important:: Deprecation notice

   This procedure was deprecated as of 15 August 2019. It is no
   longer supported.

In a sharded cluster, :manual:`config servers  </reference/glossary/#std-term-config-server>` store the
metadata for the :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`. For a
sharded cluster to be fully operational, the config servers must be
available and the metadata must be consistent across the config
servers.

Config servers that run the WiredTiger storage engine can be
deployed as replica sets. Running config servers as replica sets
improves consistency and increases availability for the config
servers. |mms| automatically deploys config servers as replica sets
for all new sharded cluster deployments using
:doc:`MongoDB 3.2 or later </tutorial/change-mongodb-version>`.
However, you must must convert config servers to replica sets for
existing MongoDB 3.2 sharded cluster deployments before you can
upgrade. You can manage config server replica sets just as you would
any other replica set.

.. warning::

   If you have backup enabled and if you convert a sharded cluster's
   config servers to a replica set, then |mms| Automation can no longer
   use snapshots created before the conversion to restore the sharded
   cluster. Automation can only use snapshots created after the
   conversion.

Prerequisites
-------------

- .. include:: /includes/extracts/csrs-conversion-cloud-services-version-prereq.rst

- MongoDB 3.2.4 or Later
    To convert the config servers to a replica set, the sharded cluster
    must be running MongoDB 3.2.4 or later. To upgrade the
    MongoDB version, see :doc:`/tutorial/change-mongodb-version`.

- Three Config Servers to Convert
    The sharded cluster must be running exactly three config servers to
    convert. After the conversion of the config servers to a replica
    set, you can add additional members to the config server replica
    set.

- Write Permission for Parent Directory of ``dbPath``
    The {+aagent+} must have write permission on the **parent**
    directory of the ``dbPath`` of each config server.

Procedure
---------

.. note::

   During the conversion of the config servers to a replica set,

   - If the config servers use the MMAPv1 :manual:`storage engine </reference/glossary/#std-term-storage-engine>`, |mms|
     changes the storage engine to
     :manual:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>`.

   - The {+mdbagent+} creates temporary config servers as part of the
     conversion process and deletes them after the conversion. If your
     {+mdbagent+} detects them at any point during the
     conversion, they appear as unreachable hosts in your
     deployments list. After the conversion, you can safely delete them
     from the list. See :doc:`/tutorial/unmanage-deployment`.
