.. dbcommand:: reshardCollection

   .. versionadded:: 5.0

   The :dbcommand:`reshardCollection` command changes the shard key for
   a collection and changes the distribution of your data.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`sh.reshardCollection` 
      helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-only.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-atlas-support-all.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

                
Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand(
      {
        reshardCollection: "<database>.<collection>",
        key: <shardkey>,
        unique: <boolean>,
        numInitialChunks: <integer>,
        collation: { locale: "simple" },
        zones: [
            {
                min: <document with same shape as shardkey>,
                max: <document with same shape as shardkey>,
                zone: <string> | null
            },
            ...
        ]
      }
   )

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 20 75
 
   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
 
   * - ``reshardCollection``
     - string
     - The :term:`namespace` of the collection to be resharded. Takes
       the form ``<database>.<collection>``.
 
   * - ``key``
     - document
     - The document that specifies the new field or fields to use as the
       :ref:`shard key <sharding-shard-key>`.
 
       ``{ <field1>: <1|"hashed">, ... }``
 
       Set the field values to either:
 
       - ``1`` for :doc:`ranged based sharding </core/ranged-sharding>`
 
       - ``"hashed"`` to specify a
         :ref:`hashed shard key <hashed-shard-keys>`.
 
         See also :ref:`sharding-shard-key-indexes`
 
   * - ``unique``
     - boolean
     - Optional. Specify whether there is a :doc:`uniqueness
       </core/index-unique>` constraint on the shard key. Only
       ``false`` is supported. Defaults to ``false``.
 
   * - ``numInitialChunks``
     - integer
     - Optional. Specifies the initial number of chunks to create
       across all shards in the cluster when resharding a collection.
       The default is the number of chunks that exist for the
       collection under the current shard key pattern. MongoDB will
       then create and balance chunks across the cluster. The
       ``numInitialChunks`` must result in less than ``8192`` per shard.
 
   * - ``collation``
     - document
     - Optional. If the collection specified to ``reshardCollection``
       has a default :ref:`collation <collation>`, you *must* include a 
       collation document with ``{ locale : "simple" }``, or the 
       ``reshardCollection`` command fails.
 
   * - ``zones``
     - array
     - Optional. To maintain or add :ref:`zones <zone-sharding>`,
       specify the zones for your collection in an array.

Considerations

Resharding Process
------------------

.. include:: /includes/reshard-collection-introduction.rst

Initialization Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the initialization phase, the resharding coordinator determines
the new data distribution for the sharded collection.

Index Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~

During the index phase:

- Each shard recipient creates a new, empty sharded collection with the
  same collection options as the existing sharded collection. This new
  sharded collection is the target for where recipient shards write the
  new data.
- Each shard recipient builds the necessary new indexes. These include
  all existing indexes on the sharded collection and an index compatible
  with the new shard key pattern if such an index doesn’t already exist on
  the sharded collection.

Clone, Apply, and Catch-up Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the clone, apply, and catch-up phase:

- Each shard recipient clones an initial copy of the documents it would
  own under the new shard key.
- Each shard recipient begins applying oplog entries from operations
  that happened after the recipient cloned the data.
- When the estimate for the time remaining to complete the resharding
  operation is under **two seconds**, the resharding coordinator blocks
  writes for the collection.

  .. note::

     If desired, you can manually force the resharding operation to
     complete by issuing the :dbcommand:`commitReshardCollection`
     command. This is useful if the current time estimate to complete
     the resharding operation is an acceptable duration for your
     collection to block writes. The
     :dbcommand:`commitReshardCollection` command blocks writes early
     and forces the resharding operation to complete. During the time
     period where writes are blocked your application experiences an
     increase in latency.

.. _resharding-commit-phase-command:

Commit Phase
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Once the resharding process reaches the commit phase, it may no longer
  be aborted with :dbcommand:`abortReshardCollection`.
- When all shards have reached strict consistency, the resharding
  coordinator commits the resharding operation and installs the new
  routing table.
- The resharding coordinator instructs each donor and recipient shard
  primary, independently, to rename the temporary sharded collection.
  The temporary collection becomes the new resharded collection.
- Each donor shard drops the old sharded collection.

Example
-------

Reshard a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example reshards the ``sales.orders`` collection with the
new shard key ``{ order_id: 1 }``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand({
     reshardCollection: "sales.orders",
     key: { order_id: 1 }
   })

MongoDB returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     ok: 1,
     '$clusterTime': {
       clusterTime: Timestamp(1, 1624887954),
       signature: {
         hash: Binary(Buffer.from("0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "hex"), 0),
         keyId: 0
       }
     },
     operationTime: Timestamp(1, 1624887947)
   }
