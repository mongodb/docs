.. dbcommand:: isMaster

   The :dbcommand:`isMaster` command provides a basic overview of the current
   replication configuration. MongoDB :term:`drivers <driver>` and
   :term:`clients <client>` use this command to determine what kind of
   member they're connected to and to discover additional members of a
   :term:`replica set`. The :method:`db.isMaster()` method provides a
   wrapper around this database command.

   The command takes the following form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { isMaster: 1 }

   This command returns a :term:`document` containing the
   following fields:

   .. data:: isMaster.setname

      The name of the current replica set, if applicable.

   .. data:: isMaster.ismaster

      A boolean value that reports when this node is writable. If
      ``true``, then the current node is either a :term:`primary` in a
      :term:`replica set`, a :term:`master` in a master-slave
      configuration, or a standalone :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

   .. data:: isMaster.secondary

      A boolean value that, when ``true``, indicates that the
      current member is a :term:`secondary` member of a :term:`replica
      set`.

   .. data:: isMaster.hosts

      An array of strings in the format of "``[hostname]:[port]``"
      listing all members of the :term:`replica set` that are not
      ":term:`hidden <hidden member>`".

   .. data:: isMaster.arbiter

      An array of strings  in the format of "``[hostname]:[port]``"
      listing all members of the :term:`replica set` that are
      :term:`arbiters <arbiter>`

      Only appears in the :dbcommand:`isMaster` response for replica
      sets that have arbiter members.

   .. data:: isMaster.arbiterOnly

      A boolean value that, when ``true`` indicates that the current
      instance is an :term:`arbiter`.

      :data:`~isMaster.arbiterOnly` only appears in the
      :dbcommand:`isMaster` response from arbiters.

   .. data:: isMaster.primary

      The ``[hostname]:[port]`` for the current
      :term:`replica set` :term:`primary`, if applicable.

   .. data:: isMaster.me

      The ``[hostname]:[port]`` of the node responding to this
      command.

   .. data:: isMaster.maxBsonObjectSize

      The maximum permitted size of a :term:`BSON` object in bytes for
      this :binary:`~bin.mongod` process. If not provided, clients should
      assume a max size of "``4 * 1024 * 1024``".

   .. data:: isMaster.localTime

      .. versionadded:: 2.1.1

      Returns the local server time in UTC. This value is a
      :term:`ISOdate`. You can use the :js:func:`toString()`
      JavaScript method to convert this value to a local date string,
      as in the following example:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.isMaster().localTime.toString();
