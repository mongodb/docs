Current Operation Reporting
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionchanged:: 2.2

The :method:`db.currentOp()` helper in the :program:`mongo` shell
reports on the current operations running on the :program:`mongod`
instance. The command returns the ``inprog`` array which contains a
document for each in progress operation. Consider the following
example output:

.. code-block::

   {
     "inprog": [
                {
                        "opid" : 3434473,
                        "active" : <boolean>,
                        "secs_running" : 0,
                        "op" : "<operation>",
                        "ns" : "<database>.<collection>",
                        "query" : {
                        },
                        "client" : "<host>:<outgoing>",
                        "desc" : "conn57683",
                        "threadId" : "0x7f04a637b700",
                        "connectionId" : 57683,
                        "locks" : {
                                "^" : "w",
                                "^local" : "W",
                                "^<database>" : "W"
                        },
                        "waitingForLock" : false,
                        "msg": "<string>"
                        "numYields" : 0,
                        "progress" : {
                                "done" : <number>,
                                "total" : <number>
                        }
                        "lockStats" : {
                                "timeLockedMicros" : {
                                        "r" : NumberLong(),
                                        "w" : NumberLong()
                                },
                                "timeAcquiringMicros" : {
                                        "r" : NumberLong(),
                                        "w" : NumberLong()
                                }
                        }
                },
               ]
   }

.. optional::

   You may specify the ``true`` argument to :method:`db.currentOp()`
   to return full output. For example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.currentOp(true)

   Furthermore, active operations (i.e. where :data:`active` are
   ``true``) will return additional fields.

:method:`db.currentOp()`.

Output Reference
----------------

.. data:: opid

   Holds an identifier for the operation. You can pass this value to
   :method:`db.killOp()` in the :program:`mongo` shell to terminate an
   operation.

.. data:: active

   A boolean value, that reports if the option is currently running,
   with the ``true`` value, or queued and waiting for a lock to run,
   with the ``false`` value.

.. data:: secs_running

   The duration of this operation in seconds.

.. data:: op

   A string that identifies the type of operation. The possible values
   are:

   - ``insert``
   - ``query``
   - ``update``
   - ``delete``
   - ``getmore``
   - ``command``

.. data:: ns

   The :term:`namespace` that this operation targets. Namespaces are
   formed using the name of the :term:`database` and the name of the
   :term:`collection`.

.. data:: query

   A document containing the current operation's query. This document
   is empty for operations that do not have queries: ``getmore``,
   ``insert``, ``delete``, and ``command``.

.. data:: client

   The IP address (or hostname) and the ephemeral port of the client
   connection where this operation originates. If your ``inprog``
   array has operations from many different clients, use this string
   to relate operations to clients.

.. data:: desc

   A description of the client. This string includes the
   :data:`connectionId`.

.. data:: threadId

   An identifier for the thread that services this operations and its
   connection.

.. data:: connectionId

   An identifier for the connection where this operation originated.

.. data:: locks

   The :data:`locks` document reports on the kinds of locks that this
   operation currently holds. The following lock types are possible:

   .. data:: locks.^

      :data:`locks.^` reports on the global lock state for the
      :program:`mongod` instance. The operation must hold this for
      some global phases of an operation.

   .. data:: locks.^local

      :data:`locks.^` reports on the lock for the ``local``
      database. MongoDB uses the ``local`` database for a number of
      operations, but the most frequent use of the ``local`` database
      is for the :term:`oplog` used in replication.

   .. data:: locks.^<database>

      :data:`locks.^<database>` reports on the lock state for the
      database that this operation targets.

.. data:: waitingForLock

   Returns a boolean value. :data:`waitingForLock` is ``true`` if the
   operation is waiting for a lock and ``false`` if the operation has
   the locks that it needs to complete.

.. data:: msg

   The :data:`msg` provides a message that describes the status and
   progress of the operation. In the case of indexing operations, this
   field reports the completion percentage.

.. data:: numYields

   :data:`numYields` is a counter that reports the number of time that
   this operation has yielded to allow other operations to complete.

   Typically, operations will yield when they need to access that that
   is not yet in memory while MongoDB pages in that data. This allows
   other operations that are already in memory, to complete quickly
   while MongoDB reads the data for the first operation into memory.

.. data:: lockStats

   The :data:`lockStats` document reflects the amount of time that a
   this operation has spent both acquiring and holding
   locks. :data:`lockStats` reports data on a per-lock type, with the
   following possible lock types:

   - ``r`` represents the database specific read lock and
   - ``w`` represents the database specific write lock.

    .. data:: timeLockedMicros

       The :data:`timeLockedMicros` document reports the amount of
       time this operation has spent holding specific locks.

       .. data:: timeLockedMicros.r

          Reports the amount of time that this operation has held the
          database specific read lock in microseconds.

       .. data:: timeLockedMicros.w

          Reports the amount of time that this operation has held the
          database specific write lock in microseconds.

   .. data:: timeAquiringMicros

      The :data:`timeLockedMicros` document reports the amount of time
      this operation has spent *waiting* to acquire a specific lock.

      .. data:: timeAcquiringMicros.r

         Reports the mount of time the operation has waited for the
         database specific read lock in microseconds.

      .. data:: timeAcquiringMicros.w

         Reports the mount of time the operation has waited for the
         database specific write lock in microseconds.
