===================================
Activate |backup| for a Replica Set
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. start-content

Overview
--------

You can start, restart, stop, and terminate backups for replica
sets. As appropriate, you also can specify which instance to use for
the initial sync, exclude namespaces, authenticate, and change the
snapshot schedule and retention.

.. note::
   The replica set must be MongoDB version 2.0 or later.

Considerations
--------------

Excluded namespaces are databases or collections that MMS will not
back up. This can be useful for namespaces containing log files or
caches, for instance, as well as reduce backup time and costs.

You can take snapshots every 6, 8, 12, or 24 hours and save for 2-5
days. By default, MMS will retain daily snapshots for up to 180 days,
MMS will retain weekly snapshots for up to 52 weeks, and monthly
snapshots for up to 36 months.

By default, MMS takes snapshots every 6 hours. MMS stores these
snapshots for 2 days, for point in time restores. The standard
retention policy keeps daily snapshots for a week, weekly snapshots
for a month, and monthly snapshots for a year.
   
.. only:: hosted

   You can set point-in-time restores going back 1, 2, 3, or 4 days.

Changes to the snapshot schedule will affect your snapshot storage costs. The
longer your snapshot window, the longer it will take to build a point in time
restore.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/backup-activate-replica-set.rst

Your Backup agent will start polling the specified instance for this replica
set.

See the :doc:`/faq/backup` page for more details about backup configuration,
namespaces, authentication, and snapshots.
