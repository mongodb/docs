On the :guilabel:`Data Sources` page, an |service| 
:authrole:`Project Owner` can:

- :ref:`Connect a deployment <connect-deployment>` to |charts|.
- :ref:`Disconnect a deployment <disconnect-deployment>` from 
  |charts|.
- Modify :ref:`deployment settings <access-deployment-settings-page>`.
  
To manage data source settings, see :ref:`manage-existing-data-sources`.

.. _connect-deployment:

Connect a Deployment to |charts-short|
--------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-charts-connects-by-default.rst

You can connect a deployment to |charts-short| to access the
data for the collections within the deployment in |charts-short|.

To connect a deployment to |charts-short|:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/steps-access-deployment.rst

   .. include:: /includes/steps-connect-deployment.rst

      To learn more about the other information that displays for the
      deployment, see :ref:`manage-deployment`.

.. _disconnect-deployment:

Disconnect a Deployment from |charts-short|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Disconnect a deployment to disconnect all data sources within the
deployment from |charts-short|.

If you disconnect a deployment, you can :ref:`reconnect
<connect-deployment>` it later to resume rendering charts that use the
deployment's data sources.

To disconnect a deployment:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/steps-access-deployment.rst

   .. step:: Check the connection status and disconnect the deployment.

      If the deployment connection status is :guilabel:`Disconnected`,
      the deployment is already disconnected from |charts-short|.
      
      If the deployment connection status is :guilabel:`Connected`:
      
      a. Click the disconnect icon :icon-fa5:`unlink` next to the deployment connection
         status. The :guilabel:`Disconnect Deployment` modal appears.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Check for connected charts` to
         learn whether any charts use the deployment's collections as a
         data source.
      #. Click :guilabel:`Disconnect`.
      
      The deployment disconnects from |charts-short|.

.. _access-deployment-settings-page:

Access Deployment Settings
--------------------------

To manage a deployment in |charts-short|:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/steps-access-deployment.rst

   .. include:: /includes/steps-connect-deployment.rst

You can manage the following deployment settings.

.. _org-sharing-deployment:

Enable Organization-Wide Sharing for a Deployment
-------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-org-wide-sharing.rst

Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Check that you can access the |service| UI for the organization that contains
  your |service| project.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-org-ui-access.rst

- If you enable organization-wide sharing for a deployment, it applies
  to all existing data sources and to any new data source you add to 
  that deployment in the future.

To enable organization-wide sharing for a deployment:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/steps-access-deployment.rst

   .. step:: Turn on organization-wide sharing.
    
      In the :guilabel:`Organization` subsection of the 
      :guilabel:`Data Access` section, toggle 
      :guilabel:`All users in the organization can view data in this data source` to :guilabel:`ON`.

Deployment Read Preference
--------------------------

Each :ref:`deployment <deployments>` has a read preference, which
determines the :manual:`replica set member </core/replica-set-members>`
that the data source reads data from. 

By default, a newly-added |service| {+cluster+} has a read 
preference of :guilabel:`Secondary`, which means that it reads from a
:manual:`secondary node </core/replica-set-secondary>`
within the |service| {+cluster+}. You can change the read preference of
a {+cluster+} using the :guilabel:`Read preference` dropdown. 

You can't change the read preference of a
{+fdi+}. {+Fdis+} have a read preference
of :guilabel:`Nearest` by default, which means that they read from the
replica set member whose network latency falls
within the acceptable latency window. To learn more, see
:manual:`Read Preference Modes </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-nearest>`.

The :guilabel:`Read preference` dropdown contains the following read
preference options for {+clusters+}:

   * - Analytics Node
     - Reads from an :ref:`analytics node <analytics-nodes-overview>`.
