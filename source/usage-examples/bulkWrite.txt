Perform Bulk Operations
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can perform bulk write operations on a collection by using the
``BulkWrite()`` method.

Example
-------

.. include:: /includes/usage-examples/run-example-tip.rst

The following example performs the following in order on the ``haikus``
collection:

- Matches a document in which the ``title`` is "Record of a Shriveled Datum" and replace it with a new document
- Matches a document in which the ``title`` is "Dodging Greys" and updates that value to "Dodge The Greys"

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/bulk.go
   :start-after: begin bulk
   :end-before: end bulk
   :emphasize-lines: 10
   :language: go
   :dedent:

Expected Result
---------------

After you run the full example, you can find the following document
in the ``haikus`` collection:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("..."),
      "title" : "Dodge The Greys",
      "text" : "When there're no matches, no longer need to panic. You can use upsert."
   }

For an example on how to find a document, see :ref:`golang-find-one`.
