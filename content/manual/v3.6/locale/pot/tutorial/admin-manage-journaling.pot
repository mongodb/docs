msgid "The WiredTiger storage engine does not require journaling to guarantee a consistent state after a crash. The database will be restored to the last consistent :ref:`checkpoint <storage-wiredtiger-checkpoints>` during recovery.  However, if MongoDB exits unexpectedly in between checkpoints, journaling is required to recover writes that occurred after the last checkpoint."

msgid "With journaling enabled, if :program:`mongod` stops unexpectedly, the program can recover everything written to the journal. MongoDB will re-apply the write operations on restart and maintain a consistent state. By default, the greatest extent of lost writes, i.e., those not made to the journal, are those made in the last 100 milliseconds, plus the time it takes to perform the actual journal writes. See :setting:`~storage.journal.commitIntervalMs` for more information on the default."
