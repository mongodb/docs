========================
|backup| Agent Changelog
========================

Backup Agent ``v20130826.0``
----------------------------

- Adds support for managing excluded namespaces: Backup Agent will no
  longer send data for excluded collections or databases.

Backup Agent ``v20130812.1``
----------------------------

*Major stability update*

- If the communication between the Backup Agent and the |backup| API
  is interrupted, the Backup Agent can more reliably recover the
  current state. This results in fewer "resync required" errors.
