   POST /api/atlas/v1.0/groups/GROUP-ID/clusters

Request Path Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 10 75

   * - Path Element
     - Required/Optional
     - Description

   * - ``GROUP-ID``

     - Required.

     - The unique identifier for the :ref:`group <group-id>` in which to
       create the cluster.

Request Body Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 10 10 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Required/Optional
     - Description

   * - ``name``
     - string
     - Required
     - The name of the cluster as it appears in |service|. Once the cluster is
       created, its name cannot be changed.

   * - ``numShards``
     - integer
     - Optional
     - Selects whether the cluster is a :term:`replica set` or a
       :term:`sharded cluster`.

       If this is set to ``1``, the cluster is a replica set. For more
       information on MongoDB replica sets, see :manual:`Replication
       </replication>` in the MongoDB manual.

       If this is set to ``2`` or higher, the cluster is a sharded cluster
       with the number of shards specified. For more information on sharded
       clusters, see :manual:`Sharding </sharding>` in the MongoDB manual.

       For details on how this setting affects costs, see
       :ref:`server-number-costs`.

       The possible values are ``1`` through ``12``.

       The default value is ``1``.

   * - ``replicationFactor``
     - number
     - Optional
     - The number of :term:`replica set` members. Each member keeps a copy of
       your databases, providing high availability and data redundancy.

       If your cluster is a sharded cluster, each shard is a replica set with
       the specified replication factor.

       For information on how the replication factor affects costs, see
       :ref:`server-number-costs`. For more information on MongoDB replica
       sets, see :manual:`Replication </replication>` in the MongoDB manual.

       The possible values are ``3``, ``5``, or ``7``.

       The default value is ``3``.

   * - ``providerSettings``
     - object
     - Required
     - The configuration for the provisioned servers on which MongoDB runs.
       The available options are specific to the cloud service provider.

   * - ``providerSettings.providerName``
     - string
     - Required
     - The cloud service provider on which the servers are provisioned.

       |service| currently integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS). This
       field must be set to ``AWS`` until other integrations become available.

   * - ``providerSettings.regionName``
     - string
     - Required
     - The physical location of your MongoDB cluster. The region you choose
       can affect network latency for clients accessing your databases.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-group-region-association.rst

       For ``AWS``, |service| currently uses the following values. |service|
       might also offer additional values in the future.

       - ``AP_SOUTHEAST_2``
       - ``EU_WEST_1``
       - ``US_EAST_1``
       - ``US_WEST_2``

   * - ``providerSettings.instanceSizeName``
     - string
     - Required
     - |service| provides different instance sizes, each with a default RAM
       size, storage capacity, and maximum storage speed. The instance size
       you select is used for all the data-bearing servers in your cluster.
       For definitions of data-bearing servers, see
       :ref:`server-number-costs`.

       You can customize the instance size using the ``diskSizeGB`` and
       ``providerSettings.diskIOPS`` fields. Doing so affects costs, as
       described in :doc:`/billing`.

       In the API, enter the instance size exactly as it is named in the
       interface. For example, for :guilabel:`M40` enter ``M40``.

       To view available instance sizes: open the |service| web interface;
       view an existing configuration or click the button to add a new one;
       view the available instance sizes; close the window without saving
       changes.

   * - ``providerSettings.diskIOPS``
     - integer
     - Optional
     - The maximum input/output operations per second (IOPS) the system can
       perform. The available IOPS depend on the instance size: each instance
       size has a specific set of available IOPS values. To view available
       values, use the |service| interface to either view an existing
       configuration or add a new one; then click an instance size to view the
       available values; and then close the configuration without saving
       changes.

       The default value for ``providerSettings.diskIOPS`` is the same as the
       instance size's :guilabel:`Standard IOPS` value, as viewable in the
       |service| interface.

   * - ``providerSettings.encryptEBSVolume``
     - Boolean
     - Optional
     - *AWS only*. If enabled, the Amazon EBS encryption feature encrypts the
       server's root volume for both data at rest within the volume and for
       data moving between the volume and the instance.

       The default value is ``false``.

   * - ``diskSizeGB``
     - double
     - Optional
     - The size in gigabytes of the server's root volume. You can add capacity
       by increasing this number, up to a maximum possible value of ``16384``
       (i.e., 16 TB).

       Each instance size has its own default value. If you set a value below
       the instance default, |service| replaces it with the default value.
       To view default values: open the |service| web interface; click the
       button to add a new cluster; view the available default sizes; close
       the window without saving changes.

       .. important:: |service| calculates storage charges differently
          depending on whether you choose the default value or a custom value.
          For details, see :ref:`storage-capacity`.

   * - ``backupEnabled``
     - Boolean
     - Required
     - If enabled, the |service| :doc:`Backup </backup-cluster>` service takes
       snapshots of your databases at regular intervals and retains them
       according to your group's :ref:`retention policy <retention-policy>`.
