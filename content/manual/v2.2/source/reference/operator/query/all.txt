.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol

.. query:: $all

   *Syntax*: ``{ field: { $all: [ <value> , <value1> ... ] }``

   :query:`$all` selects the documents where the ``field`` holds an
   array and contains all elements (e.g. ``<value>``, ``<value1>``, etc.)
   in the array.

   Consider the following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.inventory.find( { tags: { $all: [ "appliances", "school", "book" ] } } )

   This query selects all documents in the ``inventory`` collection
   where the ``tags`` field contains an array with the elements,
   ``appliances``, ``school``, and ``book``.

   Therefore, the above query will match documents in the ``inventory``
   collection that have a ``tags`` field that hold *either* of the
   following arrays:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      [ "school", "book", "bag", "headphone", "appliances" ]
      [ "appliances", "school", "book" ]

   The :query:`$all` operator exists to describe and specify arrays
   in MongoDB queries. However, you may use the :query:`$all`
   operator to select against a non-array ``field``, as in the
   following example:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.inventory.find( { qty: { $all: [ 50 ] } } )

   **However**, use the following form to express the same query:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.inventory.find( { qty: 50 } )

   Both queries will select all documents in the ``inventory``
   collection where the value of the ``qty`` field equals ``50``.

   .. note::

      In most cases, MongoDB does not treat arrays as sets. This
      operator provides a notable exception to this approach.

      In the current release queries that use the :query:`$all`
      operator must scan all the documents that match the first element in
      the query array. As a result, even with an index to support the
      query, the operation may be long running, particularly when the
      first element in the array is not very selective.

   .. seealso::
      :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>`, :method:`update()
      <db.collection.update()>`, and :update:`$set`.
