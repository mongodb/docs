You can use :ref:`zone sharding <zone-sharding>` to distribute
collections across a sharded cluster and designate which shards store
data for each collection. You can distribute collections based on shard
properties, such as physical resources and available memory, to ensure
that each collection is stored on the optimal shard for that data.

Prerequisites
-------------

To complete this tutorial, you must:

- :ref:`Deploy a sharded cluster <sharding-procedure-setup>`. This
  tutorial uses a sharded cluster with three shards.

- Connect to a :program:`mongos`. You cannot create zones or zone ranges
  by connecting directly to a shard.

- Authenticate as a user with at least the :authrole:`clusterManager`
  role on the ``admin`` database. To view user permissions, use the
  :method:`db.getUser()` method.

Scenario
--------

You have a database called ``shardDistributionDB`` that contains two
sharded collections:

- ``bigData``, which contains a large amount of data.

- ``manyIndexes``, which contains many large indexes.

You want to limit each collection to a subset of shards so that each
collection can use the shards' different physical resources.

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sharded cluster has three shards. Each shard has unique physical
resources:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 8 20

   * - Shard Name
     - Physical Resources

   * - ``shard0``
     - High memory capacity

   * - ``shard1``
     - Fast flash storage

   * - ``shard2``
     - High memory capacity **and** fast flash storage

Zones
~~~~~

To distribute collections based on physical resources, use shard zones.
A shard zone associates collections with a specific subset of shards,
which restricts the shards that store the collection's data. In this
example, you need two shard zones:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 15 20

   * - Zone Name
     - Description
     - Collections in this Zone

   * - ``HI_RAM``
     - Servers with high memory capacity.
     - Collections requiring more memory, such as collections with large
       indexes, should be on the ``HI_RAM`` shards.

   * - ``FLASH``
     - Servers with flash drives for fast storage speeds.
     - Large collections requiring fast data retrieval should be on the
       ``FLASH`` shards.

Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~

In this tutorial, the :ref:`shard key <shard-key>` you will use to shard
each collection is ``{ _id: "hashed" }``. You will configure shard zones
**before** you shard the collections. As a result, each collection's
data only ever exists on the shards in the corresponding zone.

With :ref:`hashed sharding <index-type-hashed>`, if you shard
collections before you configure zones, MongoDB assigns :term:`chunks
<chunk>` evenly between all shards when sharding is enabled. This means
that chunks may be temporarily assigned to a shard poorly suited to
handle that chunk's data.

Balancer
~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` migrates chunks to the
appropriate shard, respecting any configured zones. When balancing is
complete, shards only contain chunks whose ranges match its assigned
zones.

.. important:: Performance
   
   Adding, removing, or changing zones or zone ranges can result in
   chunk migrations. Depending on the size of your dataset and the
   number of chunks a zone or zone range affects, these migrations may
   impact cluster performance. Consider running the balancer during
   specific scheduled windows. To learn how to set a scheduling window,
   see :ref:`sharding-schedule-balancing-window`.

Steps
-----

Use the following procedure to configure shard zones and distribute
collections based on shard physical resources.

.. procedure::
   
   .. step:: Add each shard to the appropriate zone.

      To configure the shards in each zone, use the
      :dbcommand:`addShardToZone` command.

      Add ``shard0`` and ``shard2`` to the ``HI_RAM`` zone:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.addShardToZone("shard0", "HI_RAM")

         sh.addShardToZone("shard2", "HI_RAM")

      Add ``shard1`` and ``shard2`` to the ``FLASH`` zone:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.addShardToZone("shard1", "FLASH")
         
         sh.addShardToZone("shard2", "FLASH")

   .. step:: Add zone ranges for the relevant collections.
      
      To associate a range of
      shard keys to a zone, use :method:`sh.updateZoneKeyRange()`. 

      In this scenario, you want to associate all documents in a
      collection to the appropriate zone. To associate all collection
      documents to a zone, specify the following zone range:

      - a lower bound of ``{ "_id" : MinKey }``
      - an upper bound of ``{ "_id" : MaxKey }``

      For the ``bigData`` collection, set:
      
      - The namespace to ``shardDistributionDB.bigData``,
      - The lower bound to :bsontype:`MinKey`,
      - The upper bound to :bsontype:`MaxKey`, 
      - The zone to ``FLASH``

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.updateZoneKeyRange(
            "shardDistributionDB.bigData",
            { "_id" : MinKey },
            { "_id" : MaxKey },
            "FLASH"
         )

      For the ``manyIndexes`` collection, set:
      
      - The namespace to ``shardDistributionDB.manyIndexes``,
      - The lower bound to :bsontype:`MinKey`,
      - The upper bound to :bsontype:`MaxKey`, 
      - The zone to ``HI_RAM``

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.updateZoneKeyRange(
            "shardDistributionDB.manyIndexes",
            { "_id" : MinKey },
            { "_id" : MaxKey },
            "HI_RAM"
         )

   .. step:: Shard the collections.

      To shard both collections (``bigData`` and ``manyIndexes``),
      specify a :ref:`shard key <shard-key>` of ``{ _id: "hashed" }``.

      Run the following commands:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.shardCollection(
            "shardDistributionDB.bigData", { _id: "hashed" }
         )

         sh.shardCollection(
            "shardDistributionDB.manyIndexes", { _id: "hashed" }
         )
      
   .. step:: Review the changes.

      To view chunk distribution and shard zones, use the
      :method:`sh.status()` method:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         sh.status()

      The next time the :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` runs, it
      splits chunks where necessary and migrates chunks across the
      shards, respecting the configured zones. The amount of time the
      balancer takes to complete depends on several factors, including
      number of shards, available memory, and
      :abbr:`IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)`.

      When balancing finishes:
      
      - Chunks for documents in the ``manyIndexes`` collection reside on
        ``shard0`` and ``shard2``
        
      - Chunks for documents in the ``bigData`` collection reside on
        ``shard1`` and ``shard2``.
