   :description: fsyncUnlock reduces the lock count on the server or cluster.

Definition
----------

.. dbcommand:: fsyncUnlock

   Reduces the lock count on the server or cluster. To enable write operations,
   the lock count must be zero.

   .. |fsyncLockUnlock| replace:: the :dbcommand:`fsync` and
      ``fsyncUnlock`` commands
   .. include:: /includes/fsync-mongos

   Use this command to unblock writes after you finish a backup operation.

   .. include:: /includes/fsync-lock-command

   :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` is an administrative operation. Typically
   you will use :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` following a database
   :doc:`backup operation </core/backups>`.

   .. |method| replace:: :method:`db.fsyncUnlock` helper method
   .. include:: /includes/fact-dbcommand-tip

Compatibility
-------------

This command is available in deployments hosted in the following environments: 

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

Syntax
------

The command has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand(
      {
        fsyncUnlock: 1,
        comment: <any>
      }
   )

The ``comment`` field is optional and may contain a comment of any data
type.

Results
-------

The operation returns a document with the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``info``
     - Information on the status of the operation

   * - ``lockCount`` 
     - The number of locks remaining on the instance after the operation.

   * - ``ok``
     - The status code.

Examples
--------

Consider a situation where :method:`db.fsyncLock()` has been issued two
times. The following :dbcommand:`fsyncUnlock` operation reduces the
locks taken by :method:`db.fsyncLock()` by 1:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { fsyncUnlock: 1 } )

The operation returns the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "info" : "fsyncUnlock completed", "lockCount" : NumberLong(1), "ok" : 1 }

As the ``lockCount`` is greater than 0, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance
is locked against writes. To unlock the instance for writes, run the
unlock operation again:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.adminCommand( { fsyncUnlock: 1 } )

The operation returns the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "info" : "fsyncUnlock completed", "lockCount" : NumberLong(0), "ok" : 1 }

The :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance is unlocked for writes.
