:term:`GridFS` is a specification for storing and retrieving files that
exceed the :term:`BSON`-document :ref:`size limit
<limit-bson-document-size>` of 16MB.

Instead of storing a file in an single document, GridFS divides a file
into chunks and stores each of those chunks as a separate document. By
default GridFS limits chunk size to 256k. GridFS uses two collections to
store files. One collection stores the file chunks, and the other stores
file metadata.

When you query for a file stored through GridFS, GridFS sends the chunks
as a data stream. You can perform range queries on files stored through GridFS.
You also can access information from random sections of files, for
example skipping into the middle of a video.

GridFS is useful not only for storing files that exceed 16MB but also
for storing any files for which you want access without having to load the
entire file into memory. For more information on when to use GridFS, see
:ref:`faq-developers-when-to-use-gridfs`.

Implement GridFS
----------------

To store and retrieve files using :term:`GridFS`, use either of the following:

- A MongoDB driver. See the :doc:`drivers</applications/drivers>`
  documentation for information on using GridFS with your driver.

- The :program:`mongofiles` command-line tool in the :program:`mongo`
  shell. See :doc:`/reference/mongofiles`.

.. _gridfs-collections:

GridFS Collections
------------------

:term:`GridFS` stores files in two collections but makes it appear you
have created a single collection.

Under the hood, GridFS uses two collections to store files:

- ``chunks`` stores the binary chunks. For details, see
  :ref:`gridfs-chunks-collection`.

- ``files`` stores the file's metadata. For details, see
  :ref:`gridfs-files-collection`.

GridFS places the collections in a common bucket by prefixing each with
the bucket name. By default, GridFS stores the collections in the ``fs``
bucket:

- ``fs.files``
- ``fs.chunks``

You can rename the ``fs`` bucket, as well as create additional buckets.

GridFS uses the bucket name to make it appear that you have created a
single collection. When you access the files, you use the bucket name as
though it were the name of the collection.

For example, if you use GridFS to create a ``photos`` collection, GridFS
actually creates these two collections:

- ``photos.files``
- ``photos.chunks``

If you save a new 20 MB photo into the ``photos`` collection, GridFS
records metadata about the photo in ``photos.files`` and divides the
photo's binary data into chunks for storage in the ``photos.chunks``
collection.

.. index:: GridFS; chunks collection
.. _gridfs-chunks-collection:

The chunks Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each document in the ``chunks`` collection represents a different chunk
of a document that has been parsed by :term:`GridFS`. The following is a
prototype document from the ``chunks`` collection.:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : <string>,
     "files_id" : <string>,
     "n" : <num>,
     "data" : <binary>
   }

A document from the ``chunks`` collection contains the following fields:

.. data:: chunks._id

   The unique :term:`ObjectID` of the chunk.

.. data:: chunks.files_id

   The ``_id`` of the "parent" document, as specified in the ``files``
   collection.

.. data:: chunks.n

   The sequential number of the chunk. Chunks are numbered in order,
   starting with 0.

.. data:: chunks.data

   The chunk's payload as a :term:`BSON` binary type.

The ``chunks`` collection uses a :term:`compound index` on ``files_id`` and
``n``, as described in :ref:`gridfs-index`.

.. index:: GridFS; files collection
.. _gridfs-files-collection:

The files Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each document in the ``files`` collection represents a
document that has been stored by :term:`GridFS`. The following is a
prototype of a ``files`` collection document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : <ObjectID>,
     "length" : <num>,
     "chunkSize" : <num>
     "uploadDate" : <timestamp>
     "md5" : <hash>

     "filename" : <string>,
     "contentType" : <string>,
     "aliases" : <string array>,
     "metadata" : <dataObject>,
   }

A document from the ``files`` collection contains some or all of the
following fields. You can create additional fields:

.. data:: files._id

   The unique ID for this document. The ``_id`` is of the data type you
   chose for the original document. The default type for MongoDB
   documents is :term:`BSON` :term:`ObjectID`.

.. data:: files.length

   The size of the document in bytes.

.. data:: files.chunkSize

   The size of each chunk. GridFS divides the document into chunks of
   the size specified here. The default size is 256k.

.. data:: files.uploadDate

   The date the document was first stored by GridFS.

.. data:: files.md5

   An MD5 hash returned from the filemd5 api.

.. data:: files.filename

   A human-readable name for the document. This field is optional.

.. data:: files.contentType

   A valid MIME type for the document. This field is optional.

.. data:: files.aliases

   An array of alias strings. This field is optional.

.. data:: files.metadata

   Any additional information you want to store. This field is optional.

.. index:: GridFS; index
.. _gridfs-index:

GridFS Index
------------

:term:`GridFS` uses a :term:`unique <unique index>`, :term:`compound
<compound index>` index on the ``chunks`` collection for ``files_id``
and ``n``. The index allows efficient retrieval of chunks using the
``files_id`` and ``n`` values, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   cursor = db.fs.chunks.find({files_id: myFileID}).sort({n:1});

See the :doc:`/applications/drivers` documentation for your driver to
learn whether this index is created by default.

The following command creates this index from the shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.fs.chunks.ensureIndex({files_id:1, n:1}, {unique: true});

Example Interface
-----------------

The following is an example of the GridFS interface in Java. The example
is for demonstration purposes only. For API specifics, see the
:doc:`/applications/drivers` documentation for your driver.

.. code-block:: java

   /*
    * default root collection usage - must be supported
    */
   GridFS myFS = new GridFS(myDatabase);            // returns a default GridFS (e.g. "fs" bucket collection)
   myFS.storeFile(new File("/tmp/largething.mpg")); // saves the file into the "fs" GridFS store

   /*
    * specified root collection usage - optional
    */

   GridFS myContracts = new GridFS(myDatabase, "contracts");            // returns a GridFS where  "contracts" is root
   myFS.retrieveFile("smithco", new File("/tmp/smithco_20090105.pdf")); // retrieves object whose filename is "smithco"
