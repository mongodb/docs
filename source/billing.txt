.. _billing-overview:

Billing settings are configured at the organization level and apply to
all projects within that organization. You can examine costs at the
organization level or the project level.

To configure the payment method and billing profile for an
organization, or to view the most recent and pending charges for
an organization, access the organization's :guilabel:`Billing` section
through |service|.

|service|:

- charges by the hour for your MongoDB {+clusters+}
- charges for usage of your MongoDB {+serverless-instances+}
- tabulates costs daily
- displays your current monthly costs on the
  :ref:`Invoices page <view-current-invoice>`

To view line-item charges,
:ref:`view all of your invoices <view-past-invoices>`.

As you configure a {+database-deployment+}, you can view the total 
cost, except for data transfer, before applying your settings.

.. _atlas-billing-methods:

Payment Method
--------------

To pay for your |service| usage, you can:

- Pay with an
  :ref:`accepted payment method <payment-alternatives>`.
- Pay with a MongoDB |service|
  :ref:`subscription <atlas-subscriptions>`.

.. note::

   Contact :website:`MongoDB Sales </contact/atlas>` to:

   - Purchase a subscription. Your
     :ref:`subscription level <subscription-level>` determines your
     access to support and other entitlements.

   - Review alternative billing methods.

.. important::
   
   To confirm your credit card information, |service| charges $1.00 
   when you first connect a credit card to your account. After 
   |service| confirms your information, it refunds the $1.00 charge. If 
   you encounter any issues with connecting a credit card to your 
   account, reach out to your card provider or banking institution. 
   Verify whether they declined the initial charge, which would prevent 
   |service| from confirming your information.

service to view charges incurred by a particular |service| service.

|service| services include:

- {+Clusters+}
- {+Serverless-instances+}
- |charts|

projects. {+Deployments+} are {+clusters+} and {+serverless-instances+}.

You can filter the chart by project to view charges incurred by 
{+deployments+} in a particular project.

.. _cross-org-billing:

Cross-Organization Billing
--------------------------

*Cross-organization billing* is an |service| subscription feature that 
enables you to share a billing subscription across multiple 
:doc:`organizations </tutorial/manage-organizations/>` and to pay a 
single invoice for them. After 
:ref:`configuring a paying organization <configure-paying-org>`, you 
pay invoices for the paying organization that include a list of charges 
incurred for all linked organizations.

A paying organization's :guilabel:`Invoices` tab includes the following 
information for each invoice:

- the :guilabel:`Org Total` of the paying organization's charges, 
  and

- the :guilabel:`Cross Org Total` of the paying and linked 
  organizations' combined charges.

Expand a paying organization invoice item to display its linked 
organizations and their contributions to the 
:guilabel:`Cross Org Total`.

.. figure:: /images/paying-org-invoice.png
   :alt: The paying organization invoice shows costs incurred for that 
         organization and a list of costs for linked organizations
   :figwidth: 100%

Linked organizations are subject to the subscription agreement of the 
paying organization, including the level of support, the charges 
associated with the subscription, discounts, and payment terms.

Linked Organization Invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You pay for all linked organization usage through the paying 
organization. However, each linked organization still produces a 
monthly invoice to help you account for usage.

Linked organization invoices include all charges incurred by that 
organization, as well as a percentage of your total cross-organization 
billing subscription cost proportional to that organization's usage.

Each day, |service| bills linked and paying organizations for
subscription uplift based on their own usage.

At the end of a paying organization's billing period, |service| bills
linked and paying organizations proportionally to their usage for the unmet 
monthly minimum, if there is one.

.. example::
   A paying organization has an |service| Pro subscription and two 
   linked organizations. The paying organization incurs no charges. 
   
   Linked organization #1 incurs $400 in subscription uplift charges 
   while linked organization #2 incurs $200 in subscription uplift 
   charges. The paying organization has a monthly minimum of $799, so 
   at the end of the month, the unmet $199 is proportionally distributed 
   across invoices for linked organizations #1 and #2:

   - |service| charges linked organization #1 $132.70 of the unmet $199 
     because it incurred 2/3 of the total charges.

   - |service| charges linked organization #2 $66.30 of the unmet $199 
     because it incurred 1/3 of the total charges.

   You still pay all charges through the paying organization.

.. note::
   
   At the end of the paying organization's billing period, simultaneous 
   charges for daily subscription uplift and an unmet minimum could 
   trigger daily maximum billing alerts.

.. _cross-org-billing-use-cases:

Use Cases
~~~~~~~~~

Cross-organization billing can be useful for establishing broad levels 
of authorization using |service| organizations, and for exceeding the 
250-project limit on |service| organizations.

.. example::

   A company with sales and engineering teams might need 
   significantly different organization-level authorization for each, 
   but still want to receive a single invoice for the company's 
   database use. That company could create and link sales and 
   engineering organizations to a paying organization to pay all costs 
   through that paying organization, while maintaining control over the 
   authorizations of each team organization.

   A company with over 250 projects might create new organizations for 
   new projects, then link them all to a paying organization to 
   maintain a single source of invoicing.

.. _configure-paying-org:

Configure a Paying Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prerequisites and Limitations
`````````````````````````````

- To link a paying organization to another organization, you must have 
  :authrole:`Organization Billing Admin` or :authrole:`Organization Owner`
  privileges for both organizations.

- A paying organization and any linked organizations
  must be on the same subscription plan.

- A paying organization and any linked organizations
  must have the same minimums, uplifts, and SLA for their 
  subscription plan.

- A paying organization and any linked organizations
  cannot have overlapping monthly commitment deals.

organizations. To link additional organizations, click 
:guilabel:`Link More Organizations`.

Billing Quota Management
------------------------

You can use :ref:`billing alerts <billing-alerts>` to help manage your
billing quotas. Billing alerts notify a designated person when a bill
has exceeded a |usd| limit, or when a credit card is about to expire.

To :ref:`configure billing alerts <configure-alert-settings-tabs>`,
click Organization :guilabel:`Alerts` in the :guilabel:`Organization`
view.
