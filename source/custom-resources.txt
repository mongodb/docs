Managing |ak8so| with ``kubectl``
-----------------------------------

To list all |ak8so| resources in your cluster with ``kubectl``, you can run:

.. code-block:: sh

   kubectl get atlas

For your convenience, to list or describe specific types of |ak8so| CRDs, 
you can use the short names listed in the above table. For example, to list all
``atlasdatabaseusers`` in the ``mongodb`` namespace, you can run:

.. code-block:: sh

   kubectl get adu -n mongodb

|ak8so| Workflow
----------------

When you use |ak8so|, you can create a new |service| project, or you 
can work with an existing |service| project.

.. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-api-key-permission.rst

To learn more, see :ref:`ak8so-access-to-atlas-ref`.

.. _ak8so-create-update-process:

Create and Update Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each time you change the ``spec`` field in any of the supported 
custom resources, the following workflow begins in |ak8so|:

1. |ak8so| receives an event about the changed custom resource.

#. |ak8so| updates the ``status.conditions`` field to reflect that the 
   resource is not ready:

   .. code-block:: sh
      
      conditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: "2021-03-13T16:26:17Z"
        status: "False"
        type: Ready

#. .. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-orgid-api-key-locations.rst

#. .. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-connection-information.rst

#. .. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-connection-errors.rst

#. If the update succeeds, ``status.conditions`` reflects that the 
   resource is ready:

   .. code-block:: sh
    
      conditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: "2021-03-13T16:26:17Z"
        status: "True"
        type: Ready

.. _ak8so-delete-process:

Delete Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of |ak8so| 2.0, when you delete a custom resource from |k8s|, the object
stays in |service| by default but |ak8so| 
:ref:`no longer controls the object <deletion-protection>`. You can 
:ref:`revert this default for your entire deployment <revert-deletion-protection>`, 
or override this default for a specific custom resource with an 
:ref:`annotation <ak8so-annotations>` to allow |ak8so| to delete the 
corresponding object from |service|. If you override with an annotation,
the following workflow begins:

1. |ak8so| receives an event about the deleted custom resource.

#. To connect to the {+atlas-admin-api+}, |ak8so| reads the 
   organization ID 
   and |api| keys from one of the following locations:

   - :setting:`spec.connectionSecretRef.name` (if specified in 
     the :ref:`atlasproject-custom-resource`).

     .. include:: /includes/fact-ak8so-connection-secret-namespace.rst

   - ``global`` |ak8so| |k8s-secret| 
     ``<operator-deployment-name>-api-key`` 
     (if :setting:`spec.connectionSecretRef.name` is not specified).

#. To delete the resource from |service|, |ak8so| uses the connection 
   information to make |api| calls to |service|. 
  
   .. note::

      |ak8so| removes any related objects created in |k8s|. For 
      example, if you remove ``AtlasDatabaseUser``, |ak8so| removes the 
      related connection |k8s-secrets|.

.. _ak8so-annotations:

Use Annotations to Skip or Override Defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use annotations to modify the :ref:`new default behaviour <deletion-protection>` 
of |ak8so|. 

* If you add the ``mongodb.com/atlas-resource-policy: "delete"`` annotation 
  to a custom resource's ``metadata``, |ak8so| deletes the corresponding object in |service|
  when you delete the |ak8so| resource.

  **Example**

  .. code-block:: yaml

     apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
     kind: AtlasProject
     metadata:
       name: my-project
       annotations:
         mongodb.com/atlas-resource-policy: "delete"

* If you have :ref:`reverted the new delete behavior <revert-deletion-protection>` 
  to the default used prior to |ak8so| 2.0, you can add the 
  ``mongodb.com/atlas-resource-policy: "keep"`` annotation 
  to a custom resource's ``metadata`` so |ak8so| won't delete the 
  resource when you delete the |ak8so| resource. 

* If you add the ``mongodb.com/atlas-reconciliation-policy: "skip"`` 
  annotation to a custom resource's ``metadata``, |ak8so| doesn't start 
  the reconciliation for the resource. This annotation lets you pause the 
  sync with the spec until you remove the annotation. You can use this 
  annotation to make manual changes to a custom resource and avoid
  |ak8so| undoing them during a sync. When you remove this annotation, 
  |ak8so| reconciles the resource and syncs it with the spec.

* If you add the ``mongodb.com/atlas-resource-version-policy: "allow"``
  annotation to a custom resource's ``metadata``, |ak8so| lets you use a 
  resource even if its version label doesn't match the version of 
  |ak8so| that you are using. If your resource version is a major version 
  behind your |ak8so| version, the latest features might not work. Minor 
  version discrepancies are backward-compatible.
