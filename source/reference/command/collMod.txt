.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. dbcommand:: collMod

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   :dbcommand:`collMod` makes it possible to add flags to a collection
   to modify the behavior of MongoDB. In the current release the only
   available flag is :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes`. The command takes the
   following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.runCommand( {"collMod" : <collection> , "<flag>" : <value> } )

   In this command substitute ``<collection>`` with the name of a
   collection in the current database, and ``<flag>`` and ``<value>``
   with the flag and value you want to set.

   .. index:: document; space allocation
   .. index:: usePowerOf2Sizes
   .. _usePowerOf2Sizes:
   .. collflag:: usePowerOf2Sizes

      The :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` flag changes the method that
      MongoDB uses to allocate space on disk for documents in this
      collection. By setting :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes`, you ensure
      that MongoDB will allocate space for documents in sizes that
      are powers of 2 (e.g. 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512...8388608).
      With :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` MongoDB will be able to more
      effectively reuse space.

      .. note::

         With :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` MongoDB, allocates
         records that have power of 2 sizes, until record sizes
         equal 4 megabytes. For records larger than 4 megabytes
         with :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` set, :program:`mongod`
         will allocate records in full megabytes by rounding up to
         the nearest megabyte.

      :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` is useful for collections where you
      will be inserting and deleting large numbers of documents to
      ensure that MongoDB will effectively use space on disk.

      .. example::

         To enable :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` on the collection
         named ``products``, use the following operation:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            db.runCommand( {collMod: "products", usePowerOf2Sizes : true })

         To disable :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` on the collection
         ``products``, use the following operation:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            db.runCommand( { collMod: "products", "usePowerOf2Sizes": false })


      .. warning::
         .. versionchanged:: 2.2.1
            :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` now
            supports documents larger than 8 megabytes. If you enable
            :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` you **must** use at least
            version 2.2.1.

         :collflag:`usePowerOf2Sizes` only affects subsequent
         allocations caused by document insertion or record relocation
         as a result of document growth, and *does not* affect
         existing allocations.

         .. Commenting out the following after DOCS-717, it does take
            a lock but its to cover a very small metadata change.

            This command obtains a write lock on the affected database
            and will block other operations until it has completed.
