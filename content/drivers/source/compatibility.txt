Driver Compatibility Tables
===========================

.. meta::
   :description: Explore compatibility tables for MongoDB drivers, detailing server, language, and component compatibility to ensure operational environments.
   :keywords: backwards compatibility, versions, upgrade

.. facet::
   :name: genre
   :values: reference

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 2
   :class: singlecol

The compatibility tables on this page show compatibility between different versions of
the driver, {+mdb-server+}, and the driver language or framework. You can use these
tables to ensure your environment remains operational after an upgrade.

.. note:: Minor Version Compatibility

   If a driver is compatible with a major version of {+mdb-server+}, it is also compatible
   with the minor and patch releases within that major version unless otherwise specified.

      Python Compatibility
      --------------------

      PyMongo supports both CPython and PyPy.

      When a version of Python is marked end-of-life (EOL), the next minor release of
      PyMongo drops support for that version. The driver offers the
      following ongoing support for EOL Python versions:

      - **CPython**: The last minor PyMongo version compatible with the EOL CPython
        version receives critical bug fixes for one year.

      - **PyPy**: PyMongo doesn't support PyPy versions past their EOL date.
