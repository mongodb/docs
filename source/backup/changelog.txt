|backup| Agent Changelog
========================

Backup Agent ``v20130923.0``
----------------------------

- When the agent sends the initial meta-data about the data to back up
  (e.g. the list of databases, collections,and indexes,) to the MMS
  API, the agent will not include any databases or collections in the
  "excluded namespace" configuration.

Backup Agent ``v20130826.0``
----------------------------

- Adds support for managing excluded namespaces: Backup Agent will no
  longer send data for excluded collections or databases.

Backup Agent ``v20130812.1``
----------------------------

*Major stability update*

- If the communication between the Backup Agent and the |backup| API
  is interrupted, the Backup Agent can more reliably recover the
  current state. This results in fewer "resync required" errors.
