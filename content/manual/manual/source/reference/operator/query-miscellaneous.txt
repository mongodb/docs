   * - Name
     - Description
   * - :query:`$rand`
     - Returns a pseudo-random floating point number in the interval [0,
       1). 0 included, 1 is excluded.
   * - :operator:`$natural`
     - A special hint that can be provided via the
       :method:`~cursor.sort()` or :method:`~cursor.hint()` methods that
       can be used to force either a forward or reverse collection scan.
       Use in conjunction with ``cursor.hint()`` to perform a collection
       scan to return documents in the natural order, which returns
       documents from a collection based on their physical order on disk
       rather than any logical order defined by an index.
