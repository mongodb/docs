title: "Run a |fts| diacritic-insensitive query."
content: |

  a. Create a file named ``DiacriticInsensitive.kt``.
  #. Copy and paste the following code into the ``DiacriticInsensitive.kt`` file.

     The code example performs the following tasks:

     - Imports ``mongodb`` packages and dependencies.
     - Establishes a connection to your cluster.
     - Uses the following ``compound`` operator clauses to query the collection: 

       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-diacritic-insensitive-constant-desc.rst 
       
       .. include:: /includes/fts/extracts/fts-diacritic-insensitive-stage.rst

     - Prints the documents that match the query from the
       ``AggregateFlow`` instance.

  #. .. include:: /includes/fts/facts/fact-fts-driver-connection-string.rst
  #. Run the ``DiacriticInsensitive.kt`` file.

     When you run the ``DiacriticInsensitive.kt`` program in your IDE, it prints
     the following documents:

     .. code-block:: none
        :copyable: false
