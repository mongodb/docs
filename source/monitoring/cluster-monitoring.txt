Overview
--------

This guide shows you how to use the {+php-library+} to monitor server
discovery and monitoring (SDAM) events in a MongoDB instance, replica
set, or sharded cluster. These events occur when there are any changes
in the state of the MongoDB instance or cluster that you are connected
to.

You might use information about SDAM events in your application to
understand cluster changes, assess cluster health, or perform capacity
planning.

.. _php-subscribe-sdam:

Subscribe to Events
-------------------

You can access details about SDAM events by subscribing to them
in your application. To subscribe to an event, create a class that
implements the ``MongoDB\Driver\Monitoring\SDAMSubscriber`` interface,
then use the ``MongoDB\Client::addSubscriber()`` method to register the
event subscriber with your ``MongoDB\Client`` instance.

The following code creates the ``MySubscriber`` class, which implements
the ``SDAMSubscriber`` interface. The class is defined with a method to
output a message when a ``ServerOpeningEvent`` is generated by the
server:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring/sdam.php
   :start-after: start-mysubscriber
   :end-before: end-mysubscriber
   :language: php
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

.. note::

   As shown in the preceding code, you must implement all the methods
   of the ``SDAMSubscriber`` interface, even for events you are not subscribing to.
   The example defines the extra methods as empty so that the
   application does not output any messages for those events.

Then, use the ``addSubscriber()`` method to register ``MySubscriber``
with the client, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring/sdam.php
   :start-after: start-add-sub
   :end-before: end-add-sub
   :language: php
   :copyable:
   :dedent:

When you run the application, your subscriber records the SDAM event and
outputs messages such as the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Server opening on ac-rmuag0v-shard-00-00.gh0qg50.mongodb.net:27017
   Server opening on ac-rmuag0v-shard-00-01.gh0qg50.mongodb.net:27017
   Server opening on ac-rmuag0v-shard-00-02.gh0qg50.mongodb.net:27017

Event Descriptions
------------------

You can subscribe to SDAM events by implementing the corresponding
method from the ``SDAMSubscriber`` interface. The following table
provides the name of each SDAM event, linked to the class's API
documentation, and a description of when the event is published:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 65 
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Event Type
     - Description

   * - :php:`ServerChangedEvent <mongodb-driver-monitoring-serverchangedevent>`
     - Created when the server description changes, such as the server's
       type changing from secondary to primary.

   * - :php:`ServerOpeningEvent <mongodb-driver-monitoring-serveropeningevent>`
     - Created when a new server is added to the topology.

   * - :php:`ServerClosedEvent <mongodb-driver-monitoring-serverclosedevent>`
     - Created when an existing server is removed from the topology.

   * - :php:`TopologyChangedEvent <mongodb-driver-monitoring-topologychangedevent>`
     - Created when the topology description changes, such as when there
       is an election of a new primary.

   * - :php:`TopologyOpeningEvent <mongodb-driver-monitoring-topologyopeningevent>`
     - Created when the driver first connects to the cluster.

   * - :php:`TopologyClosedEvent <mongodb-driver-monitoring-topologyclosedevent>`
     - Created when the driver disconnects from the cluster.

   * - :php:`ServerHeartbeatStartedEvent <mongodb-driver-monitoring-serverheartbeatstartedevent>`
     - Created when the server monitor sends a ``hello`` command to the server.
       This action is called a heartbeat.

   * - :php:`ServerHeartbeatSucceededEvent <mongodb-driver-monitoring-serverheartbeatsucceededevent>`
     - Created when the heartbeat succeeds.

   * - :php:`ServerHeartbeatFailedEvent <mongodb-driver-monitoring-serverheartbeatfailedevent>`
     - Created when the heartbeat fails.

You can find a list of the monitoring subscriber classes and event
methods in the :php:`Monitoring classes and subscriber functions
<mongodb.monitoring>` section of the PHP manual.

Remove a Subscriber
-------------------

Later in your application, you might not want to subscribe to
SDAM events. To unregister a subscriber from your client, use the
``MongoDB\Client::removeSubscriber()`` method. If you attempt to remove
a nonexistent subscriber, the method doesn't perform any action.

The following code shows how to remove the subscriber that you
registered in the :ref:`php-subscribe-sdam` section:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/monitoring/sdam.php
   :start-after: start-remove-sub
   :end-before: end-remove-sub
   :language: php
   :copyable:
   :dedent:
