Requirements
------------

For production deployments, you should maintain as much separation between
members as possible by hosting the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances on separate machines. When using virtual machines for
production deployments, you should place each :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instance on a separate host server serviced by redundant power circuits
and redundant network paths.

Before you can deploy a replica set, you must install MongoDB on
each system that will be part of your :term:`replica set`.
If you have not already installed MongoDB, see the :ref:`installation tutorials <tutorial-installation>`.

Before creating your replica set, you should verify that your network
configuration allows communication among all members; i.e. each member
must be able to connect to every other member. For instructions on how
to check your connection, see
:ref:`replica-set-troubleshooting-check-connection`.

To deploy a production replica set:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. begin-deployment-content

1. Start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance on each system that will be part
   of your replica set. Specify the same replica set name on each
   instance. For additional :binary:`~bin.mongod` configuration options
   specific to replica sets, see :ref:`cli-mongod-replica-set`.

   .. include:: /includes/important-unique-replica-set-names.rst

   If you use a configuration file, then start each :binary:`~bin.mongod`
   instance with a command that resembles the following:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongod --config /etc/mongodb.conf

   Change ``/etc/mongodb.conf`` to the location of your configuration
   file.

   .. note::

      You will likely want to use and configure a
      :term:`control script` to manage this process in production
      deployments. Control scripts are beyond the scope of this document.

#. Open a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected to **one** of the hosts by
   issuing the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      mongo

#. Use :method:`rs.initiate()` to initiate a replica set consisting of
   the current member and using the default configuration, as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.initiate()

#. Display the current :doc:`replica configuration </reference/replica-configuration>`:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.conf()

   The replica set configuration object resembles the following

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
         "_id" : "rs0",
         "version" : 4,
         "members" : [
            {
               "_id" : 1,
               "host" : "mongodb0.example.net:27017"
            }
         ]
      }

.. end-4member

#. In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell connected to the :term:`primary`, add
   the remaining members to the replica set using :method:`rs.add()` in
   the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell on the current primary (in this example,
   ``mongodb0.example.net``). The commands should resemble the
   following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.add("mongodb1.example.net")
      rs.add("mongodb2.example.net")

   When complete, you should have a fully functional replica set.
   The new replica set will elect a :term:`primary`.

.. end-3member

.. begin-conclusion-content

Check the status of your replica set at any time with the
:method:`rs.status()` operation.

.. seealso:: The documentation of the following shell functions for
   more information:

   - :method:`rs.initiate()`
   - :method:`rs.conf()`
   - :method:`rs.reconfig()`
   - :method:`rs.add()`

   Refer to :doc:`Replica Set Read and Write Semantics </applications/replication>`
   for a detailed explanation of read and write semantics in MongoDB.
