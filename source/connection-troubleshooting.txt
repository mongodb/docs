This page offers potential solutions to issues you might encounter when
using the {+driver-long+} to connect to a MongoDB deployment.

.. note::

   This page addresses only connection issues. If you encounter any other issues
   with MongoDB or the driver, visit the following resources:

   - The :ref:`Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) <csharp-faq>` for the
     {+driver-short+}
   - The :ref:`Issues & Help <csharp-issues-help>` page, which has
     information about reporting bugs, contributing to the driver, and 
     finding additional resources
   - The `MongoDB Community Forums <https://community.mongodb.com>`__ for
     questions, discussions, or general technical support

Connection Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following error message indicates that the driver cannot connect to a server
on the specified hostname or port. Multiple situations can generate this error
message. In this sample error message, the hostname is ``127.0.0.1`` and the
port is ``27017``:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017

The following sections describe actions you can take to potentially resolve the
issue.

.. _csharp-troubleshooting-connection-string-port:

Check Your Connection String
----------------------------

Verify that the hostname and port number in the connection string are both
accurate. The default port value for a MongoDB instance is
``27017``, but you can configure MongoDB to communicate on another port.

.. _csharp-troubleshooting-connection-firewall:

Configure Your Firewall
-----------------------

Verify that the ports your MongoDB deployment listens on are not blocked by a
firewall on the same network. MongoDB uses port ``27017`` by default. To learn
more about the default ports MongoDB uses and how to change them, see
:manual:`Default MongoDB Port </reference/default-mongodb-port/>`.

.. warning::

   Do not open a port in your firewall unless you are sure it's the port
   used by your MongoDB deployment.

Authentication Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+driver-short+} can fail to connect to a MongoDB instance if
the authentication mechanism is not configured correctly. If you are using ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
or ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` for authentication and the driver fails to connect, the
driver might raise an error message similar to one of the following messages:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Command failed with error 18 (AuthenticationFailed): 'Authentication
   failed.' on server <hostname>:<port>.

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Authentication failed","attr":{"mechanism":"SCRAM-SHA-256","principalName":
   "<db_username>","<auth database>":"<db_username>","client":"127.0.0.1:2012",
   "result":"UserNotFound: Could not find user}}

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   connection() error occurred during connection handshake: auth error:
   sasl conversation error: unable to authenticate using mechanism
   "SCRAM-SHA-256": (AuthenticationFailed) Authentication failed.

The following sections describe actions you can take to potentially resolve the
issue.

.. _csharp-troubleshooting-connection-string-auth:

Check Your Connection String
----------------------------

An invalid connection string is the most common cause of authentication
issues when attempting to connect to MongoDB using connection strings and
``SCRAM-SHA-256`` or ``SCRAM-SHA-1``.

.. tip::

   For more information about connection strings,
   see :ref:`Connection URI <csharp-connection-uri>` in the Connection Guide.

If your connection string contains a username and password, ensure that they
are in the correct format. If the username or password includes any of the
following characters, they must be
`percent encoded <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1>`__:

.. code-block:: none

    : / ? # [ ] @

The following example shows how to percent encode "#MyPassword?":

.. code-block:: csharp

   Console.WriteLine(System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlEncode("#MyPassword?"));

This results in the following output:

.. code-block:: none

   %23MyPassword%3F

.. _csharp-troubleshooting-connection-mongoclientsettings:

Verify the MongoClientSettings Properties
-----------------------------------------

You can use a ``MongoClientSettings`` object to configure the settings when
attempting to connect to a MongoDB deployment. You can use the ``Credential``
property to set authentication information. If the credential information is not
correct, you will receive authentication errors when you attempt to connect to
your MongoDB deployment.

.. _csharp-troubleshooting-connection-admin:

Verify the User Is in the Authentication Database
-------------------------------------------------

To successfully authenticate a connection by using a username and password with
``SCRAM-SHA-256`` or ``SCRAM-SHA-1``, the username must be defined in the
authentication database. The default authentication database is the ``admin``
database. To use a different database for authentication, specify the
``authSource`` option in the connection string. The following example instructs the
driver to use ``users`` as the authentication database:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   using MongoDB.Driver;

   // Connection URI
   const string connectionUri = "mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>/?authSource=users";

   // Create a new client and connect to the server
   var client = new MongoClient(connectionUri);

You can also set configuration settings by creating a ``MongoClientSettings``
object and passing that to the ``MongoClient`` constructor. You can use the
``Credential`` property to set the login credentials including specifying the
authentication database. For more information about using ``MongoClientSettings``
as well as some examples, see
:ref:`Using MongoClientSettings <csharp-mongo-client-settings>`.

You can check if this is the issue by attempting to connect to a MongoDB
instance hosted on the local machine with the same code. A deployment on
the same machine doesn't require any authorization to connect.

.. _csharp-troubleshooting-connection-X509:

X.509 Credential Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/troubleshooting/x509.rst

Error Sending Message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the driver fails to send a command after you make a request,
it may display the following error message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   com.mongodb.MongoSocketWriteException: Exception sending message

The following sections describe actions you can take to potentially resolve the
issue.

Check the User Permissions
--------------------------

Verify that you've accessed the MongoDB deployment with the correct user. The
term "message" in the error can be a command sent by the driver.
If you are using a user that doesn't have permissions to send the command, the
driver could generate this error.

Also ensure that the user has the appropriate permissions for the message you
are sending. MongoDB uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to control access
to a MongoDB deployment. For more information about how to configure RBAC in MongoDB,
see :manual:`Role-Based Access Control </core/authorization/>`.

Configure Your Firewall
-----------------------

The firewall needs to have an open port for communicating with the MongoDB
instance. For more information about configuring the firewall, see
:ref:`Configure Your Firewall <csharp-troubleshooting-connection-firewall>` in
the Connection Error section.

.. _csharp-troubleshooting-connection-number-connections:

Check the Number of Connections
-------------------------------

Each ``MongoClient`` instance supports a maximum number of concurrent open
connections in its connection pool. You can configure the parameter ``MaxConnectionPoolSize``
which defines this limit. The default value is ``100``. If there are already a
number of open connections equal to ``MaxConnectionPoolSize``, the server waits until
a connection becomes available. If this wait time exceeds the ``MaxConnectionIdleTime``
value, the driver responds with an error.

For more information about how connection pooling works, see
:ref:`How Does Connection Pooling Work in the {+driver-short+}? <csharp-faq-connection-pool>`
in the FAQ.

Too Many Open Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver creates the following error message when it attempts to open a
connection, but it's reached the maximum number of connections:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   connection refused because too many open connections

The following section describes a method that may help resolve the issue.

Check the Number of Connections
-------------------------------

If you need to create more open connections, increase ``MaxConnectionPoolSize``. For more
information about checking the number of connections, see
:ref:`Check the Number of Connections <csharp-troubleshooting-connection-number-connections>`
in the Error Sending Message section.

Timeout Error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the network is not able to deliver a request from the driver to the server
quickly enough, it can time out. When this happens, you might receive an error message
similar to the following message:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   timed out while checking out a connection from connection pool: context canceled

If you receive this error, try the following action to resolve the
issue.

Set connectTimeoutMS
--------------------

The driver may hang when it's unable to establish a connection because the driver
takes too long attempting to reach unreachable replica set nodes. You can limit the
time the driver spends attempting to establish the connection by using the
``connectTimeMS`` setting. To learn more about this setting, see the
:manual:`Timeout Options </reference/connection-string/#timeout-options>` in
the Server manual.

You should ensure the ``connectTimeoutMS`` setting is not lower than
the highest network latency you have to a member of the set. If one of the
secondary members has a latency of 10000 milliseconds, setting the
``connectTimeoutMS`` to 9000 prevents the driver from ever connecting to that
member.

You can set this option on the connection string. The following example sets
``connectTimeoutMS`` to 10000 milliseconds.

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: true

   using MongoDB.Driver;

   // Connection URI
   const string connectionUri = "mongodb://<db_username>:<db_password>@<hostname>:<port>/?connectTimeoutMS=10000";

   // Create a new client and connect to the server
   var client = new MongoClient(connectionUri);

You can also set configuration settings by creating a ``MongoClientSettings``
object and passing that to the ``MongoClient`` constructor. For more information
about using ``MongoClientSettings`` as well as some examples, see
:ref:`Using MongoClientSettings <csharp-mongo-client-settings>`.

Check the Number of Connections
-------------------------------

The number of connections to the server may exceed ``MaxConnectionPoolSize``. For more
information about checking the number of connections, see
:ref:`Check the Number of Connections <csharp-troubleshooting-connection-number-connections>`
in the Error Sending Message section.
