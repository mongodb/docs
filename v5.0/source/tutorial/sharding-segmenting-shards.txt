This tutorial shows you how to segment data using :ref:`zone-sharding`.

Consider the following scenarios where segmenting data by application or
customer may be necessary:

* A database serving multiple applications
* A database serving multiple customers
* A database that requires isolating ranges or subsets of application
  or customer data
* A database that requires resource allocation for ranges or subsets of
  application or customer data

This diagram illustrates a sharded cluster using zones to
segment data based on application or customer. This allows for data to
be isolated to specific shards. Additionally, each shard can have specific
hardware allocated to fit the performance requirement of the data stored on
that shard.

Scenario
--------

An application tracks the score of a user along with a ``client`` field,
storing scores in the ``gamify`` database under the ``users`` collection.
Each possible value of ``client`` requires its own zone to allow for
data segmentation. It also allows the administrator to optimize the
hardware for each shard associated to a ``client`` for performance and cost.

The following documents represent a partial view of two users:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fa"),
     "client" : "robot",
     "userid" : 123,
     "high_score" : 181,
     ...,
   }
   {
     "_id" : ObjectId("56f08c447fe58b2e96f595fb"),
     "client" : "fruitos",
     "userid" : 456,
     "high_score" : 210,
     ...,
   }

Shard Key
~~~~~~~~~

The ``users`` collection uses the ``{ client : 1, userid : 1 }`` compound
index as the shard key.

The ``client`` field in each document allows creating a zone for each
distinct client value.

The ``userid`` field provides a high :ref:`cardinality
<shard-key-cardinality>` and low :ref:`frequency <shard-key-frequency>`
component to the shard key relative to ``country``.

See :ref:`Choosing a Shard Key <sharding-shard-key-requirements>` for more
general instructions on selecting a shard key.

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application requires adding shard to a zone associated to a specific
``client``.

The sharded cluster deployment currently consists of four :term:`shards
<shard>`.

Zones
~~~~~

For this application, there are two client zones.

.. include:: /images/sharding-segmenting-shards-tags.rst

Robot client ("robot")
   This zone represents all documents where ``client : robot``.

FruitOS client ("fruitos")
   This zone represents all documents where ``client : fruitos``.

Write Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With zones, if an inserted or updated document matches a
configured zone, it can only be written to a shard inside that zone.

MongoDB can write documents that do not match a configured zone to any
shard in the cluster.

.. note:: 

   The behavior described above requires the cluster to be in a steady state
   with no chunks violating a configured zone. See the following section
   on the :ref:`balancer <sharding-tiered-hardware-balancing>` for more
   information.

Read Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB can route queries to a specific shard if the query includes at least
the ``client`` field.

For example, MongoDB can attempt a :ref:`targeted read operation
<sharding-mongos-targeted>` on the following query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   chatDB = db.getSiblingDB("gamify")
   chatDB.users.find( { "client" : "robot" , "userid" : "123" } )

Queries without the ``client`` field perform :ref:`broadcast operations
<sharding-mongos-broadcast>`.

Balancer
~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` :ref:`migrates
<sharding-chunk-migration>` chunks to the appropriate shard respecting any
configured zones. Until the migration, shards may contain chunks that violate
configured zones. Once balancing completes, shards should only
contain chunks whose ranges do not violate its assigned zones.

Adding or removing zones or zone ranges can result in chunk migrations.
Depending on the size of your data set and the number of chunks a zone or zone
range affects, these migrations may impact cluster performance. Consider
running your :ref:`balancer <sharding-balancing>` during specific scheduled
windows. See :ref:`sharding-schedule-balancing-window` for a tutorial on how
to set a scheduling window.

Security
~~~~~~~~

For sharded clusters running with :ref:`authorization`, authenticate as a user
with at least the :authrole:`clusterManager` role on the ``admin`` database.

Procedure
---------

You must be connected to a :binary:`~bin.mongos` associated to the target
:term:`sharded cluster` to proceed. You cannot create zones or zone ranges by
connecting directly to a :term:`shard`.
