Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) is the
default authentication mechanism for MongoDB.

When a user :ref:`authenticates <authentication-auth-as-user>`
themselves, MongoDB uses SCRAM to verify the supplied user credentials
against the user's :data:`name <admin.system.users.user>`,
:data:`password <admin.system.users.credentials>` and
:data:`authentication database <admin.system.users.db>`.

SCRAM is based on the IETF `RFC 5802
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802>`_ standard that defines best
practices for the implementation of challenge-response mechanisms for
authenticating users with passwords.

Features
--------

MongoDB's implementation of SCRAM provides:

- A tunable work factor (the iteration count)
- Per-user random salts
- Bi-directional authentication between server and client

SCRAM Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB supports the following SCRAM mechanisms:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - SCRAM Mechanism
     - Description

   * - ``SCRAM-SHA-1``

     - Uses the SHA-1 hashing function.

       To modify the iteration count for ``SCRAM-SHA-1``, see
       :parameter:`scramIterationCount`.

   * - ``SCRAM-SHA-256``

     - Uses the SHA-256 hashing function.

       To modify the iteration count for ``SCRAM-SHA-256``, see
       :parameter:`scramSHA256IterationCount`.


When you create or update a SCRAM user, you can indicate:

- the SCRAM mechanism to use
- whether the server or the client digests the password

When you use ``SCRAM-SHA-256``, MongoDB requires server-side password
hashing, which means that the server digests the password. For more
information, see :method:`db.createUser()` and
:method:`db.updateUser()`.

Driver Support
--------------

The minimum driver versions that support ``SCRAM`` are:

.. |driver-compatibility-heading| replace:: Version

.. include:: /includes/list-table-3.0-driver-compatibility.rst
