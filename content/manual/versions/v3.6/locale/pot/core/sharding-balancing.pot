msgid "Balancing is the process MongoDB uses to distribute data of a sharded collection evenly across a :term:`sharded cluster`. When a :term:`shard` has too many of a sharded collection's :term:`chunks <chunk>` compared to other shards, MongoDB automatically balances the chunks across the shards. The balancing procedure for :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>` is entirely transparent to the user and application layer."
