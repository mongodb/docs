You can enable autocomplete for {+mcli+} commands to see available
commands and their syntax directly in your shell.

Enable Autocomplete
-------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Homebrew Installation 
      :tabid: Homebrew

      If you installed the {+mcli+} with Homebrew, autocomplete
      functionality is included with the installation. You must
      configure your shell to enable its completion support. To enable
      autocomplete for your shell, refer to the
      `Homebrew Documentation
      <https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion>`__.

   .. tab:: Other Installation
      :tabid: non-Homebrew

      If you did not install the {+mcli+} with Homebrew, the procedure
      to enable autocomplete depends on the shell in which you
      run the {+mcli+}.
      
      Z Shell
      ~~~~~~~

      If you use ``zsh`` to run the {+mcli+}, add the following to your
      ``~/.zshrc``:

      .. code-block:: sh

         autoload -Uz compinit
         compinit

         source <(mongocli completion zsh)
         compdef _mongocli mongocli

      Run the following command to reload your ``zsh`` profile:

      .. code-block:: sh

         source ~/.zshrc

      Bash
      ~~~~

      If you use Bash to run the {+mcli+}, add the following to your
      ``~/.bash_profile``:

      .. code-block:: sh

         eval "$(mongocli completion bash)"

      Run the following command to reload your Bash profile:

      .. code-block:: sh

         source ~/.bash_profile

Use ``Tab`` to Autocomplete Commands
------------------------------------

Once you have autocomplete configured, you can autocomplete commands by
typing ``mongocli`` in your shell and pressing the ``Tab`` key. Press
``Tab`` multiple times to cycle through available autocompletion
options.

You can press ``Tab`` at any stage of writing your command to see
available autocomplete options.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

When you type ``mongocli`` in your shell and press ``Tab``, the output
resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   atlas          -- Atlas operations.
   cloud-manager  -- Cloud Manager operations.
   completion     -- Generate shell completion scripts
   config         -- Configure a profile to store access settings for your MongoDB deployment.
   help           -- Help about any command
   iam            -- Organization and projects operations.
   ops-manager    -- Ops Manager operations.

If you type a specific property such as ``atlas`` as part of your
command, you can see autocompletion options for your selected
property.

For example, when you type ``mongocli atlas`` in your shell and press
``Tab``, the output resembles the following:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   alerts     -- Manage alerts for your project.
   backups    -- Manage backups for your project.
   clusters   -- Manage clusters for your project.
   dbusers    -- Manage database users for your project.
   events     -- Manage events for your project.
   logs       -- Download host logs for your project.
   metrics    -- Get measurements on the state of the MongoDB process.
   processes  -- Manage MongoDB processes for your project.
   whitelist  -- Manage the IP whitelist for a project.
