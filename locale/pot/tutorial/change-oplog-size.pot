msgid "The :term:`oplog` exists internally as a :term:`capped collection`, so you cannot modify its size in the course of normal operations. In most cases the :ref:`default oplog size <replica-set-oplog-sizing>` is an acceptable size; however, in some situations you may need a larger or smaller oplog. For example, you might need to change the oplog size if your applications perform large numbers of multi-updates or deletes in short periods of time."
