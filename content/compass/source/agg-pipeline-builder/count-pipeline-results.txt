You can view the number of documents outputted by your pipeline with the 
:guilabel:`count results` button.

About this Task 
---------------

When you delete or add a document, you must manually refresh the 
:guilabel:`count results` value on the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab to reflect 
the new document count.

Before You Begin 
----------------

To count result documents, you must first :ref:`create and run 
<compass-create-agg-pipeline>` your aggregation pipeline. You can't count result 
documents while editing your pipeline.
