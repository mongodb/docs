Overview
--------

If you are installing PyMongo and the Monitoring agent on systems that do not
have C compilers, you can create a ``.egg`` package of PyMongo with C
extensions to install on your system or systems.

While the C extensions are not required for MMS Monitoring, they significantly
improve performance. You must have a C compiler (e.g. ``gcc``) and Python
header files installed on your system.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. include:: /includes/monitoring-install-reqs-build-pymongo-c.rst

Considerations
--------------

The ``.egg`` file created with these instructions will only work on systems that
resemble the environment on which you built the package. Ensure operating
systems, versions of Python, and architecture (i.e. “32” or “64” bit) match.

Commands below use PyMongo version 2.6.3. If the current version is higher,
replace 2.6.3 with the current number.

Procedure

Also, consider reading the `PyMongo documentation
<http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/installation.html>`_.
