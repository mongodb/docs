.. _5.0-rel-notes-agg:

Aggregation
-----------

General Aggregation Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``let``
```````

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, :dbcommand:`aggregate` and
:method:`db.collection.aggregate()` have a ``let`` option to specify a
list of variables and values that can be used elsewhere in the
aggregation pipeline. This supports tasks that could otherwise only be
performed using the :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command, and reduces the risk
of MQL injection attacks.


.. _5.0-rel-notes-repl-sets:

Replica Sets
------------

Limit Removed for ``members[n]._id`` Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 5.0, the :rsconf:`members[n]._id` field may be any
integer value greater than or equal to ``0``. Previously, this value was
limited to an integer between ``0`` and ``255`` inclusive.
