  {{role}} is for internal use and not intended for most users.

  Creates a very verbose :term:`diagnostic log` for troubleshooting and
  recording various errors. MongoDB writes these log files in the
  :setting:`~storage.dbPath` directory in a series of files that begin with the
  string ``diaglog`` and end with the initiation time of the logging as a
  hex string.

  The specified value configures the level of verbosity:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 40

     * - Value

       - Setting

     * - 0

       - Log read operations.

     * - 3

       - Log both read and write operations.

     * - 7

       - Log write and some read operations.

  You can use the :program:`mongosniff` tool to replay this output for
  investigation. Given a typical diaglog file located at
  ``/data/db/diaglog.4f76a58c``, you might use a command in the following
  form to read these files:

  .. code-block:: sh

     mongosniff --source DIAGLOG /data/db/diaglog.4f76a58c

   .. warning::

      Setting the diagnostic level to ``0`` will cause :program:`mongod`
      to stop writing data to the :term:`diagnostic log` file. However,
      the :program:`mongod` instance will continue to keep the file open,
      even if it is no longer writing data to the file. If you want to
      rename, move, or delete the diagnostic log you must cleanly shut
      down the :program:`mongod` instance before doing so.

  Stores each database's files in its own folder in the :term:`data

  :setting:`~storage.directoryPerDB` option alters the storage pattern of the data
  directory.

  Use this option in conjunction with your file system and device
  configuration so that MongoDB will store data on a number of distinct
  disk devices to increase write throughput or disk capacity.

  .. warning::

     To enable this option for an **existing** system, migrate the
     database-specific data files to the new directory structure before
     enabling :setting:`~storage.directoryPerDB`. Database-specific data files
     begin with the name of an existing database and end with either
     "``ns``" or a number. For example, the following data directory
     includes files for the ``local`` and ``test`` databases:

     .. code-block:: none

        local.1
        local.ns
        test.0
        test.1
        test.ns

     After migration, the data directory would have the following structure:

     .. code-block:: none

        mongod.lock
        local/local.0

directive: option
description: |
  The maximum amount of time the {{program}} process allows between

  performance.

  The default journal commit interval is 100 milliseconds if a single
  block device (e.g. physical volume, RAID device, or LVM volume) contains
  both the journal and the data files.

  If the journal is on a different block device than the data files the
  default journal commit interval is 30 milliseconds.

  To force :program:`mongod` to commit to the journal more frequently, you
  can specify ``j:true``. When a write operation with ``j:true`` is
  pending, :program:`mongod` will reduce :setting:`~storage.journal.commitIntervalMs`

  Determines which indexes :term:`secondary` members of a :term:`replica
  set` load into memory before applying operations from the oplog. By
  default secondaries load all indexes related to an operation into memory
  before applying operations from the oplog. This option can have one of
  the following values:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 40

     * - Value

       - Description

     * - ``none``

       - Secondaries do not load indexes into memory.

     * - ``all``

       - Secondaries load all indexes related to an operation.

     * - ``_id_only``

       - Secondaries load no additional indexes into memory beyond the
         already existing ``_id`` index.

  For use with the :option:`--slave` option. When set,
  the {{role}} option allows this slave to automatically
  resync if it is more than 10 seconds behind the master. This
  setting may be problematic if the :option:`--oplogSize` specifies
  a too small oplog.

  If the :term:`oplog` is not large enough to store the difference in
  changes between the master's current state and the state of the slave,
  this instance will forcibly resync itself unnecessarily. If you don't
  specify {{role}}, the slave will not attempt an automatic resync more

      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 40

      * - Value

  certificate-key file is encrypted. In all cases, the {{program}} will
  redact the password from all logging and reporting output.

  .. versionchanged:: 2.6
     If the private key in the PEM file is encrypted and you do not
     specify the {{role}} option, the {{program}} will prompt for a

  file for :ref:`membership authentication <x509-internal-authentication>`
  for the cluster or replica set.

  If {{role}} does not specify the ``.pem`` file for internal cluster

  Bypasses the validation checks for SSL certificates on other servers
  in the cluster and allows the use of invalid certificates. When using
  the :setting:`~net.ssl.allowInvalidCertificates` setting, MongoDB
  logs as a warning the use of the invalid certificate.

program: mongod
name: sslWeakCertificateValidation

description: |
  .. versionadded:: 2.4

  Disables the requirement for SSL certificate validation that
  ``--sslCAFile`` enables. With the {{role}} option, the {{program}}
  will accept connections when the client does not present a certificate
  when establishing the connection.

  If the client presents a certificate and the {{program}} has {{role}}
  enabled, the {{program}} will validate the certificate using the root
  certificate chain specified by ``--sslCAFile`` and reject clients
  with invalid certificates.

  Use the {{role}} option if you have a mixed deployment that includes
  clients that do not or cannot present certificates to the {{program}}.

  Enables auditing. The {{role}} option can have one of the following values:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 15 50

     * - Value

       - Description

     * - ``syslog``

       - Output the audit events to syslog in JSON format. Not available on
         Windows. Audit messages have a syslog severity level of ``info``
         and a facility level of ``user``.

         The syslog message limit can result in the truncation of
         audit messages. The auditing system will neither detect the
         truncation nor error upon its occurrence.

     * - ``console``

       - Output the audit events to ``stdout`` in JSON format.

     * - ``file``

       - Output the audit events to the file specified in
         :option:`--auditPath` in the format specified in
         :option:`--auditFormat`.

  .. include:: /includes/note-audit-in-enterprise-only.rst

  .. versionadded:: 2.6

  Specifies the format of the output file if :option:`--auditDestination`
  is ``file``. The {{role}} option can have one of the following values:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 15 50

     * - Value

       - Description

     * - ``JSON``

       - Output the audit events in JSON format to the file specified
         in :option:`--auditPath`.

     * - ``BSON``

       - Output the audit events in BSON binary format to the file
         specified in :option:`--auditPath`.

  Printing audit events to a file in JSON format degrades server
  performance more than printing to a file in BSON format.
