================================
Change Replica Set to WiredTiger
================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


.. note::

   Starting in version 4.0, MongoDB deprecates the MMAPv1 storage
   engine and will remove MMAPv1 in a future release.

   Use this tutorial to update a replica set to use :ref:`WiredTiger
   <storage-wiredtiger>`. The procedure updates the replica set in a
   rolling fashion to avoid downtime.

Considerations
--------------

MongoDB 3.0 or Greater

Procedure
---------

The following procedure updates the replica set in a rolling fashion.
The procedure updates the :term:`secondary` members first, then steps
down the :term:`primary`, and updates the stepped-down member.

To update a member to WiredTiger, the procedure removes a member's
data, starts :binary:`~bin.mongod` with WiredTiger, and performs an
:doc:`initial sync </tutorial/resync-replica-set-member>`.


A. Update the secondary members to WiredTiger.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update the secondary members one at a time:

   .. include:: /includes/steps/change-replica-set-wiredtiger.rst

Repeat the steps for the remaining secondary members, updating them one
at a time.

B. Step down the primary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once all the secondary members have been upgraded to WiredTiger,
connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary and use
:method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and force an election
of a new primary.

.. container:: admonition

   .. code-block:: javascript

      rs.stepDown()

C. Update the old primary.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the primary has stepped down and become a secondary, update the
secondary to use WiredTiger as before:
