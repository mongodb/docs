   This page covers |cloudgov| *database* user accounts. Database users 
   are separate from |cloudgov-short| users. Database users can access 
   MongoDB databases, while |cloudgov-short| users can access the 
   |cloudgov-short| application itself.

Create database users to provide clients access to the clusters in your 
project. A database user's access is determined by the roles assigned 
to the user. |cloudgov-short| user roles are the same as 
:atlas:`Atlas User Roles </reference/user-roles/>`. 
When you create a database user, the user is added to all clusters in 
your |cloudgov-short| project.

-----------------------------------

Database users who authenticate with 
:manual:`SCRAM </core/security-scram/>` must use ``SCRAM-SHA-256``.

See the |service| documentation to 
:atlas:`Configure Database Users </security-add-mongodb-users>`
