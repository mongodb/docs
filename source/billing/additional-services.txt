.. _data-lake-billing:

|service| |data-lake| (Beta)
----------------------------

|service| |data-lake| incurs costs for the amount of data scanned and
returned by the service.

Total Data Scanned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for the total number of bytes that |data-lake| scans
from your |aws| S3 buckets, rounded up to the nearest megabyte.
|service| charges **$5.00 per TB** of scanned data, with a minimum of
**10 MB** or **$0.00005 per query**.

You can use partitioning strategies and compression in |aws| S3 to
reduce the amount of data scanned.

Total Data Returned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| charges for the total number of bytes returned by
|data-lake|. This total is the sum of the following data transfers:

- The number of bytes transferred between |data-lake| service nodes
- The number of bytes transferred from |data-lake| to the client

Returned data is billed as outlined in the :guilabel:`Data Transfer
Fees` section of the |service-pricing|_. The cost of data transfer
depends on the Cloud Service Provider charges for same-region,
region-to-region, or region-to-internet data transfer.

-----------------

|service| supports
:doc:`Encryption at Rest via customer KMS </security-kms-encryption>`
and :doc:`LDAP User Authentication and Authorization </security-ldaps>`

Excluding |service-fullname| Enterprise and |service-fullname| Platinum
customers, |service| charges a 45% uplift to the cost of each cluster
with **LDAP User Authentication and Authorization** and/or
**Encryption at Rest via customer KMS** enabled.
