The |k8s-op-full| uses the |k8s| API and tools to manage MongoDB
clusters running within your |k8s| cluster. |k8s-op-short| works together 
with MongoDB |com|. This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy 
and connect to your first MongoDB replica set in |cloud| with |k8s-op-short|. 
You can use |kind| to quickly set up a cluster.
