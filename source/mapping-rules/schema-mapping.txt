Schema mapping is the process by which you decide how your source relational schema 
should be represented in your target MongoDB database. Facilitate the schema 
mapping process in {+rel-mig+} through customized mappings rules.

Mapping Rules
-------------

During the schema mapping design process, {+rel-mig+} automatically derives 
the source data model from the schema of your relational database. The destination data 
model can be influenced by customizing:

- Mapping Rule options

- Project ID field options

.. tip::

   {+rel-mig+} supports Oracle materialized views. If your data model requires 
   complex mappings that involve many tables, you can create a materialized view 
   using a custom SQL query instead. The materialized view acts as a single source 
   table and simplifies the required mappings. Performing complex joins in your 
   Oracle source database can streamline your migration project and may improve 
   performance compared to a migration job that performs the same transformations 
   live. For more information, see the 
   `Oracle SQL Language Reference <https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/CREATE-MATERIALIZED-VIEW.html>`__.

   {+rel-mig+} does not support materialized views for other databases at this time.

Example
-------

This section provides a scenario and example implementation for the schema mapping 
process. This example converts a relational data model to a MongoDB data 
model.

Using the ``MongoEnterprises`` relational database, the goal is to flatten 
all of the database's tables, so that all the order and customer data is 
available in a single MongoDB collection.

Use-Case Denormalizing Table Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following image shows the relational data model to be denormalized using the 
{+rel-mig+}.

Mapping Rule Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using {+rel-mig+}, the goal is to achieve the following MongoDB data model. 
The ``Order`` collection contains all the child elements from the ``Customer``, 
``Order``, ``Product`` and ``Order Line`` tables. The collection has nested 
objects for the migrated tables. The results look like this:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "_id": {
       "OrderID": 1
     },
     "CustomerID": 1,
     "OrderStatusID": 1,
     "TotalAmount": 550,
     "Customer": {
       "CustomerID": 1,
       "Name": "Joelynn Fawthrop",
       "Address1": "86 Dwight Pass",
       "Address2": "Carregal",
       "Address3": "3800-854"
     },
     "OrderLines": [
       {
         "OrderLineID": 1,
         "OrderID": 1,
         "ProductID": 1,
         "Quantity": 1,
         "Product": {
           "ProductID": 1,
           "Name": "MongoDB 5.0 Action Figure",
           "Price": 50
         }
       },
       {
         "OrderLineID": 4,
         "OrderID": 1,
         "ProductID": 3,
         "Quantity": 1,
         "Product": {
           "ProductID": 3,
           "Name": "Gold Plated MongoDB Compass",
           "Price": 500
         }
       }
     ],
     "OrderStatus": {
       "OrderStatusID": 1,
       "Name": "Order Placed"
     }
   }

Mapping Rule Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To accomplish the target data model results with {+rel-mig+}, configure 
the ``Order`` table with the following mapping rule options:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Relational Table
     - Mapping Rule Type
     - Root Path
  
   * - Order
     - :ref:`New Documents <rm-new-documents>`
     - N/A

   * - OrderLine
     - :ref:`Embedded array <rm-embedded-array>`
     - ``OrderLines``

   * - Customer
     - :ref:`Embedded documents <rm-embedded-documents>`
     - ``Customer``

   * - OrderStatus
     - :ref:`Embedded documents <rm-embedded-documents>`
     - ``OrderStatus``

   * - Product
     - :ref:`Embedded documents <rm-embedded-documents>`
     - ``OrderLInes.Product``
