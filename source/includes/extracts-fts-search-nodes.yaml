  You can deploy search nodes for dedicated (``M10`` or higher)
  {+clusters+} only. You can't add search nodes on free (``M0``) and
  shared (``M2`` and ``M5``) tier {+clusters+}. You can't modify an
  existing {+cluster+} that doesn't already have search nodes to add
  search nodes from the {+atlas-ui+}. Use the {+atlas-admin-api+} to
  provision search nodes for existing single-region {+clusters+} on
  |aws|.

ref: fts-search-nodes-cloud-provider

  You can host the search nodes only on |aws|. You can't deploy search
  nodes separately for |gcp| or |azure| {+clusters+} when you create or
  modify these {+clusters+}. You can't deploy search nodes separately
  for :ref:`serverless instances <create-new-serverless-instance>`,
  :ref:`multi-cloud clusters <create-cluster-multi-region>`, or
  :ref:`global clusters <global-clusters>`.

ref: fts-search-nodes-cloud-provider-regions
content: |
  |service| deploys the search nodes in the same region as your electable,
  read-only, and analytics nodes. However, you can't deploy search nodes
  separately for workload isolation in certain |aws| regions. So, the
  following {+atlas-ui+} behavior applies:
  
  - If you select any of the following regions for your {+cluster+} 
    nodes first, |service| disables the :guilabel:`Search nodes for
    workload isolation` toggle.
  - If you enable :guilabel:`Search nodes for workload isolation`
    first, |service| disables the following in the dropdown for regions
    under :guilabel:`Electable nodes for high availability`.

  |service| doesn't support the following |aws| regions for search nodes.

  You can select any of the following search tiers for your search
  nodes in the :guilabel:`Search Tier` tab. By default, |service| deploys
  search nodes on ``S20``. You can select a higher tier for faster queries
  and more complex aggregations or a lower tier for smaller workloads.

ref: fts-migrate-delete-search-nodes
content: |
  If you delete all existing search nodes on your {+cluster+}, there will
  be a brief interruption in processing your search query results while
  |service| migrates from ``mongot`` processes running separately on
  dedicated search nodes to ``mongot`` processes running alongside
  ``mongod``. However, you won't experience any downtime while indexes
  are migrated and no stale data.

---
ref: fts-migrate-add-search-nodes
content: |
  When you add search nodes to a {+cluster+} that doesn't have any search
  nodes, the existing ``mongot`` processes running alongside ``mongod``
  tail writes to the database that happen after |fts| completed the
  initial sync and the ``mongot`` processes on the new dedicated search
  nodes perform an initial sync on the required collections. This
  results in dual reads during the migration process.
