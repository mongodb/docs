Sharding

.. _sharding-background:

Sharding distributes a single logical database system across a cluster
of machines. Sharding uses range-based portioning to distribute
:term:`documents <document>` based on a specific :term:`shard key`.

For a general introduction to sharding, cluster operations, and
relevant implications and administration see:
:doc:`/faq/sharding`.



Sharded Cluster Use and Operation
---------------------------------

The documents in this section introduce sharded clusters, their
operation, functioning, and use. If you are unfamiliar with data
partitioning, or MongoDB's sharding implementation begin with these
documents:

The documents listed in this section address common sharded cluster
operational practices in greater detail.

Application Development Patterns for Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following documents describe processes that application developers
may find useful when developing applications that use data stored in a
MongoDB sharded cluster. For some cases you will also want to consider
the documentation of :doc:`/data-center-awareness`.
