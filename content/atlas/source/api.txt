You can interact with |service| programmatically to perform
administrative tasks or manage your deployments using the
following resources.

.. _atlas-admin-api-overview:

{+atlas-admin-api+}
-------------------------

.. include:: /includes/fact-atlas-admin-api-definition.rst

You can explore the various endpoints available through the {+atlas-admin-api+}
in MongoDB's `Postman workspace <https://www.postman.com/mongodb-devrel/workspace/mongodb-atlas-administration-apis/overview>`__.

To configure access for the {+atlas-admin-api+}, see :ref:`atlas-admin-api-access`.

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`Learn about the Atlas Admin API <atlas-admin-api>`.
   - `See the Atlas Admin API Specification <https://mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/api-resources-spec/v2>`__.

{+atlas-go-sdk+}
-------------------------------------------------

The {+atlas-go-sdk+} provides platform-specific and Go language-specific
tools, libraries, and documentation to help you build applications that
interact with |service| quickly and easily using the {+atlas-admin-api+}. 

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Atlas Go SDK <atlas-admin-sdk>`.

.. _atlas-programmatic-access-cli-overview:

{+voyage-api-full+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+voyage-api+} provides endpoints for accessing Voyage AI's
state-of-the-art embedding and reranking models. Use the REST API 
and available client SDKs to power search and retrieval in your AI applications.

{+atlas-cli+} 
-------------

The {+atlas-cli+} is a command-line interface built specifically for
|service-fullname|. You can use {+atlas-cli+} to interact with |service|
from the terminal with short and intuitive commands and accomplish
complex operational tasks such as creating a cluster or setting up an
access list interactively and programmatically.

.. _atlas-programmatic-access-terraform-overview:

HashiCorp Terraform MongoDB Atlas Provider
------------------------------------------

HashiCorp Terraform MongoDB |service| Provider provides refined
programmatic access and management of |service-fullname| resources. You
can define your environment using the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)
and deploy, update, and manage |service| infrastructure as code through
HashiCorp Terraform. This allows you to integrate |service| into your
continuous delivery workflows.

Cloud Development Kit for Terraform 
-----------------------------------

:abbr:`CDK (Cloud Development Kit)` for Terraform leverages the
|service-fullname| {+atlas-admin-api+} to enable provisioning across
popular programming languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python,
Java, Go, and C#. Utilizing the powerful capabilities of Terraform,
with :abbr:`CDKTF (Cloud Development Kit for Terraform)` you can now 
create, manage, and update your |service| resources with ease and deploy 
them seamlessly in the cloud without context switching from the native
programming language of choice.

.. _atlas-programmatic-access-cloudformation-overview:

MongoDB Atlas AWS CloudFormation Resources
------------------------------------------

|service| CloudFormation Resources helps you to manage
|service-fullname|. It simplifies provisioning and management of
|service| features on |aws|. You can create YAML- or JSON-based templates
for the service or application architectures you want and have |aws|
CloudFormation use those templates for quick and reliable provisioning
of the services or applications (called "stacks"). You can also easily
update or replicate the stacks as needed.

AWS Partner Solutions
---------------------

|aws| Partner Solutions provide pre-built CloudFormation templates to
help you provision a group of |service| resources for specific use cases
instead of deploying them one by one. Partner Solutions help you deploy
popular technologies to |aws| according to |aws| best practices.

   `AWS Quick Starts <https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/?solutions-all.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&solutions-all.sort-order=desc&awsf.filter-content-type=*all&awsf.filter-tech-category=*all&awsf.filter-industry=*all&solutions-all.q=mongodb&solutions-all.q_operator=AND>`__.

AWS Cloud Development Kit 
-------------------------

If you prefer using familiar programming languages like JavaScript,
TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go rather than using YAML or |json|,
you can use the |aws| :abbr:`CDK (Cloud Development Kit)` to deploy
|service| resources. When you execute your |aws| :abbr:`CDK (Cloud 
Development Kit)` applications, they automatically generate
CloudFormation templates, which in turn utilize the |aws| CloudFormation
service for resource provisioning. This way, you benefit from the
abstraction and flexibility provided by |aws| :abbr:`CDK (Cloud
Development Kit)` and take advantage of the robustness of CloudFormation
for infrastructure management, while still using the programming
language of your choice.

.. _atlas-programmatic-access-ak8so-overview:

|ak8so| 
-------

The |ak8so| enables you to manage |service| resources through custom resources that 
you apply in |k8s|. This allows an infrastructure as code approach to manage 
declarative configuration for |service| using a GitOps workflow, allowing developers 
to configure |service| resources using the same process and tooling that they use to 
deploy application components into |k8s|. The automatic creation of a |k8s| secret 
containing the connection string for a database user simplifies the process of 
connecting an application to the database.
