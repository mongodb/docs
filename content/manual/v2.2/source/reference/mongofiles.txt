Synopsis
--------

The :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` utility makes it possible to manipulate files
stored in your MongoDB instance in :term:`GridFS` objects from the
command line. It is particularly useful as it provides an interface
between objects stored in your file system and GridFS.

All :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` commands have the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles <options> <commands> <filename>

The components of the :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` command are:

1. :ref:`Options <mongofiles-options>`. You may use one or more of
   these options to control the behavior of :binary:`~bin.mongofiles`.

2. :ref:`Commands <mongofiles-commands>`. Use one of these commands to
   determine the action of :binary:`~bin.mongofiles`.

3. A filename which is either: the name of a file on your local's file
   system, or a GridFS object.

:binary:`~bin.mongofiles`, like :binary:`~bin.mongodump`, :binary:`~bin.mongoexport`,
:binary:`~bin.mongoimport`, and :binary:`~bin.mongorestore`, can access data
stored in a MongoDB data directory without requiring a running
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance, if no other :binary:`~bin.mongod` is running.

.. important:: For :term:`replica sets <replica set>`,
   :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` can only read from the set's
   ':term:`primary`.

.. _mongofiles-options:

Options
-------

.. program:: mongofiles

.. option:: --help

   Returns a basic help and usage text.

.. option:: --verbose, -v

   Increases the amount of internal reporting returned on the command
   line. Increase the verbosity with the ``-v`` form by including
   the option multiple times, (e.g. ``-vvvvv``.)

.. option:: --version

   Returns the version of the :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` utility.

.. option:: --host <hostname><:port>

   Specifies a resolvable hostname for the :binary:`~bin.mongod` that
   holds your GridFS system. By default :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` attempts
   to connect to a MongoDB process ruining on the localhost port
   number ``27017``.

   Optionally, specify a port number to connect a MongoDB instance
   running on a port other than 27017.

.. option:: --port <port>

   Specifies the port number, if the MongoDB instance is not running on
   the standard port. (i.e. ``27017``) You may also specify a port
   number using the :option:`mongofiles --host` command.

.. option:: --ipv6

   Enables IPv6 support that allows :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` to connect
   to the MongoDB instance using an IPv6 network. All MongoDB programs
   and processes, including :binary:`~bin.mongofiles`, disable IPv6
   support by default.

.. option:: --username <username>, -u <username>

   Specifies a username to authenticate to the MongoDB instance, if your
   database requires authentication. Use in conjunction with the
   :option:`mongofiles --password` option to supply a password.

.. option:: --password <password>

   Specifies a password to authenticate to the MongoDB instance. Use
   in conjunction with the :option:`mongofiles --username` option to
   supply a username.

   If you specify a :option:`--username <mongofiles --username>`
   without the :option:`--password` option, :binary:`~bin.mongofiles`
   will prompt for a password interactively.

.. option:: --dbpath <path>

   Specifies the directory of the MongoDB data files. If used, the
   :option:`--dbpath` option enables :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` to attach directly to
   local data files interact with the GridFS data without the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod`. To run with :option:`--dbpath`, :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` needs to lock
   access to the data directory: as a result, no :binary:`~bin.mongod` can access
   the same path while the process runs.

.. option:: --directoryperdb

   Use the :option:`--directoryperdb` in conjunction with the corresponding
   option to :binary:`~bin.mongod`, which allows :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` when
   running with the :option:`--dbpath` option and MongoDB uses an
   on-disk format where every database has a distinct
   directory. This option is only relevant when specifying the
   :option:`--dbpath` option.

.. option:: --journal

   Allows :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` operations to use the durability
   :term:`journal` when running with :option:`--dbpath`
   to ensure that the database maintains a recoverable state. This
   forces :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` to record all data on disk regularly.

.. option:: --db <db>, -d <db>

   Use the :option:`--db` option to specify the MongoDB database that stores
   or will store the GridFS files.

.. option:: --collection <collection>, -c <collection>

   This option has no use in this context and a future release may
   remove it. See :issue:`SERVER-4931` for more information.

.. option:: --local <filename>, -l <filename>

   Specifies the local filesystem name of a file for get and put
   operations.

   In the :command:`mongofiles put` and :command:`mongofiles get`
   commands the required ``<filename>`` modifier refers to the name
   the object will have in GridFS. :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` assumes that
   this reflects the file's name on the local file
   system. This setting overrides this default.

.. option:: --type <MIME>, t <MIME>

   Provides the ability to specify a :term:`MIME` type to describe the
   file inserted into GridFS storage. :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` omits this
   option in the default operation.

   Use only with :command:`mongofiles put` operations.

.. option:: --replace, -r

   Alters the behavior of :command:`mongofiles put` to replace
   existing GridFS objects with the specified local file, rather than
   adding an additional object with the same name.

   In the default operation, files will not be overwritten by a
   :command:`mongofiles put` option.

.. _mongofiles-commands:

Commands
--------

.. describe:: list <prefix>

   Lists the files in the GridFS store. The characters specified after
   ``list`` (e.g. ``<prefix>``) optionally limit the list of
   returned items to files that begin with that string of characters.

.. describe:: search <string>

   Lists the files in the GridFS store with names that match any
   portion of ``<string>``.

.. describe:: put <filename>

   Copy the specified file from the local file system into GridFS
   storage.

   Here, ``<filename>`` refers to the name the object will have in
   GridFS, and :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` assumes that this reflects the name the
   file has on the local file system. If the local filename is
   different use the :option:`mongofiles --local` option.

.. describe:: get <filename>

   Copy the specified file from GridFS storage to the local file
   system.

   Here, ``<filename>`` refers to the name the object will have in
   GridFS, and :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` assumes that this reflects the name the
   file has on the local file system. If the local filename is
   different use the :option:`mongofiles --local` option.

.. describe:: delete <filename>

   Delete the specified file from GridFS storage.

Examples
--------

To return a list of all files in a :term:`GridFS` collection in the
``records`` database, use the following invocation at the system shell:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles -d records list

This :binary:`~bin.mongofiles` instance will connect to the
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance running on the ``27017`` localhost
interface to specify the same operation on a different port or
hostname, and issue a command that resembles one of the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles --port 37017 -d records list
   mongofiles --hostname db1.example.net -d records list
   mongofiles --hostname db1.example.net --port 37017 -d records list

Modify any of the following commands as needed if you're connecting
the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances on different ports or hosts.

To upload a file named ``32-corinth.lp`` to the GridFS collection in
the ``records`` database, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles -d records put 32-corinth.lp

To delete the ``32-corinth.lp`` file from this GridFS collection in
the ``records`` database, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles -d records delete 32-corinth.lp

To search for files in the GridFS collection in the ``records``
database that have the string ``corinth`` in their names, you can use
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles -d records search corinth

To list all files in the GridFS collection in the ``records`` database
that begin with the string ``32``, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles -d records list 32

To fetch the file from the GridFS collection in the ``records``
database named ``32-corinth.lp``, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongofiles -d records get 32-corinth.lp
