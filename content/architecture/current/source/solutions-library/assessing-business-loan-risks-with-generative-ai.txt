Solution Overview
-----------------

Business loans are a cornerstone of banking operations, providing significant benefits to
both financial institutions and broader economies. For example, in 2023 the value of
commercial and industrial loans in the United States reached nearly `$2.8 trillion
<https://www.statista.com/statistics/214166/commercial-and-industrial-loans-at-commercial-banks-in-the-us/>`__.
However, these loans can present unique challenges and risks that banks must navigate.
Besides credit risk, where the borrower may default, banks also face business risk, in
which economic downturns or sector-specific declines can impact borrowers' ability to
repay loans. This solution dives into the potential of `generative AI
<https://www.mongodb.com/basics/generative-ai>`__ (gen AI) to facilitate detailed risk assessments
for business loans, and how MongoDB's multimodal features can be leveraged for
comprehensive and multidimensional risk analyses.

The code to demonstrate all the features of MongoDB for building this solution 
is available in the following `GitHub repo 
<https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/Risk-assessor>`__.

The Critical Business Plan
---------------------------

A business plan is essential for securing a business loan as it serves as a comprehensive
roadmap detailing the borrower's plans, strategies, and financial projections. It helps
lenders evaluate the business's goals, viability, and profitability, demonstrating how the
loan will be used for growth and repayment. A detailed business plan includes market
analysis, competitive positioning, operational plans, and financial forecasts that build a
compelling case for the lender's investment and the business’s ability to manage risks
effectively, increasing the likelihood of securing the loan.

Reading through borrower credit information and detailed business plans (roughly 15-20
pages long) poses significant challenges for loan officers due to time constraints, the
material’s complexity, and the difficulty of extracting key metrics from detailed
financial projections, market analyses, and risk factors. Navigating technical details and
industry-specific jargon can also be challenging and require specialized knowledge.
Identifying critical risk factors and mitigation strategies only adds further complexity
along with ensuring accuracy and consistency among loan officers and approval committees.

To overcome these challenges, gen AI can assist loan officers by efficiently analyzing
business plans, extracting essential information, identifying key risks, and providing
consistent interpretations, thereby facilitating informed decision-making.

Assessing Loans with Generative AI
----------------------------------

Interactive Risk Analysis with Generative AI-powered Chatbots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Figure 1** below shows an example of how `ChatGPT-4o 
<https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/>`__ responds when asked to assess the risk of a 
business loan. Although the input of the loan purpose and business description is 
simplistic, Generative AI can offer a detailed analysis.

Hallucinations or Ignorance?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By applying Generative AI to risk assessments, lenders can explore additional risk factors 
that Generative AI can evaluate. One factor could be the risk of natural disasters or 
broader climate risks. In **Figure 2**, we added flood risk specifically as a factor to the 
previous question to see what the ChatGPT-4o comes back with.

.. figure:: /includes/images/industry-solutions/chatGPT-flood-risk-assessment.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Figure 2: Example of how ChatGPT-4o responded to flood risk as a factor

   Figure 2. Example of a ChatGPT-4.0 response to flood risk as a factor

Based on the response, there is a low risk of flooding. To validate this, we asked 
ChatGPT-4o the question differently, focusing on its knowledge of flood data. (See **Figure 
3**.) It suggested reviewing FEMA flood maps and local flood history, indicating it might 
not have the latest information.

.. figure:: /includes/images/industry-solutions/GPT-flood-location-specific-answer-png.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Figure 3: Asking location-specific flood questions

   Figure 3. Example of location-specific flood question

In the query shown, ChatGPT-4o gave an opposite answer and indicated there is “significant
flooding” providing references to flood evidence after having performed an internet search
across four sites, which it did not perform previously.

From this example, we can see that when ChatGPT-4o does not have the relevant data, it 
starts to make false claims that can be considered hallucinations. Initially, it indicated 
a low flood risk due to a lack of information. However, when specifically asked about flood 
risk in the second query, it suggested reviewing external sources like FEMA flood maps, 
recognizing its limitations and need for external validation.

Gen AI-powered chatbots can recognize and intelligently seek additional data 
sources to fill their knowledge gaps. However, a causal web search won’t provide the level 
of detail required.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (|rag|) Risk Analysis
----------------------------------------------------

The promising example above demonstrates the experience of how gen AI can augment the
expertise of loan officers for analyzing business loans. However, interacting with a gen AI
chatbot relies on loan officers repeatedly prompting and augmenting the context with
relevant information. This can be time-consuming and impractical due to the lack of prompt
engineering skills or the lack of data needed.

Below is a simplified solution of how gen AI can be used to augment the risk analysis
process and fill the knowledge gap of the |llm|. This demo uses MongoDB as an `operational
data store
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/implementing-an-operational-data-layer>`_
leveraging `geospatial queries <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/geospatial-queries/>`_
to discover floods within five kilometers of the proposed business location. The prompting
for this risk analysis highlights the analysis of the flood risk assessment rather than
the financial projections.

A similar test was performed on `Llama 3 <https://llama.meta.com/llama3/>`_, hosted by our 
`MAAP <https://www.mongodb.com/services/consulting/ai-applications-program>`_  partner  
`Fireworks.AI <https://fireworks.ai/>`_. It tested the model’s knowledge of flood data, 
showing a similar knowledge gap as ChatGPT-4o. Interestingly, rather than providing 
misleading answers, Llama 3 provided a “hallucinated list of flood data,” but highlighted 
that “this data is **fictional and for demonstration purposes** only. In reality, you would 
need to access reliable sources such as FEMA's flood data or other government agencies' 
reports to obtain accurate information.”

   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Figure 4: LLM’s response with fictional flood locations 

   Figure 4. LLM response to fictional flood locations 

With this consistent demonstration of the knowledge gap in the LLMs for specialized areas, 
it reinforces the need to explore how RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) with a multimodal 
data platform can help.

In this simplified demo, you select a business location, a business purpose, and a 
description of a business plan. To make inputs easier, an “Example” button has been added 
to leverage gen AI to generate a sample brief business description to avoid the need to 
type the description template from scratch.

   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Figure 5: Choosing a location on the map and writing a brief plan description 

   Figure 5. User input for the loan risk assessment demonstration

Upon submission, it will provide an analysis using `RAG 
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/basics/retrieval-augmented-generation>`_ with the 
appropriate prompt engineering to provide a simplified analysis of the business with the 
consideration of the location and also the flood risk earlier downloaded from external 
flood data sources.

In the Flood Risk Assessment section, gen AI-powered geospatial analytics enable loan 
officers to quickly discover historical flood occurrences and identify the data sources.

You can also reveal all the sample flood locations within the vicinity of the business 
location selected by clicking on the “Pin” icon. The geolocation pins include the flood 
location and the blue circle indicates the five-kilometer radius in which flood data is 
queried.

   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: Figure 7: Flood locations displayed with pins 

   Figure 7. Flood locations displayed in the demo

To illustrate the ease in fetching the flood locations (using the flood data containing 
geo-locations loaded to MongoDB) around a given coordinate, below is a sample snippet of 
the geospatial query code. In this example, the :manual:`$geoNear 
</reference/operator/aggregation/geoNear/>` command is 
used, which allows one to fetch all the locations that are “near” a given point that is 
specified by the longitude and latitude (e.g., the business location) and also within a 
certain distance (e.g., five km). The geospatial query can be processed in MongoDB’s data 
`aggregation pipeline 
<https://www.mongodb.com/resources/products/capabilities/aggregation-pipeline>`_ to also 
include other data processing such as selecting which data field to be returned from the 
dataset by :manual:`$project 
</reference/operator/aggregation/project/>` and also 
filter based on certain conditions via :manual:`$match 
</reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` (e.g., data 
where the year is greater than 2016). This data is pulled from the `United States Flood 
Database <https://zenodo.org/records/7545697>`_, which contains multiple sources, with 
2020 as the latest dataset.

.. code-block:: python

   pipeline = [
       {"$geoNear": {"near": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [longitude, latitude]},
                     "distanceField": "DISTANCE", "spherical": True, "maxDistance": radius * 1000}},
       {"$project": {"year": 1, "COORD": 1, "DISTANCE": 1}},
       {"$match": {"year": {"$gte": 2016}}}
   ]

Reference Architectures

The following diagram provides a logical architecture overview of the RAG data process
implemented in this solution highlighting the different technologies used including
MongoDB, Meta Llama 3, and Fireworks.AI.

With MongoDB's multimodal capabilities, developers can enhance the RAG process by
utilizing features such as network graphs, time series, and vector search. This enriches
the context for the gen AI agent, enabling it to provide more comprehensive and
multidimensional risk analysis through multimodal analytics. It can provide more accurate
and context-aware insights (eg. using geospatial data to identify flood risk locations) to
reduce hallucination and offer profound insights to augment a complex business loan risk
assessment process.

Due to the iterative nature of the RAG process, the gen AI model will continually learn
and improve from new data and feedback, leading to increasingly accurate risk assessments
and minimizing hallucinations. A multimodal data platform would allow you to to fully
maximize the capabilities of the multimodal AI models.
