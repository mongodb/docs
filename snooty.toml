    As of May 14th, 2025, Motor has been sunset in favor of the GA release of the PyMongo Async API in Pymongo. \
    No new features will be added to Motor. Motor will be deprecated on May 14th, 2026, \
    and no further bug fixes will be released after deprecation, with the exception of critical bug fixes, which will be released until May 14th, 2027. \
    We strongly recommend that Motor users migrate to PyMongo Async while Motor is still supported. \
    To learn how to migrate from Motor to the PyMongo Async API, see the \
    `Migrate to PyMongo Async guide <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/python/pymongo-driver/current/reference/migration/>`__.
