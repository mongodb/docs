                     #. Copy the Homebrew command from the |service| UI
                        window and run it in a terminal.

                     #. Run the following command in a terminal to
                        extract the |mongo| shell:

                        .. code-block:: sh

                           tar -xzf ./<filename>.tgz

                     #. Add the ``bin`` directory to your ``PATH``
                        environment variable.

                        .. code-block:: sh

                           export PATH=/<extraction-directory>/bin:$PATH

                        .. note::

                           If you run this command, it persists for the
                           current shell session. To update the
                           variable across shell sessions and reboots,
                           edit the ``PATH`` environment variable in

                     #. Paste the |mongo| command and connection string
                        into a terminal. Run the command. The shell
                        prompts you for the
                        :manual:`password </reference/program/mongo/#cmdoption-mongo-password>`.

            1. Select your shell version from the dropdown menu. To
               check which version of the |mongo| shell is installed on
               your system, run the following command from a terminal:

               .. code-block:: sh

                  mongo --version

               If your shell version is older than 3.4, MongoDB
               recommends that you upgrade to the newest version.

            #. *Step 2* of the |service| UI modal displays a copyable
               connection string. This string includes the name of the
               MongoDB user that can authenticate with the cluster. Copy
               this string. To connect as a different MongoDB user,
               change the :manual:`--username </reference/program/mongo/#cmdoption-mongo-username>`
               option.

            #. Paste the |mongo| command and connection string into a
               terminal. Run the command. The shell prompts you for the
               :manual:`password </reference/program/mongo/#cmdoption-mongo-password>`.

               - For shell version 3.6 or later, the shell prompts you
                 for the :manual:`password </reference/program/mongo/#cmdoption-mongo-password>`.

               - For shell version 3.4 or earlier, the connection
                 string includes the
                 :manual:`--password </reference/program/mongo/#cmdoption-mongo-password>` option. Edit the
                 placeholder value for the option.
