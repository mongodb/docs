.. note::

   Wait for the Queryable Snapshot to mount before you
   continue. Snapshot mount time depends on the size of the
   snapshot. Verify the snapshot is mounted by navigating to
   :guilabel:`Continuous Backup` and selecting the :guilabel:`Restore
   History` tab. When the snapshot is mounted, the :guilabel:`Status`
   column reports the date and time of the mount operation.
