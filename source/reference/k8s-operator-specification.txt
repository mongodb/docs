Each |k8s-mdbrsc| uses an object specification in |yaml| to define the
characteristics and settings of the MongoDB object: standalone,
:manual:`replica set </reference/glossary/#std-term-replica-set>`, and :manual:`sharded cluster </reference/glossary/#std-term-sharded-cluster>`.

Common Resource Settings
------------------------

Every resource type must use the following settings:

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.metricsPath

   *Type*: string

   *Optional*

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.passwordSecretRef.key

   *Type*: string

   *Optional*

   *Default*: ``"password"``

   Human-readable string that indentifies the key in the |k8s-secret| 
   that stores the password for basic HTTP authentication. If you don't 
   specify this setting, the default applies.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.passwordSecretRef.name

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Human-readable label that identifies the |k8s-secret| that contains 
   the password for basic HTTP authentication. If you want to use 
   Prometheus with your MongoDB resource, you must specify this setting.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.port

   *Type*: integer

   *Optional*

   *Default:* 9216

   Number that identifies the port that the metrics endpoint will 
   bind to. If you don't specify this setting, the default applies.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.tlseSecretKeyRef

   *Type*: object

   *Optional*

   Object that contains the details of the |k8s-secret| for |tls| 
   authentication.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.tlseSecretKeyRef.key

   *Type*: string

   *Optional*

   *Default*: ``"password"``

   Human-readable string that indentifies the key in the |k8s-secret|

   specify this setting, the default applies.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.tlseSecretKeyRef.name

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Human-readable label that identifies the |k8s-secret| that contains

   Prometheus with your MongoDB resource and you want to use |tls| 
   authentication, you must specify this setting.

.. setting:: spec.prometheus.username

   *Type*: string

   *Conditional*

   Human-readable label that identifies the user for basic HTTP 
   authentication. If you want to use Prometheus with your MongoDB 
   resource, you must specify this setting.

            :language: yaml

.. _statefulset-settings:

StatefulSet Settings
--------------------

The following |k8s-statefulsets| settings apply only to replica set and
sharded cluster resource types.

.. setting:: spec.statefulSet.spec

   *Type*: collection

   Specification for the |k8s-statefulset| that the |k8s-op| creates
   for |k8s-mdbrscs|.

.. setting:: spec.statefulSet.spec.serviceName

   *Type*: string

   *Default*: ``<resource_name>-svc`` and ``<resource_name>-svc-external``

   Name of the |k8s| service to be created or used for a |k8s-statefulset|.
   If the service with this name already exists, the |k8s-op-full| doesn't
   delete or recreate it. This setting lets you create your own custom
   services and lets the |k8s-op-short| reuse them.
