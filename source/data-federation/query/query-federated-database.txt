You can use the MongoDB Query Language (MQL) on {+adf+} to query and 
analyze data on your data store. {+adf+} supports most, but not all
standard server commands. To learn more about the supported and 
unsupported MongoDB server commands and aggregation pipleline stages, 
see :ref:`adf-mql-support`.

To query data on your data store, your {+fdi+} storage 
:ref:`configuration <config-adf>` must 
contain settings that define:

- Your {+fdi+} store. 
- {+FDI+} virtual databases and collections that map to your 
  {+fdi+} store.

You can create or update your {+fdi+} :ref:`storage configuration 
<config-adf>` for your data store using the {+atlas-ui+} 
:guilabel:`Visual Editor` or :guilabel:`JSON Editor`, {+adf+} :ref:`CLI 
<adf-cli>` commands, and {+adf+} :oas-atlas-tag:`API </Data-Federation>`
endpoints. To learn more about {+fdi+} storage configuration, see
:ref:`config-adf`.  

{+adf+} creates the virtual databases and collections you specified in 
your {+fdi+} configuration for the data in your data store. When you 
:doc:`connect </data-federation/tutorial/connect>` to your {+fdi+} and 
:doc:`run queries </data-federation/tutorial/run-queries>`, {+adf+} 
processes your queries against the data and returns the query results.
You can, optionally, configure :ref:`limits <adf-query-limits>` on the
amount of data that {+adf+} processes for your queries to control costs. 

.. note::  

   {+adf+} uses columnar storage that doesn't preserve the order of
   fields within documents. Therefore, {+adf+} doesn't support queries
   that are field-order sensitive, such as an :manual:`embedded document
   equality query </reference/operator/query/eq/#field-in-embedded-document-equals-a-value>` 
   or sorting on a document field.

A database user must have one of the following roles to run queries 
against a {+fdi+}:

- :atlas:`readWriteAnyDatabase </security-add-mongodb-users/#readWriteAnyDatabase>`

- :atlas:`readAnyDatabase </security-add-mongodb-users/#readAnyDatabase>`

- A :atlas:`custom role </security-add-mongodb-roles/>` with the  
  :manual:`find </reference/privilege-actions/>` privilege for the
  :manual:`namespace </reference/limits/#namespaces>` against which you
  want to run queries 

You can run up to 30 simultaneous queries on your {+fdi+} against:

- Data in your |s3| bucket or {+az-bs+} container.
- Documents in your MongoDB |service| cluster.
- Archived data in your {+Online-Archive+}.
- Data in files hosted at publicly accessible |url|\s.

.. see:: 

   - :doc:`How to Connect to Your Federated Database Instance </data-federation/tutorial/connect>`
   - :doc:`How to Run Queries Against Your Data Using Your Federated 
     Database Instance </data-federation/tutorial/run-queries>`

The following sections contain information pertaining to running 
queries against data in your data store.

.. _query-s3:

Querying Data on S3 
-------------------

When :doc:`deploying </data-federation/tutorial/deploy>` your {+fdi+}, 
if you specified an |s3| bucket with both read and write permissions or 
|aws| |s3| :aws:`s3:PutObject </AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-objects>` 
permission, you can also save your query results in your |s3| bucket 
using :ref:`adf-out-stage` to |s3|.

If you successfully create or update an object on your |s3| data store, 
{+df+} returns the latest version of that object for any subsequent 
read requests and all list operations of the objects also reflect the 
changes. If your query contains multiple stages, each stage receives 
the most recent data available from the data store as that stage is 
processed.

.. _query-azure-container:

Querying Data on {+az-bs+}  
------------------------------------

When :doc:`deploying </data-federation/tutorial/deploy>` your {+fdi+}, 
you can specify an {+az-bs+} container with both read and write
permissions. 

.. include:: /includes/data-federation/fact-partition-cost-benefit.rst 

Querying Data on {+gcs+}
--------------------------------------

When :doc:`deploying </data-federation/tutorial/deploy>` your {+fdi+},
you can specify a {+gcs+} bucket with both read and write permissions.

.. include:: /includes/data-federation/fact-partition-cost-benefit.rst 

.. _query-atlas:

Querying Data in Your |service| Cluster 
---------------------------------------

When you run queries against your |service| {+cluster+} through your
{+fdi+}, {+adf+} sets the ``appName``, when querying your {+cluster+},
based on the ``appName`` that you used to connect to your {+fdi+}. For
example, if you connect to your {+fdi+} with ``appName`` set to
``myApp`` (i.e. ``appName = "myApp"``), {+adf+} sets the ``appName``
when connecting to your {+cluster+} to the following:  

.. code-block:: shell 
   :copyable: false 

   atlas-data-federation|myApp

If you query a collection in {+adf+} that is mapped to only one 
|service| collection, {+adf+} acts as a proxy and forwards your query 
to |service|. When acting as a proxy, {+adf+} doesn't scan data into 
its virtual collection to process the query thus improving performance 
and reducing cost. This optimization is not available for queries on 
{+adf+} collections that are mapped to multiple |service| collections. 

.. example:: 

   Consider the following {+fdi+} storage configuration: 

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "stores" : [
          {
            "name" : "atlas-store",
            "provider": "atlas",
            "clusterName": "myCluster", 
            "projectId": "5e2211c17a3e5a48f5497de3"
          }
        ],
        "databases" : [
          {
            "name" : "atlas-db",
            "collections" : [
              {
                "name" : "foo",
                "dataSources" : [
                  {
                    "storeName" : "atlas-store",
                    "database" : "myFooData",
                    "collection" : "foo" 
                  }
                ]
              },
              {
                "name" : "barbaz",
                "dataSources" : [
                  {
                    "storeName" : "atlas-store",
                    "database" : "myBarData",
                    "collection" : "bar" 
                  },
                  {
                    "storeName" : "atlas-store",
                    "database" : "myBazData",
                    "collection" : "baz" 
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }

   For the above storage configuration, {+adf+} acts as a proxy for 
   queries on ``foo`` collection and forwards the queries to |service|. 
   This performance and cost optimization is not available for queries 
   on ``barbaz`` collection because ``barbaz`` is mapped to multiple 
   |service| collections.

You can also save your query results in your |service| {+cluster+} using 
:ref:`adf-out-stage` to |service|.

If you successfully create or update a document in your collection on 
the |service| {+cluster+}, {+df+} returns the latest version of that 
document for any subsequent read requests and all list operations of 
the collection also reflect the changes. If your query contains 
multiple stages, each stage receives the most recent data available 
from the data store as that stage is processed.

|service| logs your queries against your {+cluster+} data in the |service| 
{+cluster+} audit logs. The log entry for a database user is in the 
following format: 

.. code-block:: sh 
   :copyable: false 

   <SERVICE_NAME>-<CUSTOMER_DATA_LAKE_NAME>-<DATABASE_USER_NAME>

For example, for a database user configured in |service| as 
``"user" : "CN=atlasDataLake-DataLake0-test_datalake0"``, a log entry in 
the |service| {+cluster+} audit log looks similar to the following:

.. code-block:: sh
   :copyable: false 
   :emphasize-lines: 6, 8

   { 
     "atype" : "authenticate", 
     "ts" : { "$date" : "2022-04-29T13:17:54.020+00:00" }, 
     "local" : { "ip" : "XXXX", "port" : 27017 }, 
     "remote" : { "ip" : "XXXXX", "port" : 10844 }, 
     "users" : [ { "user" : "CN=atlasDataLake-DataLake0-test_datalake0", "db" : "$external" } ], 
     "roles" : [ { "role" : "backup", "db" : "admin" }, { "role" : "readWriteAnyDatabase", "db" : "admin" }, { "role" : "clusterMonitor", "db" : "admin" }, { "role" : "enableSharding", "db" : "admin" }, { "role" : "atlasAdmin", "db" : "admin" }, { "role" : "dbAdminAnyDatabase", "db" : "admin" } ], 
     "param" : { "user" : "CN=atlasDataLake-DataLake0-test_datalake0", "db" : "$external", "mechanism" : "MONGODB-X509" }, 
     "result" : 0 
   } 

.. note:: 

   The connection mechanism is always ``MONGODB-X509`` in the |service| 
   {+cluster+} audit logs.

.. _query-oa:

Querying Data in Your {+Online-Archive+}s 
-----------------------------------------

For queries, {+adf+} uses the partitions that you created on fields
during the creation of the |service| {+Online-Archive+}. The order of
fields in the partitions is important in the same way as it is for
:manual:`Compound Indexes </core/index-compound/>`. Data is optimized
for queries by the first field, followed by the second field, and so on.
{+adf+} parses the partitions in order; if a query omits a particular
partition, {+adf+} is less efficient in making use of any partitions
that follow the omitted partition.  

{+adf+} is less performant in supporting queries on fields that don't 
have partitions. 

.. _query-http:

Querying Data at a |http| or |https| |url| 
------------------------------------------

{+df+} also creates one partition for each |url| in your collection. 
When you :doc:`connect </data-federation/tutorial/connect>` to your 
{+fdi+} and run queries, {+df+} processes your queries against the data 
and returns the query results.

.. _federated-queries:

Running Federated Queries 
-------------------------

You can use {+adf+} to query and analyze a unified view of data in your 
|service| cluster, |s3| bucket or {+az-bs+} container, |http| URL, and
online archives. For federated queries, your {+fdi+} storage
:ref:`configuration <config-adf>` must contain the settings that define: 

- Your |s3| or |azure|, |service|, {+Online-Archive+}, and |http| stores.

  .. note:: 

     {+adf+} doesn't support federated queries across cloud providers.
     Therefore, you can't run federated queries against data stored on
     |aws| |s3| buckets and {+az-bs+} containers. Regardless of the
     cloud provider backing your |service| {+cluster+}, you can run
     federated queries against data on your |service| {+cluster+} and
     |aws| |s3| bucket or {+az-bs+} container simultaneously. 

- {+FDI+}\s with virtual collections that map to your |s3| bucket or
  {+az-bs+}, |service| {+cluster+}, {+Online-Archive+}, and |http|
  stores. 

You can create or update your {+fdi+} :ref:`storage configuration 
<config-adf>` using the {+atlas-ui+} :guilabel:`Visual Editor` or 
the :guilabel:`JSON Editor`, {+adf+} :ref:`CLI 
<adf-cli>` commands, and {+adf+} :oas-atlas-tag:`API </Data-Federation>`
endpoints. To learn more about {+fdi+} storage configuration, see
:ref:`config-adf`. 

When you :doc:`connect </data-federation/tutorial/connect>` to your 
{+fdi+} and run federated queries, {+df+} combines data from your 
|service| cluster, |s3| bucket or {+az-bs+} container, and |http|
|url|\s in virtual databases and collections and returns a union of data
in the results.  

.. _adf-query-limits:

Configuring Query Limits 
------------------------

You can limit the amount of data that {+adf+} processes for your queries
to control costs. To limit the amount of data that {+adf+} processes for
your queries, you can configure query limits per {+fdi+} or for all
{+fdi+}\s in your project. When the amount of processed data reaches any
applicable configured limit, {+adf+} won't execute any new queries and 
returns an error to the client application that a limit has been reached. 
To learn more, see :ref:`adf-manage-query-limits`. 

.. _query-troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting 
---------------

**Error:** We are currently experiencing increased query processing 
wait times for {+adf+}. Our Engineering team is investigating. Normal 
service will resume shortly, please try again.

{+adf+} returns this error only when {+adf+} can't execute queries 
because of resource contention. We recommend that you run your queries 
again.
