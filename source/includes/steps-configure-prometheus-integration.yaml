          to spin up a ``https`` Prometheus scraping endpoint. 

          .. note::

             You are responsible for the following:
             
             - TLS Certificate Key File issuance and renewal.
             - Checking if the endpoint started correctly in the automation agent logs.

     * - Discovery Method
       - Description

     * - `HTTP SD <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/http_sd/>`__
       - This method requires Prometheus v2.28 and later. It
         automatically generates the `scrape_config
         <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config>`__
         part of your `configuration file
         <https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#configuration-file>`__
         to discover targets over an HTTP endpoint.

     * - `File Service Discovery <https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/file-sd/#use-file-based-service-discovery-to-discover-scrape-targets>`__
       - This method allows Prometheus to read YAML or JSON documents to
         configure the targets to scrape from. You are responsible for
         providing the targets by making a request to the
         :ref:`Discovery API <prometheus-discovery-endpoint-mms>` and
         storing its results in a ``targets.json`` file.

         To make the request, substitute the placeholder text in one of
         the following tabs or create your own script in another language.

         .. tabs::

           .. tab:: Shell Command
              :tabid: shell-command

              .. code-block:: sh

                 curl --header 'Accept: application/json' 
                 # Sets the `Authorization` header on every scrape request with the
                 # username and password from the previous step.
                 --user <username>:<password> 
                 # The URL that Prometheus fetches the targets from. 
                 # Replace the <group-id> with the project ID of your Atlas instance.
                 --request GET "https://cloud.mongodb.com/prometheus/v1.0/groups/<group_id>/discovery" 

           .. tab:: Python Script
              :tabid: python-script

              .. tip::

                 If you need to install the ``requests`` library, see their
                 `Installation Guide <https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/>`__.

              .. code-block:: python

                 import time, json, requests

                 # This script sets the `Authorization` header on every
                 # scrape request with the configured username and
                 # password. Then it tells Prometheus to fetch targets
                 # from the specified URL. 
                 #
                 # Note: Replace the <username> and <password> with the
                 # values in the previous step, and <group-id> with the
                 # project ID of your Atlas instance.

                 # The script updates your targets.json file every
                 # minute, if it successfully retrieves targets.
                 #
                 # Note: Replace the <path-to-targets.json> with the
                 # path to your targets.json file.
                 starttime = time.time()
                 while True:
                   r = requests.get(discovery_api_url, auth=(basic_auth_user, basic_auth_password))
                   if  r.status_code == 200:
                     with open('<path-to-targets.json>', 'w') as f:
                       json.dump(r.json(), f)
                   time.sleep(60.0 - ((time.time() - starttime) % 60.0))
