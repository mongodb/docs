Pronouns are useful, but you must make sure that their antecedents (the
words that the pronouns replace) are clear, and that the pronouns don’t
cause vagueness and ambiguity.

The following pronouns often cause problems, so use them carefully:
*it*, *this*, *there*, and *that*.

It
~~

Make sure that the antecedent of *it* is clear. If multiple singular
nouns precede *it*, any of them could be the antecedent.

Avoid using *it is* (or *it's*) to begin a sentence. Such a
construction hides the real subject of the sentence.

     - The product stores the value in the configuration file. You can

       the value, or the file.)

This
~~~~

Avoid beginning a sentence with the pronoun *this*, unless you follow
*this* with a noun to clarify its meaning.

There
~~~~~

Avoid using *there is* and *there are* as the subject of a sentence or
clause. Using *there* shifts the focus away from the real subject and
often uses unnecessary words.

     - The FTP service supports resumable uploading. This means that if
       there is a connection failure during an upload, it doesn't have
       to be started from the beginning.

That
~~~~

Although you should use *that* as a relative pronoun (see
:ref:`use-that-which-correctly`), avoid using it as a demonstrative
pronoun (which stands in for or points to a noun). Use it as
an adjective and follow it with a noun.
