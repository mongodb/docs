Backup Databases Using Binary Database Dumps
============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This section describes the process for writing the entire contents of
your MongoDB instance to a file in a binary format. If
disk-level snapshots are not available, this approach
provides the best option for full system database backups.

.. seealso::

   The :doc:`/reference/mongodump` and :doc:`/reference/mongorestore`
   documents contain complete documentation of these tools. If you
   have questions about these tools not covered here, please refer to
   these documents.

   If your system has disk level snapshot capabilities, consider the
   backup methods described in :doc:`/tutorial/backup-databases-with-filesystem-snapshots`.

Database Dump with ``mongodump``
--------------------------------

The :program:`mongodump` utility can perform a live backup of data or
can work against an inactive set of database files.
The :program:`mongodump` utility can create a dump for an entire
server/database/collection (or part of a collection using of query),
even when the database is running and active. If you run
:program:`mongodump` without any arguments, the command connects to
the local database instance (e.g. ``127.0.0.1`` or ``localhost``) and
creates a database backup named ``dump/`` in the current directory.

.. include:: /includes/note-mongodump-compatibility-2.2.rst

To limit the amount of data included in the database dump, you can
specify :option:`--database <mongodump --database>` and
:option:`--collection <mongodump --collection>` as options to the
:program:`mongodump` command. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodump --collection collection --db test

This command creates a dump of the collection named ``collection``
from the database ``test`` in a :file:`dump/` subdirectory of the current
working directory.

Use the :option:`--oplog <mongodump --oplog>` option with
:program:`mongodump` to collect the :term:`oplog` entries to build a
point-in-time snapshot of a database within a replica set. With :option:`--oplog
<mongodump --oplog>`, :program:`mongodump` copies all the data from
the source database as well as all of the :term:`oplog` entries from
the beginning of the backup procedure to until the backup procedure
completes. This backup procedure, in conjunction with
:option:`mongorestore --oplogReplay <mongorestore --oplogReplay>`,
allows you to restore a backup that reflects a consistent and specific
moment in time.

If your MongoDB instance is not running, you can use the
:option:`--dbpath <mongodump --dbpath>` option to specify the
location to your MongoDB instance's database files. :program:`mongodump`
reads from the data files directly with this operation. This
locks the data directory to prevent conflicting writes. The
:program:`mongod` process must *not* be running or attached to these
data files when you run :program:`mongodump` in this
configuration. Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodump --dbpath /srv/mongodb

Additionally, the :option:`--host <mongodump --host>` and
:option:`--port <mongodump --port>` options allow you to specify a
non-local host to connect to capture the dump. Consider the following
example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongodump --host mongodb1.example.net --port 3017 --username user --password pass --out /opt/backup/mongodump-2011-10-24

On any :program:`mongodump` command you may, as above, specify username
and password credentials to specify database authentication.

Restore Database from Binary Dump with ``mongorestore``
-------------------------------------------------------

The :program:`mongorestore` utility restores a binary backup created by
:program:`mongodump`. Consider the following example command:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongorestore dump-2011-10-25/

Here, :program:`mongorestore` imports the database backup located in
the :file:`dump-2011-10-25` directory to the :program:`mongod` instance
running on the localhost interface. By default, :program:`mongorestore`
looks for a database dump in the :file:`dump/` directory and restores
that. If you wish to restore to a non-default host, the
:option:`--host <mongorestore --host>` and :option:`--port <mongorestore --port>`
options allow you to specify a non-local host to connect to capture
the dump. Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongorestore --host mongodb1.example.net --port 3017 --username user --password pass /opt/backup/mongodump-2011-10-24

On any :program:`mongorestore` command you may specify
username and password credentials, as above.

If you created your database dump using the :option:`--oplog
<mongodump --oplog>` option to ensure a point-in-time snapshot, call
:program:`mongorestore` with the
:option:`--oplogReplay <mongorestore --oplogReplay>`
option, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongorestore --oplogReplay

You may also consider using the :option:`mongorestore --objcheck`
option to check the integrity of objects while inserting them into the
database, or you may consider the :option:`mongorestore --drop` option to drop each
collection from the database before restoring from
backups. :program:`mongorestore` also includes the ability to a filter
to all input before inserting it into the new database. Consider the
following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongorestore --filter '{"field": 1}'

Here, :program:`mongorestore` only adds documents to the database from
the dump located in the :file:`dump/` folder *if* the documents have a
field name ``field`` that holds a value of ``1``. Enclose the
filter in single quotes (e.g. ``'``) to prevent the filter from
interacting with your shell environment.

.. code-block:: sh

   mongorestore --dbpath /srv/mongodb --journal

Here, :program:`mongorestore` restores the database dump located in
:file:`dump/` folder into the data files located at :file:`/srv/mongodb`.
Additionally,
the :option:`--journal <mongorestore --journal>` option ensures that
:program:`mongorestore` records all operation in the durability
:term:`journal`. The journal prevents data file corruption if anything
(e.g. power failure, disk failure, etc.)  interrupts the restore
operation.

   :doc:`/reference/mongorestore`.
