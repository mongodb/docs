The map-reduce operation is composed of many tasks, including reads
from the input collection, executions of the ``map`` function,
executions of the ``reduce`` function, writes to a temporary collection
during processing, and writes to the output collection.

During the operation, map-reduce takes the following locks:

- The read phase takes a read lock.  It yields every 100 documents.

- The insert into the temporary collection takes a write lock for a
  single write.

- If the output collection does not exist, the creation of the output
  collection takes a write lock.

- If the output collection exists, then the output actions (i.e.
  ``merge``, ``replace``, ``reduce``) take a write lock. This write
  lock is *global*, and blocks all operations on the :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  instance.

.. note::
   The final write lock during post-processing makes the results appear
   atomically. However, output actions ``merge`` and ``reduce`` may
   take minutes to process. For the ``merge`` and ``reduce``, the
   ``nonAtomic`` flag is available, which releases the lock between
   writing each output
   document. See the :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` reference for more
   information.
