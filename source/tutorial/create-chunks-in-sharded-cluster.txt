Pre-splitting the chunk ranges in an empty sharded collection allows
clients to insert data into an already partitioned collection. In most
situations a :term:`sharded cluster` will create and distribute chunks
automatically without user intervention. However, in a limited number
of cases, MongoDB cannot create enough chunks or distribute
data fast enough to support required throughput. For example:

- If you want to partition an existing data collection that resides on a
  single shard.

- If you want to ingest a large volume of data into a cluster that isn't
  balanced, or where the ingestion of data will lead to data imbalance.
  For example, monotonically increasing or decreasing shard keys insert
  all data into a single chunk.

These operations are resource intensive for several reasons:

- Chunk migration requires copying all the data in the chunk from one shard to
  another.

- No shard can participate in more than one migration at any given
  time. To migrate multiple chunks from a shard, the balancer migrates
  the chunks one at a time.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.4 

     Observing the restriction that a shard can participate in at most
     one migration at a time, for a sharded cluster with *n* shards,
     MongoDB can perform at most *n/2* (rounded down) simultaneous
     chunk migrations.

- MongoDB creates splits only after an insert operation.

.. warning::

   Only pre-split an empty collection. If a collection already has data,
   MongoDB automatically splits the collection's data when you enable
   sharding for the collection. Subsequent attempts to manually create
   splits can lead to unpredictable chunk ranges and sizes as well as
   inefficient or ineffective balancing behavior.

To create chunks manually, use the following procedure:

#. Split empty chunks in your collection by manually performing
   the :dbcommand:`split` command on chunks.

   .. example::

      To create chunks for documents in the ``myapp.users``
      collection using the ``email`` field as the :term:`shard key`,
      use the following operation in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

        .. code-block:: javascript

           for ( var x=97; x<97+26; x++ ){
             for( var y=97; y<97+26; y+=6 ) {
               var prefix = String.fromCharCode(x) + String.fromCharCode(y);
               db.adminCommand( { split : "myapp.users" , middle : { email : prefix } } );
             }
           }

      This assumes a collection size of 100 million documents.
