Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to
run :atlas:`Atlas Search </atlas-search/>` queries on a collection.
Atlas Search enables you to perform full-text searches on collections
hosted on MongoDB Atlas. Atlas Search indexes specify the behavior of the
search and which fields to index.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The example in this guide uses the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to
create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Run an Atlas Search Query
-------------------------

This section shows how to create an aggregation pipeline to run an
Atlas Search query on a collection. In your array of pipeline stages,
add the ``$search`` stage to specify the search criteria. Then, call
the ``aggregate()`` method and pass your pipeline array as a parameter.

.. tip:: 

   To learn more about aggregation operations, see the :ref:`node-aggregation`
   guide. 

Before running an Atlas Search query, you must create an Atlas Search index
on your collection. To learn how to programmatically create an Atlas Search
index, see the :ref:`node-indexes-search` section of the Indexes guide. 

Atlas Search Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example runs an Atlas Search query by performing the
following actions:

- Creates a ``$search`` stage that instructs the driver
  to query for documents in which the ``title`` field contains
  the word ``"Alabama"``

- Creates a ``$project`` stage that instructs the driver to
  include the ``title`` field in the query results

- Passes the pipeline stages to the ``aggregate()`` method and
  prints the results
