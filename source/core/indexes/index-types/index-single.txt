Single field indexes store information from a single field in a
collection. By default, all collections have an index on the :ref:`_id
field <index-type-id>`. You can add additional indexes to speed up
important queries and operations.

You can create a single-field index on any field in a document,
including:

- Top-level document fields

- Embedded documents

- Fields within embedded documents

When you create an index, you specify:

- The field on which to create the index.

- The sort order for the indexed values (ascending or descending).

  - A sort order of ``1`` sorts values in ascending order.

  - A sort order of ``-1`` sorts values in descending order.

To create a single-field index, use the following prototype:

.. include:: /includes/indexes/code-examples/create-single-field-index.rst

This image shows an ascending index on a single field, ``score``:

.. include:: /images/index-ascending.rst

In this example, each document in the collection that has a value for
the ``score`` field is added to the index in ascending order.

Use Cases
---------

If your application repeatedly runs queries on the same field, you can
create an index on that field to improve performance. For example, your
human resources department often needs to look up employees by employee
ID. You can create an index on the employee ID field to improve the
performance of that query.

Indexing commonly queried fields increases the chances of :ref:`covering
<indexes-covered-queries>` those queries. Covered queries are queries
that can be satisfied entirely using an index, without examining any
documents. This optimizes query performance.

Get Started
