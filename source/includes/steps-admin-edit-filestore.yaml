      * - Field

        - Contents

      * - :guilabel:`Store Path`

        - The location where file system-based backups are stored on the |onprem| server.

      * - :guilabel:`Assignment Labels`

        - A comma-separated list of labels to assign the filestores to specific groups.

      * - :guilabel:`Load Factor`

        - A proportional value of how backup jobs are assigned to the given
          snapshot store compared to other snapshot stores. 

          By default snapshot stores assign one shard per snapshot store.

          If a snapshot store has more than one shard assigned, it would
          result in one snapshot store being backed up often than the another. 
          This ratio of backup jobs to shards can be changed using the load factor.

          An example of how the Load Factor affects backups:

          You are backing up a 5 shard cluster. Your deployment has filestore
          (A) with one shard and blockstore (B) with four shards. These
          blockstores should not get equally distribution of backup jobs, as B
          is four times larger than A. B should get a Load Factor of 4 and A
          should get a Load Factor or 1.

      * - :guilabel:`Write Concern`

        - Select the proper :manual:`Write Concern</core/write-concern/>`.
