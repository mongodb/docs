.. default-domain:: mongodb

Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. Without
indexes, MongoDB must perform a *collection scan*, i.e. scan every
document in a collection, to select those documents that match the
query statement. If an appropriate index exists for a query,
MongoDB can use the index to limit the number of documents it must
inspect.

Indexes are special data structures [#b-tree]_ that store a small
portion of the collection's data set in an easy to traverse form. The
index stores the value of a specific field or set of fields, ordered by
the value of the field. The ordering of the index entries supports
efficient equality matches and range-based query operations. In
addition, MongoDB can return sorted results by using the ordering in
the index.

The following diagram illustrates a query that selects and orders the
matching documents using an index:

Fundamentally, indexes in MongoDB are similar to indexes in other
database systems. MongoDB defines indexes at the :term:`collection`
level and supports indexes on any field or sub-field of the documents
in a MongoDB collection.

.. _index-type-id:

Default ``_id`` Index
---------------------

MongoDB creates a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>` on the
:ref:`_id <document-id-field>` field during the creation of a
collection. The ``_id`` index prevents clients from inserting two
documents with the same value for the ``_id`` field. You cannot drop
this index.

.. note::

   In :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`, if you do *not* use
   the ``_id`` field as the :term:`shard key`, then your application
   **must** ensure the uniqueness of the values in the ``_id`` field.
   You can do this by using a field with an auto-generated :term:`ObjectId`.

.. _index-names:

Index Names
~~~~~~~~~~~

The default name for an index is the concatenation of the indexed keys
and each key's direction in the index ( i.e. 1 or -1) using underscores
as a separator. For example, an index created on 
``{ item : 1, quantity: -1 }`` has the name ``item_1_quantity_-1``.

You can create indexes with a custom name, such as one that is more 
human-readable than the default. For example, consider an application
that frequently queries the ``products`` collection to populate data on
existing inventory. The following :method:`~db.collection.createIndex()`
method creates an index on ``item`` and ``quantity`` named ``query for
inventory``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.createIndex( 
     { item: 1, quantity: -1 } , 
     { name: "query for inventory" } 
   )

You can view index names using the :method:`db.collection.getIndexes()`
method. You cannot rename an index once created. Instead, you must
drop and re-create the index with a new name. 

.. _index-types:

Index Types
-----------

MongoDB provides a number of different index types to support specific
types of data and queries.

.. _index-intro-single-field:

Single Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the MongoDB-defined ``_id`` index, MongoDB supports the
creation of user-defined ascending/descending indexes on a :doc:`single
field of a document </core/index-single>`.

.. include:: /images/index-ascending.rst

For a single-field index and sort operations, the sort order (i.e.
ascending or descending) of the index key does not matter because
MongoDB can traverse the index in either direction.

See :doc:`/core/index-single` and :ref:`sort-results-single-field` for
more information on single-field indexes.

Compound Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB also supports user-defined indexes on multiple fields, i.e.
:doc:`compound indexes </core/index-compound>`.

The order of fields listed in a compound index has significance. For
instance, if a compound index consists of ``{ userid: 1, score: -1 }``,
the index sorts first by ``userid`` and then, within each ``userid``
value, sorts by ``score``.

.. include:: /images/index-compound-key.rst

For compound indexes and sort operations, the sort order (i.e.
ascending or descending) of the index keys can determine whether the
index can support a sort operation. See
:ref:`index-ascending-and-descending` for more information on the
impact of index order on results in compound indexes.

See also:

- :ref:`index-type-compound`,
- :ref:`sort-on-multiple-fields`, and
- :ref:`esr-indexing-rule` 

Multikey Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB uses :doc:`multikey indexes </core/index-multikey>` to index
the content stored in arrays. If you index a field that holds an array
value, MongoDB creates separate index entries for *every* element of
the array. These :doc:`multikey indexes </core/index-multikey>` allow
queries to select documents that contain arrays by matching on element
or elements of the arrays. MongoDB automatically determines whether to
create a multikey index if the indexed field contains an array value;
you do not need to explicitly specify the multikey type.

.. include:: /images/index-multikey.rst

See :doc:`/core/index-multikey` and :doc:`/core/multikey-index-bounds`
for more information on multikey indexes.

Geospatial Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support efficient queries of geospatial coordinate data, MongoDB
provides two special indexes: :ref:`2d indexes <2d-index>` that uses
planar geometry when returning results and :ref:`2dsphere indexes
<2dsphere-index>` that use spherical geometry to return results.

.. include:: /includes/indexes/sparse-index-considerations.rst

See :ref:`index-feature-geospatial` for a high level introduction to
geospatial indexes.

Text Search Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/indexes/text-search-indexes-overview.rst

.. include:: /includes/indexes/sparse-index-considerations.rst

Hashed Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To support :ref:`hash based sharding <sharding-hashed-sharding>`,
MongoDB provides a :doc:`hashed index </core/index-hashed>` type,
which indexes the hash of the value of a field. These indexes have a
more random distribution of values along their range, but *only*
support equality matches and cannot support range-based queries.

Clustered Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/clustered-collections-introduction.rst

See :ref:`clustered-collections`.

Wildcard Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, you can use wildcard indexes to support
queries against multiple, arbitrary, or unknown fields. When you create
a wildcard index, you specify ``$**`` to represent all fields or all
values, allowing you to index any of the following with a single
command:

- All values of a field
- All fields in a document
- All fields in a document except specific field paths
- Multiple specific fields in a document

To learn more, see :ref:`wildcard-index-core`.

Index Properties
----------------

.. _unique-index:

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`unique <index-type-unique>` property for an index causes
MongoDB to reject duplicate values for the indexed field. Other than
the unique constraint, unique indexes are functionally interchangeable
with other MongoDB indexes.

.. _partial-index:

Partial Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Partial indexes <index-type-partial>` only index the documents in
a collection that meet a specified filter expression. By indexing a
subset of the documents in a collection, partial indexes have lower
storage requirements and reduced performance costs for index creation
and maintenance.

Partial indexes offer a superset of the functionality of sparse indexes
and should be preferred over sparse indexes.

Sparse Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`sparse <index-type-sparse>` property of an index ensures
that the index only contains entries for documents that have the indexed
field. The index skips documents that *do not* have the indexed field.

You can combine the ``sparse`` index option with the ``unique`` index
option to prevent inserting documents that have duplicate values for the
indexed field(s) and skip indexing documents that lack the indexed
field(s).

.. _ttl-index:

TTL Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`TTL indexes <index-feature-ttl>` automatically remove documents
from a collection after a certain amount of time. This is ideal for
certain types of information like machine generated event data, logs,
and session information that only need to persist in a database for a
finite amount of time.

See: :doc:`/tutorial/expire-data` for implementation instructions.

Hidden Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 4.4

:ref:`Hidden indexes <index-type-hidden>` are not visible to the
:doc:`query planner </core/query-plans>` and cannot be used to support
a query.

By hiding an index from the planner, users can evaluate the potential
impact of dropping an index without actually dropping the index. If the
impact is negative, the user can unhide the index instead of having to
recreate a dropped index. And because indexes are fully maintained
while hidden, the indexes are immediately available for use once
unhidden.

Except for the ``_id`` index, you can hide any indexes.

Index Use
---------

Indexes can improve the efficiency of read operations. The
:doc:`/tutorial/analyze-query-plan` tutorial provides an example of the
execution statistics of a query with and without an index.

For information on how MongoDB chooses an index to use, see :ref:`query
optimizer <read-operations-query-optimization>`.

Indexes and Collation
---------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-versionadded.rst

.. include:: /includes/driver-examples/driver-example-indexes-2.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-index-use.rst

For more information on collation, see the :ref:`collation reference
page <collation>`.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/collation-index-type-restrictions.rst

Covered Queries
---------------

When the query criteria and the :term:`projection` of a query include
*only* the indexed fields, MongoDB returns results directly from
the index *without* scanning any documents or bringing documents into
memory. These covered queries can be *very* efficient.

.. include:: /images/index-for-covered-query.rst

For more information on covered queries, see
:ref:`read-operations-covered-query`.

Index Intersection
------------------

MongoDB can use the :doc:`intersection of indexes
</core/index-intersection>` to fulfill queries. For queries that
specify compound query conditions, if one index can fulfill a part of a
query condition, and another index can fulfill another part of the
query condition, then MongoDB can use the intersection of the two
indexes to fulfill the query. Whether the use of a compound index or
the use of an index intersection is more efficient depends on the
particular query and the system.

For details on index intersection, see :doc:`/core/index-intersection`.

Restrictions
------------

Certain restrictions apply to indexes, such as the length of the index
keys or the number of indexes per collection. See :ref:`Index
Limitations <index-limitations>` for details.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Although indexes can improve query performances, indexes also present
some operational considerations. See :ref:`Operational Considerations
for Indexes <data-model-indexes>` for more information.
