This quick start describes how to configure, create, and query a time series 
collection with MongoDB Atlas or a self-managed deployment.

*Time required: 30 minutes*

Sample Data
------------

This quick start creates a ``stocks`` time series collection with the
following document structure.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { 
      _id: ObjectId(...),
      ticker: <string>, 
      date: ISODate(...), 
      close: <double>,
      volume: <double>
   }


Learning Summary
----------------

This quick start focused on creating a new time series collection. Because time
series collections are optimized for time data, their performance depends
heavily on how you configure them at creation. For more information, see
:ref:`Time Series Collection Considerations
<manual-timeseries-considerations>`.


Next Steps
----------

* To migrate existing data into a time series collection, see :ref:`Migrate
  Data into a Time Series Collection 
  <migrate-data-into-a-timeseries-collection>`.

* To shard a time series collection, see :ref:`Shard a Time Series Collection
  <manual-timeseries-shard-collection>`. 

* For aggregation and query behaviors specific to time series
  collections, see :ref:`Aggregation and Operator Considerations 
  <manual-timeseries-aggregations-operators>`.
