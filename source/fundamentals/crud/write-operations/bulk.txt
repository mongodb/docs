Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use bulk operations in the
{+driver-short+}.

To perform a single create, replace, update, or delete operation, you can use
the corresponding method. For example, to insert one document and replace one 
document, you can use the ``insertOne()`` and ``replaceOne()`` methods. When you
use these methods, your client makes one call to the database for each operation. 

By using a bulk write operation, you can perform multiple write operations in
fewer database calls. You can perform bulk write operations at the following levels:

- :ref:`Collection <kotlin-coll-bulk-write>`: You can use the 
  ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method to perform bulk write operations on a 
  single collection. In this method, each kind of write operation requires at
  least one database call. For example, ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` puts multiple update
  operations in one call, but makes two separate calls to the database for an insert
  operation and a replace operation.

- :ref:`Client <kotlin-client-bulk-write>`: If your application connects to
  {+mdb-server+} version 8.0 or later, you can use the ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()``
  method to perform bulk write operations on multiple collections and databases 
  in the same cluster. This method performs all write operations 
  in one database call.

.. _kotlin-coll-bulk-write:

Collection Bulk Write
---------------------

Bulk write operations contain one or more write operations. To perform a bulk 
write operation at the collection level, pass a ``List`` of ``WriteModel`` 
documents to the ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method. A ``WriteModel`` is a 
model that represents a write operation. 

The ``MongoCollection.bulkWrite()`` method performs each kind of write
operation in a separate database call. For example, when you pass ``DeleteOneModel``, 
``DeleteManyModel``, and ``ReplaceOneModel`` objects to the method, it performs
two calls: one for the delete operations and one for the replace operation.

.. note::

   When the client splits operations into separate database calls, it might 
   reorder operations for efficiency if the bulk write operation is not ordered. 
   To learn more about operation execution order, see the :ref:`orderOfExecution` section.

The following sections show how to create and use each ``WriteModel``
document. The examples in each section use the following documents in the
``people`` collection:

.. code-block:: json

   { "_id": 1, "name": "Karen Sandoval", "age": 31 }
   { "_id": 2, "name": "William Chin", "age": 54 }
   { "_id": 8, "name": "Shayla Ray", "age": 20 }

This data is modeled by the following {+language+} data class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.bulk-data-model.kt
   :language: kotlin

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `bulkWrite() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-kotlin-coroutine/mongodb-driver-kotlin-coroutine/com.mongodb.kotlin.client.coroutine/-mongo-collection/bulk-write.html>`__
- `WriteModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/WriteModel.html>`__
- `BulkWriteOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/BulkWriteOptions.html>`__

Insert Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an insert operation, create an ``InsertOneModel`` specifying
the document you want to insert. To insert multiple documents, you must
create an ``InsertOneModel`` for each document you want to insert.

Example
```````

The following example creates an ``InsertOneModel`` for two documents
describing people:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.insert-one.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()`` operation, the ``InsertOneModel`` cannot
   insert a document with an ``_id`` that already exists in the
   collection. In this case, the driver throws a ``MongoBulkWriteException``.

   The following example tries to insert two documents where the ``_id``
   values are ``1`` and ``3``. Since there is already a document with an ``_id``
   of ``1`` in the collection, the operation results in an error:
   
   .. io-code-block::

      .. input:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.bulk-write-exception.kt
         :language:  kotlin

      .. output:: 
         :language:  console
         
         A MongoBulkWriteException occurred with the following message:  
         Bulk write operation error on server sample-shard-00-02.pw0q4.mongodb.net:27017. 
         Write errors: [BulkWriteError{index=0, code=11000, message='E11000 duplicate key 
         error collection: crudOps.bulkWrite index: _id_ dup key: { _id: 1 }', details={}}].

   To learn about why the driver didn't insert the document with the
   ``_id`` of ``3``, see the :ref:`Order of Execution <orderOfExecution>` section.

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the `InsertOneModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/InsertOneModel.html>`__ API documentation. 

Replace Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a replace operation, create a ``ReplaceOneModel`` specifying
a query filter for the document you want to replace and the replacement
document.

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``ReplaceOneModel`` cannot
   make changes that violate unique index constraints on
   the collection. Additionally, the model does not perform the replace
   operation if there are no matches to the query filter.

Example
```````

The following example creates a ``ReplaceOneModel`` to
replace a document where the ``_id`` is ``1`` with a document that
contains the additional ``location`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.replace-one.kt
   :language: kotlin

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
the ``ReplaceOneModel`` instance, the operation replaces the first
result. You can specify a sort in a ``ReplaceOptions`` instance to apply
an order to matched documents before the server performs the replace
operation, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.replace-model-options.kt
   :language: kotlin

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following resources:

- `ReplaceOneModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/ReplaceOneModel.html>`__ API documentation
- `ReplaceOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/ReplaceOptions.html>`__ API documentation
- :manual:`Unique indexes </core/index-unique/>` reference in the Server Manual

Update Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an update operation, create an ``UpdateOneModel`` or an
``UpdateManyModel`` that specifies a query filter and an update document.

The ``UpdateOneModel`` updates the first document that matches your query
filter and the ``UpdateManyModel`` updates all the documents that
match your query filter.

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``UpdateOneModel`` and
   ``UpdateManyModel`` types cannot make changes that violate unique
   index constraints on the collection. Additionally, the models do not
   perform update operations if there are no matches to the query
   filter.

Example
```````

The following example creates an ``UpdateOneModel`` to increment the ``age``
field by ``1`` in a document where the ``_id`` is ``2``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.update-one.kt
   :language: kotlin

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
the ``UpdateOneModel`` instance, the operation updates the first
result. You can specify a sort in an ``UpdateOptions`` instance to apply
an order to matched documents before the server performs the update
operation, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.update-model-options.kt
   :language: kotlin

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following resources:

- `UpdateOneModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/UpdateOneModel.html>`__ API documentation
- `UpdateManyModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/UpdateManyModel.html>`__ API documentation
- `UpdateOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/UpdateOptions.html>`__ API documentation
- :manual:`unique indexes </core/index-unique/>` Server Manual Explanation

Delete Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a delete operation, create a ``DeleteOneModel`` or a
``DeleteManyModel`` that specifies a query filter for documents you want
to delete.

The ``DeleteOneModel`` deletes the first document that matches your query
filter and the ``DeleteManyModel`` deletes all the documents that
match your query filter.

.. important::

   When performing a ``bulkWrite()``, the ``DeleteOneModel`` and
   ``DeleteManyModel`` types do not delete any documents if there are no
   matches to the query filter.

Example
```````

The following example creates a ``DeleteOneModel`` to delete
a document where the ``_id`` is ``1`` and a ``DeleteManyModel`` to delete
documents where the ``age`` value is less than ``30``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.delete.kt
   :language: kotlin

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `DeleteOneModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/DeleteOneModel.html>`__
- `DeleteManyModel <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/DeleteManyModel.html>`__

.. _orderOfExecution:

Order of Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``bulkWrite()`` method accepts an optional ``BulkWriteOptions`` as
a second parameter to specify if you want to execute the bulk operations
as ordered or unordered.

Ordered Execution
`````````````````

By default, the ``bulkWrite()`` method executes bulk operations in
order. This means that the operations execute in the order you
added them to the list until any error occurs.

Example 
^^^^^^^

The following example performs these bulk operations:

- An insert operation for a document where the ``name`` is
  ``"Zaynab Omar"`` and  the ``age`` is ``37``
- A replace operation for a document where the ``_id`` is ``1`` with a new
  document that contains the ``location`` field
- An update operation for a document where the ``_id`` is ``6`` to
  change the ``name`` field
- A delete operation for all documents that have an ``age`` value
  greater than ``50``

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.ordered.kt
   :language: kotlin

After running this example, your collection contains the following 
document:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false
   
   { "_id": 1, "name": "Sandy Kane", "location": "Helena, MT" }
   { "_id": 8, "name": "Shayla Ray", "age": 20 }
   { "_id": 6, "name": "Zaynab Hassan", "age": 37 }

Unordered Execution
```````````````````

You can also execute bulk operations in any order by passing ``false``
to the ``ordered()`` method on a ``BulkWriteOptions`` object. This means that
all the write operations execute regardless of errors. If any errors occur,
the driver reports them at the end.

The following code shows how to execute a bulk operation with no order
of execution:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/BulkTest.snippet.unordered.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. note::

   Unordered bulk operations do not guarantee the order of execution. The
   order may differ from the way you list them to optimize the runtime.
   
   In the preceding example, if the ``bulkWrite()`` method performed the
   insert operation after the update operation, the update operation
   would not produce changes because the document did not exist
   at that point in time. The collection would then contain the following
   documents:
   
   .. code-block:: json
      :copyable: false
   
      { "_id": 1, "name": "Sandy Kane", "location": "Helena, MT" }
      { "_id": 8, "name": "Shayla Ray", "age": 20 }
      { "_id": 6, "name": "Zaynab Omar", "age": 37 }

For more information about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `BulkWriteOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/BulkWriteOptions.html>`__
- `ordered() <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/BulkWriteOptions.html#ordered(boolean)>`__

.. _kotlin-client-bulk-write:

Client Bulk Write
-----------------

When connecting to a deployment running {+mdb-server+} 8.0 or later,
you can use the ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method to write
to multiple databases and collections in the same cluster. The ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()``
method performs all write operations in a single call.

The ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method takes a 
list of ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` instances to represent different write operations.
You can construct instances of the ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` interface by using 
instance methods. For example, an instance of ``ClientNamespacedInsertOneModel`` represents an
operation to insert one document, and you can create this model by using
the ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel.insertOne()`` method.

.. note:: Bulk Write Errors

   If any of the write operations fail, the driver raises a
   ``ClientBulkWriteException`` and does not perform any further individual
   operations. ``ClientBulkWriteException`` includes a ``BulkWriteError`` that can
   be accessed by using the ``ClientBulkWriteException.getWriteErrors()``
   method, which provides details of the individual failure.

The models and their corresponding instance methods are described
in the table below.

.. list-table::

The following sections provide examples of how to use the client ``bulkWrite()`` 
method. The sample data is modeled by the following {+language+} data classes:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/ClientBulkTest.snippet.data-classes.kt
   :language: kotlin

To learn more about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `bulkWrite()
  <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-kotlin-coroutine/mongodb-driver-kotlin-coroutine/com.mongodb.kotlin.client.coroutine/-mongo-cluster/bulk-write.html>`__
- `ClientNamespacedWriteModel
  <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/bulk/ClientNamespacedWriteModel.html>`__
- `MongoNamespace <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/MongoNamespace.html>`__

Insert Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to use the ``bulkWrite()`` method to insert 
two documents. One document is inserted into the ``sample_db.people`` collection, while
the other document is inserted into the ``sample_db.objects`` collection. 
The ``MongoNamespace`` instance defines the databases and collections that 
each write operation applies to.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/ClientBulkTest.snippet.insert-models.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. _kotlin-client-bulk-write-update:

Update Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows how to use the ``bulkWrite()`` method to update
existing documents in the ``sample_db.people`` and ``sample_db.objects`` collections:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/ClientBulkTest.snippet.update-models.kt
   :language: kotlin

This example increments the value of the ``age`` field by ``1`` in the
document that has a ``name`` value of ``"Freya Polk"`` in the ``people``
collection. It also sets the value of the ``manufacturer`` field to
``"Premium Technologies"`` in all documents that have a ``category``
value of ``"electronic"`` in the ``objects`` collection.

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
a ``ClientNamespacedUpdateOneModel`` instance, the operation updates the
first result. You can specify a sort order in a `ClientUpdateOneOptions
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/bulk/ClientUpdateOneOptions.html>`__
instance to apply an order to matched documents before the server
performs the update operation, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: kotlin

   val options =  ClientUpdateOneOptions
       .clientUpdateOneOptions()
       .sort(Sorts.ascending("_id"))

.. _kotlin-client-bulk-write-replace:

Replace Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example shows how to use the ``bulkWrite()`` method to replace
existing documents in the ``sample_db.people`` and ``sample_db.objects`` collections.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/ClientBulkTest.snippet.replace-models.kt
   :language: kotlin

After this example runs successfully, the document that has an ``_id`` value of ``1`` 
in the ``people`` collection is replaced with a new document. The document in 
the ``objects`` collection that has an ``_id`` value of ``1`` 
is replaced with a new document.

If multiple documents match the query filter specified in
a ``ClientNamespacedReplaceOneModel`` instance, the operation replaces the
first result. You can specify a sort order in a `ClientReplaceOneOptions
<{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/bulk/ClientReplaceOneOptions.html>`__
instance to apply an order to matched documents before the driver
performs the replace operation, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: kotlin

   val options =  ClientReplaceOneOptions
       .clientReplaceOneOptions()
       .sort(Sorts.ascending("_id"))

.. _kotlin-client-bulk-write-options:

Bulk Write Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pass an instance of ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` to the ``bulkWrite()``
method to specify options when running the bulk write operations.

Order of Execution
``````````````````

By default, the individual operations in a bulk operation are executed in the
order that you specify them until an error occurs, or until they execute 
successfully. However, you can pass ``false`` to the ``ordered()`` method on 
the ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` interface to perform write operations in an 
unordered way. When using the unordered option, an error-producing operation 
does not prevent execution of other write operations in the call to the 
``bulkWrite()`` method.

The following code sets the ``ordered()`` method on an
instance of ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` and performs a bulk write operation to 
insert multiple documents.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/ClientBulkTest.snippet.options.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :emphasize-lines: 3-5

Even though the write operation inserting a document with a duplicate key results
in an error, the other operations are executed because the write operation is
unordered.

To learn more about the methods and classes mentioned in this section,
see the following API documentation:

- `ClientBulkWriteOptions <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/bulk/ClientBulkWriteOptions.html>`__
- `ClientBulkWriteResult <{+api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/bulk/ClientBulkWriteResult.html>`__

Summary
-------

MongoCollection.bulkWrite()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform a bulk operation, you create and pass a list of
``WriteModel`` instances to the ``bulkWrite()`` method. 

There are 6 different ``WriteModel`` subtypes: ``InsertOneModel``,
``ReplaceOneModel``, ``UpdateOneModel``, ``UpdateManyModel``,
``DeleteOneModel`` and ``DeleteManyModel``. 

There are two ways to execute the ``bulkWrite()`` method: 

- Ordered, which performs the bulk operations in order until an error occurs, if any
- Unordered, which performs all the bulk operations in any order and reports errors
  at the end, if any

To learn more about the collection ``bulkWrite`` command, see the 
:manual:`db.collection.bulkWrite() </reference/method/db.collection.bulkWrite/>`
method reference in the {+mdb-server+} Manual.

MongoClient.bulkWrite()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When connecting to a deployment running {+mdb-server+} version 8.0 or later, you 
can use the ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method to perform bulk operations on multiple 
databases and collections at once.

To perform a client bulk operation, you create an pass a list of 
``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` instances to this method.

There are six subtypes of ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` that are used to
represent write operations. To construct these write models, you can use the
corresponding ``ClientNamespacedWriteModel`` methods ``insertOne()``, ``updateOne()``, 
``updateMany()``, ``replaceOne()``, ``deleteOne()``, and ``deleteMany()``. These 
methods take a ``MongoNamespace`` object that defines which
database and collection to write to.

The ``MongoClient.bulkWrite()`` method can also take a ``ClientBulkWriteOptions``
object to specify different options for how the command is executed.

To learn more about the client ``bulkWrite`` command, see the 
:manual:`bulkWrite() </reference/command/bulkWrite/>` method reference
in the {+mdb-server+} Manual.
