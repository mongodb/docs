Each {+SPI+} stores every configured connection to a streaming data
source or sink in its connection registry. The procedures on this page
walk you through creating and configuring your {+atlas-sp+}
connections.

.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

To create and configure connections, you must have the following:

- An |service| :ref:`project <manage-projects>`
- An |service| user with the :authrole:`Project Owner` or
  the :authrole:`Project Stream Processing Owner` role to manage a
  connection registry

  .. note::
     
     While both the :authrole:`Project Owner` and :authrole:`Project Stream Processing Owner`
     roles grant the privileges to create, view, edit and delete
     connections in the connection registry, the 
     :authrole:`Project Owner` role also allows users to perform tasks 
     such as creating database deployments, managing project access, and more. 

     See :ref:`Project Roles <project-roles>` to learn more about the 
     differences between these roles.

- An |service| {+cluster+}

.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-add:

Add a Connection to the Connection Registry
-------------------------------------------

For information on creating each type of connection, consult the
following pages:

- :ref:`Apache Kafka brokers <atlas-sp-kafka-connection>`
- :ref:`{+service+} databases <atlas-sp-atlas-connection>`
- :ref:`HTTPS connections <atlas-sp-https-connection>`
- :ref:`AWS S3 connections <atlas-sp-s3-connection>`
- :ref:`External Functions <atlas-sp-external-function-connection>`

Each type has distinct configuration requirements.

View Connections in the Connection Registry
-------------------------------------------

To view a connection to your {+spi+}:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: view-connection-cli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-streams-connections-list-and-describe.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: view-connection-ui

      .. include:: /includes/procedures/atlas-sp-view-connection-ui.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: view-connection-api

      The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides different endpoints for 
      retrieving one or all connections in a connection registry.

      :oas-atlas-tag:`View One Connection in a Connection Registry </Streams/operation/getStreanConnection>`
      
      :oas-atlas-tag:`List All Connections in a Connection Registry </Streams/operation/listStreamConnections>`

   .. tab:: ``mongosh``
      :tabid: view-connection-sh

      To list all available connections using ``mongosh``, use the
      ``sp.listConnections()`` method. It returns a list of documents
      describing each connection in the {+spi+}'s connection
      registry. It has the following syntax:

      .. code-block:: sh

         sp.listConnections()

.. _manage-spi-connection-modify:
.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-modify:

Modify a Connection from the Connection Registry
------------------------------------------------

To modify a connection from a connection registry:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: edit-connection-cli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-streams-connections-update.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: edit-connection-ui

      .. include:: /includes/procedures/atlas-sp-edit-connection-ui.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: edit-connection-api

      The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides an endpoint for editing a 
      {+spi+}.

      :oas-atlas-tag:`Update One Stream Instance </Streams/operation/updateStreamConnection>`

.. _manage-spi-connection-delete:
.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-delete:

Delete a Connection from the Connection Registry
------------------------------------------------

To delete a connection from a connection registry:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+atlas-cli+}
      :tabid: delete-connection-cli

      .. include:: /includes/extracts/atlas-streams-connections-delete.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-ui+}
      :tabid: delete-connection-ui

      .. include:: /includes/procedures/atlas-sp-delete-connection-ui.rst

   .. tab:: {+atlas-admin-api+}
      :tabid: delete-connection-api

      The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides an endpoint for editing a 
      {+spi+}.

      :oas-atlas-tag:`Delete One Stream Instance </Streams/operation/deleteStreamConnection>`

.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-pl-list:

List Private Link Connections
-----------------------------

The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides an endpoint for viewing all Private
Link connections configured for {+atlas-sp+} within a specified
project.

:oas-atlas-tag:`Return All Private Links
</Streams/operation/listPrivateLinkConnections>`

.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-pl-view:

View One Private Link Connection
--------------------------------

The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides an endpoint for viewing the details
of one Private Link connection configured for {+atlas-sp+} within a
specified project.

:oas-atlas-tag:`Return One Private Link
</Streams/operation/getPrivateLinkConnection>`

.. _atlas-sp-manage-connection-pl-delete:

Delete a Private Link Connection
--------------------------------

The {+atlas-admin-api+} provides an endpoint for deleting a Private
Link connection configured for {+atlas-sp+} within a specified
project.

:oas-atlas-tag:`Delete One Private Link
</Streams/operation/deletePrivateLinkConnection>`
