Causal Consistency and Read and Write Concerns
==============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

With MongoDB's :ref:`causally consistent client sessions <sessions>`,
different combinations of read and write concerns provide different
:ref:`causal consistency guarantees <causal-consistency-guarantees>`. 

The following table lists the specific guarantees that various 
combinations provide:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Read Concern
     - Write Concern
     - Read own writes
     - Monotonic reads
     - Monotonic writes
     - Writes follow reads

   * - :readconcern:`"majority"`
     - :writeconcern:`"majority"`
     - |checkmark|
     - |checkmark|
     - |checkmark|
     - |checkmark|

   * - :readconcern:`"majority"`
     - :writeconcern:`{ w: 1 } <\<number\>>`
     - 
     - |checkmark|
     - 
     - |checkmark|

   * - :readconcern:`"local"`
     - :writeconcern:`{ w: 1 } <\<number\>>`
     - 
     - 
     - 
     - 

   * - :readconcern:`"local"`
     - :writeconcern:`"majority"`
     - 
     - 
     - |checkmark|
     - 

If you want causal consistency with data durability, then, as 
seen from the table, only read operations with 
:readconcern:`"majority"` read concern and write operations with 
:writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern can guarantee all four causal 
consistency guarantees. That is, 
:ref:`causally consistent client sessions <sessions>` can only
guarantee causal consistency for:

- Read operations with :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern; in other 
  words, the read operations that return data that has been 
  acknowledged by a majority of the replica set members and is durable.

- Write operations with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern; 
  in other words, the write operations that request acknowledgement 
  that the operation has been applied to a majority of the replica 
  set's voting members.

If you want causal consistency without data durability (meaning that 
writes may be rolled back), then write operations with 
:writeconcern:`{ w: 1 } <\<number\>>` write concern can also provide 
causal consistency. 

.. note::

   The other combinations of read and write concerns may also satisfy
   all four causal consistency guarantees in some situations, but not
   necessarily in all situations.

The read concern :readconcern:`"majority"` and write concern
:writeconcern:`"majority"` ensure that the four causal consistency
guarantees hold even in :ref:`circumstances (such as with a network
partition) <edge-cases>` where two members in a replica set
*transiently* believe that they are the primary. And while both
primaries can complete writes with :writeconcern:`{ w: 1 }
<\<number\>>` write concern, only one primary will be able to complete
writes with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern.

For example, consider a situation where a network partition divides a
five member replica set:

.. figure:: /images/network-partition-two-primaries.svg
   :alt: Network partition: new primary elected on one side but old primary has not stepped down yet.
   :figwidth: 240px

.. example:: With the above partition

   - Writes with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write concern can complete
     on ``P``\ :sub:`new` but cannot complete on ``P``\ :sub:`old`.

   - Writes with :writeconcern:`{ w: 1 } <\<number\>>` write concern
     can complete on either ``P``\ :sub:`old` or ``P``\ :sub:`new`.
     However, the writes to ``P``\ :sub:`old` (as well as the writes
     replicated to ``S``\ :sub:`1`) roll back once these members regain
     communication with the rest of the replica set.

   - After a successful write with :writeconcern:`"majority"` write
     concern on ``P``\ :sub:`new`, causally consistent reads with
     :readconcern:`"majority"` read concern can observe the write on
     ``P``\ :sub:`new`, ``S``\ :sub:`2`,and ``S``\ :sub:`3`. The reads
     can also observe the write on ``P``\ :sub:`old` and ``S``\
     :sub:`1` once they can communicate with the rest of the replica
     set and sync from the other members of the replica set. Any writes
     made to ``P``\ :sub:`old` and/or replicated to ``S``\ :sub:`1`
     during the partition are rolled back.

Scenarios
---------

To illustrate the read and write concern requirements, the following
scenarios have a client issue a sequence of operations with various
combination of read and write concerns to the replica set:

- :ref:`causal-rc-majority-wc-majority`

- :ref:`causal-rc-majority-wc-1`

- :ref:`causal-rc-local-wc-majority`

- :ref:`causal-rc-local-wc-1`

   During the transient period with two primaries, because only ``P``\
