Each group of operations can have at most :limit:`1000 operations <Write Command Operation Limit Size>`. If a group exceeds this :limit:`limit
<Write Command Operation Limit Size>`, MongoDB will divide the group into
smaller groups of 1000 or less. For example, if the bulk operations list
consists of 2000 insert operations, MongoDB creates 2 groups, each with
1000 operations.

The sizes and grouping mechanics are internal performance details and
are subject to change in future versions.

To see how the operations are grouped for a bulk operation execution,
call :method:`Bulk.getOperations()` *after* the execution.
