- This tutorial starts with a Template App. You need an `Atlas Account 
  <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/register?tck=docs_realm>`_, an API key, and 
  {+cli+} to create a Template App.

  - You can learn more about creating an Atlas account in the 
    :atlas:`Atlas Getting Started </getting-started>` documentation. For this 
    tutorial, you need an Atlas account with a free-tier cluster.

  - You also need an Atlas :atlas:`API key
    </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>` for the MongoDB
    Cloud account you wish to log in with. You must be a :atlas:`Project
    Owner </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>` to create a Template
    App using {+cli+}.

  - To learn more about installing {+cli+}, see :ref:`Install App
    Services CLI <install-appservices-cli>`. After installing, run the
    :ref:`login <appservices-login>` command using the API key for
    your Atlas project.
