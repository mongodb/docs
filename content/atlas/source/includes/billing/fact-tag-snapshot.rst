   Resource tags that appear on invoice |csv| files and those returned
   from the |service| Admin API reflect your configuration of 
   resource tags at the moment the CSV is generated or the API is invoked.

   Please be aware that if you reconfigure your resource tags within a 
   billing cycle, your invoice reflects only the latest configuration of tags.
