.. tabs-auth::

   tabs:
     - id: uidpwd
       content: |

         For example, to authenticate as user ``grace`` using the ``admin``
         database and the Challenge and
         Response (``SCRAM-SHA-1``) authentication mechanism, write 
         the username in this format:

         .. code-block:: none

            grace?source=admin

     - id: ldap
       content: |

         For example, to authenticate as user ``grace`` with the |ldap| 
         (``PLAIN``) authentication mechanism, write the 
         username in this format:

         .. code-block:: none

            grace?mechanism=PLAIN&source=$external

     - id: kerberos
       content: |

         For example, to authenticate as user ``grace`` on the ``EXAMPLE.COM``
         `Kerberos realm <https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/admin/realm_config.html>`__
         with the Kerberos authentication mechanism, write the 
         username in this format:

         .. code-block:: none

            grace@EXAMPLE.COM?mechanism=GSSAPI&source=$external
