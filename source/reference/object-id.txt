.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

:term:`ObjectId <objectid>` is a 12-byte :term:`BSON` type,
constructed using:

- a 4-byte value representing the seconds since the Unix epoch,
- a 3-byte machine identifier,
- a 2-byte process id, and
- a 3-byte counter, starting with a random value.

In MongoDB, documents stored in a collection require a unique
:term:`_id` field that acts as a :term:`primary key`. Because
ObjectIds are small, most likely unique, and fast to generate, MongoDB
uses ObjectIds as the default value for the ``_id`` field if the
``_id`` field is not specified; i.e., the :program:`mongod` adds the
``_id`` field and generates a unique ObjectId to assign as its value.

Using ObjectIds for the ``_id`` field, provides the following
additional benefits:

- in the :program:`mongo` shell, you can access the creation time of
  the ``ObjectId``, using the :method:`getTimestamp()
  <ObjectId.getTimestamp()>` method.

- sorting on an ``_id`` field that stores ``ObjectId`` values is
  roughly equivalent to sorting by creation time.

  .. important::
  
     This relationship is not strict with ``ObjectId`` values 
     generated within a single second. This can happen if the 
     values are generated by multiple systems (or by multiple
     processes or threads on a single system) within a second,
     or as a result of clock skew on the client side, which
     would result in non-strict behavior even for entries that 
     are multiple seconds apart. This is because the ObjectId
     is generated by the client driver rather than the mongod
     process upon insert.

Also consider the :doc:`/core/document/` section for related
information on MongoDB's document orientation.

ObjectId()
----------

The :program:`mongo` shell provides the ``ObjectId()`` wrapper class to
generate a new ObjectId, and to provide the following helper attribute
and methods:

- ``str``

   The hexadecimal string value of the ``ObjectId()`` object.

- :method:`~ObjectId.getTimestamp()`

   Returns the timestamp portion of the ``ObjectId()`` object as a Date.

- :method:`~ObjectId.toString()`

   Returns the string representation of the ``ObjectId()`` object. The
   returned string literal has the format "``ObjectId(...)``".

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      In previous versions :method:`ObjectId.toString()` returns the
      value of the ObjectId as a hexadecimal string.

- :method:`valueOf() <ObjectId.valueOf()>`

   Returns the value of the ``ObjectId()`` object as a hexadecimal string.
   The returned string is the ``str`` attribute.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2
      In previous versions :method:`ObjectId.valueOf()` returns the
      ``ObjectId()`` object.

Examples
--------

Consider the following uses ``ObjectId()`` class in the
:program:`mongo` shell:

- To generate a new ObjectId, use the ``ObjectId()`` constructor with
  no argument:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     x = ObjectId()

  In this example, the value of ``x`` would be:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011")

- To generate a new ObjectId using the ``ObjectId()`` constructor with
  a unique hexadecimal string:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     y = ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ea")

  In this example, the value of ``y`` would be:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ea")

- To return the timestamp of an ``ObjectId()`` object, use the
  :method:`getTimestamp() <ObjectId.getTimestamp()>` method as follows:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ea").getTimestamp()

  This operation will return the following Date object:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     ISODate("2012-10-17T20:46:22Z")

- Access the ``str`` attribute of an ``ObjectId()`` object, as
  follows:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ea").str

  This operation will return the following hexadecimal string:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     507f191e810c19729de860ea

- To return the string representation of an ``ObjectId()`` object, use
  the :method:`~ObjectId.toString()` method as follows:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ea").toString()

  This operation will return the following output:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ea")

- To return the value of an ``ObjectId()`` object as a hexadecimal
  string, use the :method:`~ObjectId.valueOf()` method as
  follows:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     ObjectId("507f191e810c19729de860ea").valueOf()

  This operation returns the following output:

  .. code-block:: none

     507f191e810c19729de860ea
