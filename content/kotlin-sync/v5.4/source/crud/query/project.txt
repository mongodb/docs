Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to specify which fields to return from a read
operation by using a **projection**. A projection is a document that specifies
which fields MongoDB returns from a query.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``restaurants`` collection in the ``sample_restaurants``
database from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. To learn how to create a
free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

The documents in this collection are modeled by the following {+language+} data class:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/read/project.kt
   :start-after: start-data-class
   :end-before: end-data-class
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable:

Projection Types
----------------

You can use a projection to specify which fields to include in a return
document, or to specify which fields to exclude.

When specifying certain fields to include in a projection, all other fields are implicitly
excluded (except the ``_id`` field, which is included by default). You cannot combine
inclusion and exclusion statements in a single projection, unless you are excluding the
``_id`` field.

To remove the ``_id`` field from the returned document, you must
:ref:`explicitly exclude it <kotlin-sync-project-exclude-id>`.

Specify Fields to Include
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following syntax to specify the fields to include in the result:

.. code-block:: kotlin

   val projection = Projection.fields(
       Projections.include(<fieldName1>, <fieldName2>, ...)
   )

The following example uses the ``find()`` method to find all restaurants with
the ``name`` field value of ``"Emerald Pub"``. It then uses a projection to
return only the ``name``, ``cuisine``, and ``borough`` fields of the returned
documents.

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/read/project.kt
      :start-after: start-project
      :end-before: end-project
      :language: kotlin
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      Restaurant(id=5eb3d668b31de5d588f429e2, name=Emerald Pub, borough=Manhattan, cuisine=American)
      Restaurant(id=5eb3d668b31de5d588f432dd, name=Emerald Pub, borough=Queens, cuisine=American)

.. _kotlin-sync-project-exclude-id:

Exclude the ``_id`` Field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When specifying fields to include, you can also exclude the ``_id`` field from
the returned document.

The following example runs the same query as the preceding example, but
excludes the ``_id`` field from the projection:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/read/project.kt
      :start-after: start-project-exclude
      :end-before: end-project-exclude
      :language: kotlin
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :visible: false

      Restaurant(id=null, name=Emerald Pub, borough=Manhattan, cuisine=American)
      Restaurant(id=null, name=Emerald Pub, borough=Queens, cuisine=American)
