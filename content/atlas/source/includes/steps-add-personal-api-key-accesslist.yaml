  a. In the :guilabel:`Personal API Key Access List` section, click
     :guilabel:`Add`.

  #. Enter an |ipaddr| address or |cidr| range. To add multiple entries
     to your access list, repeat this step. If you leave your access

        :header-rows: 1

        * - Entry

          - Grants

        * - An |ipaddr| address

          - Access to protected operations from that address.

        * - A |cidr|\-notated range of |ipv4| addresses

          - Access to protected operations from those addresses.
