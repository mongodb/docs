This page displays a graphical representation of information found on
other :guilabel:`Admin` pages, in particular the :guilabel:`Jobs`
page. The :guilabel:`Job Timeline` page displays critical timestamps
(:term:`head <head database>`, last snapshot, next snapshot) and
offers a way to assign a :term:`daemon <Backup Daemon>` to a given job.

Click the :guilabel:`Auto refresh` checkbox to update the list
automatically every 10 seconds. Click the :guilabel:`Refresh` button
to refresh data manually.

To view the backup job |json|, click the :guilabel:`Show JSON` link
under the :guilabel:`Project` heading for any backup job. When the
|json| displays, click the :guilabel:`View raw runtime data` link
under the code to view the raw data. To hide the daemon |json|, click
the :guilabel:`Hide JSON` link.

To move the job to a new Backup Daemon, click the :guilabel:`Move head`
link under the :guilabel:`Machine` heading for a backup job. Select the
location and click the :guilabel:`Move head` button to move the job to
a new Backup Daemon. |onprem| does not automatically move jobs between
daemons.
