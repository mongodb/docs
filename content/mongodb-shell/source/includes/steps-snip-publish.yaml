title: Create a registry index file.
stepnum: 1

   The registry index file is not the same as the ``index.js`` file
   that contains your snippet code. The registry index file,
   ``index.bson.br``, contains metadata for the snippet packages in
   your registry. 
   
   The registry index file must be compressed before it is uploaded for
   use. The `make-index.js
   <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongosh-snippets/blob/main/scripts/make-index.js>`__
   utility in the scripts directory walks through your snippet source
   directories gathering the information that is needed to create the
   registry index file. After it creates the registry index file,
   ``make-index.js`` script also compresses it. 

   Run `make-index.js
   <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongosh-snippets/blob/main/scripts/make-index.js>`__
   from the ``mongo-snippets`` directory create the index.

   .. code-block:: shell

      node ./scripts/make-index.js

   The output of this script is a
   `brotli-compressed <https://github.com/google/brotli/>`__ registry
   index file, ``index.bson.br``. 

   You can use `show-index.js
   <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/mongosh-snippets/blob/main/scripts/show-index.js>`__
   to view the compressed registry index file. 

   Using ``make-index.js`` is the preferred way to create a registry
   index, but you can also :ref:`create a registry index manually
   <snip-manual-reg-index>`.
