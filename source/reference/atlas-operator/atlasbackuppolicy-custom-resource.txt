``AtlasBackupPolicy`` Custom Resource

The ``AtlasBackupPolicy`` custom resource configures a backup policy
that applies to the :ref:`atlasbackupschedule-custom-resource` that you 
can apply to your :ref:`atlasdeployment-custom-resource`. When you 
create the ``AtlasBackupPolicy`` custom resource, |ak8so| tries to 
create or update a backup policy.

|ak8so| does one of the following actions using the |service| 
:oas-atlas-op:`Cloud Backup Schedule API Resource 
</updateCloudBackupBackupPolicyForOneCluster>`:
   
- Creates a new backup policy.
- Updates an existing backup policy.

If you remove the ``AtlasBackupPolicy`` resource from your |k8s| 
cluster, |service| stops creating backups for your {+cluster+}.

.. note:: 

   You must do all of the following tasks to back up a {+cluster+}:

   1. Create a backup policy.
   #. Create a 
      :ref:`backup schedule <atlasbackupschedule-custom-resource>` and
      set the :setting:`spec.policy.name` field to the name of the
      configured backup policy.
   #. Set the :setting:`spec.backupRef.name` field in the
      :ref:`atlasdeployment-custom-resource` to the name of the 
      configured backup schedule.

   To learn more, see :ref:`ak8so-backup`.

Example
-------

The following example shows an ``AtlasBackupPolicy`` custom resource
that is configured to take snapshots weekly and retain snapshots for
seven days:

.. code-block::

   apiVersion: atlas.mongodb.com/v1
   kind: AtlasBackupPolicy
   metadata:
     name: "atlas-default-backuppolicy"
   spec:
     items:
       frequencyType: "weekly"
       frequencyInterval: 1
       retentionUnit: "days"
       retentionValue: 7

Parameters
----------

This section describes some of the key ``AtlasBackupPolicy`` custom
resource parameters available. For a full list of parameters available,
see the |service| 
:oas-atlas-op:`Modify {+Cloud-Backup+} Backup Policy API 
</updateCloudBackupBackupPolicyForOneCluster>`. Refer 
to these descriptions, the available examples, and the |api| 
documentation to customize your specifications.

.. setting:: spec.items

   *Type*: array

   *Conditional*

   List that contains the policy item parameters from the 
   |api|. For a full list of parameters available, see the |service|
   :oas-atlas-op:`Modify {+Cloud-Backup+} Backup Policy API 
   </updateCloudBackupBackupPolicyForOneCluster>`.

.. setting:: spec.items.frequencyInterval

   *Type*: number

   *Required*

   Number that indicates the desired frequency of the new backup policy
   item specified by :setting:`spec.items.frequencyType`. A value of
   ``1`` specifies the first instance of the corresponding
   :setting:`spec.items.frequencyType`.

   .. example::

      - In a monthly policy item, ``1`` indicates that the monthly
        snapshot occurs on the first day of the month.
      - In a weekly policy item, ``1`` indicates that the weekly
        snapshot occurs on Monday.

   This setting accepts the following frequency values:

   - Hourly: ``1``, ``2``, ``4``, ``6``, ``8``, and ``12``.
   - Daily: ``1``.
   - Weekly: ``1`` through ``7``, where ``1`` is Monday and ``7`` is
     Sunday.
   - Monthly: ``1`` through ``28`` and ``40``, where ``1`` is the first
     day of the month and ``40`` is the last day of the month.

.. setting:: spec.items.frequencyType

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   String that indicates the frequency associated with the backup
   policy item. Accepted values are: ``hourly``, ``daily``, ``weekly``,
   or ``monthly``.

   .. note::

      You can't specify multiple ``hourly`` and ``daily`` backup policy
      items.

.. setting:: spec.items.retentionUnit

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   String that indicates the scope of the backup policy item. Together
   with :setting:`spec.items.retentionValue`, these settings define the
   length of time to retain snapshots. Accepted values are: ``days``,
   ``weeks``, or ``months``.

.. setting:: spec.items.retentionValue

   *Type*: string

   *Required*

   String that indicates the value to associate with 
   :setting:`spec.items.retentionUnit`. Together with
   :setting:`spec.items.retentionUnit`, these settings define
   the length of time to retain snapshots.
