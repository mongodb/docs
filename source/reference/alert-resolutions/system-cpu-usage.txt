Description
-----------

``System CPU`` alerts indicate that the CPU usage of the MongoDB
process has reached a specified threshold. This threshold is specified
when the alert is created.

Triggers
--------

:alert:`System: CPU (Steal) % is`
  Occurs when the CPU usage exceeds the guaranteed baseline CPU credit
  accumulation rate by the specified threshold. For more information on
  CPU credit accumulation, refer to the |aws| documentation for
  `Burstable Performance Instances
  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html>`__.

  .. note::

     The :alert:`System: CPU (Steal) % is` alert is applicable when
     the EC2 instance credit balance is exhausted. |service| triggers
     this alert only for AWS EC2 instances that support `Burstable
     Performance Instances
     <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html>`__.
     Currently, these are ``M10`` and ``M20`` cluster types.

:alert:`System: CPU (User) % is`
  Occurs when the CPU usage of the MongoDB process, as normalized by
  the number of CPUs, exceeds the specified threshold.

Possible Solutions
------------------

- Consider adding one or more :manual:`indexes </indexes/>` to improve
  query performance.

- Consider upgrading your cluster to a higher tier to
  reduce the CPU usage percentage utilized by the current workload.
  For more information on upgrading a cluster, see
  :doc:`Modify a Cluster </scale-cluster>`.
