This page lists the Global Whitelist Entries configured for the
|onprem| instance. Each entry represents a host IP or |cidr| block from
which |onprem| accepts incoming |api| requests. You can search for a
whitelist entry, add whitelist entries, and edit or delete existing
whitelist entries.

.. note::

   |mms| limits all actions in this section to users or Global |api|
   Keys that were granted the :authrole:`Global Owner` role.

          .. note::
             You can click :guilabel:`Use Current IP Address` to add
             the public IP address of the host you are using to access

.. _delete-global-whitelist-entry:

Delete a Whitelist Entry

   Deleting a Global Whitelist Entry impacts applications that require
   that whitelist entry, unless another whitelist entry includes that
   address. If no entries cover the application address, the
   application cannot access the |api|.

   :icon-mms:`ellipsis` then select :guilabel:`Delete Whitelist Entry`.

   The :guilabel:`Delete Global Whitelist Entry` modal displays.

   the box to confirm that you want to delete this entry.

#. Click :guilabel:`Delete` if you want to delete your global
   whitelist entry. Click :guilabel:`Cancel` to close the modal without
   deleting the whitelist entry.
