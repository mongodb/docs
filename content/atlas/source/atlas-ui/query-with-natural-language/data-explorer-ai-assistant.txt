Read-Only Tools
---------------

Read-only tools in the {+data-explorer+}'s assistant fetch context from your 
current task or execute database operations against your connected MongoDB 
deployment with human approval. Unlike conversational responses, these tools 
may perform actual database queries and return live data from your database.

Assistant tools exhibit the following key characteristics:

- **Read-only:** Tools cannot modify, insert, update, or delete data.
- **User-approved:** Every tool execution requires explicit user confirmation.
- **Contextual:** The assistant accounts for your current database, collection,
  and connection when deciding to call tools.
- **Live data:** Results come from your connected MongoDB deployment in real-time.

Data Explorer Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following tools fetch sensitive content for users and require confirmation.
These tools do not interact with the database, but require user confirmation 
before use: 

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Data Explorer Tool Name
     - Description

   * - ``get-current-query``
     - Extracts active MongoDB query parameters from the query bar

   * - ``get-current-pipeline``
     - Extracts active aggregation pipeline from the aggregation builder

Database Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Database Tool Name
     - Description

   * - ``list-databases``
     - Displays all databases available in your MongoDB deployment with their 
       storage sizes.

   * - ``list-collections``
     - Shows all collections within a specific database.

   * - ``find``
     - Retrieves actual documents from a collection that match specific search 
       criteria. 

   * - ``count``
     - Quickly returns the total number of documents in a collection without
       retrieving the documents themselves. 

   * - ``aggregate``
     - Performs complex data processing operations like grouping, filtering,
       transforming, and calculating statstics across documents. 

   * - ``collection-indexes``
     - Lists all indexes defined on a collection.

   * - ``collection-schema``
     - Analyzes a collection to reveal the structure of documents, including 
       field names and data types. 

   * - ``collection-storage-size``
     - Reports the physical disk space occupied by a collection, including both
       data and indexes. 

   * - ``db-stats``
     - Provides a comprehensive overview of database health, including collection
       counts, document totals, storage usage, and index statistics. 

   * - ``mongodb-logs``
     - Retrieves recent server logs for troubleshooting, performance monitoring,
       and security auditing. 

   * - ``explain``
     - Shows the detailed query execution plan and performance statistics, 
       revealing how MongoDB processes a query and whether it uses indexes. 

.. note::

   The aggregation pipeline stages ``$out`` and ``$merge`` are not supported in 
   tool calling because they perform write operations. The assistant only 
   supports read-only tools. 

Example Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Enable Tools
      
      Tools are enabled by default, but you can toggle them on or off using the
      :guilabel:`Tools` button in the input bar. 

   .. step:: Set Up Your Environment
      
      Make sure you have an active connection and are viewing the relevant page.
      To ask a question, you must be on a tab that relates to your active 
      connection. 

   .. step:: Ask a Database Question

      Submit a prompt inquiring about your data, for example: "List all databases".

   .. step:: Review the Tool Card

      The assistant detects your intent and displays a tool card in a pending
      state. This list enumerates the possible elements that the tool card can
      show:

      - Tool name operation
      - Deployment (host/endpoint)
      - Database and collection being queried 
      - Any parameters or filters
      - :guilabel:`Run` and :guilabel:`Cancel` buttons

      For the above example, the tool card shows for "list-databases".

   .. step:: Click Run

   .. step:: View Results

      Example result:

      .. code-block::
         :copyable: false

         Here are the databases found on your MongoDB deployment:

         - sample_mflix (Size: 183,685,120 bytes)
         - admin (Size: 364,544 bytes)
         - local (Size: 21,907,722,240 bytes)
      
         If you want details about collections in any of these databases, 
         just let me know!

Examples
--------

The following scenarios show several uses of the intelligent assistant in 
{+data-explorer+}.

Explain Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ask the intelligent assistant to analyze the output of your |compass| query:

.. io-code-block::
    :copyable: true

    .. input::

       Interpret this explain plan for me.

    .. output:: 

       ## Summary
       - **Query Logic:** This pipeline counts the number of Italian restaurants in Manhattan by first filtering documents and then aggregating the count.
       - **Performance:** Fair
       - **Recommendations:** Create a compound index on `{ borough: 1, cuisine: 1 }` to optimize document retrieval.

       ## Details

       ### Query Logic
       1. `$match`: Filters documents where `borough` is "Manhattan" and `cuisine` is "Italian".
       2. `$count`: Counts the number of documents matching the filter and outputs the total.

       ### Performance Analysis
       - The winning plan uses an index scan on the `cuisine` field (`cuisine_1`) and applies an in-memory filter for `borough` ("Manhattan").
       - Both `totalKeysExamined` and `totalDocsExamined` are high (43,207), which implies that every document with `cuisine: "Italian"` is examined and then filtered by `borough`.
       - No compound index exists, meaning MongoDB cannot efficiently combine both filter criteria in a single index lookup.
       - The pipeline does properly filter before counting, but index usage is only partial, causing increased resource usage.

       ### Recommendations
       - Create a compound index on `{ borough: 1, cuisine: 1 }` to allow MongoDB to retrieve documents matching both criteria directly from the index, minimizing documents examined.
       - This optimization will reduce execution time and system load without changing the output of your aggregation pipeline.

       Below is the recommended Aggregation Pipeline. This optimized Aggregation Pipeline will leverage the compound index to scan fewer documents, as both filter criteria are present in the index.

       ```json
       [
         { "$match": { "borough": "Manhattan", "cuisine": "Italian" } },
         { "$count": "totalItalianRestaurants" }
       ]
       ```

       ### Follow-Up Questions
       1. How do I create a compound index in MongoDB Compass or via a shell command?
       2. What other fields should I consider adding to my indexes for restaurant lookups?
       3. How can I further optimize aggregations when working with larger datasets?


User questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following examples demonstrate questions you can ask the intelligent assistant about 
{+data-explorer+} functions and queries.

.. io-code-block::
    :copyable: true

    .. input::

       How is MongoDB data modeling different from data modeling with a relational
       database?

    .. output:: 

       MongoDB data modeling differs from relational database (RDBMS) data 
       modeling in some important ways:

       1. Document-Oriented vs. Table-Oriented

         - MongoDB stores data as flexible, hierarchical JSON-like documents.
         - Relational databases use tables with fixed schemas and columns.

       2. Schema Flexibility
       
         - In MongoDB, collections can contain documents with different structures. Schema enforcement is optional.
         - RDBMS tables have a strict schema that enforces data types and relationships.

       3. Embedding vs. Normalization

         - MongoDB encourages embedding related data inside documents when appropriate (denormalization). Example: An order document may include an array of items directly inside it.
         - Relational databases emphasize normalization—splitting data across tables connected by foreign keys.

       4. Relationships

         - MongoDB does support references between documents (similar to foreign keys), but joins are less central and not as efficient as in RDBMS.
         - RDBMSs use normalized data and JOIN operations to relate tables efficiently.

       5. Performance & Scaling

         - MongoDB’s data model enables horizontal scaling (sharding), making it well-suited for large, distributed datasets.
         - RDBMS scaling typically relies on vertical scaling or complex clustering; JOINs can become expensive as data grows.

       6. Use Cases and Design Philosophy 

         - MongoDB models are often designed to optimize common query patterns, reducing the need for joins and complex queries.
         - RDBMS models are designed for transactional consistency and for representing organized, well-structured relationships.

       In summary, MongoDB encourages a more flexible, application-driven 
       approach to modeling, while relational databases rely on rigid schemas 
       and normalized relationships. Compass provides tools to visually explore 
       your document structures and relationships, which can be especially 
       helpful as your model evolves.

    .. input::

       How can I combine multiple conditions in a single $search query?

    .. output:: 

       To combine multiple conditions in a single $search query in MongoDB Atlas
       Search (including Compass), you should use the compound operator. The 
       compound operator allows you to specify multiple criteria using must, 
       mustNot, filter, and should clauses.

       Example: Combine Multiple Conditions

       Suppose you want to:

       - Match documents where the plot field contains "baseball"
       - Exclude documents where the genres field contains "Comedy" or "Romance"
       
       Your $search stage would look like this:

       {
         "$search": {
           "compound": {
             "must": [
               {
                 "text": {
                   "query": "baseball",
                   "path": "plot"
                  }
               }
             ],
             "mustNot": [
               {
                 "text": {
                   "query": ["Comedy", "Romance"],
                   "path": "genres"
                 }
               }
             ]
          }
         }
       }
