Pre-Migration Analysis generates a report that lists migration risks in your
source database. This reference page lists all of the migration risks
Relational Migrator may detect on supported databases.

Risk Categories
---------------

Migration risks are categorized as one of:

- **Data Type:** Data types that can result in lost precision or lost data when
  migrating to MongoDB.
- **Schema:** Database or table configuration that causes difficulties when 
  mapping source database schema to MongoDB.
- **Unsupported Feature:** Features of other databases that aren't supported 
  in MongoDB.
- **Performance:** Database or table configuration that may cause performance
  issues when migrating data into MongoDB.

             ``MYSQL_POLYGON``, ``MYSQL_MULTIPOINT``,
             ``MYSQL_MULTILINESTRING``, ``MYSQL_MULTIPOLYGON``,
             ``MYSQL_GEOMETRYCOLLECTION``
           - High
           - The table contains columns which require special handling: 
             <columns>.
           - You are storing geospatial data in your database. These will be
             converted to objects with a ``srid (int)`` coordinate reference
             and ``wkb (binary)`` content in WKB (well-known-binary) format

         * - Blob Types
           - Table
           - Data Types: 
             ``MYSQL_MEDIUMBLOB``, ``MYSQL_LONGBLOB``, ``MYSQL_MEDIUMTEXT``, 
             ``MYSQL_LONGTEXT``
           - Medium
           - The table contains columns which could exceed the 16MB limit.
           - If you are storing >16MB in the record, the migration will fail as
             :manual:`MongoDB documents cannot exceed 16MB 
             </reference/limits/#mongodb-limit-BSON-Document-Size>`. We
             strongly advise against storing large blobs in MongoDB, but if
             multi-document transactions aren't required you can use 
             :manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs>`.

         * - Numeric precision (specified)
           - Table
           - Data Type
           - Medium
           - The following columns are at risk of data loss due to decimal 
             precision: <columns>.
           - The specified columns have been configured to support more decimal
             precision than is supported in a Decimal128 field. During
             migration, these values will be rounded to 34 significant figures.

         * - Numeric precision (unspecified)
           - Table
           - Data Type
           - Medium
           - The following columns may be at risk of data loss due to decimal
             precision: <columns>.
           - The specified columns are using variable decimal precision and may
             contain values with more decimal precision than is supported in a
             Decimal128 field. During migration, these values will be rounded
             to 34 significant figures.

         * - Auto-Incrementing Columns
           - Table
           - Schema
           - High
           - Table <name> has an auto incrementing column.
           - MongoDB encourages the use of ObjectID for ID fields because 
             incrementing IDs have difficulty sharding. MongoDB Relational
             Migrator can :ref:`migrate your keys as-is 
             <rm-key-handling-setting>`, but you will need to write
             code to maintain this behavior. If you're using MongoDB Atlas, you
             can use `Atlas Triggers to auto-increment your IDs 
             <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/migrator-auto-increment>`__.

         * - No foreign keys found
           - Database
           - Schema
           - Medium
           - The <name> database has no foreign keys.
           - This will make the schema mapping more complicated as we cannot
             infer the relationship between your tables without them. You can
             use the synthetic foreign keys feature of Migrator to define
             logical relationships between your tables.

         * - Views
           - Database
           - Schema
           - Medium
           - There were views detected in <database>.
           - Views are supported in MongoDB but they must be converted into 
             MQL. Consider using :ref:`Query Converter <rm-query-converter>` to migrate your views.
         
         * - Triggers
           - Database
           - Unsupported Feature
           - High
           - The <name> database has triggers.
           - MongoDB has no native way to implement triggers. If you're using
             Atlas, consider using :ref:`Query Converter <rm-query-converter>`
             to convert your existing triggers to :atlas:`Atlas Triggers
             </atlas-ui/triggers/>` to replicate the existing behavior.

         * - Routines
           - Database
           - Unsupported Feature
           - Medium
           - There were routines detected in <database>.
           - MongoDB has no native way to represent routines. Consider using 
             :ref:`Query Converter <rm-query-converter>` to migrate your 
             routines to application code.

         * - Large single table
           - Database
           - Performance
           - Medium
           - The total data size of the selected tables is greater than 
             <limit> GB, at 100 GB.
           - Larger data migration jobs can require careful planning to 
             maximize performance and reliability. The deployment 
             considerations topic in the documentation provides advice which 
             can help. For jobs that may run over multiple days, consider 
             using the Kafka deployment model.

         * - Timezones on dates
           - Table
           - Data Types:
             ``ORACLE_TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIME_ZONE``, 
             ``ORACLE_TIMESTAMP_WITH_LOCAL_TIME_ZONE``
           - Medium
           - Detected columns with <type> type. MongoDB stores times in UTC by 
             default, and Relational Migrator may convert any local time 
             representations into this form or to a direct string. Affected 
             columns: <columns>.
           - MongoDB does not support storing timezones with time data. 
             Consider converting to a desired timezone in your application or 
             storing it as a string.

         * - File on-disk
           - Table
           - Data Type:
             ``ORACLE_BFILE``
           - Medium
           - Detected columns with type <type>. Migration to MongoDB is not 
             currently supported for this type. Affected columns: <columns>.
           - ``ORACLE_BFILE`` is not supported by MongoDB. If the file must be 
             stored in your database and multi-document transactions aren't 
             required, you can use :manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs>`. Otherwise,
             we encourage storing your files on cloud storage & recording the
             URI instead.

         * - Unsupported Oracle Types
           - Table
           - Data Types:
             ``ORACLE_LONG``, ``ORACLE_LONG_RAW``, ``ORACLE_UROWID``
           - Medium
           - Detected columns with type <type>. Migration to MongoDB is not 
             currently supported for this type. Affected columns: <columns>.
           - The report groups all columns of a given unsupported type into a
             single item.
           
             - ``ORACLE_LONG`` data type is deprecated by Oracle and 
               equivalent LOB data types are not supported in MongoDB. If the
               file must be stored in your database and multi-document
               transactions aren't required, you can use 
               :manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs>`. Otherwise, we encourage storing
               your files on cloud storage & recording the URI instead.
             - ``ORACLE_UROWID`` data type is essentially a FK to another row, 
               stored as binary. We encourage migrating to using explicit IDs 
               where possible, with FK enforcement, to assist data migration.

         * - Auto-Incrementing Columns
           - Table

         * - Oracle Packages
           - Database
           - Unsupported Feature
           - Medium
           - A package is a schema object that groups logically related PL/SQL 
             types, variables, constants, subprograms, cursors, and exceptions.
             A package is compiled and stored in the database, where many 
             applications can share its contents.
           - MongoDB does not have any features that are equivalent to Oracle 
             Packages. You can use the :ref:`Query Converter
             <rm-query-converter>` to define logical relationships between your
             tables.

           - High
           - The <name> database has triggers.
           - MongoDB has no native way to implement triggers. If you're using
             Atlas, consider using :ref:`Query Converter <rm-query-converter>`
             to convert your existing triggers to :atlas:`Atlas Triggers
             </atlas-ui/triggers/>` to replicate the existing behavior.

           - Unsupported Feature
           - Medium
           - There were routines detected in <database>.
           - MongoDB has no native way to represent routines. Consider using 
             :ref:`Query Converter <rm-query-converter>` to migrate your

           - Medium
           - The total data size of the selected tables is greater than 
             <limit> GB, at 100 GB.
           - Larger data migration jobs can require careful planning to 
             maximize performance and reliability. The deployment 
             considerations topic in the documentation provides advice which 
             can help. For jobs that may run over multiple days, consider 
             using the Kafka deployment model.

           - Data Types: 
             ``SQL_SERVER_GEOGRAPHY``, ``SQL_SERVER_GEOMETRY``
           - High
           - The table contains columns which require special handling: 
             <columns>.
           - You are storing geospatial data in your database. These will be
             converted to objects with a ``srid (int)`` coordinate reference
             and ``wkb (binary)`` content in WKB (well-known-binary) format

         * - Blob Types

           - Medium
           - The table contains columns which could exceed the 16MB limit.
           - If you are storing >16MB in the record, the migration will fail as
             :manual:`MongoDB documents cannot exceed 16MB 
             </reference/limits/#mongodb-limit-BSON-Document-Size>`. We
             strongly advise against storing large blobs in MongoDB, but if
             multi-document transactions aren't required you can use 
             :manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs>`.

           - The specified columns have been configured to support more decimal
             precision than is supported in a Decimal128 field. During
             migration, these values will be rounded to 34 significant figures.

           - Medium
           - The following columns may be at risk of data loss due to decimal
             precision: <columns>.
           - The specified columns are using variable decimal precision and may
             contain values with more decimal precision than is supported in a
             Decimal128 field. During migration, these values will be rounded
             to 34 significant figures.

         * - Timezones on dates
           - Table
           - Data Type:
             ``SQL_SERVER_DATETIMEOFFSET``
           - Medium
           - Detected columns with <type> type. MongoDB stores times in UTC by 
             default, and Relational Migrator may convert any local time
             representations into this form or to a direct string. Affected 
             columns: <columns>.
           - MongoDB does not support storing timezones with time data. 
             Consider converting to a desired timezone in your application or
             storing it as a string.
             
         * - File on-disk
           - Table
           - Data Type:
             ``FILESTREAM``
           - Medium
           - Detected columns with type <type>. Migration to MongoDB is not 
             currently supported for this type. Affected columns: <columns>.
           - ``FILESTREAM`` is not supported by MongoDB. FILESTREAM data type 
             not supported by MongoDB. If the file must be stored in your
             database and multi-document transactions aren't required, you can 
             use :manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs>`.

         * - Unsupported SQL Server Types
           - Table
           - Data Types:
             ``SQLSERVER_HIERARCHYID``, ``SQLSERVER_ROWVERSION``, 
             ``SQLSERVER_SQL_VARIANT``, ``SQLSERVER_UNIQUEIDENTIFIER``
           - Medium
           - Detected columns with type <type>. Migration to MongoDB is not 
             currently supported for this type. Affected columns: <columns>.
           - The report groups all columns of a given unsupported type into a
             single item.

             - There is no direct equivalent for the ``SQLSERVER_HIERARCHYID`` 
               within MongoDB. Instead, embedded documents should be used to 
               model hierarchical data.
             - ``SQLSERVER_ROWVERSION (ROWVERSION)`` data type is used for 
               version-stamping table rows and there no direct equivalent 
               within MongoDB. You can simulate this using an Integer or a 
               String field to store and increment version information 
               manually. Alternatively, Change Streams could also be used for 
               version tracking.
             - ``SQLSERVER_SQL_VARIANT`` data type is a flexible way to store
               data of various SQL Server supported data types. MongoDB does
               not have an exact equivalent, however the flexible schema model
               allows for similar storage by dynamically typing fields.
             - MongoDB does not have a native GUID data type. 
               ``SQLSERVER_UNIQUEIDENTIFIER`` types will be 
               migrated to Strings. You can use ObjectIDs, or generate these 
               UUIDs in your application code.
         
         * - Auto-Incrementing Columns
           - Table
           - Schema
           - High
           - Table <name> has an auto incrementing column.
           - MongoDB encourages the use of ObjectID for ID fields because 
             incrementing IDs have difficulty sharding. MongoDB Relational
             Migrator can :ref:`migrate your keys as-is 
             <rm-key-handling-setting>`, but you will need to write
             code to maintain this behavior. If you're using MongoDB Atlas, you
             can use `Atlas Triggers to auto-increment your IDs 
             <https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/migrator-auto-increment>`__.

         * - No foreign keys found
           - Database
           - Schema
           - Medium
           - The <name> database has no foreign keys.
           - This will make the schema mapping more complicated as we cannot
             infer the relationship between your tables without them. You can
             use the synthetic foreign keys feature of Migrator to define
             logical relationships between your tables.

         * - Views
           - Database
           - Schema
           - Medium
           - There were views detected in <database>.
           - Views are supported in MongoDB but they must be converted into 
             MQL. Consider using :ref:`Query Converter <rm-query-converter>` 
             to migrate your views.
         
         * - Triggers
           - Database
           - Unsupported Feature
           - High
           - The <name> database has triggers.
           - MongoDB has no native way to implement triggers. If you're using
             Atlas, consider using :ref:`Query Converter <rm-query-converter>`
             to convert your existing triggers to :atlas:`Atlas Triggers
