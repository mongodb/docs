An {+atlas-sp+} stream processor applies the logic of a uniquely named 
:ref:`stream aggregation pipeline <stream-aggregation>` to your 
streaming data. {+atlas-sp+} saves each stream processor definition to
persistent storage so that it can be reused. You can only use a given 
stream processor in the 
:ref:`{+spi+} <manage-spi>` its definition is 
stored in.

Prerequisites
-------------

To create and manage a stream processor, you must have:

- A :ref:`{+spi+} <manage-spi>`
- {+mongosh+} version 2.0 or higher
- A user with:

  - |service| :authrole:`Project Owner` privileges OR
  - :atlasrole:`atlasAdmin` privileges

Create a Stream Processor
-------------------------

To create a new stream processor with {+mongosh+}, use the 
``sp.createStreamProcessor()`` method. It has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: sh

   sp.createStreamProcessor(<name>, <pipeline>, <options>)

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 10 50 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Argument
     - Type
     - Necessity
     - Description

   * - ``name``
     - string
     - Required
     - Logical name for the stream processor. This must be unique
       within the {+spi+}.

   * - ``pipeline``
     - array
     - Required
     - :ref:`Stream aggregation pipeline <stream-aggregation>` you
       want to apply to your streaming data.

   * - ``options``
     - object
     - Optional
     - Object defining various optional settings for your stream
       processor.

   * - ``options.dlq``
     - object
     - Conditional
     - Object assigning a 
       :term:`dead letter queue` for your {+spi+}. This field is 
       necessary if you define the ``options`` field.

   * - ``options.dlq.connectionName``
     - string
     - Conditional
     - Human-readable label that identifies a connection in your 
       connection registry. This connection must reference an 
       |service| {+cluster+}. This field is necessary if you define the
       ``options.dlq`` field.

   * - ``options.dlq.db``
     - string
     - Conditional
     - Name of an |service| database on the {+cluster+} specified 
       in ``options.dlq.connectionName``. This field is necessary if 
       you define the ``options.dlq`` field.

   * - ``options.dlq.coll``
     - string
     - Conditional
     - Name of a collection in the database specified in
       ``options.dlq.db``. This field is necessary if you 
       define the ``options.dlq`` field.

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Connect to your {+spi+}.
      
      Use the connection string associated with your {+spi+}
      to connect using {+mongosh+}.

      .. example::

         The following command connects to a {+spi+} as a user named
         ``streamOwner`` using SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication:

         .. code-block:: sh

            mongosh "mongodb://atlas-stream-78xq9gi1v4b4288x06a73e9f-zi30g.virginia-usa.a.query.mongodb-qa.net/?authSource=%24external&authMechanism=MONGODB-X509" \\ 
            --tls --authenticationDatabase admin --username streamOwner

         Provide your user password when prompted.

   .. step:: Define a pipeline.

      In the {+mongosh+} prompt, assign an array containing the
      aggregation stages you want to apply to a variable named 
      ``pipeline``. 
      
      The following example uses the ``stuff`` topic in
      the  ``myKafka`` connection in the connection registry as the 
      :pipeline:`$source`, matches records where the ``temperature`` 
      field has a value of ``46`` and emits the processed messages to 
      the ``output`` topic of the ``mySink`` connection in 
      the connection registry:

      .. code-block:: sh

         pipeline = [
          {$source: {"connectionName": "myKafka", "topic": "stuff"}},
          {$match: { temperature: 46 }},
          {
            "$emit": {
              "connectionName": "mySink",
              "topic" : "output",
            }  
          }
         ]

   .. step:: (Optional) Define a 
      :term:`DLQ <dead letter queue>`.

      In the {+mongosh+} prompt, assign an object containing the
      following properties of your DLQ:

      - Connection name
      - Database name
      - Collection name

      The following example defines a DLQ over the ``cluster01``
      connection, in the ``metadata.dlq`` database collection.

      .. code-block:: sh

         deadLetter = {
           dlq: {
             connectionName: "cluster01", 
             db: "metadata", 
             coll: "dlq"
           }
         }

   .. step:: Create a stream processor.

      The following command creates a stream processor named 
      ``proc01`` that applies the logic defined in ``pipeline``.
      Documents that throw errors in processing are written to the
      DLQ defined in ``deadLetter``.

      .. code-block:: sh
      
         sp.createStreamProcessor("proc01", pipeline, deadLetter)

.. _streams-list-procs:

List Available Stream Processors
--------------------------------

To list all available stream processors on the current {+spi+} with 
{+mongosh+}, use the ``sp.listStreamProcessors()`` method. It returns 
a list of documents containing the name, start time, current state, and 
pipeline associated with each stream processor. It has the following 
syntax:

.. code-block:: sh

   sp.listStreamProcessors(<filter>)

``<filter>`` is a document specifying which field(s) to filter the list 
by.

.. example::

   The following example shows a return value for an unfiltered 
   request:

   .. io-code-block::
      :copyable: true

      .. input:: 
         :language: sh

         sp.listStreamProcessors()

      .. output:: 
         :language: json
         :linenos:

         {
           id: '0135',
           name: "proc01",
           last_modified: ISODate("2023-03-20T20:15:54.601Z"),
           state: "RUNNING",
           error_msg: '',
           pipeline: [
             {
               $source: {
                 connectionName: "myKafka", 
                 topic: "stuff"
               }
             },
             {
               $match: { 
                 temperature: 46 
               }
             },
             {
               $emit: {
                 connectionName: "mySink",
                 topic: "output",
               }  
             }
           ],
           lastStateChange: ISODate("2023-03-20T20:15:59.442Z")
         },
         {   
           id: '0218',
           name: "proc02",
           last_modified: ISODate("2023-03-21T20:17:33.601Z"),
           state: "STOPPED",
           error_msg: '',
           pipeline: [
             {
               $source: {
                 connectionName: "myKafka", 
                 topic: "things"
               }
             },
             {
               $match: { 
                 temperature: 41 
               }
             },
             {
               $emit: {
                 connectionName: "mySink",
                 topic: "results",
               }  
             }
           ],
           lastStateChange: ISODate("2023-03-21T20:18:26.139Z")
         }

   If you run the command again on the same {+spi+}, filtering for a 
   ``"state"`` of ``"running"``, you see the following output:

   .. io-code-block::
      :copyable: true

      .. input:: 
         :language: sh

         sp.listStreamProcessors({"state": "running"})

      .. output:: 
         :language: json
         :linenos:

         {
           id: '0135',

           last_modified: ISODate("2023-03-20T20:15:54.601Z"),
           state: "RUNNING",
           error_msg: '',
           pipeline: [
             {
               $source: {
                 connectionName: "myKafka", 
                 topic: "stuff"
               }
             },
             {
               $match: { 
                 temperature: 46 
               }
             },
             {
               $emit: {
                 connectionName: "mySink",
                 topic: "output",
               }  
             }
           ],
           lastStateChange: ISODate("2023-03-20T20:15:59.442Z")
         }

.. _streams-manage-start:

Start a Stream Processor
------------------------

To start an existing stream processor with {+mongosh+}, use the 
``sp.<streamprocessor>.start()`` method. ``<streamprocessor>`` must be 
the name of a stream processor defined for the current {+spi+}.

For example, to start a stream processor named ``proc01``, run the 
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sp.proc01.start()

This method returns: 

- ``true`` if the stream processor exists and is not currently running. 

- ``false`` if you try to start a stream processor that doesn't exist, 
  or exists and is not currently running.

Stop a Stream Processor
-------------------------

To stop an existing stream processor with {+mongosh+}, use the 
``sp.<streamprocessor>.stop()`` method. ``<streamprocessor>`` must be 
the name of a currently running stream processor defined for the 
current {+spi+}.

For example, to stop a stream processor named ``proc01``, run the 
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sp.proc01.stop()

This method returns: 

- ``true`` if the stream processor exists and is currently running. 

- ``false`` if the stream processor doesn't exist, or if the stream 
  processor is not currently running.

Drop a Stream Processor
-------------------------

To delete an existing stream processor with {+mongosh+}, use the 
``sp.<streamprocessor>.drop()`` method. ``<streamprocessor>`` must be 
the name of a stream processor defined for the current {+spi+}. You 
must stop a stream processor before you can drop it.

For example, to drop a stream processor named ``proc01``, run the 
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sp.proc01.drop()

This method returns: 

- ``true`` if the stream processor exists and is currently stopped.

- ``false`` if the stream processor doesn't exist, or if the stream 
  processor is currently running. 

When you drop a stream processor, all resources that {+atlas-sp+} 
provisioned for it are destroyed, along with all saved state.

Sample from a Stream Processor
------------------------------

To return an array of sampled results from an existing stream processor 
to ``STDOUT`` with {+mongosh+}, use the 
``sp.<streamprocessor>.sample()`` method. ``<streamprocessor>`` must be 
the name of a currently running stream processor defined for the 
current {+spi+}. For example, the following command samples from a 
stream processor named ``proc01``.

.. code-block:: sh

   sp.proc01.sample()

This command runs continuously until you cancel it using ``CTRL-C``, or
until the returned samples cumulatively reach 40 MB in size.

View Statistics of a Stream Processor
-------------------------------------

To return a document summarizing the current status of an existing 
stream processor with {+mongosh+}, use the 
``sp.<streamprocessor>.stats()`` method. ``streamprocessor`` must be 
the name of a currently running stream processor defined for the 
current {+spi+}. It has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: sh

   sp.<streamprocessor>.stats({options: {<options>}})

Where ``options`` is an optional document with the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``scale``
     - integer
     - Unit to use for the size of items in the output. By default, 
       {+atlas-sp+} displays item size in bytes. To display in KB, 
       specify a ``scale`` of ``1024``.

   * - ``verbose``
     - boolean
     - Flag that specifies the verbosity level of the output document. 
       If set to ``true``, the output document contains a subdocument 
       that reports the statistics of each individual operator in your 
       pipeline. Defaults to ``false``.

The output document has the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``ns``
     - string
     - The namespace the stream processor is defined in.

   * - ``stats``
     - object
     - A document describing the operational state of the stream 
       processor.

   * - ``stats.name``
     - string
     - The name of the stream processor.

   * - ``stats.status``
     - string
     - The status of the stream processor. This field can have the
       following values:

       - ``starting``
       - ``running``
       - ``error``
       - ``stopping``

   * - ``stats.scaleFactor``
     - integer
     - The scale in which the size field displays. If set to ``1``,
       sizes display in bytes. If set to ``1024``, sizes display in
       kilobytes.

   * - ``stats.inputMessageCount``
     - integer
     - The number of documents published to the stream. A document
       is considered 'published' to the stream once it passes
       through the :pipeline:`$source` stage, not when it passes 
       through the entire pipeline.

   * - ``stats.inputMessageSize``
     - integer
     - The number of bytes or kilobytes published to the stream. 
       Bytes are considered 'published' to the stream once they pass
       through the :pipeline:`$source` stage, not when it passes
       through the entire pipeline.

   * - ``stats.outputMessageCount``
     - integer
     - The number of documents processed by the stream. A document is
       considered 'processed' by the stream once it passes through the
       entire pipeline.

   * - ``stats.outputMessageSize``
     - integer
     - The number of bytes or kilobytes processed by the stream. Bytes
       are considered 'processed' by the stream once they pass through
       the entire pipeline.

   * - ``stats.dlqMessageCount``
     - integer
     - The number of documents sent to the :ref:`atlas-sp-dlq`.

   * - ``stats.dlqMessageSize``
     - integer
     - The number of bytes or kilobytes sent to the 
       :ref:`atlas-sp-dlq`.

   * - ``stats.stateSize``
     - integer
     - The number of bytes used by windows to store processor state.

   * - ``stats.watermark``
     - integer
     - The timestamp of the current watermark.

   * - ``stats.operatorStats``
     - array
     - The statistics for each operator in the processor pipeline. 
       {+atlas-sp+} returns this field only if you pass in the 
       ``verbose`` option.
       
       ``stats.operatorStats`` provides per-operator versions of many
       core ``stats`` fields:

       - ``stats.operatorStats.name``
       - ``stats.operatorStats.inputMessageCount``
       - ``stats.operatorStats.inputMessageSize``
       - ``stats.operatorStats.outputMessageCount``
       - ``stats.operatorStats.outputMessageSize``
       - ``stats.operatorStats.dlqMessageCount``
       - ``stats.operatorStats.dlqMessageSize``
       - ``stats.operatorStats.stateSize``
        
       Additionally, ``stats.operatorStats`` includes the following
       unique fields:

       - ``stats.operatorStats.maxMemoryUsage``
       - ``stats.operatorStats.executionTime``

   * - ``stats.operatorStats.maxMemoryUsage``
     - integer
     - The maximum memory usage of the operator in bytes or kilobytes.

   * - ``stats.operatorStats.executionTime``
     - integer
     - The total execution time of the operator in seconds.

   * - ``stats.kafkaPartitions``
     - array
     - Offset information for an {+kafka+} broker's partitions. 
       ``kafkaPartitions`` applies only to connections using an 
       {+kafka+} source.
       

   * - ``stats.kafkaPartitions.partition``
     - integer
     - The {+kafka+} topic partition number.

   * - ``stats.kafkaPartitions.currentOffset``
     - integer
     - The offset that the stream processor is on for the
       specified partition. This value equals the previous offset
       that the stream processor processed plus ``1``.

   * - ``stats.kafkaPartitions.checkpointOffset``
     - integer
     - The offset that the stream processor last committed to the
       {+kafka+} broker and the checkpoint for the specified
       partition. All messages through this offset are 
       recorded in the last checkpoint.

For example, the following shows the status of a stream processor named 
``proc01`` on a {+spi+} named ``inst01`` with item sizes displayed in 
KB:

.. code-block:: sh

   sp.proc01.stats(1024)

   {
     ok: 1,
     ns: 'inst01',
     stats: {
       name: 'proc01',
       status: 'running',
       scaleFactor: Long("1"), 
       inputMessageCount: Long("706028"),
       inputMessageSize: 958685236,
       outputMessageCount: Long("46322"),
       outputMessageSize: 85666332,
       dlqMessageCount: Long("0"),
       dlqMessageSize: Long("0"),
       stateSize: Long("2747968"),
       watermark: ISODate("2023-12-14T14:35:32.417Z"),
       ok: 1
     },
   }
