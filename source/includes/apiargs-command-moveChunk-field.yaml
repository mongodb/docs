  An equality match on the shard key that specifies the shard-key value
  of the chunk to move. Specify either the ``bounds`` field or the
  ``find`` field but not both. Do **not** use the ``find`` field to
  select chunks in collections that use a :term:`hashed shard key`.

arg_name: field

  The bounds of a specific chunk to move. The array must consist of two
  documents that specify the lower and upper shard key values of a chunk
  to move. Specify either the ``bounds`` field or the ``find`` field but
  not both. Use ``bounds`` to select chunks in collections that use a
  :term:`hashed shard key`.

  Defaults to ``true``. When ``true``, the balancer waits
  for replication to :term:`secondaries <secondary>` when it copies
  and deletes data during chunk migrations. For details, see

  A document that expresses the :doc:`write concern
  </reference/write-concern>` that the ``_secondaryThrottle`` will use to
  wait for secondaries during the chunk migration. Any specified
  ``writeConcern`` implies ``_secondaryThrottle`` and will take
  precedent over a contradictory ``_secondaryThrottle`` setting.

  Internal option for testing purposes. The default is ``false``. If set
