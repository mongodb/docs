     - Displays the following information:

       - :guilabel:`ASSERT_REGULAR` displays the average rate of 
         regular asserts raised per second over the selected sample 
         period. 
        
       - :guilabel:`ASSERT_WARNING` displays the average rate of 
         warnings per second over the selected sample period.
        
       - :guilabel:`ASSERT_MSG` displays the average rate of message 
         asserts per second over the selected sample period. These 
         internal server errors have a well-defined text string. 
         |service| logs stack traces for these.
       
       - :guilabel:`ASSERT_USER` displays the average rate of user 
         asserts per second over the selected sample period. This 
         metric includes asserts that a user generates, such as out of 
         disk space or duplicate key errors.
     
       Monitor asserts to track how many errors occur while trying to 
       read or write data. Check the server logs to identify the source 
       of any errors.
   
   * - :guilabel:`Avg Object Size`
     
     - Displays the average object size across all collections in the 
       database.

       Monitor object size to track the size of your objects and better 
       understand your database space.

   * - :guilabel:`Cache Activity`

     - Displays the following information:

       - :guilabel:`readInto` (replica set) or 
         :guilabel:`cache read into` (sharded cluster) displays the 
         rate in bytes per second of data read from disk into memory to 
         service queries.

       - :guilabel:`writtenFrom` (replica set) or
         :guilabel:`cache written from` (sharded cluster) displays the 
         rate in bytes per second of data written from memory into disk 
         to service writes.

       .. include:: /includes/fact-cache-activity.rst

   * - :guilabel:`Cache Ratio`

     - Displays cache fill ratio and dirty fill ratio metrics.
  
       *Cache Fill Ratio* measures how well a cache can serve requests.
       It is calculated by dividing the number of bytes currently in the
       cache by the maximum number of bytes configured, represented as a
       percentage. A high cache fill ratio indicates that most data
       requests are being served from memory, leading to faster query
       performance and reduced disk I/O. 

       *Dirty Fill Ratio* represents the proportion of dirty bytes,
       which are pages modified in memory but not yet written to disk,
       relative to the total cache. A high dirty fill ratio suggests
       that a significant amount of data is waiting to be flushed to
       disk, which can impact performance. Use this metric when
       monitoring write-heavy workloads to ensure data durability. 

   * - :guilabel:`Cache Usage`

     - Displays the following information:

       - :guilabel:`dirty` (replica set) or :guilabel:`cache dirty`

       - :guilabel:`used` (replica set) or :guilabel:`cache used` 
         (sharded cluster) displays the total bytes cached in memory 
         for serving reads and writes.
    
       These metrics include both indexes and data from the working 
       set.

       ``ttldeleted`` from :manual:`TTL indexes </core/index-ttl>` only occur 
       against a node in a ``PRIMARY`` state and are replicated as standard deletes to the 
       secondary nodes. Because of this, TTL deletes aren't applicable on secondaries. |service|  
       maintains the history of the previous primary member's TTL deletes and the TTL deletes 
       remain visible on secondaries that had previously served as the primary member.

       |service| collects this data at 85-second intervals regardless
       of your project's default granularity level.

   * - :guilabel:`Replication Oplog Window`
   
     - Displays the estimated average number of hours of database 
       operations available in the primary's replication oplog, based 
       on oplog churn. If replication lag on a secondary node exceeds 
       the replication oplog window, and replication headroom reaches 
       zero, a :manual:`full resync 
       </tutorial/resync-replica-set-member/>` is required for that 
       node to become healthy again.

       Monitor the replication oplog window, together with replication 
       headroom, to determine whether the secondary may soon require a 
       full resync. The replication oplog window often helps to 
       determine in advance the resilience of secondaries to planned 
       and unplanned outages.

   * - :guilabel:`Scan and Order`

        stored data uses on each shard. You can access this chart only 
        for sharded clusters with MongoDB 6.0+.

        .. include:: /includes/fact-balanced-shards.rst

   * - :guilabel:`Shard Document Count`

     - Displays the number of documents on each shard. You can access 
       this chart only for sharded clusters with MongoDB 6.0+.

     - Displays :guilabel:`spill to disk during sort`, 
       the total number of writes to disk caused by 
       :pipeline:`$sort` stages.

       A high :guilabel:`spill to disk during sort` 
       number might be due to resource-intensive queries 
       that are performing a :term:`collection scan` and are using a 
       ``$sort`` stage. These resource-intensive queries result in temporary 
       file creation that exceed available memory and utilize disk 
       pace for sorting. Identify offending queries in the 
       :ref:`Query Profiler <query-profiler>` by looking for 
       collection scans with a ``$sort`` stage around the same 
       time the database experiences an increase in disk usage.

   * - :guilabel:`Tickets Available`

     - Displays the following information:

       - :guilabel:`Tickets Available Read` displays the number of read 
         tickets available to the WiredTiger storage engine. Read 
         tickets represent the number of concurrent read operations 
         allowed into the storage engine. When this value reaches zero, 
         new read requests might queue until a read ticket becomes 
         available.

       - :guilabel:`Tickets Available Write` displays the number of 
         write tickets available to the WiredTiger storage engine. 
         Write tickets represent the number of concurrent write 
         operations allowed into the storage engine. When this value 
         reaches zero, new write requests might queue until a write 
         ticket becomes available.

       Monitor the tickets available to see when read and write 
       requests queue.
