Overview
--------

MongoDB |service| supports private endpoints on {+dedicated-clusters+}
and {+serverless-instances+}. Select your {+database-deployment+} type
to learn which cloud providers |service| supports:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: {+Dedicated-Clusters+}
      :tabid: clusters

      - |aws| using the `{+aws-pl+} 
        <https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/>`__ feature.

      - |azure| using the `{+az-pl+} 
        <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/private-link/>`__
        feature.

      - |gcp| using the `{+gcp-psc+} 
        <https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect>`__
        feature.

      You can also set up private endpoints for your Online Archive. To 
      learn more, see :ref:`oa-config-private-endpoint`.

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: {+aws-pl+}
            :tabid: {+aws-pl+}

            When you enable this feature, |service| creates its own 
            |vpc| and places {+database-deployments+} within a region
            behind a network load balancer in the |service| |vpc|.

            Then you create resources that establish a one-way
            connection from your |vpc| to the network load balancer in
            the |service| |vpc| using a private endpoint.

            .. tabs::

               .. tab:: {+aws-pl+}

                           connections from your application VPC to
                           resources in the |service| VPC.

               .. tab:: {+aws-pl+} with Direct Connect
                  :tabid: aws-pl-directconnect-diagram

                     :alt: Image showing how you can use |aws| Direct
                           Connect to establish a transitive
                           connection from your data center to a
                           peered |aws| VPC to resources in the 
                           |service| VPC using |aws| Direct Connect.

         .. tab:: {+az-pl+}
            :tabid: {+az-pl+}

            When you enable this feature, |service| creates a Private 
            Link service and places clusters within a region behind a 
            load balancer in the |service| VNet.

            Then you create resources that establish a one-way 
            connection from your VNet to the :azure:`Private Link 
            service </private-link/private-link-service-overview>` in 
            the |service| VNet using a private endpoint. The Private 
            Link service routes traffic to the load balancer that 
            fronts the clusters in the |service| VNet.

            .. include:: /includes/fact-private-endpoint-connections-azure.rst

         .. tab:: {+gcp-psc+}
            :tabid: {+gcp-psc+}

            When you enable {+gcp-psc+} in |gcp|, |service|
            creates a private endpoint service using :gcp:`service attachments 
            </vpc/docs/private-service-connect#service-attachments>`
            and load balancers.
      
            Next, you create resources that establish a one-way 
            connection from your |vpc| to the private endpoint service 
            in |service| using a private endpoint. The private endpoint 
            service routes traffic to the load balancers for the 
            {+clusters+} in the |service| |vpc|.

            To ensure the availability of resources for both current 
            and future {+clusters+}, |service| performs the following 
            actions when you enable this feature:

            .. include:: /includes/gcp-psc-connection-workflow.rst

            .. tabs::

               .. tab:: One Cluster, One Region
                  :tabid: gcp-psc-one-cluster

                  The following diagram shows how {+gcp-psc+}
                  establishes connections when you have one {+cluster+}
                  in one region.

                     :alt: Image showing how {+gcp-psc+} establishes   
                           connections from your application VPC to
                           resources in the |service| VPC when you have
                           one cluster in one region. Lighter colored
                           lines represent potential connections to
                           addresses that |service| reserves.

               .. tab:: Multiple Clusters, One Region
                  :tabid: gcp-psc-two-clusters

                  The following diagram shows how {+gcp-psc+}
                  establishes connections when you have two 
                  {+clusters+} in one region.

                  .. figure:: /images/google-psc-diagram-two-clusters.svg
                     :width: 720px

                           connections from your application VPC to
                           resources in the |service| VPC when you have
                           two clusters in one region. Lighter colored
                           lines represent potential connections to
                           addresses that |service| reserves.
               

            Connections to |service| clusters using private endpoints 
            offer the following advantages over other network access 
            management options:

            - Connections to private endpoints are one-way. |service| 
              |vpc|\s can't initiate connections back to your |gcp| 
              |vpc|\s. This ensures your perceived network trust 
              boundary is not extended. 
            - You can connect to private endpoints within your |vpc| 
              transitively from an on-premises data center connected 
              with Google Cloud VPN to the private endpoint-connected 
              |vpc|. This enables you to connect to |service| directly 
              from your on-premises data center without adding public IP
              addresses to the |service| access list.

            |service| services are accessed through

            ports can change under specific circumstances, including 
            (but not limited to) cluster changes.

            .. important::
               MongoDB strongly recommends using the DNS seedlist 
               private endpoint-aware connection string, so that DNS 
               automatically updates the ports that {+gcp-psc+} uses if
               they change. For the same reason, MongoDB also strongly 
               recommends allow-listing the entire port range, instead
               of specific ports.

            - {+aws-pl+} must be active in all regions into which you 
              deploy a multi-region {+cluster+}. You will receive an 
              error if {+aws-pl+} is active in some, but not all, 
              targeted regions. If you have a multi-cloud {+cluster+} 
              in |aws| or |azure|, you must provision an endpoint in 
              each provider or region. 

            - You can do only one of the following:

              - Create more than one private endpoint in a single 
                region.
              - Create no more than one private endpoint per region, if 
                nodes are deployed in more than one region.

                   This limitation applies across cloud providers. For
                   example, if you create more than one private 
                   endpoint in a single region in |aws|, you can't

              - Create one group of private endpoints in multiple 
                regions.

                .. important::

                   This limitation applies across cloud providers. For
                   example, if you create more than one private 
                   endpoint in a single region in |gcp|, you can't 
                   create private endpoints in more than one region in 
                   |aws|.

              See :ref:`atlas_regionalized-pl` for an exception for
              multi-region and global sharded clusters.

            - You can have up to 50 nodes when you create |service| projects 
              that use {+gcp-psc+} in a **single region**. If you need more 
              than 50 nodes, perform one of the following actions:

              - Contact :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>`
              - Use additional projects or regions to connect to nodes 
                beyond this limit

              .. note::

                 Each private endpoint in |gcp| reserves an IP address 
                 within your |gcp| |vpc| and forwards traffic from the 
                 endpoints' IP addresses to the 
                 :gcp:`service attachments </vpc/docs/private-service-connect#service-attachments>`.
                 You must create an equal number of private endpoints 
                 to the number of service attachments. The number of 
                 service attachments defaults to 50.

              .. note::

                 To request a one-time increase to use {+gcp-psc+} with 
                 up to 100 nodes per |service| project, contact
                 :ref:`MongoDB Support <request-support>`.

            - You can have up to 40 nodes when you create |service| projects 
              that use {+gcp-psc+} across **multiple regions**. This total 
              excludes the following instances:

              - |gcp| regions communicating with each other
              - {+Free-clusters+} or {+shared-clusters+}
           
            - |gcp| {+google-psc+} supports up to 1024 outgoing 
              connections per virtual machine. As a result, you can't 
              have more than 1024 connections from a single |gcp| 
              virtual machine to an |service| cluster.

              To learn more, see the |gcp|
              :gcp:`cloud NAT documentation 
              </nat/docs/ports-and-addresses>`.

            - |gcp| {+google-psc+} is region-specific. You cannot use 
              |vpc| peering to access private endpoints from a 
              different |vpc|.

              When using {+google-psc+} to connect to multi-region
              {+clusters+}, you can connect only to {+cluster+} nodes 
              that are in the same region as the private endpoint. If 
              the endpoint and the primary node are in different 
              regions, you must:

              1. Set your application's
                 :manual:`read preference </core/read-preference/>`
                 to allow connections from a secondary node.

                 For example, you can set your application's read 
                 preferencento :manual:`secondaryPreferred </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-secondaryPreferred>`.

              2. Ensure at least one secondary node is in the same 
                 region as the endpoint.

      - If this is the first private endpoint that you deploy to a
        region, you must first resume any paused 
        {+database-deployments+} in your project with nodes deployed to
        that region. This limitation doesn't apply for additional
        private  endpoints that you deploy to the same region.

            :tabid: {+az-pl+}

      - Private endpoints for {+serverless-instances+} apply at the 
        {+database-deployment+} level. If you configure a private
        endpoint for a {+serverless-instance+}, that private endpoint 
        can't be used for other {+serverless-instances+} or {+clusters+}
        in the same project. You must configure a separate private endpoint for each {+serverless-instance+}.

      - You can connect up to two private endpoints per 
        {+serverless-instance+}.

Prerequisites
-------------

To enable connections to |service| using private endpoints, you must:

- Have a valid payment method already configured for your organization.

            1. Have either the :authrole:`Project Owner` or
               :authrole:`Organization Owner` role in |service|.

            #. Have a |gcp| user account with an |iam| user policy and 
               a :gcp:`Compute Network Admin 
               </iam/docs/understanding-roles#compute.networkAdmin>`
               role that grants permissions to create, modify, and 
               delete networking resources. For more information on 
               managing private endpoints and connections, see the
               :gcp:`GCP documentation </vpc/docs/overview.html>`.

            #. :gcp:`Install gcloud CLI </sdk/docs/install>`.

            #. If you have not already done so, create your |vpc| and 
               Compute instances in |gcp|. See the :gcp:`GCP 
               documentation </vpc/docs/using-vpc.html>` for guidance.

            #. Make sure egress firewall rules permit traffic to the 
               internal IP address of the {+gcp-psc+} endpoint.
         
            #. (Optional) If you enforce a security perimeter with 
               |vpc| service controls (VPC-SC), you must create ingress 
               and egress rules to establish the connection between the 
               {+gcp-psc+} endpoint and |service| {+clusters+}. See the 
               :gcp:`GCP documentation </vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-services#vpc-sc>` 
               for guidance.
