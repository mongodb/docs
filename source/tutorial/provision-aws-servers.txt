Overview
--------

|mms| integrates with Amazon Web Services (AWS) so that you can provision
servers directly from the |mms| interface. When you provision servers,
|mms| automatically installs the Automation Agent on each, making them
available to host MongoDB deployments.

In general, provision one server per :program:`mongod` process. For
MongoDB deployment architectures, see :manual:`Replica Set Architectures
</core/replica-set-architectures>` and :manual:`Sharded Cluster
Architectures </core/sharded-cluster-architectures>` in the MongoDB
manual.

Prerequisites
-------------

You or an administrator must :doc:`configure integration with AWS
</tutorial/configure-aws-integration>`.

You must have at least one SSH public key stored on the :guilabel:`Provisioning Settings`
page, accessed through :guilabel:`Settings`.
|mms| requires this key whether or not you provision Linux servers.
