Overview
--------

A project provides access to a distinct deployment of MongoDB clusters, replica
sets and standalone processes. Users must be members of a project to access the
project's deployment. When you register as a new |mms| user, you must choose
whether to join an existing project or create a new one.

The user who creates a project automatically has the :ref:`Owner
<owner-role>` role for the project and can manage user access.

You can create multiple projects. Each project has its own Monitoring,
Backup and Automation Agents associated with the project. For a project,
the Monitoring Agent must be able to connect to all hosts it monitors.
If you have segregated environments separated by firewalls, you must
create separate |mms| projects for each environment.

Working with Multiple Environments
----------------------------------

If you have multiple MongoDB systems in distinct environments and cannot
monitor all systems with a single agent, you will need to add a new project.
Having a second project makes it possible to run two agents.

You may also use a second project and agent to monitor a different set of
MongoDB instances in the same environment if you want to segregate the hosts
within the |mms| console. A user can only view data from the hosts monitored in
a single project at once.

After adding a second project, the |mms| interface will have a drop-down list that
will allow you to change projects. Selecting a new project will refresh the
current page with the data available from the servers in this project.

Create a Project
----------------

Choose a name for your project. |mms| automatically adds you as the first
user to the project and assigns the project a set of default :doc:`alert configurations
</tutorial/manage-alert-configurations>`.
