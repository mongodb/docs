ref: projection-path-collision-embedded-document-full
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, it is illegal to project an embedded
   document with any of the embedded document's fields.

   For example, consider a collection ``inventory`` with documents that
   contain a ``size`` field:
  
   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { ..., size: { h: 10, w: 15.25, uom: "cm" }, ... }

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following operation fails with a ``Path
   collision`` error because it attempts to project both ``size`` document
   and the ``size.uom`` field:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.inventory.find( {}, { size: 1, "size.uom": 1 } )  // Invalid starting in 4.4

   In previous versions, lattermost projection between the embedded
   documents and its fields determines the projection:

   - If the projection of the embedded document comes after any and all
     projections of its fields, MongoDB projects the embedded document.
     For example, the projection document ``{ "size.uom": 1, size: 1 }``
     produces the same result as the projection document ``{ size: 1 }``.

   - If the projection of the embedded document comes before the
     projection any of its fields, MongoDB projects the specified field or
     fields. For example, the projection document ``{ "size.uom": 1, size:
     1, "size.h": 1 }`` produces the same result as the projection
     document ``{ "size.uom": 1, "size.h": 1 }``.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, |findoperation| projection
   cannot contain both a :projection:`$slice` of an array and a field
   embedded in the array. 

   For example, consider a collection ``inventory`` that contains an array
   field ``instock``:
  
   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      { ..., instock: [ { warehouse: "A", qty: 35 }, { warehouse: "B", qty: 15 }, { warehouse: "C", qty: 35 } ], ... }

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following operation fails with a ``Path
   collision`` error:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.inventory.find( {}, { "instock": { $slice: 1 }, "instock.warehouse": 0 } ) // Invalid starting in 4.4

   In previous versions, the projection applies both projections and
   returns the first element (``$slice: 1``) in the ``instock`` array
   but suppresses the ``warehouse`` field in the projected element.
   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, to achieve the same result, use the
   :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method with two separate
   :pipeline:`$project` stages.

ref: projection-dollar-prefixed-field-full
content: |

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, the |findoperation| projection cannot
   project a field that starts with ``$`` with the exception of the
   :ref:`DBRef fields <dbref-explanation>`.

   For example, starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following operation is
   invalid:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.inventory.find( {}, { "$instock.warehouse": 0, "$item": 0, "detail.$price": 1 } ) // Invalid starting in 4.4

   MongoDB already has a :limit:`restriction <Restrictions on Field Names>`
   where top-level field names cannot start with the dollar sign
   (``$``). 

   In earlier version, MongoDB ignores the ``$``-prefixed field
   projections.

   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, |findoperation| projection
   cannot include :projection:`$slice` projection expression as part of a
   :projection:`$` projection expression. 
   
   For example, starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following operation is
   invalid:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.inventory.find( { "instock.qty": { $gt: 25 } }, { "instock.$": { $slice: 1 } } ) // Invalid starting in 4.4

   MongoDB already has a :limit:`restriction <Restrictions on Field
   Names>` where top-level field names cannot start with the dollar sign
   (``$``). 

   In previous versions, MongoDB returns the first element
   (``instock.$``) in the ``instock`` array that matches the query
   condition; i.e. the positional projection ``"instock.$"`` takes
   precedence and the ``$slice:1`` is a no-op. The ``"instock.$": {
   $slice: 1 }`` does not exclude any other document field.

ref: projection-empty-field-full
content: |
   Starting in MongoDB 4.4, |findoperation| projection
   cannot include a projection of an empty field name. 

   For example, starting in MongoDB 4.4, the following operation is
   invalid:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :copyable: false

      db.inventory.find( { }, { "": 0 } ) // Invalid starting in 4.4

   In previous versions, MongoDB treats the inclusion/exclusion of the
   empty field as it would the projection of non-existing fields.
