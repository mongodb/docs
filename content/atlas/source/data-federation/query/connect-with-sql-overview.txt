   :description: Use MongoDB SQL to query data in your MongoDB database with Business Intelligence tools, such as Tableau and Power BI. The connections to the BI tools run over ODBC or JDBC drivers.

.. |interface| replace:: SQL Interface

The {+sql-interface+} for {+service+} and :product:`Enterprise Advanced (EA) <self-managed/enterprise-advanced>` 
lets non-developers query MongoDB data from the SQL tools they already use. 
It provides live, read-only access over standard |odbc| and |jdbc| connections, 
eliminating the need to learn {+mql+} or move data out of MongoDB for analytics. 
This simplifies operational reporting, accelerates insights, and ensures data 
remains accurate and consistent. 

Supported Versions
------------------

The {+sql-interface+} supports connections from:

- **{+service+} Clusters:** MongoDB 5.0 and later.

- **Self-Managed EA Clusters:** MongoDB 6.0 and later.

{+sql-interface+} Components
----------------------------

The {+sql-interface+} deployment consists of four components:

- Your |bi| visualization and reporting tool used to analyze data, such as 
  `Tableau <https://www.tableau.com/>`__ or 
  `Power BI <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi>`__.

- A |jdbc| or |odbc| driver that connects your |bi| tool to your MongoDB database. 
  The driver you select depends on your |bi| tool. 

- The {+schema-builder+} that manages the JSON schema required to translate SQL 
  queries between your |bi| tool and MongoDB database. In {+service+}, the {+schema-builder+}
  is built-in to the {+atlas-ui+}. For self-managed EA deployments, you download 
  the {+schema-builder+} as a CLI tool.

- A MongoDB database where your data resides, either an {+service+} cluster or a 
  self-managed EA database.


Key Benefits of the MongoDB SQL Interface
-----------------------------------------

**Schema Improvements**
   Experience significantly improved schema computations that adapt to your 
   data. There's no need for cumbersome schema files as MongoSQL dynamically 
   derives schemas on-the-fly and stores them in the database for easy retrieval. 
   The schema mapping is very accurate with no sampling.

**Simple & Secure** 
   Enjoy a simplified setup with no complex proxy configurations, allowing you 
   to connect directly to your MongoDB cluster. It offers robust authentication 
   with support for X509 and OIDC protocols.

**First-class SQL Experience**
   Leverage rich objects and arrays with native driver support, enhancing your 
   data interactions. Server restarts are seamless, ensuring uninterrupted 
   operations and high availability. The interface uses MongoSQL, a 
   MongoDB-Native SQL-92 compatible dialect, which supports complex transformations 
   like flattening nested objects and unwinding arrays directly within SQL queries.

**Unified Access**
   Provides the same drivers, connectors, and schema mapping for Atlas Cloud, 
   Atlas Data Federation, and self-managed EA databases.

**BI Tool Integration**
   The Power BI Connector is certified by Microsoft and the Tableau Connector 
   is developed in partnership with Tableau. It supports Power BI with 
   DirectQuery and Tableau Desktop, Tableau Server, and Tableau Prep. Tableau 
   Cloud support is expected in the first half of 2025.

MongoDB {+sql-interface+} Compatibility Considerations
------------------------------------------------------

When using the {+sql-interface+}, consider the following points to ensure 
your setup is compatible and up-to-date:

* There is no official :abbr:`EOL (End of Life)` for {+sql-interface+} components,       
  including drivers, connectors, and the {+schema-builder+}.
  Instead, their lifecycle is tied to the compatibility of the MongoDB server versions 
  and language runtimes they are designed to work with.

* {+sql-interface+} components
  remain compatible with a MongoDB server version for up to 3 years after that server 
  version's :abbr:`EOL (End of Life)`. To learn more, see 
  `MongoDB Software Lifecycle Schedules <https://www.mongodb.com/legal/support-policy/lifecycles>`__.

* We recommend upgrading your {+sql-interface+} components to the latest version, 
  especially when upgrading your MongoDB server. This ensures access to new features, 
  performance enhancements, and long-term compatibility. To see the latest versions, 
  go to the `MongoDB download center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/sql-interface>`__.

* Later versions of {+sql-interface+} components might drop support for earlier 
  MongoDB server versions 
  or specific language runtimes, such as Node.js versions. We recommend reviewing 
  the :ref:`sql-release-notes` to stay informed about compatibility changes and 
  upgrade requirements.

Legacy Options
--------------

The |bic-full| is the legacy tool for connecting |bi| analytics tools to a MongoDB 
database or cluster. The |bic-short-no-link| reaches **End-of-Life (EOL) in September 2026**.
