   Select values from these two dropdown menus:

   .. list-table::
     :widths: 30 70

     * - Menu

       - Possible and Default Values

     * - :guilabel:`Sync source`

       - This can be *any* secondary (Ops Manager chooses) or any
         specific secondary or the primary node.

         The default value (``any secondary``) is preferred because it
         minimizes performance impact on the primary.

     * - :guilabel:`Storage Engine`

       - This can be either :guilabel:`MongoDB Memory Mapped Files` or
         :guilabel:`WiredTiger`, but the default value is the same
         storage engine as the primary node of the database being
         backed up.

         See the considerations in
         :ref:`Storage Engines <considerations-backup-storage-engine>`.
