The balancer is a process that runs on *one* of the :binary:`~bin.mongos`
instances in a cluster and ensures that :term:`chunks <chunk>` are
evenly distributed throughout a sharded cluster. In most deployments,
the default balancer configuration is sufficient for normal
operation. However, administrators might need to modify balancer
behavior depending on application or operational requirements. If you
encounter a situation where you need to modify the behavior of the
balancer, use the procedures described in this document.

For conceptual information about the balancer, see
:ref:`sharding-balancing` and :ref:`sharding-balancing-internals`.

.. _sharded-cluster-config-balancing-window:

Schedule a Window of Time for Balancing to Occur
------------------------------------------------

You can schedule a window of time during which the balancer can
migrate chunks, as described in the following procedures:

- :ref:`sharding-schedule-balancing-window`

- :ref:`sharding-balancing-remove-window`.

The :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances user their own local timezones to when
respecting balancer window.

.. _sharded-cluster-config-default-chunk-size:

Configure Default Chunk Size
----------------------------

The default chunk size for a sharded cluster is 64 megabytes. In most
situations, the default size is appropriate for splitting and migrating
chunks. For information on how chunk size affects deployments, see
details, see :ref:`sharding-chunk-size`.

Changing the default chunk size affects chunks that are processes during
migrations and auto-splits but does not retroactively affect all chunks.

To configure default chunk size, see :ref:`sharding-balancing-modify-chunk-size`.

.. _sharded-cluster-config-max-shard-size:

Change the Maximum Storage Size for a Given Shard
-------------------------------------------------

The ``maxSize`` field in the :data:`~config.shards` collection in the
:ref:`config database <config-database>` sets the maximum size for a
shard, allowing you to control whether the balancer will migrate chunks
to a shard. If :data:`~dbStats.dataSize` is above a shard's
``maxSize``, the balancer will not move chunks to the shard. Also, the
balancer will not move chunks off an overloaded shard. This must happen
manually. The ``maxSize`` value only affects the balancer's selection of
destination shards.

By default, ``maxSize`` is not specified, allowing shards to consume the
total amount of available space on their machines if necessary.

You can set ``maxSize`` both when adding a shard and once a shard is
running.

To set ``maxSize`` when adding a shard, set the :dbcommand:`addShard`
command's ``maxSize`` parameter to the maximum size in megabytes. For
example, the following command run in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell adds a
shard with a maximum size of 125 megabytes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.runCommand( { addshard : "example.net:34008", maxSize : 125 } )

To set ``maxSize`` on an existing shard, insert or update the
``maxSize`` field in the :data:`~config.shards` collection in the
:ref:`config database <config-database>`. Set the ``maxSize`` in
megabytes.

.. example::

   Assume you have the following shard without a ``maxSize`` field:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id" : "shard0000", "host" : "example.net:34001" }

   Run the following sequence of commands in the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
   to insert a ``maxSize`` of 125 megabytes:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config
      db.shards.update( { _id : "shard0000" }, { $set : { maxSize : 125 } } )

   To later increase the ``maxSize`` setting to 250 megabytes, run the
   following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      use config
      db.shards.update( { _id : "shard0000" }, { $set : { maxSize : 250 } } )

.. index:: secondary throttle
.. _sharded-cluster-config-secondary-throttle:

Require Replication before Chunk Migration (Secondary Throttle)
---------------------------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.2.1

By default, the write operations required to migrate chunks between
shards do not need to replicate to secondaries in order to
succeed. However, you can configure the balancer to require migration
related write operations to replicate to secondaries. This throttles
or slows the migration process and in doing so reduces the potential
impact of migrations on a sharded cluster.

You can throttle migrations by enabling the balancer's
``_secondaryThrottle`` parameter. When enabled, secondary throttle
requires a ``{ w : 2 }`` write concern on delete and insertion
operations, so that every operation propagates to at least one
secondary before the balancer issues the next operation.

.. BACKGROUND NOTES
   Specifically, secondary throttle affects the first and fourth
   phases (informal phases) of chunk migration. Migration can happen during
   the second and third phases (the "steady state"):
   1) copies the documents in the chunk from shardA to shardB
   2) continues to copy over ongoing changes that occurred during the initial copy step,
      as well as current changes to that chunk range
   3) Stop writes, allow shardB to get final changes, commit migration to config server
   4) cleanup now-inactive data on shardA in chunk range (once all cursors are done)

You enable ``_secondaryThrottle`` directly in the
:data:`~config.settings` collection in the :ref:`config database
<config-database>` by running the following commands from the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use config
   db.settings.update( { "_id" : "balancer" } , { $set : { "_secondaryThrottle" : true } , { upsert : true } } )

You also can enable secondary throttle when issuing the
:dbcommand:`moveChunk` command by setting ``_secondaryThrottle`` to
``true``. For more information, see :dbcommand:`moveChunk`.
