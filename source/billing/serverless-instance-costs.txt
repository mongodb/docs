{+Serverless-instances+} offer pay-per-operation pricing, meaning that 
you only pay for the Processing Units consumed by your database 
operations and storage consumed by your data and indexes. You do not 
need to specify a cluster size since serverless instances seamlessly 
scale to accommodate changes in workload traffic.

{+Serverless-instances+} 
may be more cost effective for applications with low or intermittent 
traffic. To learn more about {+Serverless-instances+} and use cases, 
see :ref:`Choose a {+Database-Deployment+} Type <ref-deployment-types>`.

.. note::
  
   :manual:`Expiration operations </core/index-ttl/#behavior>` 
   triggered by :manual:`TTL Indexes </core/index-ttl/>` might generate 
   ``RPU``\s and ``WPU``\s . The volume of these additional processing
   units typically incurs only a small fee relative to your overall 
   costs.

Usage Cost Summary
----------------------

Operation pricing varies between cloud providers and geographic 
regions. All operations are billed *per day*.

.. LK 6/3/22 - The intended final source of truth for this pricing info
   is the Atlas UI itself; as of today, this information is not accessible
   without special configuration.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 40 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Description
     - Price

   * - Read Processing Unit (``RPU``)
     - Read operations to the database.
       
       |service| calculates RPUs based on the number of read
       operations, document bytes
       read (in 4KB increments), and index bytes read (in 256
       byte increments) per operation. RPUs are calculated on
       a daily basis and start at 0 each day.
      
     - The price for each million ``RPU``\s decreases based on volume 
       of reads in a day. Starting prices range from 
       $0.09 to $0.22 per million ``RPU``\s.
       [#prorated]_ 
       See :ref:`rpu-pricing` for price tier details.

   * - Write Processing Unit (``WPU``)
     - Write operations to the database.

       |service| calculates WPUs based on document bytes and index
       bytes written (up to 1KB). If a document and index exceed 1KB, 
       |service| covers each excess chunk of 1KB with an additional WPU.
       |service| calculates WPUs on a daily basis and WPUs start at 0
       each day.

     - Range from $0.90 to $2.20 per million ``WPU``\s.
       [#prorated]_

   * - Storage
     - Logical document and index storage. This value includes the 
       number of bytes of all uncompressed BSON documents stored in all 
       collections, plus the bytes stored in their associated indexes.
     - Range from $0.20 to $0.70 per ``GB`` per month.

   * - Continuous Backup
     - Point-in-Time backups triggered by write events.
     - Range from $0.20 to $0.60 per ``GB`` per month.

   * - Restore from Backup
     - The time required to restore your serverless instance.

       :gold:`IMPORTANT:` Data transfer as part of the backup and restore process is 
       charged separately.

     - Range from $2.50 to $6.00 per restore hour.

   * - Data Transfer
     - Data transfer to and from the database. [#prorated]_
     
       If your data transfer costs are a significant portion of your 
       bill, see :ref:`reducing-data-transfer-costs`.

     -

       - Regional: $0.01 per ``GB`` for *all* cloud providers and 
         regions.

       - Cross-Region: range from $0.02 to $0.20 per ``GB``.

       - Public Internet: range from $0.09 to $0.20 per ``GB``.

.. LK - 6/2/22 - Footnote about prorating must be included in the left
   column; if it's included with the list items in the right column, it
   will cause formatting errors and the only way to circumvent them
   is to put all the text on a single line of source regardless of the
   72 character rule.

.. [#prorated]

   ``RPU`` and ``WPU`` prices are presented *per million*, but you are 
   only charged for the amount you use. For example, if ``WPU``\s 
   cost $1.25 per million in your region; using 500,000 would cost 
   $0.63. The same is true for data transfer: you're only charged for 
   the amount you transfer.

Read Processing Unit Pricing 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The price for each million (M) ``RPU``\s depends on volume of reads 
that day. ``RPU``\s start at 0 each day. Prices are in cascading 
tiers:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 50 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Tier 
     - Description
     - Price

   * - 0-50 M ``RPU``\s 
     - The first 50 million ``RPU``\s in a day.
     - $0.09 to $0.22/M

   * - 50-550 M ``RPU``\s 
     - The next 500 million ``RPU``\s in a day.
     - $0.05 to $0.11/M
   
   * - 550 M-20.55 B ``RPU``\s 
     - The next 20 billion ``RPU``\s in a day.
     - $0.01 to $0.03/M
   
   * - 20.55+ B ``RPU``\s 
     - All subsequent ``RPU``\s in a day.
     - Free

.. example::
   
   If your application uses 560 million ``RPU``\s in a day, in a region
   with prices of $0.10/M, $0.06/M, and $0.02/M by tier, |service| 
   charges you $35.20:

   - $0.10/M for the first 50 million ($5.00).

   - $0.06/M for the next 500 million ($30.00).

   - $0.02/M for the last 10 million ($0.20).

   If that usage is typical for a day, your application costs 
   approximately $1056 per month ($35.20 per day x 30 days).

   In another example, if your application uses 0.5 million ``RPU``\s 
   in a day in the same region, |service| charges you $0.05:

   - $0.10/M for the first 0.5 million ($0.05).

   If that usage is typical for a day, your application costs 
   approximately $1.50 per month ($0.05 per day x 30 days).

Payment Methods
---------------

.. warning::
   
   An unexpected, significant increase in {+Serverless-instance+} usage 
   could result in an expensive invoice. Use 
   :ref:`billing alerts <billing-alerts>` to monitor usage.

You can pay for {+Serverless-instances+} with:

- A :ref:`payment method <payment-method>` added through the |service| 
  console,

- an |service| 
  :ref:`subscription <atlas-subscriptions>`, or
