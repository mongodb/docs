Most UNIX-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS, provide
ways to limit and control the usage of system resources such as
threads, files, and network connections on a per-process and per-user
basis. These "ulimits" prevent single users from using too many system
resources. Sometimes, these limits have low default values that can
cause a number of issues in the course of normal MongoDB operation.

.. _system-resource-utilization:

Resource Utilization
--------------------

:binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` each use threads and file
descriptors to track connections and manage internal operations. This
section outlines the general resource utilization patterns for MongoDB.
Use these figures in combination with the actual information about your
deployment and its use to determine ideal ``ulimit`` settings.

Generally, all :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances:

- track each incoming connection with two file descriptors *and* a
  thread.

- track each internal thread or *pthread* as a system process.

``mongod``
~~~~~~~~~~

- 1 file descriptor for each data file in use by the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

- 1 file descriptor for each journal file used by the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance when :setting:`storage.journal.enabled` is ``true``.

- In replica sets, each :binary:`~bin.mongod` maintains a connection to
  all other members of the set.

:binary:`~bin.mongod` uses background threads for a number of internal
processes, including :ref:`TTL collections <ttl-collections>`,
replication, and replica set health checks, which may require a small
number of additional resources.

.. _mongos-connection-use information:

``mongos``
~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the threads and file descriptors for client connections,
:binary:`~bin.mongos` must maintain connections to all config servers and
all shards, which includes all members of all replica sets.

For :binary:`~bin.mongos`, consider the following behaviors:

- :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances maintain a connection pool to each shard
  so that the :binary:`~bin.mongos` can reuse connections and quickly
  fulfill requests without needing to create new connections.

- You can limit the number of incoming connections using
  the :setting:`net.maxIncomingConnections` run-time option.
  By restricting the number of incoming connections you can prevent a
  cascade effect where the :binary:`~bin.mongos` creates too many
  connections on the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances.

Review and Set Resource Limits
------------------------------

.. _ulimit-settings:

``ulimit``
~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``ulimit`` command at the system prompt to check
system limits, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ulimit -a
   -t: cpu time (seconds)         unlimited
   -f: file size (blocks)         unlimited
   -d: data seg size (kbytes)     unlimited
   -s: stack size (kbytes)        8192
   -c: core file size (blocks)    0
   -m: resident set size (kbytes) unlimited
   -u: processes                  192276
   -n: file descriptors           21000
   -l: locked-in-memory size (kb) unlimited
   -v: address space (kb)         unlimited
   -x: file locks                 unlimited
   -i: pending signals            192276
   -q: bytes in POSIX msg queues  819200
   -e: max nice                   30
   -r: max rt priority            65
   -N 15:                         unlimited

``ulimit`` refers to the per-*user* limitations for various
resources. Therefore, if your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance executes as a
user that is also running multiple processes, or multiple
:binary:`~bin.mongod` processes, you might see contention for these
resources. Also, be aware that the ``processes`` value (i.e. ``-u``)
refers to the combined number of distinct processes and sub-process
threads.

On Linux, you can change ``ulimit`` settings by issuing a command in the
following form:

.. code-block:: bash

   ulimit -n <value>

There are both "hard" and the "soft" ``ulimit``\ s that affect MongoDB's
performance. The "hard" ``ulimit`` refers to the maximum number of
processes that a user can have active at any time. This is the
ceiling: no non-root process can increase the "hard" ``ulimit``. In
contrast, the "soft" ``ulimit`` is the limit that is actually
enforced for a session or process, but any process can increase it
up to "hard" ``ulimit`` maximum.

A low "soft" ``ulimit`` can cause ``can't create new thread,
closing connection`` errors if the number of connections
grows too high. For this reason, it is extremely important to set
*both* ``ulimit`` values to the recommended values.

``ulimit`` will modify both "hard" and "soft" values unless the
``-H`` or ``-S`` modifiers are specified when
modifying limit values.

For many distributions of Linux you can change values by substituting
the ``-n`` option for any possible value in the output of ``ulimit
-a``.

After changing the ``ulimit`` settings, you *must* restart the
process to take advantage of the modified settings. On Linux, you can
use the ``/proc`` file system to see the current limitations on a
running process.

Depending on your system's configuration, and default settings, any
change to system limits made using ``ulimit`` may revert following
a system restart. Check your distribution and operating
system documentation for more information.

You should typically start :binary:`~bin.mongod` using ``systemctl``,
which uses the ``ulimit`` settings:

.. code-block:: bash

   systemctl start mongod.service

If you *do not* start :binary:`~bin.mongod` using ``systemctl``,
``systemd`` overrides some of the ``ulimit`` settings. For example, if
you start :binary:`~bin.mongod` as shown in the following command, then
a user slice (such as ``user-1000.slice``) ``systemd`` setting is used:

.. code-block:: bash

   mongod --config ~/mongod.conf

.. note::

   A ``systemd`` user slice limits the resources for the user's
   processes.

macOS
`````

For macOS systems that have installed MongoDB Community using the 
:ref:`brew installation method<install-with-homebrew>`, the
recommended open files value is automatically set when you start
MongoDB through ``brew services``. See
:ref:`Run MongoDB with brew<run-with-homebrew>` for more information.

For macOS systems running MongoDb Enterprise or using the TGZ
installation method, use the ``launchctl limit`` command to set the
:ref:`recommended values<recommended-ulimit-settings>`. See your
operating system documentation for the precise procedure for changing
system limits on running systems.

Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server and CentOS
``````````````````````````````````````````

Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS 6 and 7 enforce a separate max process
limitation, ``nproc``, which overrides ``ulimit`` settings. This value is
defined in the following configuration file, depending on version:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 8 60

   * - Version
     - Value
     - File

   * - RHEL / CentOS 7
     - 4096
     - ``/etc/security/limits.d/20-nproc.conf``

   * - RHEL / CentOS 6
     - 1024
     - ``/etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf``

To configure an ``nproc`` value for these versions, create a file named
``/etc/security/limits.d/99-mongodb-nproc.conf`` with new ``soft nproc`` and
``hard nproc`` values to increase the process limit. For recommended values,
see :ref:`recommended-ulimit-settings`.

With RHEL / CentOS 8, separate ``nproc`` values are no longer necessary.
The ``ulimit`` command is sufficient to configure the required max
process values on RHEL / CentOS 8.

.. _recommended-ulimit-settings:

Recommended ``ulimit`` Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every deployment may have unique requirements and settings; however,
the following thresholds and settings are particularly important for
:binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` deployments:

- ``-f`` (file size): ``unlimited``
- ``-t`` (cpu time): ``unlimited``
- ``-v`` (virtual memory): ``unlimited`` [#memory-size]_
- ``-l`` (locked-in-memory size): ``unlimited``
- ``-n`` (open files): ``64000``
- ``-m`` (memory size): ``unlimited`` [#memory-size]_ [#rss-linux]_
- ``-u`` (processes/threads): ``64000``

Always remember to restart your :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances after changing the ``ulimit`` settings to
ensure that the changes take effect.

Considerations
``````````````

.. |ulimit| replace:: ``ulimit``

- .. include:: /includes/4.2-changes/open-file-connection-increase.rst

- For the macOS platform, the recommended process limit is ``2500``,
  which is the maximum configurable value for this platform.

Linux distributions using Upstart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Linux distributions that use Upstart, you can specify limits
within service scripts if you start :binary:`~bin.mongod` and/or
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instances as Upstart services. You can do this by
using ``limit`` `stanzas <http://upstart.ubuntu.com/wiki/Stanzas#limit>`_.

Specify the :ref:`recommended-ulimit-settings`, as in the following
example:

.. code-block:: bash

   limit fsize unlimited unlimited    # (file size)
   limit cpu unlimited unlimited      # (cpu time)
   limit as unlimited unlimited       # (virtual memory size)
   limit memlock unlimited unlimited  # (locked-in-memory size)
   limit nofile 64000 64000           # (open files)
   limit nproc 64000 64000            # (processes/threads)

Each ``limit`` stanza sets the "soft" limit to the first value specified and the "hard"
limit to the second.

After changing ``limit`` stanzas, ensure that the changes take
effect by restarting the application services, using the following
form:

.. code-block:: bash

   restart <service name>

Linux distributions using ``systemd``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you start a :binary:`~bin.mongod` and/or :binary:`~bin.mongos` 
instance as a ``systemd`` service, you can specify limits within the 
``[Service]`` section of its service file. The service file has a 
location like ``/etc/systemd/system/<process-name>.service``.

You can set limits by using `resource limit directives
<http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#LimitCPU=>`_.

Specify the :ref:`recommended-ulimit-settings`, as in the following
example:

.. code-block:: bash

   [Service]
   # Other directives omitted
   # (file size)
   LimitFSIZE=infinity
   # (cpu time)
   LimitCPU=infinity
   # (virtual memory size)
   LimitAS=infinity
   # (locked-in-memory size)
   LimitMEMLOCK=infinity
   # (open files)
   LimitNOFILE=64000
   # (processes/threads)
   LimitNPROC=64000

Each ``systemd`` limit directive sets both the "hard" and "soft" limits to the value
specified.

After changing ``limit`` stanzas, ensure that the changes take
effect by restarting the application services, using the following
form:

.. code-block:: bash

   systemctl restart <service name>

.. note::

   If you installed MongoDB via a package manager such as ``yum`` or
   ``apt``, the service file installed as part of your installation
   already contains these ulimit values.

.. _proc-file-system:

``/proc`` File System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   This section applies only to Linux operating systems.

The ``/proc`` file-system stores the per-process limits in the
file system object located at ``/proc/<pid>/limits``, where ``<pid>``
is the process's :term:`PID` or process identifier. You can use the
following ``bash`` function to return the content of the ``limits``
object for a process or processes with a given name:

.. code-block:: bash

   return-limits(){

        for process in $@; do
             process_pids=`ps -C $process -o pid --no-headers | cut -d " " -f 2`

             if [ -z $@ ]; then
                echo "[no $process running]"
             else
                for pid in $process_pids; do
                      echo "[$process #$pid -- limits]"
                      cat /proc/$pid/limits
                done
             fi

        done

   }

You can copy and paste this function into a current shell session or
load it as part of a script. Call the function with one the following
invocations:

.. code-block:: bash

   return-limits mongod
   return-limits mongos
   return-limits mongod mongos

.. [#memory-size] If you limit virtual or resident memory size on a
   system running MongoDB the operating system will refuse to honor
   additional allocation requests.

.. [#rss-linux] The ``-m`` parameter to ``ulimit`` has no effect on
   Linux systems with kernel versions more recent than 2.4.30. You may
   omit ``-m`` if you wish.
