"MongoDB provides the three approaches to aggregation, each with its own "
"strengths and purposes for a given situation. This section describes these "
"approaches and also describes behaviors and limitations specific to each "
"approach. See also the :doc:`chart </reference/aggregation-commands-"

"The aggregation pipeline is a framework for performing aggregation tasks, "
"modeled on the concept of data processing pipelines. Using this framework, "
"MongoDB passes the documents of a single collection through a pipeline. The "
"pipeline transforms the documents into aggregated results, and is accessed "
"through the :dbcommand:`aggregate` database command."
