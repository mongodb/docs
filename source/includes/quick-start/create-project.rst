This guide shows you how add the MongoDB Java driver dependencies using
Maven or Gradle. We recommend that you use an integrated development
environment (IDE) such as Intellij IDEA, Eclipse IDE, or NetBeans Java IDE to
make it more convenient to configure Maven or Gradle to build and run your
project.

If you are not using an IDE, see
`Building Maven <https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-building-maven.html>`_
or
`Creating New Gradle Builds <https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/>`_
for more information on how to set up your project.
