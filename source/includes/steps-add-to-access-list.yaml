  .. important:: Ensure that you add the IP address you will use to
     access MongoDB as the ``admin`` user.

  Enter the desired IP address or |cidr|\-notated range of addresses:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 40 60

     * - Entry

       - Grants

     * - An IP address

       - Access from that address.

     * - A |cidr|\-notated range of IP addresses

       - Access from the designated range of addresses.

         For peer |vpc| connections, you can specify the |cidr| block
         (or a subset) or the associated Security Group.

         The Internet provides online tools for converting a range of
         IP addresses to |cidr|, such as
         `<http://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr>`_.

         .. important::

            Adding the |cidr| ``0.0.0.0/0`` allows access from anywhere.
            Ensure that strong credentials (username and password) are
            used for all database users when allowing access from
            anywhere.

     * - Security Group ID (AWS Only)

       - Access via Security Group membership from a peered VPC.

         .. important::

            |service| does not support adding |aws| security groups to
            IP access lists in projects with |vpc| peering connections
            in multiple regions.

title: "(Optional) Set the IP access list as temporary."
level: 4
ref: set-temporary-ip
content: |

  Check the :guilabel:`Save as temporary access list` option to specify
  a length of time that the IP address will be added. After this time,
  |service| removes the address from the IP access list. You can select
  one of the following time periods for the address to be added:

  - 6 hours

  - 1 day

  - 1 week

  In the :guilabel:`IP Access List` view, temporary access list entries
  display the time remaining until the address will expire. Once the IP
  address expires and is deleted, any client or application attempting
  to connect to the cluster from the address can't access the cluster.

  .. note::

     You cannot set |aws| security groups as temporary access list
     entries.
