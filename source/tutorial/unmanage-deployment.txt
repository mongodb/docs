Remove a Process from Management or Monitoring
==============================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can remove a process from management, monitoring, or both.
Removing a process does **not** shut down the process.
You can remove individual processes or
an entire :term:`cluster <sharded cluster>` or :term:`replica set`.

Managed Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removing a process from management (i.e., Automation) means you can no
longer control it directly through |mms|. If you are removing a managed
process and want to be able to easily stop and start the
process after removal, you can :doc:`create scripts for stopping and
starting the process </tutorial/stop-using-automation>`.

If you do **not** want to leave a managed process running after removal,
:doc:`shut down the process </tutorial/shut-down-deployment>` before
removing it.

As an alternative to removing a process from automated management, you can
temporarily :doc:`suspend </tutorial/suspend-automation>` management of the process.
This is useful if you need to temporarily shut down the process, for example
for maintenance, and do not want |mms| to automatically start the
process back up until you are ready.

Monitored Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removing a process from monitoring means |mms| no longer displays
its status or tracks its metrics. 

As an alternative to removing a process from monitoring, you can instead
disable its alerts, which allows you to continue to view the process in
the :guilabel:`Deployment` page but turns off notifications about its
status. To use this option, see :doc:`/tutorial/manage-host-alerts`.
