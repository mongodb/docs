Overview
--------

This tutorial describes how to :ref:`install <install-on-prem-with-rpm>`
or :ref:`upgrade <upgrade-on-prem-with-rpm>` the
:ref:`mms-application-package` and the optional :ref:`MMS Backup Daemon
<backup-daemon>` using ``rpm`` packages. The |application| monitors
MongoDB deployments, and the Backup Daemon creates and stores deployment
snapshots.

Next Steps
----------

To set up a replica set for a test environment, see
:doc:`/tutorial/test-new-deployment`. The tutorial populates the replica set
with test data, registers a user, and installs the Monitoring and Backup
Agents on a client machine in order to monitor the test replica set.

To download the Monitoring and Backup Agents to a client machine, see
:doc:`/user-guide`.

Upgrade Procedures
------------------

Upgrade |mms| from 1.3 and Later
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you have an existing |onprem| deployment, use the following
procedure to upgrade to the latest release. There are no supported
downgrade paths for |onprem|.

.. include:: /includes/steps/upgrade-on-prem-with-rpm-packages.rst

Upgrade |mms| from 1.2 and Earlier
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Due to the `company name change
<http://www.mongodb.com/press/10gen-announces-company-name-change-mongodb-inc>`_,
the name of the |mms| package changed between versions 1.2 and 1.3.
Therefore, to upgrade the |mms| server from *any* version before 1.3, use
the following procedure:

#. *Recommended.* Take a full backup of the |mms| database before
   beginning the upgrade procedure.

#. Shut down |mms|, using the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      /etc/init.d/10gen-mms stop

#. Download the latest package from
   `the downloads page <http://www.mongodb.com/subscription/downloads/mms>`_
   and proceed with the instructions
   for a fresh install. Do not attempt to use your package manager
   to do an upgrade.

   When complete, |mms| is installed in the ``/opt/mongodb/mms``
   directory.

#. Follow all procedures for a new install, including configuring the
   options in ``/opt/mongodb/mms/conf/conf-mms.properties``. If you
   used encrypted authentication credentials you will need to
   regenerate these manually.  *Do not copy the credentials from
   your old properties file. Old credentials will not work.*

#. Start |mms| using the new package name:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo /etc/init.d/mongodb-mms start

#. Update any Monitoring Agent. See :doc:`/tutorial/nav/install-monitoring-agent` for
   more information.
