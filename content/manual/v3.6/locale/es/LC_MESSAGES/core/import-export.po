"This document provides an overview of the import and export programs "
"included in the MongoDB distribution. These tools are useful when you want "
"to backup or export a portion of your data without capturing the state of "
"the entire database, or for simple data ingestion cases. For more complex "
"data migration tasks, you may want to write your own import and export "
"scripts using a client :term:`driver` to interact with the database itself. "
"For disaster recovery protection and routine database backup operation, use "
"full :doc:`database instance backups </core/backups>`."
