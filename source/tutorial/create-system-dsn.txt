The following steps describe how to create a system Data Source
Name (DSN) for the :program:`mongosqld` process. A DSN is a
saved configuration which describes a database
connection to be used by an ODBC driver. Once defined and registered,
a DSN can be used to connect to the BI Connector from several MySQL
clients.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before creating a :abbr:`DSN (Data Source Name)`, you should:

- Download and install the :doc:`C Authentication Plugin
  </tutorial/install-auth-plugin-c>` for your
  platform from the `releases page
  <https://github.com/mongodb/mongosql-auth-c/releases>`_.

- Download and install the MySQL Connector/ODBC driver for your
  platform. If you plan to use |bi-short| with SSL enabled, you should
  use the MySQL `Enterprise Edition installer
  <https://www.mysql.com/downloads/>`_. Otherwise you can use the
  `Community Edtion <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/>`_.
