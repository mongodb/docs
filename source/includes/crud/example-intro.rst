.. note:: Example Setup

    This example connects to an instance of MongoDB by using a connection URI. To learn
    more about connecting to your MongoDB instance, see the :ref:`connection guide
    <connect-to-mongodb>`. This example also uses the ``movies`` collection in the
    ``sample_mflix`` database included in the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets
    </sample-data?jmp=docs_driver_java>`. You can load them into
    your database on the free tier of MongoDB Atlas by following the :atlas:`Get
    Started with Atlas Guide
    </getting-started/#atlas-getting-started?jmp=docs_driver_java>`.
