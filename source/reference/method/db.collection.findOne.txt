db.collection.findOne()
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Definition
----------

.. method:: db.collection.findOne(query,projection)

   Returns one document that satisfies the specified query. If
   multiple documents satisfy the query, this method returns the first
   document according to the :term:`natural order` which reflects the
   order of documents on the disk. In :term:`capped collections
   <capped collection>`, natural order is the same as insertion order.

   .. include:: /reference/method/db.collection.findOne-param.rst

   :returns:

      One document that satisfies the query specified as the argument
      to this method. If you specify the ``projection`` argument,
      :method:`~db.collection.findOne()` returns a document that only
      contains the ``projection`` fields, and the ``_id`` field if you
      do not explicitly exclude the ``_id`` field.

Example
-------

The following is a prototype document for the ``projection`` argument:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { field1: boolean, field2: boolean ... }

The ``boolean`` can take the following include or exclude values:

- ``1`` or ``true`` to include. The :method:`~db.collection.findOne()`
  method always includes the :term:`_id` field even if the field is not
  explicitly stated to return in the :term:`projection` parameter.

- ``0`` or ``false`` to exclude.

The ``projection`` cannot contain both include and exclude
specifications except for the exclusion of the ``_id`` field.
