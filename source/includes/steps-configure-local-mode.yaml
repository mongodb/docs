stepnum: 4
ref: populate-with-binaries

  Populate the directory you specified in the ``automation.versions.directory``
  setting with the necessary versions of MongoDB as determined by the
  :ref:`local-mode-determine-versions` topic on this page.

  .. important::

     If you have not yet read the :ref:`local-mode-determine-versions` topic
     on this page, please do so before continuing with this procedure.

  For example, to download MongoDB Enterprise 3.0 on Amazon Linux, issue a
  command similar to the following, replacing ``<download-url.tgz>`` with
  the download url for the archive:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo curl -OL <download-url.tgz>

    ``/opt/mongodb/mms/mongodb-releases/`` directory, you could use the
    following sequence of commands to change ownership for **all** files
    in that directory to "mongodb-mms":
