.. admonition:: Aggregation Pipeline as Alternative to Map-Reduce
   :class: note

   An :doc:`aggregation pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>` provides
   better performance and usability than a :doc:`map-reduce
   </core/map-reduce>` operation.

   Map-reduce operations can be rewritten using :doc:`aggregation
   pipeline operators </meta/aggregation-quick-reference>`, such as
   :pipeline:`$group`, :pipeline:`$merge`, and others. 

   For map-reduce operations that require custom functionality, MongoDB
   provides the :group:`$accumulator` and :expression:`$function`
   aggregation operators starting in version 4.4. Use these operators to
   define custom aggregation expressions in JavaScript.

In the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, the :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()`
method is a wrapper around the :dbcommand:`mapReduce` command. The
following examples use the :method:`db.collection.mapReduce()` method.
