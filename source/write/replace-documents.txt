Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the {+driver-short+} to replace
a document in a MongoDB collection by performing a **replace operation**.

A replace operation replaces one document in a MongoDB collection with new
fields and values that you specify. You can perform a replace operation by using
the ``replaceOne()`` method.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``sample_restaurants.restaurants`` collection
from the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets </sample-data>`. 

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample
datasets, see the :ref:`<java-rs-getting-started>` tutorial.

Replace Operation
-----------------

You can perform a replace operation by using the ``replaceOne()``
method on a ``MongoCollection`` instance. This method removes all fields except the ``_id`` field from the first
document that matches the search criteria, then adds the fields and values
you specify to the empty document.

Required Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``replaceOne()`` method requires the following parameters:

- **Query filter** document, which determines which documents to
  replace. For more information about query filters, see the
  :ref:`<java-rs-specify-query>` guide.

- **Replace** document, which specifies the fields and values to insert in the new 
  document.

Replace Example
---------------

To replace a single document in a MongoDB collection, call the ``replaceOne()`` method
and pass the query filter document and the replace document as parameters. Then, 
pass the ``replaceOne()`` result to the static ``Mono.from()`` method from
``Mono``. ``Mono`` is a class from the {+pr+} library. In {+java-rs+}, 
the driver methods return cold ``Publisher`` instances, which means that the
corresponding operation does not happen unless you subscribe to the returned
``Publisher``. This guide uses the {+pr+} library to consume them. To learn more
about ``Mono``, see `Mono <https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#mono>`__ in the
{+pr+} documentation.

The following example uses the ``replaceOne()`` method to replace the fields and values of a
document with a ``name`` field value of ``"Pizza Town"``. The ``replaceOne()``
method replaces the original document with a document that has a ``name`` field
value of ``"Mongo's Pizza"`` and a ``cuisine`` field value of ``"Pizza"``.

.. code-block:: java
   :copyable: true

    Publisher<UpdateResult> replacePublisher = restaurants.replaceOne(
            eq("name", "Pizza Town"),
            new Document().append("name", "Mongo's Pizza")
                    .append("cuisine", "Pizza"));
    Mono.from(replacePublisher).block();

Modify Replace Behavior
-----------------------

You can optionally modify the behavior of the ``replaceOne()`` method by calling
an options method. The ``ReplaceOptions`` class provides methods that modify
the behavior of the ``replaceOne()`` method. To use the ``ReplaceOptions``
class, construct a new instance of the class, then call one or more of its methods
to modify the replace operation. You can chain these method calls together.
To modify the behavior of the replace operation, pass the class instance and
chained method calls as the last argument to the
``replaceOne()`` method.

You can use the following methods in the ``ReplaceOptions`` class
to modify the ``replaceOne()`` method.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``bypassDocumentValidation(Boolean bypass)``
     - | Specifies whether the replace operation bypasses document validation. This lets you 
         update documents that don't meet the schema validation requirements, if any 
         exist. For more information about schema validation, see :manual:`Schema
         Validation </core/schema-validation/#schema-validation>` in the MongoDB
         Server manual.
      
   * - ``collation(Collation collation)``
     - | Specifies the kind of language collation to use when sorting
         results. For more information, see :manual:`Collation </reference/collation/#std-label-collation>`
         in the MongoDB Server manual.  

   * - ``comment(BsonValue comment)``
     - | Attaches a ``BsonValue`` comment to the operation. For more information, see the :manual:`insert command
         fields </reference/command/insert/#command-fields>` guide in the
         MongoDB Server manual.  

   * - ``comment(String comment)``
     - | Attaches a ``String`` comment to the operation. For more information, see the :manual:`insert command
         fields </reference/command/insert/#command-fields>` guide in the
         MongoDB Server manual.  

   * - ``hint(Bson hint)``
     - | Sets the index for the operation as a ``Bson`` value. 
         For more information, see the :manual:`hint statement </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-command-hint>`
         in the MongoDB Server manual.

   * - ``hintString(String hint)``
     - | Sets the index for the operation as a ``String`` value.
         For more information, see the :manual:`hint statement </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-command-hint>`
         in the MongoDB Server manual.

   * - ``let(Bson variables)``
     - | Specifies a map of parameter names and values. Values must be constant or closed
         expressions that don't reference document fields. For more information,
         see the :manual:`let statement
         </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-let-syntax>` in the
         MongoDB Server manual.

   * - ``sort(Bson sort)``
     - | Sets the sort criteria to apply to the operation. If multiple
         documents match the query filter that you pass to the
         ``replaceOne()`` method, the operation replaces the first
         result. You can set this option to apply an order to matched
         documents to have more control over which document is replaced.

   * - ``upsert(Boolean upsert)``
     - | Specifies whether the replace operation performs an upsert operation if no 
         documents match the query filter. For more information, see the :manual:`upsert
         statement </reference/command/update/#std-label-update-command-upsert>`
         in the MongoDB Server manual.

Modify Replace Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following code uses the ``replaceOne()`` method to replace a document in the
``restaurants`` collection. It also sets the ``upsert(true)`` option
so that the driver inserts a new document if the query filter doesn't 
match any existing documents.

.. code-block:: java

    Publisher<UpdateResult> replacePublisher = restaurants.replaceOne(
            eq("name", "Food Town"),
            new Document().append("name", "Food World")
                    .append("cuisine", "Mixed"),
            new ReplaceOptions().upsert(true));
    Mono.from(replacePublisher).block();

Return Value
------------

The ``replaceOne()`` method returns an ``UpdateResult`` 
object. Use the following methods from the ``UpdateResult`` type to access
the corresponding information:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``getMatchedCount()``
     - | The number of documents that matched the query filter, regardless of
         how many were replaced.

   * - ``getModifiedCount()``
     - | The number of documents modified by the replace operation. If a replaced
         document is identical to the original, it is not included in this
         count.

   * - ``getUpsertedId()``
     - | The ID of the document that was inserted into the database, if the driver
         performed an upsert. If no document was inserted, this value is ``null``.
         
   * - ``wasAcknowledged()``
     - | An acknowledgement of the replacement.
