Overview
--------

When used with the ``--logpath`` option or :setting:`systemLog.path`
setting, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances
report a live account of all activity and operations to a log file. 
When reporting activity data to a log file, by default, MongoDB only
rotates logs in response to the :dbcommand:`logRotate` command, or when
the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` process receives a
``SIGUSR1`` signal from the operating system.

MongoDB's standard log rotation approach archives the current
log file and starts a new one. To do this, the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
:binary:`~bin.mongos` instance renames the current log file by appending
a UTC timestamp to the filename, in :term:`ISODate` format. It then
opens a new log file, closes the old log file, and sends all new log
entries to the new log file.

You can also configure MongoDB to support the Linux/Unix ``logrotate``
utility by setting :setting:`systemLog.logRotate` or
``--logRotate`` to ``reopen``. With ``reopen``, :binary:`~bin.mongod`
or :binary:`~bin.mongos` closes the log file, and
then reopens a log file with the same name, expecting that another
process renamed the file prior to rotation.

Finally, you can configure :binary:`~bin.mongod` to send log data to the
``syslog`` using the :option:`--syslog <mongod --syslog>` option. In
this case, you can take advantage of alternate log rotation tools.

Default Log Rotation Behavior
-----------------------------

By default, MongoDB uses the
``--logRotate rename`` behavior. 
With ``rename``, :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
:binary:`~bin.mongos` renames the current log file by appending a UTC 
timestamp to the filename, opens a new log file, closes the old log
file, and sends all new log entries to the new log file.

Log Rotation with ``--logRotate reopen``
----------------------------------------

Log rotation with ``--logRotate reopen`` closes and opens
the log file following the typical Linux/Unix log rotate behavior.

Syslog Log Rotation
-------------------

With syslog log rotation, :binary:`~bin.mongod` sends log data to the
syslog rather than writing it to a file.

Starting in version 4.2, MongoDB includes the :ref:`component
<log-message-components>` in its log messages to ``syslog``.

.. include:: /includes/steps/log-rotate-syslog.rst

Forcing a Log Rotation with ``SIGUSR1``
---------------------------------------

For Linux and Unix-based systems, you can use the ``SIGUSR1`` signal
to rotate the logs for a single process.

For example, if a running :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance has a
process ID (PID) of ``2200``, the following command rotates the log
file for that instance on Linux:

.. code-block:: sh

   kill -SIGUSR1 2200

Interaction with Audit Logs
---------------------------

If :doc:`auditing </core/auditing>` is enabled, the
:dbcommand:`logRotate` command also rotates the audit log.
