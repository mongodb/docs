.. warning::

   Do not make :program:`mongod.exe` visible on public networks without

   enable "Secure Mode" by default.

Configure a Windows Service for MongoDB Enterprise
--------------------------------------------------

.. note::
   There is a known issue for MongoDB 2.6.0, :issue:`SERVER-13515`,
   which prevents the use of the instructions in this section. For
   MongoDB 2.6.0, use :ref:`manually-create-windows-service-enterprise`

You can set up the MongoDB server as a :guilabel:`Windows Service` that
starts automatically at boot time.
