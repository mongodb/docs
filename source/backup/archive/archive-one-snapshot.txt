Manual Restore One Snapshot

|service| provides a mechanism for downloading cloud provider,
{+old-backup+}, and M2/M5 snapshots as compressed files.

The downloaded files consist of the raw files copied from the data 
directory. ``mongorestore`` is incompatible with these files. To access 
the data files, use the following procedure to start a 
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instance and point it to the extract directory.

   .. tab:: {+Cloud-Backup+}s

      Considerations
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      When manually downloading a cloud backup snapshot, there is the possibility
      that your download may be interrupted for some reason. |service| keeps
      the request alive and allows it to be restarted as long as the most recent
      download failure is no more than one hour old.

   .. tab:: {+Old-Backup+}
      :tabid: cb-dl

      To learn more about this backup type, see
      :ref:`legacy-backup`.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/manual-restore-cb.rst

   .. tab:: M2/M5 Cluster
      :tabid: m2-m5-dl

      You can download a snapshot for any M2/M5 cluster in a project
      for which you have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role.
