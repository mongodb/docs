|service-fullname| is a cloud service for running, monitoring, and
maintaining MongoDB deployments, including the provisioning of
dedicated servers for the MongoDB instances.

MongoDB Deployments
-------------------

MongoDB deployments, or "clusters" in |service|, can be either a
:term:`replica set` or a :term:`sharded cluster`. 

.. include:: /includes/fact-mongodb-version.rst

|service| deploys each cluster across a mininmum of three availability
zones and with mandatory security.

.. include:: /includes/fact-single-tenant.rst

Security
--------

|service| secures your deployments through the use of TLS/SSL, virtual
private cloud (VPC) subnet with IP whitelisting IP whitelists, and user
authentication using :ref:`SCRAM-SHA1 <authentication-scram-sha-1>` and
:ref:`authorization <authorization>`.

Support
-------

|service| provides support for the use of the service itself. Support
for development and performance of the database itself requires a
MongoDB subscription. For details, `contact MongoDB Inc.
<https://www.mongodb.com/contact?jmp=docs>`_.

Next Steps
----------

To get started, see :doc:`getting-started`.

.. Do we need to list key features, or is that marketing content?
