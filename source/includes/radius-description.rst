The radius customization option dictates the size of the data markers
in :ref:`Geospatial Heatmaps <geospatial-heatmap-type>`. The color of
each data marker reflects the aggregated value of all data points
within that marker's radius. Radius is measured in pixels, and defaults
to ``30``.

.. example::

   If ten data points exist within the specified radius, the color
   displayed is based on the aggregated value of those ten data points.
