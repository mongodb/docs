.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. contents:: On this page
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: twocols

.. include:: /includes/styles/corrections.rst

This page describes the conditions for which you can trigger alerts
related to your clusters. You specify conditions and thresholds when
:doc:`configuring alerts </configure-alerts>`.

.. include:: /includes/fact-free-shared-alerts.rst

Host Alerts
-----------

The conditions in this section apply if you select :guilabel:`Host` as
the alert target when configuring the alert. You can apply the
condition to all hosts or to specific type of host, such as
:term:`primaries <primary>` or
:term:`config servers <config server>`.

Advisor
~~~~~~~

.. alert:: Host has index suggestions

   Sends an alert if :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>`
   has index suggestions for the host.

   If the :ref:`query targeting ratio <query-targeting-resolution>` for
   a host consistently exceeds 10,000 for a period of 10 minutes,
   Performance Advisor checks the host for inefficient queries and
   possible indexes to improve performance. If Performance Advisor
   determines that the host would benefit from one or more indexes,
   this alert triggers and directs you to create the suggested indexes.

   This alert is only available for ``M10+`` clusters, and is enabled
   by default for ``M10+`` clusters that have
   :ref:`Performance Advisor <performance-advisor>` enabled. This alert
   does not trigger for clusters where Performance Advisor is disabled.

Asserts
~~~~~~~

The following alert conditions measure the rate of asserts for a MongoDB
process, as collected from the MongoDB ``serverStatus`` command's

System and Disk Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following alert conditions measure usage on your |service| server
clusters:

.. alert:: System: CPU (Steal) % is

   *Applicable when the EC2 cluster credit balance is exhausted.*

   The percentage by which the CPU usage exceeds the guaranteed
   baseline CPU credit accumulation rate. CPU credits are units of CPU
   utilization that you accumulate. The credits accumulate at a
   constant rate to provide a guaranteed level of performance. These
   credits can be used for additional CPU performance. When the credit
   balance is exhausted, only the guaranteed baseline of CPU
   performance is provided, and the amount of excess is shown as steal
   percent.

   .. note::

      |service| triggers this alert only for AWS EC2 clusters that
      support :aws:`Burstable Performance </AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html>`.
      Currently, these are ``M10`` and ``M20`` cluster types.

   by the ``eth0`` network interface reaches the specified threshold.

.. alert:: System: Network bytes out is

   MongoDB collection data.

   To find possible solutions for this alert, see
   :doc:`Alert Resolutions </reference/alert-resolutions/disk-space-used>`.

.. alert:: Disk space % used on Index Partition is

   The percentage of disk space used on any partition that contains the
   MongoDB index data.

   To find possible solutions for this alert, see
   :doc:`Alert Resolutions </reference/alert-resolutions/disk-space-used>`.

.. alert:: Disk space % used on Journal Partition is

   The percentage of disk space used on the partition that contains the
   MongoDB journal, if journaling is enabled.

   To find possible solutions for this alert, see
   :doc:`Alert Resolutions </reference/alert-resolutions/disk-space-used>`.

.. alert:: Disk I/O % utilization on Data Partition is

   The percentage of time during which requests are being issued to any
   partition that contains the MongoDB collection data. This includes
   requests from any process, not just MongoDB processes.

   The percentage of time during which requests are being issued to any
   partition that contains the MongoDB index data. This includes
   requests from any process, not just MongoDB processes.

.. alert:: Disk I/O % utilization on Journal Partition is

   The percentage of time during which requests are being issued to the
   partition that contains the MongoDB journal, if journaling is
   enabled. This includes requests from any process, not just MongoDB
   processes.

.. alert:: Restarts in Last Hour is

   Sends an alert if the number of times a host restarts within the
   previous hour exceeds the specified threshold.

Host Down
~~~~~~~~~

.. alert:: Host is Down

   Sends an alert if |service| is unable to reach a host for several
   minutes.

   .. important::

      You should only configure this alert if you depend on secondary
      reads. For more information on secondary reads, see
      :ref:`replica-set-tags` and :ref:`replica-set-read-preference`.

   This alert is generally triggered by one of the following
   conditions:

   - The cluster has experienced a failure and is being auto-healed.
   - The cluster could not be reached because of a network issue.

   |service-fullname| will replace the affected node. |service|
   clusters maintain both read and write availability in the face of
   node failures as long as a majority of nodes remain healty. For more
   information on how |service| delivers high availability, see the
   :ref:`FAQ <high-availability>`.

~~~~

.. alert:: Swap: used is

   Sends an alert if the total amount swap space in use reaches the specified

Replica Set Alerts
------------------

The following alert conditions apply to
:term:`replica sets <replica set>`:

.. alert:: Replica set has no primary

   Sends an alert when a replica set does not have a :term:`primary`.
   Specifically, when none of the members of a replica set have a
   status of ``PRIMARY``, the alert triggers. For example, this
   condition may arise when a set has an even number of voting members
   resulting in a tie.

   If |service| collects data during an :manual:`election for primary
   </core/replica-set-elections>`, this alert might send a false
   positive. To prevent such false positives, set the alert
   configuration's :guilabel:`after waiting` interval (in the
   configuration's :guilabel:`Send to` section).

   To find possible solutions for this alert, see
   :doc:`Alert Resolutions </reference/alert-resolutions/no-primary>`.

.. alert:: Replica set elected a new primary

.. alert:: Number of elections in last hour is > X

   Sends an alert when the number of elections that have occurred in
   the last hour exceeds the user-specified value of ``X``. The value
   of ``X`` is set when you create the alert. This alert may indicate
   that the cluster's replication is not in a healthy state, as
   evidenced by constant elections.

Sharded Cluster Alerts
