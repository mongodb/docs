  If your |mms| deployment uses |tls|, then you must configure the
  {+mdbagent+} to use |tls|. To configure the agent to use |tls|,
  you must have a trusted |certauth| certificate that signed the
  MongoDB instance's certificate.

  In the agent's install directory, edit the configuration file to set
  :asetting:`httpsCAFile` field to the path of a file containing one or
  more certificates in |pem| format.

  .. include:: /includes/list-table-automation-agent-conf-file-locations.rst

  .. example::

     If you would use the following command to connect through {+mongosh+}:

     .. code-block:: sh

        mongosh --tls --tlsCAFile /etc/ssl/ca.pem example.net:27017

  Then you would modify the configuration file, setting this key/value
  pair:

  .. code-block:: ini

     httpsCAFile=/etc/ssl/ca.pem

  To learn more about these settings, see
  :ref:`automation-server-ssl-settings`.
