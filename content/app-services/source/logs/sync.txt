Overview
--------

Atlas Device Sync creates sync logs whenever a user interacts with Sync. This
includes writing data to Atlas App Services from clients, reading changes from
App Services to clients, and starting or ending a connection.

Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~

Every user communicates with App Services using a *connection*. Each
connection uses a single websocket to push and pull information to and
from a single user. Logging in a user using any authentication provider
starts a connection. Logging out that user ends the connection.

Sessions
~~~~~~~~

Users download and upload changes to a synced realm using a *session*. 
Instantiating a local instance of a synced realm starts a session. 
Destroying that realm object ends the session.

MongoDB Atlas Sync Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every sync event is associated with a user identity that tells you
exactly which user caused the event to occur. However, you may notice
some sync events that aren't associated with any specific user. These
events include downloaded changes from all clients as well as as well as 
any change made in MongoDB Atlas. Any sync event that does not include 
a user ID is part of the MongoDB Atlas data synchronization process. You 
may see a large number of MongoDB Atlas synchronization events when you 
initialize sync if your cluster already contains a large amount of data.
