======================
Upgrade MongoDB to 2.6
======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

In the general case, the upgrade from MongoDB 2.4 to 2.6 is a
binary-compatible "drop-in" upgrade: shut down the :program:`mongod`
instances and replace them with :program:`mongod` instances running
2.6. **However**, before you attempt any upgrade, familiarize yourself
with the content of this document, particularly the
:ref:`2.6-upgrade-considerations`, the procedure for :ref:`upgrading
sharded clusters <2.6-upgrade-cluster>`, and the considerations for
:ref:`reverting to 2.4 after running 2.6
<2.6-downgrade-considerations>`.

.. _2.6-upgrade-considerations:

Upgrade Recommendations and Checklists
--------------------------------------

When upgrading, consider the following:

Upgrade Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upgrade an existing MongoDB deployment to 2.6, you must be running
2.4. If you're running a version of MongoDB before 2.4, you *must*
upgrade to 2.4 before upgrading to 2.6. See
:doc:`/release-notes/2.4-upgrade` for the procedure to upgrade from
2.2 to 2.4.

If you use MMS Backup, ensure that you're running *at least* version
``v20131216.1`` of the Backup agent before upgrading.

Preparedness
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before upgrading MongoDB always test your application in a staging
environment before deploying the upgrade to your production
environment.

To begin the upgrade procedure, connect a 2.6 :program:`mongo` shell
to your MongoDB 2.4 :program:`mongos` or :program:`mongod` and run the
:method:`db.upgradeCheckAllDBs()` to check your data set for
compatibility. This is a preliminary automated check. Assess and
resolve all issues identified by :method:`db.upgradeCheckAllDBs()`.

Some changes in MongoDB 2.6 require manual checks and
intervention. See :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-compatibility` for an
explanation of these changes. Resolve all incompatibilities in your
deployment before continuing.

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB 2.6 includes significant changes to the authorization model,
which requires changes to the way that MongoDB stores users'
credentials. As a result, in addition to upgrading MongoDB processes,
if your deployment uses authentication and authorization, after
upgrading all MongoDB process to 2.6 you must also upgrade the
authorization model.

Before beginning the upgrade process for a deployment that uses
authentication and authorization:

- Ensure that at least one user exists in the ``admin`` database.

- If your application performs CRUD operations on the
  :data:`<database>.system.users` collection or uses a
  :method:`db.addUser()`\ -like method, then you **must**
  upgrade those drivers (i.e. client libraries) **before**
  :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instances.

- You must fully complete the upgrade procedure for *all* MongoDB
  processes before upgrading the authorization model.

See :ref:`2.6-upgrade-authorization-model` for a complete discussion
of the upgrade procedure for the authorization model including
additional requirements and procedures.

Downgrade Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once upgraded to MongoDB 2.6, you **cannot** downgrade to **any** version
earlier than MongoDB 2.4. If you created ``text`` or ``2dsphere``
indexes while running 2.6, you can only downgrade to MongoDB 2.4.10 or
later.

Upgrade MongoDB Processes
-------------------------

.. _2.6-upgrade-standalone:

Upgrade Standalone ``mongod`` Instance to MongoDB 2.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a standalone
:program:`mongod` from version 2.4 to 2.6. To upgrade from version
2.2 to 2.6, :doc:`upgrade to version 2.4
</release-notes/2.4-upgrade>` *first*, and then follow the procedure to
upgrade from 2.4 to 2.6.

#. Download binaries of the latest release in the 2.6 series from the
   `MongoDB Download Page`_. See :doc:`/installation` for more
   information.

#. Shut down your :program:`mongod` instance. Replace the existing
   binary with the 2.6 :program:`mongod` binary and restart :program:`mongod`.

.. _`MongoDB Download Page`: http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

.. _2.6-upgrade-replica-set:

Upgrade a Replica Set to 2.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps outline the procedure to upgrade a replica set from
MongoDB 2.4 to MongoDB 2.6. To upgrade from MongoDB 2.2 to 2.6,
:doc:`upgrade all members of the replica set to version 2.4
</release-notes/2.4-upgrade>` *first*, and then follow the procedure to
upgrade from MongoDB 2.4 to 2.6.

You can upgrade from MongoDB 2.4 to 2.6 using a "rolling" upgrade to
minimize downtime by upgrading the members individually while the other
members are available:

.. include:: /includes/steps/2.6-upgrade-replica-set.rst

Replica set failover is not instant but will render the set
unavailable accept writes until the failover process
completes. Typically this takes 30 seconds or more: schedule the
upgrade procedure during a scheduled maintenance window.

.. _2.6-upgrade-cluster:

Upgrade a Sharded Cluster to 2.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only upgrade sharded clusters to 2.6 if **all** members of the
cluster are currently running instances of 2.4. The only supported
upgrade path for sharded clusters running 2.2 is via 2.4. The upgrade
process checks all components of the cluster and will produce warnings
if any component is running version 2.2.

Considerations
``````````````

The upgrade process does not require any downtime. However, while you
upgrade the sharded cluster, ensure that clients do not make changes
to the collection meta-data. For example, during the upgrade, do **not**
do any of the following:

- :method:`sh.enableSharding()`

- :method:`sh.shardCollection()`

- :method:`sh.addShard()`

- :method:`db.createCollection()`

- :method:`db.collection.drop()`

- :method:`db.dropDatabase()`

- any operation that creates a database

- any other operation that modifies the cluster metadata in any
  way. See :doc:`/reference/sharding` for a complete list
  of sharding commands. Note, however, that not all commands on
  the :doc:`/reference/sharding` page modifies the
  cluster meta-data.

Upgrade Sharded Clusters
````````````````````````

*Optional but Recommended.* As a precaution, take a backup of the
``config`` database *before* upgrading the sharded cluster.

.. include:: /includes/steps/2.6-upgrade-sharded-cluster.rst

.. _2.6-finalize-shard-cluster-upgrade:

Complete Sharded Cluster Upgrade
````````````````````````````````

After you have successfully upgraded *all* :program:`mongos` instances,
you can upgrade the other instances in your MongoDB deployment.

.. warning::

   Do not upgrade :program:`mongod` instances until after you have
   upgraded *all* :program:`mongos` instances.

While the balancer is still disabled, upgrade the components of your
sharded cluster in the following order:

- Upgrade all 3 :program:`mongod` config server instances, leaving
  the *first* system in the :option:`mongos --configdb` argument to upgrade
  *last*.

- Upgrade each shard, one at a time, upgrading the :program:`mongod`
  secondaries before running :dbcommand:`replSetStepDown` and
  upgrading the primary of each shard.

When this process is complete, :ref:`re-enable the
balancer <sharding-balancing-enable>`.
