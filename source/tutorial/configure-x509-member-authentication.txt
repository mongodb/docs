Use x.509 Certificate for Membership Authentication

MongoDB supports x.509 certificate authentication for use with a secure
:doc:`TLS/SSL connection </tutorial/configure-ssl>`. Sharded cluster
members and replica set members can use x.509 certificates to verify
their membership to the cluster or the replica set instead of using
:ref:`keyfiles <internal-auth-keyfile>`. The membership authentication is
an internal process.

.. |binary| replace:: MongoDB

Enabling internal authentication also enables 
:doc:`/core/authorization`. Clients must authenticate as a user in order to 
connect and perform operations in the deployment.

* See the :doc:`/tutorial/manage-users-and-roles` tutorial for 
  instructions on adding users to the deployment.

* See the :doc:`/tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication` tutorial 
  for instructions on using x.509 certificates for user authentication.

Member x.509 Certificate
------------------------

.. note::

   You must have valid x.509 certificates.

Configure Replica Set/Sharded Cluster
-------------------------------------

Outside of rolling upgrade procedures, every component of a :term:`replica
set` or :term:`sharded cluster` should use the same
``--clusterAuthMode`` setting to ensure it can securely connect to all
other components in the deployment.

For :term:`replica set` deployments, this includes all :binary:`~bin.mongod` 
members of the replica set.

For :term:`sharded cluster` deployments, this includes all :binary:`~bin.mongod` 
or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

Use Command-line Options (``tls``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   The procedures in this section use the ``ssl`` settings/option. For
   procedures using their ``tls`` aliases (Available in MongoDB 4.2),
   see :ref:`configure-member-tls`.
   
   The ``tls`` settings/options provide **identical** functionality
   as the ``ssl`` options since MongoDB has always supported TLS 1.0
   and later.

            To specify the x.509 certificate for internal cluster member
            authentication, append the additional TLS/SSL options
            ``--clusterAuthMode`` and ``--sslClusterFile``, as in the
            following example for a member of a replica set:
