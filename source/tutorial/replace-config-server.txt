==============================
Replace Disabled Config Server
==============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Sharded clusters use a group of three config servers to store cluster
meta data, and all three config servers must be available to support
cluster metadata changes that include chunk splits and migrations. If
one of the config servers is unavailable or inoperable you must
replace it as soon as possible.

This procedure replaces an inoperable
:ref:`config server <sharding-config-server>` in a
:doc:`sharded cluster </core/sharding>`. Use this procedure only
to replace a config server that has become inoperable (e.g. hardware
failure).

This process assumes that the hostname of the instance will not change.
If you must change the hostname of the instance, use the procedure to
:doc:`migrate a config server and use a new hostname
<migrate-config-servers-with-different-hostnames>`.

Considerations
--------------

In the course of this procedure *never* remove a config server from the
:setting:`~sharding.configDB` parameter on any of the :program:`mongos`
instances.
