You can perform a transaction to run a series of operations that do not
change any data until the entire transaction is committed. This usage
example uses the **Core API** to perform a transaction.

.. seealso::
   
   To learn more about the performing transactions in the
   {+driver-short+}, see the :ref:`nodejs-transactions` guide.

   The {+driver-short+} also provides the Convenient Transaction API to
   perform transactions. To learn more about the Convenient Transaction
   API, see the :ref:`node-usage-convenient-txn` usage example.

Example
-------

Consider a situation in which a customer purchases items from your online
shop. To record the purchase, your application must update
your inventory and the customer's orders. Your
application also needs to save the order details.

The following table describes the collections that store purchase data
and how a purchase changes the data in each collection.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Collection
     - Operation
     - Description of the Change

   * - ``orders``
     - insert
     - Inserts a document that describes the order

   * - ``customers``
     - update or upsert
     - Appends the ``_id`` from the order document to the order history
       in the customer document

   * - ``inventory``
     - update
     - Updates the quantities of items available after a purchase

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The code examples use the following sample data in the ``testdb``
database:

- Documents in the ``customers`` collection that describe customers and
  their past orders
- Documents in the ``inventory`` collection that include quantities and
  descriptions of all items

The following document is in the ``customers`` collection:

.. code-block:: json

   { _id: 98765, orders: [] }

The ``inventory`` collection contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: json

   { item: "sunblock", item_id: 5432, qty: 85 },
   { item: "beach towel", item_id: 7865, qty: 41 }

You store purchase records in the ``orders`` collection of the
``testdb`` database. This collection is empty, as there have been no
purchases.

The code examples use the ``cart`` and ``payment`` variables to represent
a sample list of items purchased and the order payment details. The
following code describes the contents of the ``cart`` and ``payment`` variables:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const cart = [
     { item: 'sunblock', item_id: 5432, qty: 1, price: 5.19 },
     { item: 'beach towel', item_id: 7865, qty: 2, price: 15.99 }
   ];
   const payment = { customer: 98765, total: 37.17 };

.. _nodejs-transaction-core-api-example:

Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code example in this section demonstrates how to use the Core API to
perform a multi-document transaction in a session. In this example, the
transaction makes the changes needed when a customer purchases items from
your shop.

This example code performs a transaction through the following actions:

1. Calls the ``startSession()`` method to create a new session

#. Calls the ``startTransaction()`` method with an options parameter to
   create a new transaction

#. Performs the following operations within the transaction:

   * Inserts a document to the ``orders`` collection that contains
     information about the purchase and customer
   * Updates the ``inventory`` collection if there is
     sufficient inventory to fulfill the purchase
   * Ends the transaction and throws an exception if there isn't
     sufficient inventory for any item in the order
   * Adds the ID of the order to the list of past orders for the customer
   * Returns a message acknowledging that the transaction
     committed successfully with a copy of the purchase record

#. Calls the ``commitTransaction()`` method to commit the transaction if
   all operations complete successfully

#. Implements a ``catch`` block that contains error-handling logic

#. Calls the ``abortTransaction()`` method to end the transaction

#. Calls the ``endSession()`` method to end the session

Transaction Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the data changes created by the transaction.

The ``customers`` collection contains the customer document with an
order ``_id`` appended to the orders field:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     "_id": 98765,
     "orders": [
       "61dc..."
     ]
   }

The ``inventory`` collection contains updated quantities for the
items ``"sunblock"`` and ``"beach towel"``:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   [
     {
       "_id": ...,
       "item": "sunblock",
       "item_id": 5432,
       "qty": 84
     },
     {
       "_id": ...,
       "item": "beach towel",
       "item_id": 7865,
       "qty": 39
     }
   ]

The ``orders`` collection contains the order and payment
information:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   [
     {
       "_id": "...",
       "customer": 98765,
       "items": [
         {
           "item": "sunblock",
           "item_id": 5432,
           "qty": 1,
           "price": 5.19
         },
         {
           "item": "beach towel",
           "item_id": 7865,
           "qty": 2,
           "price": 15.99
         }
       ],
       "total": 37.17
     }
   ]
