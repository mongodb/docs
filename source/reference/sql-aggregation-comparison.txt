The :doc:`aggregation framework </core/aggregation>` allows
MongoDB to provide native aggregation capabilities that corresponds to
many common data aggregation operations in SQL. If you're new to
MongoDB you might want to consider the :doc:`/faq` section for a
selection of common questions.

The following table provides an overview of common SQL aggregation
terms, functions, and concepts and the corresponding MongoDB
:ref:`aggregation operators <aggregation-pipeline-operator-reference>`:

Examples
--------

The following table presents a quick reference of SQL aggregation
statements and the corresponding MongoDB statements. The examples in
the table assume the following conditions:

- The SQL examples assume *two* tables, ``orders`` and
  ``order_lineitem`` that join by the ``order_lineitem.order_id`` and
  the ``orders.id`` columns.

- The MongoDB examples assume *one* collection ``orders`` that contain
  documents of the following prototype:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       cust_id: "abc123",
       ord_date: ISODate("2012-11-02T17:04:11.102Z"),
       status: 'A',
       price: 50,
       items: [ { sku: "xxx", qty: 25, price: 1 },
                { sku: "yyy", qty: 25, price: 1 } ]
     }

- The MongoDB statements prefix the names of the fields from the
  :term:`documents <document>` in the collection ``orders`` with a
  ``$`` character when they appear as operands to the aggregation
  operations.
