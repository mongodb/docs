MongoDB Backup Methods
======================

When deploying MongoDB in production, you should have a strategy for
capturing and restoring backups in the case of data loss events. There
are a variety of different methods that you can use to back up
MongoDB, depending on your requirements and configuration.

Overview of Methods

* Employ MongoDB Management Service (MMS)
* Use mongodump and mongorestore tools
* Copy the Underlying Data Files

Backing up with MongoDB Management Service (MMS)
------------------------------------------------

MMS Backup (MMS) provides a fully managed backup solution for
MongoDB. MMS continually backs up MongoDB replica sets and sharded
systems by reading the oplog data from your MongoDB cluster.

MMS Backup offers point in time recovery of MongoDB replica sets and a
consistent snapshot of sharded systems.

MMS achieves point in time recovery by storing oplog data so that it
can recreate any moment in time within the last 24 hours for a
particular replica set.

For sharded systems, MMS can’t restore to any arbitrary moment in
time, but it does provide periodic consistent snapshots of the entire
sharded system, something that is difficult to achieve using any other
method of backing up MongoDB.

To restore your MongoDB cluster from an MMS Backup snapshot, you
download a compressed archive of your MongoDB data files and move
those files into position before restarting the mongod processes on
the various MongoDB nodes.

To get started with MMS Backup, see the MMS documentation.

Backing up with mongodump
-------------------------


:program:`mongodump` is used in conjunction with
:program:`mongorestore`. :program:`mongodump` creates backups by
querying the data in each targeted collection and writing that data to
a file. :program:`mongorestore` can take the output of
:program:`mongodump` and write that data to a MongoDB deployment.

:program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore` can operate both
online, against a running mongod process, and offline, by manipulating
the underlying database files.

:program:`mongodump` does not capture indexes and stores only the documents that
it backs up. The resulting backup is space efficient, but indexes must
be recreated after a restore.

When connected to a running mongod, the :program:`mongodump` --oplog option
creates a consistent point in time backup. Use the corresponding
:program:`mongorestore` --oplogReplay options to restore these
backups. 
while :program:`mongodump` with the --oplog option runs simultaneously.

To use the -oplog option to create a point-in-time backup, you must be
running a replica set versus a standalone mongod instance because only
a replica set produces the required oplog data. Even a single host can
run as a replica set.

:program:`mongodump` can adversely affect your database performance. When
connected to a MongoDB instance, :program:`mongodump` uses standard query and
write operations.  If your data is larger than memory, :program:`mongodump` can
cause a large amount of IO and force your previous working set out
memory.

Because :program:`mongodump` can have an adverse effect on performance, it is
advisable to run it on a secondary node of a replica set so that the
primary node remains responsive.  Alternatively, you can bring a
secondary node offline and use :program:`mongodump` in offline mode.  However, be
sure that your dump can complete before your oplog turns over or the
secondary node will need to perform a complete resynch from the
primary.

:program:`mongodump` does not back up the local database unless explicitly
specified.

To backup a sharded system using :program:`mongodump`, you must backup a replica
set node on every shard. Obtaining a snapshot corresponding to an
exact moment in time across a sharded system is difficult with
:program:`mongodump`. You can approximate a moment in time snapshot by bringing a
secondary node offline for each shard at approximately the same moment
and then running :program:`mongodump` on each offline host.

Despite the performance limitations of :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore`,
they can be quite useful for backing up and restoring a collection to
a running system.

See Back Up and Restore with MongoDB Tools, Backup a Small Sharded
Cluster with :program:`mongodump`, and Backup a Sharded Cluster with Database
Dumps for more information.


Copying the Underlying Data Files
---------------------------------

You can create a backup of MongoDB by copying the underlying data
files that MongoDB uses to operate and restoring them as needed.

If the volume where MongoDB stores data files supports point in time
snapshots, you can use these snapshots to create backups of a MongoDB
system at an exact moment in time. File systems snapshots are an
operating system volume manager feature. not a feature specific to
MongoDB.

The mechanics of snapshots depend on the underlying volume management
system. For example if you are using Amazon’s EBS storage system on
EC2, it directly supports snapshots. On Linux the LVM manager can create
a snapshot.

To get a correct snapshot of a running mongod process, you must have
journaling enabled within MongoDB. Without journaling enabled, there
is no guarantee that the snapshot will be consistent; there could be
half-written data.

The MongoDB journal file must reside on the same logical volume as the
other MongoDB data files for the snapshot to be consistent.

To get a consistent snapshot of a sharded system, you must snapshot a
replica set node of every shard and a config server at approximately
the same moment in time, while taking care to turn off the balancer
during the backup process.

File systems snapshots are efficient and do not impact performance
significantly if the underlying snapshot facility is well
implemented. They can also be space efficient if the snapshotting
feature of the volume manager supports incremental snapshots and
compression.

The primary drawback of using file systems snapshots is that they
don’t provide arbitrary point in time recovery for replica sets and
can be somewhat complicated to configure and manage for large sharded
systems.

If your storage system does not support snapshots, you can copy the
files directly.  Since, copying multiple files is not an atomic
operation, you must stop the MongoDB process before starting to copy
the files. Otherwise, you will copy the files in an inconsistent
state.

For more information, see the Backup and Restore with Filesystem
Snapshots and Backup a Sharded Cluster with Filesystem Snapshots for
complete instructions on using LVM to create snapshots. Also see Back
up and Restore Processes for MongoDB on Amazon EC2.

A drawback of simply copying and restoring files is that any
underlying fragmentation within the MongoDB data files, due to
documents being updated and deleted, will remain after you restore the
files. :program:`mongodump` and :program:`mongorestore`, in contrast,
have the effect of removing fragmentation.
