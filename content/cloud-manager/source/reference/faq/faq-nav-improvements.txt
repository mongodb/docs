We recently rolled out a new and improved navigation 
experience.

Why did we make these changes?
------------------------------

We redesigned the navigation to provide a more composable and scalable 
structure so that our developer data platform can grow over time. We 
improved the self-discovery of the wide array of services we offer and 
now provide clear navigation across services and resources. Ultimately, 
these changes set a foundation to support the growth of our products 
and services over time.

What's changing?
----------------

- We simplified the left sidebar navigation and organized it into the 
  following categories:

  - :guilabel:`Database`
  - :guilabel:`Admin`
  
  These categories provide distinct yet flexible containers that 
  display the breadth of our platform services and a clear division 
  between the main tasks.

- We clarified the resource context. The top navigation persists and 
  indicates the current resource (organization, project, 
  collection, and so on). You can easily switch between resources to 
  improve workflow continuity.

- We unified utilities. A centralized utility hub in the top-right 
  corner of the UI provides quick and easy access to essential tools 
  like alerts and support. You can also find links to MongoDB 
  University, Documentation, and Community Forums here.

- We removed the distinct product tabs. We now present all primary 
  services in the appropriate category beneath one consolidated sidebar 
  navigation, which makes these capabilities easier to find.

---------------------------------------------------------

At the organization level, you can now click :guilabel:`All Projects` 
to view a list of projects in an organization.

Where can I find billing information?
-------------------------------------

At the organization level, you can now click :guilabel:`Overview`, 
or :guilabel:`Invoices`, or :guilabel:`Linked Organizations` in the 
sidebar under the :guilabel:`Billing` heading.

At the organization level, you can now click the 
:guilabel:`Integrations` tab in the project or organization settings.

Where can I find my cluster?
----------------------------

At the project level, you can now click :guilabel:`Processes` in the 
sidebar under the :guilabel:`Database` header.

Where can I find my backups?
----------------------------

At the project level, you can now click :guilabel:`Continuous Backup` 
in the sidebar under the :guilabel:`Database` header.

Where can I find identity and access settings?
----------------------------------------------

From the project level settings, you can now find project identity and 
access settings under the :guilabel:`Identity & Access` header.

At the organization level, you can now find organization identity and 
access settings under the :guilabel:`Identity & Access` header.

You can also find these settings from the :guilabel:`Identity & Access Management` icon in the upper-right corner.

What pages were removed?
------------------------

The :guilabel:`Overview` page for your account, and the 
:guilabel:`Project Support Page` were removed.

When did the navigation changes launch? 
---------------------------------------

We rolled out the new navigation by organizations (for all users 
in an organization simultaneously) on October 13, 2025.

Can I turn off the new navigation experience?
---------------------------------------------

No, you cannot toggle off the new navigation experience.

What will I see when I first log in?
------------------------------------

You will see a modal that announces the change. After you click 
:guilabel:`See what's new`, a short guided tour shows the key changes. 
You can dismiss the tour at any time.

Where can I learn more?
-----------------------

There will be a series of announcements across our social channels and 
blogs.

If I have multiple organizations, will they change at the same time?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

No, we cannot guarantee that organizations under the same account will 
receive the navigation changes simultaneously. 

Is the documentation updated to reflect these changes?
------------------------------------------------------

Documentation updates that align with the new navigation are now 
live to everyone. We updated all pages to reflect the 
new navigation.

What products are impacted?
---------------------------

|service|, :atlas:`Atlas for Government </government>`, Charts, 
and |cloud| are impacted.
