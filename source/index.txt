|govcloud| is a fully-managed cloud database for the U.S. government 
(federal agencies and state, local, and education (SLED) entities),
developed by the same people that build MongoDB and |service|.

|govcloud| is only available for preview by invitation.

This documentation provides tutorials for common 
MongoDB Cloud tasks, reference material for features unique to 
|govcloud-short|, and high-level comparisons between |govcloud-short| 
and |service| features.

Many procedures and reference materials are identical across 
|govcloud-short| and |service|. In those cases, this documentation 
provides links to the relevant |service| documentation pages. 
**We recommend opening Atlas links in a new browser tab to save your place in the MongoDB CloudGov documentation.**

Links to |service| documentation pages are presented as either:

- Sections titled **See the Atlas Documentation** for important 
  procedures and information, or
- :guilabel:`Tips` for optional, further reading on a topic.
