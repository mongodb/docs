   Figure 1. The business impact of Purple Fabric.

Purple Fabric aligns with industry standards for security and regulatory 
compliance such as ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, SOC 2, |aws| WAR, and |aws| FTR. 
Purple Fabric monitors evolving AI regulations, including the EU AI Act, 
to ensure governance and compliance frameworks remain up to date 
with emerging legal and ethical standards.

Challenges in Enterprise AI Deployment
--------------------------------------

Common pain points include:

1. **Fragmented Enterprise Data**

   - Roughly 75% of enterprise data is unstructured, siloed, inconsistent, or untrusted.
   - Without enterprise-specific context, results from AI models lack accuracy.

2. **Micro-Automations vs. Macro Impact**

   - Most deployments execute isolated micro-tasks, limiting AI to narrow outputs without driving real business decisions or impact.
   - Without expert-level reasoning, collaboration, and orchestration, AI hits a ceiling in business value.

3. **Compliance & Governance Risks**

   - Proliferation of agents and |llm| raises serious risks, such as security, regulatory, and operational.
   - Enterprises lack centralized oversight and governance, stalling adoption at pilot stage.

4. **LLM Model Lock-in & Operational Costs**

   - Enterprises often face challenges with single-vendor |llm| solutions, including rising token costs and limitations in model flexibility.
   - Optimal accuracy, cost control, and long-term scalability require continuous benchmarking and selection of task-specific |llm|.

These challenges are addressed by Purple Fabric's comprehensive AI platform. 
Unlike isolated |llm| tools, Purple Fabric ensures:

- The **right knowledge** is accessible across the enterprise
- The **right digital experts** (agents) are doing the work
- The **right LLM** is chosen for each task
- The **right governance** ensures trust and control

Purple Fabric Platform: the Four Technology Stacks
--------------------------------------------------

Purple Fabric's architecture incorporates four foundational stacks 
designed for scalable and responsible data and AI management:

1. Enterprise Knowledge Garden (EKG).
2. Enterprise Digital Experts (EDE).
3. Enterprise Governance (EG).
4. Model Optimization Hub (MOH).

.. figure:: /includes/images/partners/purplefabric-tech-stacks.bakedsvg.svg
   :alt: The Four Technology Stacks of Purple Fabric.
   :figwidth: 1200px

   Figure 2. The Four Technology Stacks of Purple Fabric

Three of these stacks — **Enterprise Knowledge Garden (EKG)**, 
**Enterprise Digital Experts (EDE)**, and **Enterprise Governance (EG)** - rely on 
|service-fullname| to enable real-time knowledge retrieval, semantic search, 
contextual memory, and source document lineage for intelligent agents. 
MongoDB's flexible, high-performance infrastructure plays a critical role 
in supporting multi-agent systems with speed, precision, and traceability, 
ensuring that enterprise AI is not only intelligent, but also secure and auditable.

1. Enterprise Knowledge Garden: Data Transformation for AI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Purple Fabric's **Enterprise Knowledge Garden (EKG)** transforms structured, 
semi-structured, and unstructured data into decision-grade knowledge 
that is contextually rich, traceable, and continuously accessible by AI agents.

EKG ingests data from diverse sources and formats — including structured data 
from warehouses and APIs, semi-structured content like regulatory filings or 
industry reports, and unstructured assets such as PDFs, emails, and 
call transcripts. EKG uses a first-principles-driven approach to chunking 
and enrichment which mimics human understanding of content rather than 
relying solely on fixed token windows.

**The role of MongoDB:**

|service-fullname| serves as the data storage and retrieval backbone for EKG. 
Each enriched chunk is converted into a vector embedding and stored 
within MongoDB using :ref:`native vector indexing <avs-types-vector-search>`. 
By leveraging MongoDB's flexible document model, embeddings are stored 
alongside rich metadata — including source, document type, timestamp, 
and data lineage — ensuring deep context and traceability.

This results in a dynamic knowledge repository that is not only searchable 
but intelligent, providing contextual precision when feeding insights 
into large language models (|llm|). EKG supports tasks across various domains, 
such as summarizing a complaint case or cross-referencing contract clauses.

2. Enterprise Digital Experts: Multi-Agent Autonomous Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Purple Fabric's **Enterprise Digital Experts (EDE)** empowers users 
to build autonomous, domain-specific AI agent teams that can reason, 
collaborate, and take action independently.
Agents are crafted using low-code orchestration and natural language prompts, 
operating as atomic, molecular, or compound entities. They leverage advanced 
frameworks, such as `ReAct <https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/react-agent>`__, 
to incorporate planning, memory, and inter-agent Socratic dialogue 
for more refined decision-making and outcomes.

**The role of MongoDB:**

MongoDB handles the dynamic memory and state management of these agents. 
Each agent maintains its own working memory, task state, and contextual 
knowledge within MongoDB, enabling real-time persistence and retrieval 
of evolving states during multi-turn reasoning or user interactions.

When factual grounding is needed, agents invoke Retrieval-Augmented 
Generation (RAG) pipelines to access the Enterprise Knowledge Garden (EKG). 
|service-fullname| powers this pipeline by delivering fast, filtered access 
to the right vector embeddings and source documents based on query intent 
and similarity. This ensures that agents provide responses grounded 
in traceable, contextually relevant enterprise knowledge which minimizes 
hallucinations and maximizes reliability.

3. Enterprise Governance: Operational Compliance and Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Purple Fabric's **Enterprise Governance (EG)** stack enforces responsible AI 
by default, embedding compliance, security, and explainability into 
every layer of the system.

The governance layer oversees every aspect of the AI lifecycle, 
including data ingestion, agent orchestration, |llm| invocation, and final 
output generation. Its design ensures that every action is observable, 
auditable, and policy-compliant, enabling enterprises to meet internal 
risk requirements and external regulatory standards.

**Key governance capabilities include:** 

- **Prompt governance and toxicity detection:** Filtering unsafe or 
  non-compliant queries and responses.
- **Access controls and workspace isolation:** Segmenting roles, teams, 
  and visibility for secure collaboration.
- **PII masking and entity redaction:** Protecting sensitive data at both 
  the retrieval and output layers.
- **Rate limiting and usage tracking:** Monitoring token usage, 
  agent behavior, and preventing overuse.

**The role of MongoDB:**

MongoDB is foundational to Purple Fabric's governance framework, 
particularly in ensuring retrieval transparency and document lineage. 
When agents invoke RAG pipelines to ground their outputs, MongoDB stores 
embeddings, metadata, and source pointers for retrieved knowledge chunks. 
This creates a verifiable trail that maps the entire process — from input 
to retrieved knowledge to generated output — enabling post-hoc audits, 
compliance reviews, and root-cause analyses.

While Purple Fabric's control plane governs broader aspects like |llm| safety, 
agent reasoning, and user workflows, MongoDB enhances traceability, security, 
and validation of knowledge access at scale, reinforcing the platform's 
ability to meet the demands of regulated industries with confidence.

4. Model Optimisation Hub: Dynamic Model Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Purple Fabric's **Model Optimization Hub (MOH)** is designed to give 
enterprises the freedom and intelligence to choose the right |llm| for the task. 
It addresses one of the most critical challenges in scaling AI—balancing cost, 
accuracy, and performance across diverse use cases.

MOH allows teams to benchmark multiple |llm| against real-world tasks 
such as summarisation, extraction, classification, reasoning, or validation. 
These evaluations are based on customisable metrics like latency, token 
consumption, output precision, and more, which are all tracked through 
real-time testing and usage data.

Once benchmarked, models can be:

- **Pinned** to specific agents or use cases based on performance
- **Switched** dynamically depending on cost/latency constraints
- **Tuned** with prompt engineering and few-shot examples for domain specificity

MOH also supports bring-your-own-model (BYOM) capabilities, allowing 
enterprises to plug in proprietary or fine-tuned |llm| running on their own 
infrastructure or via private endpoints for use cases that demand higher 
control, data sovereignty, or custom domain adaptation.
This modularity ensures that enterprises can avoid vendor lock-in, maintain 
performance across changing use cases, and optimize |llm| economics without 
sacrificing quality or compliance.

Use Cases: How Multi-Agent AI Transforms Enterprise Operations
--------------------------------------------------------------

Purple Fabric's multi-agent architecture is designed to tackle complex, 
end-to-end business challenges—not just isolated tasks. By combining its 
core pillars with robust orchestration, enterprises can achieve outcomes 
that are faster, smarter, and fully grounded in enterprise context.

Use Case: Complaints Investigation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Transforming a five-week manual process into an AI-driven solution that 
delivers results in minutes.*

A leading wealth manager in the UK faced a crisis when new consumer duty 
regulations triggered a surge of over 50% in customer complaints. 
With more than 10,000 unresolved cases piling up, the firm was overwhelmed 
by lengthy investigation cycles. Solving a single complaint took up to 
five weeks, requiring investigators to manually pull information from over 
10 systems—including policy admin databases, CRM tools, internal documents, 
and regulatory updates.

The process was burdened with inefficiencies: fragmented data sources, 
high error rates, and an inability to adapt to evolving policies and regulations. 
With less than 30% of complaints resolved within SLA timelines, the firm 
struggled with growing customer dissatisfaction and mounting compliance risks.

Purple Fabric transformed this process by deploying a production-grade 
multi-agent system for complaint investigation, designed to act, reason, 
and collaborate with speed and consistency.

The solution orchestrated a team of over 20 intelligent agents, each 
specialized for a part of the workflow. Some agents focused on extracting 
and logging complaint details, others verified policy terms, ran precedent 
checks, gathered evidence across systems, or wrote structured investigation 
reports. A Complaints Manager agent coordinated the entire flow, and a 
Human-in-the-Loop interface ensured compliance and oversight for final decisions.

**The results?**

What previously took five weeks of manual handoffs is now completed in minutes. 
The AI-powered system autonomously handles evidence gathering, classification, 
investigation, and adjudication with auditability and consistency:

- 22 processes integrated across 11 systems
- 20+ AI agents collaborating autonomously with humans in the loop
- End-to-end process time reduced from weeks to minutes

Purple Fabric's innovative complaints resolution framework transformed 
how investigations are managed—unlocking speed, quality, and scale 
while minimizing compliance risks.

Use Case: Corporate Intelligence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*From 100,000 person-days to intelligent ESG insights.*

A leading institutional investor managing a portfolio of over 9,000 companies 
faced a daunting challenge: integrating ESG (Environmental, Social, and 
Governance) insights into portfolio analysis. ESG data was highly fragmented 
across thousands of sources—including reports, disclosures, filings, and 
news articles—resulting in an overwhelming 10 million documents for analysts 
to sift through manually.

Portfolios shifted by nearly 10% each month, ESG ratings proved inconsistent, 
and mounting regulatory pressure demanded sustainability alignment. 
Analysts spent an estimated 100,000 person-days annually reviewing documents, 
piecing together insights, and generating reports—an effort that was both 
time-intensive and error-prone.

Purple Fabric transformed this process by deploying a multi-agent Corporate 
Intelligence system designed to automate and elevate ESG analysis.

The solution began with agents that ingested ESG documents across structured 
and unstructured formats, creating a unified ESG knowledge garden. 
Then, specialised digital experts extracted and aligned data to client-specific 
ESG guidelines ensuring that every insight mapped to the investor's frameworks.

Agents like the Environment Agent, Social Data Agent, and Governance Data Agent 
parsed sustainability-related information at scale. A 360 Analyst Agent 
created holistic company profiles. A Query Agent enabled users to interrogate 
the entire portfolio using natural language, and a Reporting Agent generated 
investor-ready summaries which were all traceable and audit-ready.

To keep the intelligence real-time, APIs were used to ingest news and 
external data feeds, enabling agents to perform sentiment analysis on 
the latest ESG developments. This allowed the platform to identify emerging 
risks and opportunities across companies, ahead of manual review cycles.

Every insight was grounded in original data with explainability by design. 
And since agents operated with real-time access to both historical records 
and live APIs, the analysis was always current.

**The results?**

- Near 100% portfolio coverage
- Over 90% accuracy in extracted ESG records
- 1,000× faster turnaround times compared to traditional methods
- 100,000 specialist person-days saved annually


What once required brute-force manual review now runs on intelligent, 
collaborative agents, delivering ESG analysis with unprecedented speed, 
scale, and traceability.

Deployment Considerations
-------------------------

Purple Fabric offers deployment models that align with an organisation's 
existing infrastructure, data residency policies, and compliance requirements.
Enterprises can choose from two primary deployment options:

Deploy within your own VPC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enterprises can host Purple Fabric entirely within their own cloud environment, 
typically on |aws| or |azure|, enabling them to maintain full control over data, 
access, and infrastructure. In this model, all enterprise knowledge, 
agent orchestration, and governance components run inside the client's own 
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), adhering to their internal security, audit, 
and compliance policies. 

Dedicated Tenant on Intellect's Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For enterprises seeking faster deployment without infrastructure overhead, 
Purple Fabric can be provisioned as a dedicated tenant on Intellect's 
secure cloud. Enterprises connect their internal systems via private, 
credential-based connections that ensure data access remains secure and 
tightly governed. Each tenant is logically isolated with independent 
governance, observability, and compute controls, ensuring enterprise-grade 
security while accelerating time-to-production.

Regardless of the deployment path, Purple Fabric offers:

- **Built-in monitoring and observability:** Including real-time dashboards, 
  cost tracking, agent execution trails, and system health metrics
- **Secure access to enterprise systems:** Managed via the Credentials Module, 
  which stores and encrypts API keys, database credentials, and email 
  connector tokens for seamless and secure integration
- **Security and access control:** Granular, role-based access and 
  workspace-level isolation
- **Auditability and compliance:** Every document retrieval, agent action, 
  and |llm| output is logged for end-to-end traceability, with support for 
  encryption at rest and in transit

Whether hosted within an enterprise's cloud environment or managed as a secure, 
isolated tenant in Intellect's cloud, Purple Fabric ensures that AI 
is deployed securely, monitored transparently, and governed at every step.
