Indexing Operations
===================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Synopsis
--------

Indexes allow MongoDB to process and fulfill queries quickly, by
creating an small and efficient representation of the documents in the
collection. Fundamentally, indexes in MongoDB are operationally
similar to indexes in other database systems. Read the
":doc:`/core/indexes`" documentation for more information on the
fundamentals of indexing in MongoDB, and the
":doc:`/applications/indexes`" documentation for practical strategies
and examples for using indexes in your application.

This document, provides operational guidelines and procedures related
to indexing data in MongoDB collections.

Operations
----------

Creation
~~~~~~~~

Use the :func:`db.collection.ensureIndex()`, or similar :api:`method
for your driver <>`, to create an index. Consider the following
prototype operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { a: 1 } )

The following example creates [#ensure]_ an index on the ``phone-number`` field
of the ``people`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.people.ensureIndex( { phone-number: 1 } )

To create a :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>`, use an
operation that resembles the following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 } )

For example, the following operation will create an index on the
``item``, ``category``, and ``price`` fields of the ``products``
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.ensureIndex( { item: 1, category: 1, price: 1 } )

.. note::

   To build indexes for a :term:`replica set`, before version 2.2,
   see :ref:`index-building-replica-sets`.

.. [#ensure] As the name suggests, :func:`ensureIndex() <db.collection.ensureIndex()>`
   only creates an index if an index of the same specification does
   not already exist.

Sparse
``````

To create a :ref:`sparse index <index-type-sparse>` on a field, use an
operation that resembles the following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { a: 1 }, { sparse: true } )

The following example creates a sparse index on the ``users``
table that *only* indexes the ``twitter_name`` *if* a document has
this field. This index will not include documents in this collection
without the ``twitter_name`` field.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.users.ensureIndex( { twitter_name: 1 }, { sparse: true } )

.. note::

   MongoDB cannot create sparse compound indexes.

Unique
``````

To create a :ref:`unique indexes <index-type-unique>`, consider the
following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { a: 1 }, { unique: true } )

For example, you may want to create a unique index on the ``tax-id:``
of the ``accounts`` collection to prevent storing multiple account
records for the same legal entity:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.accounts.ensureIndex( { tax-id: 1 }, { unique: true } )

The :ref:`_id index <index-type-primary>` is a unique index. In some
situations you may want to use the ``_id`` field for these primary
data rather than using a unique index on another field.

In many situations you will want to combine the ``unique`` constraint
with the ``sparse`` option. When MongoDB indexes a field, if a
document does not have a value for a field, the index entry for that
item will be ``null``. Since unique indexes cannot have duplicate
values for a field, without the ``sparse`` option, MongoDB will reject
the second document and all subsequent documents without the indexed
field. Consider the following prototype.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { a: 1 }, { unique: true, sparse: true } )

You can also enforce a unique constraint on :ref:`compound indexes
<index-type-compound-index>`, as in the following prototype:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { a: 1, b: 1 }, { unique: true } )

These indexes enforce uniqueness for the *combination* of index keys
and *not* for either key individually.

Removal
~~~~~~~

To remove an index, use the :func:`db.collection.dropIndex()` method,
as in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.accounts.dropIndex( { tax-id: 1 } )

This will remove the index on the ``tax-id`` field in the ``accounts``
collection. The shell provides the following document after completing
the operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "nIndexesWas" : 3, "ok" : 1 }

Where the value of ``nIndexesWas`` reflects the number of indexes
*before* removing this index. You can also use the
:func:`db.collection.dropIndexes()` to remove *all* indexes, except
for the :ref:`_id index <index-type-primary>` from a collection.

These shell helpers provide wrappers around the
:dbcommand:`deleteIndexes` :term:`database command`. Your :ref:`client
library </applications/drivers>` may have a different or additional
interface for these operations.

Rebuilding
~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to rebuild indexes for a collection you can use the
:func:`db.collection.reIndex()` method. This will drop all indexes,
including the :ref:`_id index <index-type-primary>`, and then rebuild
all indexes. The operation takes the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.accounts.reIndex()

MongoDB will return the following document when the operation
completes:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
           "nIndexesWas" : 2,
           "msg" : "indexes dropped for collection",
           "nIndexes" : 2,
           "indexes" : [
                   {
                           "key" : {
                                   "_id" : 1,
                                   "tax-id" : 1
                           },
                           "ns" : "records.accounts",
                           "name" : "_id_"
                   }
           ],
           "ok" : 1
   }

This shell helper provides a wrapper around the :dbcommand:`reIndex`
:term:`database command`. Your :ref:`client library
</applications/drivers>` may have a different or additional interface
for this operation.

.. note::

   To rebuild indexes for a :term:`replica set`, before version 2.2,
   see :ref:`index-rebuilding-replica-sets`.

Special Creation Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   TTL collections use a special ``expire`` index option. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/expire-data` for more information.

Background
``````````

To create an index in the background you can specify :ref:`background
construction <index-creation-background>`. Consider the following
prototype invocation of :func:`db.collection.ensureIndex()`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { a: 1 }, { background: true } )

Drop Duplicates
```````````````

To force the creation of a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>`
index, you can use the ``dropDups`` option. This will force MongoDB to
create a *unique* index by deleting documents with duplicate values
when building the index. Consider the following prototype invocation
of :func:`db.collection.ensureIndex()`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.ensureIndex( { a: 1 }, { dropDups: true } )

See the full documentation of :ref:`duplicate dropping
<index-creation-duplicate-dropping>` for more information.

.. warning::

   Specifying ``{ dropDups: true }`` will delete data from your
   database. Use with extreme caution.

.. _index-building-replica-sets:

Building Indexes Replica Set
----------------------------

In Version 1.8 and 2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Version 1.8 and 2.0, :ref:`background index creation operations
<index-creation-background>` become *foreground* indexing operations
on :term:`secondary` members of replica sets. These foreground
operations will block all replication on the secondaries, and can
impact performance of the entire set. To build indexes with minimal
impact on a replica set, use the following procedure for all
non-trivial index builds:

#. Stop the :program:`mongod` process on one secondary. Restart the
   :program:`mongod`  process *without* the :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>`
   option. This instance is now in "standalone" mode.

#. Create the new index or rebuild the index on this :program:`mongod`
   instance.

#. Restart the :program:`mongod` instance with the
   :option:`--replSet <mongod --replSet>` option. Allow replication to
   catch up on this node.

#. Replete this operation on all of the remaining secondaries.

#. Run :func:`rs.stepDown()` on the :term:`primary` member of the set,
   and then run this procedure on the former primary.

.. warning::

   Ensure that your :ref:`oplog` is large enough to permit the
   indexing or re-indexing operation to complete without falling too
   far behind to catch up. See the ":ref:`replica-set-oplog-sizing`"
   documentation for additional information.

.. note::

   This procedure *does* block indexing on one member of the replica
   set at a time. However, the foreground indexing operation is more
   efficient than the background index operation, and will only affect
   one secondary at a time rather than *all* secondaries at the same
   time.

.. rebuild indexes on secondaries and cycle so that there's never a
   failover.

In Version 2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 2.2

Rebuild operation on :term:`secondary` members of :term:`replica sets
<replica set>` now run as normal background index operations. Run
:func:`ensureIndex() <db.collection.ensureIndex()>` normally with the
``{ background: true }`` option for replica sets. Alternatively, you
may always use the above operation to isolate and control the impact
of indexing building operations on a set as a whole.

Measuring Index Utilization
---------------------------

Query performance is a good general indicator of index utilization;
however, for more precise insight into index use, MongoDB provides the
following tools:

- :func:`explain() <cursor.explain()>`

  Append the :func:`explain() <cursor.explain()>` method to any cursor
  (e.g. query) to return a document with statistics about the query
  process, including the index used, and the number of documents
  scanned.

- :func:`cursor.hint()`

  Append the :func:`hint() <cursor.hint()>` to any cursor (e.g.
  query) with the name of an index as the argument to *force* MongoDB
  to use a specific index to fulfill the query. Consider the following
  example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     db.people.find( { name: "John Doe", zipcode: { $gt: 63000 } } } ).hint( { zipcode: 1 } )


  You can use :func:`hint() <cursor.hint()>` and :func:`explain()
  <cursor.explain()>` in conjunction with each other to compare the
  effectiveness of a specific index.

- :status:`indexCounters`

  Use the :status:`indexCounters` data in the output of
  :dbcommand:`serverStatus` for insight into database-wise index
  utilization.
