"Indexes allow MongoDB to process and fulfill queries quickly by creating "
"small and efficient representations of the documents in a "
":term:`collection`. MongoDB supports indexes that include content on a "
"single field, as well as :ref:`compound indexes <index-type-compound>` that "
"include content from multiple fields. Continue reading for instructions and "
"examples of building a compound index."
