  .. include:: /includes/admonitions/ubi-8-min-db-versions.rst

  .. note::

     If you update this value to a later version, consider setting
     :ref:`spec.featureCompatibilityVersion <multi-spec-fcv>` to give yourself the
     option to downgrade if necessary.


.. _optional-multi-k8s-settings:

Optional ``MongoDBMultiCluster`` Resource Settings
--------------------------------------------------

|mongodb-multis| can use the following settings:

.. _multi-spec-additionalmongodconfig:

``spec.additionalMongodConfig``
  *Type*: collection

  Additional :opsmgr:`configuration options
  </reference/deployment-advanced-options/>` with
  which you want to start MongoDB processes.

  The |k8s-op-short| supports all configuration options that the MongoDB
  version you deploy through the {+mdbagent+} supports, except that the 
  |k8s-op-short| overrides values that you provide for any of the 
  following options:

  - ``net.tls.certificateKeyFile``
  - ``net.tls.clusterFile``
  - ``net.tls.PEMKeyFile``
  - ``replication.replSetName``
  - ``security.clusterAuthMode``
  - ``sharding.clusterRole``
  - ``storage.dbPath``
  - ``systemLog.destination``
  - ``systemLog.path``

  To learn more about the configuration options that the |k8s-op-short|
  owns, see :ref:`k8s-exclusive-settings`.

  To learn which configuration options you can use, see
  :opsmgr:`Advanced Options for MongoDB Deployments
  </reference/deployment-advanced-options/>` in the |onprem| 
  documentation.

.. _multi-spec-agent:

``spec.agent``
  *Type*: collection

  {+mdbagent+} configuration settings for the MongoDB database resource.

.. _multi-spec-agent-startupoption:

``spec.agent.startupOptions``
  *Type*: collection

  {+mdbagent+} settings with which you want to start the MongoDB database resource.

  You must provide MongoDB Agent settings as key-value pairs. The values
  must be strings.  
  For a list of supported {+mdbagent+} settings, see:

  - :cloudmgr:`MongoDB Agent Settings </reference/mongodb-agent-settings/>`
    for |cloud-short| projects.
  - :opsmgr:`MongoDB Agent Settings
    </reference/mongodb-agent-settings/>` for the |onprem| version you
    deployed with the |k8s-op-short|. 

.. _multi-spec-backup:

``spec.backup``
  *Type*: collection

  The collection container for :ref:`spec.backup.mode <multi-spec-backup-mode>`,
  which enables continuous backups for MongoDB resources in |k8s-op-short|.

.. _multi-spec-backup-assignmentLabels:

``spec.backup.assignmentLabels``
  *Type*: array

  A list of assignment labels for the :ref:`backup-daemon` processes.
  Use assignment labels to identify that specific backup daemon
  processes are associated with particular projects. If you set assignment
  labels using the |k8s-op-short|, the values that you set in the |k8s|
  configuration file for assignment labels override the values defined
  in the |mms| UI. Assignment labels that you don't set using the
  |k8s-op-short| continue to use the values set in the |mms| UI.

.. _multi-spec-backup-autoterminateondeletion:

``spec.backup.autoTerminateOnDeletion``
  *Type*: boolean

  Flag that indicates whether the |k8s-op-short| stops and terminates the
  backup when you delete a |mongodb-multi|. The default value is ``false``.
  Setting this flag to ``true`` is useful when you want to delete the
  |mongodb-multi| while the :ref:`spec.backup.mode <multi-spec-backup-mode>` setting
  is set to ``enabled``.

.. _multi-spec-backup-encryption:

``spec.backup.encryption``
  *Type*: object

  Object that contains the backup encryption configuration settings.

.. _multi-spec-backup-encryption-kmip:

``spec.backup.encryption.kmip``
  *Type*: object

  Object that contains the |kmip| backup encryption configuration 
  settings. To learn more, see :ref:`configure-kmip-backup-encryption`.

.. _multi-spec-backup-encryption-kmip-client:

``spec.backup.encryption.kmip.client``
  *Type*: object

  Object that contains the |kmip| backup encryption client configuration 
  settings.

.. _multi-spec-backup-mode:

``spec.backup.mode``
  *Type*: string
  
  Enables continuous backups for a |mongodb-multi|.
  Possible values are ``enabled``, ``disabled``, and
  ``terminated``.
  
  .. note::

     The :ref:`spec.backup.mode <multi-spec-backup-mode>`
     setting relies on :ref:`Backup <om-rsrc-backup>` that is
     enabled in |onprem| and requires that the
     :opsmgrkube:`spec.backup.enabled`
     value in the |onprem| :ref:`resource specification
     <k8s-om-specification>` is set to ``true``.
  
  After you enable continuous backups for your MongoDB resource with
  :ref:`spec.backup.mode <multi-spec-backup-mode>`, you can :ref:`check the backup status
  <get-resource-status>`.

.. _multi-spec-backup-snapshotschedule:

``spec.backup.snapshotSchedule``
  *Type*: collection

  Collection container for snapshot schedule settings for
  continuous backups for MongoDB resources in |k8s-op-short|.

.. _multi-spec-dailysnapshotretentiondays:

``spec.backup.snapshotSchedule.dailySnapshotRetentionDays``
  *Type*: number
  
  Number of days to keep daily snapshots. You can set a value 
  between ``1`` and ``365``, inclusive. Setting the value to ``0``
  disables this rule.

.. _multi-spec-fullincrementaldayofweek:

``spec.backup.snapshotSchedule.fullIncrementalDayOfWeek``
  *Type*: string
  
  Day of the week when |onprem| takes a full snapshot. This setting 
  ensures a recent complete backup. |onprem| sets the default value to
  ``SUNDAY``.

.. _multi-spec-monthlysnapshotretentionmonths:

``spec.backup.snapshotSchedule.monthlySnapshotRetentionMonths``
  *Type*: number
  
  Number of months to keep monthly snapshots. You can set a value 
  between ``1`` and ``36``, inclusive. Setting the value to ``0``
  disables this rule.
 
.. _multi-spec-pointintimewindowhours:

``spec.backup.snapshotSchedule.pointInTimeWindowHours``
  *Type*: number
  
  Number of hours in the past for which you can create a point-in-time
  snapshot.

.. _multi-spec-referencehourofday:

``spec.backup.snapshotSchedule.referenceHourOfDay``
  *Type*: number
  
  |utc| hour of the day to schedule snapshots using a 24 hour clock.
  You can set a value between ``0`` and ``23``, inclusive.

.. _spec-referenceminuteofhour:

``spec.backup.snapshotSchedule.referenceMinuteOfHour``
  *Type*: number
  
  |utc| minute of the hour to schedule snapshots. You can
  set a value between ``0`` and ``59``, inclusive.

.. _multi-spec-snapshotintervalhours:

``spec.backup.snapshotSchedule.snapshotIntervalHours``
  *Type*: number
  
  Number of hours between snapshots. You can set a value of ``6``,
  ``8``, ``12``, or ``24``.

.. _multi-spec-snapshotretentiondays:

``spec.backup.snapshotSchedule.snapshotRetentionDays``
  *Type*: number
  
  Number of days to keep recent snapshots. You can set a value 
  between ``2`` and ``5``, inclusive.   

.. _multi-spec-weeklysnapshotretentionweeks:

``spec.backup.snapshotSchedule.weeklySnapshotRetentionWeeks``
  *Type*: number
  
  Number of weeks to keep weekly snapshots. You can set a value 
  between ``1`` and ``52``, inclusive. Setting the value to ``0``
  disables this rule.

.. _multi-spec-cloudmanager-configmapref-name:

``spec.cloudManager.configMapRef.name``
  *Type*: string

  Alias for :ref:`spec.opsManager.configMapRef.name <multi-spec-opsmanager-configmapref-name>`.

.. _multi-spec-clusterdomain:

``spec.clusterDomain``
  *Type*: string

  *Default*: cluster.local

  Domain name of the |k8s| cluster where you deploy the |k8s-op-short|. When
  |k8s| creates a |k8s-statefulset|, the |k8s| assigns each |k8s-pod| a
  |fqdn|. To update |com|, the |k8s-op-short| calculates the |fqdn| for
  each Pod using a provided cluster name. |k8s| doesn't provide
  an |api| to query these hostnames.

  .. warning::

     You must set ``spec.clusterDomain`` if your |k8s| cluster has
     a :k8sdocs:`default domain
     </concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service#what-things-get-dns-names>`
     other than the default ``cluster.local``. If you neither use the
     default nor set the ``spec.clusterDomain`` option, the
     |k8s-op-short| might not function as expected. 

.. _multi-spec-clusterspeclist:

``spec.clusterSpecList``
  *Type*: collection

  List of specifications for each |k8s| cluster in a |mongodb-multi|.

.. _multi-spec-agent-clusterspeclist-clustername:

``spec.clusterSpecList.clusterName``
  *Type*: string 

  Name of the cluster where the |k8s-op| schedules the |k8s-statefulset|. When the |k8s-op-short| deploys this |mongodb-multi|, it creates :k8sdocs:`a service account </concepts/security/service-accounts/>`. This name is what the service account in the central cluster uses to communicate with the workload clusters. 

.. _multi-spec-clusterspeclist-exposedexternally:

``spec.clusterSpecList.exposedExternally``
  *Type*: boolean

  *Default*: false

  .. important::
     
     ``spec.clusterSpecList.exposedExternally`` is deprecated and will be removed in a
     future release. To expose your |multi-cluster|, provide global values using the
     :ref:`spec.externalAccess <multi-spec-externalaccess>` settings and cluster-specific
     overrides using the :ref:`spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalService <multi-spec-clusterspeclist-externalservice>` settings.

  Determines whether a |multi-cluster| is exposed outside the |k8s| clusters. 
  Setting ``spec.clusterSpecList.exposedExternally: true`` is equivalent to setting ``spec.externalAccess: {}``. See :ref:`spec.externalAccess <multi-spec-externalaccess>` for details.

.. _multi-spec-clusterspeclist-externaldomain:

``spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalDomain``
  *Type*: string

  Top-level domain used to externally expose your |multi-cluster|.

  When you add a top-level domain, ``processes[n].hostname`` in the :opsmgr:`automation configuration </reference/cluster-configuration/>`
  creates a value that is a subdomain of this top-level domain in the format ``<replica-set-name>-<cluster-idx>-<pod-idx>.<externalDomain>``.
  For example, ``multi-replica-set-0-1.cluster-0.example.com``. The {+mdbagent+} uses this
  hostname to connect to |mongod|.

  .. warning::

     Specifying this field changes how |mongod| processes are registered in |onprem|.
     You can only specify this field for new deployments. You can't change
     the value of this field or any ``processes[n].hostname`` fields in the automation
     configuration for a running deployment.

  .. important::
   
     Use this setting only when deploying a |multi-cluster| replica set *without
     a service mesh*.

.. _multi-spec-clusterspeclist-externalservice:

``spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalService``
  *Type*: collection

  Configuration for externally exposing a specific cluster in your |multi-cluster|. These settings
  override the global :ref:`spec.externalAccess.externalService <multi-spec-externalaccess-externalservice>` settings.

.. _multi-spec-clusterspeclist-annotations:

``spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalService.annotations``
  *Type*: collection

  Key-value pairs that let you add cloud provider-specific
  configuration settings to a specific cluster in your |multi-cluster|. This setting overrides the global
  setting, :ref:`spec.externalAccess.externalService.annotations <multi-spec-externalaccess-externalservice-annotations>`. 

  To learn more about
  :k8sdocs:`Annotations </concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/>`,
  see the |k8s| documentation.

  For more details, consult the documentation for your |k8s| cloud provider.

.. _multi-spec-clusterspeclist-spec:

``spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalService.spec``
  *Type*: collection

  Configuration for the :k8sdocs:`ServiceSpec </reference/kubernetes-api/service-resources/service-v1/#ServiceSpec>`.

.. _multi-spec-clusterspeclist-memberconfig:

``spec.clusterSpecList.memberConfig``
  *Type*: collection

  Specification for the MongoDB replica set members in your |multi-cluster|.

.. _multi-spec-clusterspeclist-memberconfig-priority:

``spec.clusterSpecList.memberConfig.priority``
  *Type*: string

  Number that indicates the relative eligibility of a MongoDB replica set member to become a `primary <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/glossary/#std-term-primary>`__.

  Specify a higher value to make a member more eligible to become primary, and lower values to make the member less eligible. For example, a member with a ``spec.clusterSpecList.memberConfig.priority`` of ``"1.5"`` is more likely than ``"0.5"`` to become a primary. A priority of ``"0"`` is ineligible to become primary. For more details, see `Member Priority <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/replica-set-elections/#voting-members>`__.

.. _multi-spec-clusterspeclist-memberconfig-tags:

``spec.clusterSpecList.memberConfig.tags``
  *Type*: map

  Map of `replica set tags <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/tutorial/configure-replica-set-tag-sets/>`__ for directing
  read and write operations to specific members of your MongoDB replica set.

.. _multi-spec-clusterspeclist-memberconfig-votes:

``spec.clusterSpecList.memberConfig.votes``
  *Type*: number

  Determines whether a MongoDB replica set member can vote in an :manual:`election </core/replica-set-elections/#voting-members>`. Set to ``1`` to allow the member to vote. Set to ``0`` to exclude the member from an election. 

.. _spec-clusterspeclist-members:

``spec.clusterSpecList.members``
  *Type*: number

  Number of members in the MongoDB replica set.

.. _spec-clusterspeclist-service:

``spec.clusterSpecList.service``
  *Type*: string

  *Default*: <resource_name>+"-service"

  Name of the |k8s| service you want to create or use for a
  |k8s-statefulset|. If a service with this name already exists, the
  |k8s-op-full| does not delete or recreate it. This setting lets
  you create your own custom services and lets the |k8s-op-short|
  reuse them.

.. _spec-clusterspeclist-statefulset-spec:

``spec.clusterSpecList.statefulSet.spec``
  *Type*: collection

  Provides the configuration for the |k8s-statefulset| override for each of
  the cluster's StatefulSets in a |multi-cluster|. To set the global configuration that
  applies to all clusters in your |multi-cluster|, see :ref:`spec.statefulSet.spec <multi-spec-statefulset-spec>`.

  This setting applies only to replica set resource types in |multi-clusters|.

.. _multi-spec-connectivity-replicasethorizons:

``spec.connectivity.replicaSetHorizons``
  *Type*: collection

  Allows you to provide different |dns| settings for client
  applications and the {+mdbagent+}s. The |k8s-op-short| uses split
  horizon |dns| for replica set members. This feature allows
  communication both within the |k8s| cluster and from outside |k8s|.

  You can add multiple external mappings per host.

  .. note::

     - Make sure that each value in this array is unique.

     - Make sure that the number of entries in this array matches the
       value given in :ref:`spec.clusterSpecList.members <spec-clusterspeclist-members>`.

     - Provide a value for the
       :ref:`spec.security.certsSecretPrefix <multi-spec-security-certssecretprefix>` setting to
       enable |tls|. This method to use split horizons requires the
       Server Name Indication extension of the |tls| protocol.

     - :ref:`Configure the routing for external hostnames <connect-from-outside-k8s>`.

  In this example, clients communicate with the replica set using the ``example-website``
  horizon.

  .. literalinclude:: /includes/code-examples/yaml-files/example-replica-set.yaml
     :language: yaml
     :start-after: START-horizon-addcert-replset-lower
     :end-before: END-horizon-addcert-replset-lower
     :linenos:
     :lineno-start: 15

.. _multi-spec-duplicateserviceobjects:

``spec.duplicateServiceObjects``
  *Type*: boolean

  *Default*: true

  Specifies whether the |k8s-op-short| duplicates a Pod's service mesh object in each cluster to allow |dns| resolution. Set to ``false`` if you configure a DNS proxy for your service mesh. For example, see `DNS  Proxying <https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/configuration/traffic-management/dns-proxy/>`__ in the Istio  documentation. 

.. _multi-spec-externalaccess:

``spec.externalAccess``
  *Type*: collection

  Specification for externally exposing your |multi-cluster| to the outside world. These settings apply to services across all clusters. To override these global settings in a specific cluster, use :ref:`spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalService <multi-spec-clusterspeclist-externalservice>`.

  When you add ``spec.externalAccess``, even with no values, the |k8s-op-short| creates an
  external service for each Pod in a replica set. External services provide
  an external entry point for each MongoDB database Pod in a cluster.

  By default, every external service has:

  - ``Name = <pod-name>-svc-external``. You can't change this name.
  - ``Type = LoadBalancer``.
  - A port for |mongod|. If you set :ref:`spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalDomain <multi-spec-clusterspeclist-externaldomain>`, the external service adds another port (``port value + 1``) for backups.
  - ``publishNotReadyAddress = true``. Do not set to ``false`` for any database Pod.
  - Selectors that match the external service to a specific Pod.

.. _multi-spec-externalaccess-externalservice:

``spec.externalAccess.externalService``
  *Type*: collection

  Specification for overriding the default values in :ref:`spec.externalAccess <multi-spec-externalaccess>`.

  For details, see :k8sdocs:`ServiceSpec </reference/kubernetes-api/service-resources/service-v1/#ServiceSpec>` in the |k8s| documentation.

.. _multi-spec-externalaccess-externalservice-annotations:

``spec.externalAccess.externalService.annotations``
  *Type*: collection

  Key-value pairs that let you add cloud provider-specific
  configuration settings to all clusters in your |multi-cluster|. For cluster-specific overrides,
  see :ref:`spec.clusterSpecList.externalAccess.externalService.annotations <multi-spec-clusterspeclist-annotations>`.

  To learn more about
  :k8sdocs:`Annotations </concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/>`,
  see the |k8s| documentation.

  For more details, consult the documentation for your |k8s| cloud provider.

.. _multi-spec-fcv:

``spec.featureCompatibilityVersion``
  *Type*: number

  Limits changes to data that occur with an upgrade to a
  new major version. This allows you to downgrade to the previous major
  version. To learn more about feature compatibility, see :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`
  in the MongoDB Manual.

.. _multi-spec-loglevel:

``spec.logLevel``
  *Type*: string

  Configures the level of Automation Agent logging inside the
  |k8s-pod|. Accepted values include:

  - ``DEBUG``

  deploy the |k8s-op-short|:

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl create secret generic ldap-agent-user \
     --from-literal="password=<password>" -n <metadata.namespace>

  This secret must contain one key, the value of which matches the
  password of the
  :ref:`spec.security.authentication.agents.automationUserName <multi-spec-security-automationusername>` user
  in your LDAP deployment.

  This setting is required if 
  :ref:`spec.security.authentication.agents.mode <multi-spec-security-agents-mode>` is ``LDAP``.

.. _multi-spec-automationpasswordsecretref-optional:

``spec.security.authentication.agents.automationPasswordSecretRef.optional``
  *Type*: boolean

  Specifies whether these options are required or optional:

  - :ref:`spec.security.authentication.agents.automationPasswordSecretRef.key <multi-spec-automationpasswordsecretref-key>`

     ``false``. You can't configure authentication for this
     resource using the |com| user interface or APIs while this
     setting exists in the resource specification.

     Omit this setting if you want to manage authentication using the
     |com| user interface or APIs.

.. _multi-spec-security-agents-mode:

``spec.security.authentication.agents.mode``

     If you add this parameter to a |tls|\-enabled resource, |k8s|
     displays an error when the resource reaches the ``Pending`` state.
     This error displays: ``Please manually remove the |csr| in order
     to proceed.`` To remedy this issue:

     1. Remove any existing |csr|\s so that |k8s| can generate new
        |csr|\s. To learn how to delete a resource, see the
        :k8sdocs:`deleting resources
        </reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#deleting-resources>` in the
