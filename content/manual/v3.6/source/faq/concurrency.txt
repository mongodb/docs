MongoDB allows multiple clients to read and write the same data.
In order to ensure consistency, it uses locking and other
:term:`concurrency control` measures to prevent multiple clients
from modifying the same piece of data simultaneously.
Together, these mechanisms guarantee that all writes to a single
document occur either in full or not at all and that clients never
see an inconsistent view of the data.

What type of locking does MongoDB use?
--------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/lock-general.rst

In addition to a shared (S) locking mode for reads and an exclusive
(X) locking mode for write operations, intent shared (IS) and intent
exclusive (IX) modes indicate an intent to read or write a resource
using a finer granularity lock.  When locking at a certain granularity,
all higher levels are locked using an :term:`intent lock`.

For example, when locking a collection for writing (using mode X),
both the corresponding database lock and the global lock must be
locked in intent exclusive (IX) mode. A single database can
simultaneously be locked in IS and IX mode, but an exclusive (X)
lock cannot coexist with any other modes, and a shared (S) lock can
only coexists with intent shared (IS) locks.

Locks are fair, with reads and writes being queued in order. However,
to optimize throughput, when one request is granted, all other
compatible requests will be granted at the same time, potentially
releasing them before a conflicting request.  For example, consider
a case in which an X lock was just released, and in which the
conflict queue contains the following items:

IS |rarr| IS |rarr| X |rarr| X |rarr| S |rarr| IS

In strict first-in, first-out (FIFO) ordering, only the first two
IS modes would be granted. Instead MongoDB will actually grant all
IS and S modes, and once they all drain, it will grant X, even if
new IS or S requests have been queued in the meantime. As a grant
will always move all other requests ahead in the queue, no starvation
of any request is possible.

In :method:`db.serverStatus()` and :method:`db.currentOp()` output, the
lock modes are represented as follows:

How granular are locks in MongoDB?
----------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.0

For WiredTiger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beginning with version 3.0, MongoDB ships with the :ref:`WiredTiger
<storage-wiredtiger>` storage engine.

.. include:: /includes/fact-wiredtiger-locks.rst

For MMAPv1
~~~~~~~~~~

The MMAPv1 storage engine uses collection-level locking as of the
3.0 release series, an improvement on earlier versions in which the
database lock was the finest-grain lock. Third-party storage engines
may either use collection-level locking or implement their own
finer-grained concurrency control.

For example, if you have six collections in a database using the
MMAPv1 storage engine and an operation takes a collection-level write lock,
the other five collections are still available for read and write operations.
An exclusive database lock makes all six collections unavailable
for the duration of the operation holding the lock.

How do I see the status of locks on my :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

For reporting on lock utilization information on locks, use any of the
following methods:

- :method:`db.serverStatus()`,
- :method:`db.currentOp()`,
- :doc:`mongotop </reference/program/mongotop>`,
- :doc:`mongostat </reference/program/mongostat>`, and/or
- the |mms-home| or
  :products:`Ops Manager, an on-premise solution available in
  MongoDB Enterprise Advanced
  </mongodb-enterprise-advanced?jmp=docs>`

Specifically, the :serverstatus:`locks` document in the :doc:`output of
serverStatus </reference/command/serverStatus>`, or the :data:`~currentOp.locks` field
in the :doc:`current operation reporting </reference/method/db.currentOp>`
provides insight into the type of locks and amount of lock
contention in your :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance.

In :method:`db.serverStatus()` and :method:`db.currentOp()` output, the
lock modes are represented as follows:

.. include:: /includes/fact-lock-modes.rst

To terminate an operation, use :method:`db.killOp()`.

.. include:: /includes/replacement-mms.rst

.. _faq-concurrency-yielding:

Does a read or write operation ever yield the lock?
---------------------------------------------------

In some situations, read and write operations can yield their locks.

Long running read and write operations, such as queries, updates,
and deletes, yield under many conditions.  MongoDB operations can
also yield locks between individual document modifications in write
operations that affect multiple documents like
:method:`~db.collection.update()` with the ``multi`` parameter.

For storage engines supporting document level :term:`concurrency
control`, such as :doc:`WiredTiger </core/wiredtiger>`, yielding is not
necessary when accessing storage as the :term:`intent locks <intent
lock>`, held at the global, database and collection level, do not block
other readers and writers. However, operations will periodically yield,
such as:

- to avoid long-lived storage transactions because these can
  potentially require holding a large amount of data in memory;

- to serve as interruption points so that you can kill long running
  operations;

- to allow operations that require exclusive access to a collection
  such as index/collection drops and creations.

MongoDB's :ref:`MMAPv1 <storage-mmapv1>` storage engine uses
heuristics based on its access pattern to predict whether data is
likely in physical memory before performing a read. If MongoDB
*predicts* that the data is not in physical memory, an operation
will yield its lock while MongoDB loads the data into memory. Once
data is available in memory, the operation will reacquire the lock
to complete the operation.

Which administrative commands lock the database?
------------------------------------------------

Certain administrative commands can exclusively lock the database for
extended periods of time. In some deployments, for large databases,
you may consider taking the :binary:`~bin.mongod` instance offline so that
clients are not affected. For example, if a :binary:`~bin.mongod` is part
of a :term:`replica set`, take the :binary:`~bin.mongod` offline and let
other members of the set service load while maintenance is in progress.

The following administrative operations require an exclusive
lock at the database level for extended periods:

.. list-table::

   * - Commands
     - Methods

   * - :dbcommand:`cloneCollectionAsCapped`
     -

   * - :dbcommand:`compact`
     -

   * - :dbcommand:`convertToCapped`
     -

   * - :dbcommand:`copydb`. This operation may lock all databases. See
       :ref:`faq-concurrency-lock-multiple-dbs`.

     - :method:`db.copyDatabase()`. This operation may lock all
       databases. See :ref:`faq-concurrency-lock-multiple-dbs`.

   * - :dbcommand:`create` when creating a very large (i.e. many
       gigabytes) capped collection
     - :method:`db.createCollection()` when creating a very large (i.e.
       many gigabytes) capped collection

   * - :dbcommand:`createIndexes` for indexes *without* ``background``
       set to ``true``

     - :method:`db.collection.createIndex()` and
       :method:`db.collection.createIndexes()` issued *without*
       ``background`` set to ``true``

   * - :dbcommand:`reIndex`
     - :method:`db.collection.reIndex()`

   * - :dbcommand:`repairDatabase`
     - :method:`db.repairDatabase()`


The following administrative operations lock the database but only hold
the lock for a very short time:

.. list-table::

   * - Commands
     - Methods

   * - :dbcommand:`authenticate`

     - :method:`db.auth()`


   * - :dbcommand:`createUser`
     - :method:`db.createUser()`
   

   * - :dbcommand:`dropIndexes`
     - :method:`db.collection.dropIndex()`

   * - :dbcommand:`getLastError`
     - :method:`db.getLastError()`

   * - :dbcommand:`isMaster`
     - :method:`db.isMaster()`

   * - :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus`
     - :method:`rs.status()`


   * - :dbcommand:`renameCollection`
     - :method:`db.collection.renameCollection()`

   * - :dbcommand:`serverStatus`

     - :method:`db.serverStatus()`

.. _faq-concurrency-lock-multiple-dbs:

Does a MongoDB operation ever lock more than one database?
----------------------------------------------------------

The following MongoDB operations lock multiple databases:

- :method:`db.copyDatabase()` must lock the entire :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  instance at once.

- :method:`db.repairDatabase()` obtains a global write lock and will block
  other operations until it finishes.

- :doc:`User authentication </core/authentication>` requires a read
  lock on the ``admin`` database for deployments using :ref:`2.6 user
  credentials <admin-system-users-collection>`. For deployments using
  the 2.4 schema for user credentials, authentication locks the
  ``admin`` database as well as the database the user is accessing.

- All writes to a replica set's :term:`primary` lock both the database
  receiving the writes and then the ``local`` database for a short
  time. The lock for the ``local`` database allows the
  :binary:`~bin.mongod` to write to the primary's :term:`oplog` and
  accounts for a small portion of the total time of the operation.

- Replica set member :doc:`state transitions
  </reference/replica-states>` take global exlusive lock.

How does sharding affect concurrency?
-------------------------------------

:term:`Sharding <sharding>` improves concurrency by distributing
collections over multiple :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances, allowing shard
servers (i.e. :binary:`~bin.mongos` processes) to perform any number of
operations concurrently to the various downstream :binary:`~bin.mongod`
instances.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/lock-sharding.rst

.. _faq-concurrency-replication:

How does concurrency affect a replica set primary?
--------------------------------------------------

With replica sets, when MongoDB writes to a collection on the
:term:`primary`, MongoDB also writes to the primary's :term:`oplog`,
which is a special collection in the ``local`` database. Therefore,
MongoDB must lock both the collection's database and the ``local``
database. The :binary:`~bin.mongod` must lock both databases at the same
time to keep the database consistent and ensure that write operations,
even with replication, are "all-or-nothing" operations.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/lock-replica-set-primary.rst

How does concurrency affect secondaries?
----------------------------------------

In :term:`replication`, MongoDB does not apply writes serially to
:term:`secondaries <secondary>`. Secondaries collect oplog entries in
batches and then apply those batches in parallel. Secondaries do not
allow reads while applying the write operations, and apply write
operations in the order that they appear in the oplog.


Does MongoDB support transactions?
----------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-faq.rst

.. include:: /includes/extracts/transactions-usage.rst

.. note::

   .. include:: /includes/fact-upcoming.rst


What isolation guarantees does MongoDB provide?
-----------------------------------------------

Depending on the read concern, clients can see the results of writes
before the writes are :term:`durable`. To control whether the data read
may be rolled back or not, clients can use the ``readConcern`` option.
