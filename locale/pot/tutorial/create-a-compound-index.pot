msgid "Indexes allow MongoDB to process and fulfill queries quickly by creating small and efficient representations of the documents in a :term:`collection`. MongoDB supports indexes that include content on a single field, as well as :ref:`compound indexes <index-type-compound>` that include content from multiple fields. Continue reading for instructions and examples of building a compound index."
