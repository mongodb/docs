      * - Field
        - Contents

      * - :guilabel:`Name`

        - Type the name for the |s3| blockstore.

      * - :guilabel:`S3 Endpoint`
        - Type the |url| for an |aws| |s3| or |s3|-compatible bucket.

          .. note::

             MongoDB currently supports endpoints for:

             - |aws| |s3| :aws:`API
               </AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html>`,
             - IBM `Cloud Object Storage <https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/cloud-object-storage-s3-api-intro/>`_
               `API <https://ibm-public-cos.github.io/crs-docs/index.html>`__ and
             - Dell EMC `Elastic Cloud Storage <https://www.Dell EMC.com/en-us/storage/ecs/index.htm#collapse=>`_
               `API <https://www.emc.com/techpubs/ecs/ecs_s3_supported_features-1.htm>`__.

             IBM and Dell EMC support a subset of the full |aws| |s3|
             |api|.

      * - :guilabel:`Path Style Access`

        - Click if you want your |aws| |s3| or |s3|\-compatible bucket
          to use a path-style |url| endpoint
          (``s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>``) instead of a
          virtual-host-style |url| endpoint
          (``<bucket>.s3.amazonaws.com``).

          To review the |s3| bucket
          |url| conventions, see the
          :aws:`AWS S3 documentation </AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro>`

      * - :guilabel:`Server Side Encryption`

        - Click to enable :aws:`server-side encryption
          </AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html>`.
          Clear to disable server-side encryption.

      * - :guilabel:`AWS Access Key`

        - Type your |aws| Access Key ID.

      * - :guilabel:`AWS Secret Key`

        - Type your |aws| Secret Access Key.

          .. note:: The existing Secret Access Key is not displayed.

      * - :guilabel:`<hostname>:<port>`

        - Type in one or more hosts that comprise the |s3| blockstore
          metadata database in the ``<hostname:port>`` format.

          .. important::

             If these hosts are changed, the blockstore they host must
             have the same data as the original blockstore. Changing
             the host to a new blockstore results in data loss.

          - If the |s3| blockstore metadata database is a Replica Set
            or Sharded Cluster, type a comma-separated list of |mongod|
            instances (for a Replica Set) or |mongos| instances (for a
            Sharded Cluster).

            .. example::

               ``host1.example.com:27017, host2.example.com:27017, host2.example.com:27018``

          - If the |s3| blockstore metadata database is a standalone
            MongoDB instance, type the ``hostname:port`` of the
            instance.

          using the

          The credentials include the Username, Password, |aws| Access
          Key ID and |aws| Secret Key.

      * - :guilabel:`Use TLS/SSL`

        - Select if the blockstore database only accepts connection
          encrypted using |tls|.

          Beyond this checkbox, to connect this |s3| blockstore using
          |tls|, you must enable:

          - :manual:`TLS on the S3 blockstore database </tutorial/configure-ssl>`.

          - |onprem| to :ref:`use TLS <configure-ssl-backing>` to
            connect to this |s3| blockstore.

            .. note::

               All backing databases share the same |tls| certificates.
               If you have enabled |tls| for another backing database,
               you need only select this checkbox to enable a |tls|
               connection to this |s3| blockstore.

      * - :guilabel:`Connection Options`

        - Type any additional :manual:`configuration file options
          </reference/configuration-options>` for the MongoDB instance.
          This field supports unescaped values only.

          For proper syntax, see :manual:`Connection String URI
          Format </reference/connection-string>` in the MongoDB manual.

      * - :guilabel:`Assignment Labels` (Optional)

        - Type a comma-separated list of labels to assign the
          S3 blockstores to specific projects.

      * - :guilabel:`Load Factor` (Optional)

        - Type any positive integer that expresses how much backup work
          you want this snapshot store to perform compared to another
          snapshot store.

          .. important::
             If you have only one snapshot store, skip this setting.

          Backup work includes running backups, restoring snapshots or
          :term:`grooming <groom>` blockstores. The term of backup work
          ratio assigned to a single snapshot store is called its *Load
          Factor*.

          By default, |mms| assigns each snapshot store a
          :guilabel:`Load Factor` of ``1``. This means each snapshot
          store would perform the same amount of backup work.

          As a snapshot store's :guilabel:`Load Factor` increases, it
          performs more backup work compared to another snapshot store.
          If the :guilabel:`Load Factor` of snapshot store ``A`` is set
          to ``2`` and the :guilabel:`Load Factor` of snapshot store
          ``B`` is set to ``1``, ``A`` performs two times the backup
          work of ``B``.

          .. example:: **How to estimate Load Factor**

             Consider a five-shard sharded cluster with the
             following backup storage configuration:

             - File system store (``F``) manages the backup work for
               one shard in the cluster. ``F`` is running on a single
               two-core physical server.

             - Blockstore (``B``) manages the backup work for four
               shards in the cluster. ``B`` is running as a four-node
               sharded cluster on four physical servers with two cores
               on each server.

             In this example, ``B`` has four times the capability of
             ``F``. ``B`` should receive the greater part of the ratio
             of backup work: ``4:1``. For every one backup task ``F``
             performs, ``B`` performs ``4``.

             Set the Load Factors of ``B`` to ``4`` and ``F`` to ``1``.

          Snapshot stores with greater compute or storage performance
          should be given a greater :guilabel:`Load Factor`:

          - A file system store with 16-cores and 128 GB of RAM can
            back up more databases in less time than a file system
            store with only 2 cores and 8 GB of RAM.

          - A blockstore backed by a 10-node sharded cluster can back
            up more databases and groom more databases than a
            blockstore backed by a single replica set.

          :guilabel:`Load Factor` can be set to ``0``. When one
          snapshot store's :guilabel:`Load Factor` is set to ``0``, it
          performs no backup work at all. If a snapshot store's
          :guilabel:`Load Factor` is changed while backup work is in
          progress, all jobs or tasks running on that snapshot store
          are allowed to finish. All future backup work then is re-
          distributed among the remaining snapshot stores with a
          :guilabel:`Load Factor` of ``1`` or greater and have
          :guilabel:`Assignment Enabled` selected.


      * - :guilabel:`Write Concern`

        - Select your preferred :manual:`Write Concern</core/write-concern/>`:

          .. list-table::
             :widths: 30 70
             :stub-columns: 1

             * - Default
               - The write is not acknowledged.
             * - Journaled
               - A :term:`primary` or :term:`standalone` MongoDB instance
                 acknowledged the write and wrote that write to their on-disk
                 :term:`journals <journal>`.

                 .. note:: This is the default for standalone deployments.

             * - Acknowledged
               - A :term:`primary` or :term:`standalone` MongoDB instance
                 acknowledged the write.
             * - Replica Acknowledged
               - Two replica set members acknowledged the write.

                 .. note::
                    This is the default for replica sets or sharded clusters.

             * - Majority
               - A majority of the replica set members acknowledged the write.

   .. warning::

      Modifying the connection string values or the Write Concern for
      an existing blockstore requires all |onprem| components,
      including those only running the Backup Daemon, to be restarted
      to apply those changes. Connection parameters include:

      - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Username`
      - :guilabel:`MongoDB Auth Password`

      - :guilabel:`Write Concern`

      If you change to another blockstore host, the data on the
      existing blockstore is not copied automatically to the other
      blockstore.
