To access |a-mms| organization or the project within that organization,
|a-mms| user must be a member of that organization. Depending on the
user's :ref:`role in the organization <organization-roles>`, the |mms|
user may also need to be a member of the project to access a project.

|A-mms| user can be a member of multiple projects and multiple
organizations. If |a-mms| user is a member of a project, the user's
access to the project is determined their
:ref:`role in the project <project-roles>`.

Within an organization, you can group users into teams. Users can
belong to multiple teams. Teams can be assigned to multiple projects.
The team's :ref:`project role <project-roles>` sets the team members'
access to the project.

.. note::

   |mms| users are separate from :doc:`MongoDB users </tutorial/manage-mongodb-users>`.

Considerations
--------------

You can register with and login using your Google account or using your
email account.

Google Accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you register with your Google Account, the following differences
apply when using your Google account with |mms|:

- .. include:: /includes/facts/google-auth/account-details.rst

- .. include:: /includes/facts/google-auth/2fa.rst

- .. include:: /includes/facts/google-auth/change-account.rst

- .. include:: /includes/facts/google-auth/unlink-account.rst

|service| Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use |service|, use your |service| credentials to log in to
|mms|. You can then create a new |service| project from |mms|.

Add Users to |mms|
------------------

You must invite users to |mms| projects and organizations. The
following procedures result in an email invitation being sent to the
users you want to add. The users must accept your invitation to join
a project or an organization.

Users can create accounts using:

- The |mms|
  `account registration page <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/register>`_
  or
- `jira.mongodb.org <http://jira.mongodb.org/>`_.

.. note::

   If you create an account in |jira| or make any changes to that
   account from *within* |jira|, it can take up to 30 minutes for
   that change to propagate to |mms|. During this window you cannot
   add the user to a project in |mms|. Also, passwords changed in
   |jira| are subject to the same propagation delay for |mms|
   accounts.

- To invite a new user to a project, see :ref:`add-users-to-project`.
- To invite a new user to an organization, see
  :ref:`add-users-to-org`.
