MongoDB drivers use the following procedures to direct operations to
replica sets and sharded clusters. To determine how to route their
operations, applications periodically update their view of the replica
set's state, identifying which members are up or down, which member is
:term:`primary`, and verifying the latency to each :program:`mongod`
instance.

Member Selection
----------------

Clients, by way of their drivers, and :program:`mongos` instances for
sharded clusters, periodically update their view of the replica set's state.

When you select non-:readmode:`primary` read preference, the driver
will determine which member to target using the following process:

#. Assembles a list of suitable members, taking into account member type
   (i.e. secondary, primary, or all members).

#. Excludes members not matching the tag sets, if specified.

#. Determines which suitable member is the closest to the
   client in absolute terms.

#. Builds a list of members that are within a defined ping distance
   (in milliseconds) of the "absolute nearest"
   member.

   Applications can configure the threshold used in this stage. The
   default "acceptable latency" is 15 milliseconds, which you can
   override in the drivers with their own
   ``secondaryAcceptableLatencyMS`` option. For :program:`mongos` you
   can use the :option:`--localThreshold <mongos --localThreshold>` or
   :setting:`localThreshold` runtime options to set this value.

#. Selects a member from these hosts at random. The member receives
   the read operation.

Drivers can then associate the thread or connection with the selected member.
This :ref:`request association
<replica-set-read-preference-behavior-requests>` is configurable by
the application. See your :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>`
documentation about request association configuration and default
behavior.

Request Association
-------------------

.. important:: *Request association* is configurable by the
   application. See your :doc:`driver </applications/drivers>`
   documentation about request association configuration and default
   behavior.

Because :term:`secondary` members of a :term:`replica set` may lag
behind the current :term:`primary` by different amounts, reads for
:term:`secondary` members may reflect data at different points in time.
To prevent sequential reads from jumping around in time, the driver
**can** associate application threads to a specific member of the set
after the first read, thereby preventing reads from other members.
The thread will continue to read from the same member until:

- The application performs a read with a different read preference,

- The thread terminates, or

- The client receives a socket exception, as is the case when there's
  a network error or when the :program:`mongod` closes connections
  during a :term:`failover`.  This triggers a :ref:`retry
  <replica-set-read-preference-behavior-retry>`, which may be
  transparent to the application.

When using request association, if the client detects that the set has
elected a new :term:`primary`, the driver will discard all associations
between threads and members.

.. _replica-set-read-preference-behavior-retry:

Auto-Retry
----------

Connections between MongoDB drivers and :program:`mongod` instances in
a :term:`replica set` must balance two concerns:

#. The client should attempt to prefer current results, and any
   connection should read from the same member of the replica set as
   much as possible.

#. The client should minimize the amount of time that the database is
   inaccessible as the result of a connection issue, networking
   problem, or :term:`failover` in a replica set.

As a result, MongoDB drivers and :program:`mongos`:

- Reuse a connection to specific :program:`mongod` for as long as
  possible after establishing a connection to that instance. This
  connection is *pinned* to this :program:`mongod`.

- Attempt to reconnect to a new member, obeying existing :ref:`read
  preference modes <replica-set-read-preference-modes>`, if the connection
  to :program:`mongod` is lost.

  Reconnections are transparent to the application itself. If
  the connection permits reads from :term:`secondary` members, after
  reconnecting, the application can receive two sequential reads
  returning from different secondaries. Depending on the state of the
  individual secondary member's replication, the documents can reflect
  the state of your database at different moments.

- Return an error *only* after attempting to connect to three members
  of the set that match the :ref:`read preference mode
  <replica-set-read-preference-modes>` and :ref:`tag set
  <replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`.  If there are fewer than
  three members of the set, the client will error after connecting to
  all existing members of the set.

  After this error, the driver selects a new member using the
  specified read preference mode. In the absence of a specified read
  preference, the driver uses :readmode:`primary`.

- After detecting a failover situation, [#fn-failover]_ the driver
  attempts to refresh the state of the replica set as quickly as
  possible.

.. [#fn-failover] When a :term:`failover` occurs, all members of the set
   close all client connections that produce a socket error in the
   driver. This behavior prevents or minimizes :term:`rollback`.

Read Preference in Sharded Clusters
-----------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 2.2
   Before version 2.2, :program:`mongos` did not support the
   :ref:`read preference mode semantics <replica-set-read-preference-modes>`.

In most :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`, each shard consists of a :term:`replica
set`. As such, read preferences are also applicable.
With regard to read preference, read operations in a sharded cluster
are identical to unsharded replica sets.

Unlike simple replica sets, in sharded clusters, all interactions with
the shards pass from the clients to the :program:`mongos` instances
that are actually connected to the set members. :program:`mongos` is then
responsible for the application of read preferences, which is
transparent to applications.

There are no configuration changes required for full support of read
preference modes in sharded environments, as long as the
:program:`mongos` is at least version 2.2. All :program:`mongos`
maintain their own connection pool to the replica set members. As a
result:

- A request without a specified preference has
  :readmode:`primary`, the default, unless, the :program:`mongos`
  reuses an existing connection that has a different mode set.

  To prevent confusion, always explicitly set your read preference mode.

- All :readmode:`nearest` and latency calculations reflect the
  connection between the :program:`mongos` and the :program:`mongod`
  instances, not the client and the :program:`mongod` instances.

  This produces the desired result, because all results must pass
  through the :program:`mongos` before returning to the client.
