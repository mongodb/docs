A *task* is an action that users perform to achieve a goal, such as
creating a server. A task topic, article, or section provides the
action steps and the necessary context and reference information that
the user needs to complete the task.

This topic provides guidelines for developing tasks.

Task Titles
-----------

The title of a task topic, article, or section begins with the
imperative form of the task action, and it uniquely, precisely, and
clearly describes the task. Use a plural subject unless the singular
makes more sense or is necessary for clarity.

.. example::

   - Create users in SQL Server
   - Configure SQL Server Management Studio to connect to SQL Server on
     Windows
   - Add new ServiceNet routes to a server

For guidelines about capitalizing titles, see
:ref:`titles-and-headings`.

Task Page Structure
-------------------

Task Introductions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before providing steps, set the context for the task as necessary. For
example, you could state the reason for completing the task, the method
to be used, and the expected result. You might also state the intended
audience and suggest the amount of time that the task might take,
especially if it will take a long time.

.. note::

  - If the article or section title provides sufficient context, you
    can omit an introduction.
  - Avoid providing extensive overview or conceptual text in the
    introduction to a task. Provide that information in a separate
    informational topic or in a topic that introduces the task as part
    of a larger process or user goal.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the task has requirements that the user *must* meet before taking
action, describe them in a "Prerequisites" section that precedes the
steps. You could include the following information:

-  A hyperlink to a preceding task, if that task must be performed
   before this task
-  Software that must already be installed, accessible, or running
-  Access rights that are required for users to perform the task
-  Hyperlinks to other topics that contain requirements or prerequisite
   tasks that the user must perform

.. note::

   Avoid including detailed procedures in a prerequisites section.
   Provide prerequisite tasks in other articles or sections, which you
   can reference in this section.

Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~

A task contains one or more *procedures*, or set of sequential action
steps. Consider the following guidelines when creating a procedure:

-  If the procedure has more than one step, use a numbered list for the
   steps. Don't use bullets, except to list choices within a step.
-  If the procedure has only one step, show that step in a regular
   paragraph. That is, don't number it.
-  If you have lengthy introductory or prerequisite information, or if
   you have more than one procedure, provide a heading for the
   procedure or procedures. Use the imperative form of the action and a
   singular form of the object. Don't repeat the title of the task
   article.
-  Try to limit procedures to 10 steps. If you have more than 10 steps,
   consider whether you can divide the steps into two or more
   procedures. Creating several short, simple, and sequential
   procedures instead on one long, complex procedure, especially one
   with many substeps and choice steps, will help users know where they
   are in the process, judge their progress, and complete the task
   successfully.

Steps
~~~~~

When writing steps, use the following guidelines.

.. contents:: In this section
   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecol


Use Imperative Sentences
````````````````````````

Write each step as a complete and correctly punctuated imperative
sentence (that is, a sentence that starts with an imperative verb). In
steps, the focus is on the user, and the voice is active.

.. example::

   #. Log in to the Cloud Control Panel.

   #. Use the following command to start ``vsftpd``:

      .. code-block:: sh

         sudo service vsftpd start

Show One Action Per Step
````````````````````````

Usually, include only a single action in each step. If two actions are
closely related, such as opening a menu and selecting a command from
the menu, you can include both actions in one step.

.. example::

   #. Under **Export**, select your database (for example,
      388488\_drupal).

   #. Scroll down to the bottom of the window and select the **Save as
      file** check box, which will save your database output to a file.

   #. Click **Go**.

   #. If you're prompted to save your file, save it to your computer.

Provide context before the action
`````````````````````````````````

If a step specifies where to perform an action, state where to perform
the action before describing the action.

.. example::

   #. In the navigation pane, click **Inbound Rules**.

   #. On the Binding and SSL Settings page, perform the following
      steps:

Provide conditions before actions
`````````````````````````````````

If a step specifies a situation or a condition, state the situation or
condition before describing the action.

.. example::

   #. If a new version is available, click **Install**.

   #. To find out the encryption type of your Windows computer (32-bit
      or 64-bit), navigate to the server's Control Panel and click
      **System**.

Follow the Step with Explanatory Information
````````````````````````````````````````````

Don't include explanatory or reference information in the action part
of a step. If needed, follow the step with one or more paragraphs that
provide supplemental information.

.. example::

   #. In the **Body Match** text box, enter a word or phrase that will
      appear on the page when it loads successfully.

      For example, you can perform a body match on the copyright date
      to verify whether the website is running.

Show Only Actions as Steps
``````````````````````````

Don't show system actions, responses, or results as steps. Put
necessary statements in unnumbered paragraphs following the steps to
which they apply. See the first example in the "Examples" section.

When the result of a step is the appearance of a dialog box, window, or
page in which the action of the next steps occurs, you can usually
eliminate a result statement and orient the user at the beginning of
the next step. See the second example in the "Examples" section.

.. example::

   *Use:*

   #. On Linux, enter the following command:

      .. code-block:: sh

         sudo MongoDB-monitoring-agent --setup

      The list of setup settings is displayed.

   *Use:*

   #. Under **Other Options** in the MongoDB Email box, select
      **Mobile Sync**.

   #. On the Activate Mobile Sync page, select individual
      users to activate, or select the **Add Mobile Sync to all
      mailboxes on this domain** option.

Use Screenshots Sparingly
`````````````````````````

Screenshots can help to orient the user, but a screenshot of every
field or dialog box usually isn't necessary.

If you include screenshots, place each one directly under the step that
it illustrates. Don't rely on the screenshot to show information or
values that the user must enter; always provide that information in the
text of the steps. However, ensure that the screenshot accurately
reflects the directions and values in the step text.

To learn more about when to use screenshots, see
:ref:`screenshot-guidelines`.

Label Optional Steps
````````````````````

To indicate that a step is optional, include *(Optional)*, in italics,
as a qualifier at the beginning of the step.

.. example::

   #. *(Optional)* Click **Advanced Options**.

Omit Extraneous Words
`````````````````````

Omit extraneous words (such as *pop-up menu* or *command button*)
unless they're needed for clarity.

.. example::

   *Use:*

   #. In the Disks window, right-click the volume and select **Take
      Offline**.

   *Avoid:*

   #. In the Disks window, right-click the volume and select **Take
      Offline** from the pop-up menu.

   *Use:*

   #. Click **Add**, enter a name for the profile, and then click
      **OK**.

   *Avoid:*

   #. Click the **Add** button, enter a name for the profile in the
      text box, and then click the **OK** button.

Show Multiple Possibilities in a List
`````````````````````````````````````

If a step directs the user to choose from multiple possibilities,
use an unordered list to present the possibilities.

.. example::

   #. Select a volume type:

      -  **Standard**: A standard SATA drive for users who need
         additional storage on their server
      -  **High Performance**: An SSD drive, which offers a higher
         performance option for databases and high performance
         applications

Document only One Method
````````````````````````

If more than one method exists for completing an action, document only
one method, usually the most efficient or preferred method.

.. example::

   *Use:*

   #. Select **File > New**.

   *Don't use:*

   #. Select **File > New**, or press **Ctrl+N**.

Results, Verification, Examples, and Troubleshooting
----------------------------------------------------

Following the procedure or procedures, include the following
information if it's necessary or helpful to the user. If the
information is brief, you can include it directly following the last
step in the procedure. If it's lengthy or you need to provide more than
one type of information, use sections with headings.

-  The result of performing the task.
-  Information about verifying successful completion of the task, such
   as the location of logs. If verification is a separate task in a
   different article or section, provide a hyperlink to it under a
   "Where to go from here" heading.
-  An example that illustrates or supports the task.
-  Information about what to do if the procedure doesn't work. This
   information might be a hyperlink to a separate troubleshooting
   topic.

Direction to the Next Action
----------------------------

If your task is part of a larger set of tasks, you can help the user
by including a "Where to go from here" section. You might include the
following information:

-  A brief explanation of the next task and why the user needs to
   perform it, accompanied by a hyperlink to the next task.
-  Hyperlinks to other tasks that could be done next, if multiple
   options are available. Describe the multiple options so that
   users know which task to choose.

Related Topics
--------------

To provide a quick way for the user to access other content that's
related to the task, provide links to the content at the end of the
article or topic. Even if you have already included an embedded
hyperlink to the material in the article or topic, you can provide the
hyperlink again under "Related topics," but typically you should
provide a link only once in an article or section. For more information
about linking, see :ref:`links-and-cross-references`.
