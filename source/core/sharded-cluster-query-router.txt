Sharded Cluster Query Routing
=============================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB :program:`mongos` instances route queries and write operations
to :term:`shards <shard>` in a sharded cluster. :program:`mongos` provide the
only interface to a sharded cluster from the perspective of
applications. Applications never connect or communicate directly with
the shards.

The :program:`mongos` tracks what data is on which shard by caching
the metadata from the :ref:`config servers
<sharded-cluster-config-server>`. The :program:`mongos` uses the
metadata to route operations from applications and clients to the
:program:`mongod` instances. A :program:`mongos` has no *persistent*
state and consumes minimal system resources.

The most common practice is to run :program:`mongos` instances on the
same systems as your application servers, but you can maintain
:program:`mongos` instances on the shards or on other dedicated
resources.

.. note::

   .. versionchanged:: 2.1

   Some aggregation operations using the :dbcommand:`aggregate`
   command (i.e. :method:`db.collection.aggregate()`) will cause
   :program:`mongos` instances to require more CPU resources than in
   previous versions. This modified performance profile may dictate
   alternate architecture decisions if you use the :term:`aggregation
   framework` extensively in a sharded environment.

Routing Process
---------------

A :program:`mongos` instance uses the following processes to route
queries and return results.

How ``mongos`` Determines which Shards Receive a Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :program:`mongos` instance routes a query to a :term:`cluster <sharded
cluster>` by:

1. Determining the list of :term:`shards <shard>` that must receive the
   query.

#. Establishing a cursor on all targeted shards.

In some cases, when the :term:`shard key` or a prefix of the shard
key is a part of the query, the :program:`mongos` can route the
query to a subset of the shards. Otherwise, the :program:`mongos`
must direct the query to *all* shards that hold documents for that
collection.

.. example::

   Given the following shard key:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { zipcode: 1, u_id: 1, c_date: 1 }

   Depending on the distribution of chunks in the cluster, the
   :program:`mongos` may be able to target the query at a subset of
   shards, if the query contains the following fields:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { zipcode: 1 }
      { zipcode: 1, u_id: 1 }
      { zipcode: 1, u_id: 1, c_date: 1 }

How ``mongos`` Handles Query Modifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the result of the query is not sorted, the :program:`mongos`
instance opens a result cursor that "round robins" results from all
cursors on the shards.

.. versionchanged:: 2.0.5
   In versions prior to 2.0.5, the :program:`mongos` exhausted each
   cursor, one by one.

If the query specifies sorted results using the
:method:`~cursor.sort()` cursor method, the :program:`mongos` instance
passes the :operator:`$orderby` option to the shards. When the
:program:`mongos` receives results it performs an incremental *merge sort* 
of the results while returning them to the client.

If the query limits the size of the result set using the
:method:`~cursor.limit()` cursor method, the :program:`mongos`
instance passes that limit to the shards and then re-applies the limit
to the result before returning the result to the client.

If the query specifies a number of records to *skip* using the
:method:`~cursor.skip()` cursor method, the :program:`mongos` *cannot*
pass the skip to the shards, but rather retrieves unskipped results
from the shards and skips the appropriate number of documents when assembling
the complete result. However, when used in conjunction with a
:method:`~cursor.limit()`, the :program:`mongos` will pass the *limit*
plus the value of the :method:`~cursor.skip()` to the shards to
improve the efficiency of these operations.

Detect Connections to :program:`mongos` Instances
-------------------------------------------------

To detect if the MongoDB instance that your client is connected
to is :program:`mongos`, use the :dbcommand:`isMaster` command. When a
client connects to a :program:`mongos`, :dbcommand:`isMaster` returns
a document with a ``msg`` field that holds the string
``isdbgrid``. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "ismaster" : true,
      "msg" : "isdbgrid",
      "maxBsonObjectSize" : 16777216,
      "ok" : 1
   }

If the application is instead connected to a :program:`mongod`, the
returned document does not include the ``isdbgrid`` string.

Broadcast Operations and Targeted Operations
--------------------------------------------

In general, operations in a sharded environment are either:

- Broadcast to all shards in the cluster that hold documents in a
  collection

- Targeted at a single shard or a limited group of shards, based on
  the shard key

For best performance, use targeted operations whenever possible. While
some operations must broadcast to all shards, you can ensure MongoDB
uses targeted operations whenever possible by always including the shard
key.

Broadcast Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:program:`mongos` instances broadcast queries to all shards for the
collection **unless** the :program:`mongos` can
determine which shard or subset of shards stores this data.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-scatter-gather-query.rst

Multi-update operations are always broadcast operations.

The :method:`~db.collection.remove()` operation is always a
broadcast operation, unless the operation specifies the shard key in
full.

Targeted Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All :method:`~db.collection.insert()` operations target to one
shard.

All single :method:`~db.collection.update()` (including :term:`upsert`
operations) and :method:`~db.collection.remove()` operations must
target to one shard.

.. important:: .. include:: /includes/fact-single-modification-in-sharded-collections.rst

For queries that include the shard key or portion of the shard key,
:program:`mongos` can target the query at a specific shard or set of
shards. This is the case only if the portion of the shard key included
in the query is a *prefix* of the shard key. For example, if the shard
key is:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 }

The :program:`mongos` program *can* route queries that include the full
shard key or either of the following shard key prefixes at a
specific shard or set of shards:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { a: 1 }
   { a: 1, b: 1 }

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-targeted-query.rst

Depending on the distribution of data in the cluster and the
selectivity of the query, :program:`mongos` may still have to
contact multiple shards [#possible-all]_ to fulfill these queries.

.. [#possible-all] :program:`mongos` will route some queries, even
   some that include the shard key, to all shards, if needed.

Sharded and Non-Sharded Data
----------------------------

Sharding operates on the collection level. You can shard multiple
collections within a database or have multiple databases with
sharding enabled. [#sharding-databases]_ However, in production
deployments, some databases and collections will use sharding, while
other databases and collections will only reside on a single
shard.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-primary-shard.rst

Regardless of the data architecture of your :term:`sharded cluster`,
ensure that all queries and operations use the :term:`mongos` router to
access the data cluster. Use the :program:`mongos` even for operations
that do not impact the sharded data.

.. include:: /images/sharded-cluster-mixed.rst

.. [#sharding-databases] As you configure sharding, you will use the
   :dbcommand:`enableSharding` command to enable sharding for a
   database. This simply makes it possible to use the
   :dbcommand:`shardCollection` command on a collection within that database.
