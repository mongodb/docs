`Full release notes available on JIRA 
<https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=17381&version=38287>`__.

v2.2.0
------

*Released March 11, 2024*

.. warning::
   This release is affected by a bug, fixed in 2.2.1, where ``require('<module>')`` 
   caused an error in script mode.

Performance improvements:

- :issue:`MONGOSH-1605` – ``mongosh`` uses Node.js startup 
  snapshots again to improve initialization performance.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-1721` – ``mongosh`` now defaults to ``--quiet`` in 
  non-interactive mode. For example, using ``--json`` or loading files 
  from the command line without also specifying ``--shell``. Users who 
  do not want this behavior need to specify ``--no-quiet``.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-1720` – Script execution in non-interactive mode becomes 
  significantly faster by replacing the underlying evaluation mechanism.

Node.js:

- ``mongosh`` now uses version 6.5.0 of the :driver:`Node.js driver </node/>`.

- :issue:`NODE-5981` – Improved compliance for the Node.js driver. ``mongosh`` 
  enters ``directConnection=true`` by default when only a single host/port 
  is given on the command line. This ignores ``readPreference`` options 
  and consistently applies a ``primaryPreferred`` read preference, even 
  if a read preference is specified on the connection string or on the 
  individual command.

OIDC functionality:

- :issue:`COMPASS-7437` – ``mongosh`` will not request default OIDC scopes 
  that are not supported by the Identity Provider.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-1712` – The ``--tlsUseSystemCA`` flag now also applies 
  to HTTP requests made to the Identity Provider, to better accommodate 
  customers behind TLS-terminating firewalls.

Issues fixed:

- :issue:`MONGOSH-1667` – ``passwordPrompt()`` works as originally intended.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-1702` – No more flaky deprecation warnings showing up for 
  macOS homebrew users.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-1617` – Piping scripts into ``mongosh`` together with 
  custom prompts from your ``.mongoshrc.js`` works consistently now.

------

  option.

  version conflict on RHEL8 distros 
- :issue:`MONGOSH-1651` - Sample sessions sent to telemetry

v2.1.0
------

*Released November 21, 2023*

- :issue:`MONGOSH-1621` and :issue:`NODE-5709` – Homebrew users who were automatically upgraded  
  to Node.js 21 stop seeing deprecation warnings. 

- :issue:`MONGOSH-1452` and :issue:`NODE-5040` – ``mongosh`` now displays BSON objects in a format 
  that is more consistent with other ``mongosh`` output. Also, many BSON objects now support syntax 
  highlighting.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-1527` – You can now iterate mongosh cursors with idiomatic 
  syntax: ``for (const doc of db.coll.find()) { }``. Previously, ``mongosh`` only supported ``.forEach`` 
  syntax for iteration.

  `CVE-2023-45133 <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45133>`__.
- `CVE-2023-45143 <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45143>`__  
  affects the ``fetch()`` API that is available in ``mongosh`` 2.x.

  ``binaryValue:Binary.createFromBase64( "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQhCg==" )``

  For additional details, see :method:`Binary.createFromBase64()`.

<https://jira.mongodb.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=17381&version=34315>`__.

v1.5.4
------

*Released July 31, 2022*

Fixes a potential data corruption bug in
:method:`KeyVault.rewrapManyDataKey()` when rotating encrypted data
encryption keys backed by Azure or GCP key services.

In previous versions of ``mongosh``, this bug occurs when an
Azure-backed or GCP-backed data encryption key being rewrapped requires
fetching an access token for decryption of the data encryption key.

As a result of this bug, all data encryption keys being rewrapped are
replaced by new randomly generated material, destroying the original key
material.

To mitigate potential data corruption, upgrade ``mongosh`` to v1.5.4 or
higher before using :method:`KeyVault.rewrapManyDataKey()` to rotate
Azure-backed or GCP-backed data encryption keys. You should always
create a backup of the key vault collection before key rotation.

v1.5.3
------

*Released July 29, 2022*

     ``config`` settings persist across sessions.

- On Windows,  you can start ``mongosh`` by double-clicking on the
  ``.exe`` file. When you do, ``mongosh`` prompts you for a connection
  string to connect to your deployment.

  newline-delimited JSON with the same set of fields used by the server.

v1.0
----

*Released July 9, 2021*

  displays ``Atlas`` instead of ``Enterprise``.

Behavior Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever a command's output includes ``{ ok: 0 }``, ``mongosh`` throws
an exception and does not return the raw output from the server.

The legacy ``mongo`` shell error handling is not consistent between
commands. ``mongosh`` standardizes the user-facing behavior for a
more consistent experience.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- :issue:`MONGOSH-323 <MONGOSH-323>`: getUser() userId field is
  outputted as binary.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-337 <MONGOSH-337>`: Linux tarball is not gzipped.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-341 <MONGOSH-341>`: Wrong values with NumberLong for
  numbers > Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. As a result of this fix, values
  passed to ``NumberLong`` and ``NumberDecimal`` must be strings.

  .. important::

     The fix for :issue:`MONGOSH-341 <MONGOSH-341>` is a breaking
     change when compared to behavior in the legacy ``mongo`` shell.

- :issue:`MONGOSH-346 <MONGOSH-346>`: ``Ctrl+C`` does not terminate the
  currently running command in the shell.

  .. note::

     ``Ctrl+C`` terminates the process in the shell, but does not
     terminate the process on the MongoDB server.
