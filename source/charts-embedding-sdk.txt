You can embed a chart into a web application with the :ref:`Embedding
SDK <embedding-charts-sdk>`, which allows you to make more flexible 
adjustments to chart settings and rendering.

You can use the embedding SDK to do the following tasks:

- Add filters dynamically
- Change the size and style of the chart
- Refresh on demand
- Programmatically save charts as an image

To embed a chart with the SDK, you need to:

1. Enable embedding for the chart.
#. Allow :ref:`embedded chart filtering <embed-options-filter>` on 
   certain fields by :ref:`specifying filterable fields 
   <specify-filter-fields>`. Don't include fields that may reveal 
   sensitive data. 
#. Have the chart ID and base URL strings.
