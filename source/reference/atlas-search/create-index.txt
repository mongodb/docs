Prerequisites
-------------

To create an |fts| index, you must have an Atlas cluster with:

- MongoDB version ``4.2`` or higher
- At least one collection

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/create-fts-index.rst

.. _node-status-ref:

Node Status
-----------

The |fts| Indexes tab in the right-side panel of the |service| UI 
displays information about |fts| indexes for the selected namespace. 
The :guilabel:`Status` column shows the current state of the index
on the primary node of the cluster. Click the :guilabel:`View 
status details` link below the status to view the state of the index 
on all the nodes of the cluster.

When the :guilabel:`Status` column reads :guilabel:`Active`, the index
is ready to use. In other states, queries against the index may return
incomplete results.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status
     - Description

   * - Not Started 
     - Indicates |service| has not yet started building the index.

   * - Initial Sync 
     - Indicates the index is building or re-building after an edit. 
       In this state, |fts| will not serve queries.

   * - Active
     - Indicates the index is ready to use.

   * - Failed 
     - Indicates |service| could not build the index. Use the error  
       in the :guilabel:`View status details` modal window to 
       troubleshoot the issue.

   * - Delete in Progress
     - Indicates |service| is deleting the index from the cluster nodes.

When the index is building and after it is built, the :guilabel:`Documents` 
column shows the percentage and number of documents indexed. The column also 
shows the total number of documents in the collection.
