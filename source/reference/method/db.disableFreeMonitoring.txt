.. method:: db.disableFreeMonitoring()

   .. versionadded:: 4.0

   Disables :doc:`free Cloud monitoring </administration/free-monitoring>`.

   .. important::

      To run :method:`db.disableFreeMonitoring()`, you must have
      specified :option:`--enableFreeMonitoring <mongod
      --enableFreeMonitoring>` command-line option or
      :setting:`cloud.monitoring.free.state` configuration file set to
      ``runtime``.

      Otherwise, you can only enable or disable at startup. See
      :option:`--enableFreeMonitoring <mongod --enableFreeMonitoring>`
      command-line option or :setting:`cloud.monitoring.free.state` for
      details.

   The :method:`db.disableFreeMonitoring()` method is a wrapper around
   the :dbcommand:`setFreeMonitoring` command.

Access Control
--------------

When running with access control, the user must have the
:authaction:`setFreeMonitoring` privilege actions on the :ref:`cluster
<resource-document>`. That is, a user must have a :ref:`role <roles>`
that grants the following :ref:`privilege <privileges>`:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { resource: { cluster : true }, actions: [ "setFreeMonitoring" ] }

The built-in role :authrole:`clusterMonitor` role provides this
privilege.


Example
-------

To disable free monitoring, run the following from the
:binary:`~bin.mongo` shell:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.disableFreeMonitoring()

You can use :method:`db.getFreeMonitoringStatus()` to check your of
free monitoring status:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.getFreeMonitoringStatus()

If free monitoring is disabled, the method returns a document similar to:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "state" : "disabled",
      "message" : "To see your monitoring data, navigate to the unique URL below.\nAnyone you share the URL with will also be able to view this page.\n\nhttps://cloud.mongodb.com/freemonitoring/mongo/MSBjZTZhNTJmOS0yODg1\n\nYou can disable monitoring at any time by running db.disableFreeMonitoring().",
      "url" : "https://cloud.mongodb.com/freemonitoring/mongo/MSBjZTZhNTJmOS0yODg1",
      "userReminder" : "",
      "ok" : 1
   }

Even when disabled, your unique URL is returned so that if you
re-enable monitoring at a later time, you can access your previous
metrics that has not expired within the past 24 hours.
