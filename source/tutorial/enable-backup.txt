====================
Back up a Deployment
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can back up a sharded cluster or replica set. To back up a
standalone :program:`mongod` process, you must first :manual:`convert it to a
single-member replica set </tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set>`. You can
choose to back up all databases and collections on the deployment or
specific ones.

Prerequisites
-------------

- |mms| must be monitoring the deployment. For a sharded cluster, |mms| must
  also be monitoring at least one :program:`mongos` in the cluster.

- A replica set must be MongoDB version 2.2.0 or later.

- A sharded-cluster must be MongoDB version 2.4.3 or later.

- Each replica set must have an active :term:`primary`.

- For a sharded cluster, all :term:`config servers <config server>` must be
  running and the balancing round must have completed within the last hour.

- If you explicitly select a sync target, ensure that the sync target is
  accessible on the network and keeping up with replication.

Procedure
---------

Before using this procedure, see the
:doc:`/core/backup-preparations` to decide how to back up the data
and what data to back up.
