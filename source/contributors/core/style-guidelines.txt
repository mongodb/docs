This page presents some coding style and general guidelines that you
should strive to follow when contributing code.

Consistency
-----------

The **most important** guideline is to be consistent with the existing
style in the files. This rule applies to all projects and overrides the
actual style guide on most occasions. For example, follow the spacing
or naming conventions in the file you are editing.

.. tip:: If your IDE has auto-formatting, turn off the feature.

Rules of Thumb for Contributing Code
------------------------------------

- Add tests for your new functionality.

- Ensure your code is readable.

  Readability helps the project maintainers and other contributors
  understand your code. This includes commenting your code. See
  :ref:`guidelines-comments`.
  
- Maintain backwards compatibility.

  - Avoid changes that break the project's functionality and cause
    existing tests to fail unexpectedly.

  - Avoid changes that affect the project's compatibility with other
    projects. For example, each driver has to be compatible with many
    versions of the associated language.

- Ensure cross-platform compatibility.

  We recognize that you may not be able to test your changes across
  different operating system. Just be aware that we do test for
  cross-platform compatibility and failing the tests could be a reason
  for not accepting your pull requests.

General Guidelines for Commenting Code
--------------------------------------

- Use complete sentences with proper capitalization and punctuation.

- Use declarative comments instead of imperatives; i.e. comments
  should state what the function does.

  For example, if a function computes the product of two numbers, the
  comment should state: 

  .. code-block:: none

     This function computes the product of two floats.

  Avoid using the imperative ``Compute the product of two floats.``

- Every module, class, method, type, or global variable should have a
  one-line comment of its functionality. A method should have a
  one-line description of what it does, including its input and output.

  Basically, the usage for a class should be apparent from reading the
  header.

- Use in-line comments to describe "how" the code works if not
  self-evident. For example, if the order of the commands is important
  for some reason that is unclear, put a comment. Or, if the code works
  in a way different from what a casual reader would expect, put a
  comment.

.. note:: If a driver has a different convention for commenting, follow
   the specific convention for the driver.
