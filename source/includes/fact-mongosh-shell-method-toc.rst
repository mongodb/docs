The methods listed on this table of contents page are
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` methods.  This is *not* the documentation for
``Node.js`` or other programming language specific driver methods.

In most cases, :binary:`~bin.mongosh` methods work the same way as the
legacy :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell methods. However, some legacy methods
are unavailable in ``mongosh``.

For the legacy :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell documentation, refer to the
documentation for the corresponding MongoDB Server release:

- :v4.4:`mongo shell v4.4 </mongo>`
- :v4.2:`mongo shell v4.2 </mongo>`
- :v4.0:`mongo shell v4.0 </mongo>`

For MongoDB API drivers, refer to the language specific
:driver:`MongoDB driver </>` documentation.
