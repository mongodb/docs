.. _k8s-openshift-versions:

|k8s| and OpenShift Versions
----------------------------

The |k8s-op-short| is compatible with the following |k8s| and OpenShift
versions. Unless otherwise noted, each |k8s-op-short| version listed
spans the full release series starting from the listed version.

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/compatibility-k8s-os.rst

.. _k8s-naming-conventions:

Supported |k8s| Cluster Naming Conventions
------------------------------------------

The |k8s-op-short| supports only |k8s| cluster names that consist of 
alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and periods. 

If your cluster name contains unsupported characters, you must `rename your cluster <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_config/kubectl_config_rename-context/>`__ 
to a supported name. For example, if you are deploying the |k8s-op-short| in an |aws| 
`EKS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/clusters.html>`__ cluster, you must rename the 
cluster as the default name contains unsupported characters.

.. _k8s-cncf-compatibility:

Other Distributions of |k8s|
----------------------------

The |k8s-op-short| is also compatible with all
`CNCF-certified distributions <https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/>`__
of |k8s| and core |k8s| features. The distribution version 
must match one of the base |k8s| versions supported by the |k8s-op-short|.

To learn which |k8s| versions are supported by your |k8s-op-short| series,
see the preceding :ref:`OpenShift versions table <k8s-openshift-versions>`.

.. _k8s-mdb-version-compatibility:

Supported Platforms and MongoDB Versions
----------------------------------------

The |k8s-op-short| is compatible with different versions of MongoDB
depending on the base image of the MongoDB database resource.

The |k8s-op-short| is compatible with actively supported versions of
MongoDB.

The |k8s-op-short| isn't compatible with MongoDB versions that
have reached end of life, or that are listed on the `MongoDB Alerts
<https://www.mongodb.com/alerts>`_ page. To learn more about
which MongoDB versions your base image supports, see
:manual:`Platform Support
</administration/production-notes/#std-label-prod-notes-supported-platforms>`
in the MongoDB Manual.

Unless otherwise noted, each |k8s-op-short| version listed spans the
full release series starting from the listed version.
