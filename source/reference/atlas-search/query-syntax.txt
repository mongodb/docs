   Looking for ``$searchBeta``? Use ``$search`` instead, the official 
   aggregation stage for running search queries. 

Definition
----------

.. pipeline:: $search

   |fts| queries take the form of an
   :manual:`aggregation pipeline stage </aggregation>`. The
   :pipeline:`$search` stage performs a full-text search on the
   specified field or fields which must be covered by an |fts| index.

   A ``$search`` pipeline stage has the following prototype form:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        $search: {
          <operator>: {
            <specification(s)>
          }
        }
      }

Behavior
--------

``$search`` must be the first stage of any pipeline it appears in.
``$search`` cannot be used in:

- a :manual:`view definition</core/views>`
- a :pipeline:`$lookup subpipeline <$lookup>`
- a :pipeline:`$facet` pipeline stage
