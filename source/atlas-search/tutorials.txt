You can learn how to set up and query an |fts| index with our
use-case :ref:`tutorials <fts-tutorials-section>` 
or :ref:`video <fts-video-section>`.

.. You can learn how to set up and query an |fts| index with our
.. :ref:`interactive lab <fts-lab-section>`, 
.. use-case :ref:`tutorials <fts-tutorials-section>` 
.. or :ref:`video <fts-video-section>`.

.. .. _fts-lab-section:

.. Learn with an Interactive Lab
.. -----------------------------

.. Prerequisites 
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. To complete the interactive lab, you must create the following:

.. - A project called ``MDB_EDU``.
.. - A cluster called ``myAtlasClusterEDU``.
.. - A database user called ``myAtlasDBUser`` with the password ``myatlas-001``, and
..   the ``readWriteAnyDatabase`` permission.

.. About the Lab
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. The following lab teaches you how to create an |fts| index with
.. dynamic mapping. Then, you can run a query using the :ref:`text-ref` operator
.. and display the relevance of the matched document with its :ref:`score
.. <scoring-ref>`.

.. Click the :guilabel:`Launch` button in the in-browser Integrated
.. Development Environment to start the lab.

.. .. instruqt:: /mongodb/tracks/creating-a-search-index-with-dynamic-mapping?token=em_9fMc3LosC4PIT-Dl

.. After completing the tutorial, see :ref:`fts-operators` to learn about
.. the types of queries you can run.

Prerequisites 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To complete these tutorials, you must have the following: 

- An |service| cluster with MongoDB version 4.2 or higher.

- The :doc:`sample data </sample-data>` loaded into your |service| 
  cluster.
  
- One of the following applications to run queries on your |service|
  {+cluster+}:

  - :ref:`Search Tester <atlas-search-query-ui>`
  - {+mongosh+}
  - {+Compass+}
  - :driver:`C# </csharp/current/>`
  - :driver:`Go </go/current/>`
  - :driver:`Java </java-drivers/>`
  - :driver:`MongoDB Node Driver </node/current/>`
  - :driver:`Pymongo </pymongo/>`

.. note:: 

   You can also complete these tutorials with local |service|
   deployments that you create with the {+atlas-cli+}. To learn more,
   see :atlascli:`Create a Local Atlas Deployment
   </atlas-cli-deploy-local>`. 

About the Tutorials 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- :ref:`fts-build-applications` contains tutorials that 
  describe how to use :appservices:`{+atlas-app-services+} </>`
  and |fts| to build a search UI and add reverse search 
  to your application.

- The :ref:`null-check-tutorial` tutorial describes how to add documents
  containing ``null`` values and create a dynamic index on the
  ``sample_mflix.users`` collection. The queries search the
  ``sample_mflix.users`` collection for ``null`` and non-``null``
  fields.

- The :ref:`pagination-tutorial` describes how to use :pipeline:`$skip` 
  and :pipeline:`$limit` after the :pipeline:`$search` stage to 
  paginate query results, and the :ref:`fts-facet-aggregation-variable` 
  to return the total documents found.

- The :ref:`diacritic-insensitive-tutorial` tutorial describes how to
  create an index that uses a custom analyzer and perform a
  diacritic-insensitive search against the ``sample_mflix.movies``
  collection. The query searches the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection
  for movie titles that contain the given term regardless if the term
  contains diacritics.

- The :ref:`run-geo-search-tutorial` tutorial describes 
  how to create an index on the ``sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews`` 
  collection and run a query that returns documents with the
  ``name``, ``address``, and ``property_type``
  of each property within a specified polygon defined using ``coordinates``.
  |fts| results reflect a preference for properties of type ``condominium``, 
  and each document in the result is assigned a relevance ``score``, 
  returned in order from highest to lowest.

- The :ref:`compound-query-custom-score-tutorial` tutorial describes 
  how to create a dynamic index and run compound queries with custom 
  scoring. The queries search the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection 
  and alter the relevance score of the documents in the result using 
  :ref:`scoring-constant`, :ref:`scoring-boost`, and 
  :ref:`scoring-function` options.

- The :ref:`multilingual-tutorial` tutorial describes how to create an 
  index that uses a language analyzer and perform a multilingual search
  against the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection. The queries search the
  ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection for full movie plots that contain a
  multilingual term.

- The :ref:`partial-match-tutorial` tutorial describes how to create an 
  index on the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection and run case-sensitive
  partial match queries against the indexed field using 
  :ref:`autocomplete-ref`, :ref:`phrase-ref`, :ref:`regex-ref`, and 
  :ref:`wildcard-ref` operators.
  
- :ref:`fts-cross-collection-tutorials` contains tutorials that 
  describe how to run queries across multiple collections by first 
  combining collections using :pipeline:`$lookup`, and 
  :pipeline:`$unionWith`, and then running :pipeline:`$search` queries 
  against the collections.

- The :ref:`embedded-documents-tutorial` tutorial demonstrates how to 
  index fields of type string inside an array of objects and run 
  |fts| queries against the indexed fields.

- The :ref:`compound-query-date-range-tutorial` tutorial describes how 
  to create a dynamic index and run compound queries that use the 
  ``range`` operator. The queries search the ``sample_mflix.movies`` 
  collection for movies between a specified date range.

- The :ref:`query-nonstring-tutorial` tutorial describes how to run 
  queries against numeric and date fields using operators that 
  support only string queries. The queries search for properties that were 
  listed on certain dates and allow them to stay up to a certain number of 
  days.

- The :ref:`sort-tutorial` tutorial describes how to index date, number,
  and string in the ``sample_mflix.movies`` for sorting and how to use
  the :pipeline:`$search` ``sort`` option to sort the results in
  ascending and descending order by the indexed fields.

- The :ref:`autocomplete-tutorial` tutorial describes how to create and 
  query an |fts| index configured with an ``autocomplete`` field using 
  the ``autocomplete`` operator. We will create the |fts| index on the 
  ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection and index ``title`` field text 
  values for autocompletion. We will run |fts| queries using 
  the ``autocomplete`` operator to search the indexed field for a 
  sequence of characters.

- The :ref:`facet-tutorial` tutorial describes how to create an index 
  with a facet definition for the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection 
  and run queries against the faceted fields for results grouped by 
  values and ranges in the specified, faceted fields, including a 
  count for each of those groups.

- The :ref:`synonyms-tutorial` tutorial describes how to add a 
  collection that configures words as synonyms, create an index that 
  defines synonym mappings on the ``sample_mflix.movies`` collection, 
  and run |fts| queries against the ``title`` field using words that 
  are configured as synonyms.
