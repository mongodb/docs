|service| issues alerts for the database and server conditions
configured in your :doc:`alert settings </configure-alerts>`. When a
condition triggers an alert, |service| displays a warning symbol on the
cluster and sends alert notifications. Your alert settings determine
the notification methods. |service| continues sending notifications at
regular intervals until the condition resolves or you delete or disable
the alert.

Acknowledge Alerts
------------------

   .. tab:: Organization Alerts
      :tabid: org

      To acknowledge alerts:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/ack-org-alerts.rst

   .. tab:: Project Alerts
      :tabid: project

      To acknowledge alerts:

      .. include:: /includes/steps/ack-project-alerts.rst

If an alert uses PagerDuty for alert notifications, you can acknowledge the
alert only on your PagerDuty dashboard.

When you acknowledge an alert, |service| sends no further notifications until
either the acknowledgement period ends, you resolve the alert condition, or
you unacknowledge alert. If an alert condition ends during an acknowledgment
period, |service| sends a notification.

Increase Cluster Capacity
-------------------------

To resolve an alert by increasing your cluster's capacity, see
:doc:`/scale-cluster`.
