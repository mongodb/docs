.. method:: db.printSlaveReplicationInfo()

   .. include:: /includes/deprecated-db.printSlaveReplicationInfo.rst

   Returns a formatted report of the status of a :term:`replica set`
   from the perspective of the :term:`secondary` member of the set. The
   output is identical to that of
   :method:`rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()`.

Output
------

The following is example output from the
:method:`db.printSlaveReplicationInfo()` method issued on a replica set
with two secondary members:

.. code-block:: javascript

   source: m1.example.net:27017
       syncedTo: Thu Apr 10 2014 10:27:47 GMT-0400 (EDT)
       0 secs (0 hrs) behind the primary
   source: m2.example.net:27017
       syncedTo: Thu Apr 10 2014 10:27:47 GMT-0400 (EDT)
       0 secs (0 hrs) behind the primary

.. |method| replace:: :method:`db.printSlaveReplicationInfo()`
.. |method-alternative| replace:: :method:`rs.status()`

.. include:: /includes/note-method-does-not-return-json.rst

A :ref:`delayed member <replica-set-delayed-members>` may show as ``0``
seconds behind the primary when the inactivity period on the primary is
greater than the :rsconf:`members[n].secondaryDelaySecs`
value.
