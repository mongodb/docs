"This behavior can significantly affect the concurrency of the system as the "
"operation holds the write lock much longer than normal for storage engines "
"that take a write lock (e.g. MMAPv1), or for document-level locking storage "
"engine that normally do not take a write lock (e.g. WiredTiger), "
":update:`$isolated` operator will make WiredTiger single-threaded for the "
"duration of the operation."
