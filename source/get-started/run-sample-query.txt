==================
Run a Sample Query
==================

   :keywords: test connection, runnable, code example

After retrieving the connection string for your MongoDB Atlas deployment,
you can connect to the deployment from your PHP application and query
the Atlas sample datasets.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Edit your PHP application file

      Copy and paste the following code into the ``quickstart.php`` file, which queries
      the ``movies`` collection in the ``sample_mflix`` database:

      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/quickstart.php
         :language: php
         :dedent:

   .. step:: Assign the connection string

      Assign the ``MONGODB_URI`` environment variable to the connection string that you copied
      from the :ref:`php-connection-string` step of this guide. You can assign this
      variable by running a shell command or creating a ``.env`` file in your application,
      as show in the following tabs:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Shell Command
            :tabid: shell

            .. code-block:: sh

               export MONGODB_URI=<connection string>

         .. tab:: .env File
            :tabid: dotenv

            .. code-block:: none

               MONGODB_URI=<connection string>

   .. step:: Run your PHP application

      In your project directory, run the following shell command to start the application:
      
      .. code-block:: bash

         php quickstart.php

      The command line output contains details about the retrieved movie
      document:

      .. code-block:: none
         :copyable: false

         {
             "_id": {
                 "$oid": "..."
             },
             ...
            "rated": "R",
            "metacritic": 80,
            "title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
            ...
         }

      If you encounter an error or see no output, ensure that you assigned the
      proper connection string to the ``MONGODB_URI`` environment variable and
      that you loaded the sample data.

After you complete these steps, you have a PHP application that
connects to your MongoDB deployment, runs a query on the sample
data, and returns a matching document.
