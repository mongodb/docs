{+adf+} is a distributed query engine that allows you to natively 
query, transform, and move data across various sources inside and
outside of |service-fullname|. This page highlights key features,
tutorials, and resources for integrating {+df+} into your
applications.

Use Cases
---------

You can use {+adf+} to:

- Copy |service| {+cluster+} data into Parquet or |csv| files written to 
  |aws| |s3| buckets or {+az-bs+}. 
- Query across multiple |service| {+clusters+} and online archives to get a
  holistic view of your |service| data.
- Materialize data from aggregations across |service| {+clusters+}, |aws|
  |s3| buckets, and {+az-bs+}.
- Read and import data from your |aws| |s3| buckets or {+az-bs+} into an |service| 
  {+cluster+}.

Get Started
-----------

Learn how to create and connect to a sample {+fdi+} in Atlas.

To get started, see :ref:`Get Started with Atlas Data Federation <adf-getting-started>`.

Advanced Security Options
-------------------------

Explore {+adf+} advanced security options, including private endpoints,
authentication methods, and advanced user configuration options.

See :ref:`Atlas Data Federation Advanced Security Options <adf-advanced-security-options>`
for more information.

Define Data Stores
------------------

Configure and define data sources for your {+fdi+}. Support for data
sources include |service-fullname| clusters, AWS S3 buckets, Azure Blob
storage containers, Google Cloud storage buckets, HTTP URLs, and
Online Archives.

See :ref:`Configure Data Stores for a Federated Database Instance <config-adf>`.

Administration
--------------

Discover features to manage your |service-fullname| {+fdi+}.

See :ref:`Administer Federated Database Instances <adf-administration>`.

MQL
---

Learn how to query federated data using MongoDB Query Language (MQL).

See :ref:`Query a Federated Database Instance <query-fdi>`.

SQL
---

Leverage the {+sql-interface+} to query federated data sources.

See :ref:`Connect With SQL <connect-with-sql-overview>`.

Data Federation Tutorials
-------------------------

Browse advanced tutorials for implementing practical use cases
for {+adf+}.

See :ref:`Data Federation Tutorials <adf-tutorials>`.

Features
--------

|service-fullname| {+df+} supports multiple data formats and
provides you with various operations to interact with {+adf+}.

See :ref:`Supported Features <supported-unsupported>`.

Limitations
-----------

See :ref:`Data Federation Limitations <df-limitations>` for information
on unsupported features.
