Resource Requirements
---------------------

.. _index-size-and-config:

Index Size and Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   If you create an |fts| index for a collection that has or will soon 
   have more than 2.1 billion index objects, you must use ``numPartitions``
   or :ref:`shard your cluster <create-cluster-sharding>`. Index partitions
   are limited to 2.1 billion objects per partition.

When you :ref:`create <ref-create-index>` an |fts| index, field mapping 
defaults to :ref:`dynamic <static-dynamic-mappings>`, which means that 
|fts| dynamically indexes all the :ref:`datatypes that can be 
dynamically indexed <bson-data-chart>` in your collection. Other options
such as enabling highlights can also result in your index taking up more
disk space. You can reduce the size and performance footprint of your
|fts| index by:

- Specifying a custom :ref:`index definition
  <ref-index-definitions>` to narrow the amount and type of data that is
  indexed.

- Setting the ``store`` option to ``false`` when specifying a 
  :ref:`string <bson-data-types-string>` type in an index definition.

.. note::

   Some limitations apply to |fts| on ``M0``, ``M2``, and ``M5``
   clusters only. To learn more, see 
   :ref:`Atlas Search Free and Shared Tier Limitations 
   <atlas-fts-shared-tier-limitations>`.

Considerations
``````````````

Some index configuration options can lead to indexes that take up a 
significant proportion of your disk space. In some cases, your index 
could be many times larger than the size of your data. Although this is 
expected behavior, it's important to be aware of the following 
indexing-intensive features:

Autocomplete
++++++++++++

The |fts| :ref:`autocomplete-ref` operator can be used to build
functionality similar to search-as-you-type in your application. The 
|fts| :ref:`autocomplete <bson-data-types-autocomplete>` field type
can cause large indexes, especially in the following cases:

- Using ``nGram`` tokenization.
- Setting a wide ``minGrams`` to ``maxGrams``  range.
- Setting a ``minGram`` value of ``1`` on a collection with millions of 
  documents.

You can reduce the space used by the ``autocomplete`` type index by
doing the following:

- Reduce the range of ``minGrams`` and ``maxGrams`` to the minimum.
  Generally, we recommend setting ``maxGrams`` to the character count of
  the longest word in the field that you want to query. If you are
  unsure, for English language fields, we recommend starting with
  ``maxGrams`` value of ``10``.
- Avoid ``nGram`` tokenization strategy as, for a given string, |fts|
  creates more tokens for ``nGram`` than for ``edgeGram`` or
  ``rightEdgeGram`` tokenization. 

When indexing a ``string`` field as the :ref:`autocomplete
<bson-data-types-autocomplete>` type, we recommend that you index the
field as the |fts| :ref:`string <bson-data-types-string>` type also for 
the following advantages: 

- Boost the score of exact matches when using the
  :ref:`autocomplete-ref` operator. For an example, see the Advanced
  Example in the :ref:`autocomplete-tutorial` tutorial.
- Query the same field in the same query using the 
  :ref:`autocomplete-ref` operator and another operator that supports
  string search, such as the :ref:`text-ref` operator. For an example,
  see the :ref:`autocomplete-compound` example.

Embedded Documents 
++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/fact-fts-embedded-documents-limitation.rst

Faceted Search 
++++++++++++++

If you want to filter and facet your data using the same field, we
recommend that you index the field as following |fts| types: 

- :ref:`stringFacet <bson-data-types-string-facet>` and :ref:`token
  <bson-data-types-token>`  
- :ref:`numberFacet <bson-data-types-number-facet>` and 
  :ref:`number <bson-data-types-number>` 
- :ref:`dateFacet <bson-data-types-date-facet>` and :ref:`date
  <bson-data-types-date>`

For an example of filtering the data by another field for faceting, see
the :ref:`facet-tutorial` tutorial.

``multi`` Analyzers
+++++++++++++++++++

Using a ``multi`` analyzer to analyze the same field multiple 
different ways can cause large indexes, especially when analyzing 
fields with very long values.

Multilingual Search 
+++++++++++++++++++

You can use the |fts| :ref:`ref-language-analyzers` to index many 
languages. For the list of languages for which |fts| provides built-in
analyzers, see the :ref:`ref-language-analyzers`. For an example, see
the :ref:`multilingual-tutorial` tutorial. To index and query languages
that are currently not in the list of built-in
:ref:`ref-language-analyzers`, you can create a :ref:`custom analyzer
<custom-analyzers>`. For an example, see the 
:ref:`custom-language-analyzer-eg`. 

Suppose you have one document for each language in your collection.
Consider the following:  

- You can index the fields separately in the same index using the
  :ref:`ref-language-analyzers`. A single index can support multiple
  languages in the same query. 

- Alternatively, you can create an index per language, which is useful
  in isolating the different language documents. Note that each index
  is a change stream cursor and so this might be expensive to
  maintain.

- If you have the language documents nested inside a parent document,
  you can create a single index. However, your index definition payload 
  might be large and your query might be complex. 

To learn more about these data models and index definitions, see the
`MongoDB blog <https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/atlas-search-multi-language-data-modeling/>`__. 

Synonym Collections
+++++++++++++++++++

Inserts and updates to a synonym source collection are fast only if the 
synonym source collection is small. For best performance, we recommend 
batching inserts and updates to synonym source collections. 

A :ref:`synonym mapping <synonyms-ref>` definition doesn't require 
additional disk space aside from the disk space utilized by the synonym 
collection in the database. However, synonym mappings create artifacts 
in memory and therefore, for synonym collections with many documents, 
|fts| creates artifacts that occupy more memory.

.. _fts-search-memory-management:

Search Memory Management
````````````````````````

|fts| uses both filesystem cache and JVM heap memory. It stores
various objects like query objects, searcher objects, and other
temporary data used during indexing and search operations in the JVM 
heap to process and track the query. It stores memory mapped
files such as segment files, dictionary files, and the like in the
filesystem cache to enhance its performance, especially when reading
index files. 

In deployments where both the ``mongod`` and ``mongot`` processes run on 
the same node, the memory allocated to the ``mongod`` varies based on
the {+cluster+} tier:  

- For ``M40`` and higher tier {+clusters+}, ``mongod`` dedicates 50% or
  more of the physical RAM for the WiredTiger cache and the remaining memory
  is reserved for in-memory operations, underlying operation systems,
  and other system services.
- For ``M30`` and lower tier {+clusters+}, ``mongod`` dedicates 25% of
  the physical RAM for the WiredTiger cache.

Therefore, the memory allocated to ``mongot`` is a subset of the total
RAM, which can result in resource contention issues between ``mongod``
and ``mongot`` for not only memory, but also for CPU and Disk IO.

In deployments where the ``mongot`` process runs on separate search
nodes, |service| allocates a part of the available RAM to the JVM heap, and uses a small
amount of memory processes like monitoring and
automation, and the rest of the memory is available for search. 

If your search indexes are large and available memory is low, you might
observe performance degradation during indexing and querying due to
insufficient memory. Search indexes might be large if you enable dynamic 
mappings in your index for documents with arbitrary keys. This could
cause :ref:`mapping explosions <index-document-mapping-explosions>`. The
excessive memory consumption by ``mongot`` can also result in ``mongot``
running :abbr:`OOM (Out Of Memory)`, which might also crash ``mongot``. 

You can use the following metrics to determine if ``mongot`` is running
:abbr:`OOM (Out Of Memory)`: 

- An increase in the number of ``Search Page Faults`` and ``Disk IOPS``.
  This happens if   the OS keeps retrieving the required pages from disk
  and reads them into the RAM. 
- Elevated levels of ``Normalized Process/System CPU`` and ``IOWait``,
  which can result in degraded performance.

We recommend :ref:`migrating to dedicated search nodes
<fts-migrate-to-decoupled>` for your production-ready applications. It
is important to right-size the Search Node because low memory can lead
to performance issues.   

.. _index-create-and-update:

Creating and Updating an Atlas Search Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating an |fts| index is resource-intensive. The performance of your
|service| cluster may be impacted while the index builds. 

|service| replicates all writes on the collection. This means that for 
each collection with |fts| indexes, the writes are amplified to the 
amount of |fts| indexes defined for that collection. 

In some instances, your |fts| index must be rebuilt. Rebuilding the 
|fts| index also consumes resources and may affect database 
performance. |fts| automatically rebuilds the index only in the event 
of:

- :ref:`Changes <ref-edit-index>` to the index definition :icon-fa5:`star`
- |fts| version updates that include breaking changes
- Hardware-related problems such as index corruption

.. note:: 

   |fts| supports no-downtime indexing, which means you can continue to 
   run search queries while |fts| rebuilds your index. |fts| keeps your 
   old index up-to-date while the new index is being built. We 
   recommend allocating *free* disk space equal to 125% of the disk 
   space used by your old index for this operation. You can view the 
   amount of disk space currently used by your index in the 
   :doc:`Search Disk Space Used </review-atlas-search-metrics/>` 
   metric. 

   If your index rebuild fails due to insufficient disk space, we 
   recommend that you temporarily expand your cluster capacity to meet 
   the increased demand. You can make this change manually as described in 
   :doc:`Fix Storage Issues </reference/alert-resolutions/disk-space-used/>`, 
   even for clusters with autoscaling enabled.

   If you deployed separate Search Nodes, for certain changes such as
   :ref:`Java 21 upgrade <fts20240628>`, |service| automatically deploys
   additional Search Nodes for the duration of the index rebuild and you
   don't need to allocate any additional free disk space. |service|
   doesn't deploy additional search nodes for an index rebuild that is
   caused by changes made to that index's definition. 

   Once |fts| rebuilds the index, the old index is automatically 
   replaced without any further action from your side.

.. _index-eventual-consistency-and-latency:

Eventual Consistency and Indexing Latency 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|fts| supports eventual consistency and does not provide any stronger 
consistency guarantees. This means that data inserted into a MongoDB 
collection and indexed by |fts| will not be available immediately for 
``$search`` queries.

|fts| reads data from MongoDB :manual:`change streams 
</changeStreams/>` and indexes that data in an asynchronous process. 
This process is typically very fast, but might sometimes be impacted by 
replication latency, system resource availability, and index definition 
complexity. A large number of |fts| indexes might also contribute to 
replication lag and latency for |fts| indexes. 

.. _index-document-mapping-explosions:

Document Mapping Explosions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mapping explosions occur when |fts| indexes a document with arbitrary 
keys and you have a :ref:`dynamic mapping <static-dynamic-mappings>`. 
The ``mongot`` process might consume increasing amounts of memory and 
could crash. If you add too many fields to an index, mapping explosions 
can occur. To address this issue, you can upgrade your cluster or use a 
:ref:`static mapping <static-dynamic-mappings>` that does not index all 
fields in your data.

When searching over fields using a wildcard path, design your search to use 
a tuple-like schema. If you perform a wildcard path search that uses a 
key-value schema, |fts| indexes each key as its own field, 
which can cause mapping explosions.

.. example::

   An example of a key-value schema 
   is as follows:

   .. code-block::

      ruleBuilder: {
        ruleName1: <data>, 
        ruleName2: <data>,
        ..... 
        ruleName1025: <data>
      }
   
   An example of the same data
   restructured to use a tuple-like schema is as follows:

   .. code-block::

      {
        ruleBuilder: [
          {name: ruleName1, data: <data>},
          {name: ruleName2, data: <data>},
          ...
          {name: ruleName1025, data: <data>}
        ]
      } 

.. _perf-ref-stored-source:

Storing Source Fields 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can :ref:`configure <fts-stored-source-definition>` fields to 
store on |fts| and improve performance of subsequent aggregation 
pipeline stages like :pipeline:`$sort`, :pipeline:`$match`, 
:pipeline:`$group`, and :pipeline:`$skip`. Use this optimization if 
your original documents and matched dataset are so large that a full 
data lookup is inefficient. To learn more about storing specific fields 
on |fts| and returning those stored fields only, see 
:ref:`fts-stored-source-definition` and 
:ref:`fts-return-stored-source-option`.

We recommend storing only the minimum number of fields required for 
subsequent stages. If necessary, you can use :pipeline:`$lookup` at 
the end of the pipeline stage to retrieve entire documents as shown in 
the :ref:`fts-return-stored-source-egs`. Storing unnecessary fields 
increases disk utilization and could negatively impact performance 
during indexing and querying. 

Scaling Considerations
----------------------

.. _index-fts-upgrade:

|fts| Upgrade 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|fts| is deployed on your |service| cluster. When a new version of 
|fts| is deployed, your |service| cluster might experience brief 
network failures in returning query results. To mitigate issues during 
deployment and minimize impact to your application, consider the 
following: 

- Implement retry logic in your application.
- Configure |service| :ref:`maintenance windows 
  <configure-maintenance-window>`.

  .. note:: 

     |fts| upgrades start only during the maintenance window and might
     continue after the maintenance window.

To learn more about the changes in each release, see :doc:`Atlas 
Search Changelog </atlas-search/changelog/>`.

.. _index-scaling-up-perf:

Scaling Up Indexing Performance 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can scale up your initial sync and steady state indexing for an 
|fts| index by upgrading your cluster to a higher :ref:`tier 
<create-cluster-instance>` with more cores. |fts| uses a percentage of 
all available cores to run both initial sync and steady state indexing 
and performance improves as new cores are made available by upgrading 
your cluster.

.. _index-search-nodes-perf:

|service| {+Cluster+} Configuration Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you reconfigure your deployment to use the local |nvme| storage type
or upscale an |nvme|-based {+cluster+}, |fts| performs an initial sync
of all configured |fts| indexes after each node completes its underlying
configuration or upscale action. If the |fts| index initial syncs take
longer than the time it took to complete the {+cluster+} configuration
change, you can't run :pipeline:`$search` queries until the initial
sync completes on all the nodes in your |service| {+cluster+}. 

We recommend deploying :ref:`dedicated Search Nodes
<configure-search-nodes>` to scale your |service| {+cluster+} and
:pipeline:`$search` workloads independently. Dedicated Search Nodes
run only the ``mongot`` process and therefore improve the availability, 
performance, and workload balancing of the ``mongot`` process.
