Sources of Data Transfer Costs
------------------------------

|service| data transfer costs depend on the cloud service provider
hosting your {+database-deployment+}. |service| tabulates data transfer 
costs daily.

.. tabs-cloud-providers::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: azure

      |service| charges for data transfer between your |service| node
      and another node. The following transfers incur costs, listed in order
      of lowest cost to highest:

      1. Data transfer using in-region VNet peering.

      #. Data transfer to a different region. Data transfer charges for an |service|
         cluster depend on the geographic location of the source node.

      #. Data transfer using cross-region VNet peering.

      Transfer Cost Exceptions and Behavior
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      |service| doesn't charge for incoming data transfers to an |service|
      {+cluster+}. Additionally, |service| doesn't charge ``M0``,
      ``M2`` (deprecated), ``M5`` (deprecated), or {+Flex-cluster+} tiers
      for outgoing data.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: aws

      |service| charges for data transfer between your |service| node
      and another node. The following transfers incur costs, listed in order
      of lowest cost to highest:

      1. Data transfer in the same |aws| region.

      #. Data transfer between different |aws| regions.

      #. Data transfer to a location outside of an |aws| region, 
         excluding incoming transfers to the |service| node.
      
      {+Cloud-Backup+} Snapshot Export
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      .. include:: /includes/fact-snapshot-export-cost.rst

      To learn more about cloud backup snapshot export, see 
      :ref:`cloud-provider-snapshot-export`.

      Transfer Cost Exceptions and Behavior
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      |service| doesn't charge for incoming data transfers to an |service|
      {+cluster+}. Additionally, |service| doesn't charge ``M0``,
      ``M2`` (deprecated), ``M5`` (deprecated), or {+Flex-cluster+} tiers
      for outgoing data.

      For |aws| clusters deployed outside of the North America region where 
      the |service| Control Plane is located, invoices will include an 
      ``AWS Data Transfer (different region)`` item that results from the 
      inherited network traffic, such as heartbeats, the automation agent, 
      and the |pa|, sent between the |aws| North America region with the 
      |service| control plane, and the |aws| region where the clusters are 
      deployed. 

   .. tab::
      :tabid: gcp

      |service| charges for data transfer between your |service| node
      and another node. The following transfers incur costs, listed in order
      of lowest cost to highest:

      1. Data transfer between zones in the same region.

      #. Data transfer between regions in the United States of America.

      #. Data transfer between continents.

      #. Data transfer between regions in the same continent 
         other than the United States of America.

      #. Data transfer to a location outside of a |gcp| data center, 
         excluding incoming transfers to the |service| node.

      Transfer Cost Exceptions and Behavior
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      |service| doesn't charge for incoming data transfers to an |service|
      {+cluster+}. Additionally, |service| doesn't charge ``M0``,
      ``M2`` (deprecated), ``M5`` (deprecated), or {+Flex-cluster+} tiers
      for outgoing data.

{+Clusters+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multi-region {+clusters+} might have higher
data transfer costs depending on the number and location of additional
regions, as well as the number of {+clusters+} deployed to each region.

{+Serverless-Instances+} (Deprecated)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+Serverless-instances+} are :ref:`deprecated <flex-migration>`.
{+Serverless-instances+} incur costs for data transfer to and from
the virtual machine responsible for backing up and restoring data.

Push-based Log Exports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exporting :ref:`push-based logs <mongodb-logs-push>` 
incurs costs for data transfer.

Data Egress
~~~~~~~~~~~

|service| typically charges $0.09 per GB for egress data transfer over
the Internet.

Data transfer between or within AWS regions have lower costs.

Live Migrate Your Data to |service|
-----------------------------------

MongoDB hosts and operates the free |service| Live Migration Service to
help users migrate existing MongoDB databases to |service-fullname|.
MongoDB doesn't charge for any incoming data transfers to an |service|
{+database-deployment+}.

How to Reduce Data Transfer Costs
---------------------------------

The vast majority of |service| customers spend less than 10% of their
budget on data transfer. If you are spending significantly more, some
of these optimizations may reduce your data transfer costs:

- Check all applications and processes that access your data for
  inefficiencies. Ensure that queries do not:

  - Re-read data that already exists on the client.

  - Re-write existing data to your {+database-deployment+}.

- Ensure that queries originate from the same cloud
  region and provider as your {+database-deployment+} whenever possible.

  When cross-region queries are necessary:

  - Ensure read queries
    :manual:`use the preference "nearest."</core/read-preference>`

  - Source write queries from your :guilabel:`Highest Priority Region`
    whenever possible. For more information on region priorities, see
    :ref:`Electable Nodes for High Availability
    <deploy-across-multiple-regions>`.

- Perform query operations with :manual:`projection <tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results/#project-fields-to-return-from-query>` 
  to specify or restrict the fields that MongoDB returns in matching documents, thereby limiting the 
  amount of data that MongoDB sends to applications. Alternatively, project document fields using the 
  :pipeline:`$project` aggregation stage from the :manual:`Aggregation Framework </aggregation>` to 
  reduce the size of a document before you transfer it.

- Enable network compression in your client driver to compress data between the client and the server. As an 
  example, you can configure the :driver:`network compression <node/current/fundamentals/connection/network-compression/>` 
  option for your Node.js driver. |service| always compresses intra-cluster communication. To learn more, see the 
  :driver:`Driver's Documentation </>`.

.. note::

   Queries from on-premises environments into |service|, across cloud
   providers, or between continents on the same cloud provider incur
   the greatest data transfer costs.
