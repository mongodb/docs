msgid "Starting with MongoDB 3.6, MongoDB binaries, :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`, bind to ``localhost`` by default. From MongoDB versions 2.6 to 3.4, only the binaries from the official MongoDB RPM (Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora Linux, and derivatives) and DEB (Debian, Ubuntu, and derivatives) packages would bind to ``localhost`` by default. To learn more about this change, see :ref:`3.6-bind_ip-compatibility`."

msgid "Before binding to a non-localhost (e.g. publicly accessible) IP address, ensure you have secured your cluster from unauthorized access. For a complete list of security recommendations, see :doc:`/administration/security-checklist`. At minimum, consider :ref:`enabling authentication <checklist-auth>` and :doc:`hardening network infrastructure </core/security-network>`."
