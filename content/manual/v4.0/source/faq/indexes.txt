This document addresses some common questions regarding MongoDB
:doc:`indexes </indexes>`. For more information on indexes, see
:doc:`/indexes`.

How do I create an index?
-------------------------

To create an index on a collection, use the
:method:`db.collection.createIndex()` method. Creating an index is an
administrative operation. In general, applications should not call
:method:`db.collection.createIndex()` on a regular basis.

.. note:: 

   Index builds can impact performance; see
   :ref:`faq-index-performance`. Administrators should consider the
   performance implications before building indexes.

.. _faq-index-performance:

How does an index build affect database performance?
----------------------------------------------------

When building an index on a collection, the database that holds the
collection is unavailable for read or write operations until the index
build completes. If you need to build a large index, consider building
the index in the :ref:`background <index-creation-background>`. See
:ref:`index-creation-operations` and
:doc:`/tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets`.

To return information on currently running index creation operations,
see :ref:`currentOp-index-creation`. To kill a running index creation
operation, see :method:`db.killOp()`. The partially built index will be
deleted.

How do I see what indexes exist on a collection?
------------------------------------------------

To list a collection's indexes, use the
:method:`db.collection.getIndexes()` method.

How can I see if a query uses an index?
---------------------------------------

To inspect how MongoDB processes a query, use the
:method:`~cursor.explain()` method.

How do I determine which fields to index?
-----------------------------------------

A number of factors determine which fields to index, including
:ref:`selectivity <index-selectivity>`, the support for multiple
:term:`query shapes <query shape>`, and :doc:`size of the index
</tutorial/ensure-indexes-fit-ram>`. For more information, see
:ref:`Operational Considerations for Indexes <data-model-indexes>` and
:doc:`/applications/indexes`.

How can I see the size of an index?
-----------------------------------

The :method:`db.collection.stats()` includes an
:data:`~collStats.indexSizes` document which provides size
information for each index on the collection.

Depending on its size, an index may not fit into RAM. An index fits
into RAM when your server has enough RAM available for both the index
and the rest of the :term:`working set`. When an index is too large to
fit into RAM, MongoDB must read the index from disk, which is a much
slower operation than reading from RAM.

In certain cases, an index does not need to fit *entirely* into RAM.
For details, see :ref:`indexing-right-handed`.

How do write operations affect indexes?
---------------------------------------

Write operations may require updates to indexes:

- If a write operation modifies an indexed field, MongoDB updates all
  indexes that have the modified field as a key.

- When running with the :doc:`MMAPv1 </core/mmapv1>` storage engine, if
  an update to a document causes the document to grow past its
  allocated record size, MongoDB moves the document to a new record and
  updates all indexes that refer to the document, regardless of the
  field modified.

Therefore, if your application is write-heavy, indexes might affect
performance.
