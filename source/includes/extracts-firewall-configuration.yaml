  Overview
  --------

  |mms| requires access on the ports and IP addresses described here.

  Required Outbound Access
  ------------------------

  The agents connect to |mms| on port ``443``. Whether you provision your
  servers on a cloud service provider or on your own network, configure your network
  infrastructure to allow outbound connections on port ``443``.

  If you wish to restrict outbound access on port ``443`` to specific IP
  addresses, you must keep open gtrethe following addresses and domains.

  IP Addresses for GET and POST
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You must keep open the following addresses on port ``443`` so that the
  agents can ``GET`` AND ``POST`` to the ``api-agents.mongodb.com`` and
  ``api-backup.mongodb.com`` servers:

  - ``54.173.82.137``

  - ``54.175.147.155``
  
  - ``52.21.89.200``

  Domain for Download of MongoDB Binaries
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Automation Agents require outbound access on port ``443`` to the
  following domains, depending on your MongoDB edition, for downloading
  MongoDB binaries:

  - For the MongoDB community edition, the Automation Agents require
    outbound access on port ``443`` to download binaries from the
    ``fastdl.mongodb.org`` domain, provided by Amazon CloudFront. The IP
    ranges for CloudFront change frequently. See `the current list of IP
    ranges for CloudFront
    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/LocationsOfEdgeServers.html>`_.

  - If you use Automation with `MongoDB Enterprise
    <http://www.mongodb.com/products/mongodb-enterprise>`_, the
    Automation Agents require outbound access on port ``443`` to the
    ``downloads.mongodb.com`` domain in order to download the Enterprise
    binaries.

  - If you use automation with a custom build of MongoDB, the custom
    build must be available at a URL accessible to the Automation Agent.
    It could, for example, be served by a web server running inside an
    isolated network environment. The custom build's ``Git Version``
    field must be set to the output of the following command, issued on
    the target binary.

    .. code-block:: javascript

       mongod --version

  Required Inbound Access (Auto-Provisioning Only)
  ------------------------------------------------

  If you use |mms| :doc:`provisioning </tutorial/provision-cloud-servers>`,
  you must grant SSH access to the following ranges at minimum:

  - ``4.71.186.128/25``

  - ``4.35.16.128/25``

  .. important::

     MongoDB reserves the right to change these IP addresses at any time
     without user notice.

  For additional information, see :doc:`/tutorial/configure-cloud-server-settings`.

  If you do **not** use |mms| :doc:`provisioning
  </tutorial/provision-cloud-servers>`, you do not need to keep any inbound
  ports open.

  Required Ports on Your Network
  ------------------------------

  All MongoDB processes in a deployment must be accessible to all |mms|
  agents managing processes in that deployment.
  Therefore, all MongoDB ports must be open to every server that hosts an
  Automation, Monitoring or Backup Agent. For example, if you are running
  MongoDB processes on ``27000``, ``27017`` and ``27020``, then those
  three ports must be open from all servers that are hosting an
  Agent.

  Overview
  --------

  |mms| components use the default ports and health-check endpoints
  described here.

  |http-service|
  --------------

  .. describe:: 8080

     Web server, available from browsers. The Monitoring Agent and Backup
     Agent must be able to access this port.

  .. describe:: 8090

     *Optional*

     Used for internal diagnostics. Only available on the localhost interface.

  Backup Daemon
  -------------

  .. describe:: 8640

     A "kill-port" that the control script uses to signal a shutdown.

     Only available on the localhost interface.

  .. describe:: 27500-27503

     The Backup Daemon uses this port range to on the localhost
     interface to run :program:`mongod` instances to apply oplog entries
     to maintain the local copies of the backed up database.

  .. describe:: 8091

     *Optional*

     Used for internal diagnostics. Only available on the localhost interface.

  Monitoring HTTP Endpoints
  -------------------------

  |onprem| provides health-check endpoints for the monitoring of the 
  |onprem| components via a standard monitoring service, such as Zabbix or
  Nagios. These endpoints are only accessible on the ``localhost`` interface.

  HTTP Service Endpoint
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The following endpoint checks the connections from the service to the
  :ref:`mms-application-database` and the
  :ref:`mms-backup-blockstore-database`.

  .. code-block:: sh

     http://localhost:8090/health

  A successful response from the endpoint returns the following:

  .. code-block:: sh

     {
       "mms_db": "OK",
       "backup_db": "OK"
     }

  .. _backup-daemon-endpoint:

  Backup Daemon Endpoint
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The :ref:`Backup Daemon <backup-daemon>` on the Backup Daemon server
  exposes a health-check endpoint at:

  .. code-block:: sh

     http://localhost:8091
...
