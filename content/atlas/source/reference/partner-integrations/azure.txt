The |azure| Native Integration allows you to create |service| organizations self-service, 
automatically billed through your |azure| invoice.

.. _azure-getting-started:

Find Atlas in Azure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are an |azure| user with any role, you can discover |service| through the following methods:

* Search for MongoDB |service| using the search bar in the |azure| dashboard and view |service| 
  under :guilabel:`Services` and :guilabel:`Marketplace` in the search results.

* Navigate to :guilabel:`All services`, then to :guilabel:`Databases`, from which you can select 
  :guilabel:`MongoDB Atlas`.

* Navigate to :guilabel:`Marketplace`, then to :guilabel:`Databases`, from which you can select 
  :guilabel:`MongoDB Atlas`.

Create an Atlas Organization as an Azure Native Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can provision |service| as an |azure| Native Integration within |azure| by filling 
out a :guilabel:`Create a MongoDB Atlas Organization` form, specifying the organization 
name, the |azure| resource to which it will be linked, and billing plan details. 

See the `Overview of Azure Native Integrations <https://aka.ms/ANI/MongoDBAtlas/Docs>`__ 
to learn more.

Prerequisites
``````````````

- You have an Owner or a Contributor role in the |azure| subscription.
- The |service| organization name that you input meets |service| naming conventions: 
  organization names can't be longer than 64 characters and can only contain letters, numbers, 
  spaces, and the following symbols: (), @, &, +. :, ., _, -, ', ,.

After |azure| generates an |service| resource, |service| will:

1. Create an |service| organization.
2. Grant the user the :authrole:`Organization Owner` role in |service|. This sends the user an 
   invitation to join the |service| organization and configure their account.
3. Link billing of the |service| organization to the |azure| marketplace billing offer. 

Supported Regions
````````````````````

The |azure| Native Integration supports the  **US East** region only for creating
organizations. To deploy an organization in another region, create your deployment
directly through |service| rather than through the |azure| Native Integration.


Billing
~~~~~~~~

|azure| Native Integration creates new |service| Orgs from |azure| which are automatically connected 
to an |azure| marketplace billing plan for the |azure| Native Integration.

In |azure| and |service|, you will see confirmation of |azure| marketplace billing for the |service| 
organization.

Create Your Atlas User Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the |service| organization is provisioned, |service| creates an account for the email address of the 
|azure| user who initiated provisioning. The user account that |service| creates uses the email address 
configured in the user's |azure| account. If you are a new user, you will need to configure your |service| 
user account by setting your password. You can access |service| to configure your account in the following 
ways:

1. You see a confirmation in |azure| that the |service| organization is successfully created.
2. You see a ``Go to Atlas`` link in |azure|, and receive a ``Get started with your new Atlas Organization`` 
   email with this link. 
3. You click the link and goes to |service|. If you are a new user, you are prompted to set your password.
4. You see your organization as the :authrole:`Organization Owner`.

.. note::
   
   If your email domain is already registered for |sso| with |service|, you don't have to set a password.

Once your new organization is created, MongoDB recommends that you: 

* Invite your teammates to |service| to collaborate.
* Set up |sso| with Microsoft Entra ID. See :ref:`Configure Federated Authentication from Microsoft Entra ID <federated-auth-azure-ad>` to learn more.
* Create clusters.

.. note::

   |service| organizations created through Azure Native Integration can host clusters only on |azure|.

.. _viewing-and-mananging-orgs:

View Your Organization in Azure and |service|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can view and manage your organization in the MongoDB |service| portal by clicking on the :guilabel:`Go to MongoDB Atlas` 
portal URL on the :guilabel:`MongoDB Resource Overview` page.

.. image:: /images/azure-atlas-organization-portal-url.png 
   :alt: Azure Atlas Organization Portal URL
   :figwidth: 100%

Alternatively, you can access the organization directly from your |service| dashboard.

Unlink Your Organization from Azure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are an |azure| Subscription Owner or a Contributor, you can unlink your MongoDB |service| instance from 
|azure|, which unlinks the |service| organization from Azure Native Integration and |azure| marketplace billing, 
but doesn't delete the organization in |service|. 

If paid clusters exist on the organization when |azure| billing is removed, users will need to provide a payment 
method within |service| to avoid the suspension or termination of services.
