You can use |service| to generate queries using natural language. 
|service| uses AI to generate queries based on prompts you provide. Querying 
with natural language can be a helpful starting point and assist you in learning 
to write MongoDB queries.

.. note::

   .. include:: /atlas-ui/includes/shared/fact-natural-language-query.rst

About this Task
---------------

You can query with natural language to create both queries and aggregations. If 
your prompt results in an aggregation, you are automatically redirected to the 
:guilabel:`Aggregations` tab and a pop-up message displays indicating that your 
prompt requires aggregation stages.

You can also provide natural language prompts on the 
:ref:`aggregations tab <atlas-ui-prompt-natural-language-agg>`.

Before you Begin
----------------

You must :ref:`enable natural language querying 
<atlas-ui-enable-natural-language-querying>`.

Steps
-----

The examples on this page use the :ref:`sample_mflix.movies <sample-mflix>` 
collection from the Atlas sample dataset.

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-data-explorer.rst

   .. step:: Navigate to the :guilabel:`Natural Language Query Bar`
      
      a. Select the collection.
      
      #. Select the :guilabel:`Documents` tab.
      
      #. Click the :guilabel:`Generate query` button.
      
      #. .. include:: /includes/fact-natural-language-query-accept.rst

   .. step:: Type a question about your collection

      Type a natural language prompt for your collection into the query 
      bar. For example: ``Which movies were released in 2000?``

      a. Press enter or click the :guilabel:`Generate query` button.

      #. A filter query populates in the :guilabel:`Filter` bar.

      .. tip::
      
         It is also possible to paste SQL or queries from application code into the
         :guilabel:`Natural Language Query Bar`. 

   .. step:: Run the query

      a. Before running the query, make sure to thoroughly review the 
         syntax in the :guilabel:`Filter` bar. Ensure the returned 
         query has the fields and operators that match your desired use case.
         
      #. Press enter or click the :guilabel:`Find` button to execute 
         the query.

      The results populate in the documents view.

Example
-------

Below are examples of prompts to help you understand expected results 
when using natural language prompts.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Prompt
     - Response

   * - ``Which movies have a "PG" rating?``
     - .. code-block:: json
          :copyable: false

          {"rated": "PG"}

   * - ``Which movies include "David Mamet" in the writers array field?``
     - .. code-block:: json
          :copyable: false

          {"writers": "David Mamet"}

   * - ``Which movies have a runtime greater than 90?``
     - .. code-block:: json
          :copyable: false

          {"runtime": {$gt: 90}}
