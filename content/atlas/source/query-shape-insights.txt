You can monitor operation-level query execution metrics for 
:manual:`query shapes </core/query-shapes/>` with slow-running queries 
using Query Shape Insights. The :guilabel:`Query Shape Insights` page 
displays charts and a table that describe the performance metrics
for the query shapes in your project with the highest total 
execution time. You can filter the displayed query shape data by 
host, shard, and time range, and select up to five query shapes to 
visualize in the corresponding metric charts. 

|service| supports Query Shape Insights on only dedicated clusters
(M10 and above) running MongoDB version 8.0 and above. 

.. note:: 

   To ensure performance and scalability for clusters with high query
   volume, Query Shape Insights may display data from a sample set of 
   the total queries run on your cluster. 

Required Access
---------------

To view metrics with Query Shape Insights, you 
must have :authrole:`Project Observability Viewer`,
:authrole:`Project Data Access Read Only`,
:authrole:`Project Data Access Read/Write`,
:authrole:`Project Data Access Admin`, or :authrole:`Project Owner` 
access to the project.

.. important:: 

   Query shapes exposing field names but redacted values may contain user 
   :abbr:`PII (Personally Identifiable Information)`. 
   To view truncated or full query shapes in Query Shape Insights, 
   you must have one of the project roles listed above, which each give 
   access to view :abbr:`PII (Personally Identifiable Information)`. 
   For users without these permissions, Query Shape Insights identifies 
   query shapes by their query shape hash. 

Access Query Shape Insights
---------------------------

To access Query Shape Insights:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/nav/steps-db-deployments-page.rst
   
   .. step:: Go to :guilabel:`Query Shape Insights`.  

      a. Click :guilabel:`View Monitoring` for that instance in the 
         project panel.
     
      #. Click the :guilabel:`Query Insights` tab.
  
         The :guilabel:`Query Shapes` tab displays by default.

Filter Query Insights
---------------------

You can filter the :guilabel:`Query Insights` page by node, node state 
(primary or secondary), and shard. You can also filter by a custom date
range within the last seven days, or select one of the following preset
time ranges:

- 7 days
- 5 days 
- 2 days
- 24 hours (default)
- 12 hours
- 8 hours
- 1 hour

When you apply a filter, {+service+} re-fetches data for the charts and 
table on the current screen. 

.. note:: 

   :ref:`Analytics nodes <add-analytics-node>` are included when you
   filter by secondary node state.

View Metrics in Charts and Tables
---------------------------------

Query Shape Insights displays charts and a table that describe metrics
for query shapes in your project with slow-running queries. 

The Query Shape Insights table contains one row for each top query shape 
in your project, where top query shapes are determined by
highest total execution time. Each row contains the query shape or its
query shape hash, the namespace of the query shape, the query command,
and any metrics that you select to display. You can use the 
:guilabel:`Edit Columns` button to choose which of the
following metrics to include as table columns: 

.. list-table::
  :widths: 20 80
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Metric
    - Description

  * - Total Execution Time
    - Total time in microseconds spent running queries with the given 
      query shape. If the query resulted in :dbcommand:`getMore` 
      commands, this metric includes the time spent processing the 
      :dbcommand:`getMore` requests. This metric does not include time 
      spent waiting for the client. 

  * - Avg Execution Time
    - Average time in microseconds spent running queries with the given 
      query shape. If the query resulted in :dbcommand:`getMore` 
      commands, this metric includes the time spent processing the 
      :dbcommand:`getMore` requests. This metric does not include time 
      spent waiting for the client. 

  * - Execution Count
    - Total number of times that queries with the given query shape 
      have been executed. 

  * - Keys Examined
    - Total number of in-bounds and out-of-bounds index keys examined by
      queries with the given query shape. 

  * - Keys Examined:Returned
    - Ratio of in-bounds and out-of-bounds index keys examined to 
      indexes containing documents returned by queries with the given 
      query shape.   
    
  * - Docs Examined
    - Total number of documents examined by queries with the given query
      shape. 

  * - Docs Returned
    - Total number of documents returned by queries with the given query
      shape. 

  * - Docs Examined:Returned 
    - Ratio of documents examined to documents returned by queries with
      the given query shape.

  * - Total Time to Response
    - Time in microseconds spent from the beginning of query processing
      to the first server response. 

  * - Last Execution Time
    - Execution runtime in microseconds for the most recent query with 
      the given query shape. 

  * - P50 Execution Time
    - 50th percentile in the execution time histogram.

  * - P90 Execution Time
    - 90th percentile in the execution time histogram.

  * - P99 Execution Time 
    - 99th percentile in the execution time histogram.

You can also display charts for one or more of the metrics above by 
selecting each metric that you want to chart from the drop-down menu in
the :guilabel:`Query Shape Statistics` component header.

{+service+} can chart each metric for up to five query shapes at a time. 
By default, {+service+} charts each metric for the five query shapes with 
the highest :guilabel:`Total Execution Time`. You can choose to chart 
different query shapes by selecting or deselecting the checkbox 
in the row of your desired query shapes.
You can manage which query shapes to chart from the table, by selecting 
or deselecting the checkbox in the row of your desired query shapes. 

To view more details about a query shape, click on the row for the query
shape to open the :guilabel:`Query Shape Details` view. This view
contains the full query shape and query shape hash, each table metric
listed above, and the following additional metrics:

- Last Seen Timestamp
- First Seen Timestamp
- Last Seen Application 
- Last Seen Driver Name and Version
- First Seen Application
- First Seen Driver Name and Version

Select Query Shapes to Chart
----------------------------

By default, :guilabel:`Query Shape Insights` displays metric charts for 
the top five query shapes with the highest :guilabel:`Total Execution
Time`. You can select up to five query shapes to chart in the 
:guilabel:`Query Shape Insights` table.

To search for and select query shapes in the :guilabel:`Query Shape
Insights` table: 

.. procedure:: 
   :style: normal 

   .. step:: (Optional) Filter table entries.

      You can filter the :guilabel:`Query Shape Insights` table by the 
      following categories: 

      - **Query Shape**: In the :guilabel:`Search by Query Shape` search 
        box, input the query shape or its associated query hash. 
      - **Namespace**: In the :guilabel:`Select Namespaces` drop-down 
        menu, select one or more namespaces to filter by. 
      - **Command**: In the :guilabel:`Select Commands` drop-down menu,
        select one or more commands to filter by. 
  
   .. step:: (Optional) Change the sort order.

      You can sort the :guilabel:`Query Shape Insights` table by one or
      more metric columns to help identify which query shapes to chart.  

      To sort by a metric in descending or ascending order, click the
      :guilabel:`sort` icon next to the associated column name once or
      twice, respectively. To sort by multiple columns, press
      :kbd:`Shift` and click the :guilabel:`sort` icons in the order in
      which you want to multi-sort the table.
          
   .. step:: Select query shapes. 

      Click the checkbox in the row of your desired query shape.

      You can select up to five query shapes at a time.
