.. _install-windows-server:

Install {+rel-mig+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Log in to the server.

   You can log into the server interactively or using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
   For more information on logging into the server using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP),
   see `Connect to your Windows Instances using RDP <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html#connect-rdp>`__. 

#. Download the {+rel-mig+} ``.msi`` installer. 

   Download the {+rel-mig+} ``.msi`` installer to the target machine or 
   remotely copy it over to the instance. Find the latest {+rel-mig+} 
   installer on the `release page <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator>`__.

#. Launch the installer and follow the local machine :ref:`install instructions <local-machine-install>`. 

#. Enable {+rel-mig+} to run as an unattended server.

   In your ``user.properties`` file, uncomment ``spring.profiles.active: unattended``. 
   Your ``user.properties`` file is located in 
   ``C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\mongodb\{+rel-mig+}\Data``.

#. (Optional) Update TLS/SSL configuration properties.

   In your ``user.properties`` file, uncomment and update TLS/SSL configuration properties.

   It is recommended that the unattended server installation is supplemented with 
   TLS/SSL configuration because {+rel-mig+} can be bound to any IP and port on 
   the server. For additional information, see `TLS/SSL Configuration Properties <https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-skipper/docs/2.8.4/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-security-enabling-https>`__.

#. (Optional) Update the port that {+rel-mig+} runs on.

   By default, {+rel-mig+} is configured to run on port ``8278``.
   To change the port {+rel-mig+} runs on, update the ``server.port`` line 
   in your ``user.properties`` file to specify your preferred port.

#. Run {+rel-mig+} from its installed location or any shortcuts that were 
   created during the installation process. 

#. (Optional) Check logs for errors or other information. 

   - The logs are located in ``C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\mongodb\{+rel-mig+}\Data\Logs``.
 
   - When running {+rel-mig+} as a system service, the path is under the 
     service user’s home directory. The local system user’s profile is located 
     at ``C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile``.

.. _windows-system-service:

Run as a System Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you install {+rel-mig+} on a Windows server, you can set up Relational 
Migrator to run as a system service. When running {+rel-mig+} as a system 
service, {+rel-mig+} automatically starts when the server starts.

1. Launch the Service Manager of your choice.

   These steps use `NSSM <http://nssm.cc/>`__ (a free service manager utility).

#. From a command prompt, run ``.\nssm install RelationalMigrator``.

#. From the :guilabel:`Application` tab, choose the path and startup directory 
   of the installed ``{+mdb-rel-mig+}.exe``.

#. From the :guilabel:`Details` tab, enter :guilabel:`{+mdb-rel-mig+}` 
   as the service’s display name.

#. From the :guilabel:`Log on` tab, keep the default local system account or 
   choose a specific account to run the service under.

#. Click :guilabel:`Install service`.

#. Launch ``services.msc``. 

   Find the newly-installed {+mdb-rel-mig+} service and click 
   :guilabel:`Start Service`. 

   .. note::

      When the startup mode is :guilabel:`Automatic`, the service starts automatically when 
      the computer next restarts.

.. _windows-external-access:

Enable External Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To allow incoming connections on the same port as {+rel-mig+}, 
enable external access with Windows Defender Firewall.

1. Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.

#. Select :guilabel:`Inbound Rules`. Click :guilabel:`New Rule`.

#. Select :guilabel:`Port`. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

#. Select :guilabel:`TCP, Specific Local Ports`, and enter the port number. Click 
   :guilabel:`Next`. 

#. Select :guilabel:`Allow the connection`. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

#. Select the desired network profiles. Click :guilabel:`Next`. 

#. Enter a name for the rule. Click :guilabel:`Finish`.
