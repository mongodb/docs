Overview
--------

The {+php-library+} is a high-level abstraction for the MongoDB PHP extension, which
you can use to connect to MongoDB and interact with data stored in your deployment.
This guide shows you how to create an application that uses the {+php-library+} to
connect to a MongoDB cluster hosted on MongoDB Atlas and query data in your cluster.

.. tip:: 

   MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts your MongoDB
   deployments. You can create your own free (no credit card required) MongoDB Atlas 
   deployment by following the steps in this guide.

Follow this guide to connect a sample PHP application to a MongoDB Atlas
deployment. If you prefer to connect to MongoDB using a different driver or
programming language, see our :driver:`list of official drivers <>`.
