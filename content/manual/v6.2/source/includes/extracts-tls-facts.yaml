   If you specify
   ``--tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` or ``tls.allowInvalidCertificates:
   true`` when using x.509 authentication, an invalid certificate is
   only sufficient to establish a TLS connection but is
   *insufficient* for authentication.

   If ``--tlsCAFile`` or ``tls.CAFile`` is not
   specified and you are not using x.509 authentication, the
   system-wide CA certificate store will be used when connecting to an
   TLS-enabled server.

   If using x.509 authentication, ``--tlsCAFile`` or ``tls.CAFile``
   must be specified unless using :option:`--tlsCertificateSelector <mongod --tlsCertificateSelector>`.

   If ``--tlsCAFile`` or ``tls.CAFile`` is
   not specified, the system-wide CA certificate store will be used
   when connecting to an TLS-enabled server. In previous versions
   of MongoDB, :binary:`~bin.mongosh` exited with an error that
   it could not validate the certificate.

   .. warning::
      
      For TLS connections to :binary:`~bin.mongod` and
      :binary:`~bin.mongos`, avoid using
      ``--tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` if possible and only use
      ``--tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` on systems where intrusion is
      not possible.

      If :binary:`~bin.mongosh` (and other
      :ref:`mongodb-tools-support-tls`) runs with the
      ``--tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` option,
      :binary:`~bin.mongosh` (and other
      :ref:`mongodb-tools-support-tls`) will not attempt to validate
      the server certificates. This creates a vulnerability to expired
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` certificates as
      well as to foreign processes posing as valid
      :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.
      If you only need to disable the validation of the hostname in
      the TLS certificates, see ``--tlsAllowInvalidHostnames``.

   To connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` that
   uses TLS, you must also specify the ``--host`` option to
   :binary:`~bin.mongosh` if you haven't specified a connect
   string. :binary:`~bin.mongosh` verifies that the hostname of
   the :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` matches the CN or
   SAN of ``--tlsCertificateKeyFile`` certificate presented by the
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos`. If the hostname does
   not match the CN/SAN, :binary:`~bin.mongosh` will fail to connect.
