This tutorial covers backing up your snapshots on file system storage.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before creating any file system snapshot stores:

- Attach storage volumes with sufficient capacity to the |onprem| host.
  These volumes store the snapshot files and the
  :term:`Oplog Store <Oplog Store Database>` MongoDB database. The
  Oplog Store doesn't need to be on the same host as the file system
  snapshot store.

- Grant the storage volumes the relevant permissions:

  - On Windows, grant access to the ``SYSTEM`` user.
  - On package-installed Linux distributions, grant access to the
    ``mongodb-mms:mongodb-mms`` user and group.
  - On archive extracted Linux distributions, grant access to the same
    user and group you assigned to the |onprem| installation.

- :doc:`Deploy the dedicated MongoDB instance(s) </tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances>`
  to host the Oplog Stores for this snapshot store.

- Ensure the host running the |onprem| :term:`Backup Daemon` service
  has sufficient capacity to store the :term:`head` database.

- If you use multiple |onprem| instances (including those activated as
  additional Backup Daemons), set up an |nfs| application or something
  similar to ensure the all instances share the same view of file
  system snapshot storage. If the |onprem| instances do not share the
  same view of file system snapshot storage, restores are not possible
  and |onprem| cannot remove expired snapshots.

Once created, file system stores are listed directly on the
:guilabel:`Snapshot Storage` page in a table. Each row contains the
settings for each File System Store.
