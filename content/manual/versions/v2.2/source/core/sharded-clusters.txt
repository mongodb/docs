Sharding is MongoDB’s approach to scaling out. Sharding partitions a
collection and stores the different portions on different machines. When
a database's collections become too large for existing storage, you need only add a
new machine. Sharding automatically distributes collection data to
the new server.

Sharding automatically balances data and load across machines. Sharding
provides additional write capacity by distributing the write load over a
number of :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. Sharding allows users to increase
the potential amount of data in the :term:`working set`.

How Sharding Works
------------------

To run sharding, you set up a sharded cluster. For a description of
sharded clusters, see :doc:`/administration/sharded-clusters`.

Within a sharded cluster, you enable sharding on a per-database basis.
After enabling sharding for a database, you choose which collections to
shard. For each sharded collection, you specify a :term:`shard key`.

The shard key determines the distribution of the collection's
:term:`documents <document>` among the cluster's :term:`shards <shard>`.
The shard key is a :term:`field` that exists in every document in the
collection. MongoDB distributes documents according to ranges of values
in the shard key. A given shard holds documents for which the shard key
falls within a specific range of values. Shard keys, like :term:`indexes
<index>`, can be either a single field or multiple fields.

Within a shard, MongoDB further partitions documents into :term:`chunks
<chunk>`. Each chunk represents a smaller range of values within the
shard's range. When a chunk grows beyond the :ref:`chunk size
<sharding-chunk-size>`, MongoDB :term:`splits <split>` the chunk into
smaller chunks, always based on ranges in the shard key.

Shard Key Selection
-------------------

Choosing the correct shard key can have a great impact on the
performance, capability, and functioning of your database and cluster.
Appropriate shard key choice depends on the schema of your data and the
way that your application queries and writes data to the database.

The ideal shard key:

- is easily divisible which makes it easy for MongoDB to distribute
  content among the shards. Shard keys that have a limited number of
  possible values are not ideal as they can result in some chunks that
  are "unsplitable." See the :ref:`sharding-shard-key-cardinality`
  section for more information.

- will distribute write operations among the cluster, to prevent any
  single shard from becoming a bottleneck. Shard keys that have a high
  correlation with insert time are poor choices for this reason;
  however, shard keys that have higher "randomness" satisfy this
  requirement better. See the :ref:`sharding-shard-key-write-scaling`
  section for additional background.

- will make it possible for the :binary:`~bin.mongos` to return most query
  operations directly from a single *specific* :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  instance. Your shard key should be the primary field used by your
  queries, and fields with a high degree of "randomness" are poor
  choices for this reason. See the :ref:`sharding-shard-key-query-isolation`
  section for specific examples.

The challenge when selecting a shard key is that there is not always
an obvious choice. Often, an existing field in your collection may not be
the optimal key. In those situations, computing a special purpose
shard key into an additional field or using a compound shard key may
help produce one that is more ideal.

.. important:: Shard keys are immutable and cannot be changed after
   insertion.

.. index:: balancing
.. _sharding-balancing:

Shard Balancing
---------------

Balancing is the process MongoDB uses to redistribute data within a
:term:`sharded cluster`. When a :term:`shard` has too many
:term:`chunks <chunk>` when compared to other shards, MongoDB
automatically balances the shards. MongoDB balances the shards without
intervention from the application layer.

The balancing process attempts to minimize the impact that balancing can
have on the cluster, by:

- Moving only one chunk at a time.

- Initiating a balancing round **only** when the difference in the number of
  chunks between the shard with the greatest number and the shard with the
  lowest exceeds the :ref:`migration threshold
  <sharding-migration-thresholds>`.

You may disable the balancer on a temporary basis for
maintenance and limit the window during which it runs to prevent the
balancing process from impacting production traffic.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer` and
   :doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-internals`.

.. note::

   The balancing procedure for :term:`sharded clusters <sharded cluster>`
   is entirely transparent to the user and application layer. This
   documentation is only included for your edification and possible
   troubleshooting purposes.

When to Use Sharding
--------------------

While sharding is a powerful and compelling feature, it comes with
significant :ref:`sharding-requirements-infrastructure`
and some limited complexity costs. As a result, use
sharding only as necessary, and when indicated by actual operational
requirements. Consider the following overview of indications it may be
time to consider sharding.

You should consider deploying a :term:`sharded cluster`, if:

- your data set approaches or exceeds the storage capacity of a single
  node in your system.

- the size of your system's active :term:`working set` *will soon*
  exceed the capacity of the *maximum* amount of RAM for your system.

- your system has a large amount of write activity, a single
  MongoDB instance cannot write data fast enough to meet demand, and
  all other approaches have not reduced contention.

If these attributes are not present in your system, sharding will only
add additional complexity to your system without providing much
benefit. When designing your data model, if you will eventually need a
sharded cluster, consider which collections you will want to shard and
the corresponding shard keys.

.. _sharding-capacity-planning:

.. warning::

   It takes time and resources to deploy sharding, and if your system
   has *already* reached or exceeded its capacity, you will have a
   difficult time deploying sharding without impacting your
   application.

   As a result, if you think you will need to partition your database
   in the future, **do not** wait until your system is overcapacity to
   enable sharding.

.. _sharding-requirements-infrastructure:

Infrastructure Requirements for Sharded Clusters
------------------------------------------------

A :term:`sharded cluster` has the following components:

- Three :term:`config servers <config database>`.

  These special :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances store the metadata for the
  cluster. The :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances cache this data and use it
  to determine which :term:`shard` is responsible for which
  :term:`chunk`.

  For development and testing purposes you may deploy a cluster with a single
  configuration server process, but always use exactly three config
  servers for redundancy and safety in production.

- Two or more shards. Each shard consists of one or more :binary:`~bin.mongod`
  instances that store the data for the shard.

  These "normal" :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances hold all of the
  actual data for the cluster.

  Typically each shard is a :term:`replica sets <replica set>`. Each
  replica set consists of multiple :binary:`~bin.mongod` instances. The members
  of the replica set provide redundancy and high available for the data in each shard.

  .. warning::

     MongoDB enables data :term:`partitioning <partition>`, or
     sharding, on a *per collection* basis. You *must* access all data
     in a sharded cluster via the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances as below.
     If you connect directly to a :binary:`~bin.mongod` in a sharded cluster
     you will see its fraction of the cluster's data. The data on any
     given shard may be somewhat random: MongoDB provides no guarantee
     that any two contiguous chunks will reside on a single shard.

- One or more :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances.

  These instance direct queries from the application layer to the
  shards that hold the data. The :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances have no
  persistent state or data files and only cache metadata in RAM from
  the config servers.

  .. note::

     In most situations :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances use minimal
     resources, and you can run them on your application servers
     without impacting application performance. However, if you use
     the :term:`aggregation framework` some processing may occur on
     the :binary:`~bin.mongos` instances, causing that :binary:`~bin.mongos`
     to require more system resources.

.. _sharding-requirements-data:

Data Quantity Requirements for Sharded Clusters
-----------------------------------------------

Your cluster must manage a significant quantity of data for sharding
to have an effect on your collection. The default :term:`chunk` size
is 64 megabytes, and the :ref:`balancer
<sharding-balancing>` will not begin moving data until the imbalance
of chunks in the cluster exceeds the :ref:`migration threshold
<sharding-migration-thresholds>`.

Practically, this means that unless your cluster has many hundreds of
megabytes of data, chunks will remain on a single shard.

While there are some exceptional situations where you may need to
shard a small collection of data, most of the time the additional
complexity added by sharding the small collection is not worth the additional
complexity and overhead unless
you need additional concurrency or capacity for some reason. If you
have a small data set, usually a properly configured
single MongoDB instance or replica set will be more than sufficient
for your persistence layer needs.

:term:`Chunk <chunk>` size is :option:`user configurable <mongos --chunkSize>`.
However, the default value is of 64 megabytes is ideal
for most deployments. See the :ref:`sharding-chunk-size` section in the
:doc:`/core/sharded-cluster-internals` document for more information.
