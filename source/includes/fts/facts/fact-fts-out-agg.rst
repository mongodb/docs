   If you use the :manual:`$out </reference/operator/aggregation/out>`
   aggregation stage to modify a collection with an existing |fts| index, 
   you must delete and re-create the search index. If possible,
   consider using :manual:`$merge </reference/operator/aggregation/merge>`
   instead of ``$out``.
