"Maintaining a secure MongoDB deployment requires administrators to implement"
" controls to ensure that users and applications have access to only the data"

"implement these controls and restrictions for any MongoDB deployment."

"MongoDB supports a number of :ref:`authentication mechanisms <security-"

msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/security-introduction.txt:38
msgid ""
"Access control, i.e. :doc:`authorization </core/authorization>`, determines "
"a user's access to resources and operations. Clients should only be able to "

"compromised application."

"MongoDB's role-based access control system allows administrators to control "
"all access and ensure that all granted access applies as narrowly as "
"possible. MongoDB does not enable authorization by default. When you enable "
":doc:`authorization </core/authorization>`, MongoDB will require "
"authentication for all connections."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/core/security-introduction.txt:50
msgid ""
"When authorization is enabled, MongoDB controls a user's access through the "
