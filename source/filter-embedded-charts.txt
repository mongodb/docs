You can customize your embedded charts by appending various
query parameters to their iframe URLs or using the ``filter`` option 
with the |charts-short| Embedding SDK.

.. note::

   To embed charts from your dashboards, you must configure embedding
   options on your data sources. For instructions, see:
   
   - :ref:`embedding-charts`

.. _specify-filter-fields:

Specify Filterable Fields
-------------------------

A chart :ref:`Author <dashboard-roles>` specifies the fields that can be
included in filters set by the embedding application code or added by
chart viewers. A chart author can limit access to data by allowing only 
certain fields to be filtered. By default, no fields are allowed, 
meaning the chart cannot be filtered until you explicitly allow at 
least one field.

To define filterable fields:

1. Navigate to the :ref:`dashboard <dashboards>` that contains the chart
   where you wish to define filterable fields.

#. For the desired chart, click the :icon-fa5:`ellipsis-h` button and
   select :guilabel:`Embed Chart` from the dropdown.

#. In the :guilabel:`User Specified Filters` section, use the
   dropdown to select which fields chart viewers can use filter data
   in the chart. You can also manually type values to add fields not
   listed in the dropdown.

   .. note::

      This option only appears if you already have **Unauthenticated** 
      or **Authenticated** embedding access enabled.

#. When you have selected all desired fields, click :guilabel:`Save`
   below the dropdown.

Chart :ref:`viewers <dashboard-roles>` and applications which render
the chart can now use filters based on the specified fields to
display subsets of the original chart data. If a viewer attempts to
use a filter for a field not included in the :ref:`User Specified Filters <specify-filter-fields>` list, an
:ref:`error <embedded-errors>` is returned.

Filters for Embedded Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you add a field to the :guilabel:`User Specified Filters` list 
whose value is an embedded document, you must also specify each 
individual sub-field you wish to allow.

.. example::

  Consider the following document:

  .. code-block:: json

      {
        "name": "Alice",
        "favorites" : 
        {
          "color": "green",
          "animal": "turtle",
          "season": "autumn"
        } 
      }

If you only add the ``favorites`` field to the list of allowed fields, it does
*not* grant viewers permission to filter upon any of the sub-fields
of ``favorites``. Instead, you may add one or more of the sub-fields
to the list individually by specifying ``favorites.color``,
``favorites.animal``, or ``favorites.season``.

.. _embed-options-filter:

Filter Data on Charts Embedded in an iframe
-------------------------------------------

Use the ``filter`` query parameter to only display data that matches a 
specified :abbr:`MQL (MongoDB Query Language)` filter in your
chart embedded in an iframe. 

You can use the ``filter`` query parameter on both 
:guilabel:`Unauthenticated`
and :guilabel:`Verified Signature` charts. The filtering
behavior differs with each authentication setting:

- With unauthenticated charts, the chart
  :ref:`Author <dashboard-roles>` specifies the fields that can be
  included in filters set by the embedding application code or added by
  chart viewers. To learn how to specify filterable fields, see
  :ref:`Specify Filterable Fields <specify-filter-fields>`.

- With charts which require a Verified Signature, all document
  fields can be filtered upon, however you must generate
  the filter in the server-side code and include the filter as part of
  your signed payload.

Filter Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select the appropriate tab to see an example of how to filter data in
an :guilabel:`Unauthenticated` chart and a 
:guilabel:`Verified Signature` chart:

.. tabs::

   tabs:
     - id: unauthenticated
       name: Unauthenticated External Sharing
       content: |

         You can specify an MQL document as your ``filter`` query
         parameter provided that the fields used in your filter are in
         the :ref:`list of allowed filterable fields <specify-filter-fields>`.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-embedded-filter-examples-unauth.rst

         .. note::

            You must URL-encode special characters of the filter
            parameter.

         Example
         ```````

         The following iframe ``src`` URL renders a chart which only
         displays documents with an ``imdb.rating`` greater than or
         equal to ``8``:

         .. code-block:: none
            :emphasize-lines: 3

            https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-atlasproject1-piocy/embed/charts?
            id=93584ddb-1115-4a12-afd9-5129e47bbb0d&
            filter={"imdb.rating":%20{$gte:%208}}&
            autoRefresh=30

         The URL uses an encoded ``filter`` parameter of
         ``{"imdb.rating":%20{$gte:%208}}``. Decoded,
         this filter is:

         .. code-block:: json

            {"imdb.rating": {$gte: 8}}

     - id: verified-signature
       name: Verified Signature Required
       content: |

         Specify an MQL document as your ``filter`` query parameter.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-embedded-filter-examples-verified.rst

         When using filters in a Verified Signature, MQL queries contain
         characters that must be URL-encoded before your server-side
         code calculates the signature. When |charts-short| verifies the
         signature, it URL-encodes the filter again using the JavaScript
         `encodeURIComponent
         <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent>`__
         function. You must use the same encoding algorithm to encode
         your filter.

         .. important::

            You must encode spaces in your filter as ``%20``, rather than ``+``
            or a raw space.

         To see how correctly encode an MQL filter using different server-side
         programming languages, see `MongoDB Charts Embedding Examples
         <https://github.com/mongodb/charts-embedding-examples>`__ on GitHub.

         Example
         ```````

         The following iframe ``src`` URL renders a chart which only
         displays documents with an ``imdb.rating`` greater than or
         equal to ``8``:

         .. code-block:: none
            :emphasize-lines: 5

            https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-atlasproject1-piocy/embed/charts?
            id=93584ddb-1115-4a12-afd9-5129e47bbb0d&
            timestamp=1564156636&
            expires-in=300&
            filter=%7B%22imdb.rating%22%3A%20%7B%24gte%3A%208%7D%7D&
            autoRefresh=30&
            signature=8e0d92b33934c928f6c6974e2f0102ace77f56d851cb0d33893e84c359ab1043

         The URL uses an encoded ``filter`` parameter of
         ``%7B%22imdb.rating%22%3A%20%7B%24gte%3A%208%7D%7D``. Decoded,
         this filter is:

         .. code-block:: json

            {"imdb.rating": {$gte: 8}}

.. _filter-embedded-sdk:

Filter Data on Charts Embedded with the SDK
-------------------------------------------

You can add a :ref:`filter <embed-options-filter>` to an embedded chart
with the ``filter`` option. Filtering allows the chart author to only display
data in the embedded chart which matches a specified :abbr:`MQL (MongoDB
Query Language)` filter.

Any fields included in the filter must be specified in the Embed Chart modal.
The Embed Chart modal contains a dropdown menu of fields on
which to allow filtering.

The following uses the ``filter`` option to represent only documents in
which the ``total`` field is greater than ``100``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   createChart({
     baseUrl: '<your-base-url>',
     chartId: '<your-chart-id>',
     width: 500,
     height: 500,
     filter: { "total": { "$gt": 100 } }
   })

.. _inject-filter-per-user:

Inject User-Specific Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you embed a chart that requires :guilabel:`Authenticated` access, 
you can use the :guilabel:`Inject Filter Per User` setting to inject a 
MongoDB filter document specific to each user who views 
the chart. The function has access to your Embedding Authentication 
Provider's token via ``context.token``, and can filter the chart data 
based on the token.

This filter ensures that viewers of an embedded chart see only their
own data, which is useful when embedding charts with potentially
sensitive information.

To inject a filter specific to each user, in the 
:guilabel:`Authenticated` tab of the the :guilabel:`Embed Chart` 
dialog, set the :guilabel:`Inject Filter Per User`
setting to :guilabel:`On`. Specify a function and click 
:guilabel:`Save`.
