The first step in the :ref:`schema design process
<data-modeling-schema-design>` is to identify the operations that your
application runs most frequently. Knowing your application's most common
queries helps you create effective indexes and minimize the number of
calls the application makes to the database.

About this Task
---------------

When you consider your application's workload, consider the scenarios
your application currently supports and scenarios it may support in the
future. Design your schema to function in all stages of your application
development.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Identify the data your application needs

      To identify the data that your application needs, consider the
      following factors:

      - Your application's users and the information they need.
      - Your business domain.
      - Application logs and frequently-run queries. To see database
        commands run on a MongoDB deployment, see
        :ref:`database-profiler`.

   .. step:: Create a workload table with your application's queries

      Fill out the following table with the queries that your
      application needs to run:

      .. list-table::
         :header-rows: 1
         :widths: 10 10 10 10 10

         * - Action
           - Query Type
           - Information
           - Frequency
           - Priority

         * - The action that a user takes to trigger the query.
         
           - The type of query (read or write).

           - The document fields that are either written or returned by
             the query.

           - How frequently your application runs the query.
           
             Queries that are run frequently benefit from indexes and
             should be optimized to avoid lookup operations.

           - How critical the query is to your application.

Example
-------

The following example shows a workload table for a blog application:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 10 10 10 10

   * - Action
     - Type
     - Information
     - Frequency
     - Priority

   * - Submit a new article
     - Write
     - author, text
     - 10 per day
     - High

   * - Submit a comment on an article
     - Write
     - user, text
     - 1,000 per day (100 per article)
     - Medium

   * - View an article 
     - Read
     - article id, text, comments
     - 1,000,000 per day
     - High

   * - View article analytics
     - Read
     - article id, comments, clicks
     - 10 per hour
     - Low 

Next Steps
----------

After you identify your application's workload, the next step in the
schema design process is to map related data in your schema. See
:ref:`data-modeling-map-relationships`.
