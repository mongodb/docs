Monitoring
----------

Alerts
~~~~~~

For information on creating and managing alerts, see
:doc:`/tutorial/create-alert` and
:doc:`/tutorial/manage-alerts-and-events`.

Cannot Turn Off Email Notifications
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are at least two ways to turn off alert notifications:

Remove the host from your MMS account. Click the :guilabel:`Monitoring`
tab, then :guilabel:`Deployment`, and then the :guilabel:`gear icon` to
the right of the host name. Then select :guilabel:`Remove Host`.

Disable or delete the alert in MMS. Click the :guilabel:`Activity` tab then
click :guilabel:`Alert Settings`. To the right of an alert, select the
:guilabel:`gear icon` and select :guilabel:`Disable` or :guilabel:`Delete`.

Receive Duplicate Alerts
++++++++++++++++++++++++

If the notification email list contains multiple email-groups, one or more
people may receive multiple notifications of the same alert.

.. _open-file-limits:

Receive "Host has low open file limits" or "Too many open files" error messages
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

These error messages appear on the :guilabel:`Deployment` page,
under a host's name. They appear if the number of
available connections does not meet an MMS-defined minimum value. These errors
are not generated by the :program:`mongos` instance and, therefore, will not
appear in :program:`mongos` log files.

On a host by host basis, the Monitoring Agent compares the number of open
file descriptors and connections to the maximum connections limit. The max open
file descriptors ulimit parameter directly affects the number of available
server connections. The agent calculates whether or not enough connections
exist to meet an MMS-defined minimum value.

In ping documents, for each node and its ``serverStatus.connections`` values,
if the sum of the ``current`` value plus the ``available`` value is less than
the ``maxConns`` configuration value set for a monitored host, the Monitoring
Agent will send a :guilabel:`Host has low open file limits` or :guilabel:`Too
many open files` message to MMS.

Ping documents are data sent by Monitoring Agents to MMS. To view ping
documents, click the :guilabel:`Deployment` page, then click the host's
name, and then click :guilabel:`Last Ping`.

To prevent this error, we recommend you set ``ulimit`` open files to 64000. We
also recommend setting the ``maxConns`` command in the mongo shell to at least
the recommended settings.

See :manual:`the MongoDB ulimit reference page </reference/ulimit>` and the
:manual:`the MongoDB maxConns reference page
</reference/configuration-options/#maxConns>` for details.

Hosts
~~~~~

Hosts are not Visible
+++++++++++++++++++++

Problems with the Monitoring Agent detecting hosts can be caused by a few
factors.

**Host not added to MMS**: In MMS, select the :guilabel:`Monitoring tab, then
select `:guilabel:`Deployment`, and then click
the :guilabel:`Add Host` button. In the :guilabel:`New Host` window, specify
the host type, internal hostname, and port. If appropriate, add the database
username and password and whether or not MMS should use SSL to connect with
your Monitoring Agent. Note it is not necessary to restart your Monitoring
Agent when adding (or removing) a host.

**Accidental duplicate mongods** If you add the host after a crash and restart
the Monitoring Agent, you might not see the hostname on the MMS
:guilabel:`Deployment` page. MMS detects the host as a duplicate and suppresses its
data. To reset, select the :guilabel:`Settings` tab, then :guilabel:`Group Settings`,
and then the :guilabel:`Reset Duplicates` button.

**Too many Monitoring Agents installed**: Only one Monitoring Agent is needed
to monitor all hosts within a single network. You can use a single Monitoring
Agent if your hosts exist across multiple data centers and can be discovered by
a single agent. Check you have only one Monitoring Agent and remove old agents
after upgrading the Monitoring Agent.

A second Monitoring Agent can be set up for redundancy. However, the MMS
Monitoring Agent is robust. MMS sends an *Agent Down* alert only when there are
no available Monitoring Agents available. See :ref:`Monitoring FAQ
<faq-monitoring>` and :doc:`Monitoring Architecture
</tutorial/add-hosts-to-monitoring>` for more information.

Cannot Delete a Host
++++++++++++++++++++

In rare cases, the :program:`mongod` is brought down and the replica set is
reconfigured. The down host cannot be deleted and returns an error message,
"This host cannot be deleted because it is enabled for backup." `Contact MMS
Support <https://mms.mongodb.com/links/support>`_ for help in deleting these
hosts.

For more information on deleted hosts, see :ref:`removing-hosts`.

Groups
~~~~~~

For information on creating and managing groups, see
:ref:`manage-groups`.

Cannot Delete a Group
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. include:: /includes/fact-remove-group.rst

How to Add a Group
++++++++++++++++++

Create a group to monitor additional segregated systems or environments for
servers, agents, users, and other resources. For example, your deployment might
have two or more environments separated by firewalls. In this case, you would
need two or more separate MMS groups.

API and shared secret keys are unique to each group. Each group requires its
own agent with the appropriate API and shared secret keys. Within each group,
the agent needs to be able to connect to all hosts it monitors in the group.

.. include:: /includes/steps/add-group.rst

See :doc:`User and Environment Management </tutorial/manage-users/>` for
more details.

.. _troubleshooting-munin:

Munin
~~~~~

Install and configure the ``munin-node`` daemon on the monitored MongoDB
server(s) before starting MMS monitoring. The MMS agent README file provides
guidelines to install ``munin-node``. However, new versions of Linux,
specifically Red Hat Linux (RHEL) 6, can generate error messages. See
:doc:`/tutorial/configure-monitoring-munin-node/` for details about
monitoring hardware with ``munin-node``.

Restart ``munin-node`` after creating links for changes to take effect.

"No package munin-node is available" Error
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To correct this error, install the most current version of the Linux repos.
Type these commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo yum install http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

Then type this command to install ``munin-node`` and all dependencies:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo yum install munin-node

Non-localhost IP Addresses are Blocked
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, munin blocks incoming connections from non-localhost IP addresses.
The ``/var/log/munin/munin-node.log`` file will display a
"Denying connection" error for your non-localhost IP address.

To fix this error, open the ``munin-node.conf`` configuration file and comment
out these two lines:

.. code-block:: sh

   allow ^127\.0\.0\.1$
   allow ^::1$

Then add this line to the ``munin-node.conf`` configuration file with a pattern
that matches your subnet:

.. code-block:: sh

   cidr_allow 0.0.0.0/0

Restart ``munin-node`` after editing the configuration file for changes to take effect.

Verifying iostat and Other Plugins/Services Returns "# Unknown service" Error
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The first step is to confirm there is a problem. Open a telnet session and
connect to ``iostat``, ``iostat_ios``, and ``cpu``:

.. code-block:: sh

   telnet HOSTNAME 4949 <default/required munin port>
   fetch iostat
   fetch iostat_ios
   fetch cpu

The ``iostat_ios`` plugin creates the ``iotime`` chart, and the ``cpu``
plugin creates the ``cputime`` chart.

If any of these telnet ``fetch`` commands returns an "# Unknown Service" error,
create a link to the plugin or service in /etc/munin/plugins/ by typing these
commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd /etc/munin/plugins/
   sudo ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/<service> <service>

Replace ``<service>`` with the name of the service that generates the error.

Disk names are not listed by Munin
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In some cases, Munin will omit disk names with a dash between the name and a
numerical prefix, for example, ``dm-0`` or ``dm-1``. There is `a documented fix`_ for
Munin's iostat plugin.

.. _`a documented fix`: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/munin/+bug/493982

Authentication
--------------

Two-Factor Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Missed SMS Authentication Tokens
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Unfortunately SMS is not a 100% reliable delivery mechanism for messages,
especially across international borders. The Google authentication option is
100% reliable. Unless you must use SMS for authentication, use the
Google Authenticator application for two-factor authentication.

If you do not receive the SMS authentication tokens:

1. Refer to the :doc:`Settings </core/settings/>`
   page for more details about using two-factor authentication. This
   page includes any limitations which may affect SMS delivery times.

2. Enter the SMS phone number with country code first followed by the
   area code and the phone number. Also try 011 first followed by
   the country code, then area code, and then the phone number.

If you do not receive the authentication token in a reasonable amount
of time `contact MMS Support <https://mms.mongodb.com/links/support>`_ to
rule out SMS message delivery delays.

How to Delete or Reset Two-Factor Authentication
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. only:: classic or cloud

   `Contact MMS Support <https://mms.mongodb.com/links/support>`_ to delete or
   reset any two-factor authentications you have configured.

.. only:: onprem

   Contact your system administrator to remove or reset two-factor
   authentication on your account.

   For administrative information on two-factor authentication, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/manage-two-factor-authentication`.

.. only:: onprem

   LDAP
   ~~~~

   Cannot Enable LDAP
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   You must enable LDAP **before** you sign up the first user through the MMS
   interface, as required in :ref:`Authentication Requirements
   <authentication-requirements>`. If you cannot enable LDAP because you have
   created a user through MMS, you must reinstall MMS, being sure to enable
   LDAP before creating users and hosts. Please see :ref:`Authentication
   Requirements <authentication-requirements>`.

   Forgot to Change MONGODB-CR Error
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   If your MongoDB deployment uses LDAP for authentication, and you find
   the following error message:

   .. code-block:: none

      You forget to change "MONGODB-CR" to "LDAP (PLAIN)" since they both
      take username/password.

   Then make sure that you specified the ``LDAP (PLAIN)`` as is the
   authentication mechanism for both the Monitoring Agent and the Backup
   Agent. See :ref:`security-ldap`.

   Backup
   ------

   Logs Display MongodVersionException
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The ``MongodVersionException`` can occur if the :ref:`Backup Daemon's
   <backup-daemon>` host cannot access the internet to download the
   version or versions of MongoDB required for the backed-up databases.
   Each database requires a version of MongoDB that matches the database's
   version.

   If the Daemon runs without access to the internet, you must manually
   download the required MongoDB versions, as described here:

   1. Go to the `MongoDB downloads page <http://www.mongodb.org/downloads>`_
      and download the appropriate versions for your environment.

   2. Copy the download to the Daemon's host.

   3. Decompress the download into the directory specified in the
      :setting:`mongodb.release.directory` setting in the Daemon's
      ``conf-daemon.properties`` file, located in
      ``/opt/mongodb/mms-backup-daemon/conf/``.

      Within the directory specified in the
      :setting:`mongodb.release.directory` setting, the folder structure
      for MongoDB should look like the following:

      .. code-block:: sh

         <path-to-mongodb-release-directory>/
         |-- mongodb-<platform>
         |  |-- THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES
         |  |-- README
         |  |-- GNU-AGPL-3.0
         |  |-- bin

   System
   ------

   Logs Display OutOfMemoryError
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   If your logs display ``OutOfMemoryError``, ensure you are running with
   sufficient ulimits and RAM.

   Increase Ulimits
   ++++++++++++++++

   For the recommended ulimit setting, see the FAQ on
   :ref:`open-file-limits`.

   MMS infers the host's ``ulimit`` setting using the total number of
   available and current connections. For more information about ulimits
   in MongoDB, see the :manual:`UNIX ulimit Settings </reference/ulimit/>`
   reference page.

   Ensure Sufficient RAM for All Components
   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   - Ensure that each server has enough RAM for the components it runs. If
     a server runs multiple components, its RAM must be at least the sum
     of the required amount of RAM for **each** component.

     For the RAM requirements for the MMS Application Server and,
     separately, for the MMS Backup Daemon Server, see
     :doc:`/core/requirements`.

     For the RAM requirements for the MMS Application Database and,
     separately, for the MMS Backup Blockstore Database, see
     :doc:`/tutorial/prepare-backing-mongodb-instances`.
