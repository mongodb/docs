Install MongoDB on Ubuntu
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

Use this tutorial to install MongoDB on Ubuntu Linux systems. The tutorial
uses ``.deb`` packages to install. While Ubuntu includes its own MongoDB
packages, the official MongoDB packages are generally more up-to-date.

.. note::

   If you use an older Ubuntu that does **not** use Upstart (i.e. any
   version before 9.10 "Karmic"), please follow the instructions on the
   :doc:`install-mongodb-on-debian` tutorial.

.. The following include includes two h2 headers:
.. Packages and Control Scripts

.. |init-script-path| replace:: ``/etc/init.d/mongod``

.. include:: /includes/list-mongodb-org-packages.rst

Considerations
--------------

For production deployments, always run MongoDB on 64-bit systems.

You cannot install this package concurrently with the ``mongodb``,
``mongodb-server``, or ``mongodb-clients`` packages provided by Ubuntu.

.. versionchanged:: 2.6

   The package structure and names have changed as of version 2.6. For
   instructions on installation of an older release, please navigate to the
   appropriate version in the Options menu at the lower left.

Run MongoDB
-----------

The MongoDB instance stores its data files in ``/var/lib/mongodb``
and its log files in ``/var/log/mongodb``, and runs using the ``mongodb``
user account. If you change the user that runs the MongoDB process, you
**must** modify the access control rights to the ``/var/lib/mongodb`` and
``/var/log/mongodb`` directories.
