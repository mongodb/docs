Business Intelligence tools connect to a data source and, given a fixed
tabular schema, allow the user to visually explore their data. However,
because MongoDB uses a :manual:`flexible schema </data-modeling>`, these tools
currently cannot use MongoDB as a native data source.

To use MongoDB with a relational business intelligence tool such as Tableau,
you must define a relational mapping for your MongoDB data.

The schema generation tool :program:`mongodrdl` will output such a schema in the
:ref:`Document Relational Definition Language <drdl>` (DRDL) format, but you
should verify that the schema it proposes matches your data requirements.
Examine both the table structure and field types to ensure that you will be
able to generate your desired reports.

You may have to edit the schema definition files by hand to remove unneeded
fields; add fields that :program:`mongodrdl` did not discover within the subset
of documents that it sampled; and modify erroneous field types.

You may edit DRDL files in the following ways:

- Add :ref:`aggregation pipeline <aggregation-pipeline>` stages,
- Add fields,
- Remove fields,
- Remove tables,
- Rename tables, so long as the ``collection`` field remains the same,
- Rename fields using the ``sqlname`` option

Document Relational Definition Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Document Relational Definition Language (``DRDL``) defines a
relational view of a MongoDB schema.

:program:`mongodrdl` samples documents from your MongoDB collections, and
derives a ``DRDL`` file from those documents. :program:`mongosqld` then
uses the schema defined in ``DRDL`` files to allow MySQL clients to
query your MongoDB data.

File Format
```````````

Using the `YAML <http://yaml.org/>`_ format, the ``DRDL`` file lists the
databases, tables, and columns to be "exported" for use in Business
Intelligence tools.

.. code-block:: yaml

   schema:
   - db: <database name>
     tables:
     - table: <SQL table name>
       collection: <MongoDB collection name>
       pipeline:
       - <optional pipeline elements>
       columns:
       - Name: <MongoDB field name>
         MongoType: <MongoDB field type>
         SqlName: <mapped SQL column name>
         SqlType: <mapped SQL column type>

Example
```````

.. include:: /includes/fact-mongodrdl-example.rst

Field Types
~~~~~~~~~~~

The |bi| will correctly map fields that always contain the same data type into
the relational model. Schema generation will deal specially with the following cases:

Dates
  The connector will treat any field of type :bsontype:`data_date` as the
  :term:`SQL` ``timestamp`` type.

Timestamps
  The connector will treat any field of type :bsontype:`data_timestamp` as a
  ``varchar`` string type.

Geospatial
  .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

  If a collection contains a
  :manual:`geospatial index </applications/geospatial-indexes>`, the connector will
  map the indexed field into an array of numeric longitude-latitude coordinates.

  See :ref:`bi-geospatial` for an example.

  .. include:: /includes/fact-geospatial-views.rst

.. _drdl-heterogeneous:

Heterogeneous Fields
  If a field contains inconsistent types, the |bi| has undefined behavior
  when dealing with that field.

  If a field can contain either a type or an array of that type, the
  generated schema will always specify that the field contains an array.

  .. seealso::

     :ref:`bi-skip-incompatible-types`

Embedded Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |bi| will map embedded documents to simple fields
that have a ``.`` separator character, making them appear similar to the way you
would reference them using :ref:`dot notation <document-dot-notation>` in a
MongoDB query.

While Tableau properly quotes identifiers, within "ad-hoc"
SQL expressions you must double-quote every identifier that contains ``.``
characters or mixed-case characters.

For example, consider the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "_id": 1,
       "familyName": "Partridge",
       "hometown" : "Hollywood Hills",
       "address" : { "street": "123 Main Street",
                     "city" : "Hollywood",
                     "state" : "CA",
                     "zip" : "90210" },
       "members_since" : ISODate("2002-04-12T00:00:00Z")
   }

This will result in the following fields in the generated schema:

.. list-table::

   * - ``_id``

     - ``numeric``

   * - ``familyName``

     - ``varchar``

   * - ``hometown``

     - ``varchar``

   * - ``address.street``

     - ``varchar``

   * - ``address.city``

     - ``varchar``

   * - ``address.state``

     - ``varchar``

   * - ``address.zip``

     - ``varchar``

   * - ``members_since``

     - ``timestamp``

Arrays
~~~~~~

|bi| exposes arrays to business intelligence tools using two
collections: one without the array, and the other having one document
per array element.

For example, consider the following document in the collection
``families``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id": 1,
      "familyName": "Partridge",
      "hometown" : "Hollywood Hills",
      "familyMembers" : [
        {
            "firstname" : "Shirley",
            "age" : 42,
            "attributes" : [
                { "name" : "instrument", "value" : "singer" },
                { "name" : "role", "value" : "mom" }
            ]
        },
        {
            "firstname" : "Keith",
            "age" : 18,
            "attributes" : [
                { "name" : "instrument", "value" : "guitar" },
                { "name" : "role", "value" : "son" }
            ]
        },
        {
            "firstname" : "Laurie",
            "age" : 16,
            "attributes" : [
                { "name" : "instrument", "value" : "keyboard" },
                { "name" : "role", "value" : "sister" }
            ]
        }]
   }

This will result in the following three tables:

``families``
  .. list-table::

     * - ``_id``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyName``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``hometown``

       - ``varchar``

``families_familyMembers``
  .. list-table::

     * - ``_id``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyMembers.age``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyMembers.firstname``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``familyMembers_idx``

       - ``numeric``

``families_familyMembers_attributes``
  .. list-table::

     * - ``_id``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyMembers.attributes.name``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``familyMembers.attributes.value``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``familyMembers.attributes_idx``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyMembers_idx``

       - ``numeric``

You can join these tables together to view the data in a denormalized
format. For example, you can list the people named in the above schema
together with their family information using the following query:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT f.*, m.`familyMembers.firstname` FROM families_familyMembers m JOIN families f ON m._id = f._id;

Pre-Joining
```````````

If you provide the :option:`--preJoined` option to :program:`mongodrdl`,
then the |bi| will add the fields in the containing document to each
array element's document, thus "pre-joining" the table.

In the previous example, the tables would contain the following
additional columns:

``families_familyMembers``
  .. list-table::

     * - ``familyName``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``hometown``

       - ``varchar``

``families_familyMembers_attributes``
  .. list-table::

     * - ``familyMembers.age``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyMembers.firstname``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``familyMembers_idx``

       - ``numeric``

     * - ``familyName``

       - ``varchar``

     * - ``hometown``

       - ``varchar``

Custom Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add a column of type ``mongo.Filter`` to a collection in your
``DRDL`` file. This column type allows you to perform a custom
:manual:`$match </reference/operator/aggregation/$match>` query.

For example, given the following schema describing a cloud of points with
up to three components:

.. code-block:: yaml

   schema:
   - db: test
     tables:
     - table: points
       collection: points
       pipeline: []
       columns:
       - Name: _id
         MongoType: bson.ObjectId
         SqlName: _id
         SqlType: varchar
       - Name: x
         MongoType: float64
         SqlName: x
         SqlType: numeric
       - Name: "y"
         MongoType: float64
         SqlName: "y"
         SqlType: numeric
       - Name: z
         MongoType: float64
         SqlName: z
         SqlType: numeric
       - Name: filter
         MongoType: mongo.Filter
         SqlName: filter
         SqlType: varchar

You can select only three-dimensional points using the following query:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT x, y, z FROM points WHERE filter='{"z": {"$exists": true}}';

.. _bi-pipeline:

Aggregation Pipelines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aggregation Pipelines using Views
`````````````````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/fact-pipeline-views.rst

Aggregation Pipelines in DRDL
`````````````````````````````

The |bi| can use :ref:`aggregation pipelines <aggregation-pipeline>` as
part of the schema to transform documents from the collection into the
proper form for the relational tables.

For example, consider a simple document in the collection
``simpleFamilies``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id": 1,
      "familyName": "Partridge",
      "familyMembers" : [ "Shirley", "Keith", "Laurie"]
   }


:program:`mongodrdl` will generate a schema with the tables
``simpleFamilies`` and ``simpleFamilies_familyMembers``.

The table ``simpleFamilies_familyMembers`` enumerates each family
members, and has the following pipeline:

.. code-block:: yaml

   pipeline:
   - $unwind:
       includeArrayIndex: familyMembers_idx
       path: $familyMembers

This pipeline uses :pipeline:`$unwind` to create a new record for each
member of ``familyMembers``. The schema will track the array index in
the field ``familyMembers_idx``.

.. _bi-geospatial:

Geospatial Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.1.0

If a collection contains a
:manual:`geospatial index </applications/geospatial-indexes>`, the
connector will map the indexed field into an array of numeric
longitude-latitude coordinates.

For example, given the following collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.points.createIndex( { pos : "2dsphere" } )
   db.points.insert({
       pos : { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.97, 40.77 ] },
       name: "Central Park",
       category : "Parks"
   })

:program:`mongodrdl` will generate the following schema:

.. code-block:: yaml

   schema:
   - db: test
     tables:
     - table: points
       collection: points
       pipeline: []
       columns:
       - Name: _id
         MongoType: bson.ObjectId
         SqlName: _id
         SqlType: varchar
       - Name: category
         MongoType: string
         SqlName: category
         SqlType: varchar
       - Name: name
         MongoType: string
         SqlName: name
         SqlType: varchar
       - Name: pos.coordinates
         MongoType: geo.2darray
         SqlName: pos.coordinates
         SqlType: numeric[]

.. include:: /includes/fact-geospatial-views.rst
