To return information on query plans and execution statistics of the
query plans, MongoDB provides:

- the :method:`db.collection.explain()` method,

- the :method:`cursor.explain()` method, and

- the :dbcommand:`explain` command.

The ``explain`` results present the query plans as a tree of stages.

.. code-block:: javascript

   "winningPlan" : {
      "stage" : <STAGE1>,
      ...
      "inputStage" : {
         "stage" : <STAGE2>,
         ...
         "inputStage" : {
            "stage" : <STAGE3>,
            ...
         }
      }
   },

Each stage passes its results (i.e. documents or index keys) to the
parent node. The leaf nodes access the collection or the indices. The
internal nodes manipulate the documents or the index keys that result
from the child nodes. The root node is the final stage from which
MongoDB derives the result set.

Stages are descriptive of the operation; e.g.

- ``COLLSCAN`` for a collection scan

- ``IXSCAN`` for scanning index keys

- ``FETCH`` for retrieving documents

- ``SHARD_MERGE`` for merging results from shards

- ``SHARDING_FILTER`` for filtering out orphan documents from shards

Explain Output
--------------

The following sections presents a list of some key fields returned by
the ``explain`` operation.

.. note::

   - The list of fields is not meant to be exhaustive, but is meant to
     highlight some key field changes from earlier versions of explain.

   - The output format is subject to change between releases.

            For sharded collections, ``explain`` includes the core
            query planner and server information for each accessed
            shard in the ``shards`` field:

               }


.. data:: explain.queryPlanner

   Contains information on the selection of the query plan by the
   :doc:`query optimizer </core/query-plans>`.

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.namespace

      A string that specifies the :term:`namespace` with the names of
      the database and the collection accessed by the query. The
      namespace has the format ``<database>.<collection>``.

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.indexFilterSet

      A boolean that specifies whether MongoDB applied an :ref:`index
      filter <index-filters>` for the :term:`query shape`.

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.queryHash

      A hexadecimal string that represents the hash of the
      :term:`query shape` and is dependent only on the query shapes.
      ``queryHash`` can help identify slow queries (including the
      query filter of write operations) with the same query shape.

      .. note::

         As with any hash function, two different query shapes may result
         in the same hash value. However, the occurrence of hash
         collisions between different query shapes is unlikely.

      For more information on ``queryHash`` and ``planCacheKey``,
      see :ref:`query-hash-plan-cache-key`.

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.planCacheKey

      A hash of the key for the plan cache entry associated with the
      query.

      Unlike the :data:`~explain.queryPlanner.queryHash`, the
      :data:`~explain.queryPlanner.planCacheKey` is a function of
      both the query shape and the currently available indexes for
      that shape. That is, if indexes that can support the query
      shape are added/dropped, the ``planCacheKey`` value may change
      whereas the ``queryHash`` value would not change.

      For more information on ``queryHash`` and ``planCacheKey``,
      see :ref:`query-hash-plan-cache-key`.

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.optimizedPipeline

      A boolean that indicates that the entire aggregation pipeline
      operation was optimized away, and instead, fulfilled by a tree
      of query plan execution stages.

      For example, starting in MongodB 4.2, the following
      aggregation operation can be fulfilled by the tree of query
      plan execution rather than using the aggregation pipeline.
      
      .. code-block:: javascript

         db.example.aggregate([ { $match: { someFlag: true } } ] )

      The field is only present if the value is ``true`` and only
      applies to explain on aggregation pipeline operations. When
      ``true``, because the pipeline was optimized away, no
      aggregation stage information appears in the output.

      .. versionadded:: 4.2

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan

      A document that details the plan selected by the :doc:`query
      optimizer </core/query-plans>`. MongoDB presents the plan as a
      tree of stages; i.e. a stage can have an
      :data:`~explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStage` or, if the
      stage has multiple child stages,
      :data:`~explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStages`.

      .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.stage

         A string that denotes the name of the stage.

         Each stage consists of information specific to the stage. For
         instance, an ``IXSCAN`` stage will include the index bounds
         along with other data specific to the index scan. If a stage
         has a child stage or multiple child stages, the stage will have an
         inputStage or inputStages.

      .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStage

         A document that describes the child stage, which provides the
         documents or index keys to its parent. The field is present
         *if* the parent stage has only one child.

      .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStages

         An array of documents describing the child stages. Child
         stages provide the documents or index keys to the parent
         stage. The field is present *if* the parent stage has multiple
         child nodes. For example, stages for :ref:`$or expressions
         <explain-output-or-expression>` or :ref:`index intersection
         <explain-output-index-intersection>` consume input from
         multiple sources.

   .. data:: explain.queryPlanner.rejectedPlans

      Array of candidate plans considered and rejected by the
      query optimizer. The array can be empty if there were no other
      candidate plans.

.. _executionStats:

``executionStats``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The returned :data:`~explain.executionStats` information details the
execution of the winning plan. In order to include
``executionStats`` in the results, you must run the explain in either:

- :ref:`executionStats <explain-method-executionStats>` or

- :ref:`allPlansExecution <explain-method-allPlansExecution>`
  verbosity mode. Use ``allPlansExecution`` mode to include partial
  execution data captured during :ref:`plan selection
  <query-plans-query-optimization>`.

                     ...
                  ]
               }

.. data:: explain.executionStats

   Contains statistics that describe the completed query execution for
   the winning plan. For write operations, completed query execution
   refers to the modifications that *would* be performed, but does
   *not* apply the modifications to the database.

   .. data:: explain.executionStats.nReturned

      Number of documents returned by the winning query plan.
      :data:`~explain.executionStats.nReturned` corresponds to the ``n`` field
      returned by ``cursor.explain()`` in earlier versions of MongoDB.

   .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionTimeMillis

      Total time in milliseconds required for query plan selection and
      query execution. It includes the time it takes to run the trial phase 
      part of the plan selection process, but does not include the network time 
      to transmit the data back to the client.

      The time reported by ``explain.executionStats.executionTimeMillis`` is 
      not necessarily representative of actual query time. During steady 
      state operations (when the query plan is cached), or when using 
      :method:`cursor.hint()` with ``cursor.explain()``, MongoDB bypasses the 
      plan selection process, resulting in a faster actual time, leading to 
      a lower ``explain.executionStats.executionTimeMillis`` value.


   .. data:: explain.executionStats.totalKeysExamined

      Number of index entries scanned.
      :data:`~explain.executionStats.totalKeysExamined` corresponds to the
      ``nscanned`` field returned by ``cursor.explain()`` in
      earlier versions of MongoDB.

   .. data:: explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined

      Number of documents examined during query execution. Common
      query execution stages that examine documents are ``COLLSCAN``
      and ``FETCH``.

      .. note::

         :data:`~explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined` refers to
         the total number of documents examined and *not* to the
         number of documents returned. For example, a stage can
         examine a document in order to apply a filter. If the
         document is filtered out, then it has been examined but
         will not be returned as part of the query result set.

         If a document is examined multiple times during query
         execution,
         :data:`~explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined` counts
         each examination. That is,
         :data:`~explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined` is *not* a
         count of the total number of *unique* documents examined.

   .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages

      Details the completed execution of the winning plan as a tree of
      stages; i.e. a stage can have an ``inputStage`` or multiple
      ``inputStages``.

      Each stage consists of execution information specific to the
      stage.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.executionTimeMillisEstimate

         The estimated amount of time in milliseconds for query execution.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.works

         Specifies the number of "work units" performed by the query
         execution stage. Query execution divides its work into small
         units. A "work unit" might consist of examining a single index key,
         fetching a single document from the collection, applying a
         projection to a single document, or doing a piece of internal
         bookkeeping.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.advanced

         The number of intermediate results returned, or *advanced*, by
         this stage to its parent stage.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.needTime

         The number of work cycles that did not advance an intermediate
         result to its parent stage (see
         :data:`explain.executionStats.executionStages.advanced`). For
         instance, an index scan stage may spend a work cycle seeking to a
         new position in the index as opposed to returning an index
         key; this work cycle would count towards
         :data:`explain.executionStats.executionStages.needTime` rather
         than :data:`explain.executionStats.executionStages.advanced`.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.needYield

         The number of times that the storage layer requested that the
         query stage suspend processing and yield its locks.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.saveState

         The number of times that the query stage suspended processing
         and saved its current execution state, for example in
         preparation for yielding its locks.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.restoreState

         The number of times that the query stage restored a saved
         execution state, for example after recovering locks that it had
         previously yielded.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.isEOF

         Specifies whether the execution stage has reached end of stream:

         - If ``true`` or ``1``, the execution stage has reached
           end-of-stream.

         - If ``false`` or ``0``, the stage may still have results to
           return. For example, consider a query with a limit whose
           execution stages consists of a ``LIMIT`` stage with an
           input stage of ``IXSCAN`` for the query. If the query
           returns more than the specified limit, the ``LIMIT`` stage
           will report ``isEOF: 1``, but its underlying ``IXSCAN`` stage
           will report ``isEOF: 0``.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.inputStage.keysExamined

         For query execution stages that scan an index (e.g. IXSCAN),
         ``keysExamined`` is the total number of in-bounds and out-of-bounds
         keys that are examined in the process of the index scan. If the
         index scan consists of a single contiguous range of keys, only
         in-bounds keys need to be examined. If the index bounds consists of
         several key ranges, the index scan execution process may examine
         out-of-bounds keys in order to skip from the end of one range to the
         beginning of the next.

         Consider the following example, where there is an index of field
         ``x`` and the collection contains 100 documents with ``x`` values
         1 through 100:

         .. code-block:: javascript

            db.keys.find( { x : { $in : [ 3, 4, 50, 74, 75, 90 ] } } ).explain( "executionStats" )

         The query will scan keys ``3`` and ``4``. It will then scan the key
         ``5``, detect that it is out-of-bounds, and skip to the next key
         ``50``.

         Continuing this process, the query scans keys
         3, 4, 5, 50, 51, 74, 75, 76, 90, and 91. Keys
         ``5``, ``51``, ``76``, and ``91`` are out-of-bounds keys that are
         still examined. The value of ``keysExamined`` is 10.

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.inputStage.docsExamined

         Specifies the number of documents scanned during the
         query execution stage.

         Present for the ``COLLSCAN`` stage, as well as for stages that
         retrieve documents from the collection (e.g. ``FETCH``)

      .. data:: explain.executionStats.executionStages.inputStage.seeks

         .. versionadded:: 3.4

            For index scan (``IXSCAN``) stages only.

         The number of times that we had to seek the index cursor to
         a new position in order to complete the index scan.

   .. data:: explain.executionStats.allPlansExecution

      Contains *partial* execution information captured during the
      :ref:`plan selection phase <query-plans-query-optimization>` for
      both the winning and rejected plans. The field is present only if
      ``explain`` runs in ``allPlansExecution`` verbosity mode.

.. _serverInfo:

``serverInfo``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   tabs:

      - id: unsharded
        name: "Unsharded Collections"
        content: |

            For unsharded collections, ``explain`` returns the following
            ``serverInfo`` information for the MongoDB instance:

            .. code-block:: none

               "serverInfo" : {
                  "host" : <string>,
                  "port" : <int>,
                  "version" : <string>,
                  "gitVersion" : <string>
               }

      - id: sharded
        name: "Sharded Collections"
        content: |

           For sharded collections, ``explain`` returns the
           ``serverInfo`` for each accessed shard, and a top-level
           ``serverInfo`` object for the :binary:`~bin.mongos`.

           .. code-block:: none

              "queryPlanner" : {
                 ...
                 "winningPlan" : {
                    "stage" : <STAGE1>,
                    "shards" : [
                       {
                          "shardName" : <string>,
                          "connectionString" : <string>,
                          "serverInfo" : {
                             "host" : <string>,
                             "port" : <int>,
                             "version" : <string>,
                             "gitVersion" : <string>
                          },
                          ...
                       }
                       ...
                    ]
                 }
               },
               "serverInfo" : {      // serverInfo for mongos
                 "host" : <string>,
                 "port" : <int>,
                 "version" : <string>,
                 "gitVersion" : <string>
               }
               ...

3.0 Format Change
-----------------

Starting in MongoDB 3.0, the format and fields of the ``explain``
results have changed from previous versions. The following lists some
key differences.

.. _explain-output-collection-scan:

Collection Scan vs. Index Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the query planner selects a collection scan, the explain result
includes a ``COLLSCAN`` stage.

If the query planner selects an index, the explain result includes a
``IXSCAN`` stage. The stage includes information such as the index
key pattern, direction of traversal, and index bounds.

In previous versions of MongoDB, ``cursor.explain()`` returned the
``cursor`` field with the value of:

- ``BasicCursor`` for collection scans, and

- ``BtreeCursor <index name> [<direction>]`` for index scans.

For more information on execution statistics of collection scans versus
index scans, see :doc:`/tutorial/analyze-query-plan`.

.. _explain-output-covered-queries:

Covered Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an index covers a query, MongoDB can both match the query
conditions **and** return the results using only the index keys; i.e.
MongoDB does not need to examine documents from the collection to
return the results.

When an index covers a query, the explain result has an ``IXSCAN``
stage that is **not** a descendant of a ``FETCH`` stage, and in the
:ref:`executionStats`, the :data:`~explain.executionStats.totalDocsExamined` 
is ``0``.

In earlier versions of MongoDB, ``cursor.explain()`` returned the
``indexOnly`` field to indicate whether the index covered a query.

.. _explain-output-index-intersection:

Index Intersection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For an :doc:`index intersection plan </core/index-intersection>`, the
result will include either an ``AND_SORTED`` stage or an ``AND_HASH``
stage with an :data:`~explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStages` array that
details the indexes; e.g.:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "stage" : "AND_SORTED",
      "inputStages" : [
         {
            "stage" : "IXSCAN",
            ...
         },
         {
            "stage" : "IXSCAN",
            ...
         }
      ]
   }

In previous versions of MongoDB, ``cursor.explain()`` returned the
``cursor`` field with the value of ``Complex Plan`` for index
intersections.

.. _explain-output-or-expression:

``$or`` Expression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If MongoDB uses indexes for an :query:`$or` expression, the result will
include the ``OR`` stage with an
:data:`~explain.queryPlanner.winningPlan.inputStages` array that
details the indexes; e.g.:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "stage" : "OR",
      "inputStages" : [
         {
            "stage" : "IXSCAN",
            ...
         },
         {
            "stage" : "IXSCAN",
            ...
         },
         ...
      ]
   }

In previous versions of MongoDB, ``cursor.explain()`` returned the
``clauses`` array that detailed the indexes.

.. _explain-output-sort:

Sort Stage
~~~~~~~~~~

If MongoDB cannot use an index or indexes to obtain the sort order, the
results include a ``SORT`` stage indicating a blocking sort operation.
Blocking sorts do not block concurrent operations on the
collection or database. The name refers to the requirement that the
``SORT`` stage reads all input documents before returning any output
documents, blocking the flow of data for that specific query.

If MongoDB requires using more than 100 megabytes of system memory for
the blocking sort operation, MongoDB returns an error *unless* the query
specifies :method:`cursor.allowDiskUse()` (*New in MongoDB 4.4*).
:method:`~cursor.allowDiskUse()` allows MongoDB to use temporary files
on disk to store data exceeding the 100 megabyte system memory limit
while processing a blocking sort operation. If the explain plan does not
contain an explicit ``SORT`` stage, then MongoDB can use an index to
obtain the sort order.

Prior to MongoDB 3.0, ``cursor.explain()`` returned the
``scanAndOrder`` field to specify whether MongoDB could use the index
order to return sorted results.
