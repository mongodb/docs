====================
Restart a Deployment
====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

If your deployment has been shut down for maintenance or any other reason, you
can restart it directly from MMS. This procedure restarts all the
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` instances in a deployment.

Use this procedure to restart any type of deployment, whether a
:term:`sharded cluster`, :term:`replica set`, or :term:`standalone
deployment <standalone>`.

Considerations
--------------

If the Monitoring Agent cannot collect information from a MongoDB
instance, MMS deactivates the instance in the Monitoring Agent and in
the console. MMS deactivates a :program:`mongos` that is unreachable
for 24 hours and a :program:`mongod` that is unreachable for 7 days.

Procedure
---------

To restart a deployment:
