For the following |onprem| release series, you may run its
:term:`backing databases` on any of the following MongoDB versions:

.. include:: /includes/list-tables/supported-backingdb-versions.rst

Version support covers the full release series from the first to the
last release.

.. example::

   |onprem| 5.0 supports the entire MongoDB release series from
   4.0.0 to 4.0.20.

To learn more about MongoDB versioning, see
:ref:`release-version-numbers` in the MongoDB Manual.

.. important::

   Only the MongoDB |onprem| :term:`backing databases` must meet this
   requirement. The MongoDB deployments that |onprem| manages do not.
   For the minimum versions required for managed MongoDB deployments,
   see :doc:`/reference/mongodb-compatibility/`.
