Overview
--------

Some |service| features such as :ref:`Data Federation 
<atlas-data-federation>` require access to resources in your |azure|
Blob Storage environment. To grant access in a secure manner, create or 
update an |azure| `Service Principal 
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/create-azure-service-principal-azureps>`__
with access policy.  

.. _set-up-azure-access-prereqs:

Prerequisites
-------------

- An |service| :doc:`account </index>`.

- The `Azure PowerShell
  <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/>`__ or the `Azure
  CLI <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/>`__.

Set Up Azure Service Principal Access 
-------------------------------------

You can set up an |azure| service principal with access policy for your 
|service| project from the {+atlas-admin-api+} or {+atlas-ui+} if you
have the :authrole:`Project Owner` role.

.. tabs:: 

   .. tab:: Atlas UI 
      :tabid: ui

      You can use the |azure| PowerShell or :abbr:`CLI (command-line
      interface)` to set up the Service Principal. 

      .. procedure:: 
         :style: normal 

         .. step:: Navigate to the :guilabel:`Integrations` page for your project to configure |azure| Service Principal access.

            a. If it is not already displayed, select the organization
               that contains your desired project from the |ui-org-menu|
               in the navigation bar.
      
            #. Select your desired project from the list of projects in
               the :guilabel:`Projects` page.

            #. Click the vertical ellipsis (:icon-fa4:`ellipsis-v`) next
               to your project name in the upper left corner and select 
               :guilabel:`Integrations` from the dropdown.

            #. Click :guilabel:`Configure` for |azure|.

               |service| displays the :guilabel:`Authorize Azure Service
               Principal` page the first time. Subsequently, |service|
               displays the :guilabel:`Azure Service Principal Access`
               page. 

         .. step:: Start the configuration for |service| to access your |azure| account.

            a. Click :guilabel:`Authorize Azure Service Principal`.
            #. Review the information in the :guilabel:`Overview` and
               click :guilabel:`Next`. 

         .. step:: Assign |service| a relationship to your |azure| account.

            The :guilabel:`Add Atlas to your Azure Service Principal`
            section displays the *AppId* that you can use with your
            command to create your new or add to existing Service
            Principal for |service|. You can use either |azure|
            PowerShell or CLI to create or update the Service Principal.
            To create a new Service Principal, you can follow the step
            in the :guilabel:`Authorize Azure Service Principal` window.

            .. tabs:: 

               .. tab:: PowerShell 
                  :tabid: powershell 

                  a. In a terminal, log into PowerShell and get the
                     tenant ID using the commands displayed in the UI.

                  #. Enter the ID of your |azure| Active Directory
                     tenant in the UI text field.
                  
                  #. Copy and run the PowerShell command displayed in
                     the UI in your PowerShell to create a new Service
                     Principal for |service|. 

                     |service| automatically uses the *AppId* displayed
                     in the :guilabel:`Add Atlas to your Azure Service
                     Principal` section as the value for the
                     ``-AppId`` option. 

                  #. Enter the ID of the service principal that you 
                     created. 
                     
                     The service principal ID is the value of the
                     ``ObjectId`` field in your PowerShell command
                     output.    

               .. tab:: Azure CLI 
                  :tabid: azurecli 

                  a. Get the ID of your |azure| Active Directory tenant
                     using the displayed command and enter the tenant ID
                     returned by the command in the text field in the UI. 
                  
                  #. Copy and run the displayed command in the |azure| 
                     CLI to create a new Service Principal for
                     |service|. 

                     |service| automatically uses the *AppId* displayed
                     in the :guilabel:`Add Atlas to your Azure Service
                     Principal` section as the value for ``--id``
                     option. 

                  #. Enter the ID of the service principal that you
                     created. 
                     
                     The service principal ID is the value of
                     the ``id`` field in the command output.

         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Validate and Finish` to allow |service| to establish the relationship.

   .. tab:: API 
      :tabid: api

      To create an |azure| service principal with access policy for your
      |service| project through the |api|, send ``POST`` requests to
      the :oas-atlas-tag:`cloudProviderAccess </Cloud-Provider-Access>` 
      endpoint first with the ID of the project for which you wish to
      create a service principal and then with the ID of the project and
      service principal for which you set up access. To learn more about
      the request path and body parameters, see :oas-atlas-op:`Create
      One Cloud Provider Access Role </createCloudProviderAccessRole>`
