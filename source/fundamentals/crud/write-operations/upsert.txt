======================================
Insert or Update in a Single Operation
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

If your application stores and modifies data in MongoDB, you probably use
insert and update operations. In certain workflows, you may need to choose
between an insert and update depending on whether the document exists.
In these cases, you can streamline your application logic by using the
``upsert`` option available in the following methods:

- :doc:`updateOne() </usage-examples/updateOne>`
- :doc:`replaceOne() </usage-examples/replaceOne>`
- :doc:`updateMany() </usage-examples/updateMany>`

If the query filter passed to these methods does not find any matches and
you set the ``upsert`` option to ``true``, MongoDB inserts the update
document. Let's go through an example.

Suppose your application tracks the current location of food trucks,
storing the nearest address data in a MongoDB collection that resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   [
     { name: "Haute Skillet", address: "42 Avenue B" },
     { name: "Lady of the Latke", address: "35 Fulton Rd" },
     ...
   ]


As an application user, you read about a food truck changing its regular
location and want to apply the update. This update might resemble the
following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const query = { name: "Deli Llama" };
   const update = { name: "Deli Llama", address: "3 Nassau St" };
   const options = {};
   collection.updateOne(query, update, options);

If a food truck named "Deli Llama" exists, the method call above updates
the document in the collection. However, if there are no food trucks named
"Deli Llama" in your collection, no changes are made.

Consider the case in which you want to add information about the food
truck even if it does not currently exist in your collection. Rather than
first querying whether it exists to determine whether we need to insert or
update the document, we can set ``upsert`` to ``true`` in our call to
``updateOne()`` as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const query = { name: "Deli Llama" };
   const update = { name: "Deli Llama", address: "3 Nassau St" };
   const options = { upsert: true };
   collection.updateOne(query, update, options);

After you run the operation above, your collection should resemble the
following, whether the "Deli Llama" document existed in your collection
beforehand:

.. code-block:: javascript

   [
     { name: "Haute Skillet", address: "42 Avenue B" },
     { name: "Lady of the Latke", address: "35 Fulton Rd" },
     { name: "Deli Llama", address: "3 Nassau St" },
     ...
   ]
