Create Indexes to Support Your Queries
======================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

An index supports a query when the index contains all the fields scanned
by the query. The query scans the index and not the collection. Creating indexes
that support queries results in greatly increased query performance.

This document describes strategies for creating indexes that support queries.

Create a Single-Key Index if All Queries Use the Same, Single Key
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you only ever query on a single key in a given collection, then you need
to create just one single-key index for that collection. For example, you
might create an index on ``category`` in the ``product`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.ensureIndex( { "category": 1 } )

.. _compound-key-indexes:

Create Compound Indexes to Support Several Different Queries
------------------------------------------------------------

If you sometimes query on only one key and at other times query on that
key combined with a second key, then creating a compound index is more
efficient than creating a single-key index. MongoDB will use the
compound index for both queries. For example, you might create an index
on both ``category`` and ``item``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.products.ensureIndex( { "category": 1, "item": 1 } )

This allows you both options. You can query on just ``category``, and
you also can query on ``category`` combined with ``item``.
A single :ref:`compound index <index-type-compound>` on multiple fields
can support all the queries that search a "prefix" subset of those fields.

.. example::

   The following index on a collection:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }

   Can support queries that the following indexes support:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { x: 1 }
      { x: 1, y: 1 }

   There are some situations where the prefix indexes may offer better
   query performance: for example if ``z`` is a large array.

   The ``{ x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }`` index can also support many of the same
   queries as the following index:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { x: 1, z: 1 }

   Also, ``{ x: 1, z: 1 }`` has an additional use. Given the following
   query:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.collection.find( { x: 5 } ).sort( { z: 1} )

   The ``{ x: 1, z: 1 }`` index supports both the query and the sort
   operation, while the ``{ x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }`` index only supports
   the query. For more information on sorting, see
   :ref:`sorting-with-indexes`.

Create Indexes that Support Covered Queries
-------------------------------------------

A covered query is a query in which:

- all the fields in the :ref:`query <read-operations-query-document>`
  are part of an index, **and**

- all the fields returned in the results are in the same index.

Because the index "covers" the query, MongoDB can both match the
:ref:`query conditions <read-operations-query-document>` **and** return
the results using only the index; MongoDB does not need to look at the
documents, only the index, to fulfill the query.

Querying *only* the index can be much faster than querying documents
outside of the index. Index keys are typically smaller than the
documents they catalog, and indexes are typically available in RAM or
located sequentially on disk.

MongoDB automatically uses an index that covers a query when possible.
To ensure that an index can *cover* a query, create an index that
includes all the fields listed in the :ref:`query document
<read-operations-query-document>` and in the query result. You can
specify the fields to return in the query results with a
:ref:`projection <projection>` document. By default, MongoDB includes
the ``_id`` field in the query result. So, if the index does **not**
include the ``_id`` field, then you must exclude the ``_id`` field
(i.e. ``_id: 0``) from the query results.

.. example::

   Given collection ``users`` with an index on the fields ``user`` and
   ``status``, as created by the following option:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.users.ensureIndex( { status: 1, user: 1 } )

   Then, this index will cover the following query which selects on
   the ``status`` field and returns only the ``user`` field:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.users.find( { status: "A" }, { user: 1, _id: 0 } )

   In the operation, the projection document explicitly specifies
   ``_id: 0`` to exclude the ``_id`` field from the result since the
   index is only on the ``status`` and the ``user`` fields.

   If the projection document does not specify the exclusion of the
   ``_id`` field, the query returns the ``_id`` field. The following
   query is **not** covered by the index on the ``status`` and the
   ``user`` fields because with the projection document ``{ user: 1
   }``, the query returns both the ``user`` field and the ``_id`` field:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.users.find( { status: "A" }, { user: 1 } )

An index **cannot** cover a query if:

- any of the indexed fields in any of the documents in the collection
  includes an array. If an indexed field is an array, the index becomes
  a :ref:`multi-key index <index-type-multikey>` index and cannot
  support a covered query.

- any of the indexed fields are fields in subdocuments. To index fields
  in subdocuments, use :term:`dot notation`. For example, consider
  a collection ``users`` with documents of the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     { _id: 1, user: { login: "tester" } }

  The collection has the following indexes:

  .. code-block:: none

     { user: 1 }

     { "user.login": 1 }

  The ``{ user: 1 }`` index covers the following query:

  .. code-block:: none

     db.users.find( { user: { login: "tester" } }, { user: 1, _id: 0 } )

  However, the ``{ "user.login": 1 }`` index does **not** cover the
  following query:

  .. code-block:: none

     db.users.find( { "user.login": "tester" }, { "user.login": 1, _id: 0 } )

  The query, however, does use the ``{ "user.login": 1 }`` index to
  find matching documents.

To determine whether a query is a covered query, use the
:method:`~cursor.explain()` method. If the :method:`~cursor.explain()`
output displays ``true`` for the :data:`~explain.indexOnly` field, the
query is covered by an index, and MongoDB queries only that index to
match the query **and** return the results.
