title: "Wait for the |k8s-op-short| Pods to reach a ``READY`` state."
level: 4
ref: wait-for-ready-resources
content: |

  Use the following command to get the status of the Pods in your
  cluster:
  
  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -w

  Inspect the response. In the ``READY`` column for your |k8s-op-short|
  Pod, ensure that the value in this column shows that all Pods are 
  ready. In the following sample output, the single |k8s-op-short| Pod 
  is ready.

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false
     :emphasize-lines: 2

     NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
     mongodb-enterprise-operator-d7d5d9b7c-p4xl4   1/1     Running   0     7m39s
     
  When all |k8s-op-short| Pods are ``READY``, proceed to the next step.

  Using the certificates stored in your existing secrets, create one new
  secret for each component that you want to secure using |tls|.

  For more information, see the prerequisites in the |k8s-op-short|
  |tls| tutorials:

  - :ref:`secure-om-db-tls` for {+appdb+} resources
  - :ref:`deploy-om-container` for |onprem| resources
  - :ref:`k8s-secure-resources` for database resources

title: "Update your CRDs to use the new |tls| secret fields."
level: 4
ref: update-crds
content: |

  In each of the resources that you secure with |tls|, update the
  following fields, as appropriate, to reference the new |tls| secrets
  you created in the previous step:

  - {+appdb+} |tls| secrets: :opsmgrkube:`applicationDatabase.security.certsSecretPrefix`
  - |onprem| |tls| secrets: :opsmgrkube:`security.certsSecretPrefix`
  - Database resource |tls| secrets: :setting:`security.security.certsSecretPrefix`

  For each CRD you updated, run the following command to apply your
  changes to the |k8s| cluster:

  .. code-block:: sh

     kubectl replace -f <resource-crd>.yaml

  When all of the resources you updated reach a ``READY`` state, you can
  re-enable internal cluster authentication and X.509 authentication if
  you disabled it to migrate your |tls| secrets.
