# Upgrade a Sharded Cluster to 3.4

Package Updates required on Ubuntu 16.04 for IBM POWER Systems: Due to a lock elision bug present in older versions of the ``glibc``
package on Ubuntu 16.04 for POWER, you must upgrade the ``glibc``
package to at least ``glibc 2.23-0ubuntu5`` before running MongoDB.
Systems with older versions of the ``glibc`` package will experience
database server crashes and misbehavior due to random memory
corruption, and are unsuitable for production deployments of MongoDB

Important: Before you attempt any upgrade, please familiarize yourself with the content of this document.

If you need guidance on upgrading to 3.4, [MongoDB offers major version
upgrade services](https://www.mongodb.com/products/consulting?jmp=docs) to help ensure
a smooth transition without interruption to your MongoDB application.


## Upgrade Recommendations and Checklists

When upgrading, consider the following:


### Upgrade Version Path

To upgrade an existing MongoDB deployment to 3.4, you must be running a
3.2-series release.

To upgrade from a version earlier than the 3.2-series, you must
successively upgrade major releases until you have upgraded to
3.2-series. For example, if you are running a 3.0-series, you must
upgrade first to [3.2](../3.2-upgrade/) *before* you can upgrade to 3.4.


### Preparedness

Before beginning your upgrade, see the [Compatibility Changes in MongoDB 3.4](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4-compatibility) document to
ensure that your applications and deployments are compatible with
MongoDB 3.4. Resolve the incompatibilities in your deployment before
starting the upgrade.

Before upgrading MongoDB, always test your application in a staging
environment before deploying the upgrade to your production
environment.


### Downgrade Consideration

Once upgraded to 3.4, you cannot downgrade to a 3.2.7 or earlier
version. You can only downgrade to a 3.2.8 or later version.

Avoid reconfiguring replica sets that contain members of different
MongoDB versions as validation rules may differ across MongoDB versions.


### ``mongos`` and Earlier Versions of ``mongod`` Instances

Version 3.4 [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos) instances cannot connect to
earlier versions of [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instances.

The 3.2 and earlier [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell is not compatible with 3.4
clusters.


## Prerequisites

* Version 3.2 or Greater

     To upgrade a sharded cluster to 3.4, **all** members of the
     cluster must be at least version 3.2. The upgrade process checks
     all components of the cluster and will produce warnings if any
     component is running version earlier than 3.2.

* Config Server as Replica Set (CSRS)

     Starting in 3.4, the use of the deprecated mirrored
     [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instances as config servers (SCCC) is no longer
     supported. Before you can upgrade your sharded clusters to 3.4, you
     must convert your config servers from SCCC to a replica set (CSRS).

     To convert your config servers from SCCC to CSRS, see
     [Upgrade Config Servers to Replica Set](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/upgrade-config-servers-to-replica-set).

* Stop Metadata Changes during the Upgrade

     During the upgrade, ensure that clients do not make changes to the
     collection metadata. For example, during the upgrade, do **not**
     perform any of the following operations:

     * [``sh.enableSharding()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.enableSharding/#sh.enableSharding)

     * [``sh.shardCollection()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.shardCollection/#sh.shardCollection)

     * [``sh.addShard()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.addShard/#sh.addShard)

     * [``db.createCollection()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.createCollection/#db.createCollection)

     * [``db.collection.drop()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.drop/#db.collection.drop)

     * [``db.dropDatabase()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.dropDatabase/#db.dropDatabase)

     * any operation that creates a database

     * any other operation that modifies the cluster metadata in any way.

     See the [Sharding Reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sharding) for a complete list of sharding
     commands. Not all commands on the [Sharding Reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sharding) page
     modify the cluster metadata.

* [Disable the balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily)

* Back up the ``config`` Database

     *Optional but Recommended.* As a precaution, take a backup of the
     ``config`` database *before* upgrading the sharded cluster.


## Download 3.4 Binaries


### Use Package Manager

If you installed MongoDB from the MongoDB ``apt``, ``yum``, ``dnf``, or
``zypper`` repositories, you should upgrade to 3.4 using your package
manager.

Follow the appropriate [installation instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux) for your Linux system. This will
involve adding a repository for the new release, then performing the
actual upgrade process.


### Download 3.4 Binaries Manually

If you have not installed MongoDB using a package manager, you can
manually download the MongoDB binaries from the [MongoDB Download
Center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=docs).

See [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation) for more information.


## Upgrade Process


### Step 1: Disable the Balancer.

Disable the balancer as described in
[Disable the Balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily).


### Step 2: Upgrade the config servers.

If the config servers are replica sets:

1. Upgrade the [secondary](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-members/#replica-set-secondary-members) members of the replica set one at a time:

   1. Shut down the secondary [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance and replace the 3.2 binary with the 3.4 binary.

   2. Start the 3.4 binary with both the ``--configsvr`` and ``--port`` options:

      ```sh

      mongod --configsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path>

      ```

      If using a [configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options), update the file to
      specify [``sharding.clusterRole: configsvr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.clusterRole) and [``net.port``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.port) and start the
      3.4 binary:

      ```yaml

      sharding:
         clusterRole: configsvr
      net:
         port: <port>
      storage:
         dbpath: <path>

      ```

      Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.

   3. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before upgrading the next secondary member. To check the member's state, issue [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) in the [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell.

      Repeat for each secondary member.

2. Step down the replica set primary.

   1. Connect a [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell to the primary and use [``rs.stepDown()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.stepDown/#rs.stepDown) to step down the primary and force an election of a new primary:

      ```javascript

      rs.stepDown()

      ```

   2. When [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) shows that the primary has stepped down and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, shut down the stepped-down primary and replace the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary with the 3.4 binary.

   3. Start the 3.4 binary with both the ``--configsvr`` and ``--port`` options:

      ```sh

      mongod --configsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path>

      ```

      If using a [configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options), update the file to
      specify [``sharding.clusterRole: configsvr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.clusterRole) and [``net.port``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.port) and start the
      3.4 binary:

      ```yaml

      sharding:
         clusterRole: configsvr
      net:
         port: <port>
      storage:
         dbpath: <path>

      ```

      Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.


### Step 3: Upgrade the shards.

Upgrade the shards one at a time. If the shards are replica sets, for each shard:

1. Upgrade the [secondary](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-members/#replica-set-secondary-members) members of the replica set one at a time:

   1. Shut down the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance and replace the 3.2 binary with the 3.4 binary.

   2. Start the 3.4 binary with the ``--shardsvr`` and ``--port`` command line options.

      ```sh

      mongod --shardsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path>

      ```

      Of if using a [configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options), update the file to
      include [``sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.clusterRole) and [``net.port``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.port) and start:

      ```yaml

      sharding:
         clusterRole: shardsvr
      net:
         port: <port>
      storage:
         dbpath: <path>

      ```

      Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.

   3. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before upgrading the next secondary member. To check the member's state, you can issue [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) in the [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell.

      Repeat for each secondary member.

2. Step down the replica set primary.

   Connect a [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell to the primary and use
   [``rs.stepDown()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.stepDown/#rs.stepDown) to step down the primary and force an
   election of a new primary:

   ```javascript

   rs.stepDown()

   ```

3. When [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) shows that the primary has stepped down and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, upgrade the stepped-down primary:

   1. Shut down the stepped-down primary and replace the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary with the 3.4 binary.

   2. Start the 3.4 binary with the ``--shardsvr`` and ``--port`` command line options.

      ```sh

      mongod --shardsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path>

      ```

      Of if using a [configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options), update the file to
      specify [``sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.clusterRole) and [``net.port``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#net.port) and start the
      3.4 binary:

      ```yaml

      sharding:
         clusterRole: shardsvr
      net:
         port: <port>
      storage:
         dbpath: <path>

      ```

      Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.


### Step 4: Upgrade the ``mongos`` instances.

Replace each [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos) instance with the 3.4 binary and
restart. Include any other configuration as appropriate for your deployment.

Note: In 3.4, [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos) no longer supports  ``--chunkSize`` and ``--noAutoSplit`` runtime options (or the corresponding ``sharding.chunkSize`` and ``sharding.autoSplit`` settings).  If your 3.2 [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos) configuration includes these settings, remove the settings when running the 3.4 [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos).

```sh

mongos --configdb csReplSet/<rsconfigsver1:port1>,<rsconfigsver2:port2>,<rsconfigsver3:port3>

```


### Step 5: Re-enable the balancer.

Using a 3.4 [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell, re-enable the balancer as
described in [Enable the Balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharding-balancing-enable).

The 3.2 and earlier [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell is not compatible with 3.4
clusters.


### Step 6: Enable backwards-incompatible 3.4 features.

At this point, you can run the 3.4 binaries without the
3.4 [features that are incompatible](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4-compatibility/#compatibility-enabled) with 3.2.

To enable these 3.4 features, set the feature compatibility
version to 3.4.

Warning: Enabling these backwards-incompatible features can [complicate the downgrade process](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4-downgrade/#downgrade-features-prereq). For details, see [Remove 3.4 Incompatible Features](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.4-downgrade/#downgrade-features-prereq).It is recommended that after upgrading, you allow your deployment to run without enabling these features for a burn-in period to ensure the likelihood of downgrade is minimal. When you are confident that the likelihood of downgrade is minimal, enable these features.

On a [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos) instance, run the
``setFeatureCompatibilityVersion`` command in the ``admin``
database:

```javascript

db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.4" } )

```

This command must perform writes to an internal system
collection. If for any reason the command does not complete
successfully, you can safely retry the command on the
[``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos) as the operation is idempotent.
