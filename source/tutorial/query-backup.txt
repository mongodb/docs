=======================
Query a Backup Snapshot
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

|mms| provides queryable backups. This functionality allows you to
query specific backup snapshot. You can use the queryable backups to:

- Restore a subset of data within the MongoDB deployment.

- Compare previous versions of data against the current data.

- Identify the best point in time to restore a system by comparing data
  from multiple snapshots.

Considerations
--------------

Read-Only Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/extracts/queryable-backup-duration.rst

Query Restrictions on the Queryable Snapshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You cannot run map-reduce operations.

- You cannot run queries that requires disk usage, such as running
  aggregation with the ``allowDiskUse`` option to perfrom large sort
  operations.

Connection Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connections to these instances are over TLS/SSL and require a X.509
authentication. |mms| provides:

- An executable that creates a :ref:`tunnel <query-via-tunnel>` which
  handles the connection, including the client TLS/SSL and the X.509
  authentication.

  .. only:: onprem

     Requests are routed through the tunnel. The tunnel ensures the
     request is speaking to the correct :program:`mongod` instance.

- X.509 certificates if you want to handle the connection details
  manually, including the TLS/SSL and the X.509 authentication.

  .. only:: onprem

     Requests come in through the web server, which acts as a proxy to
     the :program:`mongod`.

.. _query-via-tunnel:

Query Backup (Use Tunnel to Connect)
------------------------------------

.. note::

   The tunnel handles the security (TLS/SSL and X.509 authentication)
   for connecting to the instance.

.. include:: /includes/steps/query-backup-tunnel.rst

.. tip::

   Once you have finished querying this snapshot, you can terminate the
   queryable instance:

   #. Go to the :guilabel:`Restore History` and hover over the
      :guilabel:`Status` column for the deployment item.

   #. Click :guilabel:`Cancel`.

.. _query-via-manual-connection:

Query Backup (Handle TLS and Authentication Manually)
-----------------------------------------------------

.. note:: 

   The X.509 certificates are valid for 24 hours. 

.. include:: /includes/steps/query-backup-manual.rst

.. tip::

   Once you have finished querying this snapshot, you can terminate the
   queryable instance:

   #. Go to the :guilabel:`Restore History` and hover over the
      :guilabel:`Status` column for the deployment item.

   #. Click :guilabel:`Cancel`.
