The project overview is a landing page for your |service| project that
displays modules that contain common |service| actions. The
overview makes it easy to find resources and manage your
{+database-deployments+} from the |service| home page.

To navigate to the project overview, click :guilabel:`Overview` in the
sidebar in |service|. If |service| doesn't display an
:guilabel:`Overview` option, you must first 
:ref:`enable the overview <enable-project-overview>` for your
project. If you don't enable the project overview, |service| displays
:guilabel:`Database Deployments` as the project landing page.

Required Access
---------------

To enable or disable the project overview, you must have 
:authrole:`Project Owner` or :authrole:`Organization Owner` access to |service|.
