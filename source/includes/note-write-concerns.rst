.. note::
   
   In earlier versions of MongoDB, write operations by default returned
   immediately after issuing the write request. To revert to this
   behavior, set the write concern to ``0``. See the documentation of
   :ref:`write concern <write-concern>` and
   :doc:`/applications/write-operations` for more information.
