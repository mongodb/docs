  .. important::

     Cancelling your subscription unlinks your |aws| billing account
     from MongoDB but does **not** delete your resources or data. You
     will continue to incur charges for your MongoDB resources and data
     after you unlink your AWS billing account. To manage billing
     through MongoDB, see :ref:`atlas-billing`. To delete your 
     |service| resources and data, see :ref:`delete-atlas-account`.

  A modal asking you if you are sure you want to cancel your subscription
  displays. If you wish to cancel your subscription,
  select the checkbox, then click :guilabel:`Yes, cancel subscription`.
  Upon successful cancellation of your subscription,
  a green banner displays at the top of the 
  :guilabel:`Manage Subscriptions` page.

  If you do not wish to cancel, click :guilabel:`No, don't cancel`.
