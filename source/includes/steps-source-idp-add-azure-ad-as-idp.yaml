  a. In the :guilabel:`User Attributes & Claims` section, click the

  - :guilabel:`Source`: ``Attribute``
  - :guilabel:`Source attribute`: ``user.userprincipalname``

    .. important:: Selecting ``Source attribute``

      Depending on your Active Directory configuration, the source attribute 
      that contains a user's full email address may not be ``user.userprincipalname``. 
      Use the source attribute that contains the email address that matches 
      the usernames of existing |service| users within your federated domain,
      such as ``user.mail``.

      For existing |service| users in your federated domain, select the source attribute 
      that contains the current |service| usernames of those users.

  To edit the :guilabel:`Unique User Identifier` required claim, see
  the :azure:`Azure documentation

  Add the following user claims to the |saml| token |idp-provider|
  sends to |service|:

  .. important::

     The values in the **Name** column are case-sensitive. Enter them
     exactly as shown.

     You must leave the ``Namespace`` field empty for all user claims.

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 25 25 50

     * - Name
       - Source
       - Source Attribute

     * - ``lastName``
       - Attribute
       - ``user.surname``

     * - ``email``
       - Attribute
       - ``user.userprincipalname``

  .. note::

     Depending on your Active Directory configuration, the source
     attributes you use may be different. Use the source attributes
     that contain a user's first name, last name, and full email
     address for the appropriate claims.

  To add user claims, see the :azure:`Azure documentation

title: "Add group claims to the SAML token."
level: 4
optional: true
content: |

  Skip this step if you won't use
  :doc:`role mapping </security/manage-role-mapping/>`.

  To use role mapping, add the following group claim to the |saml|
  token Azure AD sends to Atlas:

  a. Click :guilabel:`Add a group claim`.
     Azure displays the :guilabel:`Group Claims` panel.
  b. In :guilabel:`Which groups associated with the user should be
     returned in the claim?`, click :guilabel:`Security groups`.

     What groups you select depend on the type of groups you configured
     in your Azure environment. You may need to select a different
     type of group to send the appropriate group information.

  c. From the :guilabel:`Source attribute` dropdown menu, click
     :guilabel:`Group Id`.

     If you select :guilabel:`Group Id`, Azure sends the security
     group's Object ID and not the human-readable group name. Depending
     on your Azure environment, you may have the option to select a
     different source attribute which sends the group name instead.

     When creating role mappings in Atlas, match the Azure group data
     sent in the |saml| response to the configured |service| role
     mapping name exactly.

  d. Click :guilabel:`Customize the name of the group claim` in the
     :guilabel:`Advanced options` section.

  e. Set :guilabel:`Name` to **memberOf**.
  f. Leave :guilabel:`Namespace` blank.
  g. Clear :guilabel:`Emit groups as role claims`.
  h. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

content: |

  To generate a valid |saml| signing certificate, you must assign 
  temporary values to the :guilabel:`Identifier` and :guilabel:`Reply URL` for your 
  :abbr:`Azure AD (Azure Active Directory)` enterprise application. If 
  you download the certificate before setting these values, the 
  downloaded certificate won't be unique and you must download the 
  certificate again after setting these values. 
  
  To set the temporary values:

  a. Click :guilabel:`Edit` in Section 1.

  #. Remove any existing default values and set the following temporary 
     values:

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 40 60
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Setting
          - Temporary Value
        * - :guilabel:`Identifier (Entity ID)`

        * - :guilabel:`Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)`.
          - ``https://auth.mongodb.com/sso/saml2/``

  #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

  #. Refresh the browser page to ensure that the certificate is 
     regenerated. 
     
     The certificate's thumbprint and expiration date change 
     from the values they held after the temporary Identifier and Reply 
     |url| are updated for the first time.
