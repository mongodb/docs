You can upgrade the major, minor, or feature compatibility versions of
your MongoDB resource. Configure these settings in your :ref:`k8s-specification`.

Overview
-------- 

To upgrade your resource's major or minor versions, set the
:setting:`spec.version` setting to the desired MongoDB version.

To modify your resource's
:manual:`feature compatibility version </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/>`,
set the :setting:`spec.featureCompatibilityVersion` setting to the desired 
version.

.. note::

   If you update ``spec.version`` to a later version, consider setting
   :setting:`spec.featureCompatibilityVersion` to the current working
   MongoDB version to give yourself the option to downgrade if
   necessary. To learn more about feature compatibility, see
   :dbcommand:`setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` in the MongoDB Server
   Documentation.

Procedure
---------

To upgrade the standalone deployment's MongoDB version from ``4.2.2-ent``
to ``4.4.18-ent``, complete the steps in the following syntactic example.

If you update ``spec.version`` to a later version without setting the
:setting:`spec.featureCompatibilityVersion` to any value, the Feature
Compatibility Version (FCV) upgrades to the **same version** that you specify
in ``spec.version``. However, you can explicitly specify a previous
version for the FCV. The following example illustrates this use case.
It sets ``spec.version`` to ``4.4.18-ent`` and
:setting:`spec.featureCompatibilityVersion` to ``4.2``.
