Deploy a Standalone MongoDB Instance
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can deploy a :term:`standalone` MongoDB instance managed by |mms|. Use
standalone instances for testing and development.
**Do not** use these deployments, which lack replication and high
availability, for production systems. For all production deployments
use replica sets. See :doc:`/tutorial/deploy-replica-set` for
production deployments.

Prerequisites
-------------

You must :doc:`provision a server </tutorial/nav/add-servers>` to which to
deploy. For testing purposes, you can use your localhost.
