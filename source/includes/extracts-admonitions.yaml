      - **New Feature**: UI design updates and navigation enhancements:

         - The :guilabel:`Settings` view in the left-hand navigation bar now
           contains only the group-level settings. To access user-specific
           settings, click on your user name in the upper-right hand corner
           and select :guilabel:`Account`.

         - The :guilabel:`Users` view (i.e. |service| users who belong to the
           group, i.e. not the MongoDB users) is now available directly from
           the left-hand navigation bar.

      - **New Feature**: Backup snapshot schedule allows any number of days/weeks/months of retention from the API.
      
      - **New Feature**: Ability to :ref:`rename Group <group-settings-page>` by the Group owner.

      - **New Feature**: :doc:`Data Explorer view <data-explorer>` provides the ability to introspect collections.

      - **New Feature**: :doc:`Queryable Backup </tutorial/query-backup>` is available.
