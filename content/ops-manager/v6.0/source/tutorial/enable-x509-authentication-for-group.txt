MongoDB supports x.509 client and member certificate authentication for
use with a secure :doc:`TLS/SSL connection </tutorial/enable-ssl-for-a-deployment>`.
The x.509 authentication allows users and other members to authenticate
to servers with certificates rather than with a username and password.

Prerequisites

Procedures
----------

These procedures describe how to configure and enable x.509
authentication when using Automation. If |mms| does *not* manage your
agents, you must manually configure them to use x.509 authentication.

.. note::

   To learn more, see
   :doc:`/tutorial/configure-mongodb-agent-for-x509`.

Prepare an Existing Deployment for x.509 Certificate Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::
   
   Using x.509 client certificate authentication requires |tls-ssl|. 
   If |mms| manages one or more existing deployments, |tls-ssl| must 
   be enabled on each process in the MongoDB deployment before 
   enabling x.509 authentication.

.. note::

   If |tls-ssl| is already enabled, you may skip this procedure.

Configure an Existing Deployment for x.509 Member Certificate Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   This procedure is optional. It enables members of a replica set or sharded cluster to also use x.509 certificates to authenticate each other. If it is not configured, replica set and sharded cluster members can still authenticate with each other using ``keyFile`` authentication.

.. important::

   If you :ref:`configured the {+mdbagent+} PEM <configure-tls-mdbagent>` 
   and set :setting:`security.clusterAuthMode`: to ``x509``,
   a warning that 
   ``Client connecting with server's own TLS certificate``
   displays in the ``mongod`` log files,
   indicating that the client is connecting with 
   the server's own TLS certificate.

   This is expected behavior, because the {+mdbagent+} 
   connects to |mms| using the internal authorization 
   configuration. No action is necessary.

.. include:: /includes/steps/configure-members-for-x509.rst

When you have configured the |tls-ssl| options for each deployed 
process, you can proceed to enable x.509 authentication for your |mms| 
project.
