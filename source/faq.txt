What is an Operator?
--------------------

An operator is a standard mechanism that extends the control plane of 
|k8s| to managing custom |k8s| resources. Because each operator is 
built for its own Custom Resources (CRs), it can contain logic that 
addresses the type of service that the operator is built for. For the 
|k8s-op-short|, the operator includes the logic for the deployment of 
MongoDB Server and Ops Manager instances.

Each CR used by the |k8s-op-short| represents an element of a MongoDB 
Server deployment in |k8s|, and has options for customizing that part
of the deployment. Once you configure these objects in the |k8s| 
deployment, the operator builds native |k8s| objects, such as Stateful 
Sets that are necessary to create Pods according to your specified 
requirements for MongoDB Servers. The operator also facilitates 
configuration of MongoDB Server features, such as database backups, 
through interaction with |cloud| or |onprem|.

Why should I run MongoDB Server and MongoDB Enterprise Advanced in |k8s|?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you deploy MongoDB Server or MongoDB Enterprise Advanced in |k8s| 
through the |k8s-op-full|, your deployments can benefit from the 
resilience and simple orchestration that |k8s| provides.

The only supported way to deploy MongoDB Enterprise Advanced in |k8s| is 
through the |k8s-op-full|. The |k8s-op-full| simplifies your daily 
workflows and makes it easier for MongoDB technical support staff to 
assist you when needed.

Which |k8s| platforms are supported for MongoDB Server deployments?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

MongoDB Server supports any platform that builds upon native |k8s| 
without changing the default logic or behavior. In practice, this means
that MongoDB Server supports any |k8s| platform 
`certified by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation <https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/>`_. 
To learn more, see 
:ref:`MongoDB Kubernetes Operator Compatibility <k8s-compatibility>`.

How many deployments can |k8s-op-full| support?
-----------------------------------------------

|k8s-op-short| can support up to 50 deployments. However, changes made
to large numbers of deployments at the same time result in long 
reconciliation times. To avoid prolonged reconciliation times, limit a
given |k8s-op-short| instance to 20 deployments. To learn more, 
see the :ref:`production notes <deploy_recommended-number-sets>`.

Should I run MongoDB Server in |k8s| in the same cluster as the application using it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To help minimize latency, consider colocating your database and 
applications on the same |k8s| cluster if your deployment architecture
allows this.

Can I deploy MongoDB Server across multiple |k8s| clusters?
-----------------------------------------------------------

This feature is available in Beta releases, as described in 
:ref:`Deploy MongoDB Resources on Multiple Kubernetes Clusters <multi-cluster>`.
