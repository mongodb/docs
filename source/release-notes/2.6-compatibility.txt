The following 2.6 changes can affect the compatibility with older
versions of MongoDB. See :doc:`/release-notes/2.6` for the full list of
the 2.6 changes.

Index Changes
-------------

.. _2.6-index-key-length-incompatibility:

Enforce Index Key Length Limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   MongoDB 2.6 implements a stronger enforcement of the limit on
   :limit:`index key <Index Key>`.

   Creating indexes will error if an index key in an existing document
   exceeds the limit:

   - :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()`,
     :method:`db.collection.reIndex()`, :dbcommand:`compact`, and
     ``repairDatabase`` will error and not create the index.
     Previous versions of MongoDB would create the index but not index
     such documents.

   - Because :method:`db.collection.reIndex()`, :dbcommand:`compact`,
     and :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` drop *all* the indexes from a
     collection and then recreate them sequentially, the error from the
     index key limit prevents these operations from rebuilding any
     remaining indexes for the collection and, in the case of the
     :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` command, from continuing with the
     remainder of the process.

   Inserts will error:

   - :method:`db.collection.insert()` and other operations that perform
     inserts (e.g. :method:`db.collection.save()` and
     :method:`db.collection.update()` with ``upsert`` that result in
     inserts) will fail to insert if the new document has an indexed
     field whose corresponding index entry exceeds the limit.
     Previous versions of MongoDB would insert but not index such
     documents.

   - :binary:`~bin.mongorestore` and :binary:`~bin.mongoimport` will fail to
     insert if the new document has an indexed field whose
     corresponding index entry exceeds the limit.

   Updates will error:

   - :method:`db.collection.update()` and
     :method:`db.collection.save()` operations on an indexed field will
     error if the updated value causes the index entry to exceed the
     limit.

   - If an existing document contains an indexed field whose index
     entry exceeds the limit, updates on other fields that result in
     the relocation of a document on disk will error.

   Chunk Migration will fail:

   - Migrations will fail for a chunk that has a document with an
     indexed field whose index entry exceeds the limit.

   - If left unfixed, the chunk will repeatedly fail migration,
     effectively ceasing chunk balancing for that collection. Or, if
     chunk splits occur in response to the migration failures, this
     response would lead to unnecessarily large number of chunks and an
     overly large config databases.

   Secondary members of replica sets will warn:

   - Secondaries will continue to replicate documents with an indexed
     field whose corresponding index entry exceeds the limit on initial
     sync but will print warnings in the logs.

   - Secondaries allow index build and rebuild operations on a
     collection that contains an indexed field whose corresponding
     index entry exceeds the limit but with warnings in the logs.

   - With *mixed version* replica sets where the secondaries are
     version 2.6 and the primary is version 2.4, secondaries will
     replicate documents inserted or updated on the 2.4 primary, but
     will print error messages in the log if the documents contain an
     indexed field whose corresponding index entry exceeds the limit.

Solution
   Run :v2.6:`db.upgradeCheckAllDBs()
   </reference/method/db.upgradeCheckAllDBs>` to find current keys that
   violate this limit and correct as appropriate. Preferably, run the
   test before upgrading; i.e. connect the 2.6 :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
   to your MongoDB 2.4 database and run the method.

If you have an existing data set and want to disable the default index
key length validation so that you can upgrade before resolving these
indexing issues, use the :parameter:`failIndexKeyTooLong` parameter.

Index Specifications Validate Field Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   In MongoDB 2.6, create and re-index operations fail when the index
   key refers to an empty field, e.g. ``"a..b" : 1`` or the field name
   starts with a dollar sign (``$``).

   - :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()` will not create a new index
     with an invalid or empty key name.

   - :method:`db.collection.reIndex()`, :dbcommand:`compact`, and
     :dbcommand:`repairDatabase` will error if an index exists with an
     invalid or empty key name.

   - Chunk migration will fail if an index exists with an
     invalid or empty key name.

   Previous versions of MongoDB allow the index.

Solution
   Run :v2.6:`db.upgradeCheckAllDBs()
   </reference/method/db.upgradeCheckAllDBs>` to find current keys that
   violate this limit and correct as appropriate. Preferably, run the
   test before upgrading; i.e. connect the 2.6 :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
   to your MongoDB 2.4 database and run the method.

``ensureIndex`` and Existing Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()` now errors:

   - if you try to create an existing index but with different
     options; e.g. in the following example, the second
     :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()` will error.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.mycollection.ensureIndex( { x: 1 } )
        db.mycollection.ensureIndex( { x: 1 }, { unique: 1 } )

   - if you specify an index name that already exists but the key
     specifications differ; e.g. in the following example, the second
     :method:`db.collection.ensureIndex()` will error.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.mycollection.ensureIndex( { a: 1 }, { name: "myIdx" } )
        db.mycollection.ensureIndex( { z: 1 }, { name: "myIdx" } )

   Previous versions did not create the index but did not error.

.. _write-methods-incompatibility:

Write Method Acknowledgements
-----------------------------

Description
   The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell write methods
   :method:`db.collection.insert()`, :method:`db.collection.update()`,
   :method:`db.collection.save()` and :method:`db.collection.remove()`
   now integrate the :doc:`write concern </reference/write-concern>`
   directly into the method rather than with a separate
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` command to provide :ref:`acknowledgement of writes
   <wc-w>` whether run interactively in the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell or non-interactively in a script. In previous
   versions, these methods exhibited a "fire-and-forget" behavior.
   [#mongo-shell-gle-interactive]_

- Existing scripts for the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell that used these
  methods will now wait for acknowledgement, which take **longer** than
  the previous "fire-and-forget" behavior.

- The write methods now return a :method:`WriteResult` object that
  contains the results of the operation, including any write errors
  and write concern errors, and obviates the need to call
  :dbcommand:`getLastError` command to get the status of the results.
  See :method:`db.collection.insert()`,
  :method:`db.collection.update()`, :method:`db.collection.save()`
  and :method:`db.collection.remove()` for details.

- In sharded environments, :binary:`~bin.mongos` no longer supports
  "fire-and-forget" behavior. This limits throughput when writing data
  to sharded clusters.

.. [#mongo-shell-gle-interactive]
   In previous versions, when using the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
   interactively, the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell automatically called the
   :dbcommand:`getLastError` command after a write method to provide
   acknowledgement of the write. Scripts, however, would observe "fire-and-forget"
   behavior in previous versions unless the scripts included an
   **explicit** call to the :dbcommand:`getLastError` command after a
   write method.

Solution
  Scripts that used these :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell methods for bulk write
  operations with "fire-and-forget" behavior should use the
  :method:`Bulk()` methods.

  In sharded environments, applications using any driver or
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell should use :method:`Bulk()` methods for optimal
  performance when inserting or modifying groups of documents.

  For example, instead of:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     for (var i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++) {
         db.test.insert( { x : i } );
     }

  In MongoDB 2.6, replace with :method:`Bulk()` operation:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     var bulk = db.test.initializeUnorderedBulkOp();

     for (var i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++) {
         bulk.insert( { x : i} );
     }

     bulk.execute( { w: 1 } );

  Bulk method returns a :method:`BulkWriteResult` object that contains
  the result of the operation.

  .. seealso::
     :ref:`rel-notes-write-operations`,
     :method:`Bulk()`,
     :method:`Bulk.execute()`,
     :method:`db.collection.initializeUnorderedBulkOp()`,
     :method:`db.collection.initializeOrderedBulkOp()`

``db.collection.aggregate()`` Change
------------------------------------

Description
  The :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` method in the
  :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell defaults to returning a cursor to the results
  set. This change enables the aggregation pipeline to return result
  sets of any size and requires cursor iteration to access the result
  set. For example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

      var myCursor = db.orders.aggregate( [
          {
            $group: {
               _id: "$cust_id",
               total: { $sum: "$price" }
            }
          }
      ] );

      myCursor.forEach( function(x) { printjson (x); } );

  Previous versions returned a single document with a field ``results``
  that contained an array of the result set, subject to the :ref:`BSON
  Document size <limit-bson-document-size>` limit. Accessing the result
  set in the previous versions of MongoDB required accessing the
  ``results`` field and iterating the array. For example:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     var returnedDoc = db.orders.aggregate( [
         {
           $group: {
              _id: "$cust_id",
              total: { $sum: "$price" }
           }
         }
     ] );

     var myArray = returnedDoc.result; // access the result field

     myArray.forEach( function(x) { printjson (x); } );

Solution
  Update scripts that currently expect
  :method:`db.collection.aggregate()` to return a document with a
  ``results`` array to handle cursors instead.

.. seealso:: :ref:`rn-2.6-aggregation-cursor`,
   :method:`db.collection.aggregate()`,

Write Concern Validation
------------------------

Description
   Specifying a write concern that includes ``j: true`` to a
   :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance running with
   ``--nojournal`` option now errors. Previous versions would
   ignore the ``j: true``.

Solution
   Either remove the ``j: true`` specification from the write concern when
   issued against a :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance
   with ``--nojournal`` or run :binary:`~bin.mongod` or
   :binary:`~bin.mongos` with journaling.

Security Changes
----------------

.. _authentication-incompatibility:

New Authorization Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   MongoDB 2.6 :ref:`authorization model <authorization>` changes how
   MongoDB stores and manages user privilege information:

   - Before the upgrade, MongoDB 2.6 requires at least one user in the
     admin database.

   - MongoDB versions using older models cannot create/modify users or
     create user-defined roles.

Solution
   Ensure that at least one user exists in the admin database. If no
   user exists in the admin database, add a user. Then upgrade to
   MongoDB 2.6. Finally, upgrade the user privilege model. See
   :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-upgrade`.

   .. important::

      .. include:: /includes/important-upgrade-auth-model-prerequisites.rst

.. seealso:: :ref:`2.6-relnotes-security`

.. _ssl-hostname-validation:

SSL Certificate Hostname Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   The SSL certificate validation now checks the Common Name (``CN``)
   and the Subject Alternative Name (``SAN``) fields to ensure that
   either the ``CN`` or one of the ``SAN`` entries matches the hostname
   of the server. As a result, if you currently use SSL and *neither*
   the ``CN`` nor any of the ``SAN`` entries of your current SSL
   certificates match the hostnames, upgrading to version 2.6 will
   cause the SSL connections to fail.

Solution
   To allow for the continued use of these certificates, MongoDB
   provides the :setting:`~net.ssl.allowInvalidCertificates` setting. The
   setting is available for:

   - :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos` to bypass the validation
     of SSL certificates on other servers in the cluster.

   - :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell, :ref:`MongoDB tools that support SSL
     <mongodb-tools-support-ssl>`, and the C++ driver to bypass the
     validation of server certificates.

   When using the :setting:`~net.ssl.allowInvalidCertificates` setting, MongoDB
   logs as a warning the use of the invalid certificates.

   .. warning:: The :setting:`~net.ssl.allowInvalidCertificates` setting
      bypasses the other certificate validation, such as checks for
      expiration and valid signatures.

.. _2.6-2dsphere-version-incompatibility:

``2dsphere`` Index Version 2
----------------------------

Description
   MongoDB 2.6 introduces a version 2 of the :doc:`2dsphere index
   </core/2dsphere>`. If a document lacks a ``2dsphere``
   index field (or the field is ``null`` or an empty array), MongoDB
   does not add an entry for the document to the ``2dsphere`` index.
   For inserts, MongoDB inserts the document but does not add to the
   ``2dsphere`` index.

   Previous version would not insert documents where the ``2dsphere``
   index field is a ``null`` or an empty array. For documents that lack
   the ``2dsphere`` index field, previous versions would insert and
   index the document.

Solution
   To revert to old behavior, create the ``2dsphere`` index with ``{
   "2dsphereIndexVersion" : 1 }`` to create a version 1 index. However,
   version 1 index cannot use the new GeoJSON geometries.

.. seealso:: :ref:`2dsphere-v2`

Log Messages
------------

Timestamp Format Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
  Each message now starts with the timestamp format given in :ref:`2.6-time-format-changes`.
  Previous versions used the ``ctime`` format.

Solution
  MongoDB adds a new option ``--timeStampFormat`` which supports
  timestamp format in ``ctime``,
  ``iso8601-utc``, and ``iso8601-local`` (new default).

.. Commenting out the others for now -- they're just placeholders and notes for self
.. Other
   ~~~~~
   - ``query`` log messages add new field ``planSummary`.
   - ``getmore`` log messages now omit the ``query`` field.
   - :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell now calls :dbcommand:`isMaster` command
     instead of the ``admin`` command :dbcommand:`replSetGetStatus`
     during the construction of the shell prompt. Log messages change
     accordingly, as in the following
     .. code-block:: none
        command: { isMaster: 1.0, forShell: 1.0 } keyUpdates:0 numYields:0  reslen:178 0ms
   - In 2.6, log messages for write methods consist of a message for
     the method followed by a message for the associated write command.
     Previously, the messages consisted of a message for the method
     followed by a message for the ``getlasterror`` command. For example:
     .. code-block:: none
     2014-03-04T21:16:21.992-0500 [conn1] remove test.server12774 query: { a: { $lt: 3.0 } } ndeleted:2 keyUpdates:0 numYields:0 locks(micros) w:344 0ms
     2014-03-04T21:16:21.993-0500 [conn1] command test.$cmd command: { delete: "myCollection", deletes: [ { q: { a: { $lt: 3.0 } }, limit: 0.0 } ], ordered: true } keyUpdates:0 numYields:0  reslen:40 0ms
   - MongoDB removes the two blank lines preceding and following the:
     ``***** SERVER RESTARTED *****`` message.
   - ``writeback`` error message and ``FlushViewOfFile`` error message
     removes the space between the duration time and ``ms``.

Package Configuration Changes
-----------------------------

.. _2.6-default-bindip-incompatibility:

Default ``bindIp`` for RPM/DEB Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   In the official MongoDB packages in RPM (Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora
   Linux, and derivatives) and DEB (Debian, Ubuntu, and derivatives),
   the default :setting:`~net.bindIp` value attaches MongoDB components to
   the localhost interface *only*. These packages set this default in
   the default configuration file (i.e. ``/etc/mongod.conf``.)

Solution
   If you use one of these packages and have *not* modified the default
   ``/etc/mongod.conf`` file, you will need to set :setting:`~net.bindIp`
   before or during the upgrade.

There is no default :setting:`~net.bindIp` setting in any other official MongoDB
packages.

.. _2.6-snmp-iana-mib-incompatibility:

SNMP Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   - The IANA enterprise identifier for MongoDB changed from
     37601 to 34601.

   - MongoDB changed the MIB field name ``globalopcounts`` to
     ``globalOpcounts``.

Solution
   - Users of SNMP monitoring must modify their SNMP configuration
     (i.e. MIB) from 37601 to 34601.

   - Update references to ``globalopcounts`` to ``globalOpcounts``.

Remove Method Signature Change
------------------------------

Description
   :method:`db.collection.remove()` requires a query document as a
   parameter. In previous versions, the method invocation without a
   query document deleted all documents in a collection.

Solution
   For existing :method:`db.collection.remove()` invocations without a
   query document, modify the invocations to include an empty document
   :method:`db.collection.remove({})`.

.. _update-operations-incompatibility:

Update Operator Syntax Validation
---------------------------------

Description
  - :doc:`Update operators (e.g $set) </reference/operator/update>`
    must specify a non-empty operand expression. For example, the
    following expression is now invalid:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       { $set: { } }

  - :doc:`Update operators (e.g $set) </reference/operator/update>`
    cannot repeat in the update statement. For example, the following
    expression is invalid:

    .. code-block:: javascript

       { $set: { a: 5 }, $set: { b: 5 } }

.. COMMENT -- could clarify that the MongoDB server cannot accept
   update expressions that include duplicate operators so as to
   distinguish from drivers/mongo shell that will flatten out the
   expression, but will hold off until someone requests.

Updates Enforce Field Name Restrictions
---------------------------------------

Description
   - Updates cannot use :doc:`update operators (e.g $set)
     </reference/operator/update>` to target fields with empty field
     names (i.e. ``""``).

   - Updates no longer support saving field names that contain a dot
     (``.``) or a field name that starts with a dollar sign (``$``).

Solution
   - For existing documents that have fields with empty names ``""``,
     replace the whole document. See :method:`db.collection.update()`
     and :method:`db.collection.save()` for details on replacing an
     existing document.

   - For existing documents that have fields with names that contain a
     dot (``.``), either replace the whole document or :update:`unset
     <$unset>` the field. To find fields whose names contain a dot, run
     :v2.6:`db.upgradeCheckAllDBs() </reference/method/db.upgradeCheckAllDBs>`.

   - For existing documents that have fields with names that start with
     a dollar sign (``$``), :update:`unset <$unset>` or :update:`rename
     <$rename>` those fields. To find fields whose names start with a
     dollar sign, run :v2.6:`db.upgradeCheckAllDBs()
     </reference/method/db.upgradeCheckAllDBs>`.

See :ref:`rel-notes-write-operations` for the changes to the write
operation protocol, and :ref:`rel-notes-data-modification` for the
changes to the insert and update operations. Also consider the
documentation of the :limit:`Restrictions on Field Names`.

Query and Sort Changes
----------------------

.. _query-field-name-incompatibility:

Enforce Field Name Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   Queries cannot specify conditions on fields with names that start
   with a dollar sign (``$``).

Solution
   :update:`Unset <$unset>` or :update:`rename <$rename>` existing
   fields whose names start with a dollar sign (``$``). Run
   :v2.6:`db.upgradeCheckAllDBs()
   </reference/method/db.upgradeCheckAllDBs>` to find fields whose
   names start with a dollar sign.

.. _2.6-sparse-index-incompatibility:

Sparse Index and Incomplete Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   If a :doc:`sparse index </core/index-sparse>` results in an
   incomplete result set for queries and sort operations, MongoDB will
   not use that index unless a :method:`~cursor.hint()` explicitly
   specifies the index.

   For example, the query ``{ x: { $exists: false } }`` will no longer
   use a sparse index on the ``x`` field, unless explicitly hinted.

Solution
   To override the behavior to use the sparse index and return
   incomplete results, explicitly specify the index with a
   :method:`~cursor.hint()`.

See :ref:`sparse-index-incomplete-results` for an example that details
the new behavior.

.. _2.6-sort-value-incompatibility:

``sort()`` Specification Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   The :method:`~cursor.sort()` method **only** accepts the following
   values for the sort keys:

   - ``1`` to specify ascending order for a field,

   - ``-1`` to specify descending order for a field, or

   - :expression:`$meta` expression to specify sort by the text search
     score.

   Any other value will result in an error.

   Previous versions also accepted either ``true`` or ``false`` for
   ascending.

Solution
   Update sort key values that use ``true`` or ``false`` to ``1``.

.. _2.6-skip-incompatibility:

``skip()`` and ``_id`` Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   Equality match on the ``_id`` field obeys :method:`~cursor.skip()`.

   Previous versions ignored :method:`~cursor.skip()` when performing
   an equality match on the ``_id`` field.

.. _2.6-explain-query-plan-incompatibility:

``explain()`` Retains Query Plan Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   :method:`~cursor.explain()` no longer clears the :doc:`query plans
   </core/query-plans>` cached for that :term:`query shape`.

   In previous versions, :method:`~cursor.explain()` would have the
   side effect of clearing the query plan cache for that query shape.

.. seealso:: The :method:`PlanCache() <db.collection.getPlanCache()>` reference.

Geospatial Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _2.6-geo-maxDistance-incompatibility:

``$maxDistance`` Changes
````````````````````````

Description
   - For :query:`$near` queries on GeoJSON data, if the queries specify
     a :query:`$maxDistance`, :query:`$maxDistance` must be inside of
     the :query:`$near` document.

     In previous version, :query:`$maxDistance` could be either inside
     or outside the :query:`$near` document.

   - :query:`$maxDistance` must be a positive value.

Solution
   - Update any existing :query:`$near` queries on GeoJSON data that
     currently have the :query:`$maxDistance` outside the
     :query:`$near` document

   - Update any existing queries where :query:`$maxDistance` is a
     negative value.

.. _2.6-uniqueDocs-incompatibility:

Deprecated ``$uniqueDocs``
``````````````````````````

Description
   MongoDB 2.6 deprecates :query:`$uniqueDocs`, and geospatial queries
   no longer return duplicated results when a document matches the
   query multiple times.

.. _2.6-geospatial-validation-incompatibility:

Stronger Validation of Geospatial Queries
`````````````````````````````````````````

Description
   MongoDB 2.6 enforces a stronger validation of geospatial queries,
   such as validating the options or GeoJSON specifications, and errors
   if the geospatial query is invalid. Previous versions
   allowed/ignored invalid options.

Query Operator Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _2.6-not-incompatibility:

``$not`` Query Behavior Changes
```````````````````````````````

Description
   - Queries with :query:`$not` expressions on an indexed field now match:

     - Documents that are missing the indexed field. Previous versions
       would not return these documents using the index.

     - Documents whose indexed field value is a different type than
       that of the specified value. Previous versions would not return
       these documents using the index.

     For example, if a collection ``orders`` contains the following
     documents:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { _id: 1, status: "A", cust_id: "123", price: 40 }
        { _id: 2, status: "A", cust_id: "xyz", price: "N/A" }
        { _id: 3, status: "D", cust_id: "xyz" }

     If the collection has an index on the ``price`` field:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.orders.ensureIndex( { price: 1 } )

     The following query uses the index to search for documents where
     ``price`` is not greater than or equal to ``50``:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        db.orders.find( { price: { $not: { $gte: 50 } } } )

     In 2.6, the query returns the following documents:

     .. code-block:: javascript

         { "_id" : 3, "status" : "D", "cust_id" : "xyz" }
         { "_id" : 1, "status" : "A", "cust_id" : "123", "price" : 40 }
         { "_id" : 2, "status" : "A", "cust_id" : "xyz", "price" : "N/A" }

     In previous versions, indexed plans would only
     return matching documents where the type of the field matches the
     type of the query predicate:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        { "_id" : 1, "status" : "A", "cust_id" : "123", "price" : 40 }

     If using a collection scan, previous versions would return the
     same results as those in 2.6.

   - MongoDB 2.6 allows chaining of :query:`$not` expressions.

.. _2.6-null-incompatibility:

``null`` Comparison Queries
````````````````````````````

Description
   - :query:`$lt` and :query:`$gt` comparisons to ``null`` no
     longer match documents that are missing the field.

   - ``null`` equality conditions on array elements (e.g. ``"a.b":
     null``) no longer match document missing the nested field ``a.b``
     (e.g. ``a: [ 2, 3 ]``).

   - ``null`` equality queries (i.e. ``field: null`` ) now match fields
     with values ``undefined``.

.. _2.6-all-incompatibility:

``$all`` Operator Behavior Change
`````````````````````````````````

Description
   - The :query:`$all` operator is now equivalent to an :query:`$and`
     operation of the specified values. This change in behavior can
     allow for more matches than previous versions when passed an array
     of a single nested array (e.g. ``[ [ "A" ] ]``). When passed an
     array of a nested array, :query:`$all` can now match documents
     where the field contains the nested array as an element (e.g.
     ``field: [ [ "A" ], ... ]``), *or* the field equals the nested
     array (e.g. ``field: [ "A", "B" ]``). Earlier version could only
     match documents where the field contains the nested array.

   - The :query:`$all` operator returns no match if the array field
     contains nested arrays (e.g. ``field: [ "a", ["b"] ]``) and
     :query:`$all` on the nested field is the element of the nested
     array (e.g. ``"field.1": { $all: [ "b" ] }``). Previous versions
     would return a match.

.. _2.6-mod-operator-incompatibility:

``$mod`` Operator Enforces Strict Syntax
````````````````````````````````````````

Description
   The :query:`$mod` operator now only accepts an array with exactly
   two elements, and errors when passed an array with fewer or more
   elements. See :ref:`mod-not-enough-elements` and :ref:`mod-too-many-elements`
   for details.

   In previous versions, if passed an array with one element, the
   :query:`$mod` operator uses ``0`` as the second element, and if
   passed an array with more than two elements, the :query:`$mod`
   ignores all but the first two elements. Previous versions do return
   an error when passed an empty array.

Solution
   Ensure that the array passed to :query:`$mod` contains exactly two
   elements:

   - If the array contains the a single element, add ``0`` as the
     second element.

   - If the array contains more than two elements, remove the extra
     elements.

.. _2.6-where-incompatibility:

``$where`` Must Be Top-Level
````````````````````````````

Description
   :query:`$where` expressions can now only be at top level and cannot be
   nested within another expression, such as :query:`$elemMatch`.

Solution
   Update existing queries that nest :query:`$where`.

``$exists`` and ``notablescan``
```````````````````````````````

If the MongoDB server has disabled collection scans, i.e.
:parameter:`notablescan`, then :query:`$exists` queries that have no
*indexed solution* will error.

.. _2.6-min-max-key-equality-match-incompatibility:

``MinKey`` and ``MaxKey`` Queries
`````````````````````````````````

Description
   Equality match for either ``MinKey`` or
   ``MaxKey`` no longer match documents missing the field.

.. COMMENT will wait to doc the following in case the resolution
   matches the 2.4 behavior. :query:`$elemMatch` against nested arrays
   - SERVER-12496

Nested Array Queries with $elemMatch
````````````````````````````````````

Description
   The :query:`$elemMatch` query operator no longer traverses
   recursively into nested arrays.

   For example, if a collection ``test`` contains the following
   document:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      { "_id": 1, "a" : [ [ 1, 2, 5 ] ] }

   In 2.6, the following :query:`$elemMatch` query does *not* match the
   document:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      db.test.find( { a: { $elemMatch: { $gt: 1, $lt: 5 } } } )

Solution
   Update existing queries that rely upon the old behavior.

Text Search Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB does not support the use of the :query:`$text` query operator
in mixed sharded cluster deployments that contain both version 2.4
and version 2.6 shards. See :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-upgrade` for
upgrade instructions.

Replica Set/Sharded Cluster Validation
--------------------------------------

.. _2.6-metadata-check-incompatibility:

Shard Name Checks on Metadata Refresh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   For sharded clusters, MongoDB 2.6 disallows a shard from refreshing
   the metadata if the shard name has not been explicitly set.

   For mixed sharded cluster deployments that contain both version 2.4
   and version 2.6 shards, this change can cause errors when migrating
   chunks **from** version 2.4 shards **to** version 2.6 shards if the
   shard name is unknown to the version 2.6 shards. MongoDB does not
   support migrations in mixed sharded cluster deployments.

Solution
   Upgrade all components of the cluster to 2.6. See
   :doc:`/release-notes/2.6-upgrade`.

.. _2.6-repl-set-vote-incompatibility:

Replica Set Vote Configuration Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
   MongoDB now deprecates giving any :term:`replica set` member more
   than a single vote. During configuration,
   :rsconf:`members[n].votes` should only have a
   value of 1 for voting members and 0 for non-voting members. MongoDB
   treats values other than 1 or 0 as a value of 1 and produces a
   warning message.

Solution
   Update :rsconf:`members[n].votes` with values
   other than 1 or 0 to 1 or 0 as appropriate.

.. _2.6-time-format-changes:

Time Format Changes
-------------------

MongoDB now uses ``iso8601-local`` when formatting time data in many
outputs. This format follows the template
``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.mmm<+/-Offset>``. For example, ``2014-03-04T20:13:38.944-0500``.

This change impacts all clients using
:doc:`Extended JSON </reference/mongodb-extended-json>` in *Strict mode*, such as
:binary:`~bin.mongoexport`.
