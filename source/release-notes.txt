1.13.0 Changelog
----------------

*Released March 24, 2025*

New features:

- :ref:`Pre-Migration Analysis <rm-app-analysis>` is now in Public Preview. 
  This feature allows you to identify migration issues before starting and get
  actionable recommendations for a smooth migration. Pre Migration Analysis
  supports the following databases:
  
  - Oracle
  - SQL Server
  - PostgreSQL
  - MySQL

Bug fixes:

- Fixed an issue where job API calls would hang when table filters returned an
  empty result.
- Fixed an issue that prevented users from saving calculated key fields for 
  projects that use the single-inherited or wrapped key handling options.
- Fixed an issue with embedded array mappings and excluded fields, where blank 
  source data could trigger an 'unset' error rather than being processed silently.


1.12.0 Changelog
----------------

*Released February 3, 2025*

New features:

- Added support for four source databases, using JDBC connectivity to
  enable snapshot-based data migration and database object conversion from:

  - YugabyteDB
  - CockroachDB
  - SAP Sybase IQ (SAP IQ)
  - SAP SQL Anywhere
  
  .. note:: 
    JDBC connection support for these databases is currently in Public Preview.
    Users can also add custom relational database support by creating
    a custom JDBC connector.

- Added support for X.509 certificate authentication for client authentication on
  MongoDB target databases.
- Added information for MongoDB Atlas users attempting large data migrations to
  lower-tier MongoDB Atlas clusters which may result in extended migration time. For 
  large jobs where migration performance is a consideration, users may be able 
  to reduce total migration time by up to 54% by upgrading to a faster Atlas tier. 
- Added optional news section to inform users of new migrator tool capabilities,
  important upgrades and security announcements. This online-only feature can be
  disabled in user properties.
- Improved error reporting when skipping import of unsupported binary data types 
  in Microsoft SQL Server (FILESTREAM type) and Oracle (LONG, LONG RAW and BFILE types).
- Increased the maximum file size of supported DDL schemas file from 4MB to 20MB.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed an issue where Postgres created a duplicate replication slot in certain 
  scenarios. 



1.11.0 Changelog
----------------

*Released November 25, 2024*

New features:

- New database connection management feature makes it easier to save 
  and manage a large number of database connections, and switch between 
  database environments such as QA, dev or production.
- Improved query conversion by adding the option to use strongly-typed 
  Java entities in the signatures of converted queries.
- Added support for converting Oracle packages and SQL Server functions 
  in query converter.
- Added support for the latest Postgres 17 and MySQL 8.4/9.0 database 
  versions.
- Improved support for connecting to Oracle pluggable databases (PDBs).
- Added support to "Bring Your Own LLM" using a customer-managed LLM 
  service for AI code generation instead of the default MongoDB-hosted 
  service.

  when signed in with an Atlas account

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed an issue where a "No foreign key found" error could occur in some 
  cases with multiple foreign key embeddings.

  convert large numbers of SQL queries, views, and stored procedures. 
  See :ref:`rm-bulk-conversion`.
- Snapshot jobs now create top-level documents using a non-idempotent 
  bulk insert method. This improves performance.
- Added explicit control over idempotent behavior through the 
  ``migrator.engine.transform.idempotency: true`` setting in the 
  ``user.properties`` file.
- Internal indexes used for migration are automatically deleted
  after job completion. This improves performance.

  from being resized when it contained a large number of entries.

  were not routed through the system proxy.

  limit caused the job to stop immediately, instead of continuing 
  up to the error threshold. 
- Fixed an issue where data verification was unable to detect some 
  issues caused by precision differences between source and target 
  data types.
- Fixed an issue where each query could be imported twice.
- Fixed an issue where converted queries sometimes used incorrect 
  paths for embedded mappings.

  when the credentials were supplied with query string parameters.

  was not ready if the preflight test failed to run.

  deleted.
