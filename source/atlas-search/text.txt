Definition
----------

The ``text`` operator performs a full-text search using the :ref:`analyzer
<analyzers-ref>` that you specify in the :ref:`index configuration
<index-config-example>`. If you omit an analyzer, the ``text`` operator
uses the default :ref:`standard <ref-standard-analyzer>` analyzer.

.. _text-ref-syntax:

Syntax 
------

``text`` has the following syntax: 

.. code-block:: json 

   { 
     $search: {  
       "index": <index name>, // optional, defaults to "default"
       "text": {
         "query": "<search-string>",
         "path": "<field-to-search>",
         "fuzzy": <options>,
         "matchCriteria": "any" | "all"
         "score": <options>,
         "synonyms": "<synonyms-mapping-name>"
       }
     }
   }

.. _text-ref-fields:

Fields 
------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 10 60 10 
   
   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
     - Necessity
   
   * - ``query``
     - string or array of strings
     - The string or strings to search for. If there are multiple 
       terms in a string, |fts| also looks for a match for each term 
       in the string separately.
     - Required
   
   * - ``path``
     - string or array of strings
     - The indexed field or fields to search. You can also specify a 
       :ref:`wildcard path <ref-path-usage>` to search. See :ref:`path
       construction <ref-path>` for more information.
     - Required

   * - ``fuzzy``
     - document
     - Enable fuzzy search. Find strings which are similar to the
       search term or terms. You can't use ``fuzzy`` with ``synonyms``.
     - Optional

   * - ``fuzzy.maxEdits``
     - integer
     - Maximum number of single-character edits required to match the
       specified search term. Value can be ``1`` or ``2``. The default 
       value is ``2``. Uses `Damerau-Levenshtein distance 
       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance>`__.
     - Optional
  
   * - ``fuzzy.prefixLength``
     - integer
     - Number of characters at the beginning of each term in the result 
       that must exactly match. The default value is ``0``.
     - Optional

   * - ``fuzzy.maxExpansions``
     - integer
     - Maximum number of variations to generate and search for. 
       This limit applies on a per-token basis. The default value is 
       ``50``.
     - Optional

   * - ``matchCriteria``
     - string
     - Criteria to use to match the terms in the query. Value can be one
       of the following:

       - ``any`` - to return documents that contain any of the terms
         from the ``query`` field.  
       - ``all`` - to only return documents that contain all of the
         terms from the ``query`` field. 

       If omitted, defaults to ``all``. 
        
     - Optional, Recommended

   * - ``score``
     - document
     - Score assigned to matching search term results. Use one of 
       the following options to modify the score:

       - ``boost``: multiply the result score by the given number.
       - ``constant``: replace the result score with the given number.
       - ``function``: replace the result score using the given
         expression. 

       .. include:: /includes/fts/facts/fact-fts-array-scoring.rst

     - Optional

   * - ``synonyms`` 
     - string 
     - Required for running queries using :ref:`synonyms 
       <synonyms-ref>`.

       Name of the :ref:`synonym mapping definition <synonyms-ref>` in 
       the :ref:`index definition <ref-index-definitions>`. Value can't 
       be an empty string. You can't use ``fuzzy`` with ``synonyms``. 
       
       :gold:`IMPORTANT:` To use the ``synonyms`` option, you must index
       the query field as type ``string`` with the ``indexOptions``
       property set to ``positions`` or the default value, ``offsets``.
       To learn more, see :ref:`Configure String Field Properties
       <fts-field-types-string-options>`.  
       
       Always use ``matchCriteria`` when using ``synonyms``. For ``text``
       queries that use ``synonyms`` without ``matchCriteria``,
       |fts| only matches documents where all the terms are exactly in the
       same position as the query. This behavior might change in the
       future and your query results might also change.

       The amount of time that |fts| takes to execute queries that 
       use :ref:`synonym mappings <synonyms-ref>` depends on the 
       number and size of documents in the synonym source 
       collection. A query that uses a synonym mapping that is based 
       on very few synonym documents might be faster than a query 
       that uses a synonym mapping that is based on many synonym 
       documents.

     - Optional 

.. _text-ref-behavior:

Behavior 
--------

For ``text`` queries that use ``synonyms`` without ``matchCriteria``,
|fts| only matches documents which contain an exact match of the query terms
(with or without the expanded synonyms). 

This behavior might change in the future and your query results might
also change. To avoid service disruptions, always use ``matchCriteria``
when using ``synonyms``. Or, use synonyms with the :ref:`phrase-ref`
operator.
       
For example, suppose equivalent synonym mappings for ``nyc`` and ``new
york city``. A search for ``i like nyc`` returns the following:   

.. list-table:: 
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Operator Specification
     - Default Behavior 
     - ``"matchCriteria": "any"``
     - ``"matchCriteria": "all"`` 
       
   * - ``text`` without ``synonyms`` 
     - Matches ``i`` OR ``like`` OR ``nyc``
     - Matches ``i`` OR ``like`` OR ``nyc`` 
     - Matches ``i`` AND ``like`` AND ``nyc``

   * - ``text`` with ``synonyms`` 
     - Matches ``i like nyc`` OR ``i like new york city``
     - Matches ``i`` OR ``like`` OR (``nyc`` OR ``new york city``)
     - Matches ``i`` AND ``like`` AND (``nyc`` OR ``new york city``)

The amount of time that |fts| takes to execute queries that use
:ref:`synonym mappings <synonyms-ref>` depends on the number and size of
documents in the synonym source collection. A query that uses a synonym
mapping that is based on very few synonym documents might be faster than
a query that uses a synonym mapping that is based on many synonym
documents. 

.. _text-ref-examples:

Examples 
--------

The examples in this page use the ``movies`` collection in the
``sample_mflix`` database. After loading the :ref:`sample dataset
<available-sample-datasets>` into your {+cluster+}, create the |fts|
index with dynamic mappings and run the example queries on your
{+cluster+}. You must also define a ``synonyms`` mapping collection in the  
index as shown in the :ref:`synonyms-index-definition-ex` to try the
:ref:`synonyms <text-ref-synonyms-eg>` examples below.

Basic Example 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following |fts| example uses the ``text`` operator to search the 
``title`` field in the ``movies`` collection for the term ``surfer``. 

.. example:: 
   
   The following query searches the ``title`` field for the term ``surfer``. 
   It includes a :manual:`$project </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` 
   stage to: 

   - Exclude all fields except ``title``
   - Add a field named ``score``

   .. io-code-block:: 
      :copyable: true 

      .. input:: 
         :language: json 

         db.movies.aggregate([
           {
             $search: {
               "text": {
                 "path": "title",
                 "query": "surfer"
               }
             }
           },
           {

             }
           }
         ])

Fuzzy Examples 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following queries use the ``text`` operator to search the 
``title`` field in the ``movies`` collection for terms that are within 
one character variation of each term in the ``query`` phrase ``naw 
yark``. |fts| returns different results depending on whether you use the 
default ``fuzzy`` options or define the ``maxExpansions``, ``prefixLength``, 
or ``maxEdits`` fields. 

Click the following tabs for example queries that use
default and specified options:

.. tabs::
   
   tabs:
     - id: default
       name: Default Example
       content: |

         .. example:: 
   
            The following query searches the ``title`` field for the 
            phrase ``naw yark``. It uses the ``fuzzy`` default options 
            where: 

            - ``maxEdits`` allows up to two character variation of each 
              term in the given phrase to match the query to a document.
            - ``maxExpansions`` considers up to fifty similar terms for 
              each term in ``naw yark`` to find matches.
            - ``prefixLength`` is disabled. 

            The query also includes a :manual:`$limit 
            </reference/operator/aggregation/limit>` stage to limit the 
            output to 10 results and a :manual:`$project 
            </reference/operator/aggregation/project>` stage to: 

            - Exclude all fields except ``title``
            - Add a field named ``score``
