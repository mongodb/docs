To modify a deployment's configuration, edit the
:svc-cat:`ServiceInstance </resources/#serviceinstance>` resource for a
replica set or sharded cluster.

Prerequisites
-------------

To edit an |service| cluster, you must have:

1. The {+osb+} :doc:`installed </installation>` and
#. :doc:`At least one database deployed </deploy>`.

Considerations
--------------

When editing an |service| cluster through the {+osb+}, you cannot:

- Edit members of your replica sets.
- Edit members of a shard in your sharded clusters.
- Change the cloud service provider of your |service| cluster.

Procedure
---------

1. Open the ``ServiceInstance`` |yaml| file for the replica set or
   sharded cluster that you want to edit in your preferred text editor.

#. Change or add any settings.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-additional-resource-settings.rst

#. Save the ``ServiceInstance`` |yaml| file.

#. Invoke the following command to update the resource:

   .. code-block:: sh

      kubectl apply -f <SERVICE_INSTANCE>.yaml
