This page outlines common connection issues and possible resolutions.

Cluster :guilabel:`Connect` button is disabled
----------------------------------------------

Your cluster :guilabel:`Connect` button may be disabled if your
cluster is in the provisioning state. Your cluster needs to provision
when it is first deployed, or when it is
:doc:`scaled up or down </scale-cluster>`. The provisoning process can
take up to 10 minutes, after which the :guilabel:`Connect` button will
become enabled.

Too many open connections to your cluster
-----------------------------------------

|service| sets the limit for concurrent incoming connections to a
cluster based on the cluster's instance size. If you try to connect
when you are at this limit, MongoDB displays an error stating
"connection refused because too many open connections".

For a detailed comparision of instance sizes and their maximum
concurrent connections, see :doc:`/connection-limits/`.

Possible Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Close any open connections to your cluster not currently in use.

- :doc:`Scale your cluster </scale-cluster>` to a higher tier to
  support more concurrent connections.

- Restart your application.

- To prevent this issue in the future, consider utilizing the
  :urioption:`maxPoolSize` connection string option to limit the
  number of connections in the connection pool.

   For more details on fixing this issue, see the
   :doc:`/reference/alert-resolutions/connection-alerts` page.

Authentication to the cluster failed
------------------------------------

To connect to |service|, you must authenticate with a MongoDB user.
To create a MongoDB user for your cluster, see
:doc:`security-add-mongodb-users/`.

Possible Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have created a user and are having trouble authenticating,
try the following:

- Check that you are using the correct username and password for
  your MongoDB user, and that you are connecting to the correct
  cluster.

- Check that you are specifying the correct ``authSource`` database in
  your connection string.

- If you have a special character in your password, see
  :ref:`Special characters in connection string password
  <special-pass-characters>`.

Attempting to connect to a cluster from behind a firewall
---------------------------------------------------------

|service| clusters operate on port ``27017``. You must be able to reach
this port to connect to your clusters.

To check your ability to reach this port, visit
http://portquiz.net:27017. If you cannot access port ``27017``,
check your system firewall settings and ensure they are not
blocking access to this port.

.. _special-pass-characters:

Special characters in connection string password
------------------------------------------------

If you have special characters in your connection string password, you
must encode those characters. For a complete list of special characters
and their corresponding encodings, see the
`ASCII Codes Table <https://ascii.cl/>`__. Use the corresponding
:guilabel:`Hex` value for your characters.

.. example::

   If your password in plain-text is ``p@ssw0rd'9'!``, you would need
   to encode your password as:

   .. code-block:: none
      :copyable: false

      p%40ssw0rd%279%27%21

Connection string incompatible with driver version
--------------------------------------------------

If you see this error message, your driver is likely out of date. For
instructions on updating your driver, refer to your specific
:driver:`Driver Documentation <>`.

MongoDB Compass Troubleshooting
-------------------------------

If you are using |compass| to connect to your cluster, you can visit
the :compass:`Compass Connection Errors
</current/troubleshooting/connection-errors/>` page for additional
troubleshooting resources.
