       The string on which you wish to apply the |regexpattern|.
       Can be a string or any valid :ref:`expression
       <aggregation-expressions>` that resolves to a string.

   The regex pattern to apply. Can be any valid :ref:`expression
   <aggregation-expressions>` that resolves to either a string or regex
   pattern ``/<pattern>/``. When using the regex ``/<pattern>/``, you
   can also specify the regex options ``i`` and ``m`` (but not the
   ``s`` or ``x`` options):

   - ``"pattern"``
   
   - ``/<pattern>/``

   - ``/<pattern>/<options>`` 

   Alternatively, you can also specify the regex options with the
   |regexoptions| field. To specify the ``s`` or ``x`` options, you
   must use the |regexoptions| field.

   You cannot specify options in both the ``regex`` and the ``options``
   field.

   *Optional*. The following ``<options>`` are available for use
   with regular expression.
   
   You cannot specify options in both the ``regex`` and the ``options`` field.
   
   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Option
        - Description

      * - ``i``
        
        - Case insensitivity to match both upper and lower cases. You
          can specify the option in the ``options`` field or as part of
          the regex field.

      * - ``m``

        - For patterns that include anchors (i.e. ``^`` for the start,
          ``$`` for the end), match at the beginning or end of each
          line for strings with multiline values. Without this option,
          these anchors match at beginning or end of the string.

          If the pattern contains no anchors or if the string value has
          no newline characters (e.g. ``\n``), the ``m`` option has no
          effect.

      * - ``x``

        - "Extended" capability to ignore all white space characters
          in the pattern unless escaped or included in a character
          class.

          Additionally, it ignores characters in-between and including
          an un-escaped hash/pound (``#``) character and the next new
          line, so that you may include comments in complicated
          patterns. This only applies to data characters; white space
          characters may never appear within special character
          sequences in a pattern.

          The ``x`` option does not affect the handling of the VT
          character (i.e. code 11).
          
          You can specify the option only in the ``options`` field.

      * - ``s``

        - Allows the dot character (i.e. ``.``) to match all
          characters *including* newline characters.

          You can specify the option only in the ``options`` field.
