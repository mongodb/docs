This procedure outlines the process for taking MongoDB data and
restoring that data into a new :term:`replica set`. Use this approach
for seeding test deployments from production backups as well as part
of disaster recovery.

You *cannot* restore a single data set to three new
:binary:`~bin.mongod` instances and *then* create a replica set. In this
situation MongoDB will force the secondaries to perform an initial
sync. The procedures in this document describe the correct and
efficient ways to deploy a replica set.

Restore Database into a Single Node Replica Set

Add Members to the Replica Set
------------------------------

MongoDB provides two options for restoring secondary members of a
replica set:

- Manually copy the database files to each data directory.

- Allow :ref:`initial sync <replica-set-initial-sync>` to distribute
  data automatically.

The following sections outlines both approaches.

.. note::

   If your database is large, initial sync can take a long time to
   complete. For large databases, it might be preferable to copy the
   database files onto each host.

Copy Database Files and Restart :binary:`~bin.mongod` Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following sequence of operations to "seed" additional members
of the replica set with the restored data by copying MongoDB data
files directly.

Update Secondaries using Initial Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following sequence of operations to "seed" additional members
of the replica set with the restored data using the default *initial
sync* operation.
