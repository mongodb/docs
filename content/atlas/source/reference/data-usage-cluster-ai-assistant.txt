MongoDB AI Cluster Assistant and Usage Information
---------------------------------------------------

The MongoDB AI Cluster Assistant is an AI assistant that is designed to 
answer questions about MongoDB's cluster features and offer recommendations 
to create or upgrade a cluster. You can directly apply that recommendation 
in |service| to create or upgrade your cluster. The chatbot is powered by 
generative AI and may give inaccurate responses. See our `Generative AI FAQ 
<https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/faq-ai-features>`__ for more information.

The chatbot is available within the {+atlas-ui+}.

Third Party Providers
---------------------

This feature currently uses the `Azure OpenAI Service 
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__ 
hosted by Microsoft. This is subject to change in the future.

How Your Data is Used
---------------------

When you use the AI Cluster Assistant in |service|, the following 
information may be sent to MongoDB's backend and/or the third-party AI 
provider.

- The full text of your prompt.
- Configurations of the cluster you are editing, including instance size, 
  cluster name, and settings per node or per shard.
- Configurations of other clusters within the same project.

The information that is sent will not be stored by the AI provider. We do 
not send unsanitized connection strings, credentials, or rows/documents 
from your databases.

What If I Prefer Not to Use the Chatbot?
-----------------------------------------

The AI Cluster Creation chatbot respects organization level generative AI 
settings and will not be available if your organization disables generative AI
features across all projects from `Organization Settings 
<https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/org/69222872fdbcd54ca68d7374/settings/general>`__. 
To do so, toggle off :guilabel:`Enable Atlas features that use generative AI`.
If enabled, developers who have access to :guilabel:`Create Cluster`
in the {+atlas-ui+} will optionally be able to use the feature.

Currently, our AI Cluster Assistant chatbot is a part of our platform's 
support system and cannot be individually disabled per project. However, 
interaction with the AI Cluster Assistant chatbot is entirely optional.
