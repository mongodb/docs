===========================================
Deploy MongoDB with Kerberos Authentication
===========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. versionadded:: 2.4

The MongoDB Subscriber Edition supports authentication using a
Kerberos service to manage the authentication process. Kerberos is an
industry standard authentication protocol for large client/server
system. With Kerberos MongoDB and application ecosystems can take
advantage of existing authentication infrastructure and processes.

Setting up and configuring a Kerberos deployment is beyond the scope
of this document. In order to use MongoDB with Kerberos, you must
have a properly configured Kerberos deployment and the ability to
generate a valid *keytab* file for each :program:`mongod` instance in
your MongoDB deployment.

.. note::

   The following assumes that you have a valid Kerberos keytab file
   for your realm accessible on your system. The examples below assume
   that the keytab file is valid and is located at
   ``/opt/mongodb/mongod.keytab`` and is *only* accessible to the user
   that runs the :program:`mongod` process.

Process Overview
----------------

To run MongoDB with Kerberos support, you must:

- Configure a Kerberos service principal for each :program:`mongod`
  and :program:`mongos` instance in your MongoDB deployment.

- Generate and distribute keytab files for each MongoDB component
  (i.e. :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos`)in your
  deployment. Ensure that you *only* transmit keytab files over secure
  channels.

- Optional. Start the :program:`mongod` instance *without*
  :setting:`auth` and create users inside of MongoDB that you can use
  to bootstrap your deployment.

- Start :program:`mongod` and :program:`mongos` with the
  ``KERB5_KTNAME`` environment variable as well as a number of required
  run time options.

- If you did not create Kerberos user accounts, you can use the
  :ref:`localhost exception <auth-localhost-exception>` to create users
  at this point until you create the first user on the ``admin``
  database.

- Authenticate clients, including the :program:`mongo` shell using
  Kerberos.

Operations
----------

Create Privilege Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For every user that you want to be able to authenticate using Kerberos,
you must create corresponding privilege documents in the
:data:`system.users <<database>.system.users` collection to provision
access to users. Consider the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     user: "application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET",
     roles: ["read"],
     userSource: "$external"
   }

This grants the Kerberos user principal
``application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET`` read only access to a
database. The :data:`~<database>.system.users.userSource`
``$external`` reference allows :program:`mongod` to consult an
external source (i.e. Kerberos) to authenticate this user.

In the :program:`mongo` shell you can pass the :method:`db.addUser()`
a user privilege document to provision access to users. To remove
access to a user, use the :method:`~db.collection.remove()` method, as
in the following example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.system.users.remove( { user: "application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET" } )

Start ``mongod`` with Kerberos Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have provisioned privileges to users in the
:program:`mongod`, *and* obtained a valid keytab file, you must start
:program:`mongod` using a command in the following form:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=<path to keytab file> <mongod invocation>

For successful operation with :program:`mongod` use the following run
time options in addition to your normal default configuration options:

- :option:`--setParameter <mongod  --setParameter>` with the
  ``authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI`` argument to enable support for
  Kerberos.

- :option:`--auth <mongod --auth>` to enable authentication.

- :option:`--keyFile <mongod --keyFile>` to allow components of a
  single MongoDB deployment to communicate with each other, if needed
  to support replica set and sharded cluster
  operations. :setting:`keyFile` implies :setting:`auth`.

For example, consider the following invocation:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=/opt/mongodb/mongod.keytab \
       /opt/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath /opt/mongodb/data \
       --fork --logpath /opt/mongodb/log/mongod.log \
       --auth --setParameter authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI

You can also specify these options using the configuration
file. As in the following:

.. code-block:: none

   # /opt/mongodb/mongod.conf, Example configuration file.

   fork = true
   auth = true

   dbpath = /opt/mongodb/data
   logpath = /opt/mongodb/log/mongod.log
   setParameter = authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI

To use this configuration file, start :program:`mongod` as in the
following:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=/opt/mongodb/mongod.keytab \
       /opt/mongodb/bin/mongod --config /opt/mongodb/mongod.conf

To start a :program:`mongos` instance using Kerberos, you must create
a Kerberos service principal and deploy a keytab file for this
instance, and then start the :program:`mongos` with the following
invocation:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=/opt/mongodb/mongos.keytab \
       /opt/mongodb/bin/mongos
       --configdb shard0.example.net,shard1.example.net,shard2.example.net \
       --setParameter authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI \
       --keyFile /opt/mongodb/mongos.keyfile

If you encounter problems when trying to start :program:`mongod` or
:program:`mongos`,

Authenticate ``mongo`` Shell with Kerberos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To connect to a :program:`mongod` instance using the :program:`mongo`
shell you must begin by using the ``kinit`` program to initialize and
authenticate a Kerberos session. Then, start a :program:`mongo`
instance, and use the :method:`db.auth()` method, to authenticate
against the special ``$external`` database, as in the following
operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   use $external
   db.auth( { mechanism: "GSSAPI", user: "application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET" } )

Alternately, you can authenticate using command line options to
:program:`mongo`, as in the following equivalent example:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongo --authenticationMechanism=GSSAPI --authenticationDatabase='$external' \
   -u application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET

These operations authenticates the Kerberos principal name
``application/reporting@EXAMPLE.NET`` to the connected
:program:`mongod`, and will automatically acquire all available
privileges as needed.

Use MongoDB Drivers to Authenticate with Kerberos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the time of release, the C++, Java, C#, and Python drivers all
provide support for Kerberos authentication to MongoDB. Consider the
following tutorials for more information:

- :ecosystem:`Java </tutorial/authenticate-with-java-driver/>`
- :ecosystem:`C# </tutorial/authenticate-with-csharp-driver/>`

.. uncomment wen links exist.
   - :ecosystem:`Python </tutorial/authenticate-with-python-driver/>`
   - :ecosystem:`C++ </tutorial/authenticate-with-cpp-driver/>`

Troubleshooting
---------------

Kerberos Configuration Checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're having trouble getting :program:`mongod` to start with
Kerberos, there are a number of Kerberos-specific issues that can
prevent successful authentication. As you begin troubleshooting
your Kerberos deployment, ensure that:

- The :program:`mongod` is from the MongoDB Subscriber Edition.

- You have a valid keytab file specified in the
  environment running the :program:`mongod`. For the :program:`mongod`
  instance running on the ``db0.example.net`` host, the service
  principal should be ``mongodb/db0.example.net``.

- DNS allows the :program:`mongod` to resolve the components of the
  Kerberos infrastructure. You should have both ``A`` and ``PTR``
  records (i.e. forward and reverse DNS) for the system that runs
  the :program:`mongod` instance.

- The canonical system hostname of the system that runs the
  :program:`mongod` instance is the resolvable fully qualified
  domain for this host. Test system hostname resolution with the
  ``hostname -f`` command at the system prompt.

- Both the Kerberos *KDC* and the system running :program:`mongod`
  instance must be able to resolve each other using DNS [#kerb5-conf]_

- The time systems of the systems running the :program:`mongod`
  instances and the Kerberos infrastructure are synchronized. Time
  differences greater than 5 minutes will prevent successful
  authentication.

.. coming soon: error messages and their approximate meaning

If you still encounter problems with Kerberos, you can start both
:program:`mongod` and :program:`mongo` (or another client) with the
environment variable ``KRB5_TRACE`` set to different files to produce
more verbose logging of the Kerberos process to help further
troubleshooting, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: sh

   env KRB5_KTNAME=/opt/mongodb/mongod.keytab \
       KRB5_TRACE=/opt/mongodb/log/mongodb-kerberos.log \
       /opt/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath /opt/mongodb/data \
       --fork --logpath /opt/mongodb/log/mongod.log \
       --auth --setParameter authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI

.. [#kerb5-conf] By default, Kerberos attempts to resolve hosts using
   the content of the ``/etc/kerb5.conf`` before using DNS to resolve
   hosts.

Enable the Traditional MongoDB Authentication Mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For testing and development purposes you can enable both the Kerberos
(i.e. ``GSSAPI``) authentication mechanism in combination with the
traditional MongoDB challenge/response authentication mechanism
(i.e. ``MONGODB-CR``), using the following :setting:`setParameter`
run-time option:

.. code-block:: sh

   mongod --setParaemter authenticationMechanisms=GSSAPI,MONGODB-CR

.. warning::

   All :setting:`keyFile` *internal* authentication between members of
   a :term:`replica set` or :term:`sharded cluster` still uses the
   ``MONGODB-CR`` authentication mechanism, even if ``MONGODB-CR`` is
   not enabled. All client authentication will still use Kerberos.
