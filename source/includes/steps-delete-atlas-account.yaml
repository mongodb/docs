   You are prompted to verify your identity:

   - If you use |mfa|, you are prompted verify your identity with your 
     chosen |mfa-short| authentication method.
    
   - If you use Google SSO, MongoDB 
     sends a code to your email address. Use that code to verify your 
     identity. Accounts that use Google SSO are automatically 
     unlinked as part of the account deletion process.
     
   - If you don't have |mfa| configured and don't use Google SSO, 
     you are prompted to re-verify your password. Then, MongoDB sends a 
     code to your email address. Use that code to finish verifying your 
     identity.

   Your account is deleted.
