ref: _core-dropIndexes-query-behavior
content: |

  Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the {{dropIndex}} operation only kills
  queries that are using the index being dropped. This may include
  queries considering the index as part of   
  :ref:`query planning <query-plans-query-optimization>`.

  Prior to MongoDB 4.2, dropping an index on a
  collection would kill all open queries on the collection.
