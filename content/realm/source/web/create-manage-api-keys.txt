Overview
--------

You can use the Web SDK to create and manage :ref:`user API keys
<api-key-authentication-user-api-key>` that allow services to log in and
interact with your app on behalf of an existing user without requiring the user
to re-authenticate.

User API keys are managed as part of the :ref:`API Key authentication provider
<api-key-authentication>` but may only be created for users associated with a
different, non-anonymous authentication provider.

User objects in the Web SDK include an ``ApiKeyAuth`` object that exposes
methods to work with that user's API keys.

.. _web-api-key-create-user-key:

Create a User API Key
---------------------

To create a new user API key, call ``ApiKeyAuth.create()`` with an identifying
name for the key. The name must be a string that's unique among all of the
user's API keys.

.. _web-api-key-look-up-user-key:

Look up a User API Key
----------------------

To get an array that lists all of a user's API keys, call
``ApiKeyAuth.fetchAll()``. You can also find a specific API key by calling
``ApiKeyAuth.fetch()`` with the key's ``_id``.

   :language: javascript

.. _web-api-key-enable-disable:

Enable or Disable an API Key
----------------------------

You can enable or disable a user API key by calling ``ApiKeyAuth.enable()`` or
``ApiKeyAuth.disable()`` with the key's ``_id``. When a key is disabled, it
cannot be used to log in on behalf of the user.

   :language: javascript

.. _web-api-key-delete:

Delete an API Key
-----------------

You can permanently delete a user API key by calling ``ApiKeyAuth.delete()``
with the key's ``_id``. Deleted keys can no longer be used to log in on behalf
of the user.
