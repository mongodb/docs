   :description: Configure SQL Server for migration jobs by enabling CDC at the database and table levels, using scripts generated by Relational Migrator.

To run migration jobs from a SQL Server source database, 
the database may require some configuration changes. Before you start a 
migration job, Relational Migrator checks if the 
database is configured correctly. If Relational Migrator determines the 
database needs configuration changes, it automatically generates a 
SQL script with the required changes. It is recommended to have a 
Database Administrator (DBA) review the commands in this script and 
perform their execution on the database server. This topic 
provides more details on the required configuration steps. SQL Server 
configuration depends on the type of migration job:

About this Task
---------------

- This page covers the details of the SQL scripts automatically 
  generated by Relational Migrator.

- Relational Migrator automatically detects configuration settings when 
  connecting to your database and generates the appropriate SQL 
  statements to enable CDC if required.

- Relational Migrator does not create any indexes on SQL Server to 
  facilitate migration jobs. The create index creation permission is not 
  required.

Steps
-----

The easiest way to set up your database is to run the automatically 
generated script that Relational Migrator prompts you to download when
you :ref:`create a migration job <rm-create-jobs>`. To  understand the 
permissions or run the SQL manually, read the procedures below.

Configure your SQL Server instance based on the migration job type. 
Refer to the tab below for details on snapshot and continuous migration 
job configurations.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Snapshot Jobs
      :tabid: enable-snapshot-jobs

      For snapshot jobs against SQL Server, you must enable 
      CDC at the database level. 

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Configure CDC at the Database Level

          Enabling CDC at the database-level CDC generates a small 
          number of system tables in the database, leaving user tables 
          unchanged, and does not add any performance overhead. Enabling
          CDC alone does not result in changes being captured.

         .. include:: /includes/fact-enable-cdc-database.rst

   .. tab:: Continuous Jobs
      :tabid: enable-continuous-jobs

      For continuous jobs against SQL Server, you must enable 
      CDC at both the database level and at the table level for 
      each table.

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

         .. step:: Configure CDC at the database level

            .. include:: /includes/fact-enable-cdc-database.rst

         .. step:: Enable the SQL Server agent and check database permissions

            To enable the CDC option at the table level:

            a. You must have the server level ``sysadmin`` role. 
            #. You must have the database level ``db_owner`` role.
            #. The `SQL Server agent <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/agent/sql-server-agent?view=sql-server-ver16>`__
               must be running.
            #. The service account used to connect to SQL Server 
               must have Select permission against all required tables.

         .. step:: Configure CDC at the table level

            To enable CDC at the table level
            use the ``sys.sp_cdc_enable_table`` stored procedure. 

            You can check the SQL Server CDC settings when viewing the ``is_tracked_by_cdc`` 
            column in the `sys.tables catalog view <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-tables-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16>`__. 
            A value of ``1`` for ``is_tracked_by_cdc`` indicates the table 
            is enabled for change data capture.

            The code block below is a sample of the 
            automatically generated code.You can run the code manually 
            to enable table CDC:

            .. code-block:: sql
               :copyable: true

               USE MyDB
               GO
               EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table
               @source_schema = N'dbo',
               @source_name   = N'MyTable',
               @role_name     = N'MyRole',
               @filegroup_name = N'MyDB_CT',
               @supports_net_changes = 1
               GO

Relational Migrator relies on the open-source Debezium connector to 
capture row-level changes. For more details, see
