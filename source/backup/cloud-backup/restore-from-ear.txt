|service| lets you restore data from a snapshot of a {+cluster+} using
{+encrypt-at-rest+}

Restore Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-restore-reqs.rst

- This feature is only available for ``M10+`` dedicated {+clusters+}.

- |service| can only restore to a {+cluster+} that uses the same 
  encryption provider as the source {+cluster+}. Snapshots taken from 
  {+clusters+} without {+encrypt-at-rest+} cannot be restored to a 
  {+cluster+} with it, or to a |mms| project.

- When you run an automated restore for an |service| {+cluster+} from a different project
  with Encryption at Rest, the |aws| |kms| key value for both clusters must be the same.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-restore-cluster-downtime-warning.rst

.. important::

   If the target project doesn't have a {+cluster+} with Encryption at
   Rest enabled, you can either
   :ref:`deploy <create-cluster-enable-encryption>` a {+cluster+} with
   Encryption at Rest, or
   :ref:`enable Encryption at Rest <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>`
   in an existing {+cluster+}.

   Clusters that use :ref:`AWS KMS <security-aws-kms>` encrypt their
   |pit| restore :term:`oplog` data with the customer's |cmk|. The
   current |cmk| must be valid for the encrypted oplog data to perform
   a restore from a snapshot.

#. Click :guilabel:`Database` in the top-left corner of |service|.

#. From the :guilabel:`{+Database-Deployments+}` view, click on the 
   cluster name.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Backup` tab.

   If the cluster has no :guilabel:`Backup` tab, then |service| backups
   are disabled for that cluster and no snapshots are available.
   You can enable backups when
   :ref:`modifying the cluster <scale-cluster-backups>`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Restore` in the :guilabel:`Actions` column
   for the snapshot you want to restore.

#. From the :guilabel:`Restore` dialog, select the target |service|
   :guilabel:`Project` to which you want to restore. You can restore to
   any |service| project for which the authenticated |service| user has
   the :authrole:`Project Owner` role.

#. Select the :guilabel:`Cluster` to restore to. You can only restore
   to an |service| replica set running Encryption at Rest. The target
   cluster must run the same or greater version of MongoDB as the
   :guilabel:`MongoDB Version` of the snapshot.

   After the restoration procedure, |service| triggers a key rotation
   for MongoDB encryption key. |service| then encrypts the new MongoDB
   encryption keys based on the configured Encryption at Rest provider
   for the target cluster.

#. Restart your application and ensure it uses the new target
   cluster.

Troubleshooting Encryption at Rest
``````````````````````````````````

If |service| has an issue with the encryption of either the snapshot
or the target cluster, it displays one of the following errors:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :stub-columns: 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Error

     - Result

   * - Cannot restore a non-encrypted snapshot to a cluster with
       Encryption at Rest enabled.

     - The snapshot cannot be restored to |service|.

   * - Target cluster does not have encryption enabled.

     - You can either :ref:`deploy <create-cluster-enable-encryption>`
       a new target cluster with Encryption at Rest, or
       :ref:`enable Encryption at Rest <scale-cluster-enable-encryption>`
       on your desired target cluster.

   * - Encryption provider of target cluster does not match selected
       snapshot's encryption provider.

     - The encryption provider for the snapshot and target cluster
       do not match. You can either:

       1. Create a new snapshot with the same encryption provider.
       #. Change the encryption provider for the target cluster.

   * - Encryption credentials on snapshot are not present.

     - |service| cannot restore a snapshot whose encryption key was
       deleted.
