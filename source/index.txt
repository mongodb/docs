|service-fullname| is a cloud service for running and maintaining
MongoDB deployments, including the provisioning of dedicated servers
for the MongoDB instances.

Cluster
-------

MongoDB deployments, or "clusters" in |service|, can be either a
:term:`sharded cluster` or a :term:`replica set`. For the deployments,
|service| uses the latest stable release of MongoDB with the WiredTiger
storage engine. |service| also provides an interface through which to
monitor, manage and configure your MongoDB clusters.
