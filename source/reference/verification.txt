When :ref:`mongosync <c2c-mongosync>` has fully committed, verify the 
successful transfer of your data before you switch your application to using 
the destination cluster. You can verify your data transfer using document 
counts, hash comparison, document comparison, or the Migration Verifier.

Use Cases
---------

You should verify your data after every sync. This is important in
cases where you plan to move your application load from the source to the
destination cluster.

Verification methods:

- :ref:`c2c-verify-with-doc-counts`

- :ref:`c2c-verify-with-hash-comp`

- :ref:`c2c-verify-with-doc-comp`

- :ref:`c2c-verify-with-verifier`

The specific method you use to verify your data depends on your application
workload and the complexity of the data.

Tasks
-------

.. _c2c-verify-with-doc-counts:

Document Counts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most basic method of verification is to compare the number of documents
in each synced collection on the source cluster to the number on the
destination cluster.

This method only verifies a successful sync when run against clusters with
insert-only workloads.

For more information, see :ref:`c2c-verify-doc-counts`.

.. _c2c-verify-with-hash-comp:

Hash Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can verify sync by comparing MD5 hashes of collections synced from the
source cluster to the destination cluster.

While hash comparison ensures that the destination cluster has received all
changes from the source, the :dbcommand:`dbHash` command locks the cluster,
preventing additional writes until it completes.

.. note::

   Hash comparison is not possible with sharded clusters. It also does not
   work for standalone servers and replica sets that use MongoDB 4.4 or earlier
   releases, since the document field order can vary.

For more information, see :ref:`c2c-verify-hash-comp`.

.. _c2c-verify-with-doc-comp:

Document Comparison
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can verify sync by comparing documents on the source and destination
clusters. Write a script that queries collections on the source cluster and
then checks that the document exists with the same values on the destination
cluster.

.. _c2c-verify-with-verifier:

Migration Verifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Migration Verifier connects to the source and destination clusters and performs
a series of verification checks, comparing documents, views, and indexes to
confirm the sync was successful.

.. important::

   Migration Verifier is an experimental and unsupported tool.

   For installation instructions, see
   `GitHub <https://github.com/mongodb-labs/migration-verifier>`__.

Unlike other verification methods, Migration Verifier can run concurrent
with ``mongosync``, checking documents on the destination cluster as they
sync.

For more information, see :ref:`c2c-migration-verifier`.
