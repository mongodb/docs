    Once you have :doc:`installed </install>` |compass-short| and the
    program is running, an initial connection dialog appears:

    .. figure:: /images/compass/connect-to-host.png
      :figwidth: 626px

    .. tip::

       Starting with version 1.8.0, MongoDB Compass can detect
       whether you have a MongoDB
       :manual:`URI connection string </reference/connection-string>`
       in your system clipboard and auto-populate the connection
       dialog from the URI. Open MongoDB Compass with a URI
       connection string in your clipboard and click :guilabel:`Yes`
       when prompted to auto-populate the dialog.

       |compass| securely stores sensitive information entered in the
       connection form using an operating system-specific credentials API.
       For more information on how |compass-short| handles sensitive data,
       refer to the :ref:`FAQ page <compass-faq-confidential-data>`.
