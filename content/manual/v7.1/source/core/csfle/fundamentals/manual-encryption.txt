Overview
--------

Learn how to use the **{+manual-enc+}** mechanism of {+csfle+}
({+csfle-abbrev+}).

.. include:: /includes/fact-manual-enc-definition.rst

{+manual-enc-first+} is available in the following MongoDB products
of version 4.2 or later:

- MongoDB Community Server
- MongoDB Enterprise Advanced
- MongoDB Atlas

Use {+manual-enc-title+}
-----------------------

To use {+manual-enc+} you must perform the following actions in your
{+csfle-abbrev+}-enabled application:

- :ref:`csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption-client-enc`
- :ref:`csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption-update-operations`
- :ref:`Manually <csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption-manual-decryption>`
  or
  :ref:`Automatically <csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption-automatic-decryption>`
  Decrypt Fields in Your Documents

.. _csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption-client-enc:

Create a ClientEncryption Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use {+manual-enc+}, you must create a ``ClientEncryption``
instance. ``ClientEncryption`` is an abstraction used across drivers and
:binary:`~bin.mongosh` that encapsulates the {+key-vault-long+}
and {+kms-abbr+} operations involved in {+manual-enc+}.

To create a ``ClientEncryption`` instance, you must specify
the following information:

- A ``MongoClient`` instance with access to your {+key-vault-long+}
- The namespace of your {+key-vault-long+}
- A ``kmsProviders`` object configured with access to the
  {+kms-abbr+} provider hosting your {+cmk-long+}

For more ``ClientEncryption`` options, see :ref:`csfle-reference-mongo-client`. 

To view code snippets that show how to create a ``ClientEncryption``
instance, see the :ref:`csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption-example`
section of this guide.

.. _csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption-update-operations:

Encrypt Fields in Read and Write Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must update read and write operations throughout your application
such that your application encrypts fields before performing
read and write operations.

To encrypt fields, use the ``encrypt`` method of your ``ClientEncryption``
instance.

To view code snippets that show how to use the ``encrypt`` method,
see the :ref:`csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption-example`
section of this guide.

.. _csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption-manual-decryption:

Manual Decryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can decrypt your encrypted fields manually or automatically when
using {+manual-enc+}.

To decrypt your fields manually, use the ``decrypt`` method of your
``ClientEncryption`` instance.

To view code snippets that show how to use the ``decrypt`` method,
see the :ref:`csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption-example`
section of this guide.

.. _csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption-automatic-decryption:

Automatic Decryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To decrypt your fields automatically, configure your
``MongoClient`` instance as follows:

- Specify your {+key-vault-long+}
- Specify a ``kmsProviders`` object
- If you use MongoDB Community Server, set the ``bypassAutoEncryption``
  option to ``True``


.. note:: Automatic Decryption is Available in MongoDB Community Server

   Although automatic encryption requires MongoDB Enterprise or MongoDB
   Atlas, automatic decryption is available in the following MongoDB
   products of version 4.2 or later:

   - MongoDB Community Server
   - MongoDB Enterprise Advanced
   - MongoDB Atlas

Example

Assume you want to insert documents with the following structure into
your MongoDB instance:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/manual-encryption/sample.json
   :language: json

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Create a MongoClient Instance

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/manual-encryption/example/client.rst

   .. step:: Create a ClientEncryption Instance

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/manual-encryption/example/clientEnc.rst

   .. step:: Encrypt Fields and Insert

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/manual-encryption/example/encFields.rst

   .. step:: Retrieve Document and Decrypt Fields

      .. include:: /includes/fundamentals/manual-encryption/example/decFields.rst

.. _csfle-fundamentals-manual-encryption-server-side-schema:

Server-Side Field Level Encryption Enforcement
----------------------------------------------

MongoDB supports using :ref:`schema validation
<schema-validation-overview>` to enforce encryption of specific fields
in a collection.

A client performing {+csfle+} with the {+manual-enc+}
mechanism on a MongoDB instance configured to enforce encryption
of certain fields must encrypt those fields as specified on
the MongoDB instance.

To learn how to set up server-side {+csfle-abbrev+}
enforcement, see :ref:`csfle-reference-server-side-schema`.
