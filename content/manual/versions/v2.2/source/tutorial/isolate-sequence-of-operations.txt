Overview
--------

Write operations are atomic on the level of a single document: no
single write operation can atomically affect more than one document or
more than one collection.

When a single write operation modifies multiple documents, the
operation as a whole is not atomic, and other operations may
interleave. The modification of a single document, or record, is always
atomic, even if the write operation modifies multiple sub-document
*within* the single record.

No other operations are atomic; however, you can *isolate* a
single write operation that affects multiple documents using the
:doc:`isolation operator </reference/operator/update/isolated>`.

This document describes one method of updating documents *only* if the
local copy of the document reflects the current state of the document
in the database. In addition the following methods provide a way to
manage isolated sequences of operations:

- the :method:`~db.collection.findAndModify()`
  provides an isolated query and modify operation.

- :doc:`/tutorial/perform-two-phase-commits`

- Create a :ref:`unique index <index-type-unique>`, to ensure that a
  key doesn't exist when you insert it.

Update if Current
-----------------

In this pattern, you will:

- query for a document,

- modify the fields in that document

- and update the fields of a document *only if* the fields have not
  changed in the collection since the query.

Consider the following example in JavaScript which attempts to update
the ``qty`` field of a document in the ``products`` collection:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :linenos:

   var myCollection = db.products;
   var myDocument = myCollection.findOne( { sku: 'abc123' } );

   if (myDocument) {

      var oldQty = myDocument.qty;

      if (myDocument.qty < 10) {
          myDocument.qty *= 4;
      } else if ( myDocument.qty < 20 ) {
          myDocument.qty *= 3;
      } else {
          myDocument.qty *= 2;
      }

      myCollection.update(
         {
           _id: myDocument._id,
           qty: oldQty
         },
         {
           $set: { qty: myDocument.qty }
         }
      )

      var err = db.getLastErrorObj();

      if ( err && err.code ) {
          print("unexpected error updating document: " + tojson( err ));
      } else if ( err.n == 0 ) {
          print("No update: no matching document for { _id: " + myDocument._id + ", qty: " + oldQty + " }")
      }

   }

Your application may require some modifications of this pattern, such
as:

- Use the entire document as the query in lines 18 and 19, to
  generalize the operation and guarantee that the original document
  was not modified, rather than ensuring that as single field was not
  changed.

- Add a version variable to the document that applications increment
  upon each update operation to the documents. Use this version
  variable in the query expression. You must be able to ensure that
  *all* clients that connect to your database obey this constraint.

- Use :update:`$set` in the update expression to modify only your
  fields and prevent overriding other fields.

- Use one of the methods described in :doc:`/tutorial/create-an-auto-incrementing-field`.

.. Maybe incorporate the blurb: "MongoDB does not
   support traditional locking and complex transactions for a number of
   reasons: First, in sharded environments, distributed locks could be
   expensive and slow. MongoDB's goal is to be lightweight and fast. We
   dislike the concept of deadlocks. We want the system to be simple and
   predictable without these sort of surprises. We want Mongo DB to work
   well for realtime problems. If an operation may execute which locks
   large amounts of data, it might stop some small light queries for an
   extended period of time."
