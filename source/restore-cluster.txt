Restore a Cluster
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


|service| lets you restore data from a scheduled snapshot or from a
selected point between snapshots. For replica sets, you can restore
from selected points in time. For sharded clusters you can restore from
checkpoints between snapshots. For information on backup,
:doc:`/backup-cluster`.

Restore a Cluster
-----------------

To restore a cluster, go to :guilabel:`Backup` view. In the
:guilabel:`Overview`, hover over the :guilabel:`Status` field of the
cluster backup to display the :guilabel:`Restore` button. Click the
:guilabel:`Restore` button or click the ellipsis button under
:guilabel:`Options` and select :guilabel:`Restore`.

Follow the prompts to restore your cluster. You may choose to:

- Download your backup data via HTTPS and restore manually.

  \- or - 

- Have |service| restore to a selected cluster. |service| can only
  restore to a cluster of the same type (i.e. replica set to replica
  set or sharded cluster to sharded cluster) within the group. The
  restore process requires **downtime** for the target cluster.
