   :description: Learn how to monitor events by using the {+driver-long+}.

Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to set up and configure **monitoring** in the
{+driver-long+}.

Monitoring involves collecting information about the activities of a running
program, which you can use with an application performance management
library.

Monitoring the {+driver-short+} lets you understand the driver's resource usage
and performance,  and can help you make informed decisions when designing and
debugging your application.

In this guide you will learn how to perform these tasks:

- :ref:`Monitor Command Events <node-command-monitoring>`
- :ref:`Monitor Server Discovery and Monitoring (SDAM) Events <node-cluster-monitoring>`
- :ref:`Monitor Connection Pool Events <node-connection-pool-monitoring>`

This guide shows how to use information about the activity of the driver in code.
To learn how to record events in the driver, see the {+driver-short+}'s 
:ref:`Logging <node-logging>` guide. 

.. _node-monitoring-events:

Monitor Events
--------------

You can monitor events using the {+driver-short+} by subscribing to them in your
application.

An event is any action that occurs within the driver during its operation. The
{+driver-short+} includes functionality for listening to a subset of these
events.

The {+driver-short+} organizes the events it defines into the following categories:

- Command Events
- Server Discovery and Monitoring (SDAM) Events
- Connection Pool Events

The following sections show how to monitor each event category.

.. _node-command-monitoring:

Command Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A command event is an event related to a MongoDB database command. You can
access one or more command monitoring events using the driver by subscribing to
them in your application.

To learn more about MongoDB database commands, see the
:manual:`Database Commands </reference/command/>` guide in the Server Manual.

.. note::

   Command monitoring is disabled by default. To enable command
   monitoring, pass the ``monitorCommands`` option as ``true`` to
   your ``MongoClient`` constructor. 

Example
```````

The following example demonstrates connecting to a replica set and subscribing
to one of the command monitoring events created by the MongoDB deployment:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/monitoring/apm-subscribe.js
   :language: javascript

Event Descriptions
``````````````````

You can subscribe to any of the following command monitoring events:

.. list-table::

   * - Event Name
     - Description

   * - ``commandStarted``
     - Created when a command is started.

   * - ``commandSucceeded``
     - Created when a command succeeded.

   * - ``commandFailed``
     - Created when a command failed.

.. _node-cluster-monitoring:

Server Discovery and Monitoring Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+driver-short+} creates topology events, also known as SDAM events, when
there is a change in the state of the instance or cluster that you connected to.
For example, the driver creates an event when you establish a new connection or
if the cluster elects a new primary node.

To learn more about topology events, see the :manual:`Replication </replication>` guide in the Server Manual.

The following sections demonstrate how to record topology changes in your application
and explore the information provided in these events.

Event Subscription Example
``````````````````````````

You can access one or more SDAM events by subscribing to them
in your application. The following example demonstrates connecting to a
replica set and subscribing to one of the SDAM events created by the MongoDB
deployment:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/monitoring/sdam-subscribe.js
   :language: javascript

Event Descriptions
``````````````````

You can subscribe to any of the following SDAM events:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 67 
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Event Name
     - Description

   * - ``serverOpening``
     - Created when a connection to an instance opens.

   * - ``serverClosed``
     - Created when a connection to an instance closes.

   * - ``serverDescriptionChanged``
     - Created when an instance state changes (such as from secondary to
       primary).

   * - ``topologyOpening``
     - Created before attempting a connection to an instance.

   * - ``topologyClosed``
     - Created after all instance connections in the topology close.

   * - ``topologyDescriptionChanged``
     - Created when the topology changes, such as an election of a new
       primary or a **mongos** proxy disconnecting.

   * - ``serverHeartbeatStarted``
     - Created before issuing a ``hello`` command to a MongoDB instance.

   * - ``serverHeartbeatSucceeded``
     - Created when the ``hello`` command returns successfully from a
       MongoDB instance.

   * - ``serverHeartbeatFailed``
     - Created when a ``hello`` command issued to a specific MongoDB
       instance fails to return a successful response.

The following sections show sample output for each type of SDAM event.

Connection Pool Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A connection pool is a set of open TCP connections your driver maintains with a
MongoDB instance. Connection pools help reduce the number of network handshakes
your application needs to perform and can help your application run faster.

The following sections demonstrate how to record connection pool events in your
application and explore the information provided in these events.

Event Subscription Examples
```````````````````````````

You can access one or more connection pool events using the driver by
subscribing to them in your application. The following example demonstrates
connecting to a replica set and subscribing to one of the connection
pool monitoring events created by the MongoDB deployment:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/monitoring/cpm-subscribe.js
   :language: javascript

Connection pool monitoring events can aid you in debugging and understanding
the behavior of your application's connection pool. The following example uses connection
pool monitoring events to return a count of checked-out connections in the pool:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/monitoring/cpm-status.js
   :language: javascript

Event Descriptions
``````````````````

You can subscribe to any of the following connection pool monitoring events:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 67
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Event Name
     - Description

   * - ``connectionPoolCreated``
     - Created when a connection pool is created.

   * - ``connectionPoolReady``
     - Created when a connection pool is ready.

   * - ``connectionPoolClosed``
     - Created when a connection pool is closed before server
       instance destruction.

   * - ``connectionCreated``
     - Created when a connection is created, but not necessarily
       when it is used for an operation.

   * - ``connectionReady``
     - Created after a connection has successfully completed a
       handshake and is ready to be used for operations.

   * - ``connectionClosed``
     - Created when a connection is closed.

   * - ``connectionCheckOutStarted``
     - Created when an operation attempts to acquire a connection for
       execution.

   * - ``connectionCheckOutFailed``
     - Created when an operation fails to acquire a connection for
       execution.

   * - ``connectionCheckedOut``
     - Created when an operation successfully acquires a connection for
       execution.

   * - ``connectionCheckedIn``
     - Created when a connection is checked back into the pool after an operation
       is executed.

   * - ``connectionPoolCleared``
     - Created when all connections are closed and the connection pool is
       cleared.
