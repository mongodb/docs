The shard key is either a single indexed :term:`field` or multiple
fields covered by a :term:`compound index` that determines the
distribution of the collection's :term:`documents <document>` among the
cluster's :term:`shards <shard>`.

MongoDB divides the span of shard key values (or hashed
shard key values) into non-overlapping ranges of shard key values (or
hashed shard key values). Each range is associated with a
:term:`chunk`, and MongoDB attempts to distribute chunks evenly among
the shards in the cluster.

.. include:: /images/sharding-range-based.rst

The shard key has a direct relationship to the effectiveness of chunk
distribution. See :ref:`sharding-shard-key-selection`.

Shard Key Indexes
-----------------

All sharded collections **must** have an index that supports the
:term:`shard key`. The index can be an index on the shard key or a
:term:`compound index` where the shard key is a :ref:`prefix
<compound-index-prefix>` of the index.

- If the collection is empty, :method:`sh.shardCollection()` creates
  the index on the shard key if such an index does not already exists.

- If the collection is not empty, you must create the index first
  before using :method:`sh.shardCollection()`.

If you drop the last valid index for the shard key, recover by
recreating an index on just the shard key.

.. _sharding-shard-key-unique:

Unique Indexes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB can enforce a uniqueness constraint on a ranged shard key index.
Through the use of a unique index on the shard key, MongoDB enforces
uniqueness on the entire key combination and not individual components
of the shard key.

For a ranged sharded collection, only the following indexes can be
:doc:`unique </core/index-unique>`:

- the index on the shard key

- a :term:`compound index` where the shard key is a :ref:`prefix
  <compound-index-prefix>`

- the default ``_id`` index; **however**, the ``_id`` index only
  enforces the uniqueness constraint per shard **if** the ``_id`` field
  is **not** the shard key or the prefix of the shard key.

  .. important:: Uniqueness and the ``_id`` Index

     If the ``_id`` field is not the shard key or the prefix of the
     shard key, ``_id`` index only enforces the uniqueness constraint
     per shard and **not** across shards.

     For example, consider a sharded collection (with shard key ``{x:
     1}``) that spans two shards A and B. Because the ``_id`` key is
     not part of the shard key, the collection could have a document
     with ``_id`` value ``1`` in shard A and another document with
     ``_id`` value ``1`` in shard B.

     If the ``_id`` field is not the shard key nor the prefix of the
     shard key, MongoDB expects applications to enforce the uniqueness
     of the ``_id`` values across the shards.

The unique index constraints mean that:

- For a to-be-sharded collection, you cannot shard the collection if
  the collection has other unique indexes.

- For an already-sharded collection, you cannot create unique indexes
  on other fields.

- A unique index stores a null value for a document missing the
  indexed field; that is a missing index field is treated as another
  instance of a ``null`` index key value. For more information, see
  :ref:`unique-index-and-missing-field`.

To enforce uniqueness on the shard key values, pass the ``unique``
parameter as ``true`` to the :method:`sh.shardCollection()` method:

.. include:: /includes/extracts/shard-collection-unique-restriction-method.rst

You cannot specify a unique constraint on a :ref:`hashed index
<index-type-hashed>`.

.. _shard-key-missing:

Missing Shard Key Fields
------------------------

Starting in version 4.4, documents in sharded collections can be
missing the shard key fields. To set missing shard key fields, see
:ref:`shard-key-missing-set`.

Chunk Range and Missing Shard Key Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Missing shard key fields fall within the same chunk range as shard keys
with null values. For example, if the shard key is on the fields ``{ x:
1, y: 1 }``, then:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 60 60

   * - Document Missing Shard Key

     - Falls into Same Range As

   * - ``{ x: "hello" }``
     - ``{ x: "hello", y: null }``

   * - ``{ y: "goodbye" }``
     - ``{ x: null, y: "goodbye" }``

   * - ``{ z: "oops" }``
     - ``{ x: null, y: null }``

.. _shard-key-missing-read-write-ops:

Read/Write Operations and Missing Shard Key Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To target documents with missing shard key fields, you can use the
:query:`{ $exists: false } <$exists>` filter condition on the shard key
fields. For example, if the shard key is on the fields ``{ x: 1, y: 1
}``, you can find the documents with missing shard key fields by running
this query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.shardedcollection.find( { $or: [ { x: { $exists: false } }, { y: { $exists: false } } ] } )

If you specify a :doc:`null equality match
</tutorial/query-for-null-fields>` filter condition (e.g. ``{ x: null
}``), the filter matches :red:`both` those documents with missing shard
key fields :red:`and` those with shard key fields set to ``null``.

Some write operations, such as a write with an ``upsert``
specification, require an equality match on the shard key. In those
cases, to target a document that is missing the shard key, include
another filter condition in addition to the ``null`` equality match.
For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { _id: <value>, <shardkeyfield>: null } // _id of the document missing shard key
