   :description: Explore third-party integrations and tools that work with the MongoDB Rust Driver, such as web frameworks Rocket and Actix, and discover related tutorials.

Overview
--------

This page describes some popular third-party integrations for working with the 
{+driver-long+}.

Frameworks
----------

This section lists web frameworks that you can use with the {+driver-short+}. To
learn how to integrate the following frameworks into the {+driver-short+}, see
the :github:`MongoDB Rust Frameworks Example repository
<mongodb-developer/mongodb-rust-web-frameworks-example>` on
GitHub.

Actix
~~~~~

`Actix Web <https://actix.rs/>`__ is a powerful and performant web framework for
building Rust applications with MongoDB. It provides an actor-based architecture
and supports both synchronous and asynchronous request handlers. You can find a
working example of how to use MongoDB with Actix in the ``databases`` directory
of the :github:`Actix GitHub repository
<actix/examples/tree/main/databases/mongodb>`.

For more information, see the `Actix Web documentation <https://actix.rs/docs/>`__.

.. TODO: Add link to Actix quickstart tutorial when available.

Rocket
~~~~~~

`Rocket <https://rocket.rs/>`__ is a web framework for Rust that enables you to write fast,
type-safe, secure web applications that use minimal boilerplate code.

To learn how to get started with MongoDB and Rocket, see the `Integrate MongoDB
with Rocket <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/rust-frameworks/rocket/>`__
guide.

To learn how to perform CRUD operations by using Rocket and the
{+driver-short+}, see the :ref:`Rocket CRUD Tutorial
<rust-rocket-web-app-tutorial>`.

Axum
~~~~

`Axum <https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum>`__ is a web application framework that focuses on
ergonomics and modularity. Built on top of Tokio, Tower, and Hyper, Axum provides a powerful
and simple API for building web services.

For more information, see the `Axum documentation <https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/>`__.

Tide
~~~~

`Tide <https://github.com/http-rs/tide>`__ is a minimal and pragmatic Rust web application
framework built for rapid development. It comes with a robust set of features to help you
build asynchronous web applications and APIs.

For more information, see the `Tide documentation <https://docs.rs/tide/latest/tide/>`__.

Warp
~~~~

`Warp <https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp>`__ is a composable web framework for
Rust. It provides a filter-based approach to building web services with a focus on performance.

For more information, see the `Warp documentation <https://docs.rs/warp/latest/warp/>`__.
