The :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell is included as part of the :doc:`MongoDB Server
</installation>` installation. MongoDB also provides the :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell as a standalone package. To download the standalone :binary:`~bin.mongo`
shell package:

1. Open the `Download Center 
   <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community?jmp=docs>`__. For the
   :binary:`~bin.mongo` Enterprise Shell, select the
   :guilabel:`MongoDB Enterprise Server` tab.
   
2. Select your preferred :guilabel:`Version` and :guilabel:`OS` from the 
   dropdowns.

3. Select ``Shell`` from the :guilabel:`Package` dropdown and click 
   :guilabel:`Download` to start downloading the package.

   If the ``Shell`` option is unavailable for the selected :guilabel:`OS` and
   :guilabel:`Version`, contact MongoDB :ref:`technical-support` for assistance.
