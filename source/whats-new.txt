      section of the Enterprise Authentication Mechanisms guide

.. _kotlin-sync-version-5.3:

What's New in 5.3
-----------------

The 5.3 driver release includes the following new features,
improvements, and fixes:

.. sharedinclude:: dbx/jvm/v5.3-wn-items.rst

   .. replacement:: vector-type-example-link

      To learn about this type, see the
      `BinaryVector <{+java-api+}/apidocs/bson/org/bson/BinaryVector.html>`__
      API documentation.

   .. replacement:: update-replace-example-link

      the :ref:`kotlin-sync-write-update`,
      :ref:`kotlin-sync-write-replace`, and
      :ref:`kotlin-sync-bulk-write` guides

- Support for using builders class methods directly with data class
  properties. To learn more, see the :ref:`kotlin-sync-builders-data-classes`
  guide. This functionality is supported by the `{+driver-short+}
  Extensions package <{+java-api+}/apidocs/mongodb-driver-kotlin-extensions/index.html>`__
  published with this release.

- Implements a *client* bulk write API that allows you to perform write
  operations on multiple databases and collections in the same call. To learn
  more about this feature, see the :ref:`kotlin-sync-client-bulk-write`
  section of the Bulk Write Operations guide.

.. _kotlin-sync-version-5.2:

What's New in 5.2
-----------------

.. important:: Removal of Support for {+mdb-server+} 3.6

   {+driver-short+} v5.2 removes support for {+mdb-server+} 3.6. To
   learn more about compatible versions of the server, see
   :ref:`kotlin-sync-compatibility`.

The 5.2 driver release includes the following new features,
improvements, and fixes:

.. sharedinclude:: dbx/jvm/v5.2-wn-items.rst

   .. replacement:: avs-index-link

      the :ref:`kotlin-sync-search-avs-indexes` guide

   .. replacement:: vector-search-link

      the :atlas:`Atlas Vector Search Quick Start
      </atlas-vector-search/tutorials/vector-search-quick-start/>` and
      select :guilabel:`Kotlin (Sync)` from the language dropdown

- Adds support for serializers from the ``kotlinx-datetime`` library
  that let you map {+language+} date and time types to BSON as the
  expected types instead of as strings. To learn more, see the
  :ref:`kotlin-sync-datetime-serialization` section of the {+language+}
  Serialization guide.

- Supports serialization of `JsonElement
  <{+kotlin-docs+}/api/kotlinx.serialization/kotlinx-serialization-json/kotlinx.serialization.json/-json-element/>`__
  values. To work with the ``JsonElement`` type, you must add the
  ``kotlinx-serialization-json`` library as a dependency in your
  application.

.. _kotlin-sync-version-5.1.3:

What's New in 5.1.3
-------------------

The 5.1.3 driver patch release includes the following changes:

.. sharedinclude:: dbx/jvm/v5.1.3-wn-items.rst

.. _kotlin-sync-version-5.1.2:

What's New in 5.1.2
-------------------

The 5.1.2 driver patch release includes the following changes:

- Support for encoding Kotlin data classes with nullable
  generic parameter types. For example, you can encode the ``Container`` class
  in the following code:
  
  .. code-block:: kotlin

     @Serializable
     data class Box<T>(
         val boxed: T
     )
     
     @Serializable
     data class Container(
         val box: Box<String?>
     )

.. _kotlin-sync-version-5.1.1:

What's New in 5.1.1
-------------------

The 5.1.1 driver patch release includes the following changes:

- When using the ``MONGODB-OIDC`` authentication mechanism, you must not
  include comma characters in the ``authMechanismProperties`` connection
  string value. 
  
.. TODO: Link to OIDC content once completed
.. ex. To learn more about this behavior, see the
  :ref:`MONGODB-OIDC <kotlin-sync-oidc>` section of the Enterprise
  Authentication guide.

.. _kotlin-sync-version-5.1:

What's New in 5.1
-----------------

.. warning:: Deprecations in this release

   To avoid breaking changes in future major releases of the driver,
   replace any application code that depends on deprecated program elements.

This section includes the following information:

- :ref:`kotlin-sync-deprecations-5.1`
- :ref:`kotlin-sync-improvements-5.1`
- :ref:`kotlin-sync-new-features-5.1`

.. _kotlin-sync-deprecations-5.1:

Deprecations in 5.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support for {+mdb-server+} v3.6 is deprecated and will be removed in the
  next driver version release. To learn how to upgrade your {+mdb-server+}
  deployment, see :manual:`Release Notes </release-notes>` in the {+mdb-server+}
  manual.

.. _kotlin-sync-improvements-5.1:

Improvements in 5.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Internal testing of GraalVM native image technology. These tests involve building
  native applications by using the GraalVM native-image tool.

- Enhanced support for the ``MONGODB-OIDC`` authentication mechanism.

.. TODO: Link to OIDC content once completed
.. ex. To learn more about OIDC, see the
  :ref:`MONGODB-OIDC <kotlin-sync-oidc>` section of the Enterprise
  Authentication guide.

- Fixes an issue in which operations used the incorrect codec when using
  a polymorphic ``MongoCollection`` instance. This ensures that
  discriminator information is not lost when using ``bson-kotlinx``.

- Fixes an issue in which the class discriminator was the first field
  when decoding, resulting in field type errors when using a polymorphic
  ``MongoCollection`` instance.

.. _kotlin-sync-new-features-5.1:

New Features in 5.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support for polymorphic serialization. To learn more, see the
  :ref:`kotlin-sync-polymorphic` section of the {+language+}
  Serialization guide.

- Introduces the ``serverMonitoringMode`` connection URI option. To
  learn more, see the :ref:`kotlin-sync-connection-options` guide.

.. _kotlin-sync-version-5.0:

What's New in 5.0
-----------------

New features of the 5.0 driver release include:

- The ``KotlinSerializerCodecProvider`` constructor now accepts
  ``serializersModule`` and ``bsonConfiguration`` objects:

  .. code-block:: kotlin
     
     KotlinSerializerCodec.create(clazz.kotlin, serializersModule=serializersModule, bsonConfiguration=bsonConfiguration)
  
  This makes it easier to customize your configuration.

- Fixes a Kotlin reflection bug that resulted in container type erasure.
