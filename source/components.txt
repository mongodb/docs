.. versionchanged:: 2.0
   Version 2.0 of the |bi| introduces a new architecture that replaces
   the previous PostgreSQL foreign data wrapper with the new
   :binary:`~bin.mongosqld`.

   As a result, the |bi| no longer requires ``mongobiuser`` and
   ``mongobischema``.

   .. include:: /includes/fact-upgrade.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-bi-enterprise.rst

The following tools are available for use with the |bi|:

- :binary:`~bin.mongodrdl` generates database schema information for use
  with the |bi|.
- :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` proxies incoming queries between SQL clients
  and a MongoDB server.
- :binary:`~bin.mongotranslate` translates a given SQL query into a
  MongoDB :manual:`aggregation pipeline </aggregation>`.
- The :ref:`MongoDB ODBC driver <odbc-driver>` provides connectivity
  between SQL clients and the |bi|.
- The :ref:`C Authentication Plugin <install-auth-c-plugin>` and
  :ref:`JDBC Authentication Plugin <install-auth-jdbc-plugin>`
  facilitate secure transmission of authentication credentials between
  :binary:`~bin.mongosqld` and a MySQL client.
