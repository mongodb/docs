"Ranged-based sharding involves dividing data into contiguous ranges "
"determined by the shard key values. In this model, documents with "
"\"close\" shard key values are likely to be in the same :term:`chunk` or "
":term:`shard`. This allows for efficient queries where reads target "
"documents within a contiguous range. However, both read and write "
"performance may decrease with poor shard key selection. See :ref"
":`sharding-ranged-shard-key`."
