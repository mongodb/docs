What is the Difference Between the {+csharp-driver-short+} and the {+provider-short+}?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :driver:`{+csharp-driver-long+} </csharp>` is a library that exposes MongoDB functionality
directly and includes a LINQ provider with projections, group
operations, and flexible mapping. The driver includes features such as the
following:

- Transactions
- Bulk operations
- LINQ queries
- Operations that directly modify the database
- Aggregation operations
- Custom mapping

The {+provider-long+} allows you to use Microsoft's {+framework-core+} with
MongoDB in your {+dotnet-csharp+} applications. The {+provider-short+} supports
change tracking, entity-based LINQ operations, and modeling familiar to
{+framework-core+} users. The provider includes features such as the following:

- Intelligent object tracking
- Entity-based LINQ operations
- Entity Framework modeling and mapping with the fluent API
- Automatic database updates through change tracking
