Your |fts| index is named ``default`` by default. If you keep this name, then your index will be the 
default Search index for any |fts| query that does not specify a different ``index`` option in 
its :ref:`operators <fts-operators>`. If you are creating multiple indexes, we recommend 
that you maintain a consistent, descriptive naming convention across your indexes.
