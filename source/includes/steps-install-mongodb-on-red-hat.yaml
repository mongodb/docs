title: Configure the package management system (``yum``).
stepnum: 1
ref: config-yum
pre: |
  Create a ``/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-{+version+}.repo`` file so that
  you can install MongoDB directly using ``yum``:

action:
  language: cfg
  code: |
    [mongodb-org-{+version+}]
    name=MongoDB Repository
    baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/{{distro_name}}/{{distro_release}}/mongodb-org/{+package-branch+}/x86_64/
    gpgcheck=1
    enabled=1
    gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-{+pgp-version+}.asc
post: |
  .. note::

     You can find ``.repo`` files for each release {{distro_link}}.
     Odd-numbered minor release versions (e.g. 3.5) are development
     versions and are unsuitable for production use.
replacement:
  distro_name: "redhat"
  distro_link: "`in the repository itself <https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/>`_"
  distro_release: "$releasever"

title: Install the MongoDB packages.
stepnum: 2
ref: install
# pre: |
#   When you install the packages, you choose whether to install the current
#   release or a previous one. This step provides the commands for both.
action:
  - pre: |
      To install the latest stable version of MongoDB, issue the following
      command:
    language: sh
    code: |
      sudo yum install -y {+package-name-org+}
  - pre: |
      To install a specific release of MongoDB, specify each
      component package individually and append the version number to the
      package name, as in the following example:

      .. include:: /includes/release/pin-repo-to-version-yum.rst
  - pre: |
      You can specify any available version of MongoDB. However ``yum``
      upgrades the packages when a newer version becomes available. To
      prevent unintended upgrades, pin the package. To pin a package, add
      the following ``exclude`` directive to your ``/etc/yum.conf`` file:
    language: ini
    code: |
      exclude=mongodb-org,mongodb-org-server,mongodb-org-shell,mongodb-org-mongos,mongodb-org-tools
...
