$elemMatch (projection)
=======================

.. seealso:: :doc:`/reference/operator/elemMatch`

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. projection:: $elemMatch

   .. versionadded:: 2.2

   Use the :projection:`$elemMatch` projection operator to limit the
   response of a query to a single matching element of an
   array. Consider the following:

   .. example::

      Given the following document fragment:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         {
          _id: ObjectId(),
          zipcode: 63109,
          dependents: [
                       { name: "john", school: 102, age: 10 },
                       { name: "jess", school: 102, age: 11 },
                       { name: "jeff", school: 108, age: 15 }
                      ]
         }

      Consider the following :method:`find() <db.collection.find()>`
      operation:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         var projection = { _id: 0, dependents: { $elemMatch: { school: 102 }}};
         db.students.find( { zipcode: 63109 }, projection);

      The query would return all documents where the value of the
      ``zipcode`` field is ``63109``, while the projection excludes
      the ``_id`` field and only includes the first matching element of
      the ``dependents`` array where the ``school`` element has a value of
      ``102``. The documents would take the following form:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         {
          dependents: [
                       { name: "john", school: 102, age: 10 }
                      ]
         }

.. note::

   The :projection:`$elemMatch` projection will only match one array
   element per source document.
