Encrypted Backup Snapshots

Snapshot encryption depends upon which
:manual:`version of MongoDB your database is compatible </reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion>`.
This Feature Compatibility Version ranges from the current version
to one version earlier. For MongoDB 4.2, the FCV can be ``4.0`` or
``4.2``. You can only create encrypted snapshots from encrypted 
clusters.

      |mms| can encrypt any backup job that it had stored in a
      snapshot store. The snapshot must come from a database that
      ran
      :product:`MongoDB Enterprise <mongodb-enterprise-advanced>`
      4.2 or later with:

      - |fcv-link| of 4.2 or later and
      - :ref:`WiredTiger <encrypted-storage-engine>` storage engine.

      .. note::

         .. include:: /includes/facts/fcv-backup-considerations.rst

      To encrypt backups, use a master key that a |kmip|-compliant
      key management appliance generates and maintains. This master
      key encrypts key that encrypts the database.

      .. important::

         The :opsmgr:`Backup Daemon </reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-daemon>` requires a connection to the
         |kmip| host to process a :doc:`queryable restore job
         </tutorial/query-backup>` of an encrypted backup.

      |mms| supports encryption for any backup job that was
      stored in a :opsmgr:`head database </reference/glossary/#std-term-head-database>` running
      :product:`MongoDB Enterprise <mongodb-enterprise-advanced>`
      3.4 or later with the
      :ref:`WiredTiger <encrypted-storage-engine>` storage engine.

      To encrypt backups, you use a master key that a
      |kmip|-compliant key management appliance generates and
      maintains. This master key encrypts the
      :opsmgr:`head databases </reference/glossary/#std-term-head-database>`. As the
      :opsmgr:`Backup Daemon </reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-daemon>` creates snapshots from the head
      databases, resulting snapshots from the encrypted head
      databases are themselves encrypted.

      To restore from an encrypted backup, you need the same master
      key used to encrypt the backup and either the same certificate
      as is on the :opsmgr:`Backup Daemon </reference/glossary/#std-term-backup-daemon>` host or a new certificate
      provisioned with that key from the |kmip| host. This
      corresponds to the value in the **KMIP client certificate
      path** field.

Prerequisites
-------------

A host running |kmip|-compliant key management to generate and store
encryption keys.

      .. important::

         Clusters running MongoDB |fcv-link| 4.2 or later must use
         |kmip| servers. These clusters don't support local key
         management using files.

   .. tab:: FCV 4.0 or earlier
      :tabid: fcv40

      - :opsmgr:`Head databases </reference/glossary/#std-term-head-database>` use
        :product:`MongoDB Enterprise <mongodb-enterprise-advanced>`
        3.4 or later with the WiredTiger :manual:`storage engine </reference/glossary/#std-term-storage-engine>`.

      - A valid |kmip| client certificate and |kmip| host |certauth|
        files. These files are used to authenticate |onprem| to the
        |kmip| host. The client certificate on the Backup Daemon
        host must have access to all keys in the |kmip| host.

.. important::

   You must maintain all keys, even rotated keys, in the |kmip| host.

      .. important::

         For existing backups in a project, enabling encryption
         requires an initial backup sync to recreate the backups'
         head databases.
