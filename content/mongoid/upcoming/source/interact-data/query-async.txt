Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to perform asynchronous queries in
{+odm+}. You can run database queries asynchronously in the background,
which can be beneficial if your application retrieves documents from
multiple collections.

Run Async Queries
-----------------

To schedule an asynchronous query, call the ``load_async`` method on
a ``Criteria`` instance, as shown in the following code:

.. code-block:: ruby

   @active_bands = Band.where(active: true).load_async
   @public_articles = Article.where(public: true).load_async

The preceding code schedules the queries for asynchronous execution.
You can then access the results of the queries in your view as you
normally do for synchronous queries.

Even if you schedule a query for asynchronous execution, it might be
executed synchronously on the caller's thread. The following list
describes possible scenarios in which this situation might occur:

- If {+odm+} completes the scheduled asynchronous task, it returns
  the results.

- If {+odm+} starts but does not complete the task, the caller's
  thread blocks until {+odm+} finishes the task.

- If {+odm+} has not started a task yet, it is removed from the
  execution queue, and {+odm+} runs the query synchronously on the
  caller's thread.

.. note::

   Even though the ``load_async`` method returns a ``Criteria`` object,
   do not perform any operations on this object other than accessing query results.
   {+odm+} schedules the query for execution immediately after calling
   ``load_async``, so later changes to the ``Criteria`` object might not
   be applied.

Configure Query Performance
---------------------------

Asynchronous queries are disabled by default. When asynchronous queries
are disabled, the ``load_async`` method performs the query immediately
on the current thread, blocking as required. Therefore, calling
``load_async`` on a ``Criteria`` instance in this situation is similar
to calling the ``to_a`` method to force query execution.

To enable asynchronous query execution, you must set the following
configuration options:

.. code-block:: xml

   development:
     ...
     options:
       # Execute asynchronous queries using a global thread pool.
       async_query_executor: :global_thread_pool
       # Number of threads in the pool. The default is 4.
       # global_executor_concurrency: 4
