  Using either a package manager or a manual download, get the latest
  release in the |oldversion| series. If using a package manager, add a new
  repository for the |oldversion| binaries, then perform the actual downgrade
  process.

   Downgrade the shards one at a time. If the shards are replica sets, for each shard:

   a. Downgrade the :ref:`secondary <replica-set-secondary-members>`
      members of the replica set one at a time:

      i. :ref:`Perform a clean shut down <terminate-mongod-processes>`
         of the :binary:`~bin.mongod` process.

         .. include:: /includes/note-clean-shutdown.rst

      #. Replace the |newversion| binary with the |oldversion| binary.

      #. Start the |oldversion| binary with the ``--shardsvr`` and
         ``--port`` command line options. Include any other
         configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g.
         ``--bind_ip``.
 
         .. code-block:: sh

            mongod --shardsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path> \
              --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

         Or if using a :doc:`configuration file
         </reference/configuration-options>`, update the file to
         include :setting:`sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr
         <sharding.clusterRole>`, :setting:`net.port`, and any other
         configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g.
         :setting:`net.bindIp`, and start:

               dbpath: <path>


      #. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before
         downgrading the next secondary member. To check the member's
         state, you can issue :method:`rs.status()` in the
         :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell.

         Repeat for each secondary member.

   #. Step down the replica set primary.

      Connect a :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell to the primary and use
      :method:`rs.stepDown()` to step down the primary and force an
      election of a new primary:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         rs.stepDown()

   #. When :method:`rs.status()`
      shows that the primary has stepped down and another member
      has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, downgrade the stepped-down primary: 

      1. Shut down the stepped-down primary and replace the
         :binary:`~bin.mongod` binary with the |oldversion| binary.

      #. Start the |oldversion| binary with the ``--shardsvr`` and
         ``--port`` command line options. Include any other
         configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g.
         ``--bind_ip``.
 
         .. code-block:: sh

            mongod --shardsvr --port <port> --dbpath <path>  --bind_ip localhost,<hostname(s)|ip address(es)>

         Or if using a :doc:`configuration file
         </reference/configuration-options>`, update the file to
         include :setting:`sharding.clusterRole: shardsvr
         <sharding.clusterRole>`, :setting:`net.port`, and any other
         configuration as appropriate for your deployment, e.g.
         :setting:`net.bindIp`, and start the |oldversion| binary:
