        You can provide a Certificate Authority (CA) using the 
        {+atlas-ui+} by either:
    
        - Clicking :guilabel:`Upload` and selecting a ``.pem`` file from
          your filesystem and clicking :guilabel:`Save`.

        - Copying the contents of a ``.pem`` file into the provided text
          area and clicking :guilabel:`Save`.

        You can concatenate multiple CAs in the same ``.pem`` file or
        in the text area. Users can authenticate with certificates
        generated by any of the provided CAs.

        When you upload a CA, a project-level alert is
        automatically created to send a notification 30 days before
        the CA expires, repeating every 24 hours. You can view and
        edit this alert from |service|'s :guilabel:`Alert Settings` page. For more information on configuring alerts, see 
        :doc:`Configure Alert Settings </configure-alerts>`.
