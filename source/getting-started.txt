Introduction
------------

To get started with |service|, create your user account and create your first
group. If you are an existing |mms| user, you can use your current credentials
to create a |service| group. You can create multiple |service| groups.

Your group will host your MongoDB deployments and have an associated
payment method. You can give other |service| users access to your group,
allowing them to log into the group and manage your deployments.

After you create the group, |service| takes you to the :guilabel:`Clusters`
view to create your first MongoDB deployment. You will also create your first
MongoDB user, which will be an administrative user with global access to your
databases.

.. Outstanding Questions
.. _____________________

.. Can a user have multiple payment methods?

.. If a user has an existing Cloud Manager group with no hosts, can they
   convert that to an Atlas group? Is there a UI for that?

Follow the instructions on the UI screens to create your cluster
(either a replica set or a sharded cluster). For more information on
creating a cluster, see :doc:`/create-new-cluster`.

.. An account = a registered user.
.. An account != group.
.. Billing is at the group level, not the account level.
