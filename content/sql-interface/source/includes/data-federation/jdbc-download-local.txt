====================
System Requirements
====================

Hardware Requirements
-------------------------

The MongoDB |jdbc| driver has no hard system requirements. Any
system capable of running a modern SQL tool (such as Tableau) is capable of running the
MongoDB JDBC driver.

Software Requirements
-------------------------

The MongoDB JDBC driver is compatible with:

- Windows x86_64

- macOS x86_64 and macOS aarch64 architectures

- linux x86_64 and linux arm64 architectures

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenSSL 3.0 or greater is required for secure connections.

================
Installation
================

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Download the MongoDB |jdbc| Driver JAR file.

      Download the |jdbc| driver from the
      `MongoDB Download Center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/jdbc-driver>`__.

      .. note::

         The MongoDB |jdbc| driver is available in two JAR formats:

         - ``mongodb-jdbc-<version>-all.jar`` contains the driver and all 
           necessary dependencies. Required for Tableau and DBeaver.   
         - ``mongodb-jdbc-<version>.jar`` contains the driver without bundled 
           dependencies. Required for JetBrains tools.

   .. step:: Install and Configure the JDBC Driver.

      Copy the JAR file to the appropriate directory for your SQL tool. For example, to
      install the JDBC driver for Tableau on macOS, copy the file to
      ``~/Library/Tableau/Drivers``.

   For details on how to use the JDBC driver with your SQL tool, see the JDBC driver's `Read
