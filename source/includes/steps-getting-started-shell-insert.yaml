  In {+mongosh+}, run the following command:

  .. code-block:: none

     use gettingStarted

  This command creates a new :manual:`database
  </core/databases-and-collections/#databases>` called
  ``gettingStarted`` and points your {+mongosh+}
  environment to that database.

ref: shell-insert-document

  In {+mongosh+}, run the following command to insert
  a document into your new database:

  .. io-code-block:: 
     :copyable: true 

     .. input:: 
        :language: shell

        db.people.insertOne({
          name: { first: 'Alan', last: 'Turing' },
          birth: new Date('Jun 23, 1912'),
          death: new Date('Jun 07, 1954'),
          contribs: [ 'Turing machine', 'Turing test', 'Turingery' ],
          views : Long(1250000)
        })

     .. output::
        :language: json 

        {
          acknowledged: true,
          insertedId: ObjectId("5c9bca3c5345268c98ac7abc")
        }

  .. note::

     You might see a different value for
     :manual:`ObjectId </reference/bson-types/#objectid>`,
     because it is a system-generated value.

  This command creates a new :manual:`collection
  </core/databases-and-collections/#collections>` in your
  ``gettingStarted`` database called ``people`` and inserts one
  document into that collection.

  To view the data that you just inserted into your
  cluster, run the following command to search the 
  ``people`` collection for documents that have a 
  ``name.last`` value of ``Turing``:

  .. io-code-block:: 
     :copyable: true 

     .. input:: 
        :language: json

        db.people.find({ "name.last": "Turing" })
  
     .. output::
        :language: json 

        { 
          _id: ObjectId("5c9bca3c5345268c98ac7abc"),
          name: {
              first: 'Alan',
              last: 'Turing'
          },
          birth: ISODate("1912-06-23T04:00:00Z"),
