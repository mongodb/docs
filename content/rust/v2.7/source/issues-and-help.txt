Pull Requests
-------------

We are happy to accept contributions to help improve the
{+driver-short+}. We guide user contributions to ensure they meet
the standards of the codebase. Please ensure that any pull requests
include documentation and tests, and confirm that they pass the
integration and unit tests in the source code.

To get started, clone the {+driver-short+} repository and create a
feature branch with the following shell commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver.git
   $ cd mongo-rust-driver
   $ git checkout -b myNewFeature

After making any code changes, follow the `testing guidelines
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver#running-the-tests>`__ to
ensure your code passes any newly added and existing tests. Then, push
your changes to your branch and open a pull request in the
`{+driver-short+} repository <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-rust-driver>`__ on GitHub.
