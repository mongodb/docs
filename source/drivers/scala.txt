`Casbah <http://github.com/mongodb/casbah>`_ is the officially supported
Scala driver for MongoDB.
It provides wrappers and extensions to the
:doc:`Java Driver </drivers/java>`
meant to allow a more Scala-friendly interface to MongoDB.
It supports serialization/deserialization of common Scala types (including
collections and regex), Scala collection versions of DBObject and
DBList and a fluid query DSL.

- `frontlets <https://github.com/riedelcastro/frontlets>`_ lightweight
  typed wrappers around Scala maps, with strong mongo support and JSON
  integration. Supports type-safe queries in spirit of the original
  mongo collection interface, object graph traversal, immutable
  objects among other features.

- `Subset2 <https://github.com/osinka/subset2>`_ MongoDB document parser 
   combinators and builders for use with the Java driver.

- `Hammersmith <https://github.com/bwmcadams/hammersmith>`_ is a
  Scala-based, asynchronous Netty driver for MongoDB with type-class
  based fast custom object encoding.

- `Salat <https://github.com/novus/salat/>`_ is a simple serialization 
  library for case classes. Leverages MongoDB's DBObject 
  (which uses BSON underneath) as its target format. Salat is focused 
  on fostering a DWIM and intuitive usage pattern for the end-user's 
  benefit, without sacrificing run time performance.

- `Blue Eyes <http://github.com/jdegoes/blueeyes>`_ is a lightweight
  framework for building REST APIs with strong MongoDB integration
  including a DSL and Mock MongoDB for testing.

- `Lift Web Framework <http://liftweb.net/>`_ supports MongoDb through
  - `Lift-MongoDB <http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/MongoDB>`_
  and object mapping via the
  `Record <http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/Record>`_ back-end
  implementation.
