.. pipeline:: $lookup

   .. versionadded:: 3.2

   Performs a left outer join to an unsharded collection in the *same*
   database to filter in documents from the "joined" collection for
   processing. To each input document, the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage
   adds a new array field whose elements are the matching documents
   from the "joined" collection. The :pipeline:`$lookup` stage passes
   these reshaped documents to the next stage.

Syntax
------

The :pipeline:`$lookup` stage has the following syntaxes:

Equality Match
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform an equality match between a field from the input documents
with a field from the documents of the "joined" collection, the
:pipeline:`$lookup` stage has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: none

   {
      $lookup:
        {
          from: <collection to join>,
          localField: <field from the input documents>,
          foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
          as: <output array field>
        }
   }

The :pipeline:`$lookup` takes a document with the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``from``

     - Specifies the collection in the *same* database to perform
       the join with. The ``from`` collection cannot be sharded.

   * - ``localField``

     - Specifies the field from the documents input to the
       :pipeline:`$lookup` stage. :pipeline:`$lookup` performs an
       equality match on the ``localField`` to the
       ``foreignField`` from the documents of the ``from``
       collection. If an input document does not contain the
       ``localField``, the :pipeline:`$lookup` treats the
       field as having a value of ``null`` for matching purposes.

       .. note::

          If your ``localField`` is an array, you may want to add an
          :pipeline:`$unwind` stage to your pipeline. Otherwise, the
          equality condition between the ``localField`` and
          ``foreignField`` is ``foreignField: { $in: [
          localField.elem1, localField.elem2, ... ] }``.

          See the :ref:`example <unwind-example>` on this page.

   * - ``foreignField``

     - Specifies the field from the documents in the ``from``
       collection. :pipeline:`$lookup` performs an equality match on
       the ``foreignField`` to the ``localField`` from the input
       documents. If a document in the ``from`` collection does not
       contain the ``foreignField``, the :pipeline:`$lookup` treats
       the value as ``null`` for matching purposes.

   * - ``as``

     - Specifies the name of the new array field to add to the input
       documents. The new array field contains the matching
       documents from the ``from`` collection. If the specified name
       already exists in the input document, the existing field is
       *overwritten*.

The operation would correspond to the following pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT *, <output array field>
   FROM collection
   WHERE <output array field> IN (SELECT *
                                  FROM <collection to join>
                                  WHERE <foreignField>= <collection.localField>);

See the following examples:

- :ref:`lookup-single-equality`
- :ref:`unwind-example`
- :ref:`lookup-mergeObjects`

.. _lookup-syntax-let-pipeline:

Join Conditions and Uncorrelated Sub-queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.6

To perform uncorrelated subqueries between two collections as well as
allow other join conditions besides a single equality match, the
:pipeline:`$lookup` stage has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: none

   {
      $lookup:
        {
          from: <collection to join>,
          let: { <var_1>: <expression>, …, <var_n>: <expression> },
          pipeline: [ <pipeline to execute on the collection to join> ],
          as: <output array field>
        }
   }

The :pipeline:`$lookup` takes a document with the following fields:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - ``from``

     - Specifies the collection in the *same* database to perform
       the join with. The ``from`` collection cannot be sharded.

   * - ``let``

     - Optional. Specifies variables to use in the ``pipeline`` field stages. Use
       the variable expressions to access the fields from the documents
       input to the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage.

       The ``pipeline`` cannot directly access the input document
       fields. Instead, first define the variables for the input
       document fields, and then reference the variables in the stages
       in the ``pipeline``.

       To access the ``let`` variables in the ``pipeline``, use the
       ``$expr`` operator.

       .. note::

          The ``let`` variables are accessible by the stages in the
          ``pipeline``, including additional :pipeline:`$lookup` stages
          nested in the ``pipeline``.

   * - ``pipeline``

     - Specifies the pipeline to run on the joined collection. The
       ``pipeline`` determines the resulting documents from the joined
       collection. To return all documents, specify an empty pipeline
       ``[]``.

       The ``pipeline`` cannot directly access the input document
       fields. Instead, first define the variables for the input
       document fields, and then reference the variables in the stages
       in the ``pipeline``.

       .. note::

          You cannot access aggregation variables in the
          :pipeline:`$match` stage which uses the standard MongoDB
          query operators.

   * - ``as``

     - Specifies the name of the new array field to add to the input
       documents. The new array field contains the matching
       documents from the ``from`` collection. If the specified name
       already exists in the input document, the existing field is
       *overwritten*.

The operation would correspond to the following pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT *, <output array field>
   FROM collection
   WHERE <output array field> IN (SELECT <documents as determined from the pipeline>
                                  FROM <collection to join>
                                  WHERE <pipeline> );

.. _lookup-single-equality:

Perform a Single Equality Join with ``$lookup``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection ``orders`` contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

  { "_id" : 1, "item" : "abc", "price" : 12, "quantity" : 2 }
  { "_id" : 2, "item" : "jkl", "price" : 20, "quantity" : 1 }
  { "_id" : 3  }

Another collection ``inventory`` contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

  { "_id" : 1, "sku" : "abc", description: "product 1", "instock" : 120 }
  { "_id" : 2, "sku" : "def", description: "product 2", "instock" : 80 }
  { "_id" : 3, "sku" : "ijk", description: "product 3", "instock" : 60 }
  { "_id" : 4, "sku" : "jkl", description: "product 4", "instock" : 70 }
  { "_id" : 5, "sku": null, description: "Incomplete" }
  { "_id" : 6 }

The following aggregation operation on the ``orders`` collection
joins the documents from ``orders`` with the documents from the
``inventory`` collection using the fields ``item`` from the
``orders`` collection and the ``sku`` field from the ``inventory``
collection:

.. code-block:: javascript

  db.orders.aggregate([
      {
        $lookup:
          {
            from: "inventory",
            localField: "item",
            foreignField: "sku",
            as: "inventory_docs"
          }
     }
  ])

The operation returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "_id" : 1,
      "item" : "abc",
     "price" : 12,
     "quantity" : 2,
     "inventory_docs" : [
       { "_id" : 1, "sku" : "abc", description: "product 1", "instock" : 120 }
     ]
   }
   {
     "_id" : 2,
     "item" : "jkl",
     "price" : 20,
     "quantity" : 1,
     "inventory_docs" : [
       { "_id" : 4, "sku" : "jkl", "description" : "product 4", "instock" : 70 }
     ]
   }
   {
     "_id" : 3,
     "inventory_docs" : [
       { "_id" : 5, "sku" : null, "description" : "Incomplete" },
       { "_id" : 6 }
     ]
   }

The operation would correspond to the following pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT *, inventory_docs
   FROM orders
   WHERE inventory_docs IN (SELECT *
   FROM inventory
   WHERE sku= orders.item);

.. _unwind-example:

Use ``$lookup`` with an Array
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your ``localField`` is an array and you'd like to match the elements
inside it against a ``foreignField`` which is a single element, you'll
need to :pipeline:`$unwind` the array as one stage of the aggregation
pipeline.

Consider a collection ``orders`` with the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "item" : "MON1003", "price" : 350, "quantity" : 2, "specs" :
   [ "27 inch", "Retina display", "1920x1080" ], "type" : "Monitor" }

Another collection ``inventory`` contains the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "sku" : "MON1003", "type" : "Monitor", "instock" : 120,
   "size" : "27 inch", "resolution" : "1920x1080" }
   { "_id" : 2, "sku" : "MON1012", "type" : "Monitor", "instock" : 85,
   "size" : "23 inch", "resolution" : "1280x800" }
   { "_id" : 3, "sku" : "MON1031", "type" : "Monitor", "instock" : 60,
   "size" : "23 inch", "display_type" : "LED" }

The following aggregation operation performs a join on documents in the
``orders`` collection which match a particular element of the ``specs``
array to the ``size`` field in the ``inventory`` collection.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.aggregate([
      {
         $unwind: "$specs"
      },
      {
         $lookup:
            {
               from: "inventory",
               localField: "specs",
               foreignField: "size",
               as: "inventory_docs"
           }
      },
      {
         $match: { "inventory_docs": { $ne: [] } }
      }
   ])

The operation returns the following document:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      "_id" : 1,
      "item" : "MON1003",
      "price" : 350,
      "quantity" : 2,
      "specs" : "27 inch",
      "type" : "Monitor",
      "inventory_docs" : [
         {
            "_id" : 1,
            "sku" : "MON1003",
            "type" : "Monitor",
            "instock" : 120,
            "size" : "27 inch",
            "resolution" : "1920x1080"
         }
      ]
   }

.. _lookup-mergeObjects:

Use ``$lookup`` with ``$mergeObjects``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

   MongoDB 3.6 adds the :expression:`$mergeObjects` operator to combine
   multiple documents into a single document

Create a collection ``orders`` with the following documents:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.insert([
     { "_id" : 1, "item" : "abc", "price" : 12, "ordered" : 2 },
     { "_id" : 2, "item" : "jkl", "price" : 20, "ordered" : 1 }
   ])

Create another collection ``items`` with the following documents:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.items.insert([
     { "_id" : 1, "item" : "abc", description: "product 1", "instock" : 120 },
     { "_id" : 2, "item" : "def", description: "product 2", "instock" : 80 },
     { "_id" : 3, "item" : "jkl", description: "product 3", "instock" : 60 }
   ])

The following operation first uses the :pipeline:`$lookup` stage to
join the two collections by the ``item`` fields and then uses
:expression:`$mergeObjects` in the :pipeline:`$replaceRoot` to merge
the joined documents from ``items`` and ``orders``:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.aggregate([
      {
         $lookup: {
            from: "items",
            localField: "item",    // field in the orders collection
            foreignField: "item",  // field in the items collection
            as: "fromItems"
         }
      },
      {
         $replaceRoot: { newRoot: { $mergeObjects: [ { $arrayElemAt: [ "$fromItems", 0 ] }, "$$ROOT" ] } }
      },
      { $project: { fromItems: 0 } }
   ])

The operation returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "item" : "abc", "description" : "product 1", "instock" : 120, "price" : 12, "ordered" : 2 }
   { "_id" : 2, "item" : "jkl", "description" : "product 3", "instock" : 60, "price" : 20, "ordered" : 1 }

.. _lookup-multiple-joins:

Specify Multiple Join Conditions with ``$lookup``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

   MongoDB 3.6 adds support for executing a pipeline on the joined
   collection, which allows for specifying multiple join conditions as
   well as uncorrelated sub-queries.

Create a collection ``orders`` with the following documents:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.insert([
     { "_id" : 1, "item" : "abc", "price" : 12, "ordered" : 2 },
     { "_id" : 2, "item" : "jkl", "price" : 20, "ordered" : 1 },
     { "_id" : 3, "item" : "xyz", "price" : 10, "ordered" : 60 }
   ])

Create another collection ``warehouses`` with the following documents:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.warehouses.insert([
     { "_id" : 1, "stock_item" : "abc", warehouse: "A", "instock" : 120 },
     { "_id" : 2, "stock_item" : "jkl", warehouse: "A", "instock" : 80 },
     { "_id" : 3, "stock_item" : "abc", warehouse: "B", "instock" : 60 },
     { "_id" : 4, "stock_item" : "xyz", warehouse: "B", "instock" : 40 },
     { "_id" : 5, "stock_item" : "xyz", warehouse: "A", "instock" : 80 }
   ])

The following operation joins the ``orders`` collection with the
``warehouse`` collection by the item and whether the quantity in stock
is sufficient to cover the ordered quantity:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.orders.aggregate([
      {
         $lookup:
            {
              from: "warehouses",
              let: { order_item: "$item", order_qty: "$ordered" },
              pipeline: [
                 { $match: 
                    { $expr: 
                       { $and: 
                          [ 
                            { $eq: [ "$stock_item",  "$$order_item" ] }, 
                            { $gte: [ "$instock", "$$order_qty" ] }
                          ] 
                       }
                    }
                 },
                 { $project: { stock_item: 0, _id: 0 } }
              ],
              as: "stockdata"
            }
       }
   ])

The operation returns the following documents:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "item" : "abc", "price" : 12, "ordered" : 2,
      "stockdata" : [ { "warehouse" : "A", "instock" : 120 },
                      { "warehouse" : "B", "instock" : 60 } ] }
   { "_id" : 2, "item" : "jkl", "price" : 20, "ordered" : 1,
      "stockdata" : [ { "warehouse" : "A", "instock" : 80 } ] }
   { "_id" : 3, "item" : "xyz", "price" : 10, "ordered" : 60, 
      "stockdata" : [ { "warehouse" : "A", "instock" : 80 } ] }

The operation would correspond to the following pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT *, stockdata
   FROM orders
   WHERE stockdata IN (SELECT warehouse, instock
                       FROM warehouses
                       WHERE stock_item= orders.item
                       AND instock >= orders.ordered );

.. _lookup-uncorrelated-subuery:

Uncorrelated Subquery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 3.6

   MongoDB 3.6 adds support for executing a pipeline on the joined
   collection, which allows for specifying multiple join conditions as
   well as uncorrelated sub-queries.

Create a collection ``absences`` with the following documents:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.absences.insert([
      { "_id" : 1, "student" : "abc", sickdays: [ new Date ("2018-05-01"),new Date ("2018-08-23") ] },
      { "_id" : 2, "student" : "xyz", sickdays: [ new Date ("2018-02-01"),new Date ("2018-05-23") ] },
   ])

Create another collection ``holidays`` with the following documents:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.holidays.insert([
      { "_id" : 1, year: 2018, name: "New Years", date: new Date("2018-01-01") },
      { "_id" : 2, year: 2018, name: "Pi Day", date: new Date("2018-03-14") },
      { "_id" : 3, year: 2018, name: "Ice Cream Day", date: new Date("2018-07-15") },
      { "_id" : 4, year: 2017, name: "New Years", date: new Date("2017-01-01") },
      { "_id" : 5, year: 2017, name: "Ice Cream Day", date: new Date("2017-07-16") }
   ])

The following operation joins the ``orders`` collection with the
``warehouse`` collection by the item and whether the quantity in stock
is sufficient to cover the ordered quantity:

.. cssclass:: copyable-code

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.absences.aggregate([
      {
         $lookup:
            {
              from: "holidays",
              pipeline: [
                 { $match: { year: 2018 } },
                 { $project: { _id: 0, date: { name: "$name", date: "$date" } } },
                 { $replaceRoot: { newRoot: "$date" } }
              ],
              as: "holidays"
            }
       }
   ])

The operation returns the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id" : 1, "student" : "abc", "sickdays" : [ ISODate("2018-05-01T00:00:00Z"), ISODate("2018-08-23T00:00:00Z") ], 
      "holidays" : [ { "name" : "New Years", "date" : ISODate("2018-01-01T00:00:00Z") }, { "name" : "Pi Day", "date" : ISODate("2018-03-14T00:00:00Z") }, { "name" : "Ice Cream Day", "date" : ISODate("2018-07-15T00:00:00Z") } ] }
   { "_id" : 2, "student" : "xyz", "sickdays" : [ ISODate("2018-02-01T00:00:00Z"), ISODate("2018-05-23T00:00:00Z") ],

The operation would correspond to the following pseudo-SQL statement:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT *, holidays
   FROM absences
   WHERE holidays IN (SELECT name, date
                       FROM holidays
                       WHERE year = 2018);
