   Quick Reference contains information on different expressions, such
   as field paths, and expression objects. Make appropriate edits.

   :description: Contains a list of aggregation operators to use in aggregation stages.

The aggregation pipeline operators are compatible with MongoDB Atlas and on-premise environments.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/operators-toc-explanation.rst

.. COMMENT - this page omits the sections on Expressions in general
   as well as Literals, Field Paths, and Expression Objects which
   are in the /reference/aggregation-quick-reference.txt.
   This page only focuses on operators.

.. include:: /includes/extracts/agg-operators-accumulators-group.rst

Accumulators (in Other Stages)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some operators that are available as accumulators for the
:pipeline:`$group` stage are also available for use in other stages but
not as accumulators. When used in these other stages, these operators
do not maintain their state and can take as input either a single
argument or multiple arguments. For details, refer to the specific
operator page.
