  If either the MongoDB deployment requires authentication or the |mms|
  group has authentication enabled, you may import
  the MongoDB's users and roles for |mms| to manage. The imported users and
  roles will be :guilabel:`Synced` to all deployments in the |mms|
  group.

  .. warning::

     If the ``Enforce Consistent Set`` value for the |mms| group is
     ``YES``, any users and roles not imported are deleted from the MongoDB
     deployment.

  If the ``Enforce Consistent Set`` value for the |mms| group is
  ``No``, any users and roles not imported remain in the MongoDB
  deployment and are not managed by |mms|.

  To import users and roles:

  a. Check :guilabel:`Yes, import users and roles from this deployment
     item` to have |mms| manage these MongoDB users and roles.

  b. Click :guilabel:`Continue`.

ref: resolve-conflicts
content: |
  If you chose to import the MongoDB users and roles and one or more
  conflict with those already in the automated deployment, you are
  prompted to select which versions of the users and roles should be
  used:

  a. Select the correct user or role.

  b. Click :guilabel:`Review & Deploy`. 

  .. warning::

     If you choose not to resolve conflicts, the conflicting
     records are overridden by the current configuration. Any
     non-conflicting users can be imported later. You can create
     new, or modify existing, users and roles for the added deployment
     once it is under automation.

     See :doc:`/tutorial/manage-users` for how to create or modify
     users and :doc:`/reference/user-roles` for the list and
     definitions of roles in |mms|.
