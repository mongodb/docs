Cluster topology affects how nodes are arranged within a cluster. Topology 
impacts the availability and performance of your MongoDB deployment. 

The topology you choose can affect how ``mongosync`` synchronizes data between 
clusters.

Requirements
------------

:ref:`c2c-mongosync` supports two cluster topologies: 

- :ref:`Replica sets <replication>`

- :ref:`Sharded clusters <sharded-cluster>`

If you are syncing a sharded cluster to another sharded cluster, they are not 
required to have the same number of shards.

``mongosync`` doesn't support sync from a sharded cluster to a replica set.

Get Started
-----------

- To sync a replica set to a replica set, see the 
  :ref:`Quick Start Guide <c2c-quickstart>`.

- To sync a replica set to a sharded cluster, see :ref:`c2c-rs-to-sharded`.

- To sync a sharded cluster to another sharded cluster, see 
  :ref:`c2c-sharded-clusters`.
