|service| supports `Network Peering <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_cloud>`_
connections for |aws|, |gcp|, and |azure|-backed clusters.

.. important::

   To set up a Network Peering connection, you must have either the :authrole:`Project Owner`
   or :authrole:`Organization Owner` role.

Configure the |service| CIDR
----------------------------

You can configure the |service| CIDR for a Network Peering connection if you
have not yet added any clusters or network peering connections to an |service| project.
You may configure the Atlas CIDR for ``M0/M2/M5`` clusters *after* adding them to a project.
If you are unable to configure the |service| CIDR, create a new |service| project, or 
peform the following procedure on the tab corresponding to your cluster's cloud provider.


.. tabs-cloud-providers::

     tabs:

     - id: aws
       content: |

         Remove all AWS-backed clusters deployed in the same AWS region as your
         Network Peering connection to enable configuration of the |service| CIDR.

     - id: gcp
       content: |

         Remove all GCP-backed MongoDB clusters from the |service| project to enable
         configuration of the |service| CIDR.


     - id: azure
       content: |

         Remove all Azure-backed MongoDB clusters from the |service| project to
         enable configuration of the |service| CIDR.

Configure an |service| Network Peering Connection
-------------------------------------------------

To configure |service| Network Peering for a cluster, perform the procedure on the tab
corresponding to your cluster's cloud provider.

         1. In the :guilabel:`Security` section of the left navigation,
            click :guilabel:`Network Access`. 

         #. In the :guilabel:`Peering` tab, click :icon-fa5:`plus`
            :guilabel:`New Peering Connection`.

         #. Enable DNS hostnames and DNS resolution in AWS.

            Enabling :guilabel:`DNS hostnames` and :guilabel:`DNS
            resolution` can result in faster :ref:`VPC <security-vpc>` peering.

            a. Log in to your :abbr:`AWS (Amazon Web Services)` account.
            
            #. Go to the `VPC dashboard <https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc>`_.
            
            #. Open your list of VPC resources.
            
            #. Select the VPC you want to peer with.
            
            #. Enable :guilabel:`DNS hostnames` and :guilabel:`DNS
               resolution`. See `Updating DNS Support for Your VPC
               <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-updating>`_ 
               for further documentation on how to enable these options.

         #.  Go to :guilabel:`Network Access` view in |service|.

             In the :guilabel:`Security` section of the left navigation, click
             :guilabel:`Network Access`.

         #. Click the :guilabel:`Peering` tab.

         #. Click :guilabel:`New Peering Connection`.

         #. In the :guilabel:`Peering Connection` modal, select :guilabel:`AWS`

                 - AWS Account ID of the owner of the peer VPC. Refer to the
                   dialog for instructions on finding your :guilabel:`AWS
                   Account ID`.

               * - :guilabel:`VPC ID`

                 - The ID of the peer VPC. Refer to the dialog

               * - :guilabel:`VPC CIDR`

                 - The |aws| VPC CIDR block or subset. Must not overlap with your
                   :guilabel:`Atlas CIDR Block` or any other Network Peering connection
                   :guilabel:`VPC CIDR`.

                   The CIDR block must be in one of the following 
                   `private networks <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918#section-3>`_:

                   - ``10.0.0.0`` - ``10.255.255.255``  (10/8 prefix)

                   - ``172.16.0.0`` - ``172.31.255.255``  (172.16/12 prefix)

                   - ``192.168.0.0`` - ``192.168.255.255`` (192.168/16 prefix)

                   You can choose to add the VPC CIDR block address (or a
                   subset) to the whitelist. For Network Peering connections, you
                   can also add the Security Group associated with the |aws| VPC
                   instead of the CIDR block. See :ref:`add-to-whitelist`.

                   See `RFC 4632 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632>`_ for more
                   information about CIDR blocks.

               * - :guilabel:`Application VPC Region`

                 - AWS region where the |aws| VPC resides.

               * - :guilabel:`VPC CIDR`

                 - The |aws| VPC CIDR block. Must not overlap with the |service|
                   :guilabel:`VPC CIDR` block.

               * - :guilabel:`Atlas VPC Region`

                 - AWS region where the |service| VPC resides. |service|
                   creates a VPC for the |service| project in this region if no
                   ``M10+`` clusters or VPC peering connections exist for the
                   selected :guilabel:`Region`.

                   Uncheck :guilabel:`Same as application VPC region` to select
                   a different region than where the application VPC resides.

         #. Click :guilabel:`Initiate Peering`.

         #. Wait for approval of peering connection request

            The owner of the peer VPC must approve the VPC peering connection
            request. Ensure that the owner approves the request.

            |service| provides instructions for approving the connection request.

            .. important:: Requests expire after 7 days.

         #. Add to route table

            a. In the :guilabel:`VPC Dashboard`, click :guilabel:`Route Tables`.

            #. Select the Route Table for your VPC.

            #. Click the :guilabel:`Routes` tab.

            #. Click :guilabel:`Edit Routes`.

            #. Click :guilabel:`Add route`.

            #. Add the |service| VPC's CIDR block to the :guilabel:`Destination`
               column.

            #. Add the AWS Peering Connection ID to the :guilabel:`Target`
               column.

               This value is prefixed with ``pcx-``.

            #. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

               .. note::

                  Each |service| project may have a maximum of 25 peering
                  connections.

               Once set up, you can edit or terminate VPC peering connection from the
               :guilabel:`Peering` table.

               You must add your VPC CIDR block address (or subset) or the
               Security Group associated with the peer VPC to the :ref:`whitelist
               <whitelist>` before your new VPC peer can connect to your |service|
               cluster.
