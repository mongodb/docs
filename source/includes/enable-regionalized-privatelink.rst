You can enable this setting only if your |service| project contains no replica sets.

You can't disable this setting if you have: 

- More than one private endpoint in more than one region, or
- More than one private endpoint in one region and one private
  endpoint in one or more regions.

You can create only sharded clusters when you enable the regionalized
private endpoint setting. You can't create replica sets.
